"What antenna on a BaoFeng UV-5R Pro will give me better reception?","61878","","<p>I am happy with my BaoFeng UV-5R Pro but the local UHV VHF repeater and simplex reception is terrible, even for contacts less than 50 kilometers. I assume that it's because the rubber-ducky antenna on it is terrible. What can I replace it with that is readily available commercially, costs less than $100 US, will give me a better handheld reception experience, and still maintain excellent portability (for my case, let's say that means less than 2.5 pounds antenna weight, less than 3 feet tall)?</p>

<p>I don't know much about dBi gain, but I have seen antennas claiming to be ""144Mhz 2.15dBi 430Mhz 3.0dBi"", I'm still learning so I don't know how to interpret that information.</p>
","<p>Every time I purchase a cheap HT such as the Baofeng you mention I also spend another $10 or so on an antenna, as the stock antenna is noticeably worse than even an inexpensive antenna like the <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00BY3XN7E"">Nagoya NA-771</a>.</p>

<p>There are still better antennas than this, but there are always tradeoffs.  The stock antenna is one third to half the length of the NA-771, which is useful in certain situations.  There are vastly better, but more expensive, antennas that mount on and off the radio.</p>

<p>What you need will depend largely on what you're going to use the radio for.  Given that you've chosen an inexpensive, low power (even for handheld) radio, though, I suspect you're really looking to improve things as much as possible while still retaining the portability and use as a handheld, without a lot of cost.</p>

<p>So the above antenna is my current recommendation in this situation.  </p>

"Using my Baofeng UV-5R to talk to walkie talkies","55409","","<p>I have a few walkie talkies at home and sometimes I connect my UV-5R to them to talk to them and act as another walkie talkie. At one time, I built a little simplex repeater out of it. Should I not be doing this? I don't think the other walkie talkie users care about me doing this, just knowing the FCC, they might freak out or something crazy.</p>

<p>I used the 462.562 frequency.</p>
","<p>The GMRS and FRS bands are governed by the FCC and have <a href=""http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=e593ed9f147a6ee87a8803d05b9667c9&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title47/47cfr95_main_02.tpl"">specific requirements</a> not just for use and power output, but for equipment that is allowed.  One of the requirements is that radios used for GMRS service be <a href=""http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=e593ed9f147a6ee87a8803d05b9667c9&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title47/47cfr95_main_02.tpl"">part 95</a> certified and FCC certified for GMRS use:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>§95.129   Station equipment.</p>
  
  <p>Every station in a GMRS system must use transmitters the FCC has certificated for use in the GMRS. Write to any FCC Field Office to find out if a particular transmitter has been certificated for the GMRS. All station equipment in a GMRS system must comply with the technical rules in part 95.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The FRS rules are just as strict:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>§95.194   (FRS Rule 4) FRS units.</p>
  
  <p>(a) You may only use an FCC certified FRS unit. (You can identify an FCC certified FRS unit by the label placed on it by the manufacturer.)</p>
  
  <p>(b) You must not make, or have made, any internal modification to an FRS unit. Any internal modification cancels the FCC certification and voids your authority to operate the unit in the FRS.</p>
  
  <p>(c) You may not attach any antenna, power amplifier, or other apparatus to an FRS unit that has not been FCC certified as part of that FRS unit. There are no exceptions to this rule and attaching any such apparatus to a FRS unit cancels the FCC certification and voids everyone's authority to operate the unit in the FRS.</p>
  
  <p>(d) FRS units are prohibited from transmitting data in store-and-forward packet operation mode.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The FCC does not have a process to self-certify radios, so you can't declare the radio certified.  If you have an Amateur Radio license you'll find that the FRS and GMRS frequencies aren't available under that license.</p>

<p>So according to FCC rules, your use of the UV-5R is not acceptable on that frequency.</p>

"Which HF bands are best during the day and which are better at night?","26118","","<p>I am rather new to HF operation and have recently purchased my first HF rig. I have read about bands being ""open"" and ""closed"" based on various conditions including time of day. As I have been listening, I have been bouncing around all the bands from 80 meters through 6 meters, but I am not sure which are better for me to try to make contacts on. I have heard that certain bands are more appropriate for daylight operation and others are better at night, but which are which?</p>
","<p>HF propagation over long distances is by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skywave"" rel=""noreferrer"">skywave propagation</a>, the reflection and refraction of radio waves between Earth's surface and the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere"" rel=""noreferrer"">ionosphere</a>. The ionosphere is a consequence of radiation from the sun ionizing Earth's atmosphere, so it changes significantly with time of day and <a href=""http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/SunspotCycle.shtml"" rel=""noreferrer"">sunspot activity</a>.</p>

<p>Although time of day is just one of many variables, here is a simplified model of the ionosphere:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wqRCM.png"" alt=""ionosphere day vs night""></p>

<p>The F layer is mostly responsible for the refraction of radio waves back to Earth, preventing them from escaping to space. The other layers interact in other ways. During the day, the D layer forms, and the F layer splits into F1 and F2 layers.</p>

<p>The D layer is present during the day and is a good absorber of radio waves, increasing losses. Higher frequencies are absorbed less, so higher bands (20m to 10m or so) tend to perform better. Above the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_frequency"" rel=""noreferrer"">critical frequency</a>, the ionosphere is unable to refract the signal back to Earth and it escapes to space. The critical frequency during the day is in the neighborhood of 6m: depending on the space weather, 6m way work for skywave, or it may not.</p>

<p>During the night we need not contend with D layer absorption, but the critical frequency is lower, so higher frequencies can not support skywave propagation. This can be observed on a <a href=""http://www.spacew.com/www/fof2.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">map of critical frequency</a>: see that the critical frequency is typically lowest around dawn, when the ionosphere has been in the dark the longest.</p>

<p>So, very rough rule of thumb:</p>

<ul>
<li>20m, being in the middle, works to some extent day or night.</li>
<li>Lower frequency bands work best at night.</li>
<li>Higher frequency bands work best during the day.</li>
<li>The farther from 20m you get in either direction, the more pronounced these effects are.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, given that space weather is just as variable as Earth weather, there are exceptions to these rules every day.</p>

"Can I reduce RFI/noise at the antenna?","17428","","<p>Recently, the power was out in my neighborhood for an extended period of time. I fired up my HF rig using battery power and was amazed at the lack of noise across the HF bands. </p>

<p>When the power grid came back online, the noise returned. The difference was drastic. S2 vs. S9 drastic.</p>

<p>With that said, is there a good way to reduce RFI/noise at the antenna? Specifically a dipole antenna? Is there a better way to solve this problem?</p>

<p>The houses are packed so close together in my neighborhood, the likelihood of eliminating the noise at the source(s) is nil. For reference, the type of ""noise"" I'm hearing is more of a white noise rather than a noise pattern coming from an interfering appliance. (Though, I do hear RFI with a pattern to it from time to time on certain bands as well.)</p>
","<p>First, I'd be sure it's actually the antenna picking up the noise, and not something else. <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/q/538/218"">If you don't have a balun on that dipole</a>, probably your feedline is picking up all the noise in your house.</p>

<p>Any other wires attached to your receiver can also make good noise antennas, especially the power cord, which is attached to your home's wiring, and coupled to all the noisy stuff running on it. Get some ferrite beads designed for EMI control, and start snapping them on any wire attached to the receiver. Keep snapping them on until you stop getting improvement.</p>

<p>If you have cooperative neighbors, do the same to their noisy electronics. Ferrite beads work for keeping EMI out of your receiver, and also for preventing it from leaving the source in the first place.</p>

<p>Once that's done, the next thing is to get the antenna as far away from other noise sources as possible. Powerlines, neighbors, etc. Put it on the tallest tower allowed in your neighborhood. In urban areas, your options are limited, but do what you can.</p>

<p>The rest is just trying to null the noise based on its direction, or it's polarization, or something else. Every antenna has a particular polarization and radiation pattern. You don't know the same of your noise sources, but just by playing with the orientation of the antenna you might by chance find an arrangement that works well. Try not to be parallel to power lines, etc. A directional antenna helps, but is probably impracticably large at HF.</p>

<p>At this point, you are running out of options. Some of the noise is in the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_and_far_field"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">far field</a> of the antenna, and there just isn't much you can do about this besides move.</p>

<p>Other noise is in the near field, which at HF, can be quite big. In this region your antenna isn't acting as an antenna, but rather one winding of a transformer, or one plate of a capacitor.</p>

<p>There is one additional game you can play here that might help. Remember that <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">electromagnetic radiation</a> is made of two fields: an electric field and a magnetic field. In the far field, these two are inseparably linked, related by the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impedance_of_free_space"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">impedance of free space</a>. However, in the near field, you can have a strong electric field and a weak magnetic field (capacitors), or vice-versa (transformers).</p>

<p>You can build different antennas which, at some distance in the near-field, have a different sensitivity to one type of field or the other. <a href=""http://www.w8ji.com/magnetic_receiving_loops.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">W8JI has a good article on small loop antennas</a>, and describes this in some detail. In particular, there's this great graph:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7vVbu.gif"" alt=""dipole and loop impedance vs. distance""></p>

<p>A high impedance means the antenna is more sensitive to electric rather than magnetic fields. So, you can see that if your noise source is very close (less than 10 meters for this antenna) and is largely E-field noise, you'd want a loop.</p>

<p>However, keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>the impedance of all antennas are <em>identical</em> and equal to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impedance_of_free_space"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the impedance of free space (377Ω)</a> in the far-field. This only makes a difference for noise sources in the near-field, which couple to your receiver by mutual inductance or capacitance, <em>not</em> EM radiation.</li>
<li>the impedance changes up and down in the near-field with distance, and if a particular antenna seems to have less noise, it's due to chance and your particular noise source's characteristics, not some magical  ""noise immunity"" intrinsic to some antenna design.</li>
</ul>

<p>That said, most people already have dipoles, so if they find them noisy, sometimes they have luck switching to a loop, which provides a complementary near-field impedance, and just might be better in a particular environment.</p>

"Should I chose a vertical or a horizontal HF antenna?","17362","","<p>If I only have the budget for one HF antenna, should I chose a vertical or a horizontal antenna?</p>
","<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>If you can have only one antenna and can chose between a vertical HF antenna or <em>a relatively high</em> horizontal HF antenna, <strong>go for the horizontal antenna.</strong></p>

<h2>Modelling results</h2>

<p>In January 2008, L. B. Cebik, W4RNL (SK) published what was going to be the last entry of his seminal <em>10-10 News</em> series. It turned out to be an interesting gain comparison of <a href=""http://w4rnl.net46.net/ant58.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">single element 28.4MHz antennas modelled over various ground types</a> of which a summary is presented here (Table 1). His findings seem to fit well with what John Devoldere, ON4UN modelled and <a href=""https://www.arrl.org/shop/ON4UN-s-Low-Band-DXing"" rel=""noreferrer"">published for equivalent antennas on the lower HF bands</a>.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TWeLF.png"" alt=""Gain &amp; elevation angle of single element 28.4MHz antennas over various ground types""></p>

<h2>Horizontal HF antennas: near-by ground gain</h2>

<p>At a height of about λ/2, the nearby ground reflection of a horizontal HF antenna will start to be constructive at interesting take-off angles for long- distance ionospheric contacts. This will provide a net <em>gain</em> over the antenna in free-space.</p>

<h2>Vertical HF antennas: near-by ground loss</h2>

<p>This is not the case with vertical HF antennas. Nearby ground only contributes loss. This even more so when the ground forms part of the return path of the radiating structure. Even when far-away ground reflections may cause the <em>directivity</em> of a vertical HF antenna at low take-off angles to be much higher than that of a horizontal HF antenna, its net <em>gain</em> will still be lower at those angles. <strong>This makes the horizontal HF antenna a clear winner</strong>, at least for what transmission is concerned. Note that gain and directivity are not synonyms; <em>gain takes into account losses, directivity does not.</em></p>

<h2>Vertical HF antennas still remain useful</h2>

<p>Vertical HF antennas do have their merit though. At the lower end of the HF spectrum, the λ/2 height requirement for horizontal antennas can become cumbersome (even though a horizontal phased array may weaken this requirement by allowing somewhat lower heights). A vertical HF antenna can get away with a height of only λ/4. Furthermore, the directivity of a vertical HF antenna can be effectively employed at the reception end to cancel out high-angle interference by near-by stations. This is why some stations use receive-only phased-arrays of verticals on the low bands.</p>

<h2>Polarisation at HF</h2>

<p>Polarisation is not really an issue at HF (apart from lightning and man-made noise considerations). This is so because the ionosphere is mainly an anisotropic medium, i.e. it messes up polarisation.</p>

"What is a Gamma match in the context of the driven element of a Yagi antenna?","16432","","<p>How (and why) does a Gamma match work, when used on the driven element of a Yagi antenna? As shown here:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.iw5edi.com/ham-radio/files/2elyagi10m_4.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.iw5edi.com/ham-radio/files/2elyagi10m_4.jpg</a></p>

<p>The article describes a 10 meter Yagi where the driven element is one continuous conductor and not the classic dipole-halves driven by 50 ohm coax. I have seen other designs where Gamma matches were used on split folded dipole elements joined on the far end. Clearly capacitance is the key, but I don't understand how it can work efficiently.</p>
","<p>A gamma-match serves a triple purpose:</p>

<ol>
<li>As a small diameter wire parallel and in close vicinity with the main radiating element, it will carry only a fraction of the main element current while being exposed to the same electrical field strength. This turns it in <strong>an effective up-transformer of the antenna input impedance</strong>.</li>
<li>It also forms together with the main radiating element <strong>a closed wire stub</strong>, adding inductance to the antenna input impedance. If this is not required for matching, the additional inductance can be cancelled out with a lumped capacitor in series.</li>
<li>Not shown on your figure but on the picture below: The sheath of the coaxial feed-line is connected to the center of the main radiating element. When properly connected, a gamma-match also serves as a balanced to unbalanced converter or <strong>balun</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>All these functions are highly desirable for matching the unbalanced characteristic impedance of the coaxial feed-line to the much lower balanced impedance of a Yagi-antenna.</p>

<p>I'm not interested in aiming right now, so an omnidirectional antenna would be best.  I do have a 25' attic I can use if needed.</p>

<p>*<sub>Is almost certainly...</sub></p>
","<p>Receive antennas are the <em>easiest thing ever</em>. You just need two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>something that conducts electricity</li>
<li>another thing that conducts electricity</li>
</ol>

<p>Attach one to the center contact on a BNC connector. Connect another to the shield. Boom, done. If you can't find two things, then one can be the Earth.</p>

<p>Alternately, you can use two ends of one thing that encircles something that permits magnetic fields (like, air).</p>

<p>Until you are approaching a significant fraction of a wavelength (like, 1/4 wavelength), then making either thing bigger will get you more signal. However, once you have enough signal that you are well above your receiver's noise floor, more signal won't make you receive any better: it will just give you louder noise. I'd say, however much space you have, make it that big.</p>

<p>Don't worry about tuning, or impedance matching. This also will increase the fraction of the energy received by your antenna coupled to the receiver, but again, once you have enough to overcome the receiver's noise, more is of absolutely no help. See <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/q/382/218"">What is the relationship between SWR and receive performance?</a></p>

<p>Don't worry about polarization. At HF most of your signals will arrive via the ionosphere which is constantly swirling and changing the polarization of received signals. Whatever polarization you pick, it will be the wrong one in 30 seconds, so don't worry about it.</p>

<p>If you really <em>must</em> worry about something, worry about getting your antenna away from noise sources. Your house, being full of all varieties of noisy digital electronics, is very noisy. If you can get an antenna away from these things, that's good. You must also take care to avoid making the feedline part of the antenna.

<p>The $492/f$ formula is a conversion from metric units to English units for the fundamental frequency and wavelength ($\lambda$) formula. $c = 3\times 10^8_{m/s}$ (the velocity of light) and $f =$ frequency -- </p>

<p>\begin{equation}
\lambda = \frac{c}{f}
\end{equation}</p>

<p>This gives the length of a full wavelength in meters. This formula is correct if the conductor is infinitely thin and other objects are infinitely far away from the antenna.</p>

<p>The length of a real, installed antenna is affected by the diameter of the conductor (not a big effect for wire antennas) and the height above ground (a big effect). Capacitance to ground electrically shortens the antenna, so less wire is needed for resonance.</p>

<p>$468/f$ is a good estimate for wire antennas at HF less than a wavelength above ground. This is an empirical formula, so there is no mathematical derivation. The $468/f$ formula was first published in the 1929 <em>ARRL Handbook</em>. It is probably based on experience with 40m and 80m antennas at heights of 1/4 to 1/8 wavelength above ground, since those were common antennas at the time.</p>

<p>A November 2009 <em>QST</em> article by Ward Silver, N0AX, measured a 20m dipole at heights from 1/8 to 2 wavelengths and found the length varied from $466/f$ to $481/f$ depending on height. He recommends starting with a wire length of $490/f$ and expecting to shorten the antenna to resonance.</p>

<p>Most wire antennas need length adjustment for resonance after installation, because of the capacitance to nearby structures or trees, or local ground conductivity. It is much easier to shorten an antenna than to lengthen it, so it is a good idea to cut the antenna wire a little long.</p>

<p>For more on this publication history of this formula, see <a href=""http://www.eham.net/articles/23802"">this article by N0AX</a>.</p>

<p>For more information about wire antennas, I would start with Chapter 21 of the <em>ARRL Handbook</em>. For details, read the <em>ARRL Antenna Book</em>.</p>

"How can you calculate the frequencies for each band?","11131","","<p>I've just started studying for my HAM license a couple of weeks ago, so please excuse me if this is a remedial question...</p>

<p>I have the <em>Canadian Amateur Radio Basic Qualification Study Guide</em> (which I'm finding is terribly hard to understand). Their explanations of just about everything appear to be missing pertinent information that allow the reader to connect the dots and consequently I'm struggling to understand what they're explaining... anyway, the book discusses a formula which supposedly allows you to determine the bond between frequencies and their band - i.e. the calculation in the book tells me that 300 / Wavelength = Frequency... where one is to assume that 300 is a rough simile of the speed of light in millions of meters per second. The book suggests the resultant frequency is approximately (within some unexplained tolerance) the middle of the bandwidth for that band plan. </p>

<p>I'm noticing that using this formula for many bands the resulting frequency doesn't fall within the suggested frequency range for that plan and where they do, many don't fall within any discernible tolerance of the middle.</p>

<p>For example: </p>

<ul>
<li>20m band = 300 / 20 = 15.000 MHz, whereas the book suggests the frequency band falls between 14.000 - 14.350 MHz. (Clearly 15.000 MHz falls outside that range)</li>
<li>2m band = 300 / 2 = 150.000 MHz, whereas the book suggests the frequency band falls between 144.000 - 148.000 MHz.</li>
<li>33cm band = 300 / 0.33m = 909.091 MHz, a long way from the middle of the suggested frequency band of 902.000 - 928.000 MHz</li>
</ul>

<p>Even if I substitute the more accurate (according to Google) measurement of c being 299,792,458 m/s, I arrive at 14.990 MHz for 20m, still not within the frequency band.</p>

<p>Clearly I'm missing something, can someone explain what I'm not understanding?</p>
","<p>$$ \frac{c}{ \text{frequency}} = \text{wavelength}$$
$$ \frac{c}{ \text{wavelength}} = \text{frequency}$$</p>

<p>The above relation is a fact of physics. It's true unconditionally (provided you are using consistent units, e.g. wavelength in meters and $c$ in meters per second); it's how you convert between two different ways of measuring a wave.</p>

<p>The frequency limits, and names, of the bands are not physics; they were invented by humans. The frequency limits are a matter of the regulations that divide up the radio spectrum among many users. The limits of the amateur bands are semi-arbitrary.</p>

<p>The common names for the bands (""20 m"", ""2 m"", and so on) are simply <strong>the closest round number to the actual wavelengths</strong>. (In your example of 33 cm, note that 32 and 34 cm would be outside the band entirely. 33 is the best two-digit approximation.)</p>

<p>What your book <em>should</em> have told you is not that you can use the above relation to find the limits of the band, but that <strong>given that you already know the bands and frequencies, you can use it to find <em>which</em> band a frequency belongs to, or vice versa</strong>, because while the band names do not always fall in the frequency limits, the correct band/frequency will always be the <em>closest</em> match.</p>

<p>For example, $300/143 ≈ 2.098$, so we can conclude that 143 MHz is in the 2 m band <em>if it is in an amateur band at all</em>, which it <em>isn't</em> (but e.g. 145 MHz is).</p>

<p>If you wish to know the limits of bands, you must memorize them; there are no shortcuts. The relationship between wavelength and frequency can, however, be used to match up those limits to the wavelength-names of the bands.</p>

"How does a mag mount antenna achieve a ground plane?","11060","","<p>I've been thinking for some time about magnet mount mobile antennas and wondering how they establish their ground plane.  Consider that many mag mount antennas have some kind of protective coating on the magnet.  Consider also that most cars have a coat of paint between the mag mount and the sheet metal.  Both of these should result in some level of electrical isolation between the antenna feed shield and the sheet metal.</p>

<p>I guess what I'm simply not clear on is how a mag mount antenna's ground plane is connected electrically.  Or is this accomplished through inductance?</p>
","<p>There's <em>always</em> a ground.  Whether it's what you intend it to be or not is another issue...</p>

<p>A mag-mount antenna is grounded through capacitive coupling between that magnet and the metal it's stuck to.  At VHF/UHF frequencies, this effect is adequate for good results which explains the popularity of these mounts.  Some folks advocate adding a wire instead of relying on the coupling effect, but in most cases, this has little or no effect.  </p>

<p>At HF frequencies, it's a different story.  The capacitive effect is not enough and thorough grounding of the vehicle is usually indicated.  There are several good guides out on the internet, I suggest starting with K0BG's excellent <a href=""http://www.k0bg.com/"">site</a> on the ins and outs of mobile amateur radio oeprating.   </p>

Will a 2.4 GHz signal go that far, i.e. if I send WiFi signals from our rooftop is it possible to catch them on my phone 2 km away?</p>
","<p>This is a strange sort of question, as in reality the signal will go infinitely far (effectively) however you are really asking at what distance might a receiver be able to pick up the signal.</p>

<p>In testing a 2.4GHz signal with a 100mW omni antenna, the furthest distance I could receive a signal with less than 5% retries (802.11b kit) was 2 miles with a 100mW 3dB receiver. I could manage over 5 miles with a directional 10dB antenna, but had some trouble aiming it accurately.</p>

<p>Your phone is going to have challenges at that range, but if you have a specific location, you could use a directional antenna on your rooftop aimed at that location. Even a basic Huber Suhner running at 1W could make that work.</p>

"2m or 70cm FM mobile radio for digital mode operation","10494","","<p>Are there any 2m and/or 440cm FM mobile radios that have audio inputs for supporting digital modes, like PSK31 or SSTV?</p>

<p>I have a Rigblaster that I use with my HF radio so I could get a mike cable and connect it directly to the mike input in the same way, but is there any VHF/UHF radio available that has better options for connectivity for working digital modes on VHF/UHF?</p>
","<p><strong>Most modern VHF/UHF FM mobile rigs designed for Amateur Radio use have a ""data"" connector on the back.</strong> Currently manufactured dual-band examples include Yaesu FT-7900, Kenwood TM-V71, Icom IC-208H - they all have the same 6-pin mini-DIN ""data"" connector using the same main pinout.</p>

<p>The 6-pin data connector is originally designed for attaching packet radio TNCs and other data equipment, and usually has at least the following pins:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ground</li>
<li>TX audio in (transmitted audio)</li>
<li>PTT (ground to transmit)</li>
<li>RX audio out, ""1200 bit/s"" ""normal audio""</li>
<li>RX audio out, ""9600 bit/s"" discriminator output</li>
</ul>

<p>I quoted the bit rates, since the radio documentation often cites these standard packet radio speeds, although in reality it's just audio, and the radio doesn't really care about any bit rates as such. The ""9600"" pin audio output is taken before audio filter/amplifier stages of the radio, and has a flatter audio frequency response that is good for high speed data such as 9600 bit/s packet or AIS reception.</p>

<p><strong>Technically, you can run SSTV or PSK31 over FM, and that ""data"" connector will suit that purpose perfectly.</strong> But it's not overly popular in most areas, so you might have to talk some friends to play with it. Most of SSTV and PSK31 activity is on HF SSB, although VHF/UHF digital chat as such should be a lot of fun.</p>

<p>PSK31 over FM in particular is quite strange and unusual, since PSK31 is designed to be a very narrow-bandwidth (31.25 Hz) mode for SSB transceivers, and transmitting it over FM (some 20 KHz) would be a waste of perfectly good radio spectrum and transmitter power. It works, but it's not efficient. Then again, it might be fun, and <strong>if</strong> you live in an area where most of 70cm is almost completely quiet and inactive (like I do), a little inefficiency on an irregular basis is not going to do harm, if you're having fun. A lot of amateur FM voice communications don't have a lot of useful information content, either.</p>

<p>SSTV isn't so narrow (about 3 kHz), and there have been more or less official FM channel allocations for it. Some US web sites cite VHF/UHF SSTV AFSK FM calling frequencies. IARU Region 1 (Europe) SSTV(FM/AFSK) frequency for 70 cm is currently 433.400.</p>

<p>I also often use the ""data"" connector of my FT-7800 for recording received voice communications on a computer. Works fine.</p>

"Why are some 1:1 current baluns twice as complicated as others?","10207","","<p>I would like to add a balun/choke to my dipole for the reasons outlined in <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/questions/538/using-a-balun-with-a-resonant-dipole"">Using a balun with a resonant dipole</a>. In the spirit of continued kit and/or DIY building for my ham shack, I set out to investigate how I might best proceed ""from scratch"".</p>

<h2>Simply wind two conductors together over some sort of core?</h2>

<p>At <a href=""http://vk6ysf.com/balun_guanella_current_1-1.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://vk6ysf.com/balun_guanella_current_1-1.htm</a> a design is given for a 1:1 current balun that simply wraps a pair of wires around a toroidal core:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/f7yu7.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/f7yu7.gif"" alt=""Simple bifilar winding around toroid, unbalanced in and balanced out""></a></p>

<p>…or as <a href=""http://vk5ajl.com/projects/baluns.php#current"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://vk5ajl.com/projects/baluns.php#current</a> even shows:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YTgb8.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YTgb8.jpg"" alt=""A pair of wires wrapped around a nail""></a></p>

<p>I suppose the air-wound ""ugly balun"" as demonstrated at <a href=""http://www.hamuniverse.com/balun.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.hamuniverse.com/balun.html</a> also fits in this same category, unless using coax in place of the bifilar winding somehow changes things?</p>

<p>So that's all well and good, I guess.</p>

<h2>Two tangled toroids?</h2>

<p>But then — under the same ""Guanella balun"" name as the first diagram above, no less! — I find that <a href=""http://www.kn9b.us/guanella-balun"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.kn9b.us/guanella-balun</a> presents this diagram:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VK2lz.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VK2lz.jpg"" alt=""Schematic of a 1:1 current balun using two bifilar windings on two separate toroids""></a></p>

<p>…which is to be built using <em>two</em> toroids resulting in something that looks like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VZvAu.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VZvAu.jpg"" alt=""Current balun using two toroids, assembled in a project box""></a></p>

<p>Is there any benefit to this dual core balun over the single core type? What is the purpose of this sort of ""push-pull"" reminiscent design? Is it worth buying two toroids and going to twice the trouble of winding and sorting out which loose ends connect to which others, versus just winding a pair of wires around a rusty bolt, or wrapping some coax around some scrap PVC?</p>
","<p>Baluns are a source of <strong>much</strong> confusion in the hobby, and are probably one of the most common causes of RFI, common mode noise reception, and poor antenna performance. Folks try to shoe-horn a lot of very complex values and characteristics in to a very linear way of thinking, and most of it is just flat wrong.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Starting from the top: That design should in theory work fine, except the website is using a toroid for which I can find almost no tech data, and what little is available in the data sheet suggests it's meant for SMPS transformers and the like. This means it is quite likely to saturate, or potentially just not offer much of any choking impedance at higher frequencies. You <strong>might</strong> be able to justify using it for 160m, maybe even 80m, but above that, it's almost certainly at best ineffective, and at worst, very inefficient. Even on the lower frequencies, given the type of transformer they're typically used for, I suspect that choking impedance would be quite low.</p>

<p>The counter winding technique is also at best needlessly complicated, and at worst can act to increase parasitic capacitance within the transformer, causing a <strong>reduction</strong> in performance, not the commonly claimed improvement. W8JI, K9YC, and VK1OD all failed to find any evidence of the supposed elimination of saturation with that winding style, in reality it likely just causes a complex eddy current which may lead to localized saturation in some areas of the toroid but not others.</p>

<p>This design with a Type 43 or Type 31 (Amidon, Palomar, or Fair-Rite) T106 core would be fine for 40m and up on QRP, T200 or larger for 100w, especially if you want to operate below 40m). IIRC Type 77 or type 62 is typically recommended for frequencies from 10m to 2 meters.</p>

<p>Ditch the counter-winding technique, it's pointless and just complicates things. 14-18 bifilar turns of 18-14awg wire should do the trick for most of HF on the T240 cores.</p></li>
<li><p>The second design is a common failure to understand the concept of saturation. Yes, in theory for a 1:1 bifilar current choke, lossy material at the frequency you're using is desirable. Only the common mode current (the current that remains when the equal and opposite current on the two conductors cancel each other out) appears on the core, where it will ideally encounter very high impedance and be dissipated.</p>

<p>Random steel has very unpredictable (and almost certainly undesirable) saturation characteristics, and also may have wildly varying impedance across the range of HF frequencies, which means it may work fine on some frequencies, and/or at lower power, but again, at best it's likely to be ineffective on some bands, and at worse it may just turn most of your power to heat. This is particularly the case with an antenna that is anything more than almost perfectly balanced already. Use one of these on a dipole with elements that interact unevenly with surrounding objects or terrain, or worse, on something like an OCF dipole, and that thing will get extremely hot very quickly.</p></li>
<li><p>Third is a classic ""Ugly balun"" or air core solenoid balun. They CAN work, however because capacitance in the coil is quite high (without looking, I believe RG-8X is ~5pF/ft), they are self-resonant tank circuits. This means that they can present quite useful impedance on a couple of bands at most, but otherwise may be all but invisible on other bands. They can be strung together along the coax, but you end up using a lot of extra coax that equates to more loss, and it's far more expensive than just buying a proper toroid for $5.</p></li>
<li><p>The final design is a bit of a novelty to me, and is rather puzzling. It's done in the manner of a proper 4:1 current balun, and there's no reason it wouldn't work, but the design is counter-productive. Electrically the two cores are in parallel, acting as two parallel bifilar chokes. Presuming they are identical cores and windings, this will actually <strong>reduce</strong> choking impedance.</p>

<p>There doesn't seem to be any logical reason to do this unless you're constructing a balun to handle a <em>lot</em> of power, 500w or more, but then you'd still want them in series, just with less impedance per core. I suspect that the designer has read the technical discussions on why single core 4:1 voltage baluns are not baluns at all, but impedance transformers that provide little, if any, useful feedline isolation, and just took that to mean that you can't achieve isolation in any situation with 1 core. That statement only applies to a 4:1 balun due to the DC short that is present. A 1:1 bifilar winding is more than capable of providing good isolation on a single core on a wide range of frequencies.</p>

<p>A single T240-43 with 14awg magnet wire should be more than capable of dissipating the common mode current from even a moderately imbalanced antenna at 500w PEP without issue. The only reasons I can imagine using this final design this would be to compensate for poor component choice (saturation, perhaps) and perhaps it's an attempt to reduce the total current through each choke, or if he were using two different cores (it doesn't look like he is) to provide good choking impedance on two different frequency ranges, but again, they should be in series, not parallel.</p>

<p>That's another one that seems to needlessly complicate the situation because of a failure to grasp the basic qualities that a choke balun (as opposed to a true isolated winding transformer) should have.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you want 1:1, buy the right toroid, use large enough wire, and KISS. Baluns aren't magic. They aren't even really that complicated if you just stop and think about what they're actually supposed to do. Things get a little more complex when you need impedance transformation, but if you stick to the same basic design, it's hard to fail entirely. One bifilar winding per core, and design with parasitic capacitance in mind.</p>

<p>One of the best resources on this matter is the <a href=""http://audiosystemsgroup.com/RFI-Ham.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">K9YC RFI Bible</a>. You can find the 1:1 choke balun I described above, along with many other possible (and experimentally verified) designs, along with a teardown of some of the most popular (and least effective) designs you'll find ""in the wild"".</p>

  <p>Once you have defined your transmitter location, it is now time time create a RF coverage map for that location. To do this, select the “New Coverage” option in the menu. You will now see a number of data fields that you’ll need to complete with some already containing default values. An explanation of each of these is below.</p>
  
  <p>Centre Site – this is the location of your transmitter. Select your location using the pull down menu.</p>
  
  <p>Antenna Height – this is the height of your antenna above the ground at that specific location. Please note that this is in metres and if you want to convert your height in feet, divide the value by 3.2808 (i.e. 100 ft = 30.48 m).</p>
  
  <p>Antenna Type – this is the type of antenna that you will be using at the transmitter location. Unless you’ll be using an antenna with an offset gain, you should just use the default omnidirectional, or “Omni” setting.</p>
  
  <p>Antenna Azimuth – this is the direction that your antenna will be pointing, with 0° being north. This value is only important if you are using an antenna with an offset gain value, as it would not have any impact for an omnidirectional antenna.</p>
  
  <p>Antenna Tilt – this is the angle of radiation of your antenna with 0° point towards the horizon. Some antennas have a higher gain value point slightly upwards or downwards, so this setting can be used to address this.</p>
  
  <p>Antenna Gain – this is the amount of gain for your specific antenna. To find out the gain value for your antenna, you may need to check the specifications that are published for it by the manufacturer. Please note that the value for this field is in dBi (isotropic) – if your antenna has a dBd (dipole) value, you can covert dBd to dBi by adding 2.15 dBi (i.e. 5 dBd = 7.15 dBi).</p>
  
  <p>Mobile Antenna Height – this is the height of the receiving antenna on the mobile station that will be used to determine your coverage area. Again, please note that this is in metres and if you want to convert your height in feet, divide the value by 3.2808 (i.e. 10 ft = 3.48 m).</p>
  
  <p>Mobile Antenna Gain – this is the gain of the receiving antenna on the mobile station that will be used to determine your coverage area. Please note that the value for this field is in dBi (isotropic) – if your antenna has a dBd (dipole) value, you can covert dBd to dBi by adding 2.15 dBi (i.e. 5 dBd = 7.15 dBi).</p>
  
  <p>Frequency – this is the frequency that your transmitter will use. Radio Mobile Online allows frequencies to be used within amateur radio bands from 10 MHz to 250 GHz.</p>
  
  <p>TX Power – this is the power output of your transmitter in Watts.</p>
  
  <p>TX Line Loss – this is the power loss in your feed line cable between the transmitter and antenna at your transmitter location. The longer the feed line, the higher this value will be. To find the value, you should check with the cable manufactures specification for your feed line and calculate the total loss based upon the length of your cable. For added precision, you can also include the power loss in your connectors as well.</p>
  
  <p>RX Line Loss – this is the signal loss of the feed line for your receiving station in dBi.</p>
  
  <p>RX Threshold – this is the lowest signal level that the coverage map will display. While most radios have better receive sensitivity than this, this value will provide a good indication for coverage for all radios, including older one with less sensitive receivers.</p>
  
  <p>Required Reliability – this figure displays the reliability to which the coverage is likely to experience. For more accurate coverage maps, you can increase this value, however the resulting coverage area will less.</p>
  
  <p>Maximum Range – this value defines the limit of the coverage analysis. If you expect coverage beyond 100 km, then increase this value to show coverage beyond 100 km. Please note that if you want to convert from miles to kms, multiply by 1.6 (i.e. 100 mi = 160 km).</p>
  
  <p>Once you have entered all of this information, Radio Mobile Online will begin generating the RF coverage map for your transmitter location. Depending on the details entered and the time of day to which you have requested the RF coverage map to be generated, it may take anywhere from a few minutes to 20 minutes to produce the coverage map. Once it’s complete, a map will appear displaying your RF coverage area. To save this RF coverage map, click “Add to my coverages”.</p>
  
  <p>One important note for coverage maps being generated in major cities is that Radio Mobile Online does not have building information included in its database, so the coverage maps it produces will not reflect the impact of buildings on the signals proportion. The result of this will be coverage maps that are not representative of the actual signal levels that a users may experience, especially in urban areas.</p>
  
  <p>So there you go – you’re now on your way to creating professional looking RF coverage maps that can be used to determine how good that proposed repeater site will be that can shared with friends or posted online.</p>

"How can one convert from Lat/Long to Grid Square?","9646","","<p>I see that many contests, awards, and other items, use Grid Squares as a means to identify where one is. How can one figure out what one's grid square is, given lat/long?</p>
","<p>First of all, if you don't want to do any math, then check out a grid square map, such as <a href=""http://f6fvy.free.fr/qthLocator/fullScreen.php"">this one</a>.</p>

<p>There is an excellent process at <a href=""http://www.newsvhf.com/my-grid.html"">this page</a>, and additional resources from <a href=""http://www.arrl.org/grid-squares"">ARRL</a>. Essentially, Grid Squares contain 3 pairs, the first and last letters, and the middle numbers. Longitude is always the first, followed by latitude, for each pair. For simplicity, let's assume that West and South are negative lat/long, as is a common convention. For example purposes, I'm going to use 32.123 W, 14.321 N. The key thing is to do the following.:</p>

<p><strong>Longitude</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Add 180 to the longitude, and take the integer value /20, and add one. Then figure out which letter of the alphabet that corresponds to, usually written in upper case. The example will be 147.877/20=7. Adding one will give the 8th letter of the alphabet, or H. Note 7.877 is remaining.</li>
<li>Take the remainder of what is left, and divide by 2, rounding down. This is the number, no conversion required. The example will give a value of 3. Note 1.877 is remaining.</li>
<li>Take the remainder that is left, and multiply by 12, and add one. Round down to the nearest integer.. This is the letter of the alphabet, usually written in lower case. The example gives a value of 22+1=23. This will be the letter w.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Latitude</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Add 90 to the longitude, and take the integer value /10, and add one. Then figure out which letter of the alphabet that corresponds to, usually written in upper case. The example will be 104.321/10=10. Adding one will give the 11th letter of the alphabet, or K. Note 4.321 is remaining.</li>
<li>Take the remainder of what is left, and round down. This is the number, no conversion required. The example will give a value of 4. Note 0.321 is remaining.</li>
<li>Take the remainder that is left, and multiply by 24, and add one. Round down to the nearest integer.. This is the letter of the alphabet, usually written in lower case. The example gives a value of 7+1=8. This will be the letter h.</li>
</ol>

<p>Putting them together by pairs, and alternating first longitude then latitude, gives the grid square for 32.123 W, 14.321 N to be HK34wh.</p>

"End-fed wire antenna lengths","9566","","<p>I want to use an end-fed wire antenna, but what would be the best length of wire for the 20m and 40m bands?</p>

<p>Is there a way to work this out?</p>

<p>This is assuming a tuner will be used.</p>
","<p>The length doesn't matter much. If you make it the right length, then it will present a good match to your feedline, but if you have a tuner, and either place it near the antenna or use a low-loss feedline, then that doesn't matter.</p>

<p>It's also possible to get really unlucky and pick a wire length that's outside of your tuner's range. What these lengths are depend on your tuner and also the wire's surroundings and also the ground system. Odds are that most lengths are fine though, so the easiest solution is to pick a length based on something else (like, the room you have available) and if you get unlucky, roll the dice again.</p>

<p>Also, if the wire is too short, then it won't be a very effective radiator. If the wire is longer than half a wavelength, then making it longer doesn't make it any more effective. Making it shorter than half a wavelength doesn't suddenly stop making it working either, so if you don't have enough space to put up a full half-wavelength that's fine, too.</p>

<p>Fact is, if you can effectively couple RF current into something that's large relative to the wavelength and is a good conductor, you get an antenna. The bigger problem with end-fed antennas is subtle: it's actually only half the antenna. The ground is the other half, and I don't mean Earth. I mean whatever is attached to the other half of the feedline. If you are using a tuner that has just one wire coming out of it, then the other half is the tuner's chassis, and whatever is connected to it. If you are concerned about making a good antenna, my advice would be to <a href=""http://www.w8ji.com/long_wire_antenna.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">learn more about end-fed antennas work, and interact with ground</a>, before worrying about length.</p>

"How can I safely transmit without an antenna tuner or SWR meter?","9018","","<p>Just what the title says.</p>

<p>An <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antenna_tuner"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Antenna Tuner</a>, henceforth AT, is almost a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">de facto</a> piece of equipment in a shack; working the bands without one is tantamount to leaping off the diving board into a swimming pool with tarantula nests in it ... or worse.</p>

<p>The reason for the AT is primarily to match the antenna to the transmitter for the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_wave_ratio"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Standing Wave Ratio</a>. The greater the SWR, the more the risk to the transmitter. But before one uses an AT, one either designs the antenna (balanced/unbalanced, array-type, length, impedance ... and constructs it), or purchases the antenna.</p>

<p><strong>Keeping it simple</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Say, A simple mono-band centre-fed dipole is constructed after calculating the length for that band</li>
<li>Say further, neither an AT nor an SWR meter is available </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Given the above assumptions, what I would like to know</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>How can I transmit without an antenna tuner? </li>
<li>Are there any rule-of-thumb tests/calculations I may do to determine whether an antenna is a decent fit for a given band?</li>
</ul>

<p><em>As a corollary</em> </p>

<ul>
<li>What if the antenna is <strong>not</strong> a simple centre-fed mono-band antenna? </li>
<li>How did they tune antennas back when the hobby was still new? I guess <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/questions/383/does-a-tube-based-hf-transmitter-need-an-antenna-tuner"">Does a tube based HF transmitter need an antenna tuner?</a> may be relevant to this part of the question</li>
</ul>
","<p>The SWR meter helps you match the impedance of the radio to the antenna.  If the impedance is mismatched, you lose power.  If the impedance mismatch is large, you risk damaging your radio, particularly on the lower frequencies.</p>

<p>Tube based transmitters and amplifiers have more leeway for mismatch than semiconductor based amplifiers.</p>

<p>Lower power transmitters also have more leeway for mismatch before damage occurs.</p>

<p>The <em>ideal is to borrow an SWR meter and tune your antenna for the intended frequency, or send the antenna to someone who can do that for you.</em></p>

<p><strong>If you don't have any of these tools and can't get help from others easily, you can get as close to the right frequency by building the antenna according to the design, then start transmitting on low power and make contacts.  Find someone willing to work with you, and ask for signal quality reports. Then make a small adjustment to the antenna and ask for another report.</strong>  </p>

<p>It's a long process, but they will receive more signal the better your radio is matched to your antenna, so it's an easy check.</p>

<p>Do this at low power though, so you reduce the risk of damaging your transmitter.</p>

"How can I reduce the noise coming in from an RTL-SDR dongle?","7183","","<p>I've recently received an RTL-SDR dongle, and I'm picking up a lot of noise that is probably coming from my PC, especially a lot of ""spikes"" on the 2M band. I've already started using a USB extension cable instead of plugging the dongle into the PC. What else can I do to reduce the noise floor and get rid of the RFI on 2 meters?</p>
","<p>Here is an assortment of common ideas and recommendations for RTL-SDR devices:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Mount the device directly on your antenna, or otherwise minimize the amount of feed line used.</strong> (This does not directly remove noise but rather increases signal, but that's just as good if not better. It may also remove noise by moving the device further from your computer equipment.) Of course, if your antenna is outdoors you will need a weatherproof enclosure, and you must make sure the USB line meets USB specs despite its increased length (such as by using an <em>active extension cable</em> designed for the purpose).</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure you have the <strong>RF gain set correctly</strong>!</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Too little gain will bury real signals in the noise floor; turn it up until you see the noise floor rising a bit so that <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/a/905/76"">you're seeing the noise from the antenna</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Too much gain will overload and produce duplicated signals across the spectrum; turn it down until those extra spikes go away.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I have found that the built-in AGC may err in the direction of too much gain.</p></li>
<li><p>Build a <strong>shielded enclosure around the device</strong>; they come in plastic cases with no RF shielding at all.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Add <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrite_bead"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">snap-on ferrite beads</a></strong> near the ends of cables, if they didn't come with built-in ferrites.</p></li>
<li><p>An RTL-SDR-specific suggestion I have frequently heard is to modify a USB extension cable by removing the shield at the female-A end. (One could also modify the device's male-A plug but that might interfere with the mechanical connection.)</p>

<p>The argument given is that the ground and shield are tied together on the PCB, and by disconnecting the USB cable shield from the ground you prevent noise carried on the outside of the shield from entering the RF section's ground.</p>

<p>I have not yet tried this modification myself, and a few comments here suggest it is not worthwhile.</p></li>

"What bands and modes will give me voice at 3,000 miles?","7134","","<p>I pursued Amateur Radio primarily for local emergency communications and as part of my electronics education.  My only radio right now is an inexpensive 2m/70cm HT which is good for local weather spotting and emergency operations.</p>

<p>I'm interested in talking to other Amateur Radio users around the US, but I'm trying to keep my costs down.  I know that many amateurs can make contacts worldwide on various bands at very low power levels, but many of them require specific conditions.  I'd like to be able to talk with others around the US regardless of the conditions.</p>

<p>What bands and modes best suit these requirements, in order of importance:</p>

<ul>
<li>USA Amateur Radio bands</li>
<li>Voice contacts</li>
<li>Long distance (3,000 miles, 4,800km, or more)</li>
<li>Unconditional access (don't want to worry about time of day, minor weather effects, etc)</li>
<li>Low cost of setup (including antenna cost)</li>
<li>Low power usage</li>
<li>Small footprint (doesn't require acres of antennas)</li>
</ul>

<p>The first four are critical.  If there is no band or mode at any cost that fits these needs, then the question cannot be answered.  If multiple solutions exist for the first four, then narrow them down or rank them according to each of the next three requirements.  For instance a lower cost with a bigger antenna footprint would be preferable to a solution that cost more but had a smaller antenna footprint.</p>
","<p>You are going to have a very difficult time achieving the first 4 with any band on a low budget. But in general, I'll say a few words to get you started.</p>

<ol>
<li>You probably want to be able to use digital modes. Your best bet to get consistently across the country will be via digital modes, as they can add something like 20-30 dB effectively to your signal. Olivia in particular might be a good choice. This is achieved because digital modes are more sensitive, able to read signals below the noise floor.</li>
<li>If you want to be able to reach your ""neighborhood"" consistently, and occasionally around the world, then your best bet is probably 40 m. In fact, 40m is a highly recommended band to start out on. It works very reliably up to about 700 miles during the day, a bit further at night, and if you get it high enough, can work really well at night. Plus it's less crowded and generally more friendly than 20m.</li>
<li>20m is the best band overall to work around the world, but you often will have difficulties with things that are closer. </li>
<li>If you really want voice to anywhere in the world, you'll want a huge yagi antenna on a large tower, transmitting at the full legal power in a quiet RF area. Other than that, you will have some compromise.</li>
</ol>

<p>My set up is a G5RV in my attic, which I can talk routinely to Europe on 20m, most of the East part of North America on 40m, and occasionally further on 10 and 15m. I live in Virginia (FM19), to give you an idea.</p>

"How to determine antenna height for given HF frequency and coverage radius?","7111","","<p>I'm planning on setting up a low-HF antenna for near to mid-range contacts.</p>

<p>In my particular case, <em>ideally</em> I would like to be able to cover a radius of approximately 1000-1200 km with good reliability, operating on 3.5 MHz and possibly supplanted by 7 MHz. (Using a combination of the two bands to achieve full coverage is perfectly acceptable.) At a minimum, I want to be able to cover something like a 600-700 km radius. I'm at approximately 58°N, locator JO68; this of course means that I need to take into consideration large seasonal variations in ionosphere illumination.</p>

<p>Now, such coverage seems to me to be a nearly ideal fit for NVIS.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Given an antenna height above ground and operating frequency, how do I determine an approximate resultant coverage radius in the case of NVIS?</p></li>
<li><p>Or alternatively, given an operating frequency and desired coverage radius, how do I determine how high above ground the antenna needs to be?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I'm preferably looking for a (mathematical) answer that does not involve using antenna modeling software.</p>

<p>For simplicity's sake, let's just assume a straight half-wave dipole at an even height above perfect ground.</p>
","<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_Vertical_Incidence_Skywave"" rel=""nofollow"">Near Vertical Incidence Skywave (NVIS)</a> is already pretty well defined in both radius and antenna height by definition.  The antenna achieves best performance no more than 1/4 wavelength above the ground, and typically reaches receivers 50km-650km (30-400 miles) away.  It isn't going to help you out much with receivers 1000-2000km away.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there isn't a single, simple, good calculation for antenna height vs transmission distance, which is why so many antenna modeling packages exist.</p>

<p>You'll get line of sight at close distances, which uses one equation.</p>

<p>You can get groundwave propagation distances further out with another equation.</p>

<p>Skywave and NVIS propagation distances will get you even further which each have their own calculations.</p>

<p>An antenna modeling package takes into account all these various radiation modes, and can account for many other factors to bring you to a reasonable decision.  You might not want to use one, but they were actually created to make this problem simpler to solve.  Doing it by hand is more difficult, but can be rewarding if you want to learn more about propagation.</p>

<p>The simplest answer is that the ""ideal"" height for an antenna at these frequencies is 1/2 wavelength - but even there ""ideal"" depends on whether you want optimum ground reflection.  If you can't get your 3.5MHz antenna 140 feet in the air, though, then ""as high as you can"" is the ideal height.  Technically this is actually shifted up a little bit - <a href=""http://www.voacap.com/antennas/squeezing-decibels-out-of-dipole/"" rel=""nofollow"">the ideal height is 0.6 wavelengths above the ground, and every additional half wavelength thereafter</a> (1.1wl, 1.6wl, etc).</p>

I was just wondering how you determine the proper spacing between elements; is there any set formula you use to determine boom length, element spacing, etc. that you can use to design a yagi? If anyone can tell me, I would really appreciate it.</p>
","<p>It would be nice to think that there is simple formula or algorithm that one could plug the frequency and desired gain into, and out would come the required element spacings.</p>

<p>The reality is that the math is difficult - requiring the solution of many simultaneous equations - and the results may still not absolutely mirror reality due to variations in materials.</p>

<p>Most Yagi-Uda designs are based on empirical methods and often use pre-tested models such as those by the NIST and DL6WU.</p>

<p>The spacing of the reflector and the first director are usually the most critical. Multiple directors usually end up with around 0.4 wavelength spacing. Small amounts of improvement in gain can be obtained by playing with the spacing of the directors - however, it is generally not worth the effort.</p>

<p>What is a waterfall display? </p>
","<p>A waterfall display is a graphical representation of the signals across a frequency range, generally color-coded to indicate signal amplitude or strength, displayed over time.</p>

<p>Pictured in the image above is a number of signal traces. Since the above was taken across a frequency range where PSK31 is used, the signals are very narrow (only a few tens of Hz wide each), but it could easily cover a much larger frequency range ""zoomed out"" and still look basically the same. Here, black and dark blue is basically background noise, and bright white represents a very strong signal. We can also see that the station around 2450 Hz into the receiver passband appears to have insufficient sideband suppression (notice the additional, weaker signals centered on the main signal frequency).</p>

<p>Having an overview of all signals across a portion of the spectrum allows you to quickly and easily determine whether there are any strong signals, which usually indicates stations that would be easy for you to make contact with. Not having to scan across the band to locate any station that might happen to be transmitting at the exact moment you pass over its frequency but rather being able to locate stations transmitting while you are working another station, means that you can immediately jump to the frequency when you are done with the previous station.</p>

"What does a noise blanker really do, and what are the side effects?","5767","","<p>Most HF rigs have a <strong>noise blanker</strong> (NB) feature. It does reduce some types of noise (car ignition noise and such). How does it really work?</p>

<p>I've read it has negative side-effects with strong signals, which is why it is not enabled all the time.</p>
","<p>Some types of noise are very short bursts of energy. Car ignition noise is one example. Power-line noise caused by switching triacs in light dimmers is another. For example, see the top image here:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kdCJH.jpg"" alt=""pulse noise on a scope""></p>

<p>(<a href=""http://www.ka7oei.com/syn_blank.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">source: <em>A Line-Synchronous Noise Blanker</em> by KA7OEI</a>)</p>

<p>This image also illustrates the effect of band-pass filtering on these pulses. The middle image shows the effect of filtering the pulses through a SSB filter, and the bottom image through a narrower CW filter. Though the filters remove the higher harmonics of the pulses, they do this at the expense of introducing ringing and ""smearing"" the pulse over a longer time.</p>

<p>This is why noise blankers are desirable for this kind of noise: if you can chop out the noise in the time domain, just for those very brief pulses, without introducing the ringing that a bandpass filter would introduce. A noise blanker detects when these noise pulses occur, and then attenuates the receiver for the duration of the pulse.</p>

<p>The downside is that this has the potential to introduce more noise and distortion than it removes. Attenuating the signal for these brief periods is equivalent to multiplying the signal by a square wave which is usually 1 but is 0 for the brief periods where the attenuation is happening.</p>

<p>This can be viewed as a kind of amplitude modulation or mixing, and what you get at the output are frequency components that are the sum and the difference of the frequency components of the original signal, and the square wave from the noise blanker. The square wave, being very rich in harmonics, creates frequency components over a wide band. An analogous and more familiar phenomenon happens in CW: if the carrier is switched on or off too quickly we get ""key clicks"" or ""splatter"". In a noise blanker we aren't switching on and off a carrier, but rather whatever signal we might be receiving, but the mechanism by which noise is introduced is the same.</p>

<p>Thus, practical noise blankers filter the square wave, such as by limiting the slew rate of the attenuation or such. This reduces the harmonic content of that square wave, thus reducing the distortion introduced by the blanker. There's a trade-off to be made here: more filtering of the blanking square wave means it can't cut out the pulses with the same precision because it can't respond as quickly, so the trick is to adjust the response to remove as much as the pulse as possible, as little of everything else as possible, while introducing a minimum of distortion.</p>

<p>The main problem with strong signals is that it makes it more difficult to find the noise pulses. Recall from the image that if the signal is filtered, the pulses get smeared and the noise blanker becomes ineffective. Thus, the noise blanker is most effective where receive bandwidth is greatest: right at the antenna, and not behind any receive filters. However, if there are strong signals present anywhere, even not necessarily at the tuned frequency, then these signals contain peaks which can look, to the noise blanker, like noise.</p>

<p>Different kinds of noise blankers have different ways of deciding what peaks are ""noise"" and what are not, and may be more or less susceptible to being confused in a particular situation. There are many kinds of noise, and many kinds of band conditions, so there is no one noise blanker design that works in all situations. Thus, one will always want the ability to enable or disable the noise blanker.</p>

"How do I power my radio in a vehicle mobile install?","5649","","<p>I want to install a 30W mobile UHF radio in my car. I already have an antenna and mounting bracket - but how do I get power to this radio? It has an SAE bullet connector on the back - do I just need a cigarette lighter adapter, or do I have to wire it in somewhere else? Do I need a fuse?</p>
","<p>While many transceivers and scanners can be powered by a cigarette lighter adapter, you typically want to run at most one transceiver in this way, and should make absolutely certain that you know where that lighter is getting powered from. Most car fuseboxes are relatively easy to access, and most owners manuals will tell you what fuse is associated with each cigarette lighter - if the fuse is anything less than 10 Amps, do not use it. Absolutely do not change the fuse to something higher.</p>

<p>Some possible concerns include the fact that your radio will likely start drawing it's full current only occasionally, but suddenly. Intermittent current draws like that are less likely to pop fuses than constant draws, even if the current is greater than the fuse's rating. On the other hand, you may experience voltage drops when you key up due to the resistance in the wire between your radio and battery. In the worst case, your cigarette lighter may be wired for ""chassis ground return"", where that 10 amp current is not being returned through a copper ground wire, but through the car's steel chassis. This is OK for stuff like an AM/FM radio or the cabin lighting, but that same resistance equates to a higher voltage drop with your 10 amp radio, which can distort your output signal or even cause devices to sense an ""undervolt"" condition and shut down.</p>

<p>And as an added bonus, guess what else is connected to your vehicle chassis? Yep, that's right, your antenna ground! So now you may have three different actual grounds all connected together, but at different voltages because of the resistance in the chassis: Your power supply ground at the radio, your RF ground at the antenna, and the actual negative post of the battery. This situation can mess with the bias of your final RF amplifier causing signal distortion or overheating.</p>

<p>The best way, and the ways the pros do it, is to run a separate pair of wires from the battery to the radio. These wires must be rated for the maximum current draw of the radio (and then some, since every ham initially plans to install one radio and then winds up with 5) and both positive and negative leads must be fused at the battery. If they aren't, and come into contact with anything, you may short your car battery causing a fire. </p>

<p>There's another bonus of connecting directly to the battery - some cars shut off the cigarette lighter when the car is off, but if you connect straight to the battery, you have control over how the power is controlled. There are low voltage disconnects intended for this purpose which will detect when the car is turned off and shut off the radio a fixed amount of time later, but which can be overriden to allow you to operate the radio without turning on the car if needed.</p>

"Is an antenna analyzer necessary for building antennas?","5634","","<p>I'd like to try my hand at building a few antennas for VHF/UHF use.  I'm going to be going approximately from established designs, but obviously the final result will require some tuning.  I don't currently own either an SWR meter or antenna analyzer.  Is an SWR meter good enough for what I want to do, or will an antenna analyzer be necessary for this?  What are the benefits of an antenna analyzer in such situations?</p>
","<p>I've not personally built antennas from scratch, but I appreciate <a href=""http://www.rigexpert.com/index?s=aa1000"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">my antenna analyzer</a> just for being a good instrument — making the invisible aspects of my antenna system visible. </p>

<p>Compared to using a SWR meter for the purpose, an antenna analyzer:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Displays more information.</p>

<p>A SWR meter still gives you <em>enough</em> information, in the sense that you can try things until they move towards 1:1 SWR, but it's a one-dimensional measurement: if you tried to adjust an antenna using it you're doing a “hotter colder” search, trying things until it improves.</p>

<p>An antenna analyzer will tell you resistance and reactance independently, which allows you to more directly understand the problem. For example, you can have an exactly resonant antenna, which simply has the wrong magnitude of impedance (you need an impedance transformer). On a SWR meter this can show up as the SWR having a minimum point but remaining well above 1:1. (That minimum point <a href=""//ham.stackexchange.com/questions/2482/whats-the-difference-between-minimum-swr-and-resonance"">is not necessarily the resonant point</a>.) On an antenna analyzer, you can immediately see that you've got R = 34 Ω instead of 50 Ω (or whatever), and build that correction into your balun.</p>

<p>High-end antenna analyzers can also give you measurements at multiple frequencies — either as a graph or individual readings at selected frequencies. A graph allows you to easily obtain measurements in the opposite direction — not “how suitable is this antenna at this frequency?”, but “what frequencies is this antenna good for?”, as well as other RF-electronics measurements like finding the resonant frequency of a circuit or the upper frequency limit of a ferrite choke.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ALlnX.jpg"" alt=""""></p>

<p>In the above picture: my RigExpert AA-600 antenna analyzer displaying an impedance graph (it can also compute SWR from the same data). You can see directly from this graph that whatever it's connected to is resonant at the frequency at the middle of the graph (reactance crosses zero) and at that point has a resistance (and also magnitude of impedance) of 100 Ω.</p></li>
<li><p>Lets you use less transmitted power.</p>

<p>To measure the impedance of your antenna, no matter what instrument you use, you need a signal generator — a transmitter — somewhere. An antenna analyzer has a low-power signal generator built in.</p>

<p>If you use a SWR meter, you have to use a separate one; if you use your regular transceiver for the purpose, you're limited to its lowest power setting, which might be a few watts! Even if you have a lower power transmitter, it might not be sufficient to show a reading on the SWR meter, which has scales for much higher power levels.</p>

<p>By comparison, my antenna analyzer's output falls within FCC Part 15 emissions limits, so I'm much less likely to interfere with anyone else (and don't have to stop to identify myself, either).</p></li>

"Connect two receiving antennas to the same radio","5490","","<p>I have built a 1090 MHz ADS-B antenna roughly following <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkUYdCPFXXs"" rel=""nofollow"">some video instructions</a>. It appears to work reasonably.</p>

<p>However, because of how it is placed, it captures signals for more or less a half of the sky. So I would like to build another and put it on the other side of the house to receive from the other half. Is there some proper way to attach the two antennas to the same receiver (possibly connecting them via some impedance matcher or whatever is needed)? Or do I really need to put two receivers in operation?</p>

<p>(beside the practical answer itself, I am also curious of the explanations)</p>
","<p>Yes, you can do this. There are two issues: connecting it to the radio, and the effect on reception. The latter might be problematic enough that using two receivers is actually a better option.</p>

<h3>Connecting two antennas to the radio</h3>

<p>If you simply connect two antennas in parallel, the math is just like connecting two resistors in parallel: the impedance is halved. This is in principle a problem, because there will be losses due to the mismatch reflecting some received power.</p>

<p>The “correct” thing to do is use a <em>power combiner</em> (a.k.a. power divider (when used in the other direction) or “splitter” in TV-cable-land). This device has three ports with equal impedances, one of which goes to your receiver and the others go to the two antennas. Since you're using 75 Ω TV coax for your antenna, you might as well get one sold for TV/cable/satellite use.</p>

<p>However, not using one might not matter much, or might even improve things, because there's a very good chance that your antenna is not actually well matched to your receiver already (because your antenna's resonant frequency is not 1090 MHz, or the antenna has a resistive impedance not equal to the receiver's or coax's impedance). I recommend trying things and seeing what happens. Or if you have access to an antenna analyzer, start measuring.</p>

<h3>Effect on reception (radiation pattern)</h3>

<p>What you're doing is building an <em>array antenna</em>. When the signals from the two antennas meet, the waves are summed, and this means there can be either constructive or destructive interference (stronger or weaker resulting signal). Which one you get depends on the <em>phase</em> of the signals.</p>

<p>If your antennas literally saw exactly half the sky, then there would be no problem. But in practice, they will overlap in coverage — a transmitter (aircraft) can be in the view of both antennas at once. In this case, if the signals from both antennas are <em>in phase</em>, you will receive a good signal; if they are <em>out of phase</em> (more or less), you will receive a weaker signal than if you had only one of the two antennas.</p>

<p>In order to make sure the signals are in phase in this case, the coax from the two antennas to the combiner must be of equal length, plus or minus complete wavelengths. A wavelength at 1090 MHz is 27.5 cm; but this must be adjusted for the velocity factor of the coax, so the easiest thing is to use identical lengths.</p>

<p>If you were building a array antenna in free space, then the antenna will have a highly uneven pattern with many nulls (directions of almost no reception), as the varying distance to the two antennas from the transmitter changes the phase, but insofar as your house blocks the signal from arriving at more than one antenna at a time it will cause a more uniform pattern.</p>

<p>You can in principle use antenna modeling software to determine the pattern to expect and adjust it to be omnidirectional, but it would be very, very hard to create a sufficiently accurate model of your house.</p>

<h3>Using two receivers</h3>

<p>If you're using RTL-SDR dongles or similarly cheap receivers, using two receivers is <strong>highly likely to be a better option</strong>. Using two receivers:</p>

<ul>
<li>avoids the possibility of the two antennas canceling each other out.</li>
<li>avoids signal loss from the length of coax needed to cross your house (coax which has low loss at 1 GHz is expensive and bulky).</li>
</ul>

<p>The disadvantage of separate receivers (besides needing software to combine the data streams in this particular application) is that if the transmitter <em>is</em> in sight of both antennas, you don't get the SNR benefit from receiving a stronger combined signal.</p>

"FCC tracking of unlicensed FRS/GMRS transmissions","5425","","<p>If a transceiver such as the BaoFeng UV-5R is used to transmit over FRS/GMRS frequencies (unlicensed), it is illegal in the United States due to FCC regulations that state that the power must be &lt;0.5W and that the radio must not have a detachable antenna (the UV-5R is rated up to 5W and has a detachable antenna). Realistically, though, I am wondering if and how the FCC actually enforces this? </p>

<p>For instance, if two people decided to use these as high power ""walkie talkies"", and were careful to select unused frequencies, didn't disrupt other peoples' communications, didn't communicate from home/work (i.e. a static location that identified the person transmitting), and changed frequencies regularly, my questions are:</p>

<p>1) I understand the law, but is it actually enforced? Do they even waste resources trying to catch people doing this if there is no disruption occuring? Are there any documented cases of the FCC actually tracking down and harassing/fining/jailing people for illegal FRS/GMRS transmissions of this sort? </p>

<p>2) How would the FCC actually track down this sort of sporadic, non-disruptive transmission from multiple locations? I understand the concept of triangulation of radio signals, but how is this actually achieved on a nationwide scale and in a way that can promptly lead them to the location of the transmission (so that they can fine/arrest someone)? Are there passive monitoring systems in place in urban areas that can automatically/instantly detect illegal transmissions? Black helicopters with FCC agents flying around hunting for illegal walkie-talkie usage? etc :) What does their tracking technology actually look like nowadays, and what kind of capabilities does it have that would enable tracking this type of transmission?</p>

<p>3) Are there any sorts of identifying signals (some sort of unique identifier) that handheld transceivers such as these emit while transmitting, that allow for the instant identification of the device? (i.e. something akin to an IMEI # for cell phones)</p>

<p>You can browse the Enforcement Bureau's Field Notices at <a href=""http://transition.fcc.gov/eb/FieldNotices/"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://transition.fcc.gov/eb/FieldNotices/</a>. I did find a few related to FRS violations, e.g. several cases where a company (or even a township water authority!) was using FRS/GMRS for business purposes — even going so far as to set up repeaters.</p>

<p>I didn't find a case of enforcement against simply an individual casually using an unlicensed walkie-talkie in an otherwise non-interfering manner. However, if the FCC truly ""didn't care"" they would change their rules to reflect that.</p>

<p>Instead, they have recently (May 26, 2016) issued <a href=""http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2016/db0526/DA-16-588A1.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">a Public Notice</a> warning that ""Persons or Businesses Using Authorized Equipment

Are Subject to Enforcement Action"". They don't single out ""use an uncertified ham handheld on FRS?"" in their examples — and in fact they mostly seem to be targeting the use of ""authorized equipment"" in <em>un</em>authorized ways — but it's clear that at least some attention is being paid to the use of ""unlicensed"" (more properly, ""licensed by rule"") spectrum.</p>

<p>The ARRL for their part, want you to think of the the FCC's notice as applicable in this case. In <a href=""http://www.arrl.org/news/fcc-warns-that-use-of-authorized-equipment-must-comply-with-all-laws-and-rules"" rel=""noreferrer"">their news item covering the notice</a> they add this as their own example: ""using an Amateur Radio transceiver on the Family Radio Service.""</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How would the FCC actually track down this sort of sporadic, non-disruptive transmission from multiple locations? […] Are there passive monitoring systems in place in urban areas that can automatically/instantly detect illegal transmissions? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of the <a href=""https://www.fcc.gov/general/enforcement-primer"" rel=""noreferrer"">NAL</a> documents I've seen are in response to <strong>complaints</strong>. Even the aforementioned public notice doesn't talk about agency resources being bulked up or anything, but merely ""If you have reason to believe that radio frequency equipment is being used […] in a manner that violates the Commission’s rules or the Communications Act, you can file a complaint with the FCC.""</p>

<p>The liability letters also provide insight not just into <em>why</em> enforcement action was taken, but how enforcement is done. For example, <a href=""https://transition.fcc.gov/eb/FieldNotices/2003/DOC-290813A1.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">when a GMRS licensee was maliciously interfering with a LMRS licensee</a>, one of the transmitting antennas involved was tracked down ""using a mobile direction finding ('MDF') vehicle"" — i.e. they had to send an agent out driving around to find the perp. Perhaps this is merely <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_construction"" rel=""noreferrer"">parallel construction</a>, but taking their word for it, means enforcement is not cheap.</p>

<p>The FCC does have a <a href=""https://www.fcc.gov/general/high-frequency-direction-finding-center"" rel=""noreferrer"">High Frequency Direction Finding Center</a> which is apparently <a href=""http://www.arrl.org/news/fcc-releases-warning-notices-to-several-radio-amateurs"" rel=""noreferrer"">fairly precise</a> — whether this is true or primarily a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_licensing_in_the_United_Kingdom#TV_detector_vans"" rel=""noreferrer"">Television detector van</a>-type ruse to keep us honest I couldn't tell you. (It's certainly more plausible in the case of an intentional radiation.)</p>

<p>Of course, due to much more limited UHF propagation you would need a lot more listening stations to address this sort of problem. Perhaps there is public information on this, perhaps there is inter-agency involvement NOT part of the public record (the HFDFC is part of a ""Homeland Security"" bureau…) — whether the feds are as interested in non-hams out hiking with Baofengs, as they are in tracking the cellphones of everyone attending a political protest… your guess is as good as mine…</p>

<p>I'd like to know the RMS value of the voltage on my antenna. When measured with my multimeter, it shows it's beyond 600V~ RMS. When I measure just before my last inductors I have about 350V~ RMS. </p>

<p>I have a scope which goes up to 400V peak-to-peak on the screen (I'm not sure about its maximum ratings), but I'm reluctant to try, because I'm not sure if the measurements of my multimeter are correct, and I wouldn't like to damage my scope.</p>

<p>So: is it likely that a simple, common multimeter can measure RF voltages? I've seen <a href=""http://jdtechsales.com/measure-rf-voltages-with-a-multimeter/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this circuit</a> which suggests that it's not possible and you have to put something in between the RF  and the multimeter:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3CeU4.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>However, they're rectifying the RF voltage, so they in fact measure with the DC input. My multimeter has an AC input - it's unclear to me if a circuit as this one is still needed in that case.</p>
","<p>For an ideal meter, sure, it's possible. However, most multimeters are not designed to work at RF. There are all sorts of problems: what effect does the input capacitance have on the measurement? What's the characteristic impedance of the leads? Most multimeters don't take these things into account because the only AC voltage they are designed to measure is 60 or 50Hz.</p>

<p>The rectifying circuit in your question is a good solution. Note that you don't really need to use coaxial cable: since the output is DC, it hardly matters what kind of cable you use. The ""cable"" might just be the leads of your multimeter. You can also stick a sensitive analog meter (something on the order of microamps) directly on a circuit like this and get a decent RF detector.</p>

<p>With an ideal rectifier, what you will measure with the meter (set to DC) is the peak-to-peak voltage of the RF input. Of course, no matter what diode you use, it will be anything but ideal at RF. There is at least the forward voltage drop of the diode to take into account (which can be reduced by using a Schottky or germanium diode). Real diodes also have capacitance, and all the components are going to have some inductances, and these reactances are going to filter the input signal in a way which may or may not be significant for your frequency of interest. However, if all you care about is a qualitative measurement of the input, a simple diode rectifier is quite sufficient.</p>

<p>It's also worth mentioning because it's not always obvious, but if you have a receiver, that can make a valuable piece of test equipment. A cheap SDR (like the SoftRock kits) coupled with the audio card of a computer makes a pretty decent RF frequency analyzer. If you also have an RF signal generator of known power (check eBay), then you can also calibrate your test equipment to give quantitative measurements.</p>

"Noise bridge use in antenna construction?","4589","","<p>How does a noise bridge work?  And how can a noise bridge be useful in building, testing, and/or tuning an antenna?</p>
","<p>A Noise Bridge is a very useful piece of test kit, often described as a ""poor man's antenna analyzer"".  It's capable of measuring the exact impedance of an antenna, both the resistive and reactive components, something that normally requires a pricey bit of lab equipment.</p>

<p>Unlike an SWR meter, the noise bridge, requires little or no transmitted power applied to the antenna. The SWR meter works by measuring the reflected wave from the antenna back to the transmitter when a transmission is made. But a noise bridge measures the impedance directly allowing an accurate antenna tuning to occur without transmitting, so there is no risk of transmitter damage or QRM on the bands.</p>

<p>So, how does it work?  The bridge has four legs, one is a reference impedance (usually a calibrated variable resistor and a calibrated variable capacitor in series) and the other leg is the unknown impedance to be measured (say, an antenna).  A white noise generator injects noise into the circuit that can be monitored by an HF receiver.  Then, the circuit is tuned until a null is detected in the receiver, the impedances are now matched and the circuit is in balance. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DTFue.png"" alt=""Noise Bridge Block Diagram""></p>

<p>A schematic look at the bridge:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QXf1P.png"" alt=""Noise Bridge Schematic""></p>

<p>Pretty nifty, but there are some other things you can do with them:</p>

<p><strong>Trap dipoles:</strong> The noise bridge will give a null on each band that the trap dipole resonates. Start with the highest frequency band and measure impedance and reactance as for a normal dipole. Adjust your antenna center section to resonance then repeat on the next lower band and so on. This method can be used on both horizontal and vertical trap antennas.</p>

<p><strong>Beam antenna:</strong> Connect the noise bridge to the driven element. Tune your receiver to the operating frequency and read the impedance and reactance. Adjust the element length to bring to resonance.</p>

<p><strong>Testing Baluns:</strong> You can't test a Balun or Unun with a VM because they usually have some or all of their legs tied off at DC, so it will read a dead short.  Instead, connect your noise bridge to the coax input of the balun. If its a 1:1 balun place a 50 ohm resistor across the output connectors. Now turn on the noise bridge and adjust for a noise null. You should see an impedance of close to 50 ohms and reactance of almost 0.</p>

<p><strong>Tuning the Antenna Tuner:</strong> You can set your antenna tuner without using your transmitter.  Connect the noise bridge to the transmitter side of the tuner and set the noise bridge controls for X=0 and R=50 and then adjust the tuner for null.  Don't leave the noise bridge in place, you'll probably smoke it if you transmit into it.</p>

<p>There are other less common, more technical uses such as determining the inductance of unknown ferrite material, pruning feedlines, etc.  Google is your friend here, it's a great piece of test gear to have around and very cheap to build if you don't want to drop $20 or so on a used Palomar R-X or old HeathKit 1422A.</p>

"What's wrong with 220MHz?","4536","","<p>It seems like 220MHz is the bastard step-child of the amateur world. Every HT is either 2m or 2m/70cm.  Some companies offer tri-banders, but they almost always add 6m (?!), not 220MHz.</p>

<p>The only way to get this band easily is the Chinese radios. I have a BAOFENG UV-5RC which is 2m/220MHz, and I have seen for sale single band 220 MHz mobile unit from TYT.</p>

<p>In an otherwise competitive market, it seems odd to me that none of the major makers have 220 in their lineup.  Why?</p>
","<p>While for an authoritative answer to this I believe you'd have to ask the manufacturers directly (unless we happen to have someone here on the site who works for one of them), there is a pretty big <em>plausible</em> reason why so few multiband radios include 220 MHz capability.</p>

<p><strong>The band is allocated to amateur radio mostly in the United States and Canada.</strong> (Source: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1.25-meter_band#Countries_with_known_allocations"">Wikipedia</a>.) Outside of ITU Region 2, the <em>only</em> country listed as having an allocation there is Somalia. On the other hand, with minor differences in frequency ranges for which it is trivial to implement restrictions in software only, two meters and 70 cm are both allocated to amateur radio practically worldwide.</p>

<p>Since 220 MHz also is not harmonically related to the band pair two meters and 70 cm, adding it to an existing design would probably require a fairly significant outlay in new electronics, filters etc. You would, at the very least, need to fix up the receiver so it performs well on the band, add the ability to tune the VFO to the band (assuming you don't already have a wide coverage VFO) and add a proper band pass filter to filter the transmitted signal. Other steps might be needed as well depending on the particular transceiver design. There is also the related problem that a 2m/70cm antenna is not resonant at 1.25 meters, which increases the risk of damage due to mistakenly transmitting into an unmatched load.</p>

<p>It would seem that manufacturers don't consider the demand for 220 MHz capability to outweigh the cost of such design changes for a relatively limited market. The conclusion we can draw from this line of reasoning is that the reason why none of the major manufacturers include a multiband HT with 220 MHz capability in their lineup is precisely <em>because</em> it is a competitive market.</p>

"What makes a 5/8 wavelength vertical desirable?","4513","","<p>An ordinary 1/4 wavelength vertical is smaller and resonant without any loading coil or matching network. What's the advantage to a 5/8 wavelength vertical? Why 5/8 in particular, and not something longer or shorter?</p>
","<p>Indeed, why?  A 5/8λ isn't resonant where a 1/4λ or 1/2λ would be.  </p>

<p>The reason is the radiation pattern.  The pattern for a 1/4λ monopole is essentially a doughnut, tasty and a pretty good pattern especially for a VHF antenna. Extending the antenna changes the current distribution.  This flattens out the pattern removing power from the useless (for VHF purposes) vertical dimension and giving more horizontal gain and at a lower angle.  See the following illustration from the late great L. Cebik:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/oJZ2v.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Depending on the source, they will quote anywhere from 1.2dB to 3.5dB gain over the 1/2λ design.  There has also been some discussion that in some areas (urban and mountainous terrain) the lower angle of radiation is a detriment and a standard 1/4λ or 1/2λ antenna is to be favored.  I don't know. I guess they are pretty cheap, if this is a concern you can buy one mount and two and antenna, compare them for a bit and return the loser.</p>

<p>So, why 5/8λ?  Why not long longer? After all more gain is better right?  Well, inspecting the figure above you will notice the appearance of high angle lobes.  As you lengthen the antenna past 5/8λ these lobes become more pronounced and break up the pattern in undesirable ways. Making it shorter maintains a good pattern, but the gain is less.  So, 5/8λ is about optimal for this style of antenna.  </p>

"SDR: Quadrature demodulation vs direct RF sampling","4508","","<p>I see that many SDRs use a quadrature demodulator and sample I and Q signals. </p>

<p>But is it possible to downconvert the RF signal instead, sample it with only one ADC, and get the same capabilities of digital postprocessing?</p>

<p>So if we want to observe 100-150 MHz bandwidth: we pass it through a 100-150 MHz bandpass filter, downconvert it to DC-50 MHz, and sample it with a 100 MHz ADC.</p>

<p>Will it work? And if it will - why is IQ so widely used?</p>
","<p>Sure, it would work. In fact, if you've ever used something implementing some digital mode that interfaces with an SSB tranciever, this is exactly what is happening. Many TNCs and most PSK-31 software is an example of this.</p>

<p>The reason I/Q is more frequently used is that it's simpler. If you want an SDR with 50 MHz bandwidth, you can do that with a single 100 MHz ADC as you describe, or two 50 MHz ADCs and I/Q sampling. Either way, it's 100 million samples per second, so the ADC complexity is essentially the same.</p>

<p>The difference is in the mixing. An ordinary mixer works by multiplying two signals. This creates two sidebands, the sum and the difference of the frequency components of the two mixer inputs. One of these sidebands must then be filtered out. Good filters are hard to realize, digital or analog.</p>

<p>However, if you have the signal in I/Q form, the signal can be multiplied by a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_formula"">complex exponential</a>. This doesn't create sidebands: it directly shifts all the frequencies up or down by some frequency. This is more directly what we usually want to accomplish with a mixer.</p>

<p>There are additional benefits: the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform"">discrete Fourier transform</a> (DFT), used in a great many DSP techniques, works on complex numbers. When we don't have I/Q data to provide it, then we must arbitrarily set Q to something (usually 0). As a result, half the result of the DFT (all the negative frequencies) are just a mirror of the positive frequencies, so they are discarded. This is computationally inefficient.</p>

<p>I've wondered this for a while, sometimes I want a wide band antenna just for listening, and I am not clear about this relationship.</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>If an antenna analyzer shows 1:1, does that mean it's an ideal receiver as well?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>No.</strong></p>

<p>Assuming we're talking about a characteristic impedance of 50 ohms, a 50 ohm resistor (otherwise known as a dummy load) will show a SWR of 1:1, although it will almost certainly perform very poorly as either a receive or transmit antenna.</p>

<p>The low SWR simply tells you that there are no impedance mismatches along the path from the transmitter (antenna analyzer in the case of your question) to the antenna feedpoint, at the current operating frequency.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And what about the converse, will a well performing receive antenna show a 1:1 SWR?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Yes and no.</strong></p>

<p><em>Yes,</em> a SWR of 1:1 means that <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/q/55/29"">you aren't losing signal to impedance mismatch reflections</a>.</p>

<p><em>No,</em> another issue is how efficient the antenna is at picking up the (desired) signal, preferably (especially in the case of directional antennas) while rejecting undesired signals as well. An antenna that is 5% of a full half-length dipole isn't going to pick up as much RF as the full-length dipole, let alone a full-sized directional antenna pointed in the proper direction, simply due to the much smaller physical (antenna aperture) size.</p>

<p><strong>Generally speaking,</strong> if an antenna analyzer or (other) transmitter shows that the antenna output presents a SWR of 1:1, then <em>what you have</em> is probably about as good as it gets. <em>That does not necessarily mean that what you have is a good antenna setup</em> as exemplified by the extreme example of a dummy load.</p>

"Why do I need to tune an antenna?","3982","","<p>I've heard that when an antenna is set up, it needs to be tuned to reduce reflective power back into the radio. Is this always necessary, and if so how would I go about tuning it?</p>
","<p>There are two different parts to antenna tuning: <strong>transmission line impedance matching</strong> and <strong>resonance</strong>.</p>

<p>The antenna is at <em>resonance</em> when it presents a purely resistive load to the transmitter. That is, the reactive component of the load is 0: there exists no inductance or capacitance in the load.</p>

<p>However, <em>resonance says nothing about the value of the resistive component of the load</em>. Usually, you also want to reduce the impedance mismatch, because an impedance mismatch causes power to be reflected at the point of the mismatch. Most amateur radio equipment is built to expect a resistive load of 50 ohm impedance, which is the characteristic impedance of most coaxial cables used in radio applications.</p>

<p>An <em>antenna tuner</em> or ATU doesn't actually tune the antenna; it provides a matching network. On one side the transmitter sees a nice, orderly, purely resistive 50 ohms. On the other side is an unwieldy antenna, the impedance of which at the given frequency can be anything from purely resistive at 50 ohms to some odd-ball combination of weird resistance and either inductance or capacitance.</p>

<p>This is done by introducing either capacitance or inductance into the feedline, to cancel out the corresponding part of the load impedance. For a fixed antenna installation on a single frequency, you can even determine appropriate component values and use fixed-value components to make up such a matching network, but that lends itself poorly to the applications in which one wants to move frequencies, antennas and so on. <em>As a matter of fact, that is the approach taken by many electrically short antennas</em> and it comes at the cost of reduced antenna bandwidth (because the fixed matching network can only compensate, with an acceptable SWR, within a limited range of frequencies).</p>

<p><em>The SWR</em> or Standing Wave Ratio is related to the (mis)match in impedance. This means that your perfectly resonant antenna which happens to present a nice, clean, purely resistive 150 ohms (pulling a number out of thin air here) at the feedpoint and at a given frequency will give you a 3:1 SWR against 50 ohm coax, <em>despite being at resonance.</em></p>

<p>Also, even with an ATU, it's important to remember that the reflected power must go somewhere, and in this case, at least some of it is being dissipated as heat rather than radiated as RF. While you aren't likely to do much harm with some reflected power from an over-the-counter 100W transceiver, this can be a serious consideration if you are running a high-powered transmitter and/or a large amplifier.</p>

"How can I protect equipment against a lightning strike?","3901","","<p>A lot of aerials (almost by design) would be rather good attractors of lightning. What steps do I need to take in the field to keep my gear safe against a lightning strike?</p>

<p>I'm presuming the obvious already here (such as not operating in a storm), but are there any additional steps I should take?</p>
","<p>There's a lot that can be said about lightning protection, but it usually boils down to doing <em>all</em> of these things:</p>

<ol>
<li>make good, low impedance connections to Earth</li>
<li>bond all Earth connections together with a low impedance path</li>
<li>have only a <em>single</em> point of entry to protected equipment</li>
</ol>

<p>A real problem when discussing lightning protection is that people will consider only some of these things, and the result is sometimes worse than doing nothing.</p>

<h3>make good, low impedance connections to Earth</h3>

<p>Just about everyone understands this one. You want long rods in the ground, at least 8 feet. Multiple rods, if you can, about as far apart as they are deep. Lightning currents from a big direct strike can be in excess of 100,000 amperes, so you need <em>fat</em> conductors so they aren't vaporized by the current. Lighting is also an extremely fast pulse, which means it contains a lot of high-frequency energy, and you should think about it like RF current. Wide strapping is better than round conductors (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_effect"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">skin effect</a>) and you should make the path of your conductor as straight and short as possible to minimize resistance and inductance.</p>

<h3>bond all Earth connections together with a low impedance path</h3>

<p>This one is frequently neglected. The current from a strike is so huge that it won't simply all go into the closest grounding rod can find. The Earth itself isn't a low impedance conductor, so even when lightning strikes a point in an empty field, significant voltage gradients can be observed significant distances away from the strike point.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.w8ji.com/lightning_strikes.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">W8JI</a> has a great example of this, where a tree was struck, and some 20 feet away, arced back out of the ground to travel through a Beverage antenna.</p>

<p>Consequently, if you have multiple connections to Earth, or even things <em>close</em> to Earth, lightning currents <em>will</em> find a way to those points, even if that means flowing through your station equipment, arcing across water pipes, HVAC ducting, or even through wood or concrete in your home, which aren't great insulators. Bonding all the grounds together with heavy wire gives the current an intentional place to go.</p>

<p>Most building and fire codes <em>require</em> that all grounds are bonded with very heavy wire or strap, for this reason.</p>

<h3>have only a <em>single</em> point of entry to protected equipment</h3>

<p>Perhaps the most neglected point of all. If there are multiple points of entry, that means lightning current can enter at one point, and exit at another. As discussed in the previous point, lightning currents are so huge that they make significant voltage gradients almost everywhere, including between the two points of entry to your station. Where there are voltage gradients, there are currents, and where there are currents, things break.</p>

<p>A very common situation in amateur stations is to have a grounding rod at the mast or tower, where the feedline enters the shack, or both. <a href=""http://www.w8ji.com/images/Lightning/lightningpwrlines.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">W8JI provides a great diagram</a> of a <strong>poor</strong> grounding system: </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IgqBh.jpg"" alt=""poor station ground configuration""></p>

<p>(I highly recommend reading through the rest of W8JI's lightning and grounding information. Lots of diagrams, pictures, and good advice. On this topic: <a href=""http://www.w8ji.com/ground_systems.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ground systems</a>, <a href=""http://www.w8ji.com/house_ground_layouts.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">House ground layouts</a>, and <a href=""http://www.w8ji.com/second_floor_grounding.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Second floor grounding</a>.)</p>

<p>When lightning strikes the power lines, some of this current will go to ground through the additional ground(s) at the tower or shack entrance. After passing through your equipment and frying it, of course. Strikes on the tower cause the same problem, in the other direction. This is a situation where a naïve attempt at protection has made things worse, virtually <em>guaranteeing</em> equipment damage when a strike occurs. Even a nearby strike might introduce enough of a voltage between the grounds to cook your equipment.</p>

<p>Worse, in some setups, disconnecting the feedline leaves this extra ground (B) still connected, violating the popular ""wisdom"" that disconnecting the feedline in a storm protects your equipment!</p>

<hr>

<p>So what can you do?</p>

<h3>the ideal approach</h3>

<p>Ground the base of your tower or mast with a large field of radials and a lot of ground rods, spaced over a wide area, bonded together with wide copper strap. Bond the shields of all coax feedlines to this.</p>

<p>Surround your entire house in wide copper strap, with a hefty ground rod every eight feet or so.</p>

<p>Bond these two ground systems together with wide copper strap, so that any current caused by a voltage between them favors that strap over your feedlines. Make sure any utility grounds (electric, telco, etc) are also part of this system of grounds.</p>

<p><em>Every</em> cable that enters your shack, including the mains wiring, any control lines up the tower for rotators and such, ethernet cables for a home network, <em>everything</em>, enters the shack through a big, fat copper plate that's connected with a wide, short, straight connection to the ground running around the house. Each of these cables go through protection devices such as gas discharge tubes or MOVs. Conductors that should be grounded (feedline shields, AC safety ground, etc) are bolted directly to the grounding panel.</p>

<p>With a setup like this, you can confidently leave your feedlines connected in a storm, and survive direct strikes to the antennas. In fact, your house is probably <em>less</em> likely to be damaged by lighting than ordinary residential construction. A direct strike may cause some damage to exterior components, burning insulation or melting thin-gauge wires, but equipment inside is quite safe.</p>

<h3>more modest approach</h3>

<p>Most people will not want to invest the time or money to install a protection scheme that extensive. If you don't have a tall tower, or you live in an area where lightning is not frequent, it may be difficult to justify such expenditures.</p>

<p>In this case, it's better to think about what you <em>shouldn't</em> do. Don't create an extra ground. It's better to address <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/q/1271/218"">common-mode currents</a> with <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/q/538/218"">baluns</a> and proper antenna design. If you must have a ground (such as a vertical installed at ground level), then consider the ground part of the antenna, not the station, and be sure to disconnect it in storm conditions.</p>

<p>I live in an area where lightning is rare, but not unheard of. Should I drive ground rods into the ground for antenna/RF grounding? The antenna itself has several small ground radials, so I'm assuming that a good ground will aid performance, but don't know if using the existing building ground is ""good enough"". </p>

<p>I live in a multi-unit building which may complicate this since my understanding is that any antenna ground system should be bonded to the building ground to prevent differing ground potentials (and the bonding should be via a dedicated ground wire directly to the building ground, not through a ground conductor in the building wiring), however my building ground rod is in a separate structure. The service entrance is in a closet in the back of a garage structure, then it goes under  a sidewalk and my front yard and then into a service panel in my kitchen in the middle of the house (either under or through the cement slab). There's no apparent grounding electrode for the living unit, and even if there was, there's no  easy way to run a ground wire from the antenna to it since I'd either have to go around a neighbor's unit or over the roof to reach it. It is possible that the service panel is grounded to the slab rebar or to a ground electrode that's not visible. </p>

<p>My housing complex looks something like the diagram below (though there are more housing units than what I've drawn), where I'm in unit 2 and would mount the antenna outside a room on the back side of the unit, while the  service entrance comes in from the garage on the other side, The ""V"" shows the location of the service panel inside the unit:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VP626.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Since I'll be using it with a 12VDC mobile transceiver, I could conceivably keep the tranceiver isolated from ground, leaving the antenna &amp; transceiver ground completely separate from the building ground, but that seems quite unsafe if there is a difference in ground  potential between the back yard and front yard.</p>

<p>What is the best practice for grounding this antenna?</p>
","<blockquote>

<p>If the lightning hits the antenna, have the same problem in the other direction. The important thing to realize is that the current from a lightning strike is so huge that it will go through <em>all</em> the grounds, and if one of those paths is through your equipment, expect something to be broken.</p>

<p>You might even be making things worse by adding a ground (<em>B</em>) to your station. Now your radio is part of the safety ground for your house's electrical system, <em>even if you disconnect the feedline (A)</em>. Don't do that!</p>

<p>Grounding the antenna won't improve its performance. The important thing is to eliminate <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/q/1271/218"">common-mode currents</a> in your antenna system, perhaps <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/q/538/218"">with a balun</a>. Once you've done that, there won't be any need to ground the antenna for performance.</p>

<p>A proper lightning protection scheme requires that you take <em>all</em> cables entering your station, including the feedline, AC mains, ethernet, telephone, and anything else, and passing them through a common ground point which is bonded <em>really well</em> with the Earth (read: multiple ground rods, wide, short copper strap). With only one ground connection, there's no path <em>through</em> your equipment, only <em>around</em> it.</p>

<p>This is costly and time consuming, and given your specific situation (relatively small VHF antenna on what I assume isn't an especially large tower, in a region with rare lightning) it may be difficult to justify the expense and effort.</p>

<p>If you don't add more grounds (such as <em>B</em> in the diagram above), then you can be reasonably protected by <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/q/1451/218"">disconnecting the feedline</a>.

<p>In the computer adjacent to my ham station, I have had lockups but the network does not drop.  It is not wifi related.  I assume the lockups are from RF entering on a supposedly shielded cable like a USB mouse or keyboard cable.  It happens rarely now that RF-blocking clip on toroids are on the shields of these cables.</p>

<p>Interference from a D-Link to the HF radio receiver was only partially reduced by wrapping the D-Link in Alumnium foil (except for the antenna, of course) and adding toroids to the ethernet and power lines.  Routers can be noisy and some comparison shopping or additional internet questions may be in order.    </p>

<p><strong>Yes</strong> Any large metal object around your house, an antenna, a refrigerator, a metal table, your car in the garage, metal such as steel studs in the walls or floors ... will reflect the microwaves from your wifi.  The level of wifi signal at a particular spot is affected by these reflections. This doesn't have anything to do with talking on the ham radio, we are just talking about microwave reflections off of passive metal objects.</p>

<p>As far as talking on the ham radio goes, the frequency for Wifi is 2.4Ghz or 5Ghz, which is quite different from the frequencies for most ham radio 1.8 - 432 Mhz.  So they don't typically interfere.  Also, interference temporarily slows down Wifi, it doesn't typically stop wifi unless somehow the router stops operating. The transmission protocol of Wifi immediately resends information that was missed due to any reason (weak signal, interference from neighbors' wifi, etc) without action by the user.</p>

<p>If you have ancient 1980s era 49 Mhz cordless phones or 49 Mhz baby monitors, get rid of those.   Some amplified speakers -- like computer speakers -- may receive you when you talk.  This does not indicate any fault, and is normal.  It is the speakers that are the problem. </p>

<p>If you share your living situation with apartment neighbors or a home with a family or significant other, perception can be more important than fact. Perhaps strengthen the wifi first, and then worry about ham radio.</p>

<p>That being said, a variety of wifi routers and wifi antennas can be had for around 100 US dollars, and often less, that, by trial and error, might improve your existing signal levels.  The typical $30 wifi router does not have a very powerful transmitter and you might pay attention to the output power (usually in milliwatts) if you upgrade it.</p>

<p>Some people build focused wifi antennas out of <a href=""http://www.turnpoint.net/wireless/has.html#what"">various food cans</a> or <a href=""http://www.mikestechblog.com/joomla/networking-section/wifi-wireless-category/58-extend-wireless-wifi-network-building-24-ghz-cantenna.html"">flashlights</a> to obtain a gain in signal.

"How is the IF for a superhet selected?","3285","","<p>There seem to be almost as many choices for the intermediate frequency (IF) as there are superheterodyne receivers and transceivers out there. The ones I have come across are 455 kHz, 452 kHz, 1.6 MHz and 6 MHz.</p>

<p>What would be the rationale for choosing a particular IF for a superhet?</p>
","<p>The short answer is that these are ""standard"" frequencies set aside for IF use and are reasonable free from interference.</p>

<p>The longer answer follows if you are interested in the why.</p>

<p>The choice of an IF frequency is one of those design tradeoffs.</p>

<p>The lower the IF frequency used, the easier it is to achieve a narrow bandwidth to obtain good selectivity in the receiver and the greater the IF stage gain. On the other hand, the higher the IF, the further removed the image frequency is from the signal frequency and hence the better the image rejection. </p>

<p>One problem of the problems of a superheterodyne receiver, is its ability to pick up a second or image frequency that is twice the intermediate frequency away from the signal frequency.</p>

<p>For example, if we have a signal frequency of 1 MHz which is mixed with an IF of 455kHz. A second or image signal, with a frequency equal to 1 MHz plus (2 x 455) kHz or 1.910 MHz, can also mix with the 1.455 MHz to produce the 455 kHz.</p>

<p>The choice of IF is also affected by the selectivity of the RF end of the receiver. If the receiver has a number of RF stages, it is better able to reject an image signal close to the signal frequency and hence a lower IF channel can be tolerated.  This is why modern rigs have 2 or even 3 IF stages.</p>

<p>The chosen IF frequency should be free from radio interference. Standard intermediate frequencies have been established and these are kept dear of signal channel allocation.</p>

<p>As you have noted, 455KHz is a common IF.  This is because broadcasters settled on this as a standard frequency during the broadcast AM days.</p>

<p>From a design point of view 455KHz it leads to poor image response when used above 10 MHz. One commonly used IF for shortwave receivers is 1.600 MHz and this gives a much improved image response for the HF spectrum.  Ham band SSB HF transceivers have commonly used 9 MHz as a receiver intermediate frequency </p>

<p>This frequency is a little high for ordinary tuned circuits to achieve the narrow bandwidth needed in speech communication, however, when used with ceramic crystal filter networks it leads to good results.</p>

<p>Some recent amateur transceivers use intermediate frequencies slightly below 9 MHz. A frequency of 8.830 MHz can be found in various Kenwood transceivers and a frequency of 8.987.5 MHz in some Yaesu transceivers. This change could possibly be to avoid the second harmonic of the IF falling too near the edge of the 17m WARC band. </p>

"50 Ohm coaxial cable vs 450 Ohm or 600 Ohm ladder or window line?","3159","","<p>What are the relative advantages and disadvantages of using 50 Ohm coaxial cable as opposed to 450 Ohm or 600 Ohm ladder or window line?</p>
","<h2>Cheaper &amp; less loss</h2>

<p>The main advantage of two-wire transmission lines over coaxial cable is, apart from reduced cost, also much lower loss. This is because the dielectric in two-wire lines is predominantly air. Plastic dielectrics provide more loss.
In that respect, open-wire line has the least loss of all two-wire transmission lines, window-line a bit more and twin-lead ribbon line even more so.</p>

<h2>Loss measurements</h2>

<p>A classic paper by Wes Stewart, N7WS reports on <a href=""http://www.k6mhe.com/n7ws/LadderLineUpdate.PDF"" rel=""nofollow"">loss measurements of 450Ω ""Wireman"" window-line</a>. An impedance-matched, 100ft length of medium-grade type 552 window-line showed 0.24dB loss at 20MHz under dry conditions. In contrast, the <em>ARRL Antenna Book</em> reports for an impedance-matched 100ft length of RG-213 coaxial cable at the same frequency a loss of slightly more than 1.0dB.</p>

<h2>Additional mismatch loss</h2>

<p>Please, notice twice the use of the word ""impedance-matched"" in the previous paragraph. This is because a mismatched line will suffer additional power loss. The maximum voltage and current amplitudes on a mismatched line are proportional to the square root of the standing-wave ratio $(\sqrt{SWR})$. This increase in effective current raises the ohmic losses $(I^{2}R)$ accordingly, whereas the increase in effective voltage increases the losses in the dielectric $(\frac{E^{2}}{R})$.</p>

<h2>Typical use case</h2>

<p>From a practical point of view, suppose you happen to have a severely mismatched antenna and you chose to perform the impedance matching not at the antenna but in the shack. In such a case, it is in your interest to use a two-wire line of sufficient voltage and current rating over a coaxial cable. Not only will the loss and cost be much lower than with coax, also a voltage breakdown of the dielectric will be less likely to occur.</p>

<p>For insanely high power levels (broadcast), four- and five-wire lines may offer a solution.</p>

"What is the effect of using different number of radials with ground plane antenna","3143","","<p>I'm new to electronics and telecommunication at all, I having trouble with understanding the difference between 2, 3 and 4 radials, as I've searched online I've learned that I can use only 1 radial(and it makes sense) but when using 2, 3 or 4 its to supply a counterpoise to the ground(<strong>balance?</strong>).</p>

<p>Other source talked about 2 radials:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The object of the two radials is to produce a canceling signal in the
  horizontal plane. They do this by being driven together. However, they
  must radiate a canceling field. That means they must be matched to
  radiate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is the above quote also apply to 4 radials and anyway what is true is it only for <strong>balance</strong> or <strong>canceling</strong> maybe I'm confused and its about both, if anyone can help me make sense from all I will be very thankful.</p>
","<p>An ideal vertical doesn't have radials: it's half a dipole sitting upon a perfectly conductive, infinite plane. Under these idealized conditions, its radiation pattern is identical to a dipole's radiation pattern that's been sliced in half (like a bagel), and the vertical's feedpoint impedance is exactly half that of a dipole.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/RLkhN.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/RLkhN.png"" alt=""the radiation pattern of an ideal vertical is just like a dipole, missing the bottom half.""></a></p>

<p>When the plane under the vertical deviates from this ideal, the effect is generally that radiation at low angles is reduced, and the antenna becomes less efficient due to resistive losses in the ground. This happens if the ground plane isn't very conductive (like dirt), or if it isn't infinitely long.</p>

<p>Here are some simulated results to illustrate, thanks to <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/users/4306/jsh"">JSH</a>:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GmKl1.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GmKl1.png"" alt=""simulated radiation patterns over ground planes of varying quality""></a>

<p>More radials, and longer radials, moves you closer to the ideal. Less radials, or shorter radials, moves you closer to a dummy load. If you have no radials at all then the feedline will be the radial and you end up with something not unlike a dipole (albeit a very oddly shaped one).</p>

<p>With just two radials, then if you view the antenna from one side (perpendicular to the radials), you have a pretty good ground plane to the left and to the right. But if you walk 90 degrees around the antenna so that the radials are coming at you, there are no radials at all to the left and the right, and consequently in those directions you'll get less radiation. Such an antenna isn't perfectly omnidirectional, but it can be good enough. A mag-mount on a balcony railing is essentially this.</p>

<p>Once you have three radials, the pattern is more or less omnidirectional. Of course this is still very far from an ideal, infinite ground plane, but modeling and empirical evidence have shown that if the radials are elevated (to minimize interaction with the ground) and trimmed to resonant lengths, the results are for practical purposes very good.</p>

<p>If your radials are in the ground, then 16 is sufficient to have a good ground plane. The lengths don't matter too much since they will be detuned by the ground anyway. Anything longer than a quarter-wave is good.</p>

","<p>Outside of the <code>-w</code> receive options, <code>hackrf_transfer</code> always deals in 8-bit signed IQ samples, raw with no file headers.</p>

<p>You must also make sure that the sample rate of the data matches the sample rate specified on the command line and is a rate supported by the HackRF hardware. WAV files contain the sample rate information in a header, but raw files have no place to put it, and in RF signals it can be undesirable for programs to attempt automatic sample rate conversion anyway.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Modulation</h2>

<p>Before considering converting a WAV file, you need to ensure you actually have RF (IQ) samples, not audio; that is, it must be <em>modulated</em>. If you got the recording from another program which explicitly says it produces IQ output, then that's fine.</p>

<p>If you have audio data, and the signal is intended to be fed to a single-sideband (SSB) transmitter, such as most HF digital modes, then you can use it anyway, but you will get double-sideband (DSB) transmission — two copies of the signal, one with the spectrum inverted. This may be adequate for testing purposes, but don't make a habit of it as you're wasting bandwidth.</p>

<p>If you have audio data which is intended to be modulated as FM (such as an AFSK APRS packet, for example), then you will need to modulate it. This can be done fairly easily given the right tools, as I will describe below.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Conversion</h2>

<p>I recommend that you install <strong>GNU Radio</strong>. While it is primarily intended for real-time processing, and can in fact talk directly to the HackRF One, it can also be used to convert files.</p>

<p>In GNU Radio's graphical tool, <strong>GNU Radio Companion</strong>, you can design a ""flow graph"" to read a file, write a file, and do any particular conversions along the way, such as for your case:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WeChN.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WeChN.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Here we take the two “stereo” channels of the WAV file (which GNU Radio automatically converts to floats in the &minus;1 to +1 range), put them in alternating left-right-left-right sequence, resample it from an assumed rate of 44.1 kHz to 2 MHz (that being the minimum supported by the HackRF One), rescale to &minus;127 to +127, and write to the raw output file (which will have the same sample rate as the input file).</p>

<p>If you needed to perform modulation (as I described above) as well, that would be just another block or two in this chain.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, GRC does have some limitations — for example, this has the filenames hardcoded into it. But GRC generates (overly verbose) Python programs which you can then clean up into something reasonable, or write from scratch once you're familiar with the vocabulary.</p>

<p>There is a lot to learn to use GNU Radio effectively, but it is a very useful tool for SDR experimentation, if with some rough edges, and I recommend it.</p>

<p>There are no good areas inside the vehicle, the body makes a moderately effective Faraday cage and the losses are brutal.

"How do I prevent radio signals from tripping a GFCI?","2815","","<p>My wife woke up several nights by a metallic ""thunk"".  It happened to be while I was talking on 10 meters and turned out to be the ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) on her hair dryer cord.  Apart from the obvious answer of leaving it unplugged, I'm looking for a solution to preventing this because I'm concerned there are other effects of which I'm not aware.</p>

<p>At the time, I had not completed the grounding of my newly set up shack.  I've since established an earth ground using a backup water well point pipe in my basement (it's electrically isolated from the pump by a PVC connect pipe and is hardly used so I'm not worried about regular interference from that).  Unfortunately, the 12v supply for the HF radio doesn't seem to have a ground stud on it so I can't ground that apart from the regular mains cord ground.  The antenna mast is grounded to a typical 8ft ground rod using a 6AWG wire.  But despite my efforts at proper grounding, the problem still occurs.</p>

<p>Is the GFCI tripping due to improper grounding or possibly due to RFI (which additional or better grounding wouldn't necessarily fix)?  And how could this tripping be prevented?

<p>Assuming a transmitter power of 1kW: $V_{peak}=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\sqrt{P\cdot R}=\sqrt{\frac{P\cdot R}{2}}=\sqrt{\frac{10^3 \cdot \not 2 \cdot 10^3}{\not 2}}=10^\frac{6}{2}=10^3=1kV$</p>

<p>If the antenna is loaded with a coil, the impedance will be transformed up to an even higher value. This is how a Tesla coil works. The resulting corona effect might be quite dramatic as shown in the picture below (1kW on 80m in short W4JRW dual-band dipole @ HB9DWU).</p>

"How do I extend broken coaxial cable?","2744","","<p>I have a piece of 75 ohm coaxial cable of unknown type (outer diameter is around 7 mm) which has developed a breakage in the center conductor (which is stranded). This cable is an adapter cable which connects my RG-6 type coaxial cable to my RTL-SDR card. </p>

<p>As far as I understand, the best way to solve the issue would be to simply replace the cable with another cable of higher quality. Unfortunately, this solution is not applicable to me, since the ends of the cable are attached to connectors of types which I can't easily obtain. The card end uses MCX connector and the RG-6 end uses a type of Belling-Lee connector suited for work with thin coaxial cables. </p>

<p>Second idea that came to me and which I used with success with some other coaxial cables is to cut out the middle, damaged, section and leave short pieces of cable near the connectors I can't replace. After that, connect easily obtainable connectors to the healthy ends of the cable and mate the new connectors or use another coaxial cable in the middle. </p>

<p>SMA and RP-SMA connectors come to my mind here, but the problem is that they are 50 ohm connectors in general. I also don't have the tools to install them and this one-off repair doesn't justify obtaining such tools. </p>

<p>Another idea that I like the least but am currently most likely going to go with would be to directly connect the two healthy ends of the cable. Solder together the inner conductors, cover the joint with heatshink tube, then carefully solder together outer braided conductors and cover them in heatshrink tube as well. Problem here is that I don't like the reliability of the resulting work. A variation of this theme would be to solder the healthy ends of the existing cable to a new piece of a different, but similar, coaxial cable. The effect of this is that I'd have more room to work with. </p>

<p>Finally the worst solution I see right now would be to replace the connector on the card which uses the damaged coaxial cable with an SMA connector. The problem with this is that SMA connectors are in general 50 ohm connectors and this is a 75 ohm system. </p>

<p>So my question is basically how do I repair this cable? Which of the options I could work with is the least bad and are there any better ideas I didn't think of?</p>
","<p>A complete replacement will be the most reliable solution.  Baring that, replacement of one end if the resulting size is acceptable.  I would rate a manual repair dead last.  Soldered joints are rigid and even if the repair holds, it will place stress on adjacent sections of coax.</p>

<p>These connectors and in fact, complete cables with MCX on one end and a Belling-Lee connector on the other are available, inexpensively, on eBay.  One UK shop lists them all: <a href=""http://stores.ebay.com/RFShopUK"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stores.ebay.com/RFShopUK</a>.  They cost from about 2.00USD for the ends to about 10.00USD for the whole cable.</p>

"What are the I and Q in quadrature sampling?","2712","","<p>For some reason I've long believed that given I and Q, one corresponds to amplitude, and one to phase, so I thought that I could hold one steady and create AM, or hold the other steady and create FM.</p>

<p>Now that I'm delving more into it, though, it appears I'm completely wrong.  Or not.  I'm not really sure, and the articles I'm reading aren't helping the situation.</p>

<p>Can AM and FM be demodulated from quadrature signals relatively easily?  I feel that if I understand this, I might be able to wrap my head around it.</p>
","<p>Your understanding is almost correct. I/Q data represents phase and amplitude, but in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system"" rel=""nofollow"">Cartesian coordinates</a>. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinate_system#Converting_between_polar_and_Cartesian_coordinates"" rel=""nofollow"">Conversion between the two</a> is elementary trigonometry:</p>

<p>$$ r = \sqrt{I^2+Q^2} \\
\theta = \text{atan2}(Q, I) $$</p>

<p>To demodulate AM, you just need $r$, and to demodulate FM, you just need $\theta$.</p>

<p>Usually, an I/Q pair is represented as a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number"" rel=""nofollow"">complex number</a>, with $I$ being the real part, and $Q$ being the imaginary part. This makes possible some interesting mathematical manipulations like multiplying a signal by a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_formula"" rel=""nofollow"">complex exponential</a> to make a mixer. However, unlike a usual (""non-complex"") <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_mixer"" rel=""nofollow"">mixer</a>, this mixer does not make <em>two</em> new signals (sum and difference), but rather <em>just one</em>. This ability to shift a spectrum of frequencies without creating an additional sideband (which must then be filtered out, typically) is a big win in DSP.</p>

"Why prefer LC oscillators rather than RC oscillators in RF design?","2712","","<p>I don't recall ever seeing an RC oscillator driven RF transmitter or receiver.</p>

<p>What prevents people from choosing RC oscillators in RF design?</p>
","<p>I'm going to discuss <em>filters</em> and not <em>oscillators</em>, because the reasons are pretty much the same. An oscillator is just a filter with enough gain to put it on the edge of stability.</p>

<p>It certainly is possible to use RC filters in RF design, and sometimes you do see them in non-critical filters, especially those that don't require a steep filter or high power handling, such as AC coupling between stages. Reasons you might not want to use inductors:</p>

<ul>
<li>They are expensive to manufacture</li>
<li>Real inductors have significant non-ideal properties

<ul>
<li>saturation current</li>
<li>series resistance</li>
<li>inter-winding capacitance (for transformers, a special case of inductor)</li>
<li>leakage inductance</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Resistors and capacitors also have non-ideal properties (lead inductance) and aren't free, but the magnitude of these problems is less.</p>

<p>Reasons you might want to include inductors in your circuits:</p>

<ul>
<li>A LC circuit has two <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/questions/1504/what-is-meant-by-poles-when-discussing-filters"">poles</a>, where an RC filter has only one. You can get two poles with two RC circuits, but often that's just more components.</li>
<li>An inductor's impedance increases with frequency, while a capacitor's inductance decreases with frequency. For many filter topologies you need both kinds of impedance (for example, a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antenna_tuner#Pi_network"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Pi network</a>). You can simulate an inductor from a capacitor and an inductor using a circuit called a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyrator#Application:_a_simulated_inductor"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">gyrator</a>, but this has additional disadvantages:

<ul>
<li>The simulated inductance must have some resistance also, limiting <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_factor"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Q factor</a></li>
<li>It increases complexity, and requires an op-amp capable of RF operation, which can be hard or expensive at higher frequencies</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Related to the previous point, if you have a capacitive impedance (such as all RC filters have), and you want to transform that to a purely resistive impedance (usually, 50Ω), then you need an inductor. Try playing with a <a href=""http://www.fourier-series.com/rf-concepts/smithchart.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Smith chart</a> to see why.</li>
<li>Resistors convert electrical energy to heat, where (ideal) inductors do not. Obviously you wouldn't want anything turning your transmit energy into heat instead of electromagnetic radiation.</li>

"How does moving a feedpoint off-center in a dipole affect the resonant frequency and resistive load?","2650","","<p>Specifically, I understand that OCF dipoles change the SWR, but does it do this via reactance or resistance, or both?</p>
","<p>I'm going to assume we are discussing <em>ideal</em>, <em>resonant</em> dipoles.</p>

<p>Consider what's happening inside the dipole. Say you are transmitting a carrier. Say at one point in this carrier's cycle, the voltage is shoving all the charge carriers to the left.</p>

<p>What makes the dipole <em>resonant</em> is this: those charge carriers get pushed down the wire. As the approach the end, they get compressed because they have nowhere to go. This over-abundance of charge carriers means a high voltage at the end of the wire. They can't shoot out the end of the wire, so that wave of force bounces back. In a center-fed half-wavelength dipole, the wave reaches the feedpoint after having bounced off the end at precisely when the transmitter has changed phase 180 degrees, and is now trying to push the charge carriers in the other direction. Thus, the natural bouncing back and forth action in the antenna is in phase with the transmitter, helping it to move more current, with less voltage.</p>

<p>This explains two things on the FCC test:</p>

<ul>
<li>The voltage distribution in a half-wave dipole is highest at the ends and lowest in the middle.</li>
<li>The current distribution is highest in the middle and lowest at the ends.</li>
</ul>

<p>We know that our center-fed half-wavelength dipole has a feedpoint impedance of 75Ω. That means at the feedpoint, for every ampere, there are 75 volts (think of Ohm's law). This is true both of RMS measurements, and any instantaneous measurement.</p>

<p>This last bit, that the instantaneous current or voltage at any time also have a ratio of 75V to 1A (that is, 75Ω), is just another way of saying that the feedpoint impedance is purely resistive. Our ideal dipole doesn't actually have any resistance: this resistance is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_resistance"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">radiation resistance</a> of the antenna. The antenna creates the illusion of a pure resistance from a tuned system of reactive components which, <em>at resonance</em>, cancel each other to leave only a resistive impedance.</p>

<p><em>But what if the feedpoint isn't in the center?</em></p>

<p>This actually doesn't change the resonant frequency: it just changes the impedance, which remains resistive. Consider what happens if we move the feedpoint just a little closer to one end: we also get farther from the other end. We know that in the center of a half-wave dipole, current is at a maximum. This makes sense, because after the charge carriers pass the center, they are now closer to the other end, building up voltage there, which serves to slow them down. So, if we aren't in the center, we get less help with current, but we get more help with voltage. That is, impedance goes up. We can couple energy just as efficiently into this antenna, provided we can match its impedance.</p>

<p>The common choice of the center of a half-wave dipole is usually selected because it's close enough to 50Ω coax that losses are acceptable without any additional matching. Wikipedia gives <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipole_antenna#Half-wave_dipole"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the math to calculate the impedance at an arbitrary point</a> for a half-wave dipole:</p>

<p>$$ R_r = \frac{75\ \Omega}{\sin^2(2 x \pi / \lambda)} $$</p>

<p>Where:</p>

<ul>
<li>$x$ is the distance from the end of the dipole, and</li>
<li>$\lambda$ is the wavelength (twice the length of the dipole).</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, say we have a dipole for $\lambda = 100\:\mathrm m$. Fed at the center, $x = 25$ because this half-wave dipole is 50m long, so the middle is half of that, 25m from the end:</p>

<p>$$ R_r
= \frac{75\ \Omega}{\sin^2(2 \cdot 25 \cdot \pi / 100)}
= 75\:\Omega $$</p>

<p>Fed 1/3rd of the way from the end, $x=50/3=16.67$:</p>

<p>$$ R_r
= \frac{75\ \Omega}{\sin^2(2 \cdot 16.67 \cdot \pi / 100)}
= 100\:\Omega $$</p>

"How is ""clarifier"" control helpful?","2615","","<p>My radio-club recently got a Yaesu FT-225RD transceiver and I'm trying to digest its manual (available for download <a href=""http://www.radiomanual.info/schemi/FT225RD_user.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>). This is the first ham radio that I'm learning how to use, so I could be missing something obvious.</p>

<p>On the front panel there's a knob marked CLARIFIER and the manual has following description for it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The clarifier control allows a means of offsetting the transceive or
  receive frequency by ±4 kHz from the frequency established by the main
  VFO dial.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do understand that radio's frequency will drift with time and that not everyone's rig will be spot on channel and that in such cases minor adjustments may be needed to improve reception.</p>

<p>What I don't understand is when would use of clarifier be preferable to use of the main frequency dial. From what I can see, the main dial offers pretty good resolution for frequency adjustment and clarifier isn't a fancy name for a fine-tune knob I've seen on on radio receivers for commercial FM band from the same time period. </p>

<p>UPDATE: One thing that I didn't find relevant to the question at first is that in addition to the clarifier knob, there is a clarifier switch as well which is used to set clarifier to one of 3 settings: transceive, receive and off. This would imply (at least in my opinion) that in transceive setting, the clarifier would affect frequencies of both transmission and reception.</p>
","<p>I think ""RIT"", for ""receiver incremental tuning"", is a better name for that knob because it more directly explains what it does: it tunes the receiver, without tuning the transmitter. The result is that you receive and transmit on different frequencies. It is similar to <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/q/1104/218"">operating split</a>, with less frequency separation.</p>

<p>This is most useful when you've already started a contact, but now you want to change your tuning. If you re-tune by adjusting the main VFO, you also move your transmitter. Now the other guy will have to re-tune to you, then you re-tune to him, and so on, until you have walked out of the band.</p>

<p>Tuning could be off for any number of reasons. There are some people who aren't very good at accurately tuning SSB, or perhaps they just don't mind the <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/q/355/218"">weird way it makes voices sound</a>, or they have old equipment without a stable VFO. Listen to any SSB net for an example. I suspect this is the origin of the term ""clarifier"". In CW operation, not everyone tunes accurately to their sidetone frequency. Especially in CW operation, you might want to tune your receiver to get the signal into a narrow filter passband, or to get some noise in the stopband.</p>

","<p>Back in the olden days, before transceivers took over, the transmitter and receiver were separate units, and the receiver had to be protected from the transmitter. The solution then, as now, is an electronic T/R switch. One approach is an RF sensor that triggers a relay; the MFJ-1708 is one example. A more sophisticated approach uses an active element to isolate the receiver. Used to be a vacuum tube, and if you do a Google search you'll find lots of DIY TR switch projects for vintage radio fans.</p>

"RF Transceiver for walkie talkie use","2582","","<p>I'm close to my EE. BSc finale and I'm looking to play around a little bit with the stuff I've learned. To be honest, I'm a little bit upset that after 4 years of learning communications theory, I'm not able to choose the hardware I need.</p>

<p>My idea is to build a half-duplex walkie-talkie with the following reqs:</p>

<li>ISM frequency use. (I prefer 433 MHZ UHF bands.)</li>

","<p>The chip you've linked is capable of analog FM transmission and reception, from 2.5kHz to 80kHz bandwidth.  In the frequency range you're looking at it has a frequency resolution of 12.5kHz. It's very low power, with the right antenna it should reach your target LOS.  Check out Figure 4.2 in the <a href=""http://www.melexis.com/Assets/TH7122-and-TH71221-Cookbook-3961.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">TH7122 and TH71221 Cookbook</a> for an example showing how to use the chip as an analog FM transmitter, and figure 6.7 for an example of how to use it as an FM receiver.  By combining the two circuits with the typical application circuit you can build a single-chip analog FM transceiver.</p>

<p>Note that your requirement, ""Single chip that doesn't require extra elements as crystal or filters"" is going to be hard to meet with any radio design.  There are several inductors and capacitors used as filters outside most ""single chip"" transceivers.  If you want any frequency stability you're going to need a crystal.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.nxp.com/documents/leaflet/75015689.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Philips SA58646</a> is also a good choice, but again you're going to have to deal with a few inductors, capacitors, and a crystal.</p>

<p>Also note that with such low power devices your antennas are going to have to be very, very good, and probably very large.  If you don't want to spend a lot of time and effort on antennas, or need small antennas, then you'll have to trade off some additional effort adding an RF amplifier to these devices and consuming more power.</p>

The radio linked is a cheap HT for the UHF band, runs on 3.7V, and has a 3W output.  It's under $20, and if you remove the battery, casing, controls, connectors, then the one or two PCBs that are left are very small.  It does appear to have a low power TX setting, so you should be able to set it to 1W output rather than the full output power if you have power consumption concerns beyond requiring low voltage. You may even consider modifying the radio to remove the PA and use the very low output prior to the PA, saving significantly more power.</p>

","<p>We're about half way down in the waning years of Cycle 24. We're currently on a 9 day stretch with zero sunspots, the first such stretch since 2010. </p>

<p>With the number of sunspots dwindling, we've seen little F layer propagation on frequencies above 25MHz in the last 2 months, and that downward trend is likely to continue. As we approach minimum in 2018(ish), frequencies above 15MHz will only open sporadically and usually thanks to Sporadic E or Trans-equitorial low angle F layer propagation for a couple weeks on either side of the Equinoxes. </p>

<p>In addition to the impact on the higher bands, the mid bands like 20m and 30m will no longer stay open all night, though they will generally continue to produce good DX during the day even at solar minimum. During the minimum of cycle 23, 20 meters rarely failed to open in the afternoon.</p>

<p>The lower solar activity actually improves conditions on 160m, 80m, and to some extent 40m, as there will be less D layer absorption, so those bands will open earlier in the evening and stay open later in to the morning than they have in the past few years. They will also experience fewer ionospheric disturbances and geomagnetic storms as solar activity tapers off.</p>

<p>This cycle was unusually quiet, and the previous minimum was unusually and unexpectedly protracted, so most predictions regarding the various trends and extremes of cycle 24 have so far proven to be inaccurate. It's difficult to say for sure how deep this minimum is likely to be, or how long it will last, but it is safe to assume that the occasional article that pops up claiming we're entering a new Maunder Minimum or the like are just psuedo-scientific rantings. This cycle caught everyone off guard, and proved just how bad we are at predicting these things.</p>

<p>Historically, if we look at the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle#/media/File:Sunspot_Numbers.png"">long term trends</a> we can see that while cycle 24 was quite weak, if we look at the cycles before it, there is a clear cyclic trend that dates back to at least the late 18th century. It would appear we're entering a low point in that larger cycle, but it seems likely that cycle 25 and 26 will rebound somewhat or be about the same. Given the rapid descent from the peak in 2014, however, it seems safe to assume this will be another unusually long minimum.</p>

"When is RF grounding necessary, and when is it not?","2489","","<p>I've seen many installations, particularly at field day and also in second-floor installations, where RF grounding is ignored entirely. What are the drawbacks to this and when is it absolutely essential to have RF grounding?</p>
","<p>I think there might be confusion between RF ground, counterpoise, and electrical safety grounding.  I am going to restrict my answer to RF ground (but, the word counterpoise is often used for the same thing).</p>

<p>In a perfectly balanced antenna, such as a Dipole at its resonant frequency, there is no need for an RF ground since no current would flow to the RF ground (like I said, in a perfect balanced antenna).</p>

<p>In a perfectly unbalanced antenna, such as a 1/4-wave vertical, an RF ground (aka counterpoise) is absolutely necessary to ""complete"" the antenna and make it whole.  As they say, the ground image of your quarter wave antenna is the ""other half"" of the antenna and current will flow in this ground.</p>

<p>This is why a quarter wave antenna needs some sort of RF ground counterpoise made of conductors to make this current flow less lossy.  Just relying on the ground itself results in a very lossy other half of your vertical and thus definitely not as efficient.  In general, the more you can make the ground a good conductor (more radials, etc.) then the more efficient your antenna will be.</p>

<p>Given these two extremes, the need for an RF ground depends on all kinds of situations where the actual individual antenna geometry, height above ground, other nearby conductors, and so on come into play.</p>

<p>If your dipole antenna is not balanced for example, then common-mode current will flow down your feed line and radiate or enter into your shack and cause other problems.  Making sure that your equipment is well grounded may help eliminate some of this RFI but it is best to eliminate the common-mode currents using an RF choke at the antenna feed point.</p>

<p>In summary, for good balanced antennas such as dipoles, Yagis, and similar geometries, RF grounding should not be necessary.  If you have an unbalanced antenna like a vertical or a single long-wire antenna, or an inverted-L, or similar then a ground plane (RF ground) is required for efficient operating.</p>

<p>The Wilderness Protocol for VHF/UHF (<a href=""http://k4jwm.com/wilderness-protocol.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://k4jwm.com/wilderness-protocol.htm</a>) is useful if you have line of sight communication. That might not be the case in mountainous terrain. The Wilderness Protocol was started in the US, so I have no idea how often it is used outside the US.</p>

<p>Finally, amateur radio requires practice for effective emergency use. In a group, you need at least two practiced operators, because one of them might be injured. In most situations, a satellite phone is a better and more reliable choice for backcountry emergency communication. I go into more detail on that in this blog post:</p>

<p>One good way to get practice with back country operating is to participate in Summits on the Air (SOTA). The common SOTA frequencies might also be a good choice for secondary emergency frequencies, because the SOTA ""chasers"" often monitor those.</p>

"What's the difference between ""minimum SWR"" and ""resonance""?","2369","","<p>Is the point of minimum SWR equivalent to resonance? Exactly what does resonance mean, anyway?</p>
","<p>Good questions.  But, I think another question to add is:  What is more important, SWR or resonance?</p>

<p>Given that this is the ""Amateur Radio"" forum, I think answers that are most meaningful to amateur radio operators are more justified in this discussion.  The reason I say this is that resonance and SWR as testified by several exchanges and questions are debatable things.</p>

<p>For example, I operate regularly on 80, 40, 30, 20, 15, 12, and 10 meter bands.  I sometimes visit 17 meters once in a great while.  But, given all those bands and the frequencies I operate NONE of my antennas are resonant.  That is because true resonance is at a single frequency for a given antenna (e.g. Dipole).  But, if the SWR is within reasonable limits or it handled by an antenna tuner (aka match coupler) then the antennas are very effective even when not resonant.</p>

<p>There are several definitions of resonance.  In general, if the antenna impedance at a given frequency is purely resistive, with zero reactance (or, near zero) then that antenna can be considered resonant at that frequency.  This resistance is not usually the same as the typical 50-ohm output of a transmitter.  In fact, a perfect dipole (with no ground effects) has a radiation resistance of approximately 71 ohms.  Thus, this perfect resonant antenna does not have a SWR of 1:1 because the resistance is not 50 ohms.</p>

<p>But, SWR is important too for two different reasons.  First, to protect the PA circuits of a solid state transmitter (or, amplifier).  Reflected voltage can destroy the output transistors so low SWR helps protect the solid-state circuitry.  Most modern transmitters (transceivers) have protection circuits to roll back power to safe levels when the SWR is too high.  My own Elecraft K3 starts this when faced by an SWR at a little over 2:1.</p>

<p>The second reason SWR is important is to limit the losses in transmission line between the transmitter/transceiver/receiver and the antenna.  The higher SWR causes the losses to increase  There are calculators available on-line (and the ARRL TransmissionLine application) to compute the losses given the input and load SWR or actual $R+jX$ impedance.  I have written my own in Mathematica.</p>

<p>In addition, SWR is often an indicator of problems in an antenna system.  Monitoring SWR is something that should be done by ham operators as it will show problems.  One afternoon I was preparing for a CW Traffic Net schedule and did a quick key down merely to look at my SWR.  It spiked with the alert beep sounding plus red LED lights blinking.  I looked out into the back yard and saw that my 80 meter dipole was laying on the ground.  One of my anchor point ties had failed.</p>

<p>Minimum SWR (as asked in the question) has nothing to do with resonance (by itself).  If I tune up on the 160 meter band using my 80 meter dipole I can find a minimum SWR and that minimum is on the order of 250:1 or so.  My tuner is good but it can't handle that wide of an SWR.  But, a resonant antenna should have a low SWR and likely at the likely minimum at the resonant frequency.  But, as I mentioned earlier for the dipole, this low SWR will not usually be 1:1 as the actual radiation resistance for the antenna is almost always not the same as the 50 ohms expected by the transmitter.</p>

<p>Personally, when I am building antennas, managing and designing for minimum SWR across the frequencies I want to operate is the most important thing.  Minimum SWR is hopefully under 3:1 for most of a band but even my 80 meter dipole has a higher SWR at the high end of the band (3.9 MHz) with an SWR about 5:1 (my tuner matches this with no problems but I do have to pay for that higher SWR in the transmission loss to the antenna which is the reason I use LMR400 low loss coaxial cable.  One of my Mathematica programs will do a full 3 to 30 MHz sweep (all frequencies in 20 KHz steps) of my antennas I am designing (in concert with solutions produced by NEC4) and I compute the SWR, smooth interpolate it, and then plot the results.  Visually I can see all the low SWR (under 3:1) spots for a given length of wire of the antenna.</p>

"Coaxial Folded Dipole Antenna Matching Impedance","2357","","<p>In <a href=""http://www.nsw.wicen.org.au/technical/projects/coaxial-folded-dipole-antenna"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nsw.wicen.org.au/technical/projects/coaxial-folded-dipole-antenna</a>, the guy is using a 50 ohm coax cable to build a folded dipole antenna and claims that this will enable use at 50 ohm (I assume the required matching impedance).</p>

<p>Now, from my understanding, the impedance of a folded dipole is based on the theoretical radiation resistance of a dipole (73 ohm) multiplied by 4 since folded. This is roughly 300 ohm and does not depends on the cable itself.</p>

<p>Is that correct?</p>
","<p>The site above depicts a regular dipole, with a simple matching system.<br>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PmxHS.png"" alt=""Antenna in question""></p>

<p>First, a bit about dipole impedance. The impedance of a dipole is 73 Ohms at resonance, but away from the resonant frequency the impedance is different. At frequencies lower than resonance, i.e. when the antenna is too short, it is capacitive, and its resistance is lower.<br>
The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_chart"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Smith Chart</a> is the usual way of plotting this. 50 ohms is in the middle, short circuit on the left, open circuit is on the right.<br>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YX7F1.png"" alt=""Dipole on smith chart""><br>
If it makes more sense, you can see them on a regular X-Y chart.<br>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9cmDN.png"" alt=""Dipole on x-y chart""><br>
It's fairly simple to choose a point where the impedance is 50 -j something ohms. Then to match the antenna, only a series inductor is required. Please excuse my wobbly inductors.<br>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ScE8f.png"" alt=""Antenna with inductors""></p>

<p>Now a bit about the stubs.<br>
The impedance of a short-circuited coaxial cable, like this:<br>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PDEe7.png"" alt=""Short circuit stub""><br>
is given by the equation  </p>

<p>$Zin = j * Z_0 * tan(\beta x)$<br>
where  $\beta = 2 \pi / \lambda$<br>
and $Z_0$ is the impedance of the line, in this case $50 \Omega$.</p>

<p>This can also be done on the Smith chart.</p>

<p>The two short-circuited stubs each need to contribute about 80 ohms of reactance, so they will be a bit over 1/8 of a wavelength long. They're further contracted by the velocity factor of the coax.</p>

<p>The inductive reactance cancels the antenna capacitive reactance, resulting in a perfect 50 Ohm match.</p>

<p>That's how it works. Now for some comments about the antenna.</p>

<p>First, about bandwidth: The capacitance of the antenna and inductance of the stubs both change over frequency. The antenna gets more capacitive at frequencies below resonance, requiring more inductance to match, but the inductance of the stub <em>drops</em> at lower frequencies. This leads to a reduced bandwidth from this antenna, as compared to one matched with a transformer or some other way. Note the narrow VSWR curve on the left. In fact, if your radio could tolerate a VSWR of 2:1 or more, you'd be better off <em>not</em> using any coax stub to match it.<br>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FcDln.png"" alt=""Bandwidth plot"">  </p>

<p>This makes me think this isn't such a great choice of antenna - the ham bands are already wide enough that a regular dipole isn't perfectly matched across the band, so this one will be even narrower.</p>

<p>Second, about the balun: The site doesn't mention any Balun. This is a huge problem!! The feed cable of these antennas will carry current, perhaps half as much as the antenna itself, and so the VSWR will be affected by the length of the cable, the equipment connected to it, the ham moving around in the shack, everything. This is just bad practice. With any antenna design, the balun should be the first problem you solve, and then worry about the matching.<br>
<a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/a/555/2988"">See this very comprehensive answer</a> for more about why you need a balun when connecting an dipole to coax.</p>

<p>Finally, the impedance of a dipole like this will only be $50 \Omega$ in free space. An antenna is <em>never</em> in free space, unless it's hanging off a cubesat. The supporting mast, or just the feedline, will affect its impedance.  A good design starts by considering those effects, mechanical support, grounding for static, safety and lighting, then the balun, and finally the matching.</p>

"Conversion from Baud to Bits per Second and then to Bytes per Second","2350","","<p>How would I go about converting from Baud to Bits per Second (bps) and then from Bits per Second to Bytes per Second (Bps)?</p>
","<p><em>Baud</em> is another name for <em>symbols per second</em> (a unit of <em>symbol rate</em>), so you can't convert between it and the others (which are units of <em>bit rate</em>) without knowing <em>how many symbols are in use</em>.</p>

<p>A <em>symbol</em> is the smallest unit of a digital modulation. For example, suppose we're doing on-off keying (also known as CW): the signal can be either present or absent, so there are two symbols. If we were to also use two intermediate amplitudes between ""off"" and ""full power"", that would make a total of four symbols. (Digital modulations in amateur radio use frequency-shift keying (e.g. RTTY, JT65/JT9) but this is easier to picture to start with.)</p>

<p>(Using more than two symbols allows you to encode more bits per symbol, which allows for more efficient use of bandwidth for a given data rate.)</p>

<p>For the conversion, suppose there are $M$ symbols. Then each symbol can be used to encode $\log_2 M$ bits. Inversely, for a whole number of bits $N$, then you need $2^N$ different symbols to encode all those bits in one symbol. Thus the conversion between baud and bits per second is:</p>

<p>$$
1\,\mathrm{baud} = N\,\mathrm{b/s} \\
\text{ or } \\
1\,\mathrm{baud} = \log_2M\,\mathrm{b/s}
$$</p>

<hr>

<p>The conversion between bits per second and bytes per second is, in practice, much simpler: there are 8 bits ($\mathrm{b}$) in a byte ($\mathrm{B}$).</p>

<p>$$
1\,\mathrm{B/s} = 8\,\mathrm{b/s}
$$</p>

<p>Historically, the word “byte” was used to refer not to exactly 8 bits, but to the smallest addressable unit of memory in computers, or the size of one character. This is not different in practice, because 8 bits per byte is now essentially universal practice.</p>

<p>If one wants to be entirely unambiguous, the word ""octet"" refers to a unit of eight bits only. In some countries this is commonly used, giving abbreviations for data sizes like “Mo” instead of “MB”.</p>

<hr>

<p>As an example, let's combine the above two facts:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A data rate of 2 kilobytes per second is equal to 16 kilobits per second.</p></li>
<li><p>If we were to send this data using only two symbols, the symbol rate would be equal to the bit rate: 16 kilobaud.</p></li>
<li><p>If we were to send this data using 256-QAM, a modulation which has 256 distinct symbols (used for digital TV, for example), then each symbol encodes $\log_2{256} = 8$ bits, or one byte, meaning that the symbol rate is 2 kilobaud.</p></li>

"How do I discover APRS coverage?","2345","","<p>I'm considering adding simple APRS transmitters to my vehicles.  I'd rather just put one in and forget about it, but I understand there are areas of the US where a stronger transmitter would be required to successfully send an APRS update packet.</p>

<p>Are there coverage maps, similar to cell phone maps, which will help me understand where APRS should work and where it might not?</p>

<p>How powerful an APRS transmitter do I need to get approximately 75% coverage in the US?</p>
","<p>Coverage maps are a thing that is notoriously difficult to do right. There are some very complex programs (Radio Mobile is the one I know the most about) which can generate coverage maps if you're prepared to wade through the technical details and the quirks of the software. Unfortunately it's not as easy as drawing a circle of a certain size around each digipeater. Furthermore, power isn't the only factor - 5W vs 30W isn't going to make any difference at all compared to the night-and-day difference between an NMO-mounted mobile antenna vs an HT laying across your passenger seat. </p>

<p>You can use the <a href=""http://aprs.fi/heard/#!mt=roadmap&amp;z=7&amp;call=&amp;others=1&amp;timerange=86400&amp;tail=0"">aprs.fi maps</a> (warning: uses a google map overlay, it can be slow on some computers) to see all APRS activity. There's a button along the top right allowing you to filter out everything except APRS stations or digipeaters. You'll see that there are areas of very dense coverage - I'm looking right now at Baltimore, Philadelphia, up the NJ turnpike to NYC, and along the coast - but then there are wide areas that are empty, either because there are no digipeaters, or simply no one has sent a packet from there in the past 24 hours. An HT connected to a real mobile antenna, properly mounted on your vehicle, is equal to or better than 90% of the users you're seeing on that page, so if you use that setup you will get coverage anywhere that you see other users getting coverage on that page, with the possible exception of the outskirts of less heavily populated areas.</p>

<p>You could do better by using a 50W mobile, but even that is only a 10dB improvement and will only extend the coverage areas by a few more tens of miles, it will not magically give you coverage in the ""dead spots"" on that map. You also often do not want to run maximum power on something digital like APRS anyway unless it's a radio specifically intended for it - running ""at the limit"" can make your transmitted signal more dependent on the whims and quirks of the final amplifier, which can introduce nonlinearities which actually make your signal harder to decode. Plus, if you're signal is so powerful that digipeaters can hear you but you can't hear them, you risk stepping on signals that you can't hear, meaning that not only will you not get repeated, whoever you stepped on won't get repeated either.</p>

"What does the addition of a shield to a small loop accomplish?","2311","","<p>A small shielded loop is an antenna with a loop of wire, smaller than 1/10th of a wavelength in diameter, also surrounded by a shield. Often, they are constructed from coax. There is a gap in the shield somewhere. Feedpoint arrangements differ among implementations. Here's an example from the 1988 ARRL handbook:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/T61Wz.jpg"" alt=""shielded loop""></p>

<p>Such antennas are said to be quieter than ordinary small loops, and thus ideal for receiving, and popular for HF direction finding.</p>

<p>However, why? Why does the addition of a shield actually do, and why is it desirable?</p>
","<p>A ""shielded loop antenna"" is a very misleading name. It isn't an antenna, with a shield. It's an antenna made from a shield, with a feedline inside it.</p>

<p>It's commonly stated that the shield blocks electric fields and not magnetic fields. But that's false: it's <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/q/2455/218"">physically impossible</a>. That's not to say that a shielded loop antenna has no merit beyond an unshielded loop antenna, though. The ""shield"" makes an excellent, broad-band, low-loss, easily fabricated balun.</p>

<p>There's an <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/q/538/218"">analogous problem with dipoles</a> also. If we want to feed a dipole with coax, we need a balun to prevent common-mode currents on the feedline, because if there are common-mode currents on the feedline, the feedline is part of the antenna.</p>

<p>We could build a magnetic loop antenna like this:</p>



<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tBfrS.png"" alt=""schematic""></p>

<p>The feedline is balanced, and the antenna is symmetrical. Like a dipole with a balanced feeder, there are no common-mode currents and the feedline will not radiate, provided the surroundings are also reasonably symmetrical.</p>

<p>But we want a coax feedline.</p>

<p>There is only one place to connect the coax that won't result in common-mode currents: immediately opposite the feedpoint. If we do this, then any common-mode currents will cancel at the feedpoint. With any other arrangement, common-mode currents can couple into the feedpoint, so the feedline will be part of the antenna.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/d84DQ.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>But then how do we get the end of the coax to the feedpoint? The solution: make the antenna from tubing, and run the feedline <em>inside</em> the antenna. Because RF currents travel on the surface of the antenna, what happens inside the antenna is irrelevant to the operation of the antenna. Electrically, it looks like an ordinary loop antenna made from fat wire.</p>

Milligan</a> describes this as a <em>natural balun</em> (though, I've never seen that terminology used elsewhere):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A natural balun feeds the coax through a loop antenna to the feed point where the outer shield is split and the center conductor jumps the gap to connect to the outer shield of the coax. At this point the currents flow on to the outer shield and radiate. By moving an equal distance along the coax until the two halves meet, we can connect the feed coax and not have current flow down the outside. The currents flow in opposite directions along the loop and cancel at the connection. From a circuit point of view, the connection point is a virtual short circuit to the balanced mode <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/q/3591/218"">similar to a folded balun</a> at its connection point. In a similar manner, on a folded dipole we can connect the feed coax to the middle of the shorted dipole and form a natural balun.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we simplify the construction a bit and double the coax shield as the tubing, this type 2(d) from the question.</p>

<p>As it is, this design has a coax feed and no problems with common-mode currents. However, if one wants to add a capacitor to resonate the antenna at the operating frequency, or a matching network, one must be careful to preserve the current balance of the antenna. The ARRL design is notably horrible at this. However, we are getting away from the topic of the question, so I will suggest reading <a href=""http://www.w8ji.com/magnetic_receiving_loops.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">W8JI on small magnetic loops</a> for a more detailed discussion.</p>

<p>I see that the pinout for the 4-contact combined ""MIC/SP"" jack is known, though not in the manual, and there is a a first-party adapter cable (CT-44). However, this doesn't tell me without buying/building whether it's possible to use it in the way I want; specifically:</p>

<p><strong>If I connect only headphones to the FT-60, using an appropriately wired adapter, can I still use the <em>internal</em> microphone and PTT switch to transmit</strong>, or will just having a plug inserted cut out the internal mic?</p>

<p>(I haven't tested this out because I don't have a bare 4-contact plug to experiment, and I hear that plugging in headphones with a standard 3-contact plug results in misbehavior.)</p>
","<p>I've done some tests with what I have available (now including the CT-44 adapter).</p>

<p>With the MH-37A4B Earpiece/Microphone connected, the internal microphone can still be used: whichever mic has its PTT switch pressed will provide transmit audio and the other will not. Furthermore, the external microphone is open-circuit when its PTT is not pressed. Therefore, <strong>yes, given an appropriate adapter</strong> one can use headphones without a microphone plugged into the FT-60.</p>

<p>Connecting stereo headphones (64Ω impedance) into the jack directly did indeed result in misbehavior as reported elsewhere on the Internet, including a nonfunctional keypad or being stuck in transmit mode; presumably due to mis-connection of the mic line. Using an appropriately wired cable such as the CT-44 solves this problem, but produces mono (left channel only) audio since it has a mono jack.</p>

<p>Furthermore, loud thumps were heard when the radio is switched on or when it unmutes (due to an offset of 3 V DC when unmuted, 0 V when muted). These are also present but considerably milder on the internal speaker or earpiece accessory presumably due to their frequency response.</p>

<p>I have solved the above problems by building an adapter to stack onto the CT-44, which provides stereo audio and a blocking capacitor (which is an adequate but not ideal fix for the thumps). It could also be built together with a 4-pole plug and no CT-44, but the FT-60's 4-pole jack has slightly different dimensions than the standard smartphone-headset-style 4-pole plug and will not make proper contact with one.</p>

"How to reduce RF in the shack when using vertical HF antenna (no radials)","2243","","<p>What can be done to reduce RF in the shack (riding back along the coax) when using a vertical 10M antenna (without radials due to space constraints)? The antenna is an IMax-2000 at 32' elevation (20' over roof) with a 125' coax LMR-400, SWR is under 1.5 across 10M band. No balun, no tuner. Cable length is required to reach the shack room (basement). Max power 100 W with interference level increasing with greater power output.</p>

<p>This is causing interference with capacitive touch lamps (on, off on transmit); as well as causing speakers around the house (even when turned off) to broadcast the operator's voice (a ghoulish combination with the flickering lights).</p>

<p>The height of the mast was adjusted from 1' to its present 32' over ground level, with no change to SWR or interference as described above. The mast was tried with and without grounding (to an 8' ground rod at its base), no effect to SWR or interference level.</p>
","<p>You may be surprised to hear this, but the antenna you describe isn't <em>actually</em> a vertical, but a dipole. One half of the dipole is the IMax-2000, and the other half is your feedline.</p>

<p>You can not simply not have radials and still have an antenna. An antenna works by making EM fields between two things. A dipole has two halves. A vertical works because the ground plane under it creates an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_antenna"">image antenna</a> under it, making it appear as a dipole.</p>

<p>To get the RF currents off of the feedline, you have to give it some other place to go. You could:</p>

<ul>
<li>install a dipole</li>
<li>install elevated radials</li>
<li>mount the vertical on the ground</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also put a high impedance on the feedline to make that path less desirable to RF currents. An easy and effective way to do this is to slip ferrite beads over the coax. However, if you don't first provide a more desirable place for them to go, then you are just putting ferrite beads on your antenna, which will reduce the RF in the shack, and also everywhere else.</p>

<p>I would also point out that a SWR of 1.5:1 does not in itself indicate that the antenna is working well. SWR only indicates that that the antenna is decently matched to the feedline, and thus accepting (and not reflecting) power: it doesn't indicate that the power accepted is actually being radiated as intended. One way to make an antenna get a good match across a wide band is to make it very lossy. As an extreme example, I have a dummy load that has a 1:1 SWR from DC up to beyond the capability of my test equipment.</p>

<p>This would suggest that longer wavelength antennas are more efficient collectors of electromagnetic energy. Why is this? Wikipedia says it can be shown. Show me.</p>
","<p>This is a topic that troubles most students and even finds it way into many technical papers and textbooks in the form of incorrect assertions and conclusions. While you will find some reasonable references to thermodynamic equivalencies in some texts, it seems the genesis of the isotropic effective aperture equation has been rarely published.</p>

<p>The answer to the question lies buried in the mechanisms of Fresnel (near field) and Fraunhoffer (far field) zones of antennas. The Fresnel zone is the specific area of interest. The non-radiating, non-dissipating (thus reactive) part of the Fresnel zone is generally considered to extend 1∕(2π) times the wavelength from the surface of the antenna. In a more general sense, this is considered the maximum distance from which EM (electromagnetic) waves can couple to a nearby object. This coupling is why the energy is not radiated or dissipated by a transmitting antenna.</p>

<p>Now we turn our attention to the elusive isotropic antenna. It is considered a point source - small enough in dimension compared to any other incorporated dimensions that it is dimensionless and infinitesimally small. By definition, the isotropic antenna radiates equally in all directions. By the theory of reciprocity, the isotropic antenna must then receive equally in all directions. </p>

<p>Now consider an EM plane wave approaching the isotropic antenna. The isotropic antenna cannot ""look ahead"" and see the plane coming when the plane wave is in its far field because the EM plane wave is not yet having any effect on the isotropic antenna. But as the EM plane wave gets very close to the isotropic antenna, it begins to cause current to flow in the isotropic antenna. How close does the EM plane need to be? The distance of the non-radiating Fresnel zone which, as stated previously, is considered to be 1∕(2π) times the wavelength of the frequency in question.</p>

<p>As the plane wave intersects the isotropic antenna (that is, the isotropic point is on the plane), the spherical receiving pattern of the isotropic antenna has the maximum possible coupling with the EM plane wave. Since the isotropic antenna is a point lying on the intersecting plane with its receive sphere bisected by the plane, the resulting pattern is a circle defined by a radius that originates at the isotropic antenna and extends for a radius of 1∕(2π) times the wavelength. This circle is the A<sub>e</sub> (effective aperture) of the isotropic antenna. That is, it is generating current from EM waves within that radius.</p>

<p>But with any receiving antenna, we are more interested in determining the total power the receive antenna is able to make available to the receiver. This is a function of the radiative flux which is given in SI units of W/m<sup>2</sup>. While we do not know the radiative flux in this case, we can compute the normalize power received (the amount of power received if radiative flux = 1 watt/m<sup>2</sup>) by simply computing the area of the the A<sub>e</sub>. Since the aperture is a circle and the area of a circle is given by:</p>

<p>$$ A_\text{circle} = \pi r^2 $$</p>

<p>we can substitute the radius of the isotropic $A_e$:</p>

<p>$$ A_e = \pi \left({ \lambda \over 2 \pi}\right)^2 $$</p>

<p>and simplify:</p>

<p>$$ A_e = {\lambda^2 \over 4\pi} $$</p>

<p>Thus emerges the standard definition of the A<sub>e</sub> of an isotropic antenna, always with a gain of one. The dependency on λ<sup>2</sup> is simply due to the minimum radius at which the isotropic antenna (or any antenna for that matter) can begin to receive or emit EM waves.</p>

<p>If you now consider the effect of gain by any other type of antenna, you can see that it is simply increasing the area of the A<sub>e</sub> of the isotropic antenna by the magnitude of the gain. Since the A<sub>e</sub> is multiplied by the radiative flux and now the gain of the antenna, the received or transmitted power is scaled proportionally. It should be noted however, that the gain of an antenna does not physically extend the radius at which an EM wave can generate current in the antenna as this boundary condition is immutable. The gain and pattern of most amateur radio antennas is determined by the current vector patterns of the antenna.</p>

"SDR sampling bandwidth - do the bits per sample matter?","2172","","<p>I'm looking at data converter chips for a homebrew SDR design, and I see that I can choose not just the sampling frequency, but also the bits per sample.</p>

<p>Obviously the sampling frequency has to be several times the target frequency, but what effect does the bits per sample have on the signals I can receive and transmit?</p>

<p>Will I be ok with cheaper 8 bit ADC and DAC devices, or will I need to look at 10, 12, or 16 bit converters to experiment with SDR?</p>

<p>My primary concern is for HF usage with 200Msps converters and above, with sampling at the antenna, essentially, rather that downconverting, or mixing prior to the sampler.</p>
","<p>The bits per sample will affect the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">dynamic range</a> of your receiver.</p>

<p>There's a lot of math that I'm sure you can find, but here's the intuitive explanation:</p>

<p>A digital signal can represent only discrete quantities, where an analog signal can represent infinitely many quantities between any two discrete quantities the digital signal might represent. The difference between the actual analog signal, and the represented digital signal, is an error, and is called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantization_%28signal_processing%29#Quantization_noise_model"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">quantization noise</a>.</p>

<p>If you have more bits, the error, and the noise is less. Of course, if there are larger sources of noise (the preamplifier, ambient RF noise, etc) then the additional noise introduced by quantization doesn't matter.</p>

<p>Thus, it makes sense on as SDR to adjust the preamplifier's gain so that the noise floor is just above the quantization noise. Otherwise, you are wasting a lot of bits just carrying noise.</p>

<p>This maximizes the bits available for actual signal, which is good, because it also maximizes dynamic range, or how much power can be received by the receiver before it clips (the digital signal can represent a signal only so big). This is of particular concern for SDRs because of their wide receive bandwidth: you may not be listening to that guy with the S9+ signal, but your receiver is. If that signal is strong enough to hit the limits of your ADC, then you get clipping, which will introduce harmonics all over the band, making you unhappy. You could turn down the receiver's gain, but then the very weak DX station that is just above the RF noise floor will be below the quantization noise.</p>

<p>The resolution (number of bits) for the DAC is not really as critical, since you don't need a lot of dynamic range to transmit. You will still have quantization noise, but if the transmitter gain is set to use the full range of the DAC, that noise will be way, way below your transmitted signal.</p>

<p>So, 8 bits is more than sufficient for experimentation, but this is definitely a ""more is better"" situation. It all depends on the performance you require, and also your ability to build the rest of the receiver to utilize the full capabilities of the ADC.</p>

<hr>

<p>As mentioned by others in comments and answers, it is also possible to reduce the quantization noise by oversampling the signal of interest, then decimating the resulting data. For example, say we are interested in signals up to 30 MHz, so we require a 60 MHz ADC. If we use a 240 MHz ADC, but the analog input has no frequencies above 30 MHz, then we have four times more samples than required.</p>

<p>We could simply keep only 1 in 4 samples, but if we first use a digital low-pass filter we can actually remove some of the quantization noise. This is because the quantization noise will be distributed through the spectrum: from 0 to 120 MHz, the maximum at our 240 MHz sample rate. Low-pass filtering then removes the noise between 30 MHz (our upper range of interest) and 240 MHz, so we've effectively removed some of the noise by averaging it out.</p>

<p>The math works out so that for every 4x in excess samples, it effectively adds another bit to the resolution, or increases dynamic range by 3dB. For example, an 8-bit, 240 MHz ADC is equivalent to a 9-bit, 30 MHz ADC.</p>

"Can I improve reception with a more sensitive antenna / preamplifier / better feedline?","2164","","<p>I am trying to receive a station, but I can only barely hear it through the noise. Will doing anything that increases the signal from my antenna help, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>using a more sensitive antenna</li>
<li>adding a preamplifier</li>
<li>installing a shorter or higher quality feedline</li>
<li>improving SWR, thus reducing losses</li>
</ul>
","<p>These things will significantly help under one condition: the RF noise floor is below the receiver's noise floor. This is almost never the case on HF, where low-noise amplifiers are easy and atmospheric noise is high. On VHF and UHF the natural noise floor is lower, and low-noise receivers are more expensive, so it is possible but not guaranteed. It will depend on the quality of your receiver, and noise in that particular location and frequency. The 2.4 GHz ISM band, for example, is <em>full</em> of man-made noise.</p>

<p>Here's a simple test: compare the noise floor with a dummy load versus an antenna connected. If the noise floor is higher with the antenna connected, then the RF noise floor is higher than the receiver noise floor, and a more sensitive antenna will not significantly help. In this case you need to investigate ways of increasing the signal to noise ratio in other ways, such as by increasing transmitter power or installing directional antennas.</p>

<p>If we think of the radio's output as the combination of three components:</p>

<ol>
<li>The desired signal, free of any noise</li>
<li>RF noise received by the antenna. This could be atmospheric noise, interfering stations, or noise from electronics, powerlines, etc.</li>
<li>Noise generated internally by the receiver. That is, thermal noise in its resistors, its amplifiers, etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>We might think that the radio is contributing noise in all circumstances, and if we can boost the noise and signal from the antenna, then the radio's noise becomes relatively less significant, and SNR is improved. However, when the RF noise floor is above the receiver's noise floor, that improvement will be negligible.</p>

<p>The reason is that RF noise and the receiver's noise are <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncorrelated"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">uncorrelated</a>, like random white noise. As I will demonstrate, even if the RF noise is just a little above the receiver noise, because of the way uncorrelated noise adds, the receiver's noise will make very little contribution to the total noise. As such, there is very little to be gained by reducing the receiver's noise, or equivalently, making the antenna ""louder"".</p>

<h2>Orly? Show Me The Math.</h2>

<p>Uncorrelated noise powers simply add:</p>

<p>$$ P_1 + P_2 = P_\text{total} $$</p>

<p>But in this context our noise power is probably specified in dBm. To add these, we must first convert them to plain milliwatts (without the decibel), add, then convert back to dBm:</p>

<p>$$ 10 \log_{10}\left( 10^{P_\text{1(dBm)}/10} + 10^{P_\text{2(dBm)}/10} \right) = P_\text{total(dBm)} $$</p>

<p>So for example, if the receiver noise floor is -96 dBm and the RF noise floor is 6 dB above that (-90 dBm), then the total noise floor is effectively:</p>

<p>$$ 10 \log_{10}\left( 10^{-90\:\mathrm{dBm}/10} + 10^{-96\:\mathrm{dBm}/10} \right) = -89.03\:\mathrm{dBm} $$</p>

<p>So, the receiver's noise, which was only 6 dB below the RF noise, increased the total noise floor from -90 to -89.03, or by 0.97 dB. Not a terribly big deal.</p>

<p>An equivalent, and perhaps more intuitive way to think about it is this: uncorrelated noise amplitudes (that is, RMS voltage or current) add like orthogonal vectors:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XVrGc.png"" alt=""adding vectors""></p>

<p>Geometrically, we can see that as the RF noise becomes greater than the receiver noise, the triangle gets increasingly thin, and the total noise isn't much longer than the RF noise.</p>

<p>Mathematically, that's:</p>

<p>$$ E_\text{total} = \sqrt{E_1^2 + E_2^2} $$</p>

<p>And we can convert between dBm ($P_\text{dBm}$) and RMS volts ($E_\text{RMS}$), assuming a 50Ω impedance, with:</p>

<p>$$\begin{align}
 E_\text{RMS} &amp;= \sqrt{
  0.001\:\mathrm{W}
  \cdot 50 \:\Omega
  \cdot 10^{P_\text{dBm}/10}
}\\
&amp;= \sqrt{0.05\:\mathrm V^2} \cdot 10^{P_\text{dBm}/20} \\
&amp;\approx 0.2236\:\mathrm V \cdot 10^{P_\text{dBm}/20}
\end{align} $$</p>

<p>and:</p>

<p>$$ \begin{align}
P_\text{dBm} &amp;= 10 \log_{10}\left(
  E_\text{RMS}^2 / (0.001\:\mathrm W \cdot 50 \:\Omega)
\right)\\
&amp;= 20 \log_{10}(E_\text{RMS}) - 10 \log_{10}(0.05\:\mathrm V^2) \\
&amp;\approx 20 \log_{10}(E_\text{RMS}) + 13.01
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>One might still say that even this small improvement is an improvement, and is worth doing. However, there are two circumstances where that would be a bad idea:</p>

<p>Firstly, if you are increasing your antenna sensitivity by adding a preamplifier, this preamplifier will introduce noise of its own. Unless the preamplifier's <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_figure"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">noise figure</a> is lower than that of your receiver, or your receiver lacks sufficient gain to bring the RF noise floor above the receiver noise floor, then you are making things worse.</p>

<p>Secondly, increasing the signal+noise from the antenna by any means in many situations <em>decreases</em> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">dynamic range</a>. This is especially a concern with SDRs that are recently popular, because they have such a wide receive bandwidth. Consider that at some point, this signal in an SDR ends up at an analog to digital converter. Say it's a 16 bit converter. If the noise floor is high (because the antenna is so sensitive), then the least significant of these bits contain nothing but noise, and are essentially wasted. Furthermore, you approach overloading the converter and running into <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipping_(audio)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">clipping</a>.</p>

"How to calculate the peak-to-peak voltage of a sine wave given RMS voltage","2147","","<p>How do I calculate the peak-to-peak voltage of a sine wave given RMS voltage?</p>
","<h3>The short answer:</h3>

<p>\begin{equation}
\frac{V_{p-p}}{V_{rms}} = 2\sqrt{2}
\end{equation}</p>

<h3>The long answer, or how to derive the above:</h3>

<p>As noted on the Wikipedia page for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_mean_square"" rel=""nofollow"">root mean square</a>, the RMS of a sine wave is equal to its amplitude divided by the square root of two. (You can also derive this by doing the integral over a sine wave yourself.)</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
V_{rms} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{equation}</p>

<p>The peak-to-peak voltage is twice the amplitude of the wave, since it's measuring from the tip of a peak to the tip of a trough.</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
V_{p-p} = 2a
\end{equation}</p>

<p>We can rearrange these two equations:</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
V_{rms} \cdot \sqrt{2} = a
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
V_{p-p} = 2 \cdot (V_{rms} \cdot \sqrt{2})
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
V_{p-p} = V_{rms} \cdot 2\sqrt{2}
\end{equation}</p>

<p>Thus, we multiply the RMS voltage by twice the square root of two - a factor of about 2.828 or so:</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
2\sqrt{2} = 2.8284271247....
\end{equation}</p>

<p>Of course, the process also works in reverse - if you can measure the peak-to-peak voltage, dividing that by the same factor will give you the RMS voltage assuming a perfect sine wave.</p>

There appears to be no facility for attaching to station ground, unless one of the terminals in the 1/8th inch jack can be attached to a station ground.  It has USB/LSB single-sideband modes, as well as AM reception and pretty good general coverage from about 3200 khz up, in AM and SSB, plus commercial AM/FM and air-band coverage.</p>

Perhaps one of the pins on portable radios is also possibly the station ground pin? Does anybody ground their portable radios when using them for Shortwave listening?</p>

<li><p>That for a particular shortwave band, a dipole for that frequency will be resonant and will thus be ideal for receiving that band.</p></li>
<li><p>A coaxial feed, with the jacket of the coaxial feed attached to station ground will be good.</p></li>
<li><p>That it won't take long to figure out which terminal (pin) in the 1/8th-inch 3-pin connector is for the actual antenna.</p></li>

<p>b. What else can be done if I want to improve overall reception quality.</p>

<p>c. I intend to just experiment with wiring up the dipole to the two pins on the headphone jack but I have no idea if the little portable radio is likely to even have both pins connected inside the radio.</p>

<p>Has anyone ever made their own antennas for little portable AA battery receivers like the Tecsuns (or Grundigs or other similar units)?</p>
","<p>Receiving is all about signal to noise ratio. If most of the noise is generated outside of the receiver (as it is on most HF bands) then matching the antenna system to the receiver increases the signal and the noise by the same amount so you have no change in the signal to noise ratio. Thats why the mismatched random wire works so well on HF receivers and impedance match is not so important in that case. </p>

<p>VHF/UHF is a different story because the majority of the noise is usually generated by the internal receiver circuits. In that case matching the antenna system to the receiver input impedance does make a difference because it increases the signal without causing a corresponding increase in noise so the signal to noise ratio improves and you copy better.</p>

When I hear stations respond, they seem to do so with a specific set of information. I recognize the call sign and a signal report but there are often other pieces of information that seem to be standard that I don't recognize. When I hear a CQ contest call I am not sure how to respond.</p>
","<p>A ""CQ Contest"" is simply a limited CQ, just like someone can call CQ some-specific-area or CQ any-member-of-a-particular-club. I don't think I've heard this variant on SSB, but I imagine in some contests it may be beneficial to actually specify the contest in question.</p>

<p>During a contest, there is usually a specific set of information to exchange. <strong>The exact information to be exchanged varies with the contest.</strong> This can be <em>for example</em> a serial number, signal report, Maidenhead locator, state/province/county/etc. (usually according to some sort of list of codes), or almost anything else, or a combination of several of these.</p>

<p>In order to participate, <strong>you must know what the specific exchange is for the contest that the other station is calling CQ for.</strong> <em>If you don't know what the exchange is and what yours should be, don't respond to a CQ Contest call.</em> The only exception I can think of is if the remote station is calling repeatedly but not getting any answer; in that case, you might respond with something brief like ""W9ABCD, ABC1DE what's the exchange?"", substituting the correct call signs. If it's simply a serial number (or something similar that you know right away) and signal report, you can jump right in and figure out later where to send the logs. Don't ask such a question on the air if the remote station is working stations; you almost certainly <em>will</em> annoy everyone involved. If the exchange is only a signal report and a serial number, by listening to a few exchanges you should be able to figure that out quickly enough; if it's anything much more involved you'll probably need to look it up somewhere anyway. If the remote station is weak, it may be beneficial to listen to a few exchanges anyway in order to establish the remote station's transmitted exchange before you try to contact it yourself.</p>

<p>A contest QSO is just like any other QSO, only in fast-forward mode. A typical phone contest QSO might go something like this:</p>

<p>W9ABCD transmits: <em>W9ABCD CQ contest</em><br>
N5EFGH transmits: <em>N5EFGH</em><br>
W9ABCD transmits: <em>N5EFGH five-nine, one-four-zero</em><br>
N5EFGH transmits: <em>Five-nine, zero-one-eight</em><br>
W9ABCD transmits: <em>Roger, contest</em><br>
...at which point some other station hopefully responds to W9ABCD, and N5EFGH writes down the QSO in the log and moves on to work the next one. Working a contest by scanning the bands and working stations encountered is called <em>search and pounce,</em> by the way. By only giving the absolute bare necessities, a strong-signal contact can be over in a few seconds.</p>

<p>Note that to save time, the signal report for any audible contest signal is usually 59 (or 599 on CW and digital modes). That means that you'll normally only need to write down the exchange received (since you know your own transmitted exchange).</p>

<p>On non-phone modes, the exact traffic will obviously differ slightly from the above example, but the general idea remains the same: getting the particular contest's exchange well, <em>exchanged,</em> as quickly and efficiently as possible.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1b0KM.jpg"" alt=""loopstick antenna photo""></p>

<p>This particular example is actually two antennas on one core.</p>

<p>What type of material is an appropriate core for these antennas? What material parameters are relevant in the selection of an appropriate core, and how do they affect antenna performance?</p>
","<p>As it's name implies, a loopstick antenna is a magnetic loop antenna and is one of the best choices for an electrically short antenna; necessary because broadcast AM wavelengths are hundreds of meters long.</p>

<p>Rather than a regular loop, a loopstick utilizes a large amount of (usually <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litz_wire"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Litz</a>) wire wrapped around a ferrite rod.  This forms an inductor which is tuned to resonance by a variable capacitor as the radio is tuned to a frequency. </p>

<p>The material for the core of these antennas is ferrite -- a powdered iron based magnetic material with a variety of other metals added. The exact composition of the ferrite material (called it's ""mix"") governs it's characteristics.</p>

<p>The goal of the ferrite is to produce a very high Q inductor with a high electrical resistance.  The efficiency of the inductor is governed by the permeability of the ferrite core and the core's permeability changes with frequency.</p>

<p>This is because the ferrite itself absorbs power. This arises from the energy required to change the magnetic alignment of the magnetic domains inside the granular structure of the ferrite. The higher the frequency, the greater the number of changes and hence the higher the loss, generally dropping off sharply.  See the following chart (lifted from the Fair-Rite catalog) for example:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/95A4l.gif"" alt=""Fair-Rite Mix 61 Perm""></p>

<p>In the chart, μ' is the permeability of the ferrite and μ"" is the ferrite induced losses. While the permeability continues to rise until about 11 MHz, the loses begin to rise dramatically starting at about 4.5MHz.  This is why <a href=""http://www.fair-rite.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Fair-Rite Corp</a> only recommends this mix through about 5MHz.</p>

<p>This is a chart of their ""mix 61"", which uses Nickel and Zinc in the iron to achieve it's characteristics and is recommended as the proper one for AM broadcast frequency antenna material.  </p>

<p>For HF frequencies, they recommend ""mix 73"", a combination of Nickel and Manganese which performs well up to about 50MHz as shown here:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NNLdk.png"" alt=""Fair-Rite Mix 73""></p>

<p>It's worth noting in this chart that the losses are much higher than the MF band material, but so is the permeability.</p>

<p>This is probably a good time to underline an important characteristic of ferrite: while it concentrates the magnetic fields, it has a very high electrical resistance.  This isn't very important for receiving.  But the use of ferrite in a transmitting antenna, or as is more common among hams, as a transformer in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balun"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">baluns</a> or ununs, it can be important.</p>

<p>Ferrite's resistance is inversely related to it's permeability.  The less permeable ferrite becomes, the more resistant it becomes.  Ferrite's permeability is also affected by temperature.  As the ferrite warms up, it's permeability increases until it reaches what's called it's <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curie_temperature"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Curie temperature</a>, for this mix, about 160° C.  At that point ferrite rapidly loses it's permeability as shown in this graph:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zQ0YK.png"" alt=""Mix 73 curie temp graph""></p>

<p>And this is how <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balun"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">baluns</a> and ununs fail.  Power through the transformer warms the material due to the ferrite related loses.  All is OK until the curie temperature it reached and then the permeability falls off a cliff and the resistance <strong>increases</strong> causing more heating in a runaway thermal loop until your coax melts and shorts the inner conductor to the shield.</p>

"If I install a G5RV in my attic how could I be certain there are not harmful levels of RF in the shack, or my kids bedroom?","2089","","<p>I assume that anyone who has a G5RV or G5RV junior in their attic has done so with ceramic spacers, and has zigzag or dog-leg installations, or otherwise has contorted the antenna to fit up there.</p>

<p>My worry is how can I satisfy my own and my XYL (wife)'s concerns about RF in our house, especially in the bedrooms immediately below the attic, where all of us sleep?</p>

<p>What do I need to know, and what do I need to measure to know if any harmful RF levels would exist in the area 12 feet below the attic?</p>

<p>Assuming that other questions here cover using radios or Oscilliscopes to measure and observe decreases in RF in the shack, how can I establish reasonably easily that levels not more than 1/10th of the level that could cause harm, are present in my house?</p>

<p>For example, if high levels can cause GFCI breakers in my outlets to trip, how high would such levels be, compared to the levels that could cause damage to people?  Is there any way to know?</p>
","<p>If you want to be <em>certain</em>, you will need calibrated electric and magnetic field probes and a spectrum analyzer. If you had that equipment, I doubt you would ask this question, so let's assume you <em>don't</em> have it, and you don't care to drop thousands of dollars to get it. How can you be <em>pretty sure</em> that exposure is safe, without expensive test equipment?</p>

<p>First we have to define <em>safe</em>. Since this forum is about Amateur Radio, and not medical research, let's use the FCC's definition of safe.</p>

<p>The FCC has determined that amateur operators need not give any special consideration to RF safety if the transmitter power is below a certain level. At these relatively low transmitter powers, it's just really hard to encounter a dangerous field, no matter how close you get. <a href=""http://www.arrl.org/fcc-rf-exposure-regulations-the-station-evaluation"">The ARRL gives a full table</a>, but all bands 15m and below are good at 100W PEP or less (limits are even higher on lower bands). The limit for 12m is 75W, and 10m is 50W PEP. That covers the usual operating range for a G5RV.</p>

<p>If you exceed those limits, you may very will still be safe, but you have to do some analysis. Here's a simple way to do it: the maximum power density for 3MHz to 30MHz is 180mW per square centimeter, divided by the frequency in MHz squared.</p>

<p>We can estimate the power density by making some simplifying assumptions. If we leave a big margin, we can still be pretty sure we are within safe limits despite our gross simplifications. First, let's assume that power is radiated equally along the antenna's length, and that you are close enough that we should consider it as a line source, not a point source. If you put 100W into it, then for any cylinder centered on that antenna, there is 100W passing through it.</p>

<p>The half-size G5RV, being smaller, will have higher power density. It's 15.5m long. Let's say you are 3m away from it, and you are feeding it with 100W. The area of a cylinder (without the ends) 15.5m in length and 3m in radius is:</p>

<p>$$ 2 \pi \cdot 3\mathrm m \cdot 15.5m = 292 \mathrm m^2 $$</p>

<p>Your 100W of transmitter power is spread over this cylinder, so the power density is:</p>

<p>$$ \require{cancel}
\frac{100\cancel{\mathrm W}}{292 \cancel{\mathrm m^2}}
\frac{1 \cancel{\mathrm m}}{100 \mathrm{cm}}
\frac{1 \cancel{\mathrm m}}{100 \mathrm{cm}}
\frac{1000\mathrm{mW}}{1\cancel{\mathrm W}}
= 0.0342 \mathrm{mW}/\mathrm{cm} $$</p>

<p>Let's call the top end of 10m an even 30MHz. The maximum safe power density is:</p>

<p>$$ \frac{180}{30^2} = 0.2\mathrm{mW}/\mathrm{cm}^2 $$</p>

<p>So, you are 7.6dB below the FCC limit for uncontrolled exposure. I'd call it safe.</p>

<p>Remember that this is a gross simplification. Factors that make our estimation less safe include:</p>

<ul>
<li>power isn't actually radiated equally all over the antenna. There will be hot spots, and cold spots.</li>
<li>with the antenna in your attic, you aren't even in the far field of the antenna. Calculating the actual fields is really hard.</li>
<li>ground reflections, and also any wiring in your house, may reflect, distort, or focus the field, making more hot spots.</li>
</ul>

<p>Factors that provide additional safety margin to our estimate include:</p>

<ul>
<li>the antenna doesn't radiate like the worst-case cylinder: some power goes towards the sides also.</li>
<li>exposure limits are higher for lower frequencies (at 7 MHz: 3.6 milliwatt per square centimeter).</li>
<li>SSB power is usually measured in PEP, while exposure limits are set by average power over 30 minutes. SSB has a duty cycle around 20%.</li>
<li>Regardless of the mode you use, you probably don't transmit all the time, further reducing duty cycle.</li>

"How to choose the right sampling rate and bandwidth for RTL-SDR dongle?","2081","","<p>Receiving the frequency of 97.9 MHz</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YDsiy.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YDsiy.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I have a Terratec SDR dongle and I am trying to capture a radio frequency. The FFT window shows the frequency range from -500 to 500 KHz. Is there a way to increase this or it depends on the dongle and is fixed? Does it depend on the sampling rate?</p>
","<p>What the FFT sink shows as frequency axis actually has no basis in ""real world signal"" – it just takes the sample rate you set (here, you set 1 MHz), and scales the full nyquist bandwidth to that. If you used a different number in the sample rate field of the FFT sink, the spectrum would look absolutely the same, just the frequency axis would have different labels!</p>

<p>It's important to understand that in DSP (and in GNU Radio especially), things are always only handled with respect to samples – e.g. a sine with a period of three samples would have frequency $\frac13$, no unit. The spike on the FFT plot would be at $2 \cdot \frac 13= \frac23$ of the axis (factor of two: your Nyquist zone is from $-\frac{f_\text{sample}}{2}$ to $+\frac{f_\text{sample}}{2}$).</p>

<p>Here's an example to illustrate:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AafuU.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AafuU.png"" alt=""relative frequencies""></a></p>

<p>How that $\frac 13$ relates to real world frequencies is defined by the sampling rate of the analog-to-digital (or digital-to-analog, in TX) converter.</p>

<p>So if you need to increase the observed bandwidth, you need to increase the sampling rate at the dongle! They are identical for complex sampling, like the direct-conversion receiver that the RTL dongle is does. For real-valued sampling, your bandwidth is half the sampling rate.</p>

<p>The RTL dongles support multiple sampling rates. You should simply try – for example, 2 MS/s should work with most dongles. </p>

"Is there an optimum Antenna Feedline Length for mobile installations?","2058","","<p>I bought a ham radio antenna mounting kit for my car that includes ~16' of coax. One end has a trunk lip NMO antenna mount, the other end has a re-solderable PL-259.</p>

<p>I asked the sales person if it is best to shorten the coax after installation to only the length required to reach the radio transceiver and they said ""I would just leave it, the length is already optimized for maximum efficiency at the factory"".</p>

<p>I've heard of this before (mostly from CB Radio installers) but don't actually know if this is true or understand <strong>why/if there is an optimum feedline length for VHF/UHF FM use</strong> (vs Citizen's Band AM HF). I intend to be setup for both VHF/UHF but will operate primarily on 2M VHF and so any trade-offs should be optimized for the 2M band.</p>

<p>My SWR on 2M at my club's repeater frequency is 1.7. Would shortening the length change the SWR or only change the losses incurred due to the SWR?</p>

<p>I have a nice space in the trunk, normally used for a sub-woofer if you purchased an optional ""premium stereo"" with the car - in my case this space sits empty. I plan to keep the radio transceiver body in the trunk with the remote head unit up front. This would allow me to keep the antenna feedline shorter and make for an aesthetically clean installation. This would also allow the antenna feedline length to be something around 5-6ft if shortening it would be beneficial (although I could just coil up the unused ~10ft or so).</p>
","<p>In the absence of common-mode currents, then the optimum feedline length is 0, because a longer feedline only increases your feedline losses. These losses are due to the resistance of the wire, dielectric losses, etc. and are specified in dB per unit length in the coax datasheet. At VHF and up, these losses can be significant even at car lengths, especially with less expensive or smaller feedline.</p>

<p>When you do have <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/q/1271/218"">common-mode currents</a>, then the feedline is effectively part of the antenna. Changing its length does the same thing as changing the length of the antenna: it can alter the radiation efficiency and impedance (and thus SWR) of the antenna. Even in this case, it's hard to say just what the ""optimum length"" is, because feedlines tend to be routed to, around, or near other conductive objects (like the radio chassis, and through the negative power supply lead, the car body), and these too will alter the operation of the antenna.</p>

<p>There's nothing special about CB: it's still just radio, and a properly designed and installed station still has no significant common-mode currents, and the feedline should still be a short as possible. The issue is that CB operators have more interest in superstition than a proper understanding of RF engineering. A popular CB antenna is a vertical which is installed with no ground plane, or an insufficient ground plane. In this case, <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/q/601/218"">the feedline acts like the missing half of the dipole</a>, so the feedline length absolutely is essential to the operation of the antenna. While you can indeed ""tune"" your ""antenna"" in this case by altering the feedline length, this is usually <em>bad advice</em>. <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/q/538/218"">Addressing the common-mode current problem</a>, rather than fiddling with feedline length until you happen to get a good antenna, usually yields a more robust and predictable result.</p>

"What causes ground losses in a HF antenna system?","2041","","<p>This applies to mobile and fixed installations. What are ground losses, and how can they be minimized? It seems to involve proximity to the ground, but what is the mechanism that causes loss? Does antenna installation height influence ground loss in any way?</p>
","<p>To add to what Dan is saying, for (horizontal) <em>dipole</em> antennas, ground height is important because although a dipole doesn't require ground to work, ground is still a (lossy) conductive plane, and you still get an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_antenna"" rel=""noreferrer"">image</a>. That is, it appears that there's another dipole, fed in anti-phase, underground. Even if nothing in your transmitter or antenna is connected to the ground, your antenna will be capacitively coupled to the ground. There is no avoiding it.</p>

<p>If the dipole is close to the ground, then the currents in the ground can be quite strong, incurring significant resistive losses along the way. You could put radials (or any conductive mesh, really) in the ground to mitigate this.</p>

<p>But also: this image makes your dipole a kind of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phased_array"" rel=""noreferrer"">phased array</a>. Depending on the spacing of the antenna and it's image, this might make a phased array that helpfully directs most of the RF energy at the horizon (low takeoff angle, desirable for HF DX exploiting <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skywave"" rel=""noreferrer"">skywave</a> propagation), or unhelpfully straight up (useless, unless you are trying to exploit <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_Vertical_Incidence_Skywave"" rel=""noreferrer"">NVIS</a> propagation on communicate with something in space).</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.vias.org/radioanteng/radio_antenna_engineering_03_06_02.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>Radio Antenna Engineering</em> has a more detailed explanation</a>, and this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LJuCI.png"" alt=""radiation patterns for dipoles over ideal ground planes""></p>

<p>One interesting thing to note about this image: you can't get maximum gain in <em>any</em> direction until the dipole is $0.25\lambda$ high. Remember, the image is twice this distance away, and anti-phase. Below this height, in any direction you will get at least partial phase-cancellation. At $h=0.25\lambda$, you have two antennas, in anti-phase, $0.5\lambda$ apart, which makes the <em>add</em> instead of <em>cancel</em>, but only if you are directly over the antenna, which isn't useful for skywave propagation. Thus, the general recommendation to get a dipole something like $0.5\lambda$ high, which sends <em>most</em> of the energy at a reasonably low take-off angle, making the best of the transmit power available.</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure that by ""SWL"" they mean unlicensed/public access, but I'm not entirely sure, as I've read in several forum threads that it isn't appreciated when you connect to an repeater/node and don't identify or say something. I suppose this is because the EchoLink system announces when a remote user connects through the system, but doesn't necessarily announce the call of the connected station.  </p>

<p>So is there any reason why I shouldn't use EchoLink to ""just listen""? Or is this just a misconception/misunderstanding on my part?</p>

  <p>No ""SWL"" (listen-only) access is permitted.  EchoLink is a two-way system by design, and <strong><em>there is no mechanism to validate listen-only stations</em></strong>.</p>

<p>The last part is key.  You can't use the echo link system without being a validated licensed amateur.  You logistically can not listen to this system without also being allowed to talk on it.  Contrast that with ""traditional"" short wave listeners.  Anyone can buy a radio and listen without being licensed to talk on it and there is no way technologically that you can prevent them from listening.</p>

<p>I don't think that they mean that you aren't allowed to connect and not talk.  I hear stations connect to nodes regularly without saying anything.  </p>

<p>Perhaps the policy would be clearer if it were written this way:</p>

"How is a 1:1 current balun different from a choke?","2033","","<p>I have a 10m dipole and am going to feed it with 50 ohm unbalanced feed line (coax).  My understanding is the feed point of this style antenna is about 50-75 ohms and since it is a balanced antenna I'm thinking I need some type of balun.  I'm wondering, is a 1:1 current balun the same as a choke?  Are they the exact same devices internally or are they different internally and just preform the same function?  If they are different, do they both keep common mode current off the feed line?  If they are the same, why are there two different names?</p>
","<p>Baluns are designed to be transformers (like 1:1 4:1, 6:1, etc.) or choke baluns, and both.</p>

<p>For an antenna, the purpose of a choke balun is to create a high-impedance to common mode currents that would flow on the outside of coaxial cable shielding.  These common mode currents can cause all kinds of problems such as RF in the shack, matching problems, and others.  So, minimizing common mode currents is a good thing.</p>

<p>Common mode currents arise when you are coupling a balanced antenna to an unbalanced line (usually).  For example, connecting coax cable to a dipole antenna.  You can use either a 1:1 balun or a choke balun at the feed point of the antenna or where the balanced part of the system meets the unbalanced part.  The choke balun usually does the same thing as a regular 1:1 current balun but adds the high impedance path to the common mode currents too.  </p>

<p>Also, the names Choke Balun and regular current balun are somewhat interchangeable as both are used to do the same thing in ham radio
antenna matching: matching coax to balanced antenna and minimizing common mode currents.</p>

<p>Currently, on my 80-meter dipole, I run 450 ohm ladder line to a 4:1 Current Balun and the remaining 20 feet or so is coax into the shack.  In this application, I experimented with both a 4:1 and a 1:1 balun to find the best match and overall SWR on my bands of choice I use with this antenna: 80, 40, 30.</p>

<p>With the same antenna, I have used my own custom made choke balun made from coax turns through 6 toroids -- about 7 turns of coax through all 6 toroids.  This worked very effectively except for one thing.  This balun was heavy and often would be a factor in my antenna coming down in a wind storm so I replaced it.</p>

<p>So, in answer to your question specifics: (1) they do not always perform the same function but sometimes they do; (2) A regular current balun internally is very much like a transformer where as a choke balun usually focuses on multiple turns through toroids to provide high-impedance to common mode currents; (3) the names are different and some people distinguish between one thing and another by the names and others do not.  It is usually not a big deal from my experience unless you are buying something but then you look at the data sheet to understand the balun better.</p>

<p>The image below is of one of my custom made choke baluns.  This is an older one that used only five toroids.</p>

<p>The bandwidth must be amazing here; maybe someone could make something like wifi but faster!</p>

<p>How is it even possible to make the electronic circuits operate at these frequencies?</p>
","<p>Occasionally you'll find <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=ehf%20transmitter"" rel=""nofollow"">researchers and amateur radio enthusiasts who have created transmitters and receivers that operate in the EHF band</a>.  This band goes from 30GHz to 300GHz, and covers the frequencies you are interested in.</p>

<p>At these frequencies, conventional electronics and oscillators aren't very useful, and typically oscillators are built by using resonant cavities.  This is akin to a pipe organ, but at radio frequencies.  One example is the magnetron in the typical microwave oven - while it operates at a much lower frequency, it uses the same principle.  At higher frequencies you might use a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klystron"" rel=""nofollow"">Klystron</a>, which is a special tube that contains the parts needed to create an EHF oscillator while controlling the amplitude, frequency and phase.  The Klystron may be used as the antenna itself as well, directing what you might consider a microwave beam of radio energy, or the energy might be coupled into suitable coaxial cables as in a typical radio setup.  The Klystron and Magnetron technically operate on different principles, but they are both examples of ways to generate EHF waves.</p>

<p>Note that the next band up, running from 300GHz to 3,000GHz, referred to as terahertz, is the same band that newer airport scanners run at, imaging human bodies below their clothing.  Many frequencies in EHF and THF bands will not travel very far through many materials, and so aren't very useful for general radio use.  But there are specialized uses where these frequencies are used, such as airport security scanners and particle accelerators.</p>

<p>If you are looking for faster wifi, keep in mind that we haven't fully exploited the spectrum we're already using.  MIMO is being used to double and triple throughput, for instance.  Channel bonding and wider channels are being used it increase throughput.  Going another 10 GHz higher isn't going to buy us much with our current technology, but will further limit transmission range and penetration.  </p>

<p>How's it work?</p>
","<p>It's easier to see what's going on with a bit of rearrangement. Imagine this built of tubing:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5UJjq.png"" alt=""antenna and balun of tubing""></p>

<p>The feedpoint is still where it would be on a dipole without the balun. The feedpoint sees the dipole as usual (blue).</p>

<p>In parallel with that is a twin-lead transmission line formed by the two parallel sections of the balun (red). This is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarter-wave_impedance_transformer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">quarter-wave section</a> with a short at the end, so it looks like an infinite impedance. An infinite impedance in parallel with the dipole at the feedpoint doesn't change the impedance the feedpoint sees. The red section might as well not be there at all.</p>

<p>Then, there's this green stub on the bottom. It's insignificant to the operation of the antenna because there can be no currents on it. Although there may be currents of the balun (red section), they are equal and opposite, and so at the point where the green stub is, they cancel. So you can't drive a current on the green stub via the feedpoint. Furthermore, because the green stub is symmetrical with respect to the dipole, it will have equal capacitance to either half of the dipole, and so you can't drive a current on the green stub capacitively, either.</p>

<p>So there's no way to drive a current on the green stub via the feedpoint. That sounds like exactly what we want in a balun, if the green stub is the coax shield. Trouble is, the feedpoint is up there at the top. How can the shield be connected at the bottom while the feedpoint is at the top? Easy, if it's made from tubing. Just cut a little hole near the feedpoint, and run the feedline inside the tubing. The shield is connected to one half of the dipole at the hole, and the center conductor goes through the hole to feed the other side:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tJPhf.png"" alt=""with feedline inside""></p>

<p>This is equivalent to the more usual construction:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fgNn1.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>This uses the coax as the tubing, and since the spacing between the balun halves is usually very small (assuming coax diameters far smaller than the wavelength), not exiting exactly in the center has a negligible impact on performance.</p>

<p>By running the feedline ""inside"" the antenna and balun, we have the option of connecting the shield in a location where there can be no common mode current, while connecting the feedpoint somewhere else.

<p>However, the radiation pattern is different, because now it's not a 1/2 wavelength dipole, but a 1 1/2 wavelength dipole. The radiation pattern looks like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2q6VZ.jpg"" alt=""1.5 WL antenna pattern""></p>

<p>In the latter case, at 435 MHz, the maximum gain is the same as it was at 145 MHz. However, the lobes are narrower, and higher elevation. There's a secondary lobe around the horizon, but it's even narrower, and about 4 dB below the main lobes.</p>

","<p>The emission type specifier is made up of several fields, which are defined as follows.</p>

<p>First comes an (optional) specifier of the necessary radio bandwidth. This is four characters, mixed letters and numbers, with one of <code>H</code> (Hz), <code>K</code> (kHz), <code>M</code> (MHz) or <code>G</code> (GHz) where the decimal point would be. For example, <code>400H</code> specifies a bandwidth of 400 Hz, <code>2K40</code> specifies 2.40 kHz, <code>25K0</code> specifies 25.0 kHz and <code>6M00</code> specifies 6.00 MHz. This is the bandwidth used by the signal on the air, not the modulation bandwidth. For example, narrow-band FM modulated with a 3 kHz signal would be <code>12K5</code> because it needs 12.5 kHz of bandwidth on the air.</p>

<p>This is followed by three characters which specify, in turn, the modulation type, the nature of the modulating signal, and the type of information carried.</p>

<li><code>9</code> = Composite modulating signal, one or more analog channels plus one or more digital channels</li>
<li><code>X</code> = all other cases</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Type of information carried by the modulating signal</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><code>A</code> = aural telegraphy, for people (generally Morse code)</li>
<li><code>B</code> = telegraphy for machine copying (generally RTTY or high-speed Morse code)</li>

"Decoding the Morse code","1923","","<p>I am using a crystal to transmit morse codes, and I am using Kenwood radio receiver to obtain the signal. It receives the signal with a lot of noise, though we can figure out the morse code sound. I want to convert this signal into a series of 0s and 1s so that i can use a code to convert the signal to human readable text.</p>

<p>Can someone please help, or should I use some other alternative to convert the noisy morse code sound file into decoded text file, please suggest.</p>

<p>NOTE:- I do want to know the steps behind, so that i can write the code myself.</p>
","<h2>If you would like to decode Morse code with an existing program:</h2>

<p>My personal recommendation is <a href=""http://www.w1hkj.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Fldigi</a>, which is a software modem that runs on most major operating systems, including Windows and Linux. Fldigi has a modem for ""CW"" (Continuous Wave), which can both send and receive Morse code. The program uses your sound card to communicate with your radio. To receive and decode Morse code, you would connect your receiver's audio output to your computer's microphone port. Then Fldigi will be able to listen to the Morse code sounds and can decode the transmission for you.</p>

<h2>If you would like to write your own program to decode Morse code:</h2>

<p>You will need to read about some digital signal processing techniques to do this. Ultimately there are a few different ways to approach the problem. Let's assume you already have some way of getting audio from your receiver into your computer (maybe you have pre-recorded some transmission and saved it to disk, or maybe you are doing this in real time by reading sound input data).</p>

<p>Your first goal is to implement some kind of algorithm to detect the presence or absence of the carrier frequency (which is being turned off and on in order to send Morse code). You should learn about something called the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT); <a href=""https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/st/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this online textbook</a> is a lot of material, but if you are interested in digital signal processing and working with radio or audio signals on your computer, you will get a lot out of it.</p>

<p>A simple explanation of the DFT is that it takes a sequence of audio samples and tells you the amplitude (and phase) of certain frequencies of your signal. For your application, you can calculate the DFT over your sample buffer and then look for the output value that corresponds to the frequency of the Morse code tone. If the value corresponds to a large amplitude then you know the carrier frequency was present in your sample. If the value you see corresponds to a small amplitude then the carrier was not present. This will allow you to detect the Morse code sound.</p>

<p>A simpler way to do this is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goertzel_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Goertzel algorithm</a>. The Goertzel algorithm is essentially a single tone detector. It calculates only one frequency component of the DFT. If you know ahead of time what the audio frequency of your Morse code tone will be, you can implement a Goertzel filter that will detect the presence or absence of that tone (as illustrated in <a href=""http://www.embedded.com/design/real-world-applications/4401754/Single-tone-detection-with-the-Goertzel-algorithm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this white paper</a>). However this is a more advanced way to do it, although it is more efficient.</p>

<p>Once you have detected the presence or absence of the Morse code sound, you will need an algorithm to figure out whether a dot or a dash is being sent. One algorithm to do this is that used by the <a href=""http://wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl/~ptdeboer/ham/rscw/algorithm.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RSCW program</a>. The disadvantage of this algorithm is that it does not tolerate poorly sent code. It will do well when detecting Morse code that is sent by a machine, but humans cannot send with perfect timing and so this algorithm may not do well. However it is a place to start and maybe you will think of some ways to improve it, or come up with something yourself depending on the results you get from the carrier detection step.</p>

<p>Writing a Morse decoder from scratch is challenging, especially if you have never done digital signal processing before. However it is a rewarding experience and will teach you a lot about DSP and integrating software with radio. If you have some programming experience, you should not have any trouble finding libraries for audio input and DFT in your favourite language.</p>

"What is the purpose of a balun and a unun in a feed line?","1921","","<p>I have never understood how a balun or a unun works and under which situation I need to use either of them in an antenna feed line. </p>
","<p>A balun matches a balanced load to an unbalanced line, but it can also do other useful things. A current balun can present a high impedance to common-mode signals, which will help reject noise. Common mode signals are the same on both conductors, so are not ""balanced"" or differential.</p>

<p>An unun is an impedance transformer, usually 4:1 or 9:1, which matches an unbalanced antenna to a feedline. A 9:1 transformer is often used for an end-fed half wave antenna.</p>

The common name is a bit misleading, since it's old - at the time of the design, UHF referred to frequencies above 30 MHz, and by today's standards UHF is 300 MHz to 3 GHz. <a href=""http://www.qsl.net/vk3jeg/pl259tst.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">This measurement</a> shows 0.2 db insertion loss at 144 MHz and 1 db insertion loss at 432 MHz, and with low-quality connectors (or higher frequency such as 2.4 GHz) it would be worse.

"What is a link budget, and how do I make one?","1870","","<p>Like the question title says, what is a radio link budget? For what is it useful, and how do I make one?</p>
","<p>A link budget is a summary of a communications link that tries to take into account all factors which have an impact on the received signal strength. It is often used to determine the minimum amount of output power required at the transmitter for a given signal strength at the receiver, and takes into consideration power output, antenna gains, propagation losses, acceptable signal fading, and other factors (for example, for long cable runs, cable attenuation may be a factor, and at microwave frequencies, losses due to absorption in atmospheric gases become a significant factor for Earth-bound links).</p>

<p>A few elementary values are required to make up a link budget. For unobstructed line of sight communications, which is the primary propagation mode on VHF and up, propagation losses can be estimated using the formula</p>

<p>$$L_{p} = -22 - 20\log{\frac{r}{λ}}$$</p>

<p>Where <em>r</em> is the distance covered and <em>λ</em> is the wavelength of the operating frequency. When the two use the same units (for example, meters), <em>Lp</em> comes out in dB and expresses the propagation attenuation (loss) between two isotropic antennas. For example, the propagation loss for a distance of 100 meters at 450 MHz is approximately 65.5 dB. Note that the determining factor is actually the distance in terms of wavelengths between the two antennas, so the loss goes up by 6 dB for every doubling of either the physical distance or the frequency (halving of the wavelength).</p>

<p>No antenna is perfectly isotropic, and the common dipole has a gain of approximately 2.15 dBi (dB over isotropic) broadside to the antenna. Directional antennas generally have their gain specified as either dBi or dBd (dB over dipole, which is dBi - 2.15 dB, so 3 dBd = 5.15 dBi).</p>

<p>To ease calculations, convert the power output of the transmitter to dBm. Using dB throughout turns many a multiplication and division into addition and subtraction, greatly simplifying calculations. For example, a 100 W transmitter puts out +50 dBm, and a 5 W transmitter puts out +37 dBm.</p>

<p><strong>To make the link budget, at a minimum add the transmitter output power, transmitter antenna gain in the desired direction, propagation loss and receiver antenna gain in the desired direction.</strong> By making the calculations in dB relative to some known reference (generally dBm or dBW) this comes down to addition and subtraction.</p>

<p><strong>As a very simple example,</strong> for a 100 W transmitter with dipoles at both ends broadside to each other (+2.15 dBi × 2), over an unobstructed 20 km path using a frequency of 150 MHz (2.00 meters wavelength), we get:</p>

<pre><code>  +50    dBm   power output
 +  2.15 dBi   transmitter antenna gain
 -102    dB    propagation loss, 20 km at 150 MHz
 +  2.15 dBi   receiver antenna gain
 ===========
  -47.7  dBm   signal strength at receiver
</code></pre>

<p>If the minimum usable signal at the receiver for the modulation and bandwidth in use, taking into account natural and receiver noise, is -90 dBm, this gives us a margin of about 42 dB, which is huge. This of course means that in theory, we can reduce our output power by a corresponding amount, maintaining communications with only +8 dBm output, as seen below:</p>

<pre><code>   +8    dBm   power output
 +  2.15 dBi   transmitter antenna gain
 -102    dB    propagation loss, 20 km at 150 MHz
 +  2.15 dBi   receiver antenna gain
 ===========
  -89.7  dBm   signal strength at receiver
</code></pre>

<p>Admittedly, the above link budget gives us for all intents and purposes no margin: to maintain communications over this path using this equipment and mode of transmission, everything must work out absolutely perfectly. To have a 10 dB margin for issues such as fading, we'd need to use +18 dBm (slightly less than 100 mW = +20 dBm) power output, which is trivially achievable with practically <em>any</em> handheld radio.</p>

<p>A link budget for a HF link, or an obstructed VHF link, is much more complex because the propagation losses are harder to calculate than for a pure line-of-sight link, but the general principle remains exactly the same. A complete link budget for a line-of-sight link will at least include the following factors:</p>

<ul>
<li>＋ Transmitter output power</li>
<li>－ Attenuation in the transmitter's antenna cabling, including any impedance matching network</li>
<li>＋ Transmitter antenna gain in the direction of the receiver</li>
<li>－ Propagation loss in free space</li>
<li>－ Attenuation due to absorption in atmospheric gases</li>
<li>－ Margin for attenuation due to rain</li>
<li>－ Margin for attenuation in tree foilage</li>
<li>－ Margin for attenuation due to reflection against walls etc.</li>
<li>－ Margin for signal fading</li>
<li>＋ Receiver antenna gain in the direction of the transmitter</li>
<li>－ Attenuation in the receiver's antenna cabling, including any impedance matching network</li>
<li>＝ Signal strength at the receiver input terminals, to be compared with the minimum necessary signal strength</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to note that several of these factors (propagation loss, atmospheric absorption, foilage losses, and so on) are heavily dependent on the operating frequency. This means that a link budget for one frequency is unlikely to be applicable at another frequency, even if nothing else changes.</p>

  <p>The changing of ISB sideband positions at 10 MHz actually has an engineering background.</p>
  
  <p>In the earliest ISB exciters, it was found appropriate to change the final mixer scheme from subtraction to
  addition mixing at around 10 MHz due to spurious suppression concerns.
  This sometimes caused interoperability problems in international point-to-point ISB circuits.</p>
  
  <p>To overcome this, a practice was formalized in 1959 by the ITU/CCIR as the Recommendation 249, which prescribed
  that the ISB sideband positions could either automatically or manually be interchanged when the output frequency went through
  10 MHz. An often quoted reference where ISB exciter design considerations are handled with German thoroughness is
  W Kleische: ""Fernbedienbarer Steuervorsatz für Kurzwellen-Nachrichtensender"" in ""Telefunken-Zeitung"" December 1962.</p>

<p>$$ \left( 4 \pi df \over c \right)^2 $$</p>

<p>The presence of $f$ in this equation means that losses increase with increasing frequency, so there's an inherent advantage in lower frequencies, right?</p>
","<p>Mathematically yes, the value of that equation increases with frequency. However, the free space path loss equation assumes unity gain antennas at each end.

Thus, the frequency dependence of the free space path loss equation is due to our definition of gain, not space somehow attenuating higher frequencies more.</p>

<p>To do a fair comparison, let's compare two similarly sized antennas. Let's compare a 2.4 GHz antenna with a 5 GHz antenna, each a parabolic dish antenna with a 5 meter reflector diameter.</p>

<p>We can predict <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabolic_antenna#Gain"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the gain of these antennas</a> with the the equation:</p>

"How to access a P25 repeater?","1801","","<p>Are there any special instructions for accessing a P25 repeater? What makes it different from a CTCSS/PL-tone-encoded repeater? What special features does a radio need to access it?</p>
","<p>P25 is a suite of standards for digital radio communications.  P25 is intended to facilitate interoperability between different public safety agencies during emergencies and/or joint operations.  Note that this is a North American standard (and a few other places), Europe has a similar but imcompatible standard called TETRA.</p>

<p>A radio needs to be specially designed for P25 use.  The public safety agencies use reallocated TV frequencies in the 700MHz range. Most of the usual suspects make HTs for P25 and a couple make dual band radios for amateur use. Due to the audio quality and extra features, some amateur clubs are setting up P25 repeaters usually on the 70cm band, but some on the 2m band.</p>

<p>P25 repeaters use whats called a NAC (Network Access Code) in place of the PL tone/CTCSS access common to amateur repeaters.  This a 12-bit prefix that is attached to every packet (including the digitized voice packets).  12 bits means 4096 possible access codes, quite a lot more room than the previous analog methods.  There are a few special codes, a default and an ""open"" code that will pass all traffic.</p>

<p>To program a radio, you need to use a computer, it's too complex to allow keypad programming.</p>

<p>The commerical / public safety versions also support encryption using DES, triple-DES, and AES though it's not consider all that secure do to implementation flaws.  However, it's good enough to meet privacy concerns for first responders.</p>

"How does a switching mixer multiply the two signals?","1798","","<p>I understand what a mixer does, and when I see it in a block diagram it's obvious what purpose it serves and how it fits in the overall design of the radio.</p>

<p>However, when I look at the schematics and see how it's created, I don't understand how it works.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this question, I'm referring to only a switching mixer:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YfBrV.gif"" alt=""Schematic representation of a switching mixer.  RF is brought to a switch which can choose the RF directly, or the RF inverted (180 degrees out of phase), where the LO controls the switch.""></p>

<p>How does switching between the RF and the inverted RF at the LO frequency accomplish $RF \cdot LO$?</p>
","<p>Switching to the inverted signal is equivalent to multiplying by -1. While in an ideal mixer, the RF input can be multiplied by a sinusoidal LO, the switching mixer multiplies by a square LO.</p>

<p>It still works as any mixer would. That is, for each frequency component in the first input $f_1$, and each frequency component in the second input $f_2$, it produces at the output frequency components $f_1 + f_2$ and $f_1 - f_2$.</p>

<p>However, because the LO input must be a square wave (if it's not, the gain of the switching mixer's LO input will make it so), the frequency components of that input are the LO frequency, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_wave#Examining_the_square_wave"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">plus all its odd harmonics</a>. These must be removed with filtering somewhere up or down the line to avoid undesired mixing products.

<p>To calculate the bandwidth we must define what we mean by bandwidth. Let's define it as the range through which SWR is 2:1 or less. In that case, this antenna works from about 14.125 to 14.920 MHz, for a bandwidth of 795 kHz.</p>

<p>We can express that as a fractional bandwidth:</p>

<p>$$
{14.125 - 14.920 \over (14.125 + 14.920) / 2} = 5.5\%
$$</p>

<p>You'll find that similar dipoles will have a similar fractional bandwidth. For example if I run the numbers for the same wire diameter but now 20 meters long, I find a fractional bandwidth of 5.0%.</p>

<p>This decrease in bandwidth is due to the wire diameter being thinner relative to wavelength. A thicker dipole relative to wavelength will have more bandwidth than a thinner one. The bandwidth is actually quite sensitive to the conductor radius.<sup>*</sup> </p>

<p>For example, if I make a dipole for the 2 meter band from 3/4 copper pipe, the fractional bandwidth goes up to 15% on account of the much smaller wavelength and the much thicker wire.</p>

<p>If you need just a rough calculation, then an estimate of fractional bandwidth is sufficient. Just multiply the center frequency by the fractional bandwidth.</p>

The first 3 digits consist of the reflector number, while the fourth digit represents the channel number. As of April 2007, there are 20 operational reflectors (including Echo Reflector 9990, which digitally records and plays back transmissions for testing purposes). Since most reflectors have 10 channels, there are approximately 200 unique reflector channels available for use.</p>

","<p>We went through quite an extended sunspot minimum before the current sunspot cycle started, and I well remember what it was like.  10m was open only when there was e-skip, which wasn't very often.  15m had openings from time to time, but when it was open typically you'd only hear stations in one direction, like from South America for instance, and they'd be weak, like S2 on the meter.  It often seemed like 15m was only open during contests, probably because people would be discouraged from even trying the band at other times.</p>

<p>On the other hand, 20m was open during the daytime, and 40m, 80m, and 160m were open at night.  When I started in 2006 I only had a base-model Elecraft K2 with no options, meaning I had just 11 W output to a vertical and Morse code was my only mode.  I had plenty of fun and worked some good DX from my West Coast QTH, including Europe and Africa, but I had to work harder to get the DX than I would now for sure.  A lot of the DX I worked was contest megastations, but I had several memorable contacts with ordinary hams running ordinary stations in faraway places.</p>

<p>If we get another sunspot minimum like we had before, then I'd say that there will still be plenty of activity on HF.  If you want to work DX, you'll have to listen harder for grayline propagation (magic!) and unusually good conditions, which actually happen fairly often; pay no attention to the computer program that says Europe is currently impossible, turn on the radio instead and find out for yourself.  Consider using Morse code or a computer mode like PSK31; those modes work much better than SSB when conditions are only so-so.</p>

<p>My advice would be to ignore the grumblers, there will still be plenty to do on HF even if the sunspots vanish for a while.</p>

<p>What does this mean? Is it really good for 70cm but no so much for 2m, or am I misunderstanding the principals/construction of this antenna. (Also, it's just a handheld antenna, so it's not a ""dipole"" nor does it have an evident ""ground"" - so I might not just understand what it ""is""). </p>
","<p>A half-wave dipole, or a quarter-wave monopole, are resonant on their fundamental frequencies and all odd harmonics thereof. 2m and 70cm have that harmonic relationship, 70cm being approximately the first odd harmonic of 2m:</p>

<p>So, an antenna that looks like a half wavelength on 2m will look like 1.5 wavelengths on 70cm. Although the radiation pattern is different, the antenna impedance is the same, and so will provide a good match to the radio in either case.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that handheld antennas are usually monopole antennas, like a vertical. They are approximately equivalent to a dipole of twice the length.

"When and why does the size of a ground plane or radials matter?","1719","","<p>Consider these three cases:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>My understanding is that when building or installing an antenna designed to operate over a ground plane (e.g. a quarter-wave vertical), the size of the ground plane does not matter (e.g. the earth, possibly coupled using additional radial wires, or a car roof of unspecified size), provided that it is sufficiently large compared to the wavelength. This is commonly described as the ground plane acting as a reflector, so that there is effectively a second quarter-wave element “below the ground plane”. If this analogy is accurate, then obviously the larger the better.</p></li>
<li><p>Designs involving self-supporting radials, flat or downward-sloping, may use a specific length of radials.</p></li>
<li><p>A vertical resonant center-fed dipole must have a quarter-wave lower element — having the same symmetry as case 1 but physically instantiated.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>On the continuum of antenna designs between a ground plane antenna and a coaxial vertical dipole, why is it that sometimes there is a well-defined optimum size of the ground plane, or rather the antenna element which is not pointing upward, whereas sometimes it doesn't seem to matter at all?</p>
","<p>Perhaps consider that the objective of the ground plane is to present a low impedance. At the feedpoint, the hope is to have all the current go into the antenna, and none of it on the coax common-mode. The lower the impedance of the ground plane, the less current will be on the coax common-mode due to its relatively high impedance.</p>

<p>If the ground plane impedance is not very much lower than the coax common-mode, then there will be significant common-mode current, and what you have built is not the dipole or the vertical or whatever you were trying to build, but something else.</p>

<p>An infinite ground plane would be nice, but ""as big as possible"" will do. Current decreases with distance from the feedpoint, so at far distances the current is negligible, so it doesn't matter much what the situation with the ground plane (or lack thereof) is.</p>

<p>A car roof and a UHF antenna fit this model well. A roof 1.6 meters square is sufficient for a 440 MHz antenna to have about 1.14 wavelengths in any direction. At this size, the impact of the car geometry on the antenna may be detectable if carefully measured, but unlikely to be of any practical significance.</p>

<p>If the idea is to make the ground plane as small as possible, an electrical quarter wavelength radius is a good length. Consider a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarter-wave_impedance_transformer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">quarter-wave transformer</a>: looking at an open through a 1/4 wave transmission line, the open is transformed into a short. The same concept applies to radials: imagine a radial and the monopole as a piece of twin-lead that have been pulled apart at one end to make an L.</p>

<p>This quarter-wavelength size is especially critical in elevated monopoles, that is those without radials buried in soil. Consider, soil can be used as an OK ground plane, although resistive losses make it inefficient. If the radials have minor deficiencies the soil can make up for them without much negative impact. However, air doesn't work as a ground plane at all. If the radials are deficient, then where will that current go? The feedline common-mode? The tower? Either may end up radiating fine, but such an arrangement strictly speaking isn't a monopole.</p>

<p>(Very long elevated radials would work as well, though would not be very practical.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A vertical resonant center-fed dipole must have a quarter-wave lower element — having the same symmetry as case 1 but physically instantiated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the lower element isn't symmetrical, then it isn't a center-fed dipole anymore, by definition. But <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/questions/95/how-does-moving-a-feedpoint-off-center-in-a-dipole-affect-the-resonant-frequency"">off-center fed dipoles</a> can work just fine. A center-fed dipole is balanced, and can be ideally fed with a balanced feedline with no need for a choke or balun. Feeding the dipole off center unbalances it, which would require a feedline unbalanced by the same ratio, or a choke.</p>

<p>However, in many vertical dipole designs, the feedline is concentric with the antenna, and half of the dipole is a radiating sleeve balun. The sleeve balun works by presenting a low impedance from the perspective of the feedpoint, and a high impedance from the perspective to the feedline. It must be an electrical quarter-wave to work, so again the length is critical. At a different length it may still make a fine radiating structure, but it would no longer intrinsically be a balun so the issue of isolating the feedline would need to be solved some other way.</p>

<p>I've purchased a couple of BaoFeng BF-888S's for personal use with friends. I've been told these radios can't be used legally without a licence and given the usage, I doubt I could faithfully even attempt to sort out amateur licences (My friends and I aren't exactly radio enthusiasts).</p>

<p>My Question being is it legal for me to use these radios without a suitable licence? and if not, would it be possible for me to obtain a Simple Business licence within the UK without being a registered company? </p>
","<p>I agree with @Muller that getting a ham license isn't that hard.  But you will need to comply with proper station identification (every 10 minutes).</p>

<p>Those radios can operate on the FRS (Family Radio Service) frequencies, which do not require a license.</p>

<p>HOWEVER, they put out too much power to be legal on that band.  </p>

<p>If you have a company with a license for particular channels that is all well and good, but these radios are field-programmable, so you can't ensure they are always going to be used in compliance with the license.  These radios probably aren't even eligible for use in commercial settings due to spurious outputs or some such technical details.</p>

<p>Putting those kinds of radios in the hands of people with questionable intent is dangerous.  For instance, if they jammed aircraft frequencies (intentionally or otherwise) the investigation would come back to you having provided them.  </p>

<p>The answer to your question:  Ask a lawyer.  Legal questions are not typically answered directly on this stackexchange, nor would any lawyer want to be on the hook for giving out free advice that leads to you or your friends doing something illegal.    </p>

"80/160m Shortened Dipole Trap Questions","1674","","<p>I seem to have forgotten some things I learned years ago for my amateur radio exams.  If I am building a 2 band shortened dipole and want a trap between 80 and 160 do I make the trap resonant on 80 or 160 or elsewhere?  I guess I may be mistakenly viewing the trap as a gate that allows certain frequencies and not others.  Is this correct thinking (albeit simplified)?  Can anyone tell me what I should be shooting for here or help me understand the function of traps in a shortened dipole and how I would go about making a trap for a 80/160 dipole?  Full length 80 is fine, with a short 160, would be best.</p>
","<p>Traps are L-C cicuits that become high impedance at their resonant frequency.  It's common to make traps by winding lengths of coax around circular forms like PVC pipe of various diameters.  The center conductor of one end is soldered to the shield of the other end, and the remaining center conductor and shield connections are connected to the antenna elements. </p>

<p>The series-connected inner conductor and shield of the coiled coaxial-cable act like a bifilar or parallel-turns winding, forming the trap inductor, while the same inner conductor and shield, separated by the coaxial-cable dielectric, serve as the trap capacitor. </p>

<p>The resultant parallel-resonant LC circuit exhibits a high impedance at the resonant frequency of the trap and effectively disconnects everything after the trap from the antenna. Any inner traps (which are operating below their resonant frequency) function as loading coils and shorten the overall physical length of the antenna. </p>

<p>In your case you'll want at least 3 traps.  One will be resonant at the lower end of the 80m band.  This will disconnect the 160m portion of the antenna when you are transmitting on 80m.  You'll want one between there and the feedpoint with a resonant frequency <em>above</em> the highest frequency you'll use on this antenna.  This one is really a loading coil to make up for the physcilally short antenna length.  The other will be between the 80m trap and the end of the entenna.  This one should be resonant <em>below</em> the 160m band and will serve as a loading coil on 160m.</p>

<p>A couple of notes are in order:</p>

<ul>
<li>Coaxial-cable traps have a relatively high Q, which results in a relatively sharp frequency resonance.</li>
<li>Which means traps need to be <em>tuned</em> for their resonant frequency, you can't use a cookbook approach here, if they are not right on, you've just made a dummy load.  To tune the traps, you'll need a dip meter or a sufficiently featured antenna analyzer</li>
<li>Top band (160m) is a harsh mistress.  It rewards the dilligent worshiper who builds full size antennas and punishes all others.  You might consider a folded dipole if you have room for a full sized 80m dipole.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A Further Edit:</strong>
A folded dipole is a dipole antenna with the ends folded back around and connected to each other, forming a loop as shown below:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qNMNb.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""> </p>

<p>The folded dipole antenna is resonant and radiates well at odd integer multiples of a half-wavelength (0.5λ, 1.5λ, etc.), when the antenna is fed in the center like a regular dipole. It can be made resonant at even multiples of a half-wavelength ( 1.0λ, 2.0λ, etc.) by offsetting the feed of the folded dipole (closer to the top or bottom edge of the folded dipole in the picture).</p>

<p>So you could make an off-center fed folding 80m dipole that will also be resonant on 160m.  The feed point impedance will be higher than for a typical dipole, but that's usually not a problem.</p>

"If I hear a distress call, what is the correct procedure for helping the person?","1673","","<p>If during normal operation, I receive a mayday or pan-pan call, how should I handle this?</p>

<p>Am I required to provide help in this situation, and what can I do to make sure I give all the assistance needed, what information should I try and get?</p>

<p>If someone else is working with the station on the distress call, should I join in and help?</p>
","<p>First, if you hear a distress call: <strong>STOP!</strong> <em>Immediately</em> end any transmission in progress. Do not touch any antenna or radio controls except as needed to turn off split operation etc. Lock the VFO to avoid inadvertantly bumping the frequency setting. Particularly, <em>do not reorient the antenna</em> in an attempt to get a better signal. Focus on copying what you can and avoiding any activities that may cause interference. This is something you can actually practice: how long does it take you to reset RIT, turn off split, lock the VFO and getting ready to actually <em>write things down</em>?</p>

<p>Then, I view it as a multiple steps process.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Copy</strong> the message. <em>You will not remember the details.</em> Write down everything, <em>clearly marking anything you are not absolutely certain about.</em> This is a major reason why I feel one should <em>always</em> have writing utensils within easy reach from one's operating location; the odds that you'd receive a distress call are small, but if you do, any old pencil and back of a log book page will help tremendously.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wait</strong> to see if a station better equipped to handle the distress call responds. Maybe there's someone closer, or with necessary knowledge (for example, there's the possibility that a doctor hears a distress call that is about a medical emergency).</p></li>
<li><p>If nobody answers within a few seconds (and you are sure that nobody does and you aren't simply out of range of the other station), <strong>briefly identify yourself</strong> and then stop transmitting again. This might be something as simple as ""amateur radio station VK2VXK received distress call - distressed station please confirm, over over"". Your transmission lets anyone within range of you but out of range of the distressed station know that the frequency is in use for emergency traffic (a definite signal to cease transmissions), and if you get a confirmation from the remote station you have established two-way communications. I'd use the remote station's call sign if they gave one, but don't worry if they didn't. In many jurisdictions, emergency communications is allowed on any frequency unlicensed if needed to solicit help. <em>In many jurisdictions this also means that you can respond to a distress call even if you are normally not authorized to transmit on the frequency in question, if doing so is necessary to provide emergency assistance.</em></p></li>
<li><p>As soon as you have ""claimed"" the distress signal by receiving confirmation from the remote station, tell the remote station to stand by and <strong>pick up the phone and call emergency services.</strong> Immediately inform them that you have received a distress call over radio (so that they do not rely on locating your phone line to determine the location of the emergency), and <em>accurately</em> relay <em>all</em> information in the distress call. Particularly important are <em>the type of emergency, how many people are involved, and the distressed party's location.</em> Be prepared to relay questions and answers between the emergency operator and the distressed station. <em>Stay calm</em> (easier said than done, but very important). <strong>Maintain communications with both parties</strong> until you receive confirmation that emergency services have arrived. If you hear anyone transmitting on the frequency, immediately calmly inform them that the frequency is in use for emergency distress traffic.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If someone else has already established communications with the distressed station, then <em>do not interfere.</em> Also, <em>do not play radio cop.</em> If some other station starts transmitting on the frequency, let either of those already communicating deal with it. Instead, simply copy all details you can, stay on the frequency and do your best to <em>be prepared to jump in if either of the stations ask for assistance which you are able to provide or the station that is in communication with the distressed station clearly goes off the air, but not under any other circumstances.</em></p>

<p>I doubt you would be legally required to provide assistance to a distressed station, but if it was me, I would sleep considerably better at night knowing I did whatever I could to help, even if it was something as simple as ceding a frequency to a station in distress. <strong>Actual emergency or distress communications always has precedence over all other communications.</strong></p>

"Is a multiple-wavelengths antenna possible in UHF and up?","1668","","<p>I know that in the High Frequency regions of the ham bands, the antennas have to be sub-wavelength because most people just can't put up a 160 meter full-size antenna.</p>

<p>Let's say we're in the 23 centimeter or an even higher band. Can the antenna lengths there be, let's say, twice, four times, etc., as large?</p>
","<p>People can, and do, put up full size 160m antennas. Usually ""full size"" means a 1/2 wavelength dipole, or a 1/4 wave vertical. The vertical works because the 1/4 element is ""mirrored"" by the ground plane, creating an image antenna, which makes it very much like a 1/2 wave dipole.</p>

<p>1/2 wavelength seems like a magic number because it is the minimum length required to attain resonance. Antennas can be made smaller and resonated by introducing additional, non-radiating reactive components like inductors or capacitors. However, shortening the antenna in this way makes the antenna less efficient.</p>

<p>Making the antenna <em>longer</em> than 1/2 wavelength isn't frequently done because in most cases there isn't much point to it. As the antenna first becomes longer than 1/2 wavelength, it stops being resonant. If made longer to 1.5 wavelengths, it becomes resonant again. However, it isn't any more efficient than a 1/2 wavelength antenna. In fact, it's likely <em>less</em> efficient, because the current must now travel over more antenna, which has more resistance.</p>

<p>What making the antenna longer does do is alter the radiation pattern. For example, compare a 1/2 wave dipole (in free space):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rN8Y0.jpg"" alt=""1/2 wave dipole radiation pattern""></p>

<p>to a 1.5 wave dipole:</p>

<p>These are from <a href=""http://www.antenna-theory.com/antennas/dipole.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">antenna-theory.com</a>.</p>

<p>Is this really useful? Usually no. One possible exception might be for verticals, where making the antenna longer (to a point, usually 5/8 wavelength) lowers the takeoff angle a bit.</p>

<p>Is the latter more likely to yield better reception? Does it really matter for receive-only?</p>
","<p>If the antenna is sloped upwards towards the end of wire, chances are it works as an effective backbeam. Ie. It receives signals better from opposite direction. This can be enhanced by dropping wire vertically over the branch to the ground . That flat height is ideal for antenna that is purposed to receive as well from front and back. </p>

<p>Naturally the actual pattern will change a lot according to the length of wire and received frequency. At some point antenna will behave omnidirectional, at some point it receives better from the sides of wire. </p>

<p>For all practical purposes a slight angle doesn't matter anything. </p>

"2 Meter horizontal or vertical dipole polarization?","1643","","<p>When should I use one polarization over the other on 2 meters?</p>

<p>I've looked at the radiation patterns for horizontal dipole and seen how it changes based on mounting height. I haven't been able to find any information on how the vertical dipole radiation pattern changes with mounting height.</p>
","<p>For VHF, choice of polarization is not up to your desired radiation pattern, but who you want to be able to communicate with. In HF, the ionosphere causes random rotation of your signal's polarization, but in all line-of-sight communication, VHF or higher, there is no such rotation and a polarization mismatch can result in no signal at all.</p>

<p>You should use vertical polarization if you wish to communicate with existing FM mobile and repeater stations, because they also use vertically polarized antennas (by convention, and because quarter-wave verticals are much more convenient than other types of antennas on vehicles and handhelds).</p>

<p>On the other hand, you should use horizontal polarization if you are attempting 2 meter SSB or other types of DX/weak-signal work. Again by convention, but the convention arises because (if I understand correctly) horizontal dipoles typically have more gain, and because a horizontal dipole is a simple, efficient freestanding antenna.</p>

<p>If you wish to be able to communicate with both types of stations using a single antenna, you <em>can</em> use a diagonally or circularly polarized antenna, as a compromise which has a reliable small amount of loss in either case. However, such antennas are more directional than a vertical (at least as much as a horizontal dipole) and thus require pointing.</p>

","<p>Trees do absorb some RF energy. So do buildings, hills, and other structures. There are very few cases where higher isn't better for antennas.</p>

<p>However, I'd guess that most amateur radio dipoles are below the treetops. Will some energy be lost? Yes. Will the antenna still work? Absolutely. Without the specifics of yours trees, and your antenna, we can't say exactly what effect trees will have, but it's a fair guess that the absorption by trees will be somewhere between negligible to significant but probably not drastic.</p>

<p>Part of the reason trees aren't a huge problem is that at HF, they are electrically small. That is, their size is smaller, relative to the wavelength of interest. Longer wavelengths pass through things more easily, such as the thumping bass through those annoying cars.</p>

","<p>My trick is instead of cutting, rather <em>extend</em> the whip first, and see if the SWR gets better or worse. Extend it 1/2"" with a bit of wire wrapped around it and sticking out. If the SWR gets better, then you made it too short in the first place. If it gets worse, you can start trimming.</p>

<p>Remember you should only measure SWR when you are away from the antenna - anyone within 1 or 2 m of the antenna will change the SWR and confuse you as you tune.</p>

<p>I expect the mix of them would be 1 KHz.</p>
","<p>If you simply add two sine waves together, it's a linear operation and you do not get mixing.  So you would see only the 27.000 and 27.001 MHz components.</p>

<p>If you want to get the sum or difference frequencies, you have to ""mix"" them in a non-linear device, like a diode or a switching transistor.  Then you will get components at .001 MHz (the difference), 54.001 (the sum), as well as some left over power at the original 27.000 and 27.001 frequencies.  </p>

<p>Actually, you will get even more frequencies than these as ""higher order"" mixing products, like 2x27.000 - 27.001 = 26.999 MHz and many other combinations, as well as the harmonics (double, triple, etc.) of 27.000 and 27.010.

"Why doesn't adding a resistor inline to a 12 V car charger change output voltage","1499","","<p>I purchased a baofeng car charger for my little UV5Rv2 HT. It was advertised to work with the radio, so I didn't think much of it. It turns out, all it does is pass my car electrical system voltage through to the base charger! Looking at the base charger, I see it accepts 10&nbsp;V input DC and outputs 8.4&nbsp;V DC and 400&nbsp;mA current.</p>

<p>So, I thought I could solder a little resistor inline the charger to add additional resistance to produce a lower voltage. It seems this would work for a fixed load, understanding that my car would produce approximately 14.5&nbsp;V output while running.</p>

<p>So $$ 10 = 0.4 \cdot R $$ produces $$ {10 \over .4} = 25 $$</p>

<p>So the resistance of the charger is approximately 25 $\Omega$, which is maybe where I'm going wrong somewhere, because if I measure resistance across the + and - terminal of the base station while plugged in, I get 10.56 M$\Omega$. Ignoring that and moving on, I need to figure out what the resistance should be for a 400&nbsp;mA load creating a 4.5 voltage drop.</p>

<p>$ 4.5 = 0.4 \cdot R $ gives me ${4.5 \over .4} = 11.25$. So I figured putting a $11.25\ \Omega$ resistor inline the positive terminal of the car charger might give me the voltage drop I wanted. This is not the case however. So knowing I have a constant load of 14.5&nbsp;V and a 400&nbsp;mA load, how do I calculate the size resistor I should be putting inline to drop 4.5&nbsp;V to hopefully get to approximately 10&nbsp;V?</p>
","<p><strong>You can't use a fixed resistor</strong> to control the input the voltage for an arbitrary electronic device, only one which is a <strong>passive</strong> load, such as a resistor, or an LED. (Note that even a simple LED invalidates your Ohm's-law-based reasoning, because it does not have a fixed value of $R$, though it can still be handled with a resistor.)</p>

<p>A battery charger is not passive — it contains a control system providing the appropriate voltage and/or current for each of the stages of charging (which depend on the particular battery chemistry).</p>

<p>Since you say your “base charger” is marked as having an 8.4 V output, this means it is quite possibly not a charger <em>per se</em> at all, but a power supply for a charging circuit built into the radio. And the 400 mA figure is not the expected output but rather the <em>maximum</em> output. (Hint: No device can <strong>ever</strong> have an output which is both a fixed current and a fixed voltage. It's physically impossible.)</p>

<p>Whether the device is a power supply (power adapter) or a battery charger, in either case it is going to be <em>regulated</em> — it contains circuits which produce the target output voltage (or current) regardless of the input voltage (within the designed limits). The input <em>power</em> will be maintained, determined by the demands of the load on the output; if the input voltage is lower, more current will be drawn to compensate; if it is higher, then less current.</p>

<p>The result of inserting a resistor in series with a too-high voltage input is that the device will see a too-high voltage whenever it is drawing little current (you can calculate this; just look at $V_\text{across resistor} = IR$ when $I=0$) — and this will happen initially before things are fully powered on, and finally when the battery charge is complete. If there's a protection circuit, this could trip it; if not, and the voltage exceeds the rated voltage of the components, it could damage the device or cause it to misbehave temporarily.</p>

"Why there is no AFSK in FLDIGI","1495","","<p>I was expecting to see an AFSK option in FLDIGI ""Op Mode"" menu (as there is one option for CW, i.e.), why it isn't there?</p>

","<p>Fldigi is largely intended for HF operation. From <a href=""http://www.w1hkj.com/beginners.html"">the beginner's guide</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fldigi is a computer program intended for Amateur Radio Digital Modes operation using a PC (Personal Computer). Fldigi operates (as does most similar software) in conjunction with a conventional HF SSB radio transceiver, and uses the PC sound card as the main means of input from the radio, and output to the radio.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>AFSK, as used by APRS and packet radio, is not very popular on HF. A few people do it for sure, but having tried it personally I can tell you it's not a very robust mode with all the noise and fading in a typical HF channel. Since the mode is typically deployed with no FEC at all, it's usual for any HF packet frequencies to be clogged with nothing but retransmit attempts.</p>

<p>Fldigi is also focused on ""chat"" modes, like PSK31. Again from the beginner's guide:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this context, we are talking about modes used on the HF (high frequency) bands, specifically chat modes, those used to have a regular conversation in a similar way to voice or Morse, where one operator talks for a minute or two, then another does the same. These chat modes allow multiple operators to take part in a net.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I suspect the reason you do not find AFSK in Fldigi is that it's neither popular (or really effective) on HF, and it's not a chat mode.</p>

Otherwise, if getting a cable is the only option, is this a standard cable that can be bought in computers/electronics shops? Is their software readily available?</p>
","<p>Unfortunately, you fell into one of the traps of the Chinese radios! You can't really assume what frequencies are they programmed with. </p>

<p>Basically, the radios are designed to be programmed with a certain set of frequencies, just like so-called ""professional"" radios of many other manufacturers. The ""channel"" on the radio is just a memory location, into which a frequency is written.

<p>Unfortunately, just like with many other ""professional"" radios, BF-888s aren't programmable without the cable. For ""professional"" radios, this part would normally be done by your dealer, in accordance with your license, but since you're getting the radios yourself, then you also need to do the programming on your own, or find a radio dealer close to you who might do it for you.

"Is the bandwidth of an LCR resonant circuit independent of the capacitance?","1466","","<p>Is the bandwidth of an LCR resonant circuit independent of the capacitance, if the inductance and its series resistance are kept the same, and the Q is high? </p>

<p>This question and the calculation associated with it were originally posted by a radio amateur Anthony G3LAA, who deserves credit for spotting it.</p>

<p>At resonance the reactances of L and C are the same and Q is equal to that reactance divided by the series R of the inductor. If we take Q equal to f0/B where B is the bandwidth, and substitute the usual formulae for Q and the resonant frequency f0 in terms of L, C and R,then C cancels out and we are left with B proportional to 1/L. This is true, for all practical purposes (fapp) at moderate frequencies for both series and parallel circuits, and implies that changing the C in the LCR circuit, although this changes the resonant frequency, the bandwidth remains constant.</p>

<p>I realise that there are a lot of simplifying assumptions in the formulae, both electrical and  mathematical, but, fapp, this looks correct to me. Please, am I right?</p>

<p>It has an obvious practical advantage in, say, a TRF receiver, with fixed inductance and a variable capacitor to do the tuning, keeping the bandwidth constant over the tuning range.</p>

<p>(The following is added in response to @Phil Frost's comment, thanks.)</p>

<p>Here is the maths — I assume that the formulae for $Q$, $\omega_0 = 2\pi f_0$ and bandwidth, are familiar enough not to need explanation, except that I use $B$ for bandwidth and brevity. I also accept that the formulae depend on many simplifying assumptions, but, fapp, they are good enough, for high $Q$, above about 10.</p>

<p>$$Q = \frac{1}{\omega_0RC} = \frac{\omega_0L}{R}$$</p>

<p>Reactances equal at resonance, $Q$ is  reactance over $R$.</p>

<p>$$\omega_0=\frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}} \tag{1}$$</p>

<p>Substituting for $\omega_0$ in each $Q$ formula we get:</p>

<p>$$Q=\frac{\sqrt{LC}}{RC} = \frac{L}{R} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}$$</p>

<p>Both of these simplify to</p>

<p>$$Q=\frac{1}{R}\sqrt{\frac{L}{C}} \tag{2}$$</p>

<p>For bandwidth $B$ (frequency difference at half power level) we have $Q=\omega_0/B$ or </p>

<p>$$B=\frac{\omega_0}{Q} \tag{3}$$</p>

<p>Substituting in (3) for $\omega_0$ from (1) and $Q$ from (2) we finally get </p>

<p>$$B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}\cdot R\cdot\sqrt{\frac{C}{L}}$$</p>

<p>which simplifies to $B=R/L$    i.e. Bandwidth is independent of the capacitor value over the range of resonant frequencies for the inductor.</p>

<p>Is this correct? I now think so and will give that as an answer</p>

","<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I'm afraid you're misinformed. <strong>No single antenna, no matter what the design,</strong> can be better than another at receiving multiple signals at once. A receiving antenna doesn't know anything about ""one signal"" or ""two signals""; it just collects radiation and turns it into current in the feed line.</p>

<p>There are ways in which you might optimize the antenna for your particular purpose, but they will depend on details you haven't given. In particular, are the “multiple sources” you refer to at fixed locations? If so, you can use a directional antenna, designed to have more gain in those particular directions. However, this only improves signal-to-noise ratio; it does not help separate the signals.</p>

<p>If you use <strong>two separate directional antennas</strong> pointed at the two sources, then you can receive them independently by having two separate receivers, of course. (Connecting two directional antennas to one receiver <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/questions/4905/connect-two-receiving-antennas-to-the-same-radio/4907#4907"">is just making one more complex directional antenna</a>.)</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>A high sample rate in a software-defined radio can help with receiving multiple signals, but it's not a matter of “switching”. The sample rate determines the maximum <em>bandwidth</em> — the size of the slice of the RF spectrum that you receive. If you are trying to receive two signals <em>at different frequencies</em>, then you can receive them with a single SDR device, programmed appropriately, if they are close enough together to fall simultaneously within the receive bandwidth, like this:</p>

<p>This is not helpful if the two signals you want to receive are at the <em>same</em> frequency. But if they are, they are probably transmitting in bursts or using some other type of multiplexing to avoid interfering with each other. What you do at the receiver entirely depends on what the transmitters are doing.</p>

<p>You might wish to ask a different question (posted separately, please): tell us <em>about the signals you want to receive</em> (what are they, are you making the transmitters or do they already exist, etc), and ask how to build a receiver for that.</p>

"Configuring an SDR for CW?","1427","","<p>So I'm developing my own SDR software from scratch (I like to ""own"" the code).  The channel between the RF-to-USB hardware and the software is 192kHz sample-rate IQ audio samples.  The degrees of freedom seem to include at least 4 frequencies and a switch.  The 4 frequencies are: RF filter frequency, external tuner reference oscillator frequency, software complex multiplication oscillator frequency, software bandpass filter center-frequency (also filter bandwidth).  Then select from I, Q, I+Q, I-Q, or abs(I,Q) for audio output.  Then resample as necessary to match the audio output API.</p>

<p>So assume I set the 1st frequency (front-end RF filter) to the HF band of interest, the 2nd HF reference oscillator to the middle of some CW HF band.  Now say I find a QSO 12.500 kHz up from the HF reference oscillator, and I'd like the resulting Morse Code audio side tone frequency to be 750 Hz.  </p>

<p>Where do I set my software oscillator frequency for the complex multiplication and what do I want my software bandpass filter center frequency to be to hear Morse Code with the desired side tone?  (Do I have 2 choices?  If so, how to choose?)  Which final IQ mux output do I select to feed the audio speaker?</p>
","<p>Implementing a CW receiver in an SDR is pretty much like implementing a SSB receiver.</p>

<p>You will tune the RF bits to some band of interest.</p>

<p>Next, you will multiply the I/Q signal so that the CW signal you want to receive is at 750 Hz, if that's your desired pitch.</p>

<p>Next, you must filter. There are two reasons. The obvious reason: you don't want to hear everything in the band. But also, the I/Q data contains both positive and negative frequencies. Frequency 0 corresponds to the LO frequency (plus the shift you introduced in the multiplication step above). Negative frequencies are below that, positive frequencies above. We need to, at some point, get rid of these negative frequencies, because they correspond to the LSB sidebands which we don't want or need.</p>

<p>After you've filtered, all the negative frequencies will be attenuated by the filter's stopband. Now we can take I, just Q, or I+Q, or I-Q (the only difference between each is the phase), and what you will hear is all the positive frequencies, plus all the negative frequencies. However, since we filtered the negative frequencies away, we in effect hear just the positive frequencies.</p>

<p>The only difference between this and a USB receiver is the filter width. If you want to make it a LSB receiver, all you need to do is move the filter passband into the negative frequencies.</p>

<p>For an example, see this <a href=""http://www.oz9aec.net/index.php/grc-examples#ssbrx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">example in GNU Radio Companion by OZ9AEC</a>. GNU Radio Companion can be a good source for examples because it's programmed by graphical flowcharts. Here's one from that article:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wbTu6.png"" alt=""SSB receiver in GRC""></p>

<p>There are some <em>FFT Sinks</em> which are graphical UI elements just to visualize the data at that point. <em>USRP Source</em> configures his particular hardware. The <em>Frequency Xlating FIR filter</em> performs the multiplication step, while additionally resampling the data (the USRP has a very high sample rate). Then there's a band pass filter, and he's added some automatic gain. <em>Rational Resampler</em> resamples the data again to get it down to an audio sample rate. <em>Complex to Real</em> discards <em>Q</em> and gives you just <em>I</em>. The multiplier at the end is a volume control, then it goes to the speakers.</p>

<p>Also if you look closely, the cutoff frequencies for the band pass filter are negative. As configured, this is an LSB receiver. Make those positive, and narrow, and you have a CW receiver.</p>

<p>If I use an aluminum boom but I insulate the elements from the boom, can I keep the same design? How does it affect performance, in particular SWR?</p>

<p>It is a 2m (144-148mhz) designed to be a portable VHF / UHF (not mounted on a mast).</p>
","<p>So, by design, the elements of any Yagi have a zero current going through the center point. That's pretty obvious be symmetry: assuming you excite the ""left and right"" halves of the driving dipole with exactly opposing voltages, everything should be symmetrical across the plane through the middle of that dipole.</p>

<p>Hence, if you approach that plane from left and right, you should see the same voltage, at any time. If two points have exactly the same potential, no current will flow. That's why Yagis work even if their elements are non-perfectly isolated from a metal boom.</p>

<p>The boom correction factor is really just the effect of having a metal object of non-zero left/right dimension in the way of your EM field – that will basically ""swallow"" a bit of E-field, but that effect should be relatively small for reasonably sized booms. </p>

<p>SWR will practically not be affected; the couple of millimeters you'd have to add to the driving dipole to compensate for a conductive boom are, from a matching perspective equivalent to using the antenna with a couple 0.001 mismatched cables – you'll be hardly pressed to find a matching circuit that is good enough to make the effect even measurable. Also, remember, you're not going to use that antenna for a CW of <strong>exactly</strong> the maximum efficiency frequency of that Yagi, but a couple of MHz around; now, ""±1.5MHz around the optimal frequency"" means your wavelength-to-antenna element ratio is off by around an easy percent, anyway – it's really no use to over-optimize your antenna here.</p>

The feedline could very well be 600-ohm ladderline (I am not sure; the line is not marked with impedance). </p>

<p><strong>So my question is this:</strong> in particular, why does the W1FB full-wave loop design <em>not</em> require some form of a transformer between the 450-ohm ladderline and the 100-ohm antenna? My research tells me it's obvious that having matched impedance would allow more efficient power transfer from the feedline to the antenna. Is it because ladderline is balanced? Is that kind of impedance mismatch allowable? Is it a rule that you don't need a balun for ladderline? Is it purely a choice by the designer? I'm familiar with the subject of electronics, but I'm certainly no electrical engineer, so the theory behind this just seems to contradict practical examples. </p>

<p>Thanks for any and all help. I've been trying to find a reason for this for days and nothing seems logical to me.</p>
","<p>It doesn't make sense because people on the internet are wrong or misinformed, present conflicting information, or just plain don't know what they are talking about.</p>

<p>Impedance mismatches aren't the end of the world. An impedance mismatch does not, in itself, cause power loss. It causes power to be <em>reflected</em>, at which point it will go in the other direction until it's either absorbed or encounters another impedance mismatch which reflects it back at the antenna. When it gets back to the antenna, some of that power is radiated, and the rest of it reflects back and forth again until its all radiated.</p>

<p>In fact, if you had a lossless transmission line, impedance mismatches wouldn't matter at all. Each parcel of power would just reflect back and forth until it's radiated.</p>

<p>We can't have lossless transmission line, but we can keep losses very low. One way is to buy good coax. Good coax is expensive. Another way is to use ladder line. For the cost, ladder line has lower loss than coax.</p>

<p>Interestingly, a piece of transmission line can be used as a transformer. If that transmission line is 1/4 wave long, it's called a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarter-wave_impedance_transformer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">quarter-wave transformer</a>, and it makes whatever's at the end of it look like the conjugate impedance. That's part of what's going on in some of these antennas, but there's a problem...</p>

<p>Whenever you hear someone say ""don't use a balun"", you should be thinking:</p>

<ol>
<li>they may not have a good understanding of RF engineering, and</li>
<li>the feedline is actually part of the antenna</li>
</ol>

<p>See <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/questions/538/using-a-balun-with-a-resonant-dipole?rq=1"">Using a balun with a resonant dipole</a>. You absolutely can feed a dipole without a balun, but you have to understand that if you do it, the coax is as much of the antenna as the balun. This means anything you read about dipoles (like, their radiation pattern, feedpoint impedance, etc) does not apply. It doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad antenna, it's just some other kind of antenna which might be good or bad. Since the geometry of the feedline is different at each station, it doesn't mean anything. It just means you don't know.</p>

<p>Be especially dubious when you hear ""don't use a balun"" in combination with ""multi-band antenna"". One way to make a multi-band antenna is to design the antenna such that there are a lot of common-mode currents on the feedline, thus making the feedline in effect a <a href=""http://www.w8ji.com/long_wire_antenna.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">long-wire antenna</a>. The ""antenna"" is really just a distraction: the feedline does most of the radiating. There are <a href=""http://www.w8ji.com/e-h_antenna.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">quite a few antennas that dubiously work this way</a>.</p>

<p>I hope that addresses your concerns enough. I can't really explain every question you have (that would be an entire book on antenna design), but regardless there are some good lessons to be learned here:</p>

<ul>
<li>the internet can be wrong,</li>
<li>especially when hams are writing about antennas,</li>
<li>your intuition about things not making sense is well-founded, and</li>
<li>the best way to learn how things really work involves a good deal of skepticism.</li>

"Distance between antenna and radio","1377","","<p>I live in a small cottage with an unlevelled terrain. My house was built in the lower part of it (left-side), and in the other half of it there is a hill. On top of the hill there's a fairly good plateau where I would like to have my antennas installed, since the place my house was built seems to be too low (my place is surrounded by hills). </p>

<p>On the top of this plateau, I can see very from a very big distance, and I'll bet that would be the perfect area for my antennas. </p>

<p>What I can't solve is the fact that my antennas would stay just too far apart from my house, where I plan to have my shack put together. There would be necessary a whole lot of cable to reach the antennas -never counted, but as a wild guess - about 350 feet. </p>

<p>The answer I can't seem to find here - and elsewhere - is how much is too much, when it comes down to setting an antenna apart from one's shack? I understand that in order to properly resonate, my entire system, i.e. radio + cable + antenna need to be in harmony and everything has to be thoroughly calculated. </p>

<p>To me it seems that's it's just too much cable and it will definitely affect my overall <em>transception</em> quality, if not entirely cripple the entire system. </p>

<p>What are your thoughts on the cable distance? Any workaround for that kind of problem if that is not an option? </p>

<p>I'm still to take some small QRP equipment and run some tests on the lower part of my cottage, to see if that's an option, should the whole placing the antenna on the topmost part option become void. </p>
","<p>This isn't nearly as big of an issue as you're thinking.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The effect of a longer <em>feed line</em> between your transceiver and your antenna is increased <em>loss</em> — the signal will be weaker at the destination.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you are transmitting, this means that less of the power from your final amplifier (whether built into your radio or external) reaches the antenna and radiates. Thus, the consequence of the loss is exactly the same as if your radio had less power output — not anything inherently bad.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are receiving, this means that less of the power gathered by your antenna arrives at your receiver. This is problematic if the signal is too weak for the <em>sensitivity</em> of your receiver (but that is unlikely for HF operation) or if you have sources of interference near your receiver that are stronger than the signal (this is something you can avoid).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The way loss in a transmission line works is that, at a given frequency, over a given length of the cable, a certain proportion of the energy will be lost (dissipated in heat or leaked out). Since this is a ratio, it is easily expressed in dB. For example, Times Microwave LMR-400 (a model of coaxial cable popular for high-end amateur use) <a href=""https://www.timesmicrowave.com/documents/resources/LMR-400.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">specifies that</a> at 30 MHz (the high frequency end of HF), there will be 0.7 dB of loss in 100 ft of cable.</p>

<p>In order to calculate loss for a particular length, you just multiply it (given that it's in dB).</p>

<p>$$0.7\,\text{dB} \cdot \frac{350\,\text{ft}}{100\,\text{ft}} = 2.45\,\text{dB}$$</p>

<p>So, with this cable you would have 2.45 dB of loss. <strong>That's not bad at all</strong> — compared to the average ham's setup, you'll be more than making up for it with your advantageous antenna location and height (assuming you put up a modest tower).</p>

<p>(If you were operating at higher frequencies — VHF or UHF range, say — cable loss becomes <em>much</em> more of a problem. But here, having a clear line of sight from your antenna makes even more of an improvement.)</p>

<p>You can also do better than coax, for HF operation. If you use <em>ladder line</em> (two plain wires separated by insulating spacers), you will get less loss at a lower price. The primary disadvantage of ladder line is that it will not work properly if there are nearby conductive objects, but that is not at all a problem for a long outdoor run in open air (not along the ground). It is also not suitable for higher frequencies as the spacing of the wires must be much smaller than the wavelength and consistent.</p>

<p>The above is assuming perfect SWR — that is to say, if you have an antenna that is built for the frequency band you are operating on. If you want to use many different bands with a single antenna, you will need an “antenna tuner”, and depending on the precise relationships there will be more loss in the section of feed line between the antenna and the tuner. You can reduce this problem by installing a remote-controlled/automatic tuner at the antenna end rather than at your transceiver.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I understand that in order to properly resonate, my entire system, i.e. radio + cable + antenna need to be in harmony and everything has to be thoroughly calculated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is false. There are badly-designed systems where every part influences the characteristics, but you should avoid that (and they would be nearly impossible to “thoroughly calculate” because you would need more information than you can practically gather and compute for the model). In a properly built system, the only shape and lengths that matter are those of the antenna itself (and its immediate surroundings — which is why you mount an antenna up high to avoid them).</p>

"What about the digital mode ROS causes some to consider it spread spectrum?","1368","","<p>The FCC disallows amateur spread spectrum communications below 220MHz.  At the moment the relatively new digital mode, ROS, is considered, by some, to be spread spectrum.  So this mode is getting little to no use in the US.</p>

<p>It doesn't seem much different than other tone digital modes though, and never claims a bandwidth larger than phone.</p>

<p>What is the definition of ""spread spectrum"" according to the FCC?</p>

<p>In what ways could ROS be considered spread spectrum?</p>

<p>What about ROS suggests that it's not spread spectrum?</p>

<p>The only page on ROS I've been able to find, <a href=""http://rosmodem.wordpress.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rosmodem.wordpress.com/</a> , doesn't seem to have an in-depth explanation of what the mode is and does.</p>
","<p>Some consider ROS Modem Spread Spectrum because of statements on the author's website call it: Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum. It's worth noting that the author is European and in Europe, spread spectrum is allow on the HF bands. Undoubtedly, part of this is marketing.  Describing a new mode as Spread Spectrum gives it a more techy feel and spread spectrum is something that came out of the military, further increasing the cool factor.</p>

<p>The FCC's definition of Spread Spectrum:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Spread spectrum techniques are emissions that use bandwidth-expansion modulation >techniques to intentionally spread the information transmitted over a wide bandwidth. At any frequency in the frequency segment or bandwidth the SS emission occupies, either the spectral power density of the transmitted signal is reduced to a comparatively low level or the duration of the transmitted signal is very brief.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Source: <em>WT Docket No. 10-62</em> <strong>RM-11325</strong> <em>REPORT AND ORDER</em><br>
Adopted: February 22, 2011 Released: March 4, 2011</p>

<p>The FCC's ruling on the matter simply reaffirms what SS is and where it's allowed.  They didn't rule that ROS <em>is</em> SS or not.  This probably has more to do with conflicting information and lack of clear guidance.  The author calls it SS, but examining the actual protocol reveals that it's not.  It's not very popular in the US (largely due to this conflict) and so the FCC didn't have the number of opinions it usually gets when considering a ruling.</p>

<p>To lump the remaining two questions together:</p>

<p>It's not spread spectrum; it doesn’t hop the VFO frequency. It is simply FSKs according to a programmable algorithm, and it meets the infamous 1kHz shift 300 baud rule (FCC §97.307(f)3):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Only a RTTY or data emission using a specified digital code listed in §97.309(a) of this part may be transmitted. The symbol rate must not exceed 300 bauds, or for frequency-shift keying, the frequency shift between mark and space must not exceed 1 kHz.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Digging into it further, ROS uses multiple tones over either a 2kHz or 500Hz bandwidth, (the frequencies for each mode/bandwidth are hard coded in the software). According to the rather thin documentation, ROS has three main speeds, 16 baud, 8 baud and 4 baud. There are some special modes, such as 7bd/100Hz for 136 and 502kHz (and 80m for some reason), plus an ‘EME’ mode for use on 2m and some other bands, for weak signal work as it has, in theory at least, the capability to decode signals that have a Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) of -35dB, which is even lower than WSPR.</p>

"Should I ground my radio to the chassis or battery for a mobile install?","1354","","<p>From what I've seen, there are generally two ways to power a mobile radio:</p>

<li>Positive lead to battery, negative lead grounded to chassis</li>
<li>Both positive and negative leads to battery</li>
</ul>

<p>I know that antennas should be grounded to the chassis, but what about the radio itself? There must be some electrical difference, but I'm not sure what it is and I've seen a lot of contradictory information.</p>

<p>What is the ""correct"" way to do this? The vehicle is a 2012 Honda Accord.</p>
","<p>There are two reasons for the advice to run direct to the battery:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Minimize the <em>area enclosed by the power connections</em>. This reduces both interference picked up by the wiring, and inductance (which is undesirable in power supply connections).</p></li>
<li><p>Minimize resistance. A radio can be a fairly heavy load as car <em>accessories</em> go, so you want to avoid any voltage drop you can, and the chassis may not give you the best conduction to the battery.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Neither of these is a reason to wire specifically to the battery per se, only to avoid using a completely different conductor (the chassis). According to K0BG.com, a site dedicated to mobile amateur radio, <a href=""http://www.k0bg.com/wiring.html"" rel=""nofollow"">some modern cars have electrical systems in which you shouldn't wire direct to the battery terminals</a>, for example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The use of these sophisticated subsystems have necessitated the
  relocation of the ELD to the negative lead of the SLI battery as shown
  at right (surrounding the battery ground lead), and below right
  (incorporated in the battery negative connector). The photos are of a
  2014 Nissan Titan, and 2013 Honda Accord respectively, but other makes
  are similar such as Ford's F150 shown below at left.</p>
  
  <p>Ford's Battery Monitoring SystemIt should be obvious that transceiver
  ground connections cannot be made directly to the battery as
  recommended in the past, as doing so would bypass the BMS. Thus in the
  examples shown, the negative lead would be attached to the battery's
  chassis connection point (Titan), or on the ground side of the ELD
  (Honda).</p>

","<p>Lemma: this antenna is a dipole with one leg of it acting as a balun. Specifically, a <a href=""http://www.antenna-theory.com/definitions/bazooka.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bazooka balun</a> (AKA sleeve balun).</p>

<p>Whenever you want to feed a dipole with coax, you have to <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/q/538/218"">do something about common-mode currents</a>. The trick is, one way or another, to make the common-mode currents on the coax a high impedance. Hopefully there's a much lower impedance path somewhere (like, the dipole you're trying to feed) and so there won't be much common-mode current.</p>

<p>How does it work?</p>

<p>First, consider that differential-mode currents on the feedline are irrelevant to anything outside the feedline's shield since their associated fields cancel. For now, let's simplify the situation by ignoring the antenna and assuming an infinitely long feedline. And let's also ignore the inside of the feedline and consider it just a fat wire. Here's a simplified view, in cross-section:</p>

<p>Further, the feedline shield and the can together form another coaxial transmission line, with the feedline shield as the center, and the can as the shield. We will call this the can-coax. This transmission line is shorted at one end, and open at the other. It's a quarter wavelength long, which hints this may be a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarter-wave_impedance_transformer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">quarter-wave transformer</a>.</p>

<p>Next, consider that at the open end of the can, any common-mode current on the feedline must become a differential-mode current on the can-coax. Because, only a differential-mode current can possibly flow on the center of a coaxial transmission line.</p>

<p>So effectively, the common mode is in series with a shorted, quarter-wave stub:</p>

"What determines power handling capacity of an antenna?","1346","","<p>I just bought a cheap 1/4-wavelength, 2m. mag-mount antenna. The package says it can handle 50 watts. I can think of three things that could limit the capacity:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>$I^2R$ losses in the connection to the feedpoint and in the antenna wire itself: increases with increasing current, produces gradual breakdown of materials;</p></li>
<li><p>dielectric heating at the feedpoint: increases with increasing voltage and frequency, produces gradual breakdown of materials;</p></li>
<li><p>dielectric breakdown at the feedpoint, happens suddenly when voltage is too large, produces immediate failure.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Are these right? Are there others?</p>
","<p>I think you pretty much summarized limiting factors in the general case. I'd add that there can be dielectric losses or breakdown at the ends, as well as the feedpoint. Common antenna designs (quarter-wave verticals, center-fed half-wave dipoles) are fed at a low-impedance node, and the ends are high-impedance nodes, so I'd expect dielectric breakdown (arcing) to be more likely at the ends than the feedpoint. At high power levels, the antenna ends can reach voltages high enough to cause arcing to nearby conductors (towers, trees, gutters) or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corona_discharge"" rel=""nofollow"">corona discharge</a>. Unlikely at your 50W example, however.</p>

<p>I'd also consider RF exposure. Consider that this is is a VHF antenna, and that exposure limits are lower with increasing frequency. Also consider that this antenna isn't installed in a fixed location, no one is going to test the RF exposure levels, and there's nothing preventing anyone from getting close to the antenna. In fact, given that most people will stick them to cars, it's not only possible, but <em>likely</em> that someone will be close. So, the manufacturer may specify a power limit due to regulatory or liability concerns.</p>

"What is the impedance of an end-fed half-wave antenna?","1337","","<p>It is my understanding that the feed-point impedance ($Z_a$) of an end-fed half-wave antenna is dependent on at least the following factors:</p>

<li>$D_a$: The diameter of the radiating element of the antenna.</li>
<li>Environment surrounding the antenna.</li>

This is of course an approximation assuming the dipole is relatively thin, and that the capacitance to the other half of the dipole is the most relevant factor.</p>

<p>So if there isn't another half of the dipole, what is the relevant factor? In practice it's going to be the ground, and the feedline. Neither is amenable to a simple expression. Simulation of your particular installation is your best bet.</p>

<p>We can make some generalizations though:</p>

<p>An end-fed dipole is resonant (or not) just like a more ordinary center-fed dipole. The feedpoint (in the middle, near the end, or somewhere between) is transparent to the resonance of the wire.</p>

<p>An exactly half-wave dipole isn't resonant in the sense that its feedpoint impedance has a reactive component. <a href=""http://www.antenna-theory.com/antennas/halfwave.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Theoretically, (73 + j42.5)Ω</a>.</p>

<p>When the dipole is too short, its reactance will be capacitive. When it's too long, inductive. Since the exactly half-wave dipole has a slightly inductive reactance, shortening it can eliminate the reactance. The exact amount of shortening depends on the thickness of the wire. 0.41λ sounds like a reasonable estimate.</p>

<p>The feedpoint impedances repeat with every wavelength of length. That is, in terms of feedpoint impedance, 0.5λ, 1.5λ, 2.5λ, ... dipoles all look the same.</p>

<p>As the dipole becomes thicker, its bandwidth increases. That means for an equal change in length, the impedance of a thicker dipole will change less than a thinner dipole.</p>

<p>Since the impedance must repeat with every wavelength, this also means that the highest impedance (for example, at the ends of a half-wave dipole) is lower with a thicker wire.</p>

<p>Finally, a practical point: since the impedance at the end of a dipole is very high, the common-mode impedance looks relatively low. Successfully making an end-fed dipole then depends on very effective choking (a very high common-mode impedance), which is difficult to realize in practice. If the choking isn't very effective (meaning, the common mode impedance isn't much higher than the differential mode), then making the choking more effective will increase the impedance seen by the transmitter.</p>

"What is a ""random wire antenna""?","1323","","<p>Some antenna tuners claim to match any “random wire” to any HF frequency. Can one really use a random wire as a practical antenna system?</p>

<p>From everything I have heard, the resonance of the antenna (length, material) is what defines its performance on a given frequency. Is this only a minimalist emergency use concept, a fraction of a watt being better than no antenna at all?</p>
","<p>Yes, a random wire can be a practical antenna. Anything conductive can be loaded up.  Somethings work better than others.  But if you want to play around, there's no reason the antenna has to be an ""antenna"".</p>

<p>There are, of course, some drawbacks:</p>

<ul>
<li>You must have a tuner. </li>
<li>You might not get a match on every band you'd like to work.</li>
<li>For efficiency, you need a counterpoise, an insulated wire that attaches to the ground of your tuner. Ideally, this is 1/4 wave long at the lowest band you'll operate on.  Note that this is not a radial, so it doesn't have to be straight.</li>
<li>The ""antenna"" starts at the back of your tuner (i.e., in the shack), so power levels must be low unless you like living in an RF fields and collecting RF burns.</li>

"Decimation to listen to FM radio with gnu radio","1320","","<p>I am trying to listen to FM station using an SDR and GNU radio. I have followed this procedure <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yTKYW.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yTKYW.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Is there a reason that the decimation is done gradually? For example would it make a difference if I change audio decimation to 1 in WBFM Receive and change the decimation to 50 in rational resampler block?</p>
","<p>One reason in general to perform decimation in multiple steps is it reduces the computational requirements of the low-pass filtering. To achieve a sharp transition width in the filter requires a longer convolution kernel and thus, more computation. Also the sample rate is very high before decimation, requiring yet more computational power.</p>

<p>So generally, we want the sample rate to be as low as possible at each stage. The minimum sample rate will be dictated by the Nyquist Theorem.</p>

<p>What we can do instead is use a less sharp filter, then decimate, then another less sharp filter, then decimate again, and so on. There's a further advantage here in that the tails of the filter can extend beyond the output bandwidth such that they alias or ""wrap around"", since further filtering and decimation steps will remove that aliasing. The filter just needs to be narrow enough to avoid aliasing into what will eventually be the passband.</p>

<p>Thus by filtering and decimating in multiple stages we can use fast filters where the sample rate is high, and put the more expensive filters with the sharper transition where the sample rate is low.</p>

<p>In this particular case, the aim was to get from a sample rate of 20M to 480k. That's a ratio of:</p>

<p>$$ 20000000 / 480000 \approx 41.666 $$</p>

<p>We can't decimate by fractional samples, so we must write that as a ratio of integers:</p>

<p>$$ {20000000 \over 480000} = {500 \over 12} $$</p>

<p>GNU Radio's low-pass filter block can perform decimation but not interpolation, so we can refactor that fraction as:</p>

<p>$$ {20000000 \over 480000} = {100 \over 1} \cdot {5 \over 12} $$</p>

<p>Since 5 is prime, that 5/12 fraction can't be refactored any more. We usually don't want to interpolate any more than we need to since that just creates more data that must be processed, so this is the cheapest way to do it. And you'll notice these numbers (100, 5, 12) match the parameters in your blocks.</p>

<p>The FM demodulator further decimates its audio output after demodulation by a factor of 10 to get 48kHz since this is a common audio rate, and covers the entire range of human hearing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>would it make a difference if I change audio decimation to 1 in WBFM Receive and change the decimation to 50 in rational resampler block?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This would reduce the sample rate into the WBFM demodulator to 48k. On the plus side, it will require less computational power with the lower sample rate.</p>

<p>However, the passband of the low-pass filter upstream is 75k, with a transition of 25k. That means the signal coming out of that filter has a bandwidth of:</p>

<p>$$ 2(75 + 25) = 200\:\mathrm{kHz} $$</p>

<p>Thus, it can't be represented with a sample rate less that 200k. If you were to decimate this to 48k the excess bandwidth would cause aliasing, and you'd be feeding the demodulator garbage.</p>

<p>There's a local 25.000 MHz reference transmitter which has good local coverage, and I'd like to receive that. In addition I'd like to build a version for 28 MHz to receive a local amateur beacon and my own testing transmissions.</p>

<ol>
<li>Use Arduino (Atmel) to control DDS chip to generate 25MHz + - 77.5KHz</li>
<li>Use mixer circuit taken out of Hamitup or similar. Simple transitor, FET, MosFet or diode also ok (for local transmitter)  </li>
<li>The 25MHz signal, now shifted to 77.5KHz, can be feed to a 'standard DCF77 receiver' (below and also many design on web) which presumably have some degree of band pass filtering in the front end. </li>

"How would a time-difference-of-arrival receiver with two antennas know which side the signal is from?","1310","","<p>An easy <a href=""http://byonics.com/tdoa/"" rel=""noreferrer"">TDOA design by Byonics</a> was published with the following schematic:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VxP5H.png"" alt=""Two dipole antennas with a diode switcher controlled by a microcontroller feeding a radio""></p>

<p>It appears that the antennas are switched at a rate of 640Hz, which allows a 640Hz tone to be heard in the radio when the antennas are not in phase.  When the antennas are equidistant from the RF source, the tone goes away, so by turning the antenna and finding the null you can determine the direction of the source.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://byonics.com/tdoa/"" rel=""noreferrer"">author's description</a> further explains:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that the transmitter being on that perpendicular line means that it could either be directly ahead, or directly behind. You would need to move some distance along the line of the antennas and take another bearing to determine which direction the transmitter actually was. In the next version, <strong>when the audio from the receiver is fed back into the chip and analyzed, it will be able to tell if the signal is coming from the left or right</strong> when the tone is present, and light the appropriate LED. <sub><sup>(emphasis added)</sup></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>With the radio's audio going into the microcontroller, and the antennas out of phase with the source, what is the microcontroller looking for, or how would it tell, whether the signal is coming from the right or the left of the dipole array?</p>
","<p>When the tone is present, it is because the antennas are out of phase. One antenna's signal will be leading the other; which one is leading depends on which one is closer to the transmitter (provided that the antennas are less than 1/2 wavelength apart, so that the phase difference will always be less than 180°).</p>

<p>When we switch from the lagging signal to the leading signal (for example), the phase of the switched signal jumps ahead; equivalently, the <em>frequency</em> of the signal increases for an instant and then returns to normal. The same but inverted applies to switching from the leading signal to a lagging signal. The output of a FM receiver is determined by the frequency of the input, so we get a result like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UBfcS.png"" alt=""""></p>

<p>The green waveform is the switch control and the blue waveform is the demodulated signal (the frequency deviation). After audio-frequency filtering on the output, we get a more ordinary tone, though with a delay introduced by the filter:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4REOw.png"" alt=""""></p>

<p>If the time delays of the arriving signal are the other way around, then the phase shifts are opposite, and the audio signal is negated — or, equivalently, phase shifted by 180°.</p>

<p>Therefore, to distinguish between left and right (that is, left signal leading vs. right signal leading) one need merely compare the phase of the audio signal to the phase of the switching signal; there are only two possible results (except when the audio tone is absent and the phase is therefore undefined).</p>

<p>Note that the exact phase difference found will depend on all delays in the system, including in the external receiver; but that would be simple to calibrate for.</p>

<hr>

<p>I have built a simulation of this system using <a href=""http://gnuradio.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">GNU Radio</a>, and used it to produce the plots shown and confirm that the technique can produce a reliable left/right indication (at least for an unmodulated input). Here are the <a href=""http://switchb.org/kpreid/2014/df-tdoa/tdoa.grc"" rel=""noreferrer"">GNU Radio Companion file</a> and <a href=""http://switchb.org/kpreid/2014/df-tdoa/tdoa.py"" rel=""noreferrer"">generated Python program</a> (GNU Radio 3.7+ required). </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qDnRb.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Note that while the RF sections of this simulation use complex (analytic) signals, there is nothing in those sections which would make a difference from the results obtained by using real signals at a nonzero IF as usual analog RF electronics do.</p>

<hr>

<p>On the other hand, in the perpendicular direction, it is not possible to distinguish the front and back sides; there is a fundamental ambiguity due to the symmetry of the antenna array. No direction finding system can distinguish between directions in which its antennas are symmetrical; the asymmetry which allows the discrimination described here comes from the switching of the antennas rather than their shape.</p>

","<p>General walkie-talkie radios are illegal in Japan. Even so in my military days there we used to use the ones on base in our cars when we traveled. They were not visible and we used head sets while driving. That being said we never got caught. At that time I did not even know they were not legal. Amateur is huge in Japan. I talk to people via echolink often. One fellow lives in Okinawa but was born and raised not far from where I was stationed. I catch him on a Hiroshima repeater just west of the city. He often talks to truck drivers who are licensed in Japan and they use mobiles in their rigs. But then they are doing it all legal. So without an amateur license, you run the risk of being busted. My recommendation is that  you stick to cell phones. If you happen to get out of cell range for some reason, a radio back up would be nice but if you get caught, you pay the price. In Japan that could be very costly. Play by the rules and be safe.</p>

"Single Side Band AM vs FM","1302","","<p>I know the difference between AM and FM, but could anyone explain to me what is the differences between single side band AM and conventional FM?</p>

<p>So far as I know the SSB modulation will reduce the transmitting power. But what is the exact function of SSB AM compared to FM ?</p>

<p>Hope someone can explain to me, thank you!</p>
","<p>First of all, you're not 100% right that SSB will reduce transmit power. </p>

<p>I often keep talking on SE about power spectral density. So let me start with that again and first assume that we have a radio that has fixed output power of 100 W.</p>

<p>So let's first take a (simplified) look at AM:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8l0kd.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8l0kd.png"" alt=""AM spectrum""></a>
We have a carrier and two sidebands. One sideband, the part in red on the picture,  actually carries useful information. The carrier is not needed, if we can precisely tune to the frequency, and the other sideband is just a copy of the red sideband. What is important is that when we sum the power over the frequency, we'd get the full power that the transmitter can provide. 
So for 3 kHz of audio bandwidth, we have 6 kHz of RF bandwidth and 100 watts unevenly spread out over that range.</p>

<p>Now when we're looking into SSB, first we need to better define AM. The usual colloquial AM is actually amplitude modulation, double sideband with carrier. </p>

<p>SSB is also AM, just as you mentioned, but it's amplitude modulation, single sideband with suppressed carrier.
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kqu1R.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kqu1R.png"" alt=""SSB spectrum""></a></p>

<p>In this case, for 3 kHz of audio bandwidth, we'll have our 100 W spread over not 6 kHz, but just 3 kHz. Furthermore, the carrier is eliminated as well, reducing the wasted power even more. Also, only the useful information from the red sideband is transmitted. So we can either run SSB at lower power, and get same useful density as with AM, or we can run SSB at high power and get much higher density compared to AM, resulting in better signal. </p>

<p>In case of FM, we'll get a symmetrical spectrum again:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/mVomU.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/mVomU.png"" alt=""FM spectrum""></a> </p>

<p>In this case, we'll usually get wider spectrum than usual AM which will be from around 10 kHz (European CB) to 25 kHz (older ""wideband"" FM transceivers, still used for amateur radio in some areas). The usual formula is BW=2*(Baudio+MaxDeviation). So for our 3 kHz of audio and deviation of 2 kHz, we'll need 2*(3+2)=10 kHz of bandwidth. It should also be noted that until recently, it was difficult to get low deviation values.</p>

<p>So again, we'll be spreading out our 100 W over wider bandwidth. On the other hand, FM does not suffer from the same issues as the AM does, so we basically get better audio quality from FM than we get from AM. The downside is that FM requires ""large"" bandwidth, resulting in lower power spectral density at the receiver. For line-of-sight communications, usually, the received power is more-or-less OK, so we can afford to waste some bandwidth for higher audio quality. </p>

<p>On the other hand, when we need to cover grater distances, this can be an issue, and that's why SSB is often used. On shortwave, we also have the problem of bandwidth. One FM channel is around 3 SSB channels, so in cases where bandwidth is highly constrained, FM can be a problem.</p>

<p>So why aren't we just using wide SSB on VHF/UHF, where we have plenty of bandwidth?<br>
Well, the reasons are a bit historical. Basically, FM is much more immune to badly adjusted transmitters and receiver frequencies, compared to SSB and it's more difficult to create stable frequency reference in a mobile rig.   Furthermore, up until recently, it was a bit hard to make a small, compact, SSB transceiver. In the meantime, FM infrastructure already entrenched itself, so there's not as much demand for such devices.</p>

"Buddipole model comparison","1295","","<p>Can anyone give me some insight into the different <a href=""http://www.buddipole.com/"">Buddipole</a> models available? They look pretty similar to me except for the sizes. What would make you choose one over the other?</p>
","<p>I own some of Buddipole products.</p>

<p>Buddipole is really a system rather than a product per say.  It's based around being able to create an effective antenna that is both portable and has flexibility for configuration.  </p>

<p>The real heart of the system is the VersaTee and the fact that all the parts for all the products use the same size threaded connector.  All the pieces are made light for portability and the sizes are such that you can construct a variety of <em>effective</em> antennas based on your situation.  </p>

<p>With a more typical product, you have, say, a portable 10m dipole, period.  With any of the three main Buddipole packages, you have the parts to make a number of types of antennas: vertical, dipole, even a yagi (with a few extra parts) on any of the ham bands (except 160m).  </p>

<p>So really before answering the question of which one to buy, you have to identify how you are going to use it and what bands you plan to work.  I really encourage you to download and read the free book <a href=""http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/buddipole/buddipoleinthefield2.pdf"">Buddipole in the Field</a> by NE1RD.  It's great.  This guy took the Buddipole system through about every conceivable configuration and measured the results.  Each section ends with a ""cookbook"" show the best recipe for each band.</p>

<p>For my needs, I wanted to operate portable (SOTA) on 10m, 15m &amp; 20m.  So, using the information in the book, I bought the 8' mast, the VersaTee, the Coax and the radial connectors.  I didn't need the coils or the tripod, so I saved a ton of money versus the deluxe package.  For the radiator, I used the MFJ 17' telescoping whip, which is full sized for 20m (and of course on 10, 12 and 15 by retracting some of it).  I used the radial connectors to connect 4 elevated radials to the sides of the VersaTee, two off each side.  These are supported at the ends by 2' fiberglass rods (former 4' driveway markers, $1.99@).</p>

<p>Packed up for the trip, the whip sides into the hollow center of the mast and the 4 2' rods are strapped to that making a nice compact bundle.  Everything else is just wire and rope and 3 stakes all of which fits in a large ZipLock bag.</p>

<p>Does it work?  When I set everything up for 20m in my backyard, I got through to a station  from Venezuala on the second call QRP from suburban Maryland and got a 59 even after telling him my setup.</p>

"Signal Source Block of GNU Radio","1290","","<p>GNU Radio has a Signal Source Block which considers a set of variables to produce an output, namely sample rate, frequency and amplitude.</p>

<p>In signal processing, we define a basic waveform by its frequency, number of samples within the period and its amplitude. This holds true for waveforms such as Sine, Cosine, etc.</p>

<p>IN GNU Radio, the sample rate doesn't really mean sample rate. And the frequency does not mean the frequency of the signal. This is really confusing to understand. I insert a screenshot of my build below</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pBc7I.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pBc7I.png"" alt=""GNU Radio companion showing the flow graph: Signal Source -&gt;  Throttle -&gt; WX GUI FFT Sink""></a></p>

<p>My question is, if sample rate is defined in the signal generator box, we do not need another throttle box. Because the Signal Generation box must know that it shouldnt generate more than the amount of samples its adviced in the configuration. However, if we remove the Throttle Box, the CPU goes to 100% and PC gets Stuck.</p>

<p>I would like a bit of clarification of on this issue. Im sure I am wrong. People who made GNU radio must have been very smart people who have had a specific reason for doing this. I would like to know that reason. </p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
","<p>You're on to something very right! </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In signal processing, we define a basic waveform by its frequency, number of samples within the period and its amplitude. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'd go a step further: In digital signal processing, the actual frequency doesn't ""exist"" any more. It's just ""a periodic signal with a period of $T$ samples"".</p>

<p>So that's exactly why for example digital filters are usually denoted relative to half the sampling frequency $f_s$ or simply $\pi$.</p>

<p>So that's exactly what the signal source does: It just takes your input of sampling rate and signal frequency, calculates $\frac{f_{sig}}{f_s}$ – and gets a value for how many samples a period should have (or how much of $2\pi$ to advance phase per sample – which is really nothing but just dividing $2\pi$ by that number).</p>

<p>Thus, a signal source configured with $f_{sig}=10,\, f_s = 100$ does <em>exactly</em> the same that a signal source with $f_{sig}=0.2,\, f_s = 2$ does. </p>

<p>GNU Radio doesn't even have any notion of what this sampling rate means – it just processes samples as fast as it can. That might seem strange at first, but when you think about it, every block that takes a ""sampling rate"" parameter just needs that value to ""interpret"" some other frequency (or time) with respect to that.</p>

<p>In a flowgraph where there is some SDR or other sampling device (an <em>osmocom source</em> getting data from an RTL-SDR, or the <em>USRP Sink</em> bringing samples to an USRP, or just an <em>Audio Sink</em> that attaches to a speaker, to give three examples), the samples actually only start flowing at the sampling rate physically in the hardware – GNU Radio still tries to get/give the samples as fast as possible.</p>

<p>For hardware sources, the mechanism is simple: GNU Radio asks the source ""hey, do you have $N$ samples for me"", to which the source usually responds as fast as it can, i.e. it will output the sampling rate of samples per second on average (but in ""chunks"" – GNU Radio doesn't push singular samples around. That would be far too much overhead). That limits the average rate of samples flowing through a flow graph; still, the pure software blocks will take these samples and process them as fast as possible, and then wait for the next chunk. That allows for maximum throughput – everyone works as fast as possible, and if they're done early, that's good (in fact, necessary), because it frees CPU to let the other blocks do their work, the OS do its job and so on.</p>

<p>Now, a hardware sink will simply take some time, the number of samples offered per iteration divided by the sampling rate, to consume the samples. That will simply put ""pressure"" on the buffers (GNU Radio buffers, ie. what connects blocks with each other are simply of limited size), because when a buffer gets full, the block that puts samples into that buffer simply doesn't get asked to do that until there's enough space in there again.</p>

<p>So, that's the situation with hardware blocks in your flow graph. Now, with software-only blocks, there's nothing slowing down the flow of samples – no hardware source that simply doesn't give your more than its physical  sampling rate, and no sink that doesn't consume samples any faster.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8v53w.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8v53w.png"" alt=""Minimal flow graph""></a></p>

<p>Thus, in your flow graph (without the <em>Throttle</em>), GNU Radio simply asks the <em>Signal Source</em> to produce as many samples as there's free space in its output buffer. The <em>Signal Source</em> happily obliges and fills that buffer with a cosine of 32 samples per period – and then tells GNU Radio it's done doing that and it in fact did produce so-and-so-many samples. GNU Radio takes that info and tells the GUI Sink ""Hey, there's so-and-so-many samples in your input buffer, get to work!"", and the sink just goes ahead and processes these as fast as it can. It signals GNU Radio when it's done how many of the samples that it was offered it actually consumed – and GNU Radio then knows that this portion of the buffer is free again</p>

<p>Since that happens as fast as possible, this flow graph tends to eat up two processor cores completely, because GNU Radio is clever and maximizes throughput by distributing different blocks to different concurrent threads – that way, the source can already be producing the next chunk of samples, while the sink is still consuming the first one, leading to a scenario where there's practically no waiting for new input – there's always something to be done. Again, in a scenario where you want to process millions of samples per second coming from a hardware source, or going to a hardware sink, this is <strong>very</strong> desirable – simply because the throughput would be hard to achieve if everyone would be waiting most of the time instead of everyone trying to work as fast as possible on their own CPU core.</p>

<p><em>Throttle</em> does exactly <em>nothing</em> to the samples. It's really just a ""copy the bytes from the input to the output buffer"" operation. But it just lets that copy action sleep() for a while to achieve an <em>average</em> throughput of the sample rate you configured. It's thus really just a tool for simulation at medium rates. Never use <em>Throttle</em> in conjunction with a hardware block – no two clocks are exactly the same, and if your hardware samples but a little faster than your Throttle throttles (because that's done with a rather inaccurate CPU clock time), you'll end up damaging your signal somewhere, either because your hardware sink didn't get things fast enough and had nothing to convert to analog when it was time, or because your hardware source completely runs out of buffers to put received samples to, and has to drop them.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<h1>Takeaway</h1>

<p>It's important to know that GNU Radio, and DSP in general, don't care about real-world sampling rates at all. It's just math applied to a sequence of numbers. How fast that sequence passes through the processing doesn't matter to the results of the math – the only point when these numbers get a physical meaning, and hence, a real sampling rate, again, is when they're passed to or from some sampling hardware.

"How is the FM-signal demodulated in my receiver?","1286","","<p>I've built a radio receiver and I'm wondering how the demodulation works here. I think it's done by T1 and T2 (I've used BC547 instead of BF494, they're quite similar), but I'd like to know more about it.<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ogbb4.jpg"" alt=""small fm radio circuit schematic"">

","<p>Essentially, it is an FM to AM converter, followed by an AM detector, followed by an audio amplifier.</p>

<p>The heart of this circuit is C1 and L. Together, these make a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LC_circuit#Parallel_LC_circuit"" rel=""noreferrer"">parallel LC circuit</a>. At resonance, this looks like a very high (for ideal components, infinite) impedance. Away from resonance, the impedance decreases and becomes more inductive or capacitive.</p>



<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NyzoD.png"" alt=""schematic""></p>



<p><sup><a href=""/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fNyzoD.png"">simulate this circuit</a> &ndash; Schematic created using <a href=""https://www.circuitlab.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">CircuitLab</a></sup></p>

<p>Our circuit will mostly be operating at or very near resonance, so the reactive part of the impedance is negligible. Instead, we can think of the parallel LC circuit as a variable resistor, the resistance of which varies with frequency.</p>

<p>You might see where this is going: if we can design an amplifier and use this LC circuit to set the gain, then changes in frequency change the gain, and thus, the amplitude. Then we'd have an FM to AM converter.</p>

<p>T1 and T2 form that amplifier. Specifically, they are a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regenerative_circuit"" rel=""noreferrer"">regenerative circuit</a>. Regenerative circuits use positive feedback to increase gain beyond what would be possible with a single active device. They are very much like oscillators. Like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_oscillator"" rel=""noreferrer"">oscillators</a>, they require feedback with a 360° (or equivalently, 0°) phase shift. Unlike an oscillator, we want the gain to be less than 1 (but very close). If it's more than 1, then we have an oscillator and we've actually made a transmitter.</p>



<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UNxnR.png"" alt=""schematic""></p>



<p><sup><a href=""/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fUNxnR.png"">simulate this circuit</a></sup></p>

<p>Let's consider what the AC signal from the antenna does to this circuit. When the antenna voltage rises, T2 turns on more, lowering its collector voltage (that's an inversion, or a 180° phase shift). This in turn decreases the base current of T1, increasing T1's collector voltage (another 180°). Thus, these two transistors form a positive-feedback amplifier.</p>

<p>The gain depends on LC. Near resonance, LC is a very high impedance and gain is at a maximum. Away from resonance, LC is a lower impedance and the gain decreases.</p>

<p>This forms an FM -> AM converter: at resonance (tuned to the center frequency of the station) amplitude is at a maximum, and as the carrier deviates away from this center, the amplitude decreases. Other stations are far enough away from resonance that the gain is very low, and they have very little effect on the circuit.</p>

<p>From here on out it works just like an AM radio. The output of the oscillator (taken off the base of T2) can only sink current and not source it: this provides the rectification. That rectification in combination with C2 and R1 forms an envelope detector. IC1 is just an audio amplifier.</p>

<p>And there you have it. A dead-simple, direct-conversion, regenerative FM receiver.</p>

I'm thinking to do a 3-element 2M and a 5-element 70cm design, and I'd like to make the entire thing no more than 36"" long.  Each antenna is individually ~20"", which obviously won't fit in 36"".  Can I place the director of the 2M antenna ahead of some of the elements of the 440?  Ideally, this would be between D1 and D2 on the smaller yagi.</p>

<p>I'm not sure how much impact the variously sized pieces of metal would have on each other, my biggest concern is that the 2M director would act as a reflector in front of the 70cm driven element.  If this isn't possible, I'll probably just build the 2 + 5 pictured to keep it portable.</p>
","<p>You can't just mix the antennas together without doing a lot of work in simulation to make all the interaction work properly.</p>

<p>As you suspected, the longer 2m elements will upset the 70cm antenna.</p>

<p>However, as they are completely separate antennas on the same boom, if you tilt one so they are 90 degrees apart, they will not interact at all, and you can squeeze them onto a shorter boom. In other words, looking from the front, they form a cross.
This won't be as easy to handle or store, so you might want to find a way to fold the elements of the 2m antenna.
Make sure that no elements touch or get too close. Keep the baluns apart too, perhaps one forward and one backward.</p>

<p>Simulating antennas is fun, but it's a long journey, quite a lot of work for one yagi. The easy-to-use packages cost more than a car, and the free ones are harder to learn. My advice is to start with a published design from a reputable source and build it carefully.</p>

  meaning, except as otherwise provided herein; obscene or indecent
  words or language; or false or deceptive messages, signals or
  identification.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Looking around, the best I could find is that this rule is intended to prevent general purpose broadcasting, specifically with the purpose to entertain. </p>

<p>From this website, there is an interesting <a href=""http://nonbovine-ruminations.blogspot.com/2010/01/more-things-you-can-do-on-amateur-radio.html"">quote on music</a>. I wouldn't take this as law, but it is worth considering:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Similarly, the transmission of music is also prohibited (with one
  exception: music incidental to an authorized retransmission of
  communications from the Space Shuttle is permitted).  However, there
  is reportedly a ruling that one ham singing ""Happy Birthday"" on the
  air to another ham does not count as the ""transmission of music"",
  presumably because most hams seem to be unable to sing.  Again, this
  is a non-compete regulation; if you want to transmit music the FCC
  wants you to use the broadcast service or a low power service to
  accomplish your purpose, not amateur radio.  If your interest in radio
  is to be an on-air DJ, again, amateur radio might not be for you, and
  you should consider looking elsewhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bottom line, if something that is purely incidental to the conversation, or if you are transmitting it digitally, you can actually have a bit of music and not get your hand slapped by the FCC. Thus, the doorbell seems fine, and most likely the types of ""Windows Sounds"" that sometimes come up, but personally, I wouldn't risk it. If you are trying to broadcast then you are almost certainly in violation of the law.</p>

"What is the difference between a scanner and a receiver?","1272","","<p>What is the difference between a scanner and a receiver?</p>
","<p><strong>A scanner is a specialized receiver</strong> with features for effectively monitoring many frequencies, classically by tuning to each in rapid succession (scanning) and stopping when a signal is found, then continuing when the signal ends. The scan function can of course be disabled to use it as a receiver for a single channel.</p>

<p>Scanners as commonly discussed are typically used to monitor the communications of public safety services (police, fire department, etc.) because those organizations use many two-way radios on many channels transmitting intermittently. Modern scanners may include the ability to monitor “trunked” radio systems, which have a centralized control channel containing frequency allocations which the individual users' radios automatically follow; this is a feature which is generally unique to scanners as opposed to other types of receivers.</p>

<p>However, scanning is also an incidental feature on many digitally controlled receivers or transceivers — not what they're sold for, but a convenient extra.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>On amateur radio transceivers, scanning is useful to efficiently monitor many memorized local repeaters or simplex frequencies, or to continuously sweep across a HF band rather than having to spin the big knob by hand.</p></li>
<li><p>Car stereos have scan functions, which you can use when you're out of your usual area to find stations. In addition to an actual scan button, there's probably a function to find the next adjacent station, skipping over dead channels — this is also based on scanning.</p></li>

","<p>I have read this too.  I don't have personal data to back this up, but the reasoning I have read stated that local RFI (like household appliances) tended to be vertically polarized and hence more able to induce noise onto a vertical antenna than a horizontal one.

</blockquote>

<p>Is it possible to follow these directions with a KPC-9612+?</p>
","<p><strong>RX audio:</strong> The FT-7900R has separate audio outputs for RX audio on the DIN connector for 1200 and 9600, so those can be simply wired to the two separate KPC-9612+ ports.</p>

<p><strong>PTT:</strong> The PTT line has a little voltage provided by the radio, and the TNC's PTT pin grounds that pin to transmit. You can directly wire both TNC port PTTs to the radio, and it'll transmit when either of the TNC ports ground the pin.</p>

<p><strong>TX audio:</strong> The correct method would be to provide some mixing circuit to mix the audio signal outputs of the TNC. Some audio level loss is OK, since you can compensate by adjusting the output level of the TNC up, so a passive circuit is good. The most important thing is that the mixing may not affect the frequency response, since it's quite important for good 9600 bit/s operation. Simply wiring both the 9600 and 1200 bit/s audio outputs of the TNC together might work, or it might not, depending on the type of the outputs on the TNC. A simple resistor mixer might work better.</p>

<p>It's probably obvious, but you'll have to make sure the two TNC ports don't transmit at the same time - the transmit audio, mixed 1200/9600 data, would not make any sense.</p>

","<p><strong>No.</strong> Many types of antennas may be unsuitable for transmitting.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A so-called <em>active antenna</em> contains an integrated low-noise amplifier (LNA) for amplifying weak signals. (<strong>This is very common for GPS antennas.</strong>) This amplifier cannot pass a signal in reverse, and could be damaged by transmit power levels appearing on its output. It is possible to have an automatic switch to bypass the LNA when transmitting, but this feature would not be designed into an antenna meant for receiving.</p></li>
<li><p>Some designs of antenna, such as the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverage_antenna"" rel=""nofollow"">Beverage antenna</a>, contain resistors or other dissipative elements. If they are used for transmitting, the resistor must be capable of dissipating a certain fraction of the power input to the antenna. This is inefficient since that fraction of power is not transmitted, and requires a resistor which will not be destroyed by the heat.</p></li>
<li><p>A receiving antenna may <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_antenna#Small_loop_receiving_antennas"" rel=""nofollow"">contain a ferrite element</a>, which allows it to be much more efficient when receiving than its size would otherwise permit, but which will <em>saturate</em> at any significant power, becoming nonlinear and creating harmonic distortion (as well as heat).</p></li>
<li><p>A transmitter requires <em>impedance matching</em> between the final power amplifier and the antenna. An antenna's impedance varies with frequency, so it has some frequency range over which there is an acceptable match. The same antenna can be used for receiving over a much wider range; antennas used solely for receiving may be deliberately mismatched vs. the intended band to gain other advantages such as being physically small.</p>

<p>An antenna with the wrong impedance at the desired frequency <em>can</em> be matched using a matching network or <em>antenna tuner</em> (adjustable matching network), but this is still less efficient because there will be additional losses.</p>

<p>This is the least significant problem of all those I have listed: with a good antenna tuner, just about any chunk of metal insulated from other objects can be used as an antenna. The problem comes when non-metallic elements are in circuit as in the other cases.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Since you mention GPS in particular:</p>

<p>You cannot repeat a GPS signal usefully. Or rather, if you did, it would cause your GPS receiver to think it is at the position of the original receiving antenna, not its actual location. (This is because GPS operates by analyzing the combination of signals from multiple satellites, and this combination happens in the receiving antenna.)</p>

<p>It would also be likely illegal to operate such a transmitter, because you are transmitting on frequencies you do not have permission to and interfering with normal GPS operation.</p>

"What is a linear RF amplifier?","1196","","<p>Most of the RF amplifiers advertised, and most of the questions about amplifiers, are ""linear"" amplifiers.</p>

<p>What is a linear amplifier, and what other common amplifier type(s) exist that requires people to say ""linear"" every time they talk about RF amplifiers?</p>
","<p>Google defines ""linear"" as ""arranged in or extending along a straight or nearly straight line."" Wikipedia tells me that ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearity"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">linearity</a> refers to a function or relationship which can be graphically represented as a straight line"". Such systems can be described by an equation of the form $y=mx+b$.</p>

<p>In the case of RF amplifiers, the relationship is the input voltage vs. the output voltage. The output is identical to the input, only ""louder"". Mathematically, $V_{out} = A \cdot V_{in} + 0$, where $A$ is the voltage gain of the amplifier.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>Linearity is a generally desirable property but it comes at the cost of reduced efficiency. At any instant, the amplifier's output is probably something somewhere between its power supply rails, and consequently, the output transistors will have some voltage $E$ across them and some current $I$ through them. The rate of electrical energy consumption is the product of these two: $P=IE$. That consumed energy can't vanish: it's converted into heat. This requires big heatsinks, and it drains your batteries faster or runs up your electric bill.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>Here's a solution to the heat problem: we amplify the input signal so much that the output is always greater than the supply rails. Now we are effectively connecting the load directly to one supply rail or the other. Now the output transistors either have 0V across it,<sup>3</sup> or are passing no current. Thus, the power ($P=IE$) in the transistors is low because always either current or voltage is nearly 0. The energy is going to the antenna, not to heating the transistors.</p>

<p>The problem is now that the output is horribly distorted. If the input was a nice clean sine wave, the output will be a square wave, full of odd harmonics. We can remove<sup>4</sup> the harmonics with a filter, and because the filter is made of reactive components like inductors and capacitors which alternately store and release electrical energy, rather than converting it to heat, they don't get so hot, and the amplifier is more efficient.</p>

<p>This mostly solves the distortion problem, but something is lost: the amplitude of the input signal. Fortunately, the frequency is preserved.</p>

<p>So now we know when non-linear amplifiers are acceptable: when the amplitude of the signal is insignificant, such as FM, or frequency modulated digital modulations like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency-shift_keying"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FSK</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-shift_keying#SOQPSK"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">some PSK flavors</a>, or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum-shift_keying"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GMSK</a>. Modes where amplitude is significant like AM, SSB, or digital modulations like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrature_amplitude_modulation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">QAM</a> require a linear amplifier.</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1: RF amps tend not be to be marketed by their voltage gain, but by their maximum power output. Assuming a 50 ohm load, power is related to voltage by $P=E^2/50\Omega$. Take the output power and the input power, calculate the associated voltages, and the ratio of the two is the voltage gain of the amp.</sup></p>

<p><sup>2: To dive more deeply into the reasons linear electronic circuits make waste heat, check out <a href=""https://electronics.stackexchange.com/q/18478/17608"">My linear voltage regulator is overheating very fast</a> on electronics.SE. Though that's about voltage regulators, the problem is common to a broad class of linear electronic circuits. You can also read about <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier#Power_amplifier_classes"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">power amplifier classes</a>. Class AB is a common linear RF amplifier design. Class C is common for non-linear amps.</sup></p>

<p><sup>3: Real transistors will always have some small voltage across them, even when fully on, which means they will get a little warm. This is far better than the a lot warm they get in a linear amplifier, however.</sup></p>

<p><sup>4: really, just attenuate. Significantly and sufficiently. All amplifiers output harmonic distortion of some degree, and regulatory agencies regulate the maximum allowable harmonic distortion.</sup></p>

"How far does an antenna need to be from metal to avoid problems?","1188","","<p>Living in an apartment, I'm struggling to get good antennas set up, especially for HF.  Worse yet, I'm not allowed external antennas (but am willing to try something low profile on the balcony), my apartment is built with stucco (with the ""chicken wire"" embedded in it), and my window frames are all aluminum.  I have a balcony, but it's got a low (3') wall made of stucco inside and out (2 layers of mesh!) topped with a metal railing.</p>

<p>I tried a dual-hamstick dipole for 20M, but was placing it only 24"" over the balcony floor, and this is below the edge of the wall.  Tuning it was basically impossible, though I eventually could get 2:1 at one frequency.  The balcony is about 4 feet deep and 10 feet long, and there is another floor above mine (so no roof access, and there's poured concrete above).</p>

<p>So how far away does metal have a significant impact on my antennas?  I'm assuming it's design- and frequency-dependent, but I'm looking for resources that can help me figure out approximate clearances that are needed.  Mostly I'd like to work at 20M, 10M, and 2M.  (My balcony is way too small to think about 40M and lower.)</p>
","<p>It sounds like any antenna you can build in this situation is going to be a compromise.</p>

<p>You can use the metal parts of your structure as part of the antenna, if that makes things easier. For example, I bet a 2m whip on the corner of the balcony could work well enough, with the metal railing being the ground ""plane"". It's far from ideal of course.</p>

"In USA, is it legal to hear police or ATC frequency?","1183","","<p>In USA, is it legal to hear police or ATC (air traffic control) frequency?</p>
","<p>In the US the answer is generally yes, you can listen to such transmissions, but local and federal laws may have some restrictions on what you can do with information gained from listening activities, and in some very specific circumstances you aren't allowed to listen at all.</p>

<p>Most of the time the restrictions only come into play when you divulge information you gained from listening to certain transmissions.</p>

<p>But there are also restrictions that disallow intercepting transmissions for one's personal gain, such as operating a taxi service, listening to the competitor's dispatcher, and acting on that information to gain a business advantage.  Alternately, there are restrictions on trying to obtain for-pay services without paying for them in certain circumstances, such as pay-tv, hold music services, and so forth even if they do not encrypt their transmissions.</p>

<p>While it's generally believed that listening to cellphone conversations is illegal, that is not generally true, and is not federally mandated. However, if you sell scanners you must restrict them from receiving in the cellular bands, for instance.  Also there are specific harsh penalties for divulging information you may learn from cellular transmissions. This makes it difficult to listen to them, or profit from listening, but doesn't necessarily make it directly illegal to listen to them.  There are additional restrictions on decoding digital transmissions, which may make it illegal with today's systems.  </p>

<p>Local laws often make it illegal to listen to law enforcement transmissions in connection with a crime.</p>

<p>However, Supreme Court rulings, FCC rules, federal laws, and local laws are open to some interpretation. The legality of listening to a particular transmission will depend on more information than you've provided.</p>

"What does the Friis transmission equation represent and how is it derived?","1175","","<p>I've read that the Friis transmission equation can be <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/a/1487/218"">applied to calculate path loss in ideal space</a>. However, I'd like to better understand the factors that define it and what it represents, and <em>why</em> it is the equation it is.</p>
","<p>Let's imagine that there are two antennas, entirely in free space. There is no Earth or any other object near enough to affect propagation. Let's also assume that these antennas are far enough apart that the antennas interact only by their <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_and_far_field"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">far fields</a>.</p>

<p>To start, let's assume that both antennas are isotropic, meaning that they radiate equally in each direction. If we supply a pulse of energy to such an antenna, this energy will spread out as a sphere, to infinity, at the speed of light. It also means that if we supply a constant power to such an antenna, then for any sized sphere centered on that antenna, the power passing through that sphere is equal to the power being fed to the antenna.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>If we are interested in the power received by an antenna at distance $r$ from the transmitting antenna, then all the transmitted power will be spread across a sphere of radius $r$ by the time it reaches the receiving antenna. The area of that sphere is $ 4 \pi r^2 $. The transmit power $P_t$ divided by that area gives us:</p>

<p>$$ P_t \over 4 \pi r^2 \tag{1} $$</p>

<p>This number has units $\mathrm W/\mathrm m^2$ and is a <em>power flux density</em> or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiance"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">irradiance</a>. A watt is one joule per second, so a power flux density of $1\mathrm W/\mathrm m^2$ means that every second, one joule of energy passes through an area of one square meter.</p>

<p>Isotropic antennas can't exist<sup>2</sup>, and even a dipole has some gain<sup>3</sup>. Assuming the receiving antenna is in the direction of maximum gain, this multiplies the power flux density, so if the transmitting antenna's gain is $G_t$, the equation becomes</p>

<p>$$ {P_t \over 4 \pi r^2} G_t \tag{2} $$</p>

<p>This gives us the power flux density at the receiving antenna, but how much of this power is received? The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antenna_aperture"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">antenna aperture</a> answers that question. Let's call the aperture of the receiving antenna $A_r$. The power received ($P_r$) is then</p>

<p>$$ P_r = {P_t \over 4 \pi r^2} G_t A_r \tag{3} $$</p>

<p>Effective aperture $A$ and gain $G$ are related by</p>

<p>$$ A = {\lambda^2 \over 4 \pi} G \tag{4} $$</p>

<p>Substituting this into equation 3 gives us</p>

<p>$$ P_r = {P_t \over 4 \pi r^2} G_t {\lambda^2 \over 4 \pi} G_r $$</p>

<p>Simplified:</p>

<p>$$ P_r = P_t G_t G_r \left({\lambda \over 4 \pi r}\right)^2 $$</p>

<p>Or rewritten to use decibels:</p>

<p>$$ P_{r(\mathrm{dB})} =
 P_{t(\mathrm{dB})}
 + G_{t(\mathrm{dB})}
 + G_{r(\mathrm{dB})}
 + 20 \log_{10} \left({\lambda \over 4 \pi r}\right) $$</p>

<p>Since wavelength is a function of frequency and the speed of light ($\lambda = c/f$), the equation can also be written:</p>

<p>$$ P_{r(\mathrm{dB})} =
 P_{t(\mathrm{dB})}
 + G_{t(\mathrm{dB})}
 + G_{r(\mathrm{dB})}
 + 20 \log_{10} \left({c \over 4 \pi r f}\right) $$</p>

<p>Finally, we can factor out the constant ${c \over 4 \pi}$ and write that as:</p>

<p>$$ P_{r(\mathrm{dB})} =
 P_{t(\mathrm{dB})}
 + G_{t(\mathrm{dB})}
 + G_{r(\mathrm{dB})}
 + 147.6
 - 20 \log_{10} (rf) $$</p>

<p>Where:</p>

<ul>
<li>$r$ is the distance between antennas in meters, and</li>
<li>$f$ is the frequency in Hz.</li>
</ul>

<p>This formula is essential to the calculation of <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/q/352/218"">link budgets</a>, and gives the best case path loss. It's then easier to consider other sources of loss as separate factors.</p>

"decibels as ratio and dBm as absolute values","1167","","<p>I am just trying to understand the nitty gritty of using decibels and absolute measurements in dBm. I see them referred to routinely in RF, and using reference sheets I can understand enough to make sense of gains and losses, but I would like instead to acquire a much better understanding for myself, being able to convert and calculate freely (without the need for reference sheets) between any power or dB value.</p>

<p>I think I understand that dB is merely a ratio of measurement. But if, for example, a component under test had 20W at its input and 15W at its output and there is an overall loss of 5W, how would that be worked out and expressed in a ratio of dB?</p>

<p>Trying to work it out I did:</p>

<pre><code>20W (in) = 10log10(20W/1W) = 13dB(W)
15W (out) = 10log10(15W/1W) = 11.76dB(W)
so, component power loss = 13dB(W) – 11.76dB(W) = 1.24dB(W)
</code></pre>

<p>However, I can see that I am merely subtracting absolute measurements still and not determining the dB ratio of power transfer efficiency or loss. If so, then what would be the equivalent dB ratio for this example?</p>

<p>In addition, I am able to convert 13dB(W) back to watts with:</p>

<pre><code>10 to the power of (13/10) or 10^1.3 = 19.95W
</code></pre>

<p>and so too for 11.76dB(W):</p>

<pre><code>10^1.176 = 14.997W
</code></pre>

<p>but for 1.24dB(W):</p>

<pre><code>10^0.124 = 1.33W
</code></pre>

<p>which does not appear correct, as I expected instead a value of ~ 5W, for which 1.24dB(W) represents between 13dB(W) and 11.76dB(W), so I unsure where I am going wrong. If someone could let me now I would sure appreciate the insight.</p>

<p>Finally, what would it mean to say a receiver has a receive level of -45dBm?</p>

<p>Is it right to conclude that such a receiver is capable of extracting information from signals received at -45dBm less power than what they (signals) were originally transmitted at? Or actually it just occurred to me that since 45dBm is an absolute value that it perhaps means that the receiver could receive signals as low as -45dBm or:</p>

<pre><code>10^(-45/10) = 0.0000316mW
</code></pre>

<p>and still be able to extract the information transmitted so long as the S/N ratio is adequate? Which if that was the case then, if one transmits a signal with 20W or 43dBm of power, then the signal could be attenuated by up to 88dBm:</p>

<pre><code>43dBm - -45dBm = 88dBm
</code></pre>

<p>and still be detected adequately enough by the receiver in question so that the original information sent is received?</p>

<p>Your error is merely in the units, not in the calculation. Taking the difference of two dBW (or any two absolute dB values <em>using the same reference level</em>) gets you dB.</p>

<p>If you want to think of this algebraically, you could use the definition</p>

<p>$$x\,\mathrm{dBW} \equiv x\,\mathrm{dB} + (1\,\mathrm{dBW})$$</p>

<p>where $(1\,\mathrm{dBW})$ can be treated as a funny-named constant we don't need to assign any numerical value to, much like <em>any other unit symbol</em> — except that we're adding, not multiplying, it, because logarithms transform multiplications to additions (basic property: $\log(a\cdot b) = \log a + \log b$). If we transform the above to non-logarithmic form, we get the trivial and obvious equation</p>

<p>$$y\,\mathrm{W} = y \cdot (1\,\mathrm{W})$$</p>

<p>Using the above definition for dBW, your calculation becomes:</p>

<p>$$
\begin{align}
&amp;\phantom{{}={}} 13\,\mathrm{dBW} - 11.76\,\mathrm{dBW} \\

&amp;= 13\,\mathrm{dB} - 11.76\,\mathrm{dB} + (1\,\mathrm{dBW}) - (1\,\mathrm{dBW}) \tag{reorder terms}\\
&amp;= 13\,\mathrm{dB} - 11.76\,\mathrm{dB} \tag{$x - x = 0$} \\

<p>The result of the subtraction <em>is</em> a ratio expressed in dB; you've just mislabeled it as being absolute.</p>

  <p>which does not appear correct, as I expected instead a value of ~ 5W</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The 1.24 value is dB, not dBW, so treating it as an absolute value does not get you the answer relative to the original power level you measured. (However, there is a meaning to the figure 1.33 W: it's the amount of power in that would be required to get 1 W of power out. You can check this against simply computing ratios with no logarithms.)</p>

<p>Remember, logarithms are simply a computational convenience. If you have a calculation starting in watts and ending in watts, then you can do the intermediate work in dBW and dB (adding and subtracting) or in power and ratios-of-power (multiplying and dividing) and get the same answer. If you don't get the same answer, you made an error in setting up the formulas.</p>

"Do I really need a side-tone oscillator?","1159","","<p>I'm throwing together bits-and-pieces towards my rig on a less than shoestring budget. It is possible to apply a take-off from the key and use it to drive a piezo-buzzer. Of course, there won't be any tone control locally. But I can live with that, or use a divider from ground to provide minimal tone control.</p>

<p>Does the side-tone oscillator serve any purpose other than allowing the operator to listen to the code being transmitted?</p>
","<p>I am assuming two things in my answer and both may be wrong assumptions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Your shoe-string budget rig is a transceiver, probably QRP, maybe even single band.</li>
<li>Rig is CW only (typical of small shoe-string budget rigs).</li>
</ol>

<p>Thus, do you really need a side-tone oscillator so that you can listen to your own sending (assuming CW).</p>

<p>In my opinion, the answer is yes.  I learned CW when I was 9 years old (or, 58 years ago) and today, my main operating mode that I use every day, is CW.  My copy speed is a comfortable 20 to 24 wpm error free but I can do contests up to 35 wpm and copy call signs (usually) at 38 to 40 wpm.  But, one thing I can't do is send without using a side tone so that I can hear what I send.  I assume you are just beginning at CW so therefore, I am pretty sure you can't effectively send without hearing what you send.</p>

<p>You ask if you can use a buzzer or some external oscillator.  Answer is yes you can.  Now, whether there would be interference in driving two separate circuits from a single switch (that is, using your single telegraph key with the transmission as well as separate side tone oscillator depends on the circuits themselves.  A high-impedance interface to the side-tone oscillator should be safe (~10 times higher than the impedance of the keying circuit of the transmitter unless that impedance is also high).</p>

<p>You will be missing a nice feature of the built-in side tone oscillator and that is the ability to zero-beat a signal.  Actually, there are people who can do this accurately without a side-tone generator but I can't (though, haven't tried in years).  But, if you are a beginner at CW, then maybe zero beating a signal is not the most important feature.  If you were to participate in CW traffic nets (as I do) then the net control would often require zero beat (or, ask for it).  They will send out QNZ which means ""Zero Beat your frequency with mine"".</p>

<p>If you fail to zero beat a signal it is possible that you may not be heard if you send to him (or, her).  The reason is that he may have squeezed down his filters to a point that you have to be very close to his frequency in order to be heard.  For example, when I am on the hunt for CW stations, I keep my filter fairly wide at 1 KHz.  But, once the QSO starts I narrow down my filter to anywhere between 200 and 400 Hz.  If you are more than 400 Hz away in that situation then I probably would not hear you.  Now, I use a K3 that has nice sharp roofing filters: 200 Hz, 400 Hz, 1000 Hz, 1800 Hz, and 2700 Hz.  Note that my rig does not do AM since I took out my 6000 Hz AM filter.</p>

<p>As I said, my rig is an Elecraft K3 and it has a nifty feature.  It can do a zero beat on the incoming signal by the mere push of a button (called the Spot button).  I also have an LED display that shows how far off (low or high side) from center frequency that the signal is which is kind of nice.  And, I have the P3 pan adapter that allows me to sort of zero beat visually on the screen.  Nice rig but often never a first rig.</p>

"Where are the baluns for VHF and higher? How can one be made?","1159","","<p>In <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/questions/7223/unexpected-resonance-dual-band-dipole"">another question</a>, commenters recommended that I look into adding a 1:1 balun to a dual-band dipole to eliminate the feedline as a radiator. As I understand it, a 1:1 balun also functions as a choke, but is more efficient because... reasons?</p>

<p>When I try to find plans to build a balun, they all seem to specify a frequency range of 1.6-30MHz. Why is that and how can I make a balun that will work on VHF and UHF?</p>
","<p>Let's clarify some terminology: a balun is any device used to convert between a balanced system (ladder line, dipoles) and an unbalanced one (coax, vertical monopoles). There are a lot of ways to make a balun, and a common-mode choke is one of them. A choke can also be used in balanced to balanced, or unbalanced to unbalanced connections where suppression of common-mode currents is merited.</p>

<p>The choke approach (or ""current balun"" as you'll sometimes hear it described) is nice because it's small, easy to fabricate, broadband, and low-loss. ""Small"" is especially an advantage on HF where other balun designs would be huge.</p>

<p>Ferite-wound chokes can be done on VHF as well. Jim Brown, K9YC has some <a href=""http://audiosystemsgroup.com/RFI-Ham.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">measured data on ferrites</a>. Look for page 49. His data show that Fair-Rite mixes 31, 43, and 61 can all be made to work. He shows for a T240 core of any of those mixes, you can get about 600Ω on 2m with 2 turns, and 300Ω with one turn on 70cm.</p>

<p>However, the effective permeability of ferrites drops with increasing frequency, so it becomes difficult to get a sufficiently high choking impedance for the choke to function effectively as a balun. 300Ω isn't great but might be sufficient for some applications. You can always <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/q/1271/218"">measure and see</a>.</p>

<p>One approach is to keep the system unbalanced all the way. If you have an unbalanced coax feedline, then put an unbalanced monopole antenna on it.</p>

<p>The three drooping wires are the ""ground plane"". Drooping them increases the feedpoint impedance from the 37Ω of a monopole on a flat ground plane to 50Ω for a better match. Since the ground plane presents a very low impedance to the ground currents, that's where most of the current will flow. The coax common-mode is a relatively high impedance.</p>

<p>Some antenna designs which aren't simple monopoles use a ""skirt"" which looks like radials on a monopole. As in the monopole, the skirt looks like a low impedance ground plane, and the feedline is ""hidden"" under it. </p>

<p>Other designs are the <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/q/3591/218"">folded balun</a>, and the <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/a/7053/218"">folded dipole</a>.

<p>A <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/a/7061/218"">sleeve balun</a> is another possibility. It uses a quarter-wave stub to insert a high impedance in the common-mode.</p>

<p>There some antenna designs out there that claim no balun is necessary. Sometimes it's true (the balun is intrinsic in the design) and sometimes it's not.

"What sort of radiation efficiency can one expect from a folded dipole?","1155","","<p>It is pretty well established that <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/q/830/29"">folded dipoles have much greater acceptable-SWR bandwidth than ordinary dipoles</a>.</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antenna_efficiency#Definition"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Radiation efficiency</a> is simply the quotient of radiated power to the antenna feedpoint input power.</p>

<p>Seeing that folded dipoles are able to achieve the greater bandwidth <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/q/919/29"">without introducing a designed-as-lossy element</a> (a technique not unheard of with large-bandwidth antennas), <strong>what is the effect on radiation efficiency of using a folded dipole as opposed to a regular dipole?</strong> Are there any considerations affecting folded dipoles that would not affect a regular dipole antenna erected in the same physical location which would have a noticable impact on the radiation efficiency?</p>

<p>For the purpose of this question, assume otherwise identical conditions; identical height over ground, identical ground, identical possible parasitic elements, identical feedline, etc. Also, note that I am not asking about the radiation pattern of the folded dipole; I am <em>only</em> concerned with the antenna's radiation efficiency here, unless some other factor has a noticable impact on the radiation efficiency as compared to a regular dipole.</p>

<p><em>A great answer</em> would look at this from both the perspective of a same-wire-length antenna (meaning approximately double the folded dipole's physical length) as well as a same-physical-space antenna (meaning effectively half the radiator length).</p>
","<p>For all practical purposes, the radiation efficiency of a folded dipole versus an ordinary dipole is the same. Consider, they are essentially the same antenna.</p>

<p>The only difference is that in the folded dipole, we've replaced the feedpoint with a short. Since the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%A9venin%27s_theorem"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Thévenin equivalent resistance</a> of a voltage source is 0Ω, this doesn't make a lick of difference to the currents in the antenna. The currents are the same, the fields are the same. Everything is the same, except that the voltage source now sees only half the current.</p>

<p>So then, what is there that could affect radiation efficiency? There is nothing. There might be some difference in ohmic losses, depending on if you allow the folded dipole to have twice as much copper or not, but this is a very small contributor to loss.</p>

<p>More significant for terrestrial antennas is ground losses in the Earth, but having established that the fields around a dipole and a folded dipole are the same, how could the losses be different? They aren't. The same reasoning applies to any other kind of loss.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Receive antennas are the easiest thing ever. You just need two things:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>something that conducts electricity</li>
  <li>another thing that conducts electricity</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>… Don't worry about tuning, or impedance matching. This also will increase the fraction of the energy received by your antenna coupled to the receiver, but again, once you have enough to overcome the receiver's noise, more is of absolutely no help.</p>
  
  <p>…</p>
  
  <p>If you really must worry about something, worry about getting your antenna away from noise sources. …</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As covered there, most characteristics of the antenna don't matter if you are not transmitting.</p>

<p>However, if you are interested in the VHF/UHF (rather than HF) frequencies which those receivers cover, there are a couple more concerns.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Polarization matters, because it is not randomized by the ionosphere. You will want your antenna to be vertically or horizontally polarized depending on what signals you want to receive. In the amateur radio bands, most VHF/UHF signals are vertically polarized.</p></li>
<li><p>Location matters. At these frequencies signals are much closer to propagating like light — you want a clear path from the transmitter to your antenna, if possible. For strong transmitters like FM broadcast stations and amateur repeaters, this is less of an issue.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally — this is equally applicable to HF but more practical at higher frequencies — if you are seeking to receive weak signals, it is helpful to have a <em>directional</em> antenna pointed at the source. The most common amateur uses for directional antennas at VHF are satellite communications and direction-finding.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So, get a piece of wire of roughly the right length for the band you think you'll be most interested in (again: doesn't matter much), mount it vertically as high in the air as you feel like arranging, hook it up to the center contact of your receiver's antenna port, and there you go. Or if you want to buy something premade, buy a “scanner” antenna, because those are intended for receive-only use and wide bandwidth.</p>

"How does SDR demodulation differ between wideband and narrowband FM?","1138","","<p>What is the difference between software demodulation of an IQ signal between wideband FM and narrowband FM?  Both seem to look at the 2nd difference in unwrapped phase angles of IQ samples.</p>
","<p>There are actually three different distinctions one could mean by referring to “narrowband” FM.</p>

<hr>

<p>Wideband FM in this context generally refers to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM_broadcasting#Modulation_characteristics"" rel=""nofollow"">the type of FM used for broadcast stations</a> — those picked up by consumer FM receivers — as opposed to that used by two-way communications, including amateur transceivers.</p>

<p>You are right that there is no fundamental difference between them in how the <em>frequency modulation</em> is demodulated via DSP. In both, the difference between the instantaneous frequency of the signal from some nominal carrier frequency is proportional to the modulating (audio) signal. The distinction is in the <em>maximum deviation</em>, which is closely related to the occupied bandwidth.</p>

<p>That is, if you modulated either type of FM transmitter with a signal at, say, 50% of maximum input level, the wideband FM signal would have a much larger deviation for the same signal. The advantage of this is that wideband FM has higher fidelity and picks up less noise, because the larger instantaneous frequency changes are less easily affected by noise.</p>

<p>You could in principle demodulate either type of FM with the exact same demodulator with the same settings; however, the wideband FM would come out louder because of the larger deviation. In practice, you also need a <em>filter</em> before the demodulator which removes all the noise or other signals which would interferes with the instantaneous-frequency demodulation; this is what actually makes the biggest difference. To a narrowband receiver, a wideband signal is extremely over-deviating; the frequency repeatedly moves entirely out of the filter passband, so that all but the zero-crossings of the signal are replaced by noise. To a wideband receiver, a narrowband signal is extremely quiet.</p>

<p>An additional difference in practice, not inherently related to the deviation and bandwidth, is that wideband FM signals may include stereo or other additional information. Stereo is actually added <em>to the modulating signal</em> — that is, the FM modulation is unchanged. The “pilot tone” and stereo difference signal are added to the mono audio but shifted to a frequency high enough that they do not conflict with the audio frequencies and a typical mono receiver will not reproduce them. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File%3aRDS_vs_DirectBand_FM-spectrum2.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia has a nice plot of what you might find in a broadcast FM signal</a> — this is an “audio” spectrum, so you will not see these things laid out on a waterfall display.</p>

<hr>

<p>Another “wide vs. narrow” distinction you might hear about: there are two different maximum deviations (5 kHz and 2.5 kHz) that have been used for two-way radios — in the US, the FCC required a shift to the narrower bandwidth to enable using more channels in the same spectrum; this event was called “narrowbanding”. Amateur equipment is under no such requirement and to my knowledge still typically uses the wider (5 kHz) deviation.</p>

<p>In radio software I have seen these distinct modes being cryptically labeled ""NFM1"" vs. ""NFM2"", or ""FM"" vs. ""NFM"", whereas broadcast FM is usually ""WFM"".</p>

<hr>

<p>Finally, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_modulation#Modulation_index"" rel=""nofollow"">in the theory of modulation</a>, FM is called wideband if the maximum deviation significantly exceeds the highest modulating frequency, and narrowband if the highest modulating frequency significantly exceeds the maximum deviation. By “modulating frequency” we mean the frequencies present in the modulating signal (the audio signal). This relationship affects the effective occupied bandwidth of the signal, and therefore the choice of low-pass filter used to select the channel before demodulating it.</p>

"What is generally considered ""too much"" power for JT-65 on HF?","1127","","<p>Recently, I have begun experimenting with JT-65A, mostly on 20 meters. I usually run about 5 watts with that mode, since I know that JT-65 is a weak-signal mode. Is that still too much power? What is generally considered excessive power on JT-65?</p>
","<p>5 watts is probably what most JT-65 purists will tell you to use, but in practice, I tend to aim for 20 watts. That gives you a good 6dB boost (every doubling of power is equal to +3dB) which is actually meaningful in JT-65. Any more than that, and you'll start finding certain problems. Note that the same is true for the WSPR family of protocols.</p>

<p>First, that since everyone else is using less power than you are, you'll have many cases of people hearing you, but you can't hear them.</p>

<p>That in turn means that you run the risk of interfering with a conversation that you can't even see, especially if you're running 100W and they're each at 5 or 20.</p>

<p>Finally, many transceivers will cause distortions in the JT-65 waveform when run at above a quarter to a half of their maximum power. Transceivers are meant to work with analog data, not the sharp frequency transitions of the digital signal. Overdriving them can cause clipping, which will cause you to actually waste power and may even make your transmission unreadable.</p>

<p>So to answer the question, the standard maximum is either 20 or 30 watts - and there's really no point in exceeding that. Many people win awards on the mode at 5 watts! Most transceivers will distort your waveform above a certain limit, and there's no point in risking it for another 2 or 3 dB.</p>

"Adequate lightning protection for sloped dipole or G5RV?","1111","","<p>Has anyone had experience, or knows from first principles, whether installing a G5RV or dipole BELOW a ""lightning-rod"" in such a manner would serve as a means of discouraging direct lightning strikes onto your dipole:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A ""lightning rod"" is some distance above the highest point of the G5RV, and has a ground wire that avoids coming near to the dipole.</p></li>
<li><p>Such that the ""lightning rod"" is connected to a ground wire which goes directly to its own ground-rod which has been attached to its own dedicated ground-spike.</p></li>
<li><p>With some hope that lightning, should it strike above your QTH, would hit the ""rod"" above the G5RV and most of the current would travel down the ground wire.</p></li>
<li><p>The lightning rod is about 5 feet above the dipole, and is supported from below by fiberglass pole.</p></li>
<li><p>There are no other antenna towers or tall metal objects within 100 feet of the above.</p></li>
<li><p>The antenna wire and antenna coax  do not come within 4 feet of the ground wire, the air gap is intended to discourage lightning jumping from the lightning rod to the antenna.  The ground wire is installed with a sloping section to avoid coming near to the G5RV or dipole.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Is the above a reasonable thing? Is it worth doing?  Assume that the G5RV or dipole has a lightning arrestor attached to its coax feed line in the usual manner, and that this ""lightning rod"" is a secondary protective feature.</p>

<p>Here's a sample scenario for the sake of criticism/critique:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sTBE9.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>I suspect this scheme will do little or nothing to decrease the chance of damage to your equipment in the case of a lighting strike.</p>

<p>For the sake of argument, let's just presume that it does work as you expect: lighting always strikes the rod, which has a dedicated conductor to a dedicated ground rod, and all of that is sufficiently isolated from everything else that no arcing occurs. Your situation is something like this:</p>



<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CjjQa.png"" alt=""schematic""></p>



<p><sup><a href=""/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fCjjQa.png"">simulate this circuit</a> &ndash; Schematic created using <a href=""https://www.circuitlab.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">CircuitLab</a></sup></p>

<p>We've made a bunch of assumptions but you still have a problem. Lighting happens when the charge imbalance between Earth and a cloud becomes so great that the voltage difference is enough to ionize the air and establish a conductive channel. Electric charge then travels over this channel to equalize the charge imbalance. That electric charge doesn't just need to get to the ground: it needs to spread out over the whole Earth. If it didn't, then there would be a spot on the ground where the lighting struck that would have a severe excess or lack of charged particles. It's like dumping a huge bucket into a pool: the water spreads out over the entire pool to minimize the gravitational potential of the water.</p>

<p>Now, Earth is anything but a great electrical conductor. That's why we need radials for ground plane antennas if we don't want them to be lossy. The impedance of the Earth between your connections to ground is represented by R2, R3, and R4.</p>

<p>Now, you have many kiloamperes of current flowing through an Earth that is a little bit resistive. Do you see the problem? Do you think most of that electric charge will go through R3, or your radio?</p>

<p>So, one important aspect of effective lighting protection: have exactly <em>one</em> ground. You can have multiple ground rods, but you should tie them together with a low impedance path, but any equipment you want to protect should have exactly <em>one</em> connection to this system of grounds. Remember to consider non-obvious paths through your electrical outlet, feedline, Ethernet cable, etc.</p>

<p>Also, those assumptions we made are probably not good ones. Having a lighting rod up high reduces, but does not eliminate the odds of a strike on things below it, and it's very likely lighting will arc to anything and everything even many feet away from your lighting rod system.</p>

"Has a vehicle magnetic antenna mount ever caused a road accident?","1090","","<p>Some people believe that mag mount magnets lose their effectiveness over time, eventually causing a dangerous situation as the antenna could rip loose from the vehicle and become a projectile or distraction at an unfortunate time -- e.g. on a highway due to air forces or perhaps at a stoplight under heavy braking.  </p>

<p>Mitigating these concerns are the fact that the antenna is still attached by coax and that I personally have never seen it mentioned in the news nor have I heard of any traffic laws prohibiting mag mount antennas on a vehicle.</p>

<p>Still, with safety in mind, I use the screw in trunk lip mounts.  </p>

<p>Should I keep telling my friends to stay away from the mag mounts or are these supposed dangers merely paranoia and urban legend?</p>
","<p><strong>Magnet mounts can come off, and they do fall occasionally.</strong> I can't quote any statistics, but it has happened to me twice in the past - tall HF antenna combined with too small magnet mount and high speed. Luckily the cable held the thing on the roof. Short VHF/UHF sticks (think 1/4 wave for 2 meters) would never fall with the same mount - the wind load is just so much smaller. For my irregular HF use, I've switched to a larger magnet mount and thinner vertical, and the constantly used VHF/UHF sticks are drilled-through.</p>

<p>There are also stories of shattered glass (antenna comes off and hits your own back window) and scratches on roof.</p>

<p>If the antenna fell down and stopped in the middle of a highway, it would be dangerous to a motorcycle, but less of a hazard to a car. It might break a tire, which in turn could lead into a more serious accident. A thick HF antenna could puncture a car somehow. Large magnet mounts are heavy, and one <em>could</em> bounce higher into air and penetrate a wind shield. In an accident it would probably get loose and fly away, but it would have the same velocity as the much heavier car, and the damage caused by the car would probably be dominant.</p>

<p>If you loose one of these on a road, do go back and pick it up immediately. If you loose one on a highway, in many places it's both dangerous and illegal to stop and go pick it up yourself, so you might have to call the police for assistance.</p>

Magnets on the roof are unlikely to get hot enough to degauss (140 °C / 280 °F for neodymium, 300 °C / 570 °F for ferrite and SmCo), and they're not subject to strong external magnetic fields, either. <em>Hammering or jarring</em> - some vibration is going to be present, and after a very long time that might have some effect, but that's just my guess.</p>

<p>Typically a mag mount will be decommissioned quick enough that demagnetizing should not be a concern. Water tends to get into the connectors and cables, and the cables break from stress under doors.</p>

<p><strong>Magnet mounts are very popular.</strong> I don't remember any documented serious accidents with them. If accidents would happen, there would be articles on the amateur magazines, blog posts, and pictures on the Internet. <strong>I would claim they're pretty safe, if the relation between antenna size, mag mount strength and vehicle velocity are in a good balance</strong>.</p>

"Choke at antenna and feedpoint?","1088","","<p>I'm planning on putting up a G5RV. From the ladder line I connect 5m coax to the shack; would it be worth doing a common mode current choke at both the antenna feedpoint and the coax feedpoint? (I read somewhere that it's recommended at the coax.)</p>
","<h2>Avoid common-mode sheath currents</h2>

<p>Common-mode sheath currents on the coaxial feed line should be avoided because:</p>

<ul>
<li>At the antenna feed point or the transition point of balanced line to coax, common-mode currents interfere with your radiation pattern.</li>
<li>In the shack, common-mode sheath currents will interfere with your  electronic equipment (RFI).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Origin of the common mode</h2>

<p>Most often, the common mode on the coaxial feeding cable is a continuation of the standing wave that exists over the length of most antennas. (Aperiodic resistive antennas and leaky-wave antennas are notable exceptions.)</p>

<p>This standing wave, in turn, results from the abrupt change in conductivity $\sigma$ and/or permitivity $\epsilon_{r}$ that is encountered at the antenna ends. This is called <em>the boundary condition</em> in technical literature.</p>

<p>Being a standing wave implies that, for any given frequency, the common mode will show current minima every halve wavelength, starting from the antenna ends. Without a current balun and/or a sheath current choke, these current minima will repeat further down the coaxial feed line.</p>

<h2>Optimal placement of a sheath current choke</h2>

<p>A sheath current choke typically inserts only about 500Ω impedance in series with the sheath of the coaxial cable. This means that sheath current chokes are ineffective at places along the feed line where the common mode wave has a current minimum, because the common mode impedance there will be high (typically about 2kΩ). <strong>Sheath current chokes are most effective at common-mode current maxima.</strong></p>

<h2>Practical considerations</h2>

<ol>
<li>By all means, use a decently made, properly rated (frequency and power) <strong>current balun</strong> at your antenna feed point. This will be a first, <strong>broadband</strong> defence against common-mode sheath currents.</li>
<li><p>Current baluns tend to be less effective at lower frequencies because they produce their common-mode series impedance from inductance. Therefore, common-mode sheath current rejection may not be sufficient at the lower frequency bands. A <strong>sheath current choke</strong> may be placed <strong>at current maxima</strong> of the lowest frequency band, i.e.:</p>

<ul>
<li>At $\frac{\lambda}{4}$ distance measured from the antenna ends, where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the lowest frequency band, and/or</li>
<li>At odd multiples of this length, i.e. $\frac{3\lambda}{4}$, $\frac{5\lambda}{4}$, ...</li>
</ul>

<p>This will normally also handle the common-mode wave rejection for the second lowest frequency band if this is a harmonic of the lowest. </p></li>
<li><p>Sheath current chokes close to the antenna feed point will help to preserve the radiation pattern of the antenna. Sheath current chokes closer to shack may help more against RFI.</p></li>
<li><p>If you can, connect the coax sheath to earth at both ends and place the coaxial cable on or below ground.</p></li>

"What should I consider when choosing a coaxial cable?","1079","","<p>Given a middling-power rig (up to 100 W) requiring a 50 Ω antenna, a few options for the coaxial cable with a 50 Ω impedance are</p>

<ul>
<li>RG-174</li>
<li>RG-58A/U</li>
<li>RG-8</li>
<li>RG-213</li>
</ul>

<p>Apart from cost, what factors are relevant in deciding which coaxial cable to use?</p>
","<p>The most important thing about the cable is how much loss are you willing to accept in the feed line. Figure out how much cable you will need, and then determine what the loss on said cable will be. As I mentioned on <a href=""http://www.kd7uiy.com/2013/03/the-quest-for-cable.html"">my website</a>, here's a few good rules of thumb:</p>

<ul>
<li>Keep the power loss to no more than 3 db in the cable. </li>
<li>If you can, use the same impedance as your antenna/transmitter, but always keep the impedance to within a factor of 1.5 of your antenna/transmitter. But really, match them, it's not worth the hassle of mis-matched cable.</li>
<li>If you can, use only a single strand of cable. Also, use the right connectors for both ends.</li>
<li>Buy for the largest frequency that you think you will be using.</li>
<li>Get a cable that is slightly larger than you need, but not excessively larger.</li>
<li>The velocity factor only matters if you are trying to build a phase changing antenna.</li>
</ul>

<p>Longer cable equals more loss. Higher frequency is also more loss. Here's a few websites that talk about what the loss is per length and frequency of each cable:</p>

"What rig should I start with when trying to get hands-on experience with FLDIGI?","1060","","<p>I would like to get hands-on experience with FLDIGI. What setup is recommendable?</p>
","<p>Nearly any SSB HF rig will do.</p>

<p>You need some way to get audio out of the receiver and into your computer, and out of your computer and into the transmitter. Most modern transceivers provide some kind of connection for this. In a pinch, you can use the headphone and microphone connections.</p>

<p>It's also convenient (through not necessary) if Fldigi can key the radio for you. With some fiddling, you can usually rig up something that uses one of the control lines on a serial port to control a relay or optioisolator to key the radio. Methods vary based on the radio, so just search the internets for a rig you are considering.</p>

<p>Even better is to get a rig which supports control over a serial connection. Fldigi uses <a href=""http://hamlib.sourceforge.net/manuals/1.2.15/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">hamlib</a>, so anything supported by hamlib will work. Usually there's a serial port on the back of the radio, and if you don't have a serial port on your computer a USB cable can be had for $20 or so.</p>

<p>Get the list of supported radios by running <code>rigctl -l</code>. Your version might be different, but I get:</p>

"Is Morse code a requirement for ham licensing?","1058","","<p>As I recall, it used to be in the U.S. that the ability to read and send Morse code over CW was a requirement for an amateur license (and was tested, I believe).  Is that still true in the U.S.?  If not when was it dropped?  Around the world, is Morse a requirement for amateur licensing?</p>
","<p>It is not required any more for any US license, as of 2008. It has not been required for the technician license since 1991. It is still required in some areas, and some international amateur radio licenses, in particular the IARP license, which may be used by US amateurs to operate outside of the US in IARP countries.</p>

<p>Bottom line is, however, that fewer and fewer countries are requiring it, ever since the 2003 ruling from the ITU that no longer required knowledge of CW for operating on HF. </p>

"Can I send samples from the device made by myself to GNU radio?","1054","","<p>I have two high-speed sampling devices that can use UDP (through 1G Ethernet) and PCIe to transmmit their samples, respectively. They are used to record signals I interested. These devices are made by myself so the data format and the software running on OS are easy to be modified. Now I want to use GNU radio to demodulate some signals from the devices in real-time but I don't now the interface and format of GNU Radio. Is it possible to do that? Is it necessary to read or even modify its source code? And which document should I read?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
","<p>Here are several different approaches you can take.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You can write a GNU Radio source block which knows how to interact with your particular device. This does not require modifying GNU Radio's source code: you can compile your block separately, in which case it is known as an <a href=""https://gnuradio.org/redmine/projects/gnuradio/wiki/OutOfTreeModules"" rel=""nofollow""><em>out of tree module</em>; here's a tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>This custom source block would be written in C++ (or Python, though there are some restrictions in that case) and gets a thread of its own in which it can do whatever is necessary to obtain samples from the hardware.</p>

<p>The advantage of this method is that you can write methods on the source to control the device and handle special events using stream tags and message ports. The disadvantage is that you're writing more custom code, including the application that uses your block.</p></li>
<li><p>You can use one of the existing general-purpose source blocks.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The <a href=""http://gnuradio.org/doc/doxygen/classgr_1_1blocks_1_1udp__source.html#details"" rel=""nofollow"">UDP source block</a> simply takes the content of UDP datagrams and puts them into the GR flow graph. You can use this immediately with your UDP-based device if it has no high-level protocol carried within the datagrams.</p></li>
<li><p>You could also have your application open a connection to the device in whatever way, before the flow graph is started, and then use the <a href=""http://gnuradio.org/doc/doxygen/classgr_1_1blocks_1_1file__descriptor__source.html"" rel=""nofollow"">file descriptor source</a>; this works if you have some way to open your device as a file (<code>/dev/something</code> or a pipe from another process/thread doing the reading). If you use stdin (file descriptor 0) then you don't need extra code inside the process, so you can use GNU Radio Companion, and set up a pipe like <code>./my-device-reader | ./my-grc-flowgraph.py</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>If your PCIe device can be made to look like a standard audio device, then you could use the audio source block.

<p>The advantage of this method is that you don't have to write as much code, and you might find the generic interfaces useful (e.g. piping your samples into something that's <em>not</em> written in GNU Radio instead). The disadvantage is that you can't control the device or use any particular features beyond the stream of samples, because the generic source block doesn't know about the features of your device.</p></li>

<li><p>Since you say you can change the hardware's protocols, you can also simply change them to use the same protocol as an existing radio peripheral.

"Why is dynamic range relevant for an SDR?","1047","","<p>Sometimes I see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">dynamic range</a> mentioned as a figure of merit for an SDR. For example, I know that the <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/q/607/218"">bits per sample</a> used by the analog to digital converter can affect the dynamic range.</p>

<p>Why do I care about dynamic range? What happens when I don't have enough of it? Can I have too much of it? Does dynamic range have special significance or importance for an SDR compared to a traditional analog receiver?</p>
","<h3>Signal strength and dynamic range</h3>

<p>Generally speaking, dynamic range is the ratio between the strongest and weakest signal that can be received. In a digital signal, the dynamic range is determined by the number of bits per sample: the strongest signal is one which uses the full range of the sample values, and the weakest signal is one which uses only two adjacent values (one bit change).</p>

<p>In a software-defined radio, the <em>analog</em> signal level fed into the analog-to-digital converter must be adjusted (either manually or by an AGC) to make best use of the available dynamic range:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If the analog signal is too strong, then the logically corresponding digital values are not representable in the numeric range of the samples, and the ADC will substitute the maximum or minimum possible output; this is known as <strong>clipping</strong>, which from a signal processing perspective is an extreme form of nonlinearity.</p>

<p>If you have clipping, it can be observed as the appearance of spurious signals which are copies of actual signals in the received band at different frequencies.</p></li>
<li><p>If the analog signal is too weak, then its presence will not manage to make even one bit of difference in the digital output. More practically, well before the one-bit point you will be losing information due to the digital sample values being too coarse-grained to accurately represent the signal. This can be thought of as a source of noise, called <strong>quantization noise</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yc4Xn.png"" alt=""""></p>

<p>The above image shows a sampled (50 samples) and quantized (5 bits) sine wave with different amplitudes, showing each of the above effects. Note in particular how even the relatively nice-looking sine on the left has slightly irregular points (because the sine function's real-number values get rounded to the closest representable value): this is an example of quantization noise.</p>

<h3>Why dynamic range matters for SDRs</h3>

<p>Given the above, it might sound like you can have an AGC that keeps the input signal at just the right level, and not need very much dynamic range.</p>

<p>This would be true, except that in a software-defined radio of the kind we're interested in, <strong>the signal into the ADC is much wider bandwidth than the individual signals we want to demodulate!</strong> This additional bandwidth is what allows you to get the “waterfall” or “panadapter” display characteristic of SDRs (because you're actually digitizing a wide band of RF), but it means that the analog signal coming into our ADC contains lots of RF power which is not any one signal we want to demodulate — it includes a large amount of noise, and possibly many intentional signals, some of which may be very strong compared to the desired signal.</p>

<p>The best analog gain setting is determined by the <em>total RF power</em> coming into the ADC (from the tuner and analog filter, if present). This fixes the “strong” end of the scale of possible digital signal levels, leaving the “weak” end determined by dynamic range. Therefore, the more dynamic range we have, the less quantization noise is present in narrow-band signals (which are more or less weak compared to the overall signal), allowing them to be received more clearly.</p>

<p>You can also improve reception with the same dynamic range by using a narrower analog filter, thus reducing the input power and allowing more gain to be applied to it without clipping — if your SDR hardware has a usefully adjustable filter.</p>

<p>The extreme case of using a narrower filter is using one just as wide as a single signal you want to receive. The disadvantage is you don't have any spectrum view while you're doing that — you can only receive that one signal.</p>

<h3>Direct answers</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why do I care about dynamic range? What happens when I don't have enough of it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Signals you want to receive disappear into the (quantization) noise floor.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can I have too much of it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a user of a SDR, no, except as it affects the price tag. As a designer, additional sample bits:</p>

<ul>
<li>require additional computation (significant for embedded systems; probably moot if you're using a general-purpose machine for your DSP since the samples will likely be expanded into 32-bit integers or floats for computation),</li>
<li>require a higher-performance (expensive) ADC, and</li>
<li>may be worthless due to noise received by the antenna (if the electromagnetic noise floor is higher than the quantization noise floor when the gain is set optimally) or noise getting into the system between the gain-control stage and the ADC (the low bits are always noise).</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Does dynamic range have special significance or importance for an SDR compared to a traditional analog receiver?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Strictly speaking, no — it is not being software-defined that makes dynamic range matter, but the wide bandwidth. However, if by SDR you mean something with a waterfall display, then yes, it does (as described above).</p>

","<p>An elevated ""ground-plane"" antenna with tuned radials has, by itself, a pattern much like a dipole doughnut shape (freespace is what I'm talking about at the moment).  Unfortunately we must mount the antenna and feed it with a feedline.  This introduces one or more additional conductors below the radials that demonstrably (via simulation and measurement) draw/induce some power from the radials and flow energy below the antenna.  See figure 5 <a href=""http://www.hamradio.me/antennas/j-pole-antenna-grounding-have-your-j-pole-and-ground-it-too.html"" rel=""nofollow"">of this article</a>.  This seems to cause the slight uptilt you most often see in ground-plane antenna documentation.  The 3 dB beamwidth in the vertical E-plane is still quite enormous with energy both above and below the level of the antenna.</p>

<p>Some purists do mount these things upside down on a tower side bracket when the antenna site is much much higher than the surrounding users of the radio system. Indeed ""beam downtilt"" in collinear phased array systems is a serious attribute to study for some radio system circumstances... especially for the shorter wavelengths.  Trigonometry helps answer when to consider this approach as I cover <a href=""http://www.hamradio.me/antennas/repeaters-antennas-trigonometry.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

"How does selecting the opposite sideband when receiving CW on HF reduce interference?","1036","","<p>I am studying for my FCC General Class license, and question/answer <code>G4A02</code> reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Q:</strong> What is one advantage of selecting the opposite or ""reverse"" sideband when receiving CW signals on a typical HF transceiver?</p>
  
  <p><strong>A:</strong> It may be possible to reduce or eliminate interference from other signals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am studying from the <em>ARRL General Class License Manual (Seventh Edition)</em>.</p>

<p>I don't understand how this is possible. If the signal is being transmitted on the upper sideband, how does switching to receive on the lower sideband eliminate interference? As I understand it, that would eliminate everything from the upper sideband, and I would hear nothing from the upper sideband <em>including</em> the CW signal I'm trying to listen for.</p>

<p>The referenced page from the Q/A explains this concept thusly: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...<br>
  <em>Reverse Sideband</em> controls allow the operator to switch between receiving CW signals above the displayed carrier frequency (USB) and below it (LSB). This can help avoid nearby signals causing interference by placing them on the other side of the carrier frequency where filtering rejects them.<br>
  ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do not understand. <strong>How does this work?</strong></p>
","<p>CW signals are not “transmitted on the upper sideband”, nor the lower one. A CW signal is approximately <em>at a single frequency</em> (with only the additional bandwidth required to allow the key-up and key-down transitions).</p>

<p>However, the standard method of <em>receiving</em> a CW signal is identical in structure to a single-sideband receiver. The local oscillator (LO) of the receiver is set to a frequency <em>not quite equal</em> to the CW signal, and the difference between the incoming CW and the LO is the audio tone you hear. Let's say for concreteness that the difference is 800 Hz.</p>

<p>If that frequency shifting were all that was going on, then you would hear many CW signals (from both sidebands) at different pitches, so there is a very narrow filter to select just the one signal. That filter will select either the frequency +800 Hz from the LO (upper sideband) or the one &minus;800 Hz from the LO (lower sideband).</p>

<p>For convenience, a modern transceiver does not display the LO frequency (as it does in single-sideband mode) but rather the LO frequency offset by 800 Hz, so that you know the actual frequency of the signal.</p>

<p>If you switch from upper-sideband reception to lower-sideband reception, then you (or your receiver's CPU, more likely) should simultaneously change the LO frequency to be 1600 Hz (double the offset) higher, so that (if you were perfectly tuned to start with) you'll hear the same signal at the same pitch as before.</p>

<p>The difference this makes is that signals <em>not</em> exactly at the 800 Hz offset frequency will be flipped around that midpoint: an unwanted signal within the filter passband that was at (relative) 1200 Hz will now be at 400 Hz, and you might find that lower-pitched sound less troublesome. Or, if your receiver's filters are not perfectly symmetrical for this purpose, the unwanted signal could be actually attenuated.</p>

<hr>

<p>If you have a receiver already, listen to CW and SSB signals using both CW and SSB modes, tune around, and try to get a feel for what's going on. CW mode is just SSB mode with a narrower filter and the offset display.</p>

<p>(Note that when you switch between CW and SSB mode, your receiver might preserve the actual LO frequency (thus changing the displayed frequency), or preserve the displayed frequency (thus changing the LO frequency and the pitch of what you hear).</p>

"Why do repeaters use cavity filters?","1033","","<p>Repeaters apparently often use large, expensive cavity filters to connect the receiver and transmitter to the same antenna.</p>

<p>Why aren't typical electrical circuits, such as inductors and capacitors used instead?  Wouldn't they be cheaper and smaller?</p>
","<p>A cavity filter is inductors and capacitors. Something like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3waMG.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here"">
(from <a href=""http://www.amateur-radio-wiki.net/index.php?title=What_is_a_cavity_filter%3F"" rel=""noreferrer"">amateur-radio-wiki.net</a>)</p>

<p>There are several reasons these are not constructed from more common discrete inductors and capacitors. Firstly, these filters must handle a bit of power. Not that you can't get high-power discrete capacitors and inductors, but they aren't cheap, or small.</p>

<p>But perhaps more importantly, the cavity filter is a notch filter. Since we want to pass some frequencies while deeply attenuating some other frequencies that are not very far apart, we need a deep, narrow, steep notch. The notchiness comes from the resonance of the capacitors and inductors, and with ideal components, at resonance, the stopband attenuation is infinite.</p>

<p>Sadly, we can't have ideal components. Any real inductor or capacitor will have some resistance and other non-ideal behaviors (self-resonance, etc) which serve to dampen the resonance of the filter. As this resonance is dampened, you get less of a notch, and more of a shallow trough. Too much damping and now the notch isn't deep or steep enough to accomplish the objective.</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_factor#Electrical_systems"" rel=""noreferrer"">Q factor</a> is one way to quantify the damping in an RLC circuit such as this. The cavity filter is a way of constructing an RLC circuit with a very low R, and thus, very high Q.</p>

<p>A good cavity filter will also account for other practical considerations. Its tuning must be stable over temperature changes. It shouldn't leak a lot of RF, since it's probably collocated with other RF equipment. It should be able to handle high power without damage. It should be durable, since it's probably at a difficult to access location. It should come from the factory tested, and perhaps already tuned to the desired frequency. All these things add to the cost.</p>

"Ideal antenna type for FM 2 meters?","1030","","<p>Clearly, building a Yagi tuned for 2 meters will likely have the best <em>directional</em> performance.  Putting that aside, I'm trying to get information on what antenna type will have the best overall performance in the 2 meter band in an NFM mode.</p>

<p>I have a 5/25 watt 2 meter FM transceiver that I'm currently using.  I've been experimenting with a ground plane antenna that I built with 4 radials.  Just using it here in the office (rather than up high and outside) reception seems ""ok"".  SWR is currently 3:1, but I'm not using it for TX at the moment.  I'm also hesitant to try to tune it since I'm not sure if the ground plane radials are too long... or too short. :)  I'm afraid that I could make things worse by trimming them.</p>

<p>I'm on a bit of a budget, so I'm currently building gear.  In your experience (or if you can back it up with some theory), which type of antenna would provide the best overall (non-directional) performance?  Building a dipole is definitely within my capabilities.  I'm sure I can handle a j-pole too... but I'd rather not end up in an endless cycle of antenna building. :)  I'd rather build the thing just once!</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Just for clarification, ""working ok"" means that I'm reading a signal off of a repeater that's 43 miles away in Hartford, CT with the antenna sitting on the floor of my office.  Perhaps I just need to scale up, tune it and get it up above my roof.</p>
","<p>Fundamental questions in a choice of antenna design are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Does it have the proper polarization (vertical, horizontal, or circular)?</li>
<li>Does it have the proper radiation pattern?</li>
</ul>

<p>Some secondary issues are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Will the antenna be small enough for the space available, at the desired frequency?</li>
<li>How will it be mechanically supported, without interfering with the electrical properties?</li>
<li>Will nearby objects interfere with it, or assist it (e.g. car roof as ground plane)?</li>
<li>What type of matching network will it require?</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>mode</strong> does not matter at all. The <strong>frequency</strong> only matters as it affects the size and therefore what is feasible.</p>

<p>You've said you want to do 2 meter FM, and that means that you will want <strong>vertical polarization</strong>. (This mainly means you don't want to build a horizontal dipole, which is a shame because it's really simple. Vertical dipoles work fine, but you need a horizontal structure to keep the feed line running away perpendicularly, which is why it's rarely done.)</p>

<p>This leaves you with a wide variety of vertical antenna designs — ground plane (with radials, or mounted on a metal roof), J-pole, bazooka dipole, coaxial collinear, et cetera. These can all work; it's largely a matter of what you want to build.</p>

<p>However, one factor we haven't yet addressed is the radiation pattern. You said “non-directional”, but there's no such thing as a truly omnidirectional (<em>isotropic</em>) antenna. Any so-called omnidirectional vertical antenna will in fact have a null pointing directly upward. In between directly up and horizontal, the pattern depends on the antenna design, as well as how high above the earth it is. What you want depends on the environment you're in and how stably actually-vertical your antenna is: if you have it mounted in a fixed location <em>with an unobstructed horizontal view</em> then you can benefit from using a higher-gain antenna (more horizontal, less vertical pattern).</p>

<p>Overall: Don't worry about it too much. Given that you're <em>building</em> your antenna, it's likely much more important to pick a design that you can build accurately and tune easily (because small variations in length can matter a lot for VHF).</p>

","<p>To transmit two signals at once, just generate the two signals with the appropriate frequency spacing between them, and add them together.</p>

(You don't have to use the exact midpoint, but doing so allows you to use the lowest sample rate and filter bandwidth.)</p>

<p>Specifically to transmit two unmodulated sine waves, in GRC:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create two Signal Source blocks, complex sine, with their carrier frequencies set to <code>-0.5e6</code> and <code>0.5e6</code>.</li>
<li>Connect them to two inputs of an Add block.</li>
<li>Connect the output of the Add block to your (USRP) sink block with center frequency <code>915.5e6</code>.</li>

<p>Unfortunately, there's no block that is actually convenient for this purpose; the easiest is the ""Frequency Xlating FIR Filter"", which does decimation as well as shifting. Just enter <code>1</code> for the decimation, <code>[1]</code> for the filter taps, and it'll do the job.</p>

<p>The “Rotator” block does pure frequency shifting, but it needs the shift specified as a complex vector (amount of rotation per sample) so it's not convenient to use.</p>

<li>$\omega$ is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_frequency"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">angular frequency</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>If we assume a good conductor and dielectric, then $R$ and $G$ are negligible<sup>1</sup>. The equation then simplifies to:</p>

<p>$$ Z_0 \approx \sqrt{\frac{L}{C}} $$</p>

<p>For <em>round</em> coaxial transmission lines, we can calculate $C$ and $L$ as:</p>

<p>$$ C = {2 \pi \epsilon_0 \epsilon_r \over \ln(D/d)} $$</p>

<p>$$ L = {\mu_0 \mu_r \over 2 \pi} \ln(D/d) $$</p>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
<li>$d$ is the diameter of the inner conductor,</li>
<li>$D$ is the inside diameter of the outer conductor,</li>
<li>$\epsilon_0$ is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_permittivity"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">permittivity of free space</a>, approximately $8.854 \cdot 10^{−12} F \cdot m^{-1}$</li>
<li>$\mu_0$ is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_permeability"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">permeability of free space</a>, approximately $1.256 \cdot 10^{-6} H \cdot m^{-1}$</li>

<li>$\mu_r$ is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permeability_%28electromagnetism%29#Relative_permeability_and_magnetic_susceptibility"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">relative permeability</a> of the dielectric.</li>
</ul>

<p>Putting these together and simplifying we get:</p>

<p>$$ \begin{align} Z_0 
&amp;\approx \sqrt{\frac
  {{\mu_0 \mu_r \over 2 \pi} \ln(D/d)}
  {{2 \pi \epsilon_0 \epsilon_r \over \ln(D/d)}}

  {\mu_r}
  {\epsilon_r}
} \sqrt{\frac
  {\mu_0}
  {(2 \pi)^2 \epsilon_0}
} \ln(D/d) \\
&amp;\approx \sqrt{\frac
  {\mu_r}
  {\epsilon_r}
} 59.96 \ln(D/d) \\
\end{align} $$</p>

<p>For an air dielectric, $\epsilon_r$ and $\mu_r$ are so close to 1 than you can further simplify:</p>

<p>$$ Z_0 \approx 59.96 \ln(D/d) $$</p>

<p>You can also see that only the <em>ratio</em> of the diameters of the conductors are relevant, so it doesn't matter what units of length are used, as long as they are the same.</p>

<p>We can solve for $D/d$, and set $Z_0 = 50 \Omega$:</p>

<p>$$ \begin{align}
56.40 \ln(D/d) &amp;\approx Z_0 \\
\ln(D/d) &amp;\approx \frac{Z_0}{59.96} \\
D/d &amp;\approx e^{Z_0/59.96} \\
D/d &amp;\approx e^{50/59.96} \\
D/d &amp;\approx 2.302

<h3>Explanation, for Square Shield with a Round Center Conductor</h3>

<p>This is a rather less common situation. Kevin Schmidt, W9CF has a <a href=""http://fermi.la.asu.edu/w9cf/articles/square/square.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">full explanation</a>. The equations are rather more complex, owing to the more complex geometry of the conductors, and are most easily solved by computer. However, a good approximation for impedances around 50Ω, with an air dielectric, is:</p>

<p>$$ Z_0 \approx 59.96 \ln(1.079 D/d) $$</p>

<p>or solved for $D/d$:</p>

<p>$$ D/d \approx {e^{Z_0/59.96} \over 1.079} $$</p>

<p>Where:</p>

<ul>
<li>$d$ is the diameter of the inner conductor, and</li>
<li>$D$ is the inside length of one side of the shield.</li>

"Ok to use any repeater?","993","","<p>There's a number of repeaters in my area, each belonging to a particular amateur radio club. These guys are all friendly and willing to chat but I was wondering if it was bad form to make use of a repeater belonging to a club you aren't part of without first getting permission?</p>

<hr>

<p>The repeaters in my are are all listed on the websites for each club but no operating conditions are mentioned, I'll ask but was thinking there might be a general rule.</p>
","<p><strong>Do you have to get permission?</strong> No. Few have issues with guests on a repeater (think of travelers passing through, for instance). In the U.S. they can legally prevent someone from using their repeater (<a href=""http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=55730c6a1b98dd8340e658099cba6f1b&amp;node=47:5.0.1.1.6.3.157.3&amp;rgn=div8"" rel=""nofollow"">see ECFR Title 47, §97.205(e)</a>), but this is not the case in many other countries (repeaters are generally open for all to use).</p>

<p><strong>Should I frequently use a repeater that I don't financially support?</strong> This is an ethical question, so subjectivity abounds. However, it should be kept in mind that repeaters aren't free nor cheap to set up and maintain. Consider paying membership dues or making a donation to the club(s) that maintain a repeater that you use frequently. This will help offset the operating costs and you'll gain some new friends.</p>

<p><strong>What operating conditions should I follow?</strong> There is of course general repeater etiquette (listen first, wait for the courtesy tone, don't kerchunk, use plain language, don't call CQ, etc.), but some clubs may have specific etiquette or pet peeves that you will only find out about in their newsletter (or by attending their meetings). It is generally a good idea to remain somewhat connected to the club that is the control operator of the repeater <em>if you use it frequently</em>. You may also be able to help the other repeater users by learning about a local jammer or other problem as well.</p>

","<p>You have the right general idea, but a couple of problems:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The sample rate entering the DSD block (hence the output of the FM demodulator) <em>must</em> be 48000 Hz; this is hard-coded in gr-dsd.</strong> From your screenshot, you have 35k where you need 48k.</li>
<li>The deemphasis (a.k.a. tau) of the FM demodulator should be set to None, rather than the default of 75.</li>
</ul>

<p>In my experience gr-dsd will work for D-STAR. As a development strategy, first build an analog narrow FM receiver, test it on analog radio (e.g. on amateur FM or weather radio) to make sure the filters and rates are correct (you can hear the output, and there is no over/underrun), then add the DSD block to the chain.</p>

<p>Also note that it is possible for there to be a digital signal present but no audio to decode. Silence doesn't mean it isn't working; gr-dsd will print text whenever it successfully decodes packets.</p>

"Shaving Quartz Crystal for New Frequency","978","","<p>Back in the 1960s during my Novice days I operated on the 40-meter band only with 4 different quartz crystals that determined my transmitting frequency with my Eico 720 CW transmitter.

<p>Has anyone done this and if so do you know how it was done.  Did they change the dimensions merely by sanding or something or did they actually cut the crystal.

  <p>Greetings fellow boatanchorites!</p>
  
  <p>I need help from all the BA gurus out there practiced in the
  mysterious art of grinding FT-243 type surplus crystals to operate in
  the ham bands.</p>
  
  <p>I have had some success bringing crystals down in the 6.8 to 6.9 MHz
  range up into the 40 meter band using dry ""ultra fine"" grade
  sandpaper.  Some have resulted in fine CW tones, others seem to be
  chirpy and have rather lousy short term stability as the transmitter
  is keyed ( &lt;1/2 second of instability).  I realize this instability is
  a characteristic sound of the era, but some of these crystals seem to
  be overly unstable and are just about unusable for CW work.</p>
  
  <p>So, I'd like to call on the collective experience of all you OTs out
  there, to help pass on this magical, little understood, and quite
  possibly lost art of grinding surplus FT-243 type crystals into the
  ham bands.  What were all the tricks of the trade back then?  Are
  there any new fangled products on the market that would make this task
  easier or more accurate?</p>
  
  <p>I also have some general questions on the subject:   Is there a limit
  in how far you can change the frequency of a crystal?   Seems my
  attempts at bringing crystals up from 6.7 MHz and below up into   the
  7.0 MHz range have all resulted in very chirpy output signals.</p>
  
  <p>I've heard that you can alter the frequency slightly up or down by<br>
  changing the spring tension inside the crystal.  If so, does more
  tension   lower or increase the frequency?</p>
  
  <p>What's the best trick to keep from overshooting your desired
  frequency?</p>
  
  <p>Also, is there a frequency or section in the 40 meter band that is the
  hang out for Vintage/Classic gear?</p>
  
  <p>Incase you're curious, I'm using these crystals in Johnson Viking
  Valiant, WRL Globe Chief 90A and Allied Knight T60 transmitters.</p>
  
  <p>Thanks in advance for any and all help! 73 from a young pup trying to
  get the old dogs to teach me some new tricks.</p>

  <p>Try tooth paste or better yet tooth powder in a heavy water slurry
  on a glass plate.  Using light pressure from the second finger (the
  one that is used for signaling) and a circular motion, grind each of
  the straight outer edges lightly.  Then clean off and dry.  If you
  overshoot, a small amount of pencil lead rubbed on the center of the
  crystal face will either lower the frequency or cause it to fail to
  oscillate.</p>
  
  <p>This takes a light touch and a bit of practice.  Avoid grinding the
  center of the crystal face.</p>

  <p>Based on what I've read, any grade of sandpaper is too
  rough--scouring power for big jumps, toothpaste for small ones &amp; final
  grinding on the larger changes.  You can also get grinding paste in
  various grades at hardware stores, though most of what I see is in a
  waxy base for buffing-wheel work.    You've got to keep both of the
  large surfaces parallel and flat!  Work on a slab of plate glass (try
  junk shops, glass stores, and/or any telescope hobbyists you
  know--don't take a used lens grinding glass, though, it's not flat any
  more), and for small rocks, consider grinding a bit of thick brass
  flat and using it to push on the crystal with.  If it goes inactive,
  grind gently at the corners.    Cleanliness is <em>vital.</em> before putting
  it back in the holder, wash your hands, rinse the crystal; set it down
  on a <em>clean</em> and soft surface, wash your hands again, put on gloves
  and clean it with something that'll zap any oil, like 1,1,1
  trichlorethane (""Carbo-clor"") or possibly <em>denatured</em> alchol.  (With
  older rocks, ""cleaning the crystal"" was a regular thing). Wash your
  hands before you start, too, and don't touch your face or hair while
  thinking what to do.  (A dab of denatuared or trichlor will de-oil
  your hands, though it doesn't do the skin any good [yessiree, that's
  why I'm a hand model now, ha!] and may be hazardous--EPA and kin
  aren't very keen about trichlor). B</p>

  <p>More tension, higher freq--within limits!  Saw mention of this and
  other tricks, like adding a shunt trimmer condenser, in an old CQ just
  the other day.  (Naturally I can't find it now).  The article mostly
  concerned making 'em tweakable--the best trick was an FT-243 version
  of the old vari-gap ""rubber crystals,"" for which purpose it was
  suggested the best type of tension spring was made of a retangular
  plate with a half-circle bend in the center and the long sides bent
  flat with a 1/8"" radius half-circle cut-out in the center of the long
  sides (end view like an omega, looking at the short sides; top view, a
  sort of fat H, wider than it is tall).  Drill and tap the cover plate
  in the center, run a screw into the tapped hole, and you have a
  tweakable xtal.  Tweak too far and it may break; that's at your risk
  and no liability on the part of the writer is implied or assumed.
  Offer void where prohibited. :)</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>What's the best trick to keep from overshooting your desired frequency?</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>Go slow, check often.  Most GDOs will work for xtal checking--tune
  it in on your receiver to check freq.  If you run up the meter
  sensitivity, a good crystal will give a <em>lot</em> of deflection.  A
  five-prong or octal tube socket and some plugs that'll fit the coil
  jacks on the GDO make a nice test fixture. (A five-prong socket can be
  wired to fit both ""doorknob"" and FT-243 rocks, a trick I saw for the
  first time last week and am now finding in a lot of places--tie pins 3
  &amp; 4 together, and use pin two for the other connection).    If you
  like fiddlin' measurements, buy a cheap micrometer; measure the
  thickness, check freq; grind a bit and check &amp; measure again.  By the
  third iteration, you'll be able to plot a fair curve correlating
  thickness and freq, which will hold pretty close for other crystals of
  the same type and range.  Still need to fire it up and <em>see</em> in the
  last stages, especially if you're trying to hit a specific freq. 
  (There are ways to fake up a micrometer, with a well-calibrated dial
  and fine-theaded hardware, a Depression-era trick; using a real mike
  is probably just as cheap nowadays).</p>
  
  <p>Hope that's of some use.    73,    --Bobbi</p>

  <p>Back in 1969 I was interested in making a xtal filter for 455 Kc
  (oh,oh, I mean 455 Khz) and an old timer showed me how to ""edge grind""
  old military xtals.  The ones I used had a lead fused to the each side
  of the thin material.  It worked great...in fact an other old timer
  gave me about 100 of the xtals...I think they worked in the SCR-522
  sets but there fundamental freq. was 400-500 Kc range...to build him a
  I.F. filter...</p>
  
  <p>On the presure type (FT453 I think) xtals, the secret is to take your
  time...use 100, 200, 300, and 400 grit NON EMBEDDING grinding compound
  (Clover brand).  The only place I have ever seen it for sale is
  machine tool and gun smith supplies.  Do not use valve grinding
  compound as it is an imbedding type!!  You take it down fast with 100
  then go to 200 and finish polish with 300 and 400.  You use a flat
  plate glass piece to grind on.  Once you are finished you let the xtal
  soak in for about a week in old developing solution that has been used
  a lot...this silver plates it.  Take the xtal out of solution with
  cotton gloves so as not toget grease or rub off the coating.  Take a
  clean piece of plate glass and put white tooth paste on the glass and
  rub the coating off the edges.  There is also a trick for measuring
  activity and frequency with a sig gen, vtvm and a freq meter...but I
  can't remember off hand...good luck!!!

  Grinding</p>
  
  <p>In re: Crystal Grinding... Bobbi's summary looked pretty good, from
  what I remember reading. I remember also seeing something about using
  Hydroflouric Acid as an etchant, but would discourage anyone from
  pursuing this option unless they are a trained chemist operating in a
  proper lab with proper garb.  HF is absorbed through the skin and goes
  to the bone.  All reports indicate that this is extremely painful.</p>
  
  <p>I looked into crystals at one point from a professional perspective;
  checked into the books and talked with some colleagues who make the
  world's lowest phase noise SAW devices.  Suffice to say that
  cleanliness, proper processing, and good materials are all necessary
  to go for ""world class.""  For well made crystals, the differences in
  performance between nitrogen atmosphere, ambient atmosphere, vacuum,
  in a cold weld or resistance weld or a glass package are all very
  noticeable. The presence of a gas will dampen the vibrations,
  decreasing the Q. Contaminents will settle on a crystal, lowering the
  frequency and the Q; this can be part of the aging characteristics or
  a deliberate tuning strategy. Pencil lead, anyone? How about water
  vapor from the atmosphere, and dust in the package?</p>
  
  <p>You can guess where WWII crystals end up in the general scheme of
  things, as well as crystals for microprocessors, etc that are cranked
  out by the million. We are fortunate that we do not require world
  class for amateur application!</p>
  
  <p>One book had a calculation of the acceleration that an atom on the
  surface of the crystal suffers... I seem to remember ~1,000,000 G.
  Deflections were on the order of an atomic diameter, if the memory
  hasn't completed faded this morning.  I would certainly expect the
  lead to move around over the long term, thus changing the frequency
  slightly.</p>
  
  <p>I hope this background gives a little insight into why tuning with a
  pencil can sometimes cause problems, both long and short term, as well
  as why some of the old style crystals might require periodic cleaning
  as Bobbi mentioned.</p>
  
  <p>A common cleaning process in many semiconductor fabs (for grease
  removal) is (was? EPA?) some kind of Trichloro for grease removal,
  followed by methanol for Trico removal, followed by de-ionized water
  for methanol residue removal.  The DI water is then baked off. I used
  something similar to this while preparing samples (electronic, not
  insectile) for a scanning electron microscope. (There! I got mention
  of a hollow state device into this post, so it's partially
  legitimized!)</p>
  
  <p>You may want to consider distilled water from the supermarket for the
  final clean up of your crystal.  I know that I would not use the water
  from my faucet to clean it; it's loaded with iron!</p>
  
  <p>BTW, you may want to check your can of Tuner Cleaner/Degreaser
  ingredients; my can will double for the Trichloro and alcohol steps

  <p>Occurs to me it's might not be clear <em>why</em> this is so--you see, if
  we want our xtal to be a good one, both sides need to be <em>parallel</em>
  (if not, you can end up with a dead'un--or worse) and remain at the
  original angle to the crystalline structure of the quartz.  In
  particular, the AT-cut is a bit fussy; you can think of this common
  cut as a way to combine the frequency vs. temperature characteristics
  of the ol' X and Y-cut rocks, which are opposite in sign but of
  differing slopes.  [Real Engineering and Science types among us will
  know I'm glossing over a lot in that assertion, but it covers the

  if you plan to do a lot of crystals.  (At what they're getting for 'em

  some things having to do with surface smoothness that come into play,
  and saving at least one of the original surfaces helps keep the rock
  active--might be wise to put the side you've been grinding against the
  plate that's got a spring right back of it; last time I opened up a
  junk FT-243-type holder, there was only a spring on one side.  (Dunno

  <p>I've ground quite a few xtals for my use in the Antique Wireless
  Association's annual CW QSO contests (Rig is 1939 vintage reproduction
  6L6-809). A couple of my comments on the subject:</p>
  
  <p>For a given type of ""cut"" (direction of XTAL lattice molecular
  alignment), the fundamental frequency is inversely proportional to the
  thickness. Most FT-243 xtals are ""AT"" cut. The formula is listed in
  many early (1930's) ARRL handbooks. Using this formula, and a good
  micrometer, you can make some rough cuts without having to assemble
  the crystal every time.</p>
  
  <p>Keep your eye out for old xtal grinding kits at hamfests. I have some
  with different ""grits"" of grinding powder. Not sure what it is, but
  looks &amp; feels about like talcum powder, except gray in color.</p>
  
  <p>If the xtal is not ground with both sides parrallel, you may end up
  with two or more different ""fundamental"" frequencies! Not good.</p>
  
  <p>Sometimes an otherwise good xtal that worked fine, but won't oscillate
  or does so erratically after the last grind that moved it only 5 kc or
  so, can be made to work correctly by slightly ""beveling"" all four
  edges on both sides (8 edges total). This procedure is documented in
  many books of the 30's. It usually doesn't need to be a visible bevel,
  just a few ""strokes"" with the compound.</p>
  
  <p>I have best luck with a figure 8 motion for grinding. Some grinding
  kits have a flat piece with a pentagon shaped, shallow cut-out, with
  inwardly curved edges, which will make the quartz piece move around in
  an impressive ""Spiro-graph"" type motion, but I haven't had much luck
  with this item.</p>

  </blockquote>
  
  <p>Here are some short notes on your questions:</p>
  
  <p>-use wet finest possible wet-dry emery paper, or fine carborundum or even toothpaste on a piece of glass.</p>
  
  <p>-activity goes up and down as you grind the frequency upwards.  You may have just gotten to a poor spot on most of your crystals because
  of the distance you moved the frequency.</p>
  
  <p>-activity at/near a frequency depends on thickness/width ratio  so activity can sometimes be restored by grinding the edge(s) of the
  crystal.  Frequency will likely got up as you grind the edge.  Do a
  LITTLE at at time.</p>
  
  <p>-a crystal in a holder with some dust will act strange, if it oscillates at all, so be CLEAN when assembling.  Handy things to have
  are: acetone or alchohol, clean - the kind you might get at the paint
  store may not be too clean (and ventilation!), little soft brush from
  the art store, blower like a bulb-type solder sucker or baby nose
  syringe ...</p>
  
  <p>-increasing spring pressure in the holder will usually increase frequency, I think.  beware of cracking the thing.</p>
  
  <p>-a bit of pencil lead or solder rubbed on the flat surface will lower the frequency by making it heavier, and doing this may help you
  predict what will happen if you grind the edges.</p>
  
  <p>-capacitance of the oscillator circuit may affect the activity of a crytal you've ground.</p>
  
  <p>I'm intersted in making up a ""standard"" oscillator circuit - I have a
  handbook giving lots of tube circuits.  I'd be glad to cooperate on

"How do I build an portable FM transmitter?","969","","<p>I have been bugged with the idea of building a radio in a suitcase, but I have not many clues about where to start. My idea is to make a portable FM station so podcasts can be broadcasted in a small area and later uploaded to the Internet.</p>

<p>The functions the ""case"" should accomplish are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Power the entire unit</li>
<li>Take analog MIC/Line signals in a mixer</li>
<li>(some long term magic here, such as digital processing)</li>
<li>Modulate the analog signal for FM broadcasting</li>
<li>Broadcast the signal trough a small antenna</li>
</ul>

<p>My sub-questions here are:</p>

<p>How much could it cost?
How great can I expect a ""small antenna"" to reach?
How much power do I need in relation to the whole equipment?
Which parts would I need?</p>
","<p>If the output power is low and you know programming, then you can make such a device for under $30 in parts, if we don't count the suitcase.</p>

<p>I made a device which is nearly the same as you need using a <a href=""http://www.ti.com/tool/ek-tm4c123gxl"" rel=""nofollow"">TI Tiva C launchpad</a> for 13 USD and a <a href=""https://dx.com/p/ad9850-dds-signal-generator-module-150060"" rel=""nofollow"">AD9850 board</a> for 10 USD. There are numerous similar boards on eBay and related sites, so you could get one for even less, if you shop around. You can replace the Launchpad for a similar board, such as for example <a href=""http://www.st.com/st-web-ui/active/en/catalog/tools/PF250863"" rel=""nofollow"">STM32VLDISCOVERY</a> or something like that.</p>

<p>Basically, the Launchpad has an analog to digital converter that I use to sample the audio. In my particular case, the ADC's internal reference is set to 3 V, so I used a 3.0 V voltage reference and a resistor divider plus a capacitor to move my audio input so that it's DC value is 1.5 V. </p>

<p>In the launchpad, I have a loop that samples the ADC, waits for the sampling to complete and then based on the amplitude of the signal calculates the deviation.</p>

<p>The ADC has 12 bits of resolution, so we can expect values from 0 to 4095. Using a simple proportion, you can scale that to the range of -deviation to +deviation for your band. What I did next was to add the deviation to a fixed frequency which represents input when the ADC provides zero. </p>

<p>Next step is to output the data to the AD9850 and set correct output frequency. A problem here appears if you want to use frequencies above around 40 MHz, due to the limitations of the chip. There is a way to work around that, by using harmonics of the output and a bandpass filter to just let the frequency range you want out. The procedure is explained in Analog Devices application note <a href=""http://www.analog.com/static/imported-files/application_notes/AN-543.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">AN-543: High Quality, All-Digital RF Frequency Modulation Generation with the ADSP-2181 and the AD9850 DDS</a>.</p>

<p>Using this procedure, I was able to output high-quality mono audio signal to an FM radio with very little effort.</p>

<p>The main advantage of this approach, compared to using an analog transmitter is that on the hardware side, except for the output filter, you don't really care about the frequency band you're using (as long as AD9850 can produce required frequency) and you don't care about the deviation, since you can set it in software. </p>

<p>As for the power supply, m solution requires +5 V and uses less than 100 mA and is normally powered from a USB port.</p>

<p>For the antenna, very little is needed. For example, just plugging the AD9850 module I got into a bread-board was enough to cover big part of my room. </p>

<p>In the end, be sure to monitor the output of your radio transmitter to be sure that it only outputs in the band in which you have a license to operate! Additional filtering will probably be required for that. </p>

"Effect of night on VHF/UHF propagation","964","","<p>I have had some conflicting experiences relating to the effect of night time (ionosphere, temperature, etc.) on propagation.  Perhaps it is related to the frequency of what I was working with.</p>

<p>Several years ago I troubleshot a Wi-Fi network in the desert.  Every night at a variable time (but early on in the night, say 10PM) the network would go down.  I fixed this problem by using directional antennas.  This was a ~2.45 GHz system.  So it seems the received power, or at least SNR, decreased with night.  One person I asked about it thought that it was due to increased noise (due to reflection of many other signals off the ionosphere at night).</p>

<p>Last night I looked at a broadcast FM station.  The power was pretty high.  I  just checked it out again during the day and the receive power was at least 5 dB less.  This was ~85 MHz.</p>

<p>So there are conflicting results.  One signal propagates better at night, another worse.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> What things affect VHF/UHF signal propagation at night?</p>
","<p>When we have a large temperature spread here (day/night) I start looking for new repeaters on vhf/uhf.  The gradient will usually form a temperature inversion that is pretty efficient at scattering radio signals, sometimes in very pronounced ways.  Before digital tv it wasn't uncommon to be watching a station and have another 100's of miles away completely take over the channel (with digital tv you just get a blank screen).  It's called tropospheric ducting, and could have been your culprit seeing as how temperatures differ quite a bit in an environment like the desert.  In your case it could have brought in noise from other distant wifi transmitters that blocked the signals you were trying to receive, and then disappeared when the inversions went away.</p>

<p>Moisture can also affect (attenuate) frequencies in the GHz so that may have been an issue between sites.  When you installed directional antennas you boosted the SNR by focusing all of your RF towards the desired receiver.</p>

<p>Ionospheric propagation at night doesn't typically work for any freq over about 10mhz so that is most likely not your issue.  It's fascinating stuff to learn about! </p>

So for single batteries, the only thing I've found has been something like <a href=""http://www.powerstream.com/lead-acid-12V-5A.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this charger from PowerStream</a>.</p>

<p>Will I harm these batteries by only charging them on a trickle charger? If I hook these up to my 15A MFJ power supply for a short period of time, would that hurt these batteries?</p>
","<p>You're not getting answers for multiple reasons.</p>

<p>1) Batteries are a science but its surrounded by marketing and astrological tradition (concrete floors, blah blah)</p>

<p>2) If something bad happens they are destroyed or blow up the house or start a fire and no one wants to get involved in that mess.  I guess I'm just crazy.</p>

<p>3) You're using stuff from mainland China, not exactly legendary for reliability.  So the charger you have is spec'd by its manual which I downloaded and read, to output never higher than 13.2 volts to float... and from <a href=""http://www.powerstream.com/SLA.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.powerstream.com/SLA.htm</a> its impossible to outgas explosive hydrogen unless the voltage at room temp (it varies with temp) is around 14.5 volts, so all good there, and most SLA recombinators won't vent until about C/3 charge rate and your Chinese charger theoretically only outputs 0.75 amp so its safe on any battery larger than about 3 amphours and you're at 36.  So you've got a factor of safety of more than a volt and over ten times the capacity, so IF it works to it's written specs, THEN you're totally safe.  At 3/4 amp rate, and 36 theoretical aH capacity, thats going to take more than two days to charge a completely dead battery, but it'll get there eventually.</p>

<p>The most effective way to kill a SLA is over volt it causing plate corrosion, and cheap 1970s car chargers don't voltage limit because flooded cell batteries from 1970 can have distilled water added when they outgas (unlike a SLA).  So the battery mfgr covers all bases by saying ""don't use a car charger""  But per the specs your modern trickle charger even worst case should be very safe if you compare it to typical SLA battery mfgr specs.</p>

<p>With no current limiting directly wiring the MFJ supply would just try to supply like 100 amps and blow a fuse if the battery is low.  If it doesn't blow a fuse and you do draw 15 amps (which it won't, for reasons beyond this discussion) then thats about C/2 charge rate and the recombinators in SLAs are usually rated to handle C/3 (optimistically) so you'll pop the vent and leak some acid and get to buy new batteries, which is annoying.  In summary, no, don't wire it directly to a power supply without some kind of circuitry in between, like a charger or charge controller type gadget.</p>

<p>The powerstream charger looks awesome and would make a great charger.</p>

<p>In other news ""which were probably on the shelf for years and not touched"" lead acid cells die by abuse (not a problem here) cycles (not a problem) or old age (oh oh thats a problem).  You only get ""less than a decade"" starting the instant acid hits lead back in the factory.  Just saying if it sat on the shelf for five years already, they don't really have that long to live anymore.  So on one hand if they die ""soon"" it's probably not your fault, and on the other hand if you do something bad to them they were going to the recycler soon enough anyway so you've not got much to lose.</p>

<p>Anyway 73, best of luck, de N9NFB K</p>

<ul>
<li>it is ARRL’s considered view there is no factual or legal basis for the assumption that encryption of transmissions…is necessary in order to continue and enhance the utility of Amateur Radio emergency and disaster relief communications</li>
<li>The ARRL also turned away Rolph’s assertion that the current prohibition in §97.113 “has impacted the relationship of Amateur Radio volunteers and served agencies and significantly limited the effectiveness of amateurs in supporting emergency communications.” The League said it’s unaware of any evidence that served agencies have been reluctant to utilize Amateur Radio as part of their emergency or disaster relief communications plans because of the encryption restrictions in Part 97.</li>
<li>The League characterized as “erroneous” and “unfounded” Rolph’s assumption that encryption of certain information may be required under the provisions of HIPAA — the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. </li>
<li>Radio amateurs, the ARRL countered, are not “covered entities” under HIPAA, which applies only to health care providers, health plans and health care clearinghouses. </li>
<li>there is no expectation of privacy in Amateur Radio communications.</li>
<li>There is no evidence that emergency communications has been hampered by this issue, nor that care agencies subject to HIPAA have been reluctant or unwilling to utilize Amateur Radio services in emergency communication and disaster planning</li>
<li>Adding the duty to encrypt certain transmissions to emergency communications workers would increase their workload.</li>
</ul>

<p>They did suggest that this need not be a permanent ruling, ""However, the ARRL said that should it become necessary in the future for radio amateurs to protect the privacy of individuals whose medical data may be transmitted by Amateur Radio during or after an emergency or disaster, “the Commission may be asked to revisit this matter.”</p>

I'm looking for a way to tell if a call sign is a real call sign, that works with international call signs. I'm looking for the full call sign, including after a '/'. I don't care if the call sign is actually assigned to a user, just if it is possible to assign the call to a user. I'm looking for rules as to what would be considered valid. A very general sense is okay too. I don't care if I filter something that could be a call sign, but isn't actually assigned, like <code>1S</code> prefix calls, but I do want to make sure I get special edge cases, like <code>W100AW</code>. </p>

<p>From what I can tell, the format that is valid appears to include a prefix, which can include up to 1 number and always includes 1 or 2 letters, followed by a number identifier, followed by 1-3 letters. An additional part of the call sign can be included before or after the call that can include a lot of things, including a <code>/AE</code>,<code>/AG</code>,<code>/KH6</code> (Or other prefix), and possibly other things as well, which I'm not really certain of. I'm looking for something like this, but preferably more detailed.</p>

<p>Basically, I'm trying to tell if a callsign is likely to be real, so I can check to see if I have an invalid call sign in my logging program. </p>
","<p>Callsigns, per ITU regulations, consist of a prefix and a suffix.  The prefix must be obtained from this table:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.itu.int/online/mms/glad/cga_callsign.sh?lng=E"">Table of International Call Sign Series (Appendix 42 to the RR)</a></p>

<p>And is assigned on a per-country basis.  The suffix is then determined by that country's internal radio regulations, and there is no standard that will make this easy for you.  You'll need to research each country's regulation and standard and include hundreds of different rules if you need to determine validity to that degree.</p>

<p>However, you can eliminate a lot of bad callsigns simply by verifying that the prefix is valid, using the above list.</p>

<p>The general guidelines on the formation of a whole callsign, including what the suffix may contain, are fairly well explained in this wikipedia article:</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITU_prefix_-_amateur_and_experimental_stations"">ITU prefix (amateur stations)</a></p>

<p>There are rare exceptions, but generally you start with the country prefix, add a numeral, then add a suffix of between 1 and 4 alphanumeric characters. The last character has to be a letter, not a number, but otherwise there's no regulation internationally.  </p>

"Does a larger Biquad antenna give better results?","918","","<p>Consider a biquad antenna used for receiving, not for sending. They are typically built with each side having a length of $\lambda / 4$.</p>

<p>If a biquad antenna was built with a side length of $\lambda / 2$ or even $\lambda$, would this give better results (for receiving)? If yes, how much better?</p>
","<p>You need some theory to answer this - it's not entirely simple.</p>

<p>Consider that each quad loop really consists of 2 dipoles, with the ends connected together (at the corners of the quad). So, each quad loop really acts as two dipoles located parallel to each other. (The reflected loop, in a similar way, consists of two of these 'pseudo-dipoles').</p>

<p>So, if you then consider what would happen if you would <em>extend</em> the dipole to double its length: Instead of one dipole (which has low impedance at its center), you'd have two dipoles, which have a very high impedance at the center - almost impossible to feed (thousands of Ohms). But it would still be possible.</p>

<p>What's not so interesting is that a large part of the field irradiated by the dipoles would cancel each other (because they're too close), so you would probably 'feel' a slight improvement, but not nearly what you'd expect from such an effort.</p>

<p>Edit: Modified the text slightly to - hopefully - make it less confusing thanks for the remark, Phil). Making use of the edit, do note that if you'd extend the sides to 3/4$\lambda$ you'd actually get 3 dipoles and low impedance. But again, the gain won't be what you'd expect, as, again, parts will cancel. Moreover, if you'd think about using the biquad as a feed for a parabola, you'd be covering a much larger part of the useful area.</p>

"Programming VHF To CB","914","","<p>New to this particular site on StackExchange and new to amateur radio period so bear with me:</p>

<p>I'm looking into buying a VHF radio for work related purposes. More specifically the Icom IC-2300H.</p>

<p>I've been wondering if it was possible to program a VHF radio to run on CB radio frequencies?</p>

<p>I've done some searching but didn't find anything on the topic, but I may not be using the correct keywords.</p>

<p>I'm not familiar with the various radio frequencies and types.</p>

<p>I'm not looking to specifically use this radio for the purpose of cb, but just the possibility of.</p>
","<p>CB or its close relatives fall into the HF frequency range (covering somewhere around 26 to 28 MHz, depending on country), so anything that accurately calls itself a VHF radio will not transmit (and most likely will not receive) CB.</p>

<p>In general, what you do to answer this kind of question is find the radio's <em>specifications</em> — either <a href=""http://www.icomamerica.com/en/products/amateur/mobile/2300h/specifications.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">on the web site</a> or in the user's manual which will often be available as a PDF — and look for the transmit and receive frequency ranges. You can see that this radio's lowest receive frequency is 136 MHz, somewhat below the low end of the 2-meter amateur band. Therefore it cannot receive or transmit on CB frequencies.</p>

<p>(Another issue is whether it supports the relevant modulation, or <em>mode</em> — which in this case is also a problem, because this radio supports only FM whereas CB is conventionally AM and sometimes SSB.)</p>

<p>You also cannot use this radio “for work related purposes” unless you are intending to receive only and not transmit. This is because it will only transmit on the amateur bands, where any use for which you receive compensation is prohibited. Outside the amateur bands, all other frequencies you might legitimately use in the US (I see your location from your profile) require “certified” (formerly “type accepted”) equipment, which in practice means equipment that transmits on that band or frequency <em>only</em>.</p>

"Is a ground plane necessary for transmitting and receiving with a vertical (monopole) antenna?","912","","<p>I've read the post here:</p>

<p>which says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The antenna system requires a ""ground plane"" for the radio wave to form. With dipoles, one half of the antenna is your ground. In verticals, something below must provide ground to complete the RF wave. This is usually achieved with radials, either attached to the base of the vertical, or buried below a ground mounted antenna. The presence of a metal mast/tower (which is lightning grounded) may contribute/interfere with the ground plane but it is not considered the antenna ground.</blockquote>
  But, for example, 2m verticals on boats don't have ground planes. Two questions. </p>


<ol>
<li><p>Am I right in saying that a ground plane results in optimal radiation, but that radiation will still take place without one e.g. boats antennas still reach the horizon, though likely height and more power are required.</p></li>
<li><p>Is a ground plane necessary for receiving? </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks for reading</p>
","<p>Every antenna has two halves, meeting at the feed point (where the coax or other transmission line is attached). Both halves affect the properties of the antenna (radiation pattern, efficiency, etc.).</p>

<p>A vertical element and a ground plane is <strong>just one possibility</strong> for what those two halves can be. If you omit the ground plane from a ground plane antenna, then there are only two possibilities for what happens:</p>

<ul>
<li>You have an ineffective antenna — it does not radiate/receive well.</li>
<li>Something else is serving as the ‘second half’.</li>
</ul>

<p>In most designs of coax-fed antennas, what ends up being that second half is the shield of the coax cable and (if applicable) the conductive metal structure the antenna is mounted to. I don't know how antennas on boats usually are, but I bet there's a metal structure there.</p>

<p>This <em>can</em> work fine, but there are two potential problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>This conductive shape wasn't particularly designed to be an antenna, so it may not have the best characteristics for that (irregular radiation pattern, lossy, wrong impedance, etc.).</li>
<li>It may be closer to other electronic equipment, the operator, etc. and thus (for receiving) pick up extra noise or (for transmitting) deliver significant RF energy where it is not wanted.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're interested only in receiving for now, put up whatever antenna you can and don't worry too much. If you find you need better performance from your antenna, install a proper ground plane or other design of antenna.</p>

Beyond the laws I would recommend following the band plans for where to transmit and pay attention to where the signals from your buoy would reach.  For example, the lower end of the 70cm band isn't part of the allowed spectrum in Canada so when I go much farther North I have to pay attention and not transmit on some frequencies I can use in the US.</p>

"How do I connect a GPS receiver to a radio for APRS?","895","","<p>I volunteer with the local search and rescue group as a team medic and a radio operator. The team is new and recently decided to go with the Garmin 64st as our go-to GPS units. Those of us with licenses use the cheaper Baofeng UV-5R and BF-8HP radios. I was volun-told to look into pairing our GPS to the radios for APRS use. I’ve searched around and haven’t found any definitive information, although from what I could find, I gather that NMEA is needed on the GPS to make it work, which our units do have. </p>

<p>I want to know if it’s possible to use the two together, and if so, how.</p>
","<p><em>Disclaimer: I have no experience with any of the below matters; I'm just writing an explanation of what I've heard.</em></p>

<p>Neither your radio nor your GPS unit knows how to encode APRS packets. Therefore you will need to add a device which does, and will also perform the other control/interface functions.</p>

<p>In general, a hardware device which encodes and AFSK-modulates (and in cases other than this, also decodes) APRS packets is known as a TNC, or a tracker for the specific case of sending position reports.</p>

<p>Here's an example of a product that you could use: <a href=""http://www.byonics.com/tinytrak/"" rel=""nofollow"">Byonics TinyTrak3</a>. <strong>I am not recommending this product;</strong> it's just one that I remember people talking about (I haven't personally used such devices).</p>

<p>Since your radios don't know about APRS and don't have an external control interface, you will necessarily be transmitting your position reports on the same frequency as your voice communication (unless you're using a separate radio for APRS). This isn't a critical problem (and CTCSS can be used to mute the data packets for listeners), it just means a little more activity, and that your packets won't go onto the regular APRS network unless you set up your own digipeater or IGate.</p>

<p>Also note that one of the features of the product I linked is “Burst after voice / Send Position Now input”. This means you get to control the timing of the packet versus your other use of the radio, which is appropriate here, as opposed to a completely autonomous system that transmits position reports automatically and does nothing else with its radio.</p>

"How to stop interference on shortwave radio when connecting to a computer","888","","<p>I have a Tecsun PL-600 and when I can receive clear signals, and they come through just fine on headphones, and through the speaker. If I'm trying to receive RTTY or fax, when I connect the radio to my computer the signal becomes inaudible because a huge amount of interference comes through. It only happens when connecting the radio to the computer, so I assume it's something to do with interference going into the radio through the audio cable. But I have no clue if that's even possible.</p>

Be warned that both the audio clips are quite loud, especially the one with the noise.</p>
","<p>I listened to your samples and I can say that I've never heard interference that sounded like wind on a microphone before. It doesn't sound like typical RFI, but it still could be. It doesn't sound like clipping either.</p>

<p>Regardless, some things worth trying (including those already mentioned in other answers, to be complete) are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Change the antenna</strong>; in particular, use an external antenna which is either <strong>balanced</strong> (dipole) and has a balun, or is <strong>grounded</strong> (actual earth ground at the spot, not electrical service ground) at the feed point. This helps prevent conducted noise from your equipment from being received.</p>

<p>(If you set up a outdoor antenna, grounded or otherwise, then I recommend either disconnecting it whenever there may be a thunderstorm, or doing further research on effective ground systems. This is a nontrivial problem.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Improving <em>or removing</em> equipment grounding</strong>, where by the latter I mean <strong>running on batteries instead of AC adapter</strong>. Removing grounding may be useful if you have a <em>ground loop</em> problem rather than an RFI problem per se. First, if you live in an older building, make sure that the electrical outlets are actually grounded. Then, try these four configurations — just to be complete:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Computer and radio grounded. (Ideally, this would be best, but depending on the equipment it could result in ground loop noise.)</p>

<p>Use a multimeter to confirm that the radio's power adapter has continuity between the AC earth pin and the (-) terminal of the DC plug (identified by the symbol on the radio's input and possibly on the adapter itself). If it's not grounded, you could try replacing it with one that is, but there might be something “interesting” about the radio circuit and I'd instead think about grounding at the antenna jack instead.</p></li>
<li><p>Computer and radio ungrounded, running off battery power. (This requires a laptop computer or similar, of course.) If you get less noise here, then it could be a ground loop or it could be noise from the AC power adapter of one or both devices.</p></li>
<li><p>Computer grounded, radio ungrounded. </p></li>
<li><p>Computer ungrounded, radio grounded. This is likely to be the worst case, but if it <em>doesn't</em> add more noise, then your problem is something else.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Use a different audio interface.</strong> Get a decent quality USB audio interface/sound card (different words for the same thing) and use its input instead. (Make sure it has a line-level input, not a microphone input.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use an isolation device</strong> — which could be an optical isolator, as already mentioned, or a 1:1 transformer — in the audio line. I note that some of the designs in that PDF do not isolate ground, which may or may not be a good idea.</p></li>

"How can I change my ""home"" registration server for D-STAR?","861","","<p>How do you cancel a D-STAR user registration from one local repeater and re-register with a <em>different</em> local repeater?</p>

<p>I can't seem to find any documentation on this.</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>

<p>D-STAR requires that users first register their callsign with a local repeater in order to route traffic across the D-STAR network. This is done via web server, run by the operator of said local repeater.</p>

<p>Once you've registered with any one repeater, that registration becomes valid for every other repeater in the world. The US Trust database is used to share registrations amongst D-STAR repeaters, as well as keep track of the last known repeater for each callsign (so that direct traffic can be routed correctly).</p>

<p>Given this, it's not surprising that there's not much demand for moving a registration; it would seem most folks just register once and leave things as-is.</p>

<p>However, my understanding is that it's still best to register with the repeater used most frequently, since that's the default used for routing messages to you if your radio hasn't been heard for awhile. (For example, if a friend is trying to contact you directly, and you haven't transmitted in a very long time, the message may get routed to your home repeater.)</p>

<p>I just can't find any way to actually do this.</p>
","<p>It has been about a year since I have administered a US Trust System gateway, but I believe you would need to contact the administrator of the old gateway; they would delete you from the gateway, and then you can register with the newer gateway.</p>

<p>Although it is a guideline, I wouldn't think it is a necessity to move your registration.  Since we do not run the US Trust system on our gateway locally, I'm registered with a US Trust gateway a few hours away.</p>

<p><a href=""http://what-if.xkcd.com/71/"" rel=""nofollow"">Water is hard to beat in both respects</a>. The trouble is it has this tendency to become a conductor as it dissolves salts, so it must be insulated, or somehow kept very pure. Sometimes the trouble of this is too much, so some sort of oil is easier.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_capacity"" rel=""nofollow"">Heat capacity</a> is perhaps the relevant physical property here. <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=specific+heat+capacity+water"" rel=""nofollow"">The specific heat capacity of liquid water</a> is about $4.8J/(gK)$, and since 1mL of water weighs about 1g, we can also say the volumetric heat capacity of liquid water is about $4.8J/(mLK)$. We know that $W=1J/s$, and from these two things, given a power, and some volume of water, we can calculate at what rate the temperature will rise, if the temperature is uniform throughout, and no heat energy is being lost elsewhere. Let's use 100W and 1L as an example:</p>

<p>$$ \require{cancel}
\frac{100\cancel{J}}{s}
\cdot \frac{\cancel{mL}K}{4.8\cancel{J}}
\cdot \frac{1}{1000\cancel{mL}}
= 0.21\frac{K}{s}\\
$$</p>

<p>Since we are talking about a rate of change, you might as well consider $K=^\circ C$.</p>

<p>Of course, this involves two assumptions we know to not be true, the first being that the temperature of the water (or whatever coolant) is uniform everywhere. If the coolant is actively stirred, then it might be close enough to true. Otherwise, you are dependent on conductive currents and conduction to distribute the heat energy throughout the coolant, some parts are hotter and some are cooler, but the average temperature increases at this rate.</p>

<p>But this is somewhat moot, given the second assumption: that no heat energy is otherwise being lost. Probably you won't wrap the dummy load in blankets then operate it until it overheats, but rather construct it with a surface designed to radiate heat into the ambient environment well enough that it can be operated indefinitely without overheating. The job of the coolant is really just to provide a good thermal coupling between the heat sink and the heat sources, and to average out any transient thermal loads.</p>

<p>The relevant physical property for the heatsink is absolute <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_resistance"" rel=""nofollow"">thermal resistance</a>. This quantity has units $K/W$ and tells you, for a given constant power, what the temperature increase above ambient will be. It will be specified by the manufacturer's datasheet. You also need to add to this the thermal resistance of everything between the heat sources and the heat sink. Unfortunately calculating the absolute thermal resistance of your tank of coolant is hard, because it has a complex geometry, and the things likely to be used in the tank (water, oil) are actually not especially good thermal conductors: they move the heat around mostly by convection.</p>

<p>So, the general approach is this: figure out, for your design power and allowable temperature rise, how big the heatsink would need to be assuming the best case, then make it bigger to account for other factors. <a href=""http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=TLAR"" rel=""nofollow"">TLAR</a> is probably the most economical method, and if you need something more precise, then pump a known power into a prototype, and if it gets too hot, make it bigger.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are there any non-obvious safety concerns I need to think about when constructing and using this? I don't want to miss anything simple but obscure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Besides the obvious ones of having a potentially large quantity of possibly flammable, probably very hot fluid, potentially heated beyond its boiling point, connected to an electrical energy source that might be capable of generating sparks or heating (especially under fault conditions) materials above said fluid's flash point? No, I can't really think of any. I don't think it's the non-obvious safety concerns that are going to kill you.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a sealed system like this, is there any risk of explosion due to pressure from the liquid heating?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very yes, see last question. I wouldn't seal it if I could help it, and if I did, I'd be sure it wasn't sealed very well, so an overpressure fault would just dribble rather than explode. Also couldn't hurt to make sure the pressure release mechanism indeed <em>dribbles</em> and not <em>shoots a hot jet of oil</em>. </p>

","<p>It can be done! Remember that a transmission line consists of some self-inductance per unit length, and some capacitance per unit length, and the ratio of these determines the line's characteristic impedance:</p>

<p>$$ Z_0=\sqrt{\frac{R+j\omega L}{G+j\omega C}} $$</p>

<p>Intuitively then, a lumped element implementation might look like some series inductance and some parallel capacitance. We need something that's symmetrical, so a pi network<sup>1</sup> like this should do it:</p>

<p>All we have to do is determine the appropriate values. Since transmission lines work in both directions this arrangement is going to be symmetrical, so C1 = C2. And as it turns out, the values are very elegant: the reactance of the components is equal to the characteristic impedance.
Put mathematically:</p>

<p>$$ X_{L1} = Z_0 \\
X_{C1} = Z_0 $$</p>

<p>And while we're at it, let's review the formulae for reactance:</p>

<p>$$ X_L = 2 \pi f L \\
X_C = 1 / (2 \pi f C) $$</p>

<p>Putting those together, with a bit of algebra, you get:</p>

<p>$$ L = {Z_0 \over 2 \pi f} $$</p>

<p>$$ C = {1 \over 2 \pi f Z_0} $$</p>

<p>Let's say we want a characteristic impedance of 86.6 ohms so we can realize a <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/a/6202/218"">3-way Wilkinson power splitter</a>. We'll use the frequency 435 MHz for the middle of the 70cm band.</p>

<p>Bingo! The impedance transforming properties of a quarter wave transmission line are also preserved: if the output is open, the source will see a short, and so on. So this circuit can be used in place anywhere that calls for a quarter-wave transmission line.</p>

"Is it possible to power your ham radio station by solar power? If so, how?","845","","<p>The very first New York Times article announcing the invention of the solar cell by Bell Labs in 1954 shows a man holding a brick-shaped device in the sun in one hand and a microphone in the other hand, while standing far away from any other sources of power.  </p>

<p>The combination of wireless energy and wireless communication is very compelling.  </p>

<p>Clearly they thought the most obvious first use case for solar energy would be for communications.</p>

<p>So the question is in the title:  Is it possible to power your ham radio station by solar power? If so, how?</p>
","<p>The answer is a resounding yes.</p>

<p>How you do it depends on whether you are mobile (like in an RV) or stationary.</p>

<p><a href=""https://youtu.be/g-hqt6pvGxo"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Here is a video answer from David Casler, KE0OG</a>, the <code>Original Genius</code>, who both answers the first question and also the second. This video is a good introduction. </p>

<p>Key fact that must be stressed:  <strong>A solar charge controller is required to properly maintain the battery bank.  The batteries are the key component to the system.</strong>  </p>

<hr>

<p>Here is a plot of my first-generation single Marine battery system with a 50 Watt PV panel and a PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) charge controller, which is still in use outside to power the electronics and the motors that sense the position of the sun and position the panels. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JUuPv.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JUuPv.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>This shows a healthy system for the purpose for which it is being used.  But it would not be adequate for powering ham radios while charging. </p>

<hr>

<p>On the other hand, MPPT controllers (explained in the video), provide a much cleaner charging waveform:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jaqpi.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jaqpi.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Note that the waveforms at the battery bank do not contain much radio hash.</p>

<p>This plot was taken on a day when the inverter was not turned on, for the purpose of showing the charging modes:  boost then float.  </p>

<p>It also includes the yellow marker where the time of day would have shut the inverter off, causing the automatic relay to switch the AC portion of the system back to house power.</p>

<p><strong>Note also that with the MPPT controller all the panels are wired in series to provide high voltage which is converted to charging current at the Maximum Power Point.</strong></p>

<p>Here is the Renogy Commander MPPT charge controller:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xd0Pm.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xd0Pm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<hr>

<p>The battery bank is built as a set of 4 deep-cycle Marine 12V 122 Ah batteries in series/parallel, resulting in a 24 Volt battery bank of 244 Ah.  </p>

<p>Fully charged to 25.2 Volts, there is 6.15 kWh stored in the battery bank.</p>

<p>That is a LOT of power so they are protected in battery boxes and with circuit breakers (one for each output pole).  </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DWnzx.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DWnzx.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BBUaR.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BBUaR.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p><strong>It is very important that the breakers be mounted directly at the batteries.</strong></p>

<p>They also serve as cutoff switches.  </p>

<p>Handling of conductive tools is a critical issue when the boxes are open, as this kind of power can melt steel in an instant.</p>

<p><strong>Safety first.</strong>  </p>

<p>The breakers are inside two of the battery boxes to provide positive and negative terminals.  Cutouts in the box lids provide physical access to the switches and reset levers.</p>

<hr>

<p>Dave goes on at length in the video about how shading can affect solar panels - but the panels used here contain bypass diodes at each cell so they exhibit graceful degradation in a partial shading scenario.  The rest of the panel with direct exposure will still pump out the electrons.  </p>

<p>These are relatively new panels (priced at just over a dollar per watt) which contain reverse-voltage blocking diodes to prevent any possibility of them becoming a power sink.  </p>

<p>This location has a lot of trees on the west side, so when the shading starts it is fairly decisive, as can be seen in the lower chart.  But it is clear that they continue to collect useful sunlight from the atmosphere past the times of direct exposure.  </p>

<p>These panels are mounted on open frames for maximum cooling airflow - heat adversely affects output.  Rooftop mounts must allow for some airflow under the panels.</p>

<p>After the 4pm cutoff there is enough sun to top off the battery bank for the night.</p>

<hr>

<p>Generally the Inverter is on from 9am to 4pm (7 hours) with a 300 Watt load which is used for my little home and for charging the batteries.  It tallies up nicely:</p>

<p>$$ 0.300 \mathrm{\,kW} \times 7 \mathrm{\,h} = 2.1 \mathrm{\,kWh} $$</p>

<p>Carrying this further to 30 days, monthly AC power production is:</p>

<p>$$ 2.1 \mathrm{\,kWh} \times 30 = 63 \mathrm{\,kWh} $$</p>

<hr>

<p>There are 3 pairs of 100 Watt PV panels all wired in series, providing up to about 120 Volts.  </p>

<p>The power is brought in from the panels with 8 Gauge cables which present very little resistance over the 10 meter run, at this amperage.  Generally the current is in the 4 Amp range.</p>

<p>This particular Charge Controller includes a remote meter that constantly shows the input and battery voltages.  </p>

<p><strong>Notice that with PWM it is not possible to run voltages this high.  The way they work you are limited to an input voltage just slightly higher than the maximum charging voltage.  So the panels are run in parallel, which means the current is higher for the same amount of power.</strong>  </p>

<p>This has a major impact on the cable size as you might try to pull the same amount of power due to resistance at the required amperage.  </p>

<p>$$ P_{\text{loss}} = I^2\times R $$</p>

<p>Cable is expensive, so this needs to be considered in comparing the price of PWM vs MPPT especially for long cable runs.  With cable runs of any length the savings in cable cost can pay for the difference in price between PWM and MPPT</p>

<hr>

<p>Inside, where the PV power lands there is another of the same kind of Marine-grade circuit breaker/cutoff switch for the panel input.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These voltages can be quite uncomfortable if not lethal.  It is always good to use the left-hand-rule when working on this kind of circuitry:  Keep your left hand behind your back so any discharge will not go through your heart.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>The MPPT controller operates on an entirely different principle.  Nothing like the switching action of PWM.</p>

<p>This chart shows the difference:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/I5PKn.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/I5PKn.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>This Renogy Commander MPPT controller is well worth the price. </p>

<hr>

<p>For 12V radios there is a 24V to 12V converter unit like this:</p>

<p>Note that the converter is also a regulator, so the resultant 12 Volt power is nice and clean.  </p>

I have insulated solid core copper wire, but I need to make it perfectly straight. I was thinking of using the type of sticks you set next to plants to support them while growing but perhaps there is a better, less ugly way. What do you suggest?</p>
","<p>Based on the information you have given in the post and comments, the simplest way to construct a ""omni"" for 433 MHz, is by using an SO239-chassis-connector, and solder/screw the antenna elements directly onto the connector. Make sure the ground-plane elements are bended down, to ensure a close match to 50Ohm impendance.</p>

<p>The single-strand/1mm wire will do nicely without supports.</p>

"SSB demodulation","817","","<p>I was building the superhet receiver for ham radio. But I seem to have got stuck at the demodulation stage. </p>

<p>As an example: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose the person is transmitting SSB signal (20m band) at 14.250 MHz carrier frequency. </p>
  
  <p>Let the speech signal occupy 1KHz bandwidth. </p>
  
  <p>So the RF signal using Upper Side Band is 14.251 MHz. </p>
  
  <p>I take intermediate frequency of 455 KHz.</p>
  
  <p>So my Local oscillator is set to 14.251 + 0.455 = 14.706 MHz.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now at the demodulator, the 455 KHz wave is needed to be demodulated. For this particular example, the oscillator frequency I need to inject in demodulator is 456 KHz (to recover 1 KHz speech).</p>

<p>Firstly, am I going wrong somewhere till now?</p>

<p>Secondly, in real situation, I would not be knowing this much information. The only thing I would be knowing is that my Mixer oscillator is set to 14.706 MHz. So the Rf freq must be 14.251 MHz. Now here is the problem:</p>

<p>This 14.251 MHz could be a 14.250 MHz carrier with 1 KHZ sideband or it can be a 14.249 MHz carrier with 2 KHz sideband or any other pair of values. So how do I demodulate?</p>

<p>In other words, how do I know what frequency to inject in the demodulator? Do I just keep tuning the oscillator attached to the demodulator until the combination is struck? </p>

<p>If yes, then wouldn't finding any random person over this  wide range of band quite painful; First you set the Mixer oscillator to some value and then you keep tuning the demodulating oscillator over the entire 3 or 4 KHz bandwidth until you find someone?</p>
","<p>To understand better, I'd suggest you follow this:</p>

<p>1) If you have an AM transmitter at 10.000 MHz (let's use simple numbers). If someone whistles in the microphone, at, say, 1kHz, two sidebands will appear, at
9.999MHz and 10.001 MHz (and a carrier at 10.000MHz).</p>

<p>2) If you convert the AM tx into USB, and transmit at 10.000 MHz, the whistler will appear at 10.001 MHz (only). </p>

<p>3) If you want to <em>hear</em> the whistle at 1kHz, you will have to insert a carrier at 10.000 MHz again. Any other frequency will change the tone of the whistle. (This is how direct conversion works).</p>

<p>4) So, if you IF is 0.5 MHz (again simple numbers), your tuning oscillator should be 9.500 MHz, resulting in the whistler being at 0.501 MHz. You would then need a carrier inserted at 0.500 MHz to get the whistle correct.</p>

<p>5) The voice passband should ideally be around 0.3 to 2.5 kHz, so you IF filter should pass from 0.5003 to 0.5025 MHz.</p>

<p>This is not overly complicated - in a superhet receiver, you will have a carrier oscillator at 0.500MHz, a tuning oscillator which varies in the range 0.5 MHz below the desired band, and the filter as described in  5).</p>

<p>And yes, tuning SSB is not easy - you have to be at less than 100 Hz (!) of the correct frequency to have an enjoyable voice reception. The problem isn't so much with a one-note whistler, but if (s)he whistles a melody, all notes will be off, making it sound very strange.</p>

<p>Note that 'demodulating' SSB is just mixing frequencies, just like mixing from 10.000 to 0.500 MHz - an SSB demodulator is just a mixer.</p>

"Why does ""high SWR"" damage transmitters, instead of ""impedance mismatch""?","807","","<p>In the audio realm, where cable lengths are insignificant compared to the signal wavelength, I would understand an impedance mismatch damaging an amplifier as follows:</p>

<p>Take an audio amplifier that can deliver 100 watts of power into an 8 ohm speaker driver. So under normal operating conditions, by <code>P = R * I^2</code>, there would be 3.5A of current flowing to deliver these 100W. If this amplifier were connected instead to 2 ohm speakers, it would need to pass 7A of current assuming it will still attempt to deliver this same 100W.</p>

<p>Viewed even more simply: a 2 ohm load tends to ""short circuit"" an amp designed for an 8 ohm load. Further to this logic, connecting the same amplifier to a 32 ohm load would not hurt it, as the resulting current would be smaller than expected.</p>

<hr>

<p>With radio frequency, we don't really worry about the impedance being ""too low"" but rather ""too mismatched"" and we use SWR to represent this mismatch.</p>

<p>Why in RF is connecting a 500 ohm load i.e. 10:1 SWR, to my amplifier's 50 ohm output, considered equally bad as causing a 10:1 SWR by connecting a 5 ohm load instead?</p>

<p>Do the two 10:1 SWR cases cause amplifier failure for different reasons? I wonder if in the 5 ohm case it is just a simple ""too much current"" like in the audio case, but in the 500 ohm case the transmission line somehow ends up increasing the <em>voltage</em> beyond what the transistors can handle.</p>

<p>Does it make any difference if we eliminate the transmission line altogether, so that standing waves can't really develop? Would it be okay to connect a high-impedance antenna feedpoint <em>directly</em> to a transmitter without problems, whereas a low-impedance antenna might still cause an overcurrent condition?</p>
","<p>The VSWR isn't the problem <em>per se</em>, it's just the impedance that appears at the transmitter's terminals. Take the load at the end of the transmission line, transform it according to the electrical length of the feedline, and put that equivalent impedance right at the transmitter's terminals and you will have the same damage.</p>

<p>A particular VSWR can result in a range of impedances. For example 5:1 on a 50 ohm line can mean 10 ohms, 250 ohms, and a range of complex impedances in between. Some of those impedances may damage the transmitter, others may not. But since the length of the feedline isn't known, it's safest to keep the VSWR low.</p>

<p>So why can a mismatched load cause damage? In summary, the transmitter's final stage is made of reactive components, that is components that store and release energy. These reactive components are selected to have the load absorb some of that stored energy. Without that load absorbing energy, the energy instead appears as a high voltage or high current to appear somewhere which may not be equipped to handle it.</p>

<p>Let's give a very simple example to illustrate: a very simplified class-C common-source amplifier. You've probably seen such amplifiers with a resistor in place of L1, but for power amplifiers it's more common to use inductors to avoid the associated resistive losses.</p>



<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YVfW7.png"" alt=""schematic""></p>



<p><sup><a href=""/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fYVfW7.png"">simulate this circuit</a> &ndash; Schematic created using <a href=""https://www.circuitlab.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">CircuitLab</a></sup></p>

<p>When the transistor is on, current through L1 increases and L1 stores energy. Let's say it's on long enough for current through L1 to rise to 1A. When the transistor is off, the voltage across the load will rise to 50V, because that's what it takes for 1A to pass through 50Ω. So we need M1 to have $V_\text{ds(max)} &gt; 50\:\mathrm V$.</p>

<p>What happens if the load is open? Since no current can flow through the load, the voltage will rise even higher, whatever it takes to get 1A to continue flowing through L1. In this case it will be whatever voltage causes M1 to go into avalanche breakdown. RF power transistors aren't usually avalanche rated, so this means damage.</p>

<p>You can imagine other situations that lead to excessive drain current in M1 as well.</p>

<p>Of course, a real transmitter will be more complicated. It will probably have a low-pass filter on its output, multiple transistors with complex impedances at RF, and more reactive components within for impedance matching and filtering. All these values are selected with the assumption of a 50 ohm resistive load. Which load impedances will cause failure depend on the particular topology of the amplifier.</p>

"SDR with the Raspberry Pi","801","","<p>I wanted to explore digital modes by connecting a Raspberry Pi via audio cables to a transceiver. However, I realized that thanks to the clock generator, the raspberry pi can produce RF signals directly. Adding a square to sine wave converter, a band pass filter and an amplifier, this could be used as the transmitter. There is good software in <a href=""http://gnuradio.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">GNU Radio</a> and <a href=""https://github.com/F5OEO/rpitx"" rel=""noreferrer"">PiTx</a>. FM signals can be produced. As far as I can tell it is possible to generate SSB directly on the pi but I haven't understood yet how. </p>

<p><strong>Q1: Is it possible to directly generate SSB on the pi?</strong></p>

<p>On the receiver side, things look a bit more tricky. It requires a down converter and a very fast analog to digital converter. The good news is that they appear to be very cheap, e.g. <a href=""http://www.rtl-sdr.com/buy-rtl-sdr-dvb-t-dongles/"" rel=""noreferrer"">R820T2</a></p>

<p><strong>Q2: Would combining a cheap dongle such as the R820T2 enable me to operate in half-duplex mode with the Raspberry Pi?</strong></p>

<p>I'm mainly interested in playing with the radio, so any band is fine. If I were forced to choose, I would prefer 50MHz.</p>

<p>Apologies for this open-ended question, any suggestions welcome. </p>

","<p>Yes, with some important qualifications, you can ""directly"" generate SSB on the Raspberry Pi. The <a href=""https://github.com/F5OEO/rpitx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">rpitx software</a> you mention does that, and in combination with an RTL-SDR type dongle you would indeed have a sort of half-duplex transceiver. So in short: yes (Q1) and yes (Q2).</p>

<p>Based on that exact combination, <a href=""https://github.com/ha7ilm/qtcsdr"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">qtcsdr</a> is an app that aims to make your Raspberry Pi into a amateur radio transceiver.</p>

<p>Of course, all the filtering that goes into both a good receiver and — more exigently — a <strong>legal</strong> transmitter are ""sold separately""! This is the most important qualification.</p>

<p>I would assume that rpitx (and qtcsdr, which uses it) generates a much, much messier signal than even the most infamous CB amplifier driven hard.

"How do I determine which HT antenna is better based on their very similar catalogue descriptions?","800","","<p>I'm considering getting an after-market antenna for my new 2 m/70 cm HT and am trying to decide which of the two antennas I should get. My primary reason for considering an alternative antenna is improved RX/TX performance. </p>

<p>Both antennas in their specifications on the manufacturers web-site say following:</p>

<p>Maximum power: 10 W, gain 2.15 dBi, 1/4 wave on 2m, 1/2 wave on 70 cm, both have appropriate connector and impedance, both have specified SWR as less or equal to 1:1.5. </p>

<p>The only difference between them is that one antenna is 19 cm long and the other antenna is 36 cm long. </p>

<p>After doing some research on the internet, I've noticed that a large number of HT antennas have extremely similar technical specifications, with only difference being the antenna length. I've also read very vague and general descriptions saying that longer HT antenna==better HT antenna.</p>

<p>So how do I determine which antenna is better based on provided information?</p>

<p>By the way, I want to keep the question as general as possible, so I didn't mention models until now, but they are Diamond SRH-701S and Diamond SRH-536.</p>
","<p>Catalog descriptions are bogus. What they are describing are characteristics of monopole antennas in general, not either <em>specific</em> model.</p>

<p>Clearly, they can't both be 1/4 wave antennas at the same frequency but also be different lengths. A 1/4 wave at 145 MHz is about 49 cm. Neither one is a 1/4 wave antenna,. What they probably are is <em>electrically</em> a 1/4 wave, made electrically longer than they physically are with a loading coil. The more loading, the shorter the antenna, and everything else being equal, the less efficient the radiator.</p>

<p>They also both quote gain as 2.15 dBi. This is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipole_antenna#Half-wave_dipole"" rel=""noreferrer"">theoretical gain of a half-wave dipole in free space</a>. An ideal quarter-wave monopole is equivalent to a dipole, and has the same gain. It doesn't sound like they made any actual measurement of either antenna's gain. These antennas have <em>significant</em> deviation from the ideal models: they have loading coils, they are over (lossy) Earth, and they lack a ground plane that's anything close to ideal.</p>

<p>Absent accurate specifications from the manufacturer or vendor, it's true of all antennas that longer is better, up to the point that the antenna is self-resonant. To make it shorter requires the addition of reactive components that don't contribute to radiation and must necessarily introduce additional loss if constructed of real materials.</p>

"How many frequency channels are there in a frequency band?","798","","<p>I've often heard people saying that 4G uses the 1800 MHz band but precisely what all frequencies does it work upon? Does it mean that is just uses one frequency i.e. 1800 MHz, well in that case wouldn't there be interference among signals carrying different data.</p>

<ol>
<li>What is the difference between a frequency band and frequency channel?</li>
<li>Why don't we directly use frequency ranges to tell what a particular technology operates upon instead of telling what band it uses. For example, why do we say that 4G uses 1800 MHz band instead of saying it uses frequencies between X MHz and Y MHz. Wouldn't it be easier to understand?</li>
</ol>
","<p>A frequency band represents a range of frequencies, which are usually defined by law or regulation.  For instance, the 1800 MHz GSM band ranges from 1710.2 MHz to 1879.8 MHz, according to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM_frequency_bands"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>.  Bands are wide enough to contain many signals without interference (universally, as far as I know).  Because the frequency bands for a particular service are generally widely-spaced, it's usually quite clear what you mean by the usual shorthand definition of a band, if you're looking at a table showing the frequency ranges for the various bands for a particular service.  Yes, it would be more clear to say ""the 1710.2 to 1879.8 MHz band"", but ""the 1800 MHz band"" rolls off the tongue much more easily.  In amateur radio practice, the shorthand name for a band usually refers to its approximate wavelength in meters rather than the frequency, for historical reasons; for instance, the ""20m band"" in the US ranges from 14 &ndash; 14.350 MHz.</p>

<p>A channel is also a frequency range, which is usually defined by law, regulation, or general practice.  However a channel is usually much narrower than a band, because a channel is typically only wide enough for a single signal.  The intent of dividing a band into channels is to prevent interference.  Sometimes channels are given numbers, but not always.  Not all services are channelized; the amateur radio service generally uses unnumbered channels for VHF and UHF FM, according to state-wide (US) or nation-wide band plans, and the 60m band is channelized in the US because it is shared with federal government users, but other bands are usually not channelized.  In other words, operators using other ham bands can generally select any frequency inside the band, as long as the entire bandwidth of the signal is within the band allowed by law.  (Activity inside a ham band is often segregated by frequency according to voluntary ""gentlemen's agreements"" to reduce interference.)</p>

"How to calculate Return loss of cascaded system?","796","","<p>If system 1 has 10 dB return loss and system 2 has 20 dB return loss then what is the overall return loss of cascaded system of 1&amp;2 ?  </p>
","<p>Some time as passed since the original posting and I suppose the student has lost interest in this problem. But for the sake of completeness, I offer the following.</p>

<p>It must be said (as other commentators mentioned) that the problem as stated lacks sufficient information to give an exact result. Given more scattering parameters of each system, a conversion to T parameters to facilitate multiplying and then converting back to S parameters could be utilized. When only the combined S11 result is desired, this conversion process can deploy shortcuts to save on conversions.</p>

<p>Given the lack of required information , a statistical approach to the problem will yield the best available estimate. If we assume that the two stated Return Losses are unrelated, then applying RSS (Root of Sum of Squares) will yield a reasonable estimate (this is sometimes called ""addition in quadrature"").</p>

<p>First convert the RL figures to their respective reflection coefficient (Γ) or S11 scattering parameter:</p>

<p>$$ \Gamma_1 = 10^{10/-20} = 0.3162 $$</p>

<p>$$ \Gamma_2 = 10^{20/-20} = 0.1 $$</p>

<p>Then compute the RSS:</p>

<p>$$ \text{RSS} = \sqrt{\Gamma_1^2 + \Gamma_2^2} = 0.3316 $$</p>

<p>And finally, convert the RSS back to a combined RL:</p>

<p>$$ \text{RL} = -20 \log(0.3316) = 9.6 $$</p>

<p>It must again be stated that this results in a statistical estimate. If in fact there is significant gain, attenuation, or impedance transformation in these systems, this result could be substantially in error. In such a case, the order of the cascading could also have an effect on the results. But given the lack of information, it serves as a reasonable first order estimate. Meanwhile, I hope the good professor has removed or appropriately amended the question for future test pools.</p>

<p>It should be noted that this method can be used successfully when attempting to account for distributed reflections from connectors, etc. subject to the limitations noted above.</p>

"Why did I lose my FM radio signal?","793","","<p>My lady and I were driving on the interstate recently when we noticed an unusual phenomenon. We were listening to the radio (an FM signal), and only over a couple of bridges did we entirely lose our signal. I had some ideas explaining this but I'm not sure, so I am asking for your help. What caused this?</p>

<p>To clear things up a bit:</p>

<ul>
<li>It happened over three bridges in a thirty mile stretch. Each was over a river (not sure if that matters for reasons of over-water architecture or aquatic radio effects), but we crossed several other bridges that did not cause this phenomenon.</li>
<li>Our signal was excellent the whole drive except on these few bridges, when it suddenly disappeared (white noise) and reappeared immediately after crossing.</li>
<li>The bridges were concrete with no supports from above, no street lights, etc. There was no difference in obstructions above the vehicle for the entire drive.</li>
<li>I have spent a lot of time driving with the radio on and have never experienced such a loss of signal with no explainable obstruction. I can only assume that the construction of these few bridges is unique.</li>
</ul>
","<p>The likely source of this problem is not that the FM signal went away, but that it was overwhelmed by a local interference (RFI) source.  Certain electrical systems, like high-intensity lighting, can generate a lot of ""white noise"" in the VHF range, including the FM broadcast band.  It is quite possible that the bridges' lighting system (or some other electrical system) was active when you drove over.</p>

<p>You did not say what time of day was involved.  You might notice whether the lights were on.  The RFI problem would be worse for weaker FM signals.  You might try tuning in other, more local (stronger) FM stations to see if they can get through the radio noise.</p>

<p>Is there a simple “rule of thumb” method that I could use that requires little equipment?</p>
","<p>The canonical solution to this problem is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilkinson_power_divider"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wilkinson power divider</a>. There are of course other <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_dividers_and_directional_couplers#Power_dividers"" rel=""noreferrer"">power dividers</a>, but the Wilkinson is easy to fabricate, provides good isolation between the output ports, and is lossless when the output ports are equal and in phase, which is true for an ideal antenna array.</p>

<p>If you were to make one of these yourself, you'd probably do it with coax. However, it's easier to illustrate with microstrip:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HEV8z.png"" alt=""microstrip power divider""></p>

<p>P1 would be connected to your transmitter, and P2 and P3 to your antennas. </p>

<p>Between P1 and P2, and also between P1 and P3, are quarter-wavelength transmission lines having an impedance of $\sqrt 2 \cdot Z_0$. For your case that works out to $\sqrt 2 \cdot 50 \Omega = 70.7\Omega $. 75 ohm coax is close enough and easier to find.</p>

<p>Between P2 and P3 is a resistor that's twice the characteristic impedance. For your case, that's $100\Omega$.</p>

"Why isn't twisted pair used for feedlines?","764","","<p>My son was asking about some Ethernet cable (Cat 5 unshielded twisted pair), and since he recently passed his Technician exam and we both have ""radio stuff"" on our minds, I tried to make the analogy between coax transmission lines and the balanced pairs in the wire. I understand they both are used as RF transmission lines, essentially.</p>

<p>This got me thinking: why don't we use twisted pair for antenna feedlines? </p>

<p>As question T9B03 on the FCC exam covers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why is coaxial cable used more often than any other feedline for amateur radio antenna systems?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The correct answer being ""It is easy to use and requires few special installation considerations"" and <strong>not</strong> that ""It has less loss than any other type of feedline"" — the latter advantage going to balanced line, which is low-loss but does require special considerations particularly to avoid coupling to nearby metallic objects.</p>

<p>Would twisted pair offer something of best of both worlds? Could it provide lower loss than coax, and still without ""special installation considerations""? (Looks like Category 5 cable specifically has a 100ohm characteristic impedance, but that seems easily enough dealt with since you'd need a unbalanced-to-balanced transformer off of most ham equipment anyway, right?)</p>
","<p>Balanced lines (of which twisted pair is a special type) really have an upper frequency limit; you can't use them to transport 1 GHz (well, you can, but the smallest variation in direction or distance would have catastrophic effects, and the conductor distance would get <em>pretty small</em>).</p>

<p>This can be seen in technical practice: 100 Mbit/s Ethernet (Fast Ethernet) and 1 Gigabit/s ethernet both work with twisted pair, their baudrate being 125 MBaud – and hence, most of their signal energy is contained below ~250 MHz. For higher-rate digital busses, twisted pair, as nice and cheap it is, doesn't do well enough anymore – the typical ""cheap"" (as in: 16€/m) direct attach copper for the next faster 10GE (10GBase-CR) uses Twinax - which is exactly that, a balanced line within a shielded, well-specified dielectric (same goes for SATA 6b/s, where this picture is from):</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qmOKt.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qmOKt.jpg"" alt=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_ATA#/media/File:SATA3-TwinAxCable.jpg""></a></p>

<p>That way, up to 3.125 Gigabaud are possible. So yeah, for digital baseband, balanced line is used up to the multiples of GHz, but it's not cheaper than coax – in fact, it's the noise immunity considerations of differential signaling that led to the usage of twinax instead of simple coax. For an antenna, simple coax would have the same effect.</p>

<p>On the other hand, whenever you see a PCB transport RF signals, you'll find something like a microstrip line, a buried microstrip line, or a pair of differential lines – there you are, balanced lines again. On PCB, this gets easier (and necessary, as there's no chance to build true coax on a PCB), because the dielectric (the PCB substrate) is so mechanically and electrically reliable, and powers typically are limited.</p>

<p>For higher frequencies, losses due to radiation simply take the upper hand in free-swinging balanced line – and coax, with its losses in the dielectric, becomes the better line. If you go for the really high frequencies, or rather the really high powers, you typically drop the (inner) conductor altogether – and use a wave guide.</p>

<p>If you are making a mobile installation, then you don't have a lot of space, and you must necessarily make some compromises. However much space you have, make it that big.</p>

<p>If you must have a rule of thumb, a quarter wavelength is good. By this point you have most of the possible performance. If you want to be obsessive, you can go out to 1.5 wavelengths, which is typical of commercial AM broadcast stations.</p>

<p>Quarter-wave radials are also resonant (provided you don't bury them, or otherwise detune them), which assures that the radials have a low impedance. A low impedance is necessary for the ground plane to function as an effective counterpoise. Resonance is by no means necessary, however. Whatever impedance the radials have, it is halved each time the number of radials is doubled, so it ends up low anyway if you have many radials. If you don't have radials but instead a solid plane, this is equivalent to a very high number of radials so impedance will be low unless it is very tiny.</p>

Each half connects to opposite plates of the capacitor, and those plates are separated by an insulator. Yet, if you flip that switch repeatedly, the LED will blink. Clearly there's some current flowing.</p>

<p>If we pull the plates of the capacitor apart, it's still a capacitor. It capacitance will decrease, but it's still a capacitor. Just a smaller one.</p>

<p>If we squish the plates into long, thin tubes or wires, it's still a capacitor. Capacitance may decrease still more due to the smaller area of the plates, but it's still a capacitor. The circuit now is looking something like this:</p>

<p>Yep, it's a dipole antenna. Lose the LED and the resistor, and flip the switch a few million times per second, and you have a transmitter.</p>

<p>Not illustrated here is also the inductance of the antenna. All circuits have inductance, which you can realize if you follow a similar argument but with an inductor instead of a capacitor, and start straightening the coil into a straight line. The inductance decreases, but it never goes away. Usually we don't draw the inductance because it's small enough to be negligible in a simple circuit that blinks an LED. </p>

<p>Thus, antennas have capacitance and inductance. They also have resistive losses (unless they are made of superconductors) and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_resistance"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">radiation resistance</a>.

"Low Audio out from Kenwood TM-V71A on cross band repeat","727","","<p>Asking this for a web challenged friend:</p>

<p>He lives in an HOA restricted townhouse, so no external antennas.  He only does VHF FM, so it's not a big deal.  To participate in the local nets he uses his Kenwood TM-V71A in his car to crossband repeat from a HT in his house.  All works as it should if the HT is set to low power (1W).  If he runs it at 5W, the audio out of the Kenwood is clear, but low.  </p>

<p>He thinks this is the HT's doing, but I am not so sure. Could this be the Kenwood clamping the signal somehow?  He's inside a house, true, but it's a crappy plastic house :) and he's no more than 50' away from the car/radio at any given time.</p>
","<p>The transmitted audio on the TM-V71A appears to come out of the box setup for particularly sensitive microphones.  It can be adjusted, but only using programming software, it's not available via front panel menus:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From the open prgoram</p>

  <p>In the <em>Transmit/Receive</em> dialogue box, change the microphone sensitivity to the desired setting. (High/Medium/Low).</p>
  
  <p>CLOSE the dialogue box and WRITE back to the Xcvr.</p>
  
  <p>My radio arrived with the setting at the medium level. Some stations said that my audio levels were ""clean but low"". I hung the rig across a scope and the deviation read +3.8khz and -4.0khz (in the Medium senstivity setting and extreme close talking of the mic). Once the setting was changed to high, the deviation swing was in excess of 4khz both ways and ""louder"". Since then the reports have been normal. ""Sounds fine"".</p>

<p>While this is primarily intended to deal with microphone sensitivity differences, during crossband repeat the audio is fully demodulated, then passed through the same amplifiers prior to modulation as the microphone audio goes through.</p>

<p>This should resolve your low audio issues, but if it doesn't you'll probably have to look at the FM deviation to find out whether it's the HT, the mobile, or an issue with the crossband repeat function.</p>

","<p>No. You likely would need to build two new transmit stages and rewrite the firmware. Each transmit stage uses a precise final oscillator and mixer which is specific to the frequency band as well as a filter to suppress harmonics, use of the hardware for 70cm at a 33cm frequency would result in most of your transmit signal being filtered out - if it was even possible.</p>

<p>There are quad-band transmitters - yaesu makes a few - I am not aware of any with 33cm coverage, however. This would likely be a simple mod in a desk unit, but any modification of this sort of a handheld or even mobile radio is extremely difficult due to the fact that so many functions are concealed inside multi-purpose chips, many signals are inaccessible due to multi-layer PCBs and components without exposed leads, and there is simply no room inside the case for any add-on boards that we could manufacture.</p>

<p>If two ends of dipole antenna are pointing to the same direction. Will the signal be cancalled?</p>
","<p>From an antenna theory perspective, <strong>if you've bent the wire it isn't a dipole antenna any more.</strong> You've changed the shape of the antenna away from a dipole, so it will have a different radiation pattern than a dipole. The exact results will depend on what specifically you did.</p>

<p>However, the results will not be “the antenna no longer works”. <strong>It will just be different,</strong> and <em>somewhat</em> less efficient — as is <strong>any</strong> antenna folded or coiled to fit in a smaller space. But you'll also have pattern changes and losses from putting the antenna indoors — all structures interact with radio waves somewhat, even if they contain no metal.</p>

<p>(You can use antenna modeling software to see the results of using a particular shape, but this does not account for the characteristics of the surrounding walls and ceiling.)</p>

<p>Practically, don't worry too much about the antenna shape, just spread it out as much as you can. <strong>Bending an antenna to fit inside an apartment is a very common thing to do.</strong> Remember that the antenna will have a different impedance than an ordinary dipole of the same length, so don't use a pre-designed antenna and expect it to work as intended this way; expect to need to tune it (by trimming the ends, or using an antenna tuner or custom matching network).</p>

<p>Also consider, instead of a dipole, a wire loop around the entire perimeter of your ceiling — on the principle that this is the biggest antenna you can put up in your space.</p>

"Why do I only hear broadcasts from 150 kHz to 29.999 MHz?","702","","<p>I am currently studying for my amateur radio license. Until I'm licensed, I'm trying to use a Sony ICF-SW7600GR receiver to listen in on amateur radio ""phone"" transmissions. No matter what I do, however, I can't seem to locate any amateur radio conversations. Everything I manage to tune into is a broadcast, usually some news, music, or religious broadcasts. Since this receiver covers all MF and HF amateur bands, I really expected to pick up something. I've dialed directly into frequencies set aside for ""phone"" in Region 1 (I'm in Prague, Czech Republic), searched LSB under 10 MHz, USB above 10 MHz, normal AM, utilized the external SW antenna, dialed in directly to local stations, tried with and without synchronous detection, etc.</p>

<p>Maybe everyone is using FM or PM while my receiver only picks up AM? </p>
","<p>It doesn't sound like you're doing anything wrong. Most likely, you are simply only hearing strong stations; broadcasters put much more power into their transmissions than amateurs are legally allowed to, so you can hear them over a much wider range.</p>

<p>Advice on the practice of listening:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>For finding signals, first of all, <strong>always use SSB</strong>. Even if it's the wrong mode to demodulate the signal correctly, you will hear <em>something</em> (often including a strong carrier tone), because SSB is just turning a slice of the RF spectrum into audio regardless of what it contains. The only way you can miss hearing a signal using SSB is if the signal is much wider bandwidth than 3 kHz (so that it sounds like just an increase in the noise floor). Once you have found something, you can try other modes to receive it correctly.</p></li>
<li><p>Try tuning to the CW band segments (using a CW mode if you have it, otherwise SSB), rather than phone. Even if you don't know Morse code, CW signals are much easier to pick out of the noise by ear, so you can tell whether you're receiving anything.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure you're listening at the right time. Broadly speaking, propagation is better at night, so not only will you receive better, but more people will be transmitting. You should be able to hear the broadcasters more clearly as well. When you're studying for your license, read about the ionosphere and other kinds of propagation effects, and figure out when you should be listening to what band.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Advice on improving your reception:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You may have local noise sources which interfere with reception. They won't necessarily sound like anything other than the usual hiss of noise. Shut off all the electrical devices in your home temporarily and see whether they make a difference. (Instead of listening for signals you can't hear yet, listen for how clear the broadcasters are.) Or, especially if you're in an apartment building with many close neighbors, you could try going out to a park or other location with very little electronics.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure you have a decent antenna. Since you are receiving, not transmitting, this is not critical, but it helps. According to some reviews, your model of radio comes with a reel of wire in addition to the telescoping antenna; use it. There are two basic approaches:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>“Long wire”: Make your antenna wire as long as you can reasonably fit in the space you have. (Keep it away from large metal objects.)</p></li>
<li><p>Make it resonant on the band of interest. In particular, make it about 1/4 wavelength long, or possibly an odd multiple (3/4, 5/4, and so on). (Coiling up the free end will make it effectively shorter without needing to cut the wire.)</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Maybe everyone is using FM or PM while my receiver only picks up AM?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nobody uses FM on HF, because it is a waste of bandwidth. But if they did, then you could still hear it. Specifically:</p>

<ul>
<li>An AM receiver tuned exactly on a FM signal will produce silence (<em>not</em> noise).</li>
<li>An AM receiver tuned slightly off the FM signal will produce decent audio, with excess noise.</li>
<li>A SSB receiver tuned to an FM signal will produce a distorted sound which will still be recognizable as being voice-like (due to the timing of speech sounds), and possibly a tone from the carrier.</li>

"Antenna for a cramped attic","687","","<p>Brand new Ham. I bought a cheapo UV5 right before I got my call sign. I want to set up a decent 2m/70cm station for starters and I realize that a better radio is important but wanted to knock out the antenna situation first.</p>

<p>I live in HOA hell so no outdoor antennas, and to make matters worse, I am working with a 60 foot length / 36-40 inch height attic space. The good thing is my room/ham shack sits below the largest part of the house so I would only be looking at a — at most — 30 foot run to the antenna.</p>

<p>Any recommendations on DIY or for purchase antennas would be much appreciated. Any recommendations on type of cable to run (RG8/RG8x/LMR-400)? I'm  looking for really good results to get started without a huge investment — I may be dreaming on this one.</p>
","<p>Your attic is pretty low but not quite low enough to be a problem for installing a vertically polarized 144 MHz antenna. There are two common antenna designs that would suit your case:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Ground plane antenna.</p>

<p>This simply consists of a vertical quarter-wavelength element (stiff wire or rod) sticking up from a horizontal ground plane (sheet metal, as big as you can make it). You can either make it entirely from scratch, or get an antenna intended for vehicles (magnet or through-hole mount) and supply your own sheet metal surface (if you don't have metal supply handy, buy a steel cookie sheet).</p></li>
<li><p>Vertical dipole antenna.</p>

<p>This consists of two quarter-wavelength elements, one above the other, fed from the center. Your roof is <em>just</em> high enough that you'll be able to fit one in in the full height.</p>

<p>The most straightforward way to feed a vertical dipole is to run coax <em>horizontally</em> to the center (feed point); the coax must not just dangle next to the lower element. Alternatively, you can <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/questions/644/handheld-dipoles/1941#1941"">run the feed line inside the antenna, coaxially</a>.</p>

<p>A vertical dipole is an uncommon antenna because it's taller than most and because it either requires a sideways bit sticking out or more complex construction. You'll probably have to make it from scratch, but that's easier since (for the horizontal feed) all you need is plain wire and a way to support the ends and join to the coax in the center.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Ideally, your antenna would be cut to exactly the right length to present a 50 Ω impedance (1:1 SWR) to the radio, but HTs are built to deal with compromise antennas (short ‘rubber duckies’), so it'll work fine, just not quite as efficiently. But if you know a friend with an antenna analyzer, have them bring it over to test while you trim the antenna to length.</p>

<hr>

<p>In either case, if you are planning higher-power operation, or in general for best results, you should install a <em>choke balun</em> at the feed-point (except for the coaxial vertical dipole which does not need one). This ensures that the part of your system which actually radiates/receives is the part in the attic, not the rest of the cable.</p>

<p>The simplest possible design is simply taking some extra length of cable in your feed line and coiling it into a tight neat helix (use a piece of plastic pipe as a form) as if you were making an inductor. Don't bend coaxial cable too tightly — check the specifications!</p>

<hr>

<p>Finally, for your choice of coaxial cable: look up its specifications, find the loss (given in dB per some length at a particular frequency), multiply that by the length you'll be using (check your units!), and decide if that loss is acceptable.</p>

<p>For example, if you paid the price to install some LMR-400 which specifies loss as 1.5 dB/100 ft at 150 MHz, and your run is 30 feet long, then your actual loss is:</p>

<p>$$
\frac{1.5\,\mathrm{dB}}{100\,\mathrm{ft}} \cdot 30\,\mathrm{ft} = 0.45\,\mathrm{dB}

<p>And to convert that to a power ratio we calculate $10^{-0.45/10} = 0.902$. So however much power your transmitter puts out, you're losing a tenth of it in the coax. That's quite good. If you use lesser coax, you'll have worse results, but even, say, a 3 dB loss is not really a big deal.</p>

<p>""#"" isn't the only symbol in common computer use which is not defined in Morse code. For example, Morse code can't distinguish upper and lower case letters. Nor does it have codes for any of <code>{*^&amp;_</code>. The reason is likely that Morse code is intended to be memorized and decoded by a human, and each additional code makes that harder. How much harder would it be if instead of the 26 basic letters, a little punctuation and a few prosigns, you had to learn 128 codes for the entire basic ASCII character set? Or, 113,021 codes to cover all of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode#Versions"">Unicode 7</a>?</p>

<p>Let's also not forget that Morse code predates ASCII by about 130 years and its intended application is sending telegrams.</p>

<p>Of course there are modern encodings which are more similar to modern computer technology. For example, PSK31 can encode all 127 characters of basic ASCII.

"""Coaxial capacitors in line” in E4E04?","683","","<p>I've been studying the U.S. license examination question pools. For the most part, it is reasonably obvious what the questions and answers mean even when I am not yet able to come up with the answers on my own. However, the correct answer to this question in the Extra class pool is confusing me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>E4E04 (D)<br>
  How can conducted and radiated noise caused by an automobile alternator be suppressed?  </p>
  
  <p>A. By installing filter capacitors in series with the DC power lead and by installing a blocking capacitor in the field lead<br>

<p>What is the purpose of specifying “coaxial” capacitors? Why does it say “in line”, which in the absence of further information I would interpret as “in series”? I would think that low-pass rather than high-pass filtering would be desirable.</p>

<p>Thus, the two leads are effectively a wire, ideally having zero impedance between them. However, this conductor also has some capacitance to the case, which is usually connected to ground. This particular part is designed to be dropped in a hole the size of the case, then soldered in place. Another design has a tab on the case for screw mounting.</p>

<p>The advantage of this arrangement is that it's possible to use as a filter on some wire with high $\mathrm{d}v/\mathrm{d}t$ without creating a stub which could also act as an EMI radiator. It's also possible to preserve the continuity of a shield or enclosure, and get a really good connection to it. With an ordinary capacitor, the ground connection would go through a lead, which would have more inductance and resistance, reducing the filter effectiveness.</p>

<p>There's a similar looking, but different thing: <em>axial</em>-leaded capacitors. These are frequently electrolytic. Example:</p>

"Is transmission wattage calculated using RMS?","668","","<p>I understand (and correct me if I'm wrong) that transmission power follows Ohm's law ($I = \frac{V}{R}$), that is that if I have a 50 Ω antenna that I know is transmitting at 1 W, then the current is:</p>

<p>$$
V = IR\\
P = VI \\
P = (IR)R = I^2R\\
\frac{P}{R} = I^2\\
I = \sqrt{\frac{P}{R}}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{50}}=0.141\\
I = 0.141\,\mathrm{A}
$$</p>

<p>Then the voltage is</p>

<p>$$
V=IR=0.141\,\mathrm{A} \cdot 50\,\Omega=7.07\,\mathrm{A}\\
V=7.07\,\mathrm{A}
$$</p>

<p><strong>Is that voltage RMS, peak to peak, or something else?</strong></p>

<p>If it's RMS, then peak to peak voltage is: </p>

<p>$$
V_{\text{PEAK}}=V_{\text{RMS}}\cdot\sqrt{2}=
7.07\cdot\sqrt{2}=7.07\cdot1.414=10\\
V_{\text{PEAK}}=10\,\mathrm{V}\\
V_{PP} = V_{PEAK}\cdot2=10\cdot2=20\,\mathrm{V}
$$</p>

<p><strong>Am I correct in saying that I need a 20V peak to peak sinewave signal to generate 1W RF output on the 50Ω antenna?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Is the maximum current I need to design for in my final amplifier 141 mA, or do I need to use $V_{\text{PP}}$ to calculate the maximum current? ($I=\frac{V}{R}=\frac{20\,\mathrm{V}}{50\,\Omega}=0.400\,\mathrm{A}$)</strong></p>
","<p>The AC voltage and current you get from P=IE or Ohm's law in AC circuits are <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_mean_square"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RMS</a> values. I'll explain why.</p>

<p>If you have a constant voltage into a resistor, the power is $P=E^2/R$. That is, power is proportional to the <em>square</em> of voltage. The same is true for a constant current through a resistor: $P=I^2R$. Either of these equations can be derived by by substituting some arrangement of Ohm's law into $P=IE$.</p>

<p>Now say you have AC into a resistor. If you want to calculate the power, you can measure the voltage and current at each instant, multiply them together to get power, then average all these instants together to get the mean power.</p>

<p>What if you measure just the voltage? Assuming a resistive load, you can still calculate power from voltage measured at some instant by $P=E^2/R$. However, if you simply take the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">arithmetic mean</a> of the voltages at each instant, then try to calculate power with that average, you miss an important fact: doubling the voltage <em>quadruples</em> the power. RMS is simply a way of averaging voltage that doesn't miss that.</p>

<p>We can make a simplified example. Let's just consider three instants at which we measured voltage and current into a 50 ohm load:</p>

<pre><code>voltage  current  power
1V       0.02A    0.02W
2V       0.04A    0.08W
3V       0.06A    0.18W
</code></pre>

<p>At each of these instants, $P=IE$ and $E/I = 50 \Omega$. Let's calculate some different kinds of averages:</p>

<p>$$ \begin{align}
P_{mean} &amp;= \frac{0.02 + 0.08 + 0.18}{3} &amp;\approx 0.0933\mathrm{W} \\
V_{mean} &amp;= \frac{1+2+3}{3} &amp;= 2\mathrm{V} \\
V_{RMS} &amp;= \sqrt{\frac{1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2}{3}} &amp;\approx 2.16\mathrm{V} \\
I_{mean} &amp;= \frac{0.02 + 0.04 + 0.06}{3} &amp;= 0.04\mathrm{A} \\
I_{RMS} &amp;= \sqrt{\frac{0.02^2 + 0.04^2 + 0.06^2}{3}} &amp;\approx 0.0432\mathrm{A} \\
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>Now then, for which of these does $P=IE$ hold?</p>

<p>$$ \begin{align}
V_{mean} I_{mean} &amp;= 2\mathrm{V} \cdot 0.04\mathrm{A} &amp;= 0.08\mathrm{W} &amp;\text{   wrong!} \\
V_{RMS} I_{RMS} &amp;= 2.16\mathrm{V} \cdot 0.0432\mathrm{A} &amp;= 0.0933\mathrm{W} &amp;\text{   correct!}
\end{align} $$</p>

<p>You are right that if you want to know the peak current your amplifier will need to supply, you need to convert this RMS value to something else. However, you got it backwards: $V_p = \sqrt{2} V_{RMS}$. So for the example above, your amplifier would be required to supply $\sqrt{2} \cdot 2.16\mathrm{V} = 3.05\mathrm{V}$ peak. Being AC, it would have to supply up to +3.05V and also down to -3.05V. Thus, the <em>peak to peak</em> amplitude is 6.10V.</p>

<p>Same math applies to current.</p>

<p>Note that this math of converting between peak and RMS values with $\sqrt{2}$ only applies to <em>sine waves</em>, which our example wasn't, so there was some wrongness there. However in radio, our transmissions are close enough to sine waves that assuming they are is usually a good enough approximation.</p>

<p>Note also that being able to RMS averages in equations like $P=IE$ or $P=I^2R$ only works for <em>resistive</em> loads. It works for <em>reactive</em> loads if what you care about is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_power#Real.2C_reactive.2C_and_apparent_power"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">apparent power and not real power</a>, and it <a href=""https://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/97904/17608"">doesn't work at all for <em>non-linear</em> loads</a>.</p>

<p>Here's the problem: the solder joint you might make between two transmission lines won't have a 50Ω characteristic impedance.

"How does power received by a dipole relate to electric field intensity?","661","","<p>Let's say there's a transmitter far away, and I'm going to receive the transmitted signal. To keep things simple let's further say the transmitted signal is a pure, unmodulated sine wave. Further, let's say the electric field generated by that distant transmitter, at the point where my receive antenna is to be installed, has an intensity of 1 mV/m.</p>

<p>Assuming that I can now install an ideal, lossless dipole, how much power would be received by this dipole? How does the received power vary with length, ie a half-wave dipole versus a shorter dipole?</p>
","<p>There are a lot of ways to approach this problem, but here's one: we can calculate the power density of that field, and determine the area from which the antenna captures power, and multiply them together.</p>

<h1>Calculating the power density</h1>

<p>If we know the electric field to be 1 mV/m, and the transmitting antenna is distant, then the magnetic field must be related by the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impedance_of_free_space"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">impedance of free space</a>: $376.7\:\Omega$. So, the magnetic field must be:</p>

<p>$$ {1\:\mathrm{mV} \over \mathrm m }
\cdot {1 \over 376.7\:\Omega}
= {2.655\:\mathrm{\mu A} \over \mathrm m } $$</p>

<p>Multiplying these two together, we can calculate the power density:</p>

<p>$$ {1\:\mathrm{mV} \over \mathrm m }
\cdot {2.655\:\mathrm{\mu A} \over \mathrm m }
= {2.655\:\mathrm{nW} \over \mathrm m^2 } $$</p>

<p>In other words, there is 2.655 nW passing through an area of a square meter perpendicular to the transmitting antenna. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poynting%27s_theorem"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Poynting's theorem</a> is the formal basis for this calculation, but since we know we are dealing with a radiated field (in the far-field of the transmitting antenna), we know the electric and magnetic fields are in phase and so we can simplify the calculations substantially.</p>

<h1>Calculating the effective aperture</h1>

<p>Now that we know the power density, we just need to know the area from which the dipole will collect power. We'll have to approach this part of the problem backwards.</p>

<p>We know that the free-space gain of a dipole is 2.15 dBi or 1.64. The area from which an antenna collects energy is called <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/q/3643/218"">effective aperture</a> ($A_\mathrm{eff}$), and it has a simple relation to gain (G):</p>

<p>$$ A_\mathrm{eff} = {G \lambda^2 \over 4 \pi} $$</p>

<p>So if we set $G = 1.64$ we get the effective aperture of a free-space half-wave dipole:</p>

<p>$$ {1.64 \lambda^2 \over 4 \pi } = 0.1305\:\mathrm m^2 $$</p>

<p>So, a dipole half a meter long ($\lambda = 1\:\mathrm m$) collects power from an area of $0.1305\:\mathrm{m^2}$. With decreasing frequency the half-wave dipole gets bigger, and consequently collects more power.</p>

<p>So to know the power we'd see at the antenna terminals, we just multiply these two numbers together:</p>

<p>$$ {2.655\:\mathrm{nW} \over \mathrm m^2 }
\cdot 0.1305\:\mathrm{m^2}
= 346.4\:\mathrm{pW} = -64.60\:\mathrm{dBm} $$</p>

<p>At this point, you may wonder why we use the <em>free-space</em> dipole gain. Don't dipoles over ground have more gain? And the reason is simple: the question specified that the electric field strength at the point where the receiving antenna was to be installed. Any constructive interference due to reflections from the ground would have already been taken into account by this measurement.</p>

<h1>Effective aperture of a shorter dipole</h1>

<p>Amazingly, it's almost the same as a half-wave dipole.</p>

<p>If you begin with an ideal half-wave dipole and then keep shortening it, the thing you are left with in the limiting case where the dipole is infinitesimally short is called a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipole_antenna#Hertzian_dipole"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hertzian dipole</a>. Amazingly, this infinitesimally short dipole has a free-space gain of 1.5 (where the half-wave dipole was 1.64). Thus, it collects power from a slightly smaller area, but not smaller by much.</p>

<p>How can this be, when we know practically that really small antennas don't work well? Well, as the antenna becomes smaller, the radiation resistance approaches zero. Thus, it becomes increasingly difficult to make an <a href=""http://www.antenna-theory.com/basics/gain.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">efficient antenna</a> with real materials since the resistance of the wire used to make the antenna becomes much larger relative to the radiation resistance.</p>

<h1>Putting it all together</h1>

<p>With a bit of algebra we can combine all of this into one equation:</p>

<p>$$ P_\mathrm{ant} = { E_E^2 \ G \lambda^2 \over 4\pi Z_0 }
\approx { E_E^2 \ G \lambda^2 \over 4734 } $$</p>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
<li>$P_\mathrm{ant}$ is the power at the antenna terminals,</li>
<li>$E_E$ is the electric field intensity ($\mathrm{V/m}$),</li>
<li>$G$ is the gain of the antenna (1.64 for a half-wave dipole),</li>
<li>$\lambda$ is the wavelength, and</li>
<li>$Z_0$ is the impedance of free space ($376.7\:\Omega$).</li>

<p>The <a href=""http://hamuniverse.com/hustlerbtvtrapcalibration.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tuning instructions</a> for this antenna advise the installer to move the sleeve up or down relative to the coil it covers, rather than adjusting the length of the intermediate elements. What's the electrical explanation for why this effects a change in resonant frequency?</p>
","<p>The trap is an LC parallel circuit:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZDDnO.png"" alt=""capacitor and inductor in parallel""></p>

<p>At some frequency, the inductive and capacitive reactances are equal, and the trap looks like a very high impedance. No significant current can flow through this impedance, and the rest of the antenna is effectively disconnected.</p>

<p>When the sleeve is adjusted up, more of it overlaps the top section of the trap, increasing the capacitance. Now the trap isn't precisely resonant, and starts to look more like a series capacitor. This electrically lengthens the antenna, effectively making the rest of the antenna a capacitive hat, making it resonate at a lower frequency.</p>

<p>Adjusting the sleeve down has the opposite effect: it reduces capacitance and now the trap looks more like a series inductor. This is not like a loading coil: adding series inductance at the <em>top</em> electrically shortens the antenna, making it resonate at a higher frequency. This is not something you ordinarily see since people usually want to make a small antenna work as a bigger one, not the other way around.</p>

<p>With these kinds of adjustments, you can get a very large change in resonant frequency without moving the trap very far, but it's not without disadvantages. Since current is no longer flowing in a quarter-wave section, it won't behave like a quarter-wave antenna. The feedpoint impedance and radiation pattern will be different. There are most likely higher losses as well, since currents are flowing through more metal, increasing resistive losses. The magnitude of these problems is proportional to the distance from resonance the trap has been adjusted.</p>

I also rotate the antenna for different polarizations. The times that I do get a few seconds of signal, it may end up being from the totally wrong direction than what the pass prediction said.</p>

It seems to me that SO-50 is the only operational FM voice repeater (aside from the ISS, which isn't always in voice mode, if I understand correctly).</p>

<p>EDIT: I had been adjusting for Doppler shift at first, but then left it at the centre frequency, as it did not seem to be making a difference. However, the chart provided by Pete NU9W was very helpful in making me realize the problem. I think my radio isn't sensitive enough to adjust for Doppler shift properly. It will only change the frequency by 25 kHz at a time, and the chart suggests adjusting by 5 kHz at a time. In my case, I can be 5 kHz off centre, or 30 kHz off in either direction. Since 30 kHz is too far off, it would explain why I only hear something in the middle of the pass.</p>

<p>EDIT 2: I figured out how to change the step frequency on my radio to 5 kHz instead of 25 kHz. I will try using this setting and see if I can adjust for Doppler shift better next time.</p>
","<p>It sounds like you're not adjusting for Doppler shift. Just like the sound of a car horn, which is higher pitched when the car is coming toward you than when it's going away, the signal from the satellite is at a higher frequency when it's coming toward you than when it's going away. When the satellite is close to the horizon at the start of the pass it's coming toward you, so the frequency you see is higher; at the end of the pass it's going away, so the frequency is lower. When it's overhead you see it at its actual frequency. You have to adjust for these frequency changes during the pass. <a href=""http://www.amsat.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Work_FM_Sats-20131010.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Here's a link</a> to a page with suggested frequencies (scroll down).</p>

"What makes a good emergency-capable QRP rig for travel?","648","","<p>It's wintertime, which drives the concept of emergency preparedness here above the 45th Parallel. Am emergency-capable QRP rig is an excellent item to stuff into one's Go Bag or vacation gear, always but especially now.</p>

<p>What's an essential minimum for a QRP HF rig suited for rural (no-repeater)?</p>
","<p>This is a huge area and personal preference is going to drive the choices to a great degree.  For a good answer some parameters need to be defined:</p>

<p><em><strong>Are you only going to operate the rig if you are in trouble?</em></strong></p>

<p>This defines the size/cost/weight of your choice.  If you are going to also operate “normally”, the rig can take up more of your space/weight budget.  If you intend to only operate in emergencies, then something small and light is probably best.</p>

<p><em><strong>What mode will you be using?</em></strong></p>

<p>CW, SSB, or both?</p>

<p><em><strong>Define travel.  Are you going to be on foot, horseback, dog sled, snowmobile or other motorized transport?</em></strong></p>

<p>Obviously this makes a huge impact in the weight and size categories.  Anything other than on foot realistically opens you up to just about any portable transceiver.  On foot, then something small with small (light) batteries is appropriate.  But the size there depends on how far you are going and if you will operate at other times than an emergency.</p>

<p><em><strong>Who would you be trying to reach: other preppers, State Troopers, Alaska National Guard SAR, USCG, Mom and Dad? How far away are these people and what are the conditions (propagation-wise, in general) you will face where you are going?</em></strong></p>

<p>This would define the capabilities needed in your rig. Your cute ¼W 40m CW only Tuna Tin II won’t do you much good for contacting the State Troopers, for example.</p>

<p>I don’t have a “go bag”, I live on the coastal plain between Baltimore and DC and there’s no hope to escape the region for a sudden event.  And if it’s not sudden, I have time to pack and being an organized individual, I could probably still get out of the house faster than many with prepared plans.  If I did live away from large cities with only 1 or 2 roads out of the area, my bag would look like this:</p>

<p>1)  My Android Smart phone with spare batteries. This has the usual assortment of apps loaded including a repeater listing app that only requires your GPS fix, not a connection to the network, to function.  Gives you bearing and range all repeaters in 25/50 miles depending on the setting.</p>

<p>2)  SPOT Personal Tracker -- 99USD MSRP.  This is a GPS / Satellite unit that you can use to check in as OK or to summon help.  Uses commercial satellites to route “911” calls to the nearest SAR outfit to your location.  They make larger units that also function as regular GPS devices. I wouldn’t hike outside of cell coverage without this or something similar, emergency conditions or not.</p>

<p>3)  Cheap Chinese 2m/440MHz HT.  I have a couple.  These are small, light and so cheap and useful, even if you have a nice HT, having a few of these around is handy and at $35 each they are some of the cheapest ham gear you could own.</p>

<p>4)  Small folding Yagi for 2m and/or 440MHz.  These weigh almost nothing when made from an old tape measure and take up no room.  With one of these, the Chinese HT and the repeater book off the phone, the chances of hitting a repeater just went up dramatically.</p>

<p>After that it would depend on answers to the above questions.  </p>

<p><em>For me</em> the answer is my FT-817.  It’s hard to beat the DC to daylight coverage including the 5MHz Alaska Emergency Frequency.  For casual use or emergency only use, the internal batteries are all you need.  I have the W4RT NiMH pack in mine and it lasts me for hours.  If I want more time, I have a pair of NiMH packs from RC planes that I have set up with power poles.  Together the 3 packs last me 15-20 hours.  It has an internal keyer, so add a set of travel paddles, a 20m dipole and a VHF/UHF dummy load, I mean rubber duckie and I am set.</p>

<p>I can use the dipole on 40m and 10m with acceptable SWR in a pinch.  If we are talking non-foot travel, then adding a tuner would be good.  Perhaps other antennas, my BuddiPole/MFJ vertical has given me contacts out to a couple thousand km at 5W.  the whole thing packs up to about 70cm long and 1-2kg.</p>

But outside of Europe and North America, I see that there are not many APRS digipeaters around. Let's say I want hike for days in Central Asia or the Himalayas. What options do I have? Is there some portable HF rig I can carry? When I'm in some deep narrow valleys, is there any hope of updating my location?</p>

<p>Any experience or suggestions will be helpful.</p>
","<p>So you want to broadcast your location using backpack-portable equipment from deep in a narrow valley hundreds of miles from civilization.  I'll assume that you would also like the ability to get a message out when necessary.  These are very demanding requirements.  I don't think that there is any inexpensive, 100% reliable way to do what you seem to want, but here are some alternatives to consider.</p>

<p><strong>Option: Morse code QRP (low-power) transceiver</strong></p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
<li>Radio, battery, and antenna can be under 1.5 lb / 0.75 kg</li>
<li>Radio can be inexpensive if you're willing to homebrew it</li>
<li>Simple equipment, therefore hopefully reliable</li>
<li>Can hold a conversation, rather than just delivering a simple message</li>
<li>Can normally communicate out to about 1000 miles / 1600 km with ease</li>
<li>No computer required</li>
<li>Very power-efficient</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Results depend on propagation to some extent</li>
<li>Morse code knowledge and QRP skill required</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Option: satellite phone</strong></p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
<li>Theoretically works from anywhere</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Expensive</li>
<li>Fragile equipment</li>
<li>Battery hog</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Option: PSK31 over HF</strong></p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
<li>No Morse code experience required</li>
<li>Easy propagation to about 1000 miles / 1600 km</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Results depend on propagation to some extent</li>
<li>Amateur radio skill required</li>
<li>Some sort of computer required; computer is fragile and battery-hungry</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Option: APRS via ISS</strong></p>

<p>I'm talking about APRS using the International Space Station's digipeater (or another satellite's). (<a href=""http://www.aprs.org/iss-faq.html"" rel=""nofollow"">more information</a>).</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
<li>Potentially send APRS messages from anywhere!</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Skill required</li>
<li>Need a fragile gain antenna</li>
<li>Need some sort of computer for satellite pass information and packet generation</li>
<li>Difficult for one person to aim the antenna at the satellite and operate the radio at the same time</li>
<li>Need to get a short packet out during a very brief satellite pass</li>
<li>Depends on a single digipeater in orbit, which may be hopelessly congested</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Option: Personal Locator Beacon (PLB)</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/personal-locator-beacons.html"" rel=""nofollow"">PLBs</a> are similar to EPIRBs used at sea: a simple, rugged commercially-made transmitter that is designed to transmit an urgent MAYDAY message.  When a PLB is activated, generally a Search And Rescue (SAR) team is called out.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reliable and rugged</li>
<li>Simple to use</li>
<li>No subscription required</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can't use it for routine updates</li>
<li>If a SAR team responds, the user may be liable for the cost of the rescue attempt</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Option: Satellite Messenger device</strong></p>

<p>A <a href=""https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/personal-locator-beacons.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Satellite Messenger</a> is a simple commercially-made device that allows the user to send text messages via the Iridium or Globalstar satellite network.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reliable and rugged</li>
<li>Simple to use</li>
<li>Can send regular non-emergency updates</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Subscription is required</li>
<li>The ""jury is still out"" on how well they work, according to the <a href=""https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/personal-locator-beacons.html"" rel=""nofollow"">REI article</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Other options</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>WSPR: I wouldn't choose this option, because there is no good way to send a MAYDAY / SOS</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.winlink.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Winlink</a>: I wouldn't choose this one either, because it requires a strong signal, which would require a big battery and larger antenna</li>
</ul>

<p>Personally, I would choose the QRP Morse code transceiver (with a PLB or a Satellite Messenger as a backup), but I already have experience with Morse code QRP.  This is a skill, which takes some time to learn, that would need to be acquired and practiced in civilization <em>before</em> you head out to the middle of nowhere.  But it's the method that uses the simplest equipment and the least power.  By the way, for any of these methods to work reliably you would need to hike out of the narrow, deep valley.</p>

"What is the proper way to ground your station's antenna?","641","","<p>I don't understand how you would go about giving an RF ground to your antenna. Would it not become an additional radial and affect the signal? </p>

<p>What is the proper way to ground your station's antenna?</p>
","<p>To answer your first question, yes, it will affect the signal, but it's a good thing.</p>

<p>What you do to (RF) ground your antenna(s) depends on what type of antenna you are using.  For instance, dipoles do not require a ground.  Typical vertical antennas do require a graound though some types such as the GAP Challenger use 3 wires insulated from ground (in this application they are referred to as a <em>counterpoise</em>).</p>

<p>In a typical vertical antenna installation, your radiator is λ/4 tall (electrically at least, it might be physically shorter through the use of coils or whatever).  This is referred to as a monopole and is half of a good antenna.  You make the ground be the other half of the antenna but creating a ground plane with radials.  This creates a virtual image antenna that completes the overall antenna effect.  These radials are usually buried just below the surface or stapled down to the ground and grass is allowed to grow through them to hold them down.</p>

<p>That's your RF ground.  In addition, it's usually desirable to have an electrical ground for lightning and static electricity protection.  This is achieved by making a lower impedence path to ground than you feedline presents.  Usually one or more 8' copper-clad rods are pounded into the ground at the base of the antenna and bound to it.  The area of effect of this is <em>below</em> the ground plane and doesn't detract from the signal.</p>

","<p>I can't comment from experience on other Yaesu transceivers, but the ""Digital"" mode on the <strong>Yaesu FT-857/897</strong> is basically a second SSB/CW mode. It exists in order to have a separate, configurable group of settings so that you don't have to change your regular settings away from those suitable for SSB phone use.</p>

<p>If I remember correctly, it includes the following separated settings (adjusted separately vs. other modes) or special settings (adjusted with “digital”-specific menu items):</p>

<ul>
<li>Upper vs. lower sideband</li>
<li>Offset between the displayed frequency and carrier frequency (SSB phone normally displays the carrier frequency; CW displays the center of the passband; the Digital mode lets you set an <em>arbitrary</em> offset.)</li>
<li>DSP filter passband edges</li>
<li>IF shift</li>
</ul>

<p>If another radio <em>has these settings,</em> then it can be configured the same way. The ""digital mode"" is merely a convenience to enable all those settings at once; it does not have any unique capabilities (other than the arbitrary frequency offset) and does not involve anything like a modem.</p>

"Improving VHF airband reception","634","","<p>I'm trying to receive VHF airband transmitted from a nearby airport via RTLSDR and having a hard time doing so. Obviously the stock antenna is useless in this situation. I tried building a quarter-wave ground plane antenna but that didn't improve reception much. Only overhead planes are heard well, controller is barely audible, and so is the ATIS frequency. Roof access is also a hard one, so I'm limited by what I can receive from my window.</p>

<p>What are the important factors when trying to improve VHF airband reception? What will get me the best reception without going crazy with expensive antennas/parts?</p>
","<p>Controllers and ATIS are transmitting from the ground, so they're always harder to receive because terrain, trees, and buildings are in the way. The best thing you can do to improve your reception is <strong>move your antenna as high off the ground as you can</strong>, to reduce the density of line-of-sight obstacles. If you can't put it on the roof, at least hang it from the ceiling for a minor improvement.</p>

<p>The best antenna for your purpose would be a <strong>“high-gain” vertical antenna</strong>. Such an antenna has a pattern which is more flattened — it has more gain in the horizontal plane at the cost of lesser gain at higher angles. Since your current system performance is unbalanced in the other direction, it should be an overall improvement.</p>

<hr>

<p>After setting up the best antenna you can, you want to improve your receiver's <em>signal-to-noise ratio</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>First, make sure you have <strong>set the hardware AGC <em>off</em></strong> (there should be a checkbox for this in whichever software you are using), because the RTL's AGC doesn't work well for these applications (it runs too high). Then find a good setting for the manual gain control (e.g. pick an ATIS station you can barely hear, and listen for the best audio).</p></li>
<li><p>Check for local broadband noise sources. Try turning off electrical equipment (including non-incandescent light bulbs!), and watch the spectrum to see if the noise floor (‘everywhere there isn't a signal’) reduces in intensity. Find out if there's a culprit you own and can replace or turn off when you want to listen. <strong>Try a different computer</strong> in case you have a particularly noisy computer.</p></li>
<li><p>If you find that there is no significant local noise — in particular, if the noise floor doesn't rise above the level you get with the gain turned all the way down or the antenna disconnected — then you are in the “lucky” position of having a good signal-to-noise ratio but weak signals. This means that you can benefit from <strong>a better receiver</strong> — in particular one with a higher ADC bit depth than the 8-bit RTL-SDR. This will appear as reducing the receiver's internal noise floor.</p></li>
<li><p>Alternatively to the previous option, or if you <em>do</em> have local noise but can move the <em>antenna</em> away from it, you can use a <strong>low-noise amplifier (LNA)</strong>. This is a device which is installed right at the antenna, and amplifies the signal at that point so that it is much stronger than the noise internal to the receiver (or leaking into the receiver from nearby equipment or out-of-band).</p></li>

<p>That is, if both antennas have VSWR = 1:1, then which one is more efficient? </p>

<p>Note: that the term 'efficiency' in above, does not mean the definition of antenna-efficiency. I know that antenna-efficiency is 100%, since there are ZERO ohmic loss and $\infty$ return-loss. So, from ""efficient"", I mean the effectiveness of the antenna in radiating energy in space.</p>
","<p>With the information you've provided, there is no way to tell. Feedpoint impedance and VSWR have no relationship to antenna efficiency. See <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/a/905/218"">What is the relationship between SWR and receive performance?</a></p>

<p>The feedpoint impedance also has no relationship to antenna efficiency. A ""50Ω antenna"" means the impedance <em>at the feedpoint</em> is 50Ω. The impedance at other points is probably something very different. In a dipole, for example, the impedance is about 72Ω at the feedpoint, and very much higher at the ends. This is why current is at a maximum at the feedpoint (low impedance), and at a minimum at the ends (high impedance).</p>

<p><em>Is there an advantage to an antenna with a feedpoint impedance equal to the impedance of free space?</em> No. An antenna of any design transforms between the impedance of free space to its feedpoint impedance. An antenna can be designed to work at any feedpoint impedance. The losses come from things like resistance in the antenna wire and coils, and dielectric losses in tuning capacitors. To the extent that you don't have these things, an antenna can be efficient. A dipole, vertical, loop, or any other kind of antenna constructed from ideal materials is already 100% efficient.</p>

<p>This can easily be seen by considering the law of conservation of energy. If your antenna isn't getting hot, yet you are putting 100W of power into it, only two things can happen to that energy. It can be be:</p>

<ol>
<li>stored in reactance of the antenna</li>
<li>radiated away</li>
</ol>

<p>If the antenna has a purely resistive impedance, then there is no reactance to be storing energy, so it must be radiating away. The feedpoint impedance is irrelevant.</p>

"How to keep a disconnected coaxial connector weatherproof?","626","","<p>The advice I have seen on lightning safety is that if you don't have high-quality lightning protection (and associated grounding) installed on your feed line, it is advisable to, during a storm and preferably whenever you are not using your station, is to disconnect the antenna feed line from your equipment and <strong>“throw it out the window”</strong>, to separate it from the interior of the house.</p>

<p>This seems like a perfectly reasonable idea to me, except for the fact that “out the window” is likely to be wet, especially under the circumstances. <strong>How can I protect the free end of the coaxial cable (a PL-259 connector in this case) from water and other environmental damage?</strong> Permanent connections can be wrapped with amalgamating tape, but this is temporary and recurring.</p>

<p>It is possible I could arrange to hang the cable right under the eaves of the roof so as to avoid actual rain, but it would still be exposed to damp, windblown crud, bugs, and so on. I do have a rubber dust-cap the cable came with but it doesn't fully enclose the connector — would that be sufficient, assuming there isn't actually rain running down the cable?</p>

<p>Or alternatively, what <strong>other approaches</strong> should I consider for the safety of myself and my equipment, besides the above two? Note I am in a rented space and all of my current equipment is specifically installed “temporarily”. (Taking down the antenna itself is quite easy and I would probably do it in the event of a predicted storm, but even then the feed line is still a conductor outside of the building, and partly on the roof.)</p>
","<p>I'd recommend one of two solutions:</p>

<h3>1. Don't throw it out the window.</h3>

<p>Most lightning damage comes not from direct strikes but nearby strikes, which can still induce large-ish voltages on the feedline: not enough to make lightning, but enough to damage things. A couple feet of air between the feedline and the tranciever will protect against this. If you do get a direct strike, you will probably have a lot of problems, feedline out the window, or not. Sure, you are taking an additional risk, but it's a small one, and maybe acceptable. Unless you have a very large tower, it's probably nearly as likely that lighting will strike your home's wiring, so unless you are unplugging that also, the additional risk of feedline-not-out-the-window is negligible.</p>

<h3>2. Don't throw it out the window, but ground it really well, inside.</h3>

<p>If you can arrange for a good Earth ground, and put a connector on it, you can detach your feedline and connect it to this ground. This is as good as throwing it out the window, without the difficulties of protecting the feedline's end from the elements. It still wouldn't hurt to have this grounding point be physically away from your valuable equipment, where possible.</p>

<p>Note that in this case, it's important that the ground you use for the feedline when it's disconnected is used <em>only</em> for that purpose. It exists to reduces the chances that current from a strike traveling on the feedline will arc into your house wiring, ductwork, pipes, or desk.</p>

<p>If you were to say, connect a radio chassis to this ground, you have now created a real problem, even if you disconnect the feedline, because you <em>haven't actually disconnected it</em>. Should lightning strike the power lines, or even strike somewhere close to your house, there could be hundreds or maybe thousands of volts difference between the utility ground at the electric distribution panel, and the extra one you added for the feedline. Your radio is sitting between these two points, a lot of current will flow through it, and you might be sad. Lightning current from a strike on the antenna will likewise go through your radio, to the electric distribution panel. Bad.</p>

"What are the effects on an ATAS-120A screwdriver antenna with a limited ground plane?","626","","<p>I'm going to be installing an ATAS-120A screwdriver antenna at the corner of a metal roof building, without radials going out over 270 degrees of the plane it's on.</p>

<p>Will this significantly change the omnidirectional nature of this antenna?</p>

<p>Will it significantly change the transmit and receive performance?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Will this significantly change the omnidirectional nature of this antenna?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. For 270 degrees of azimuth, you have no ground plane. Or another way of looking at it: you are missing 3/4ths of your radials.</p>

<p>There will still be some radiation in every direction, but you may find that there is significantly less radiation in the direction where you have no ground plane, and the take-off angle in that direction will be higher as well.</p>

<p>The picture is additionally complicated by the fact that you do have a sort of ""ground plane"" even where there is no roof: the Earth. There will be significant capacitance between the vertical element and the Earth, meaning Earth is going to pick up some of the ground plane's job. The Earth is very lossy, so this can't do anything good for antenna efficiency, and Earth is also not at the base of the antenna, so the feedpoint impedance will probably not be what it would otherwise be.</p>

<p>Depending on how you route the feedline, that may appear to the antenna as a radial (there being no better options around), and you may have to do something about the resulting common-mode currents.</p>

<p>It's hard to quantify exactly what the result will be, since it will depend on your particular geometry and Earth conditions. If you have access to some modelling software you could find out, but in any case it's safe to say the result will be less than ideal. It will work, however, as any number of sub-optimally mounted mobile antennas demonstrate.</p>

"In Vehicle Mounting recommendations","625","","<p>Just looking for some general advice for in-car radio mounting.</p>

<p>In my previous vehicle (06' Ford focus ZX3), I simply screwed the metal brackets into the dash which worked fine for an old beater car.</p>

<p>Now I have a 2014 Nissan Xterra X and want to be a bit more careful, especially since I have a loan to pay off.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any experience with this situation? I just want a non-permanent solution that wouldn't void any warranties. No drastic modifications.</p>

<p>I currently have a Baofeng UV5R+, Uniden BC880 CB, and a Uniden BC355n Scanner. I plan on replacing the Baofeng handheld with a small Yaesu or Kenwood Dual-band mobile unit at some point.</p>

<p>Below is a picture of what my interior looks like for an example.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8g8GF.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8g8GF.jpg"" alt=""Xterra Interior""></a></p>
","<p>Sometimes doing the right mount means getting the right rig.  I am not familiar with the rigs you plan to install but when I decided to install a mobile rig in my truck, I studied my options before buying the rig and made my decision on what fits best.  In my case, it was two rigs:  HF Transceiver and VHF/UHF FM Transceiver.</p>

<p>I figured my favored  configuration was to use my cup holder (between the seats) and a cup holder radio mount.  Since I can see the entire range of the console unit between the two front seats, not sure if this method applies.  Here is a photo of the kind of mount:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KsEJy.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KsEJy.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Indeed, that is an Icom 706 in the image which is the HF radio I ended up getting because of the removable head piece (like shown).</p>

<p>My VHF/UHF rig is the Yaesu FT-7800R (no longer available new) and it would share the same space but no mounted, it just laid around some place convenient (such as the storage box between the seats) since I never had to look at it and could use the mic buttons to switch memory cells of favored frequencies.</p>

<p>What I liked about my solution is that absolutely no holes in plastic parts (see below, some holes drilled) and nothing permanent placed anywhere up front -- not even sticky tape.  Only one cord for each radio followed under the carpet to the rear seat of my pickup truck (crew cab so extra space) and the main base unit of each radio sat under the seat with access to antennas and power -- nothing visible or in the way of any other activity.</p>

<p>The photo below shows under the rear seat of the crew cab extension on my Chevy Silverado (2004) pickup truck.  This particular photo only shows the base unit for the Icom 706 but the Yaesu is about the same size and sits right next to it.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1tx66.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1tx66.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>In the photo you can see my power distribution boxes from cables that run from the battery in the front of the truck, through the firewall (an opening already existed there) and then under and along side the main frame of the truck and then up through the floor to the distribution boxes which support fuses.  Since this photo was taken (about 7 years ago) I have installed a fused West Mountain Radio Anderson Power Pole distribution box making it more convenient to add and remove equipment.</p>

<p>By the way, there to the lower right of the distribution box is a UHF extender about 2 inches long that goes through the floor of the cab and provides for PL-259 adapter hookup under and in the truck for the main HF antenna coax.</p>

"Does a tube based HF transmitter need an antenna tuner?","622","","<p>With the adjustments on a transmitter such as a Yaesu FT-101E, is there any purpose for an antenna tuner, or can you accomplish the same thing by adjusting the loading and other controls?</p>

<p>An external antenna tuner can usually work with a much broader mismatch range. If you have a ""random wire"" or otherwise untuned antenna, a tuner is clearly required. A slight mismatch (2:1 or less) can be handled by the tube amplifier's controls.</p>

"33cm 5W(effective output power) tx amplifier for ATV (HamTV)","621","","<p>I am searching for a 5W effective output power TX amplifier that I can use with my BladeRF to send DVB-T Signals for ATV (33cm band).</p>

<p>Can someone tell me on what things I have to look for when buying an amplifier for this usage, beside minimum input power, bandwidth and frequency?</p>
","<p>DVB-T signals are OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing), which means that you take your symbols, put them in a vector, put that vector through a discrete fourier transform, and get the time-domain signal you want to transmit.</p>

<p>Now, this is fine and all, but OFDM hence has a high Peak-to-average power ratio. Which means that your amplifier needs to be quite linear across large dynamic range – otherwise, you'll get nonlinearities, which means intermodulation, which means (in OFDM, at least) inter-symbol interference, which means symbol errors, which means bit errors... For means of PAPR reduction in DVB signals, <a href=""http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijdmb/2010/797393/"" rel=""nofollow"">this paper</a> might be of interest. The takeaway from that paper is that in an easy 1% of the symbols (i.e. in 1% of your data carrying units), there is a PAPR > 12.</p>

<p>I'd say that infers a need for a spurious-free dynamic range of at least 20dB for your amplifier. Note that an amplifier rated for an output power $x$ will not be linear close to that power – take away around 9 dB, and you'd typically end up close to the upper edge of your linear range. That means that if you need 5W of power in the linear range, your amplifier would typically be rated $8\cdot 5\,\text W= 40\,\text W$. Note that this is really just a rule of thumb. How conservatively sellers spec their maximum output power or how much the amplifier is designed for maximum single-carrier or broadband transmission, or power efficiency, will play a big role. There's no way around getting some curve or numbers from which you can see how linear an amplifier is, over what range.</p>

<p>Now, the HackRF, being very universal, is not a spectacularly ""clean"" device, which means that your output signal might (will!) contain out-of-band emissions. You should probably counter that with an analog filter, which doesn't have to be overly sharp – just make sure no multiples of your center frequency and no dividers of it make it into the output. </p>

<p>Look for impedance matching. I'm not quite sure, but from the top of my head, the HackRF has a nominal output impedance of 50 Ohm. It's probably slightly different for different frequencies, but you'll not lose much with that. </p>

<p>Make sure the amplifier is not leaking back too much energy into it's input (input/output isolation). Rule of thumb: Max output power of HackRF - 3dB should be the maximum amount you leak back. Make sure not to start the HackRF in receive mode if the energy leaked into the connector would kill the sensitive input electronics.</p>

<ul>
<li>Can the antenna wires for both bands be fed at a common point by the coax?</li>
</ul>
","<p>Yes, this works fine. It is often called a ""fan dipole"".</p>

<p>There are separate resonant dipoles for each band, all fed from a common point. The wires should be separated by a foot or more. If you have enough tie points at the ends, you can run them in slightly different directions.</p>

<p>The resonant dipole will have a low impedance, around 50 Ohms. The non-resonant one will have a higher impedance and will not accept much signal.</p>

<p>The antennas will interact with each other, so you may need to tune them to length iteratively. Most people start by adjusting the length of the longer antenna first.</p>

<p>The 40m antenna will also be close to resonance on 15m, so you can probably use it on that band with an antenna tuner.</p>

"Noise & shielding, SDR Dongle","602","","<p>First, I'm very new to SDR.  This may turn out to be really obvious.  I just want to verify my thoughts before I spend more dollars.</p>

<p>I have a USB dongle with the RT28xx in it.  Works great.  Side by side I have a 35 year old Azden 2 meter receiver.  What I'm noticing is that the Azden seems to be able to pull in somewhat weak signals while the SDR doesn't even register a signal in the waterfall view.  This is true even when I hook the SDR dongle up to the same antenna that I've got on the Azden.</p>

<p>To my mind there are two possible issues.  First, the noise in the dongle is so high that the signal is way below the noise floor.  Second, the dongle simply does't have the sensitivity to pull out the signal.</p>

<p>I'm leaning toward option 1 (noise in the dongle) and I see some 30 to 50  dollar shielding arrangements for the dongles.  From my description of what I'm seeing, would any experts agree that 1 is the more likely option?</p>
","<p>While the other answer is quite detailed, this one is much shorter and specific:  I purchased and installed an aluminum RF shield for the dongle.  The noise floor is significantly lower as a result!  I was able to drop it even further by adding a ferrite bead to the USB cable.  (I was already using a 10' extension to get it away from the computer.)</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>Watching the waterfall display while adding a ferrite bead to the USB cable and to the feed line where it immediately enters the dongle also reduced the noise visibly.  Note that this was not a <em>huge</em> visible difference, but seeing a visible intensity change, even minor, in the background noise can really make a difference when looking for weak signals (which is what I do).</p>

"Digital modes on Field Day","588","","<p>My club is considering doing digital modes next year for Field Day. There are a few issues that we are discussing, including:</p>

<ol>
<li>What modes are most commonly used?</li>
<li>How many contacts could be made?</li>
<li>What is the best set up for a digital station? Multi-band?</li>
<li>What mode will give the least interference with CW operations, but the most contacts?</li>
</ol>

<p>In other words, we are trying to figure out how to set up a good digital station, and looking for some feedback along these lines. As Field Day is fresh in everyone's minds, I thought I'd ask and see what we can do.</p>

<p>To add a bit of information, I'm thinking primarily of HF modes, with some thought as to typical VHF modes. We haven't tried yet, because the club is worried about a low number of contacts for a potentially large amount of work. We aren't thinking of doing anything like meteor scatter, at least not at this time, just standard HF communication, with a chance of VHF with standard propagation modes.</p>
","<p>The number of contacts will depend much on the band conditions. But to get a feel for the number of points you might gain for your efforts, you might take a look at what participants in 2012/2013/2014 managed to achieve. Here's one sample: <a href=""http://k8bxq.org/node/7"" rel=""nofollow"">http://k8bxq.org/node/7</a>
To gauge the rate of growth in popularity (to get an idea of the prospects for next year) take a look at the ARRL's FD results, where you'll find totals for digital contacts over the years:
<a href=""http://www.arrl.org/files/file/ContestResults/2012/2012-FD-QST-V3.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.arrl.org/files/file/ContestResults/2012/2012-FD-QST-V3.pdf</a></p>

<p>Each contact counts the same as a CW contact (x2) but you don't need someone with CW skills, and digital operating skills are a good bit easier to learn than CW... so a digital station might provide a bonus in terms of available skilled operators.</p>

<p>You'll need to take the same precautions to avoid receiver desense and related strong-signal issues, as with other modes. But many digital modes can perform effectively at low power, so they can be less prone to inter-station interference on FD. Additionally, many of the digital modes are more immune to interference, and are less likely to be troubled by the CW ops. With care, and adequate antenna separation, you might find that the CW and digi-station can share the same band without serious issues - which can be a real bonus when only one band seems to be open on FD.</p>

<p>PSK31 has been around for a very long time, works great with low power and high noise, is very straightforward to use, works great on HF, and should definitely be one of the modes you'll want to use. But if you can be flexible, you'll find that changing to another mode after exhausting all the PSK31 ops on a particular band can help boost your numbers. With a computer running a flexible digi-mode app you will have your choice of virtually any of the HF digi-modes available at your digi station - so plan to use them all! </p>

<p>In my set up i'm putting a dipole on my roof. I've connected the two dipole elements together with a 100k resistor, and have a balun and amplifier just under the roof, then 20m of coax to my receiver. So to protect the balun and amplifier I need ESD to shunt to ground before it reaches the amp.</p>

<p>Should I ground the antenna via the mast and some heavy gauge wire leading to a grounding rod? And then connect the shield/gnd element of the dipole to the grounded mast? I could then also use a gas discharge tube on the line before the balun and amp.</p>

<p>But if I do this, won't I affect the dipole by essentially lengthening the ground side element via the mast and grounding rod?</p>
","<p>The typical amateur radio / SWL budget will rarely allow for sufficient protection from a direct lightning strike. More often than not, the measures taken help minimize damage from a direct strike but more importantly they mitigate damage from near lightning strikes and static build-up. </p>

<p>If the goal is to bleed static and minimize damage then mast should be grounded (this is also an NEC requirement). The grounding should be carried out with a heavy gauge conductor (minimum of #6 by NEC) leading to a ground rod. The efficacy of the ground can be improved by using wide copper straps. The ground rods should be tied to the house system ground rod(s) with a minimum of #6 AWG wire.</p>

<p>The cellular industry has promoted bringing the coax down to the ground level and installing a lightning arrestor bonded directly to the ground system at this point. This is considered a best practice for amateur radio installations as well. If you cannot route the coax in this manner, installing a lightning arrestor in the coax at the mast and bonding it to the mast ground may provide some level of protection.</p>

<p>Be aware that your mast mounted pre-amp is considered lightning fodder. There is little that can be done to protect it from a near lightning strike when it is located so far from an effective ground. Some people advocate the use of an RFC (radio frequency choke) inductor across the input. This will offer some degree of protection but due to the rapid current rise (di/dt) during near lightning events, it is not likely to stop all damage.</p>

<p>Your resistor across the dipole legs will prove helpful to bleed of static that is generated by winds and nearby storms. You should periodically inspect this resistor as it too will be sacrificial in the event of a nearby strike.</p>

"What is the origin, history behind ""Ben's Best Bent Wire""?","575","","<h2>Bens Best Bent Wire</h2>

","<p>There is nothing especially unusual about this situation: a modulator in most radios will output only some very tiny power which then goes through multiple amplification stages. You just don't have all the stages.</p>

It's designed for the HPSDR, which just like your SDR has a very low power output. The PennyWhistle design is also greatly simplified by the lack of any output filtering: the assumption is that it will feed another amplifier stage which will be followed by filtering to remove any harmonic distortion introduced by the amplifier. It has 19 dB (about 80x) of gain, so with your 50 mW drive, will output about 4W, which should be enough to drive another amplifier. </p>

<p>Yes. Impedance matching will mean less losses between the antenna and your receiver, but the receiver's objective isn't energy harvesting. As long as the antenna is sensitive enough and the receiver's gain high enough that the predominant source of noise is RF noise, and not the receiver's internal noise, improving antenna efficiency will do nothing to help you.</p>

<p>In particular on the softrock kit, receiver gain is fixed. If you notice no difference between a dummy load and your antenna on a quiet frequency, try increasing the gain. Increase it just until the RF noise floor is just a bit above the receiver's and your sound card's noise floor: this will give you the highest dynamic range.</p>

<p>As the satellite spins, the dipole rotates, and the resulting polarization of the dipole also rotates.  For instance it may go from horizontal polarization to vertical and back again.  </p>

<p>If you transmit to the satellite with a horizontal or vertical polarized yagi, your transmit yagi will sometimes have the same polarization as the receive at the satellite and sometimes it will not.  When the polarizations are different there can be cross polarization loss of up to 20-30db.  </p>

<p>This is the phenomena behind spin fading. It can be corrected by using circular polarization at the transmitting or receiving location or both.  The loss of a linear polarization antenna from/to a circular one is about a constant 3db over the case where both of the antennas are circular polarized, and because it is constant it is not affected by spin.</p>

<p>If you have a couple of loose polarized sunglass lenses, you can place them against each other and rotate one of them while keeping the other stationary, you will see a similar effect with the variable attenuation of light travelling through the pair of lenses.</p>

<p>However, it should be easy to generate such a list yourself over time.  Start broadcasting APRS packets on HF and watch APRS-IS feeds for your packets.  You should be able to determine what iGate passed them to the internet, and you can then find out the location of that iGate from its own APRS packets.  This will have to be done slowly over time as propagation changes, and to avoid preventing others from using the band.</p>

<p>Note that in order to make packets as small as possible, repeating stations strip some information from the packet as they repeat it.  This information would tell you what station(s) your packet has already gone through - in other words, your generated list of iGates will only show those iGates that actually placed your packet on the internet, not any inbetween that have repeated it.  Further, some HF igates may not be directly connected to the internet, thus you might find a packet gets received on HF, repeated on 2M, then received by a 2M iGate connected to the internet.  You'd see the last repeater in the packet on the internet, however since 2M is generally short-haul, it's likely that even if some packets are repeated via radios before hitting the internet you'll still get a good idea of the position of the actual HF receiver, since you're most likely interested in general regional positions of HF APRS gateways and repeaters.</p>

<p>If so, is there any restrictions on how the hopping should be performed?</p>
","<p>To answer your second question first:</p>

<p>The FCC doesn't regulate the use of frequency hopping within the amateur radio spectrum.  The band plan has suggested modes of operation, which don't include mention of frequency hopping, within the amateur radio spectrum, but also include many ""experimental"" allocations where you could engage in any form of frequency hopping you might want to attempt.</p>

<p>As far as whether frequency hopping is considered the most effective use of a given chunk of bandwidth, the answer is no.  No one officially states or implies that frequency hopping is a particularly effective or most effective use of a frequency.  Depending on what form of frequency hopping you use, you may be able to more effectively or efficiently use a frequency than with some other modes, but not always.</p>

<p>Note, however, that the wording is very subjective, ""most effective use of the amateur service frequencies"" doesn't restrict users from consuming a 25kHz FM channel with slow morse code, even though one couldn't easily prove that this is the most effective use of that frequency.  It may be that they should be using a different mode, but it's possible that they're running an experiment that is most effectively carried out in this manner.</p>

<p>There is a wide range of what might be considered most effective, and as long as people aren't regularly abusing the spectrum we're given, there's little need to try to force ""one true way"" on the community, and add artificial restrictions to stop theoretical problems.</p>

"Does a balun need to be made with coax?","564","","<h1>The short version</h1>

<p>My understanding is that one of the main reasons to use a balun with coax is to prevent the outside of the shield from becoming part of your antenna system. If that's the case, won't a design like the one pictured below be ineffective? Can't current flow to the outside of the shield at the coax connector, before the windings?</p>

<h1>The long version</h1>

<p>I'm new to the HF bands. My understanding is that baluns are good practice when feeding a dipole from coax (or any balanced system from an unbalanced one)--the idea being to ensure the currents on the two conductors are equal and opposite. With coax in particular, due to skin effect, the inside and outside of the shield act as different conductors. The inside is balanced with the center conductor, but the outside of the shield is not balanced with anything, so any current there causes undesired radiation. A balun ensures all the power goes to the antenna, not to the outside of the coax (and also works the other way, preventing undesired signals from being picked up by the outer shield).</p>

<p>At least that's my understanding.</p>

<p>I've seen a few designs for baluns, and I'll describe a couple here. The first two make sense to me, but the third doesn't, and I'm wondering why (or if) it really works.</p>

<p><strong>Design 1: A section of coax with one or more ferrite beads</strong><br>
The effectiveness would obviously depend on the beads used, but this would act as an inductor and impede RF on the outer shield, while the currents inside the shield would remain unaffected and balanced.</p>

<p><strong>Design 2: A coil of coax</strong><br>
This can be air-wound or on a core. Either way, similar to #1, inductance blocks RF on the outside of the shield while currents inside the shield pass through.</p>

<p><strong>Design 3: Parallel wires wrapped around a core (see picture below)</strong><br>
This is the one that doesn't make sense to me. The windings would block common-mode currents, sure. So I suppose your antenna would be fed a balanced signal. But the coax ends before the windings. Wouldn't that mean RF can still flow to the outside of the shield?</p>

</ul>
","<p>I'll explain the operation of that balun very briefly: for the differential mode (which by definition has equal but opposite currents on each conductor), each conductor induces an equal but opposite magnetic flux in the core. These magnetic fluxes cancel, and so the differential mode sees no inductance: it's as if the core and the windings aren't there.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the common mode interacts with the core like an ordinary, single wire, and sees a large inductance. This high inductance makes the common mode on the coax a high impedance (hopefully) relative to a lower impedance path like radials, the other arm of a dipole, or some other deliberate counterpoise.</p>

<p>But I think your question isn't really about how it works. Rather, it's a mental hangup right here:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With coax in particular, due to skin effect, the inside and outside of the shield act as different conductors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, I bet you are thinking that with the balun pictured in your question, the end of the coax is ""exposed"", and that means common mode current can ""get in"", causing problems. You may be thinking once the common-mode current is inside it's stuck there, isolated from the outside by skin effect. With coiled coax or coax through beads the integrity of the coax is maintained, so nothing can ""get in"".</p>

<p>I remember reading statements like that many times when I was trying to wrap my head around these same concepts, and I found them very misleading.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the shield is one conductor. So if someone says it's acting like two different conductors, what are they trying to say? Is it <em>really</em> like two conductors? If we can make one conductor behave like two, couldn't we exploit that to reduce the number of conductors required for all kinds of cable assemblies? And having established one conductor can behave as two conductors, are those two resulting ""conductors"" subject to the same rule? By repeated division, could we make one conductor behave as any number of conductors? If the shield is already like two conductors, why do we need a third inner conductor?</p>

<p>This seems highly suspect to me. I think it's a terrible phrasing of a property that does more to cultivate incorrect ideas than anything else. Here's how I'd put it:</p>

<p><em>The current on any transmission line can be considered the superposition of a differential mode and a common mode.</em></p>

<p>The neat thing is you can analyze each separately and independently, then <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superposition_principle"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">add the two together</a> and get the same result. I think that's what the statement about skin effect is trying to say. And the fact that the common mode ends up on the outside of the shield, and the differential mode on the inside is just a bit of physics trivia.</p>

<p>It isn't that the balanced mode current is flowing on the inside that prevents it from radiating: it's that it's cancelled by an equal and opposite current (and voltage) on the inner conductor. Look to balanced twin-lead transmission lines for a counter example: the current isn't ""concealed from our view"" by any kind of shield. And yet, they don't radiate because the <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/q/3508/218"">equal but opposite fields in each conductor cancel</a>.</p>

<p>The advantage of coax over twin-lead is that outside the shield, the cancellation of balanced mode fields is complete, whereas for twin-lead we need to go away some multiple of the conductor spacing before that happens.</p>

<p>Let's consider a cross-section of coax with equal but opposite charges on the center and shield, and the associated electric fields:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wsZWb.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wsZWb.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Added together, there's no field at points outside the shield. That the charges are on the inside of the shield is really not the primary thing to be thinking about, because if the charges on the inner conductor went away, the charges on the shield would migrate to the outside.</p>

<p>And so getting back to your question about the balun, you don't need to be concerned so much with the distinction between the inside and the outside of the shield. Rather, think about maintaining equal and opposite currents and charges on the shield and center. If you do that, the fields will cancel like this, and the coax won't radiate.</p>

<p>While I'll likely go with a magnetically mounted vertical antenna, I've been thinking of other more covert options.</p>

<p>For instance, could I do a 1/2 wave dipole mounted along the roof? A 2m dipole is just a little over 3 feet and would easily fit along the edge or middle. I'd need to insulate it, I'm sure, but would that work or be worth the effort? What about vertically along a door frame?</p>

<p>The bumper is already insulated. Even if the car body reflects the RF in one direction, could I then combine one in the front and one in the back bumper?</p>
","<p>A horizontal VHF dipole above a (presumably metallic) car roof is not a good idea. Because the car roof is relatively large relative to wavelength, and is a good conductor, you will get a lot of RF current in it through capacitive and inductive coupling. This isn't a bad thing in itself, but because the geometry of your car isn't designed as an antenna, the result will be difficult to predict and probably not very good.</p>

<p>Here's one problem: if we think of the car roof as an infinite conductive plane (just a rough approximation of reality), it will make an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_antenna"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">image antenna</a>. If your dipole is very close to the roof, then this image antenna will cancel most of your antenna's radiation. As you get it higher you will get less cancellation, but most of the radiation will be up, towards the sky. <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/a/487/218"">When you get it to half a wavelength high, then this is no longer a problem</a>, but then why not just use a mag-mount vertical, which is just as tall? For a vertical, the ground plane and resulting image antenna is a good thing.</p>

<p>Of course your car isn't an infinite plane. RF currents will flow all over the car body, and probably you will get a lot of radiation from <a href=""http://www.antenna-theory.com/antennas/aperture/slot.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">slot antennas</a> formed by seams in the car body. The trouble is we don't know what they will be. They probably won't offer a good match to your 50Ω coax.</p>

<p>Also, the polarization could be anything. By convention, FM on VHF uses vertical polarization. If you happen to radiate with horizontal radiation, you will only be heard by most people through paths that rotate your polarization. In practice, this means a loss on the order of 30dB. Radiation from your car body probably won't be entirely horizontal, so it may not be so bad, but most likely, it won't be so good.</p>

<p>Another issue may be the electronics in your car. With the dipole laying against the car body (anywhere), the coupling between the dipole and the car body is so good you might as well have soldered the feedline directly to the car body and skipped the dipole. It's obvious then how much RF current is in the car body, and all the wiring attached to it. Automotive electronics are usually pretty robustly engineered, but I'm not sure I'd trust them to work with an RF transmitter hooked up to them.</p>

<p>It isn't rated for tensile strength in long lengths, so you'd have to do some experimentation to find a safe tension and load range, but for most HAM antennas it should be more than enough.  Don't try to use it as a guy wire for a mast, though.</p>

"How to make an inductor?","554","","<p>I am a high school student and am making a project on FM receiver for class 11. I am following this circuit diagram:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/61gCI.gif"" alt=""Schematic""></p>

<p>The L2 in this diagram is a 22µH RF Choke. The part listed in the <a href=""http://www.somerset.net/arm/fm_only_one_transistor_radio.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""website"">website</a> has the configuration provided below in its <a href=""http://www.mouser.com/ds/2/54/70f_series-62652.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">datasheet</a>.</p>

<p>I know how to make inductors but some properties such as the thickness of the copper wire (in SWG), whether enameled or not, no. of turns to use and the diameter and length of the inductor is confusing me. </p>

<p>And as an additional note can u please mention the number of turns in the L1 and the thickness of the copper wire to be used that will be suitable for the circuit diagram. </p>
","<p>First thing first: Whenever you make an inductor, wire must be insulated for the working voltage of the circuit or higher. Otherwise, you get shorted turns and your inductor turns into jut normal conductor.</p>

<p>Next, since you're high-school student, my advice would be to just use one of the calculators for coil inductance and get the results from there. One I used to use is <a href=""http://hamwaves.com/antennas/inductance.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. Most of the calculators I've seen work a bit backwards from what you need: You give them physical properties of your coil, and they give you back inductance.  <a href=""http://coil32.narod.ru/calc/multi_layer-en.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Here</a> is one that will let you enter inductance and will give you number of turns needed. </p>

<p>In general, it's the best to just buy the recommended part, but I fully understand that it may be difficult or impossible to source that component in reasonable amount, in reasonable time-frame and for reasonable price. Therefore, some experimentation may be needed if you must manufacture the part by yourself. </p>

<p>In general, the math behind the calculators is quite complex, so I do not consider it reasonable to calculate all properties of an inductor by hand. Still, there's <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductor#Inductance_formulae"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> formula sheet at Wikipedia that has some useable formulas for inductance calculations. It can be very useful for tweaking the input parameters of calculators. </p>

"Where can I find the official definition of ITU Zones?","554","","<p>I've been looking around for a spot that has the official definition of what the various ITU Zones are, but can't find one. What is the official definition? I'm hoping for more than just a map, unless said map is VERY detailed and can be downloaded as a KML or similar map. Something like the <a href=""http://www.cq-amateur-radio.com/cq_awards/cq_waz_awards/cq_waz_list.html"" rel=""nofollow"">CQ Zone definition</a> would be adequate.</p>
","<p>Per <a href=""http://www.itu.hamatlas.eu/Strefy_strony/Introduction.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this document</a>: Larry E. Price W4RA, the IARU president in 2002, requesting the definitive ITU zone definitions - wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You have to keep in mind that the ITU has one administrative purpose for having zones that has nothing at all to do
  with amateur radio.</p>
  
  <p>However, various amateur radio organizations decided to have both awards and operating events on the air based on the idea of
  zones.</p>
  
  <p>But, since this is not why the zones exist as far as ITU is concerned, the sponsors of these amateur events are free to
  interpret the zone boundaries any way they wish. So, there might not
  be a single ""official amateur radio zone list.""</p>
  
  <p>For the US &amp; Canada, the interpretation by ARRL is found in The ARRL Operating Manual, desk top reference, page 12 which
  defines the boundaries between US States and Canadian provinces.</p>
  
  <p>If you have more questions about any particular contest or award, they should be directed to the sponsor.</p>

"Starter package?","553","","<p>What are some online resources that can be used for finding an HT package? </p>
","<p>I am a new Ham (K7BED) and only transmitted for the second time, today. I want to say to purchase a low cost HT (such as a Baofeng UV-5/5R/5RA/whatever) but that was what I did and it was a waste of money and nothing but frustration.</p>

<p>I just went out today to a local Amateur Radio shop and picked up an Alinco DJ-500T and so far I love it! When comparing the two radios side by side my contact today said that the Alinco wins by far for voice clarity and volume. Plus the Alinco is NOT ridiculously hard to program.</p>

<p>Right now I have the standard antenna on the Alinco.</p>

<p>I will repeat what I've seen other's mention and that is to buy a low cost (100-200 dollars, stackexchange can't use dollar signs in answers apparently) dual-band HT such as from Alinco, Yaesu, Kenwood (though I've not found a dual-band Kenwood for under $300 or so new), Icom, etc.</p>

<p>I went to <a href=""http://www.aesham.com/ham-radios-handheld-multiband/"" rel=""nofollow"">AES web store</a> (just one example of many online stores) and browsed through what they have. The first Japanese radio (though it is produced in China I think) was the Alinco DJ-500T for $129.99, then the Yaesu FT-60R which is a little bit bigger and didn't fit my hand as well when I looked at both in-store today. I preferred the Alinco mainly because it fit better in my hand, but also because I saw a video online showing how to manually program the Alinco and I thought it made more sense than the Yaesu.</p>

<p>If you can, definitely purchase a non-knock-off Diamond or other higher-end antenna for your HT, though honestly I am not unhappy with the stock antenna of this Alinco.</p>

<p>You may also want to invest in a AA battery pack if the radio you choose has one available for purchase. The Alinco DJ-500T does not have such an accessory available for purchase.</p>

<p>You may also want to invest in a magmount antenna for your car or vehicle. And you may want to consider purchasing extra batteries so that you will never have a dead battery.</p>

<p>Also consider purchasing the ARRL Repeater Directory or sign up on repeaterbook.com and print off your local repeaters and those that are in the areas you travel in.</p>

<p>You may want to check into any local ARES/RACES groups and repeater groups as well, as you will find many local Hams who could definitely become your mentors.</p>

<p>I have yet to see a ""starter set"" for Ham Radio equipment, but if you decide to purchase from one specific vendor, either online or in-store, I'm sure they can hook you up with the things you will need.</p>

<p>I know there is a Diamond X50 antenna which usually would be firmly mounted to a pole in your yard for VHF and UHF reception for a VHF/UHF capable transceiver in your home (base station/portable/HT acting as base) if you don't plan on going mobile with the HT. That is just about $100 most places I think.</p>

<p>I know that as a newbie Ham Radio can be very confusing, and honestly I am still quite confused by many things but I am only a few months into being licensed.</p>

<p>All that being said, you will definitely need to be licensed before you transmit for the first time. And the Volunteer Examiners can become your mentors as well. They will have a lot of good advice for you. I live in a tiny population town but I have met a lot of great Hams here.</p>

<p>So I would go into radio shops (such as Ham Radio Outlet if they have actual storefronts, Universal Radio, American Electronic Supply, and I'm sure there are other small outfits all over the USA and other countries.</p>

<p>If you are licensed as a Technician I'd definitely suggest a dual-band HT that handles VHF and UHF (144mhz band and 440m mhz band) and you wanted to spend the money up front you could go with a mobile or portable transceiver that also does the 50mhz (6 meter) band. If you do plan on quickly getting licensed as a General or Extra feel free to purchase equipment that can handle all modes, and HF + 6M + 2M + 70cm and higher if you want. But you will also need to factor in cost for the antennas and connectors and installation, plus antenna analyzers and other equipment you will need.</p>

"What makes cellphone transmissions so energy cheap?","552","","<p>The modern cellphone can carry on a full duplex conversation for a time period measured in hours on a battery half the size of my handheld transceiver.  My transceiver can barely receive for that length of time on its pack, nevermind transmit, and that's if I have a huge antenna much more unwieldy than the antennas included in modern phones..</p>

<p>One issue is that the cellphone in urban areas only needs to transmit a few miles, and the receiver can be significant more energy expensive to pick out weak signals.  In terms of our hobby, Repeaters are equivalent - allowing a smaller, more energy efficient handheld appear to be a big transmitter nearby - but the handheld is still an energy hog, and still limited to a small area around the repeater. Besides, the average cellular phone will still work for hours of talk time even when the nearest cell site is 10 miles away.</p>

<p>Given that the technology exists, what is it that's preventing our amateur radios from achieving such good energy efficiency while still reaching a dozen miles for voice communications? </p>
","<p>Remember that carriers are selling bandwidth, that’s it.  Actually, they are overselling it, exactly like cable modems (but that's another story).  If everyone in the coverage area of a cell tower tried to make a call at once, most of them would be unhappy.</p>

<p>The carriers paid a boat load of money for their chunk of spectrum and their overriding goal is to maximize their use of their chunk. Since there is (in theory) competition, there is a focus on quality of service since all the plans seem strangely similar in price. </p>

<p>Towers are expensive, but as the others have mentioned, phones only have to transmit a few km at most to hit a tower and often less than 1 km in urban areas.  </p>

<p>Cell phones use a heavily optimized spread spectrum digital mode that is focused on short haul weak signal work.  Towers have a limit of 100W (omnidirectional) or 500W directional, however, in practice towers typically transmit in the range of 25-60 watts.</p>

<p>In most countries cell phones are limited to 2W PEP, however most modern cell phones have a peak power of about 300mW and are typically transmitting in the 100mW range.  </p>

<p>In order to limit interference with adjacent sites, cell towers actively manage the transmit power both in the tower and on phones throughout a call, even between words.  In this case, what’s good for the carrier is good for the consumer since their drive to minimize power use means the phone’s battery lasts that much longer.</p>

<p><em><strong>Contrast this with HTs</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>First batteries</strong> – Economy of scale has let cell phone manufacturers use custom LiPo batteries for years where these are only now becoming standard on HTs.  Lots of the HTs out there have NiMH or even NiCd batteries still; a lower energy density.</p>

<p><strong>Power</strong> – If a cell phone were to transmit 5W PEP FM, it would run dead just as fast as an HT with the same size battery. The energy efficiency is in the mode used and the fact that the required range is very low.</p>

<p><strong>Role</strong> – Cell phones are designed to work only where people typically go: on the roads, shopping areas, cities and the infrastructure is sited to handle that.  However, people that use HT’s typically spend a good part of their time in places people don’t go as much: parks, woods, mountains.  So you’d need more range even if you were using the same mode. </p>

<p>As Phil mentioned, we’ll see advanced features in add on modes first like D-STAR (Icom) and C4FM FDMA (Yaesu).  Of course, these guys are looking to sell radios, to there’s no incentive (yet) to agree on a protocol.  Initially this will just allow add on services.  It would take something major before people start replacing repeaters with ones that actively manage power.  Heck, it’s all some clubs can do to keep a basic 2m repeater up 24/7/365 on volunteer labor.</p>

"Low parts count CW HF receiver?","550","","<p>I'd like to be able to provide my kids with the opportunity to build something a little better than a passive crystal set, but still very, very simple in terms of individual electronic parts count.</p>

<p>It seems to me that a CW receiver should be the easiest type to build, if I'm incorrect and an AM is easier, or just as easy, let me know.</p>

<p><strong>What is the lowest parts count receiver one can build that covers some portion of the HF spectrum likely to have CW signals in it?</strong></p>

<p>I'd prefer low cost parts, but low parts count is still the most important requirement.  Ideally it could be breadboarded, but point to point wiring is fine. It doesn't have to be great audio quality, or even very selective and immune to noise.  It just needs to be able to pick up enough of a signal that a careful listener will notice the CW in the static.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a receiver design that needs 20 parts or less? 10 parts? Fewer?</strong></p>
","<p>For CW, a simple regenerative receiver will produce an audio sidetone.  Such radios were actually usable and used by radio hobbyists to receive HF CW.  So I would search for a design of a 2 transistor regenerative receiver (2nd transistor used to isolate or drive some headphones) in vintage hobby electronic magazines and kits dating from the earliest decade of the availability of transistors to hobbyists.  Probably somewhere between 10 and 20 parts, depending on how you count them.  You might have to wind your own inductor coil(s).</p>

"What gain do I need to talk to SO-50 with my HT?","546","","<p>My HT has 5 W of power, a sensitivity of about 0.2 µV, and I would like to talk to the SO-50 with it. How much gain do I need in my antenna to make this work?</p>
","<p>The specifications from AMSAT for the <a href=""http://www.amsat.org/amsat-new/satellites/sat_summary/so50.php"">SO-50</a> are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The repeater consists of a miniature VHF receiver with sensitivity of
  -124dBm, having an IF bandwidth of 15 KHz. The receive antenna is a 1/4 wave vertical mounted in the top corner of the spacecraft. The
  receive audio is filtered and conditioned then gated in the control
  electronics prior to feeding it to the 250mW UHF transmitter. The
  downlink antenna is a 1/4 wave mounted in the bottom corner of the
  spacecraft and canted at 45 degrees inward.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, what does all of that mean? First of all, the 5W signal you send has to make it to the spacecraft and be received. Let's just assume a uniform gain from the spacecraft to start with. Let's also start with a uniform gain from the HT. The satellite footprint is about 3000 miles, so let's just say the maximum distance to the satellite is 2500 km, accounting for height and the radial distance. It should be close enough to get an idea. That means the one way path loss is about 128 dB. That means your signal would need to be at least 100W to be received, given no gain, as can be calculated by $$10\times{}\frac{10^{128-124}}{1000}$$ Bottom line, you need a gain of at least 12dB to make the satellite, and a bit more margin would be helpful.</p>

<p>As far as the receiving, that's where things are a bit trickier. The power can be found by $\frac{V^{2}}{R}$, and also converting the $V$ from peak to RMS. $R$ is usually 50 ohms. When you take all of that in to account, the specified minimum detection for the signal is $$-124 \log_{10}\left(\frac{\left(\frac{0.2\mathrm{e}-6}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2}{50} \times 1000\right) \times 10$$ (Basically, find power $\frac{V^2}{R}$, convert to mW, and convert to dBm). The satellite signal is only 250mW, and you're looking at the same path loss of the signal. The gain required is $10 \times \log_{10}\left(\frac{10^{128-124} \times 10}{250 \mathrm{mW}}\right)$, or about 26 dB. This is quite difficult to achieve, and usually requires a pre-amp to be effective, or a really good antenna.</p>

<p>Bottom line- Tx is 12dB, Rx is 26 dB, at max distance, and less for an overhead pass. </p>

"Would it be possible to transmit all CTCSS tones at once?","545","","<p>What happens if all CTCSS tones are transmitted at once? Would it trip all radios listening on that frequency?</p>
","<p>You could get several different results, depending on exactly how the receiver recognizes the expected tone.</p>

<p>From a small amount of web research, it sounds like the usual methods are either a filter passing only the expected tone, or a frequency counter which determines the frequency of the tone in the signal which is then compared with the expected tone frequency.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If the receiver uses a filter to detect the tone, then its squelch will open, because it doesn't care about any other part of the frequency content of the signal.</p></li>
<li><p>If the receiver uses a frequency counter to detect the tone, then if all the tones are close enough to equal strength, the counter will not have a valid output, just as if there was no tone at all (only noise) in the relevant frequency range.</p>

<p>However, there is likely to be some non-flat frequency response somewhere along the way, so one particular tone will win and the squelch will open only if that tone is the one the receiver is expecting.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>You will also run into issues transmitting all the tones at once — your audio signal will have high peaks as the tones beat against each other, and you will have to keep the total amplitude low to avoid over-deviating/distorting — quite likely low enough that the individual tones aren't strong enough to be recognized as CTCSS tones.</p>

<p>I thought I'd see what the actual result is, so I wrote a program with GNU Radio to synthesize the combination of all tones listed on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_Tone-Coded_Squelch_System#List_of_tones"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia's page</a>. In order to prevent the output from clipping (analogous to overdeviating in an analog FM signal), I had to set the amplitude of the individual tones to 0.05 (-26 dB), which is significantly below the 0.15 (-16 dB) level that Phil Frost's answer said is normal for CTCSS.</p>

","<p>A dummy load, or terminator, consists of a non-inductive power resistor (or multiple resistors in series and parallel) and a heat sink, both rated for the maximum power to be dissipated.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The simplest test on a dummy load you can perform is to <strong>measure it with an ohmmeter</strong> — it should be 50 Ω (or whatever the specified impedance is). Wiggle the connections while you're doing this to make sure it does not have an intermittent open circuit — I've found this to be a problem with some cheap terminators.</p></li>
<li><p>The above test tells us that it is 50 Ω at DC, or 0 Hz. It is possible that its impedance will be something else at higher frequencies; if it is, this is a design flaw (or limitation), because this impedance is affected by the geometry of the conductors between the resistor and the input connector. If you wanted to test this property, you would want an <strong>antenna analyzer</strong> which can sweep over the relevant frequency range and report the impedance or SWR, which you would check for being reasonably close to 50 Ω.</p>

<p>If you already have a transmitter, then you can in principle use a <em>SWR meter</em> combined with the transmitter, but most SWR meters that are sold separately are not sensitive enough for this little power to produce any reading at all. Additionally, the entire point of using a dummy load at all in this low-power situation is to avoid impedance-mismatch reflections damaging the transmitter (or triggering protective power fold-back), and if you need to test the dummy load then you in principle don't know whether there will be reflections or not, so it's not a safe test. In theory.</p></li>
<li><p>A dummy load should have the expected impedance, but so does an antenna. The difference between a dummy load and an antenna is that the dummy load mostly does not radiate. To test this characteristic, you would <strong>use a receiver</strong> to determine the radiated signal strength — ideally one with a signal strength meter (S-meter or RSSI). (You could use a <em>field strength meter</em> for calibrated results, but if you have that specialized gear...)</p>

<p>Note that there will always be <em>some</em> radiation — if not from the dummy load, then from the transmitter. No shielding is perfect. (And the HackRF One has no shielding, anyway.)</p></li>
<li><p>The final characteristic of a dummy load is power handling capability. To test this, increase transmit power until you smell smoke, then buy a replacement!</p>

<p>But you're not going to manage that with the HackRF One. I wouldn't even expect any noticeable warmth.</p></li>

","<p>According to the way things work for simple AX.25 packets, the part after "">"" is the destination address.  However, the APRS specification commonly repurposes fields, with the goal being to keep the packet as small as possible.  The destination field is like that: most APRS packets are broadcast rather than sent to a specific station, so when an APRS packet isn't meant for a specific station then the destination field is pressed into service to hold something else.  If the ""destination"" starts with AP, then it's a code that indicates what device or software package sent the packet.  In this case, a ""destination"" of the pattern APN3xx means that the packet was sent by a Kantronics KPC-3.  (The destination can also be Mic-E encoded, in which case it holds the latitude and part of the longitude of the sending station, plus a few other miscellaneous data flags.)</p>

<p>Similarly, <code>WIDE1-1</code> doesn't actually mean that the packet was repeated by a station of that name.  In this case, <code>WIDE1-1</code> is an instruction for how to repeat the packet, which was part of the packet when it was first sent.  It requests that a ""wide"" digipeater (one with a wide coverage area, like on a mountaintop) repeat the packet, but only once; if a second ""wide"" digipeater should hear the rebroadcast packet, then the second digipeater wouldn't repeat it.</p>

<p>Apparently <code>qAR</code> is the ""Q-construct"" that indicates that the packet was was successfully ""Igated"" to APRS-IS, the APRS internet packet routing system.</p>

<p>I'm reasonably familiar with APRS, but not an expert.  Even so I'll give the second part of your question a go, but I reserve the right to be wrong ;)</p>

<p><code>PACCTY&gt;APN390,HEBOWX,KFALLS,OR2*,qAR,STUKEL:</code> This packet was sent by PACCTY using a Kantronics KPC-3.  It was digipeated by HEBOWX, KFALLS, and OR2, and then copied onto APRS-IS, the internet APRS packet network, by STUKEL.  It's unlikely that that exact path was requested by the sender; it's more likely that the original path request was <code>WIDE1-1,WIDE2-1</code>.  <code>WIDE1-1</code> is a request for a small home digipeater to rebroadcast the packet.  <code>WIDE2-1</code> is a request for a high-up digipeaters to rebroadcast.  Each station that rebroadcasts the packet puts its call sign into the path.</p>

<p><code>PACCTY&gt;APN390,WIDE1-1,OR2-1,qAR,W7GC-4:</code>  Here we have a packet that was never digipeated before being copied to the internet; we can tell because there is no asterisk.  The original packet was heard by Igate W7GC-4 and copied onto APRS-IS there.  (The packet probably was digipeated, but when multiple copies of a packet are received on APRS-IS, then one is chosen at random to be kept, and the rest are ignored as being redundant.)</p>

<p>Because this packet was copied to APRS-IS before being digipeated, we have a better look at the original path request.  As I suspected, <code>WIDE1-1</code> is in there first as an invitation for small home digipeaters to repeat the packet.  Next comes <code>OR2-1</code>.  That could be a station OR2 with an SSID of ""-1"".  But given that the first packet didn't contain <code>OR2-1</code>, it seems like it is more likely to be an alias.  Maybe it works like <code>WIDE2-1</code>, but just in Oregon?  I'm not sure.</p>

<p>Just for grins, let's look again at the first packet and assume that it was sent with <code>WIDE1-1,WIDE2-1</code> to see how digipeaters modify the packets going through them.</p>

<p><code>PACCTY&gt;APN390,WIDE1-1,WIDE2-1:</code> original packet<br>
<code>PACCTY&gt;APN390,HEBOWX*,WIDE2-1:</code> packet was heard and digipeated by HEBOWX, which responded to the alias WIDE1 and substituted its own call sign<br>
<code>PACCTY&gt;APN390,HEBOWX,KFALLS*:</code> packet was heard and digipeated by KFALLS, responding to the alias WIDE2<br>
<code>PACCTY&gt;APN390,HEBOWX,KFALLS,OR2*,qAR,STUKEL:</code> packet was heard and copied to APRS-IS (but not digipeated) by STUKEL</p>

"Storage of a Baofeng UV-5R","531","","<p>I am trying to find a convenient place to store my Baofeng UV-5R, I believe the most convenient place to store it would be on its charger.</p>

<p>I was wondering if storing the UV-5R with its battery still installed, on the unplugged charger with its wall-wart power supply removed would drain the battery or have any negative effect on it.</p>
","<p><a href=""http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_store_batteries"" rel=""nofollow"">Battery University</a> has some general information on storing batteries. Relevant points:</p>

<ul>
<li>Storing a Li-ion battery in a discharged state will permanently damage it</li>
<li>Storing a Li-ion battery at 100% charge is less than optimal</li>
<li>around 40% charge is optimal for storage</li>
<li>Lower temperatures are better</li>
<li>Freezing is bad</li>
</ul>

<p>Leaving the battery connected to the radio or the charger might discharge it slowly due to leakage currents. Normally manufacturers try to minimize this, but there is always some leakage in solid-state devices. Given the cheapness of Baofeng, I doubt they put much engineering into this aspect.</p>

<p>Given that cold temperatures are favorable, the refrigerator would be a good place. Put in in a sealed, heavy plastic bag to buffer against moisture. To avoid problems with condensation, don't open the bag or use the battery until it's had time to come back to ambient temperature. Definitely avoid any place in the sun or that gets hot like a car.</p>

"Why are FM radio waves less susceptible to interference than AM?","530","","<p>When studying modulation of radio waves (or of most electromagnetic waves for that matter) I came across this question:</p>

<p><strong>Why are FM waves less susceptible to interference than AM waves?</strong></p>

<p>I know that in FM the frequency has been modulated to carry the signal by superimposing the signal wave to the carrier wave and for AM the amplitude has been varied by a similar process.</p>

<p>However, what I don't understand is why FM radio waves are less susceptible to interference.</p>

<p>Is it because when two waves interfere it is easier to change the amplitude as compared to the frequency, if so why?</p>
","<p>The waves (to be correct: the <em>signals</em>) are exactly as suspectable to noise for both modulations!</p>

<p>What's different is the receiver:</p>

<p>As the name suggests, Amplitude Modulation (AM) works by taking the input (audio) signal, and using its strength, to modify the amplitude of your carrier wave. The AM receiver hence only has the amplitude of the received signal to recover the original audio.</p>

<p>In Frequency Modulation (FM), the input signal's amplitude is used to change the <em>frequency</em> of the carrier wave. The receiver then tries to detect the frequency changes, and reconstruct the original audio signal as the change in frequency observed.</p>

<p>The absolute strength of the received signal hence doesn't matter for FM, and is the only thing relevant for AM.</p>

<p>Now, noise as we usually look at it, is <em>additive</em>, meaning that it changes the receive signal amplitude. Hence, AM is especially badly suited to deal with noisy channels (a <em>channel</em> in signal theory is everything that happens to a signal between transmitter and receiver).</p>

<p><hr>
<strong>Edit:</strong> Your questions continue:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I see, and is there a particular reason why noise only seems to affect aplitude? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>physics. Noise is ""random"" energy that changes the observed voltage with a positive or negative sign. It adds to the signal. Really, just simple addition of voltages.</p>

<p>By the way, as I said, this goes for <strong>additive</strong> noise. There's <em>other</em> types of noise, but luckily, we're technically able to avoid a lot of those, so you don't have to worry about these (much harder to compensate) types of noise. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If two waves of different frequency superimpose shouldn't the frequency of the resulting wave differ to that of the original one? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. That doesn't happen. There's intermodulation in non-linear components, but that doesn't change the frequency, it merely creates new frequencies.</p>

<p>Now, if you have a strong interferer, your FM receiver might ""lock"" onto that instead of the station you actually want to listen to. But that's interference, not noise.</p>

<p>Also, if Noise power related to signal power (1/SNR) gets too high, your receiver might not be able to estimate the ""instantaneous"" frequency of the signal within the noise – then you get garbage out. But that implies a really bad reception.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Doesn't interference with noise </p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Interference</em> and <em>Noise</em> are two different things. Please don't mix the terms. Interference is someone else interfering.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>suggest superposition with waves of all kinds of frequencies?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. Noise is a random process and as such doesn't necessarily have a frequency. Many types (but far from all types!) of noise we consider are modelled to be <em>white</em>, ie. statistically contain the same amount of energy at all frequencies (if you take the spectrum of a theoretical, inifinitely long observation of noise). But that doesn't mean that your instantaneous noise realization contains a specific set of frequencies. That's the difference between statistics and events: If you have a chance of $10^{-7}$ to win the lottery jackpot of 10 Million € every week, it doesn't mean that you'll get 1€ every week.</p>

"Adapting an antenna coupler","524","","<p>I've built <a href=""http://www.aa5tb.com/coupler.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">AA5TB's antenna coupler</a>:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zmjIo.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I left out C2 because I didn't understand why I would need it - why would I? It works fine without.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, when I started tuning for a 5W 20m transceiver, the LED was on all the time. I then measured with a multimeter the AC voltage over the LED, and tuned to its minimum, about 3.2V~. The maximum was about 4.2V~. I was thinking of changing R4 and/or R5 so that these extremes are  a bit lower. Is that the right way to do this? I'm worried, because I'd say the resistance of the whole R4-R5-D2 circuit should be about 51 Ohm, like the other resistors. Or would adding C2 resolve this issue?</p>
","<p>C2 removes the AC component across the LED, and prevents the LED from being on when the antenna is matched to 50 ohms. You say the circuit works anyway -- probably at QRP levels it's not bright enough to see. I bet if you try it in a dark room, or with a higher power transmitter, you will see it.</p>

<p>Anyway, consider how this circuit works. Here's a simplified version which makes the antenna impedance more explicit, and lacks any sort of visible indicator:</p>



<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/oaBSI.png"" alt=""schematic""></p>



<p><sup><a href=""/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2foaBSI.png"">simulate this circuit</a> &ndash; Schematic created using <a href=""https://www.circuitlab.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">CircuitLab</a></sup></p>

<p>This is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheatstone_bridge"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wheatstone bridge</a>. V1 is your transmitter, and the antenna is the resistor of unknown value ($R_{ant}$).</p>

<p>Think of it this way: $R_1$ and $R_3$ form a voltage divider, and $R_2$ and $R_{ant}$ form another. </p>

<p>D1, C1, and R5 make a peak detector. If $R_{ant} &lt; R_3$, then on the positive cycle of V1, the voltage at A is greater than the voltage at B, and C1 charges through D1 to the peak difference.</p>

<p>If $R_{ant} &gt; R_3$, then on the negative cycle of V1, the voltage at B is more negative than at A, and again C1 charges through D1.</p>

<p>But if $R_{ant} = R_3$ (50Ω, our target impedance), then there is no voltage between A and B, and so D1 can never be forward biased, and so C1 can have no voltage across it, except for a small AC component via R5. The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC_time_constant"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">time constant</a> of C1 and R5 make a filter with a cutoff frequency of</p>

<p>$$ f_c = \frac{1}{2\pi R C} = \frac{1}{2 \pi (10\:\mathrm k\Omega) (10\:\mathrm{nF})} \approx 1600\:\mathrm{kHz} $$</p>

<p>This is so low far below the frequency of V1 that we can consider the AC component of the voltage across C1 to be zero. Instead, it appears across R5.</p>

<p>So now, look back to your circuit with the LED. It is connected across R5, which has some RF voltage across it all the time. When C1 is charged because the antenna isn't 50Ω then there is additionally some DC component, and it's really this DC component that we are interested in. Remember, a capacitor looks like a low impedance at higher frequencies, so by adding C2, you are effectively shunting any RF current around the LED, so that the LED sees only the DC component.</p>

<p>An alternate solution to this problem is to connect the LED across C1, like this:</p>



<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hBwQH.png"" alt=""schematic""></p>



<p><sup><a href=""/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fhBwQH.png"">simulate this circuit</a></sup></p>

<p>For that matter, why bother with two diodes when you already have one? An LED doesn't make a great RF rectifier, but I bet it works well enough at HF in this application. In fact, with one less diode drop of voltage I bet it's even more sensitive. We don't really need the capacitor since an LED flickering at 14 MHz looks just the same:</p>



<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Jkzb.png"" alt=""schematic""></p>



<p><sup><a href=""/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2f5Jkzb.png"">simulate this circuit</a></sup></p>

<p>Adjust the value of R4 to get the right LED brightness for your transmitter power.</p>

<p>One might ask why AA5TB's design is the way it is, and I'm guessing it's because <a href=""http://www.gqrp.com/resistive_swr_bridge.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">that's how someone else did it</a>, and the design was just copied with minor modifications. R4 and R5 together used to be a potentiometer. The arrangement of connected the LED to ground instead of point B (thus requiring C2) is probably because the LED used to be a meter. If you have a meter with a metal casing, and you are building this in a metal box, it may be easier to connect the meter to ground than to isolate it from the enclosure. With an LED you have no such restrictions.</p>

"What does a SSB signal look like?","523","","<p>I don't really get it. How is it possible to just send upper or lower side of a band (SSB USB/LSB):
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uoJG4.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>And how is it possible to send anything without the carrier wave!</p>

<p>If I have misunderstood anything I am sorry because I am new to this and would like a answer.</p>
","<p>It looks like you are confused about what these graphs represent. Here's the diagram you used in the question:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uoJG4.gif"" alt=""""></p>

<p>Probably, this diagram is intended to be interpreted with the horizontal axis being time, and the vertical axis representing voltage or current.</p>

<p>Using that same representation, then SSB looks like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/onLV2.png"" alt=""sine wave""></p>

<p>For comparison, AM looks like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/onLV2.png"" alt=""sine wave""></p>

<p>and FM looks like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/onLV2.png"" alt=""sine wave""></p>

<p>In fact, they all mostly look the same. Why? In these images, we can only see about 5 cycles of the carrier. While the carrier is modulated somehow, the highest frequencies in the baseband signal (your voice) are usually much lower than the carrier frequency. So although the amplitude or frequency may be changing, we can't see any significant changes over such a short span of time.</p>

<p>These images, because the X axis represents time, are said to be <em>time domain</em> representations.</p>

<p>However, one thing we know from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_analysis"" rel=""noreferrer"">Fourier analysis</a> is that we can also represent any periodic signal in the <em>frequency</em> domain. We can represent that graphically by making the Y axis frequency instead of time.</p>

<p>To illustrate, we can look at a square wave in the time domain ($f$), and see how it can be represented in the frequency domain ($\hat f$):</p>

Barbosa</a> - Own work. Licensed under Public Domain via <a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikimedia Commons</a>.</p>

<p>We don't usually use square waves in radio communications because they have power spread over a wide range of frequencies. A square wave at 1 MHz also has energy at all the odd harmonics, 3 MHz, 5 MHz, 7 MHz, and so on. This would cause a lot of interference, since each station is typically allocated just a small channel in which to transmit. Broadcast FM, for example, is allocated a channel 200 kHz wide, and all their transmitted power has to fit in that. For example, from 89.7 MHz to 89.9 MHz.</p>

<p>Consequently, most transmissions look more or less like sine waves, since a sine wave has all its power at exactly one frequency. Then we vary the amplitude or frequency of this wave to carry information, but at a relatively slow rate compared to the frequency of the carrier.</p>

<p>Once you understand the concept of looking at signals not as a function of time, but as a function of frequency, then it is easy to say what SSB looks like: it looks just like the baseband signal (your voice), but shifted up in frequency to wherever the transmitter is tuned.</p>

<p>As an example, a whistle is approximately a pure sine wave. So if you whistle at 1kHz into the microphone, and the transmitter is tuned to 1MHz, then what you will see transmitted is a pure sine wave at 1.001 MHz (1 MHz + 1 kHz). If you make no sound at all, then nothing is transmitted.</p>

<p>If you get two people whistling at different frequencies, say 1 kHz and 2 kHz, then what you will see is the sum of two sine waves, one at 1.001 MHz and another at 1.002 MHz. Because these two frequencies are so close together, if we view it on any timescale where we can see the individual oscillations of the transmitter, it will just look like a sine wave.</p>

<p>So it doesn't really make much sense to think about what SSB looks like in the time domain, and consequently, most of the graphics you see represent the signal in the frequency domain.</p>

","<p>No, this would not be possible unless you were to program a PIC chip to switch the radio to the call channel, which would be set to the <code>144.930 MHZ</code> APRS frquency when it heard an APRS brap from the TT. It would then have to switch the radio back when the APRS had been sent. Still, It would be VERY tricky because the PIC would only be switching the radio when it heard the APRS, not before. So, unless you could have the TT start transmitting but wait one second to send the APRS so the PIC could switch the TT, it would not work.</p>

"CW contact content","513","","<p>I received my license and built and tested my first CW transceiver. I've spent the last weeks learning Morse code. Now, time has come to make the first contact.</p>

<p>But what is a typical CW contact? When you've found each other, what information is typically communicated and in what order? </p>

<p>Or isn't there something like a format? </p>
","<p>Didn't you need to study basic contact procedure for your license? </p>

<p>In any case, my advice for situations such as these is simple: Listen! </p>

<p>Since you have a transceiver, just listen and try to find QSOs where you can hear both sides of the conversation, listen to them, copy down all information they send and try to analyze it. This will help you familiarize yourself with local operating customs, so you'll have a good answer for your immediate location. There's also <a href=""http://websdr.ewi.utwente.nl:8901/"">this</a> SDR site, whose receiver shouldn't be too far away from you (in SW terms at least). </p>

<p>If you want some ""generic"" advice, look up QSO templates. You mentioned that you practiced code, so you should already be a bit familiar with them. If you aren't, do practice them! It will make things much easier than if you haven't.</p>

<p>Once you get the basic template, the rest is just listening. Some people may want to just ""rubber stamp"" QSOs, other people may want to have longer conversations, so that's something that you need to prepare for by listening. This way, you can get to know the locals who are often on the band, before actually establishing communication with them.</p>

<p>If you really want another one of those QSO templates, I'll try to provide one with comments along the way.</p>

<p><code>QRL?</code></p>

<p>Then you want for a while, to see if you're emitting on a frequency that's already in use. If there's no response, move to next step.</p>

<p><code>QRL?</code></p>

<p>Once again, ask if the frequency is in use and listen for a couple of tens of seconds.</p>

<p><code>QRL?</code></p>

<p>If nobody responds, you can start calling CQ. </p>

<p><code>CQ CQ CQ DE YU1NKA YU1NKA YU1NKA K</code></p>

<p>Point of the CQ is to draw attention to yourself and not to the fact that you're calling CQ. What the other side wants to hear is your callsign. Depending on your callsign, it might be a bit difficult to copy on the first try. Then wait for a while and see if anyone is responding. If not, call again. Repeat this step until someone does respond, but do keep in mind that you need to leave enough time between your calls for someone to actually respond. </p>

<p>So let's assume that someone heard the CQ and wants to respond. He'll go something like this:</p>

<p><code>YU1NKA DE AA1BBB AA1BBB K</code></p>

<p>Important point for the other guy is to send your callsign, so that you can recognize that he's talking to you and to send his callsign, so that you can copy it. Some people may send callsign only once, or they may do it several times. After that, there's the end of relation sing. Some people send K, some send KN, some may send AR. In any case, these procedural signs are send without a space between letters, that is, as if they are just one letter.</p>

<p>At this point, the ""connection"" is established and it's up to you to respond. So here's my example again:</p>

<p><code>AA1BBB DE YU1NKA GM OM TNX FER CALL UR 599 599 QTH BELGRADE BELGRADE BT NAME ANDREJA ANDREJA BT HW CPY? AR AA1BBB DE YU1NKA KN</code></p>

<p>So in this part, it's important to send the procedural information, such as report, location and name, which are usually send in that order. The BT (sometimes written as =) prosign is often used as a sort of spacer between different sections of a QSO. I've seen some people use full stop there as well, but BT is a bit faster to type. Note some abbreviations used here as well. O is quire a bit longer than E, so in some cases such short-hands are used as a from of ""TXT speak"" which allows faster sending. Often, in the report, letters will be used instead of numbers. There's a whole set of equivalences between letters and numbers, but the most popular seems to be N for 9, so you may see report sent as 5NN. Near the end of relation, you should ask for the same procedural information from the other side. Sometimes, just HW? is used to ask for report. </p>

<p>Then the other side will reply something like:</p>

<p><code>YU1NKA DE AA1BBB R GD OM UR RPRT 5NN 5NN BT QTH EXAMPLETOWN EXAMPLETOWN BT NAME BOB BOB AR YU1NKA DE AA1BBB KN</code></p>

<p>With this part, the formal start of the conversation is over. Do note the R used here. It's used to show that you copied whole previous relation. Now you can talk about whatever you want, if the other side is also interested. Some people may skip this part.</p>

<p><code>AA1BBB DE YU1NKA R BLA BLA MY TRX IS BLA BLA MY ANT IS BLA BLA BLA WX IS BLA BLA BLA I LIKE WRITING HAM.SE ANSWERS AT 4 AM IN THE MORNING BLAH BLAH BLAH AR BK</code></p>

<p>Some people may just send BK at the end of a relation instead of sending full callsigns. Just keep in mind how often you're required to identify yourself when you're doing something like this. </p>

<p>Finally, there's the conclusion part. In this part, you usually send best wishes, wish for another QSO soon, wish for good DX or something like that and you  end the conversation. Sometimes people may throw in a word or two in the language used in the country of the person you're talking to, if you happen to know them. Also it may be a good place to negotiate sending of QSL cards, if that's something you're into.</p>

<p>So the end would look like this:</p>

<p><code>AA1BBB DE YU1NKA R OK TNX DR BOB FER ALL BT WILL SEND QSLL VIA BURO BURO BT HPE TO CU AGN ES ALL BEST FER U ES UR FAMILY IN 2015 BT TNX FER QSO 73 SK AA1BBB DE YU1NKA CL</code></p>

<p>Here again, we have R, to show that whole last relation came through. Next, I mention that I'll send my QSL card (do note QSLL) through QSL bureau and I wish all the best in the new year and thank for the QSO. In the end, we have 73, which is commonly used. Then there's the procedural part. I send SK, meaning that I'm ending the conversation and I send CL, meaning that I'm closing down my station. </p>

<p>The other side will provide a similar transmission. Sometimes, at the very end, people will send E E and E after the final official relation. Sometimes other people listening to the conversation may also send E E as well as a sort of informal greeting. </p>

"How much voltage is on a typical high power (1000mw) 2.4Ghz WiFi antenna?","511","","<p>According to this sales listing for a 2.4Ghz antenna, it can handle up to 20 watts of power but has an impedance of 50 ohms. </p>

<p>That means that (at 20 watts), the input would need to be at more than 50 volts to keep the heat generated to be less than 8 watts</p>

<p>20 watts / 50 volts = 0.4 amps</p>

<p>0.4 amps ^ 2 * 50 ohms = 8 watts of heat</p>

<p>50 volts is enough to shock someone (and that's probably a low estimate)</p>

<p>Am I missing something here?</p>
","<p>The answer is ""it depends"".</p>

<p>It depends on the Antenna design, but lets look at an example:</p>

<p>A typical (license free / home / consumer) installation of WiFi is 100mW (not a 1000mW as your post indicates)</p>

<p>A typical antenna has a 50 Ohm impedance, and lets take an example:</p>

<p>For a 1/4 wave vertical antenna the voltage distribution has a voltage minimum at feed point, and a voltage maximum at the end. And lets take that this antenna has a perfect Resistance part of the complex Impedance = 50 + 0j Ohm (in practice this may vary a lot)</p>

<p>Ohm's Law will show you E = SQRT(P*R) = SQRT(0.1*50) = 2.23 V (at the antenna tip)</p>

<p>This is only true for the standard quarter-wave vertical, other antenna designs may have different voltage distribution.</p>

<p>An antenna may have a rating of ""20 W"" but that only indicates the maximum power input possible with that antenna before ""things go bad"". </p>

<p>You will have to check local legislation on what the maximum power is you may run, but as indicated above in many regions of the world this is 100mW (YMMV)</p>

<p>Often this is expressed in ERP, so it will take antenna gain into account. Example: If your antenna has a unity gain of 3dB, then you need to ensure that the transmitter (the WiFi Router) is throttled back to 50mW in order to be compliant with a 100mW-ERP legislation. This assumes no cable loss, so the actual calculation will be more complex taking cable loss / connector loss into account.</p>

"Hentenna beam...is it possible?","510","","<p>I did a (Amateur Radio) search for 'hentenna' and got not one hit. So, to boldly go where no man has gone before, I want to explore the strange new world of creating a beam antenna with <strong>Hentenna</strong> DE, with a reflector, most likely being a non-driven version of itself, and, to save wire and space, Yagi-type directors (rods)...maybe six of them.<br>
  This <strong>Hengi</strong> doesn't seem too different from a <strong>Quagi</strong>; though, because the Hentenna is a long rectangle <em>perpendicular to its polarization</em>, <strong>rod directors would be perpendicular to the Hentenna rectangles' long side</strong>.<br>
  I would approach it like the original 14ft., 2M Quagi. There are some ""Hengi"" beam antennas but they use 1 or 2 non-driven versions of the DE as directors. Would the <strong>perpendicular</strong> rods work like they do in Quagis and Yagis where they are more or less in the same plane as the DE?

</blockquote>

<p>I would take the following approach:</p>

<ul>
<li>Figure out why you want to do this, e.g. extra forward-gain, extra FB-ratio and write it down, compared to a much simpler design (such as a vertical yagi with the same lenght/elements) call this your ""success criteria""</li>
<li>Get a freeware (or paid for) antenna modelling program, there are various, such as <a href=""http://www.qsl.net/4nec2/?"">4NEC2</a> or <a href=""https://www.eznec.com/"">EZNEC</a>, and familiar yourself with the workings. There are others as well, these are the two which simply jump to mind for me.</li>
<li>Model your design in the program, experiment with element positions, size, height, length, until you have a good idea if you can get close to your ""success criteria""</li>
<li>Once happy with the modelling, build your design, and test.</li>
<li>If you want you can build a reference antenna (such as a yagi) and compare the two antenna's. </li>
</ul>

<p>Lastly I would advice: have some fun, and enjoy the modelling and building.</p>

<p>To answer your question:
I have no idea if your perpendicular rods work in the way you propose. I could not find any reference material, nor do I have experience with such. However as your question indicates, this is more an experiment for you then a theoretical question. </p>

<p>Saying that; there is an article describing a ""Hentenna Beam"" but slightly different than you propose. You can find this <a href=""http://www.hamuniverse.com/n5nns4elhentenna.html"">here</a>. It is not very scientific, but it might help you with your endeavours.</p>

"How does aluminum siding on a house affect an inverted-vee antenna next to it?","508","","<p>My two-storey house is wood with alumninum siding.  I had wanted to install an inverted-vee antenna with its midpoint hanging from the eave, and endpoints near the ground, but this would place the wire of the antenna about a foot from the siding.  The wall of the house at that point is perpendicular to a line in the direction of Japan.  I live in Washington state.</p>

<p>My question is, how much is the siding going to affect the performance of the antenna?  Would the siding act as a kind of reflector, so I could hear Japanese stations better than New York City stations?  Or would it adversely affect all signals?</p>
","<p>It's very difficult to predict. If your siding were an infinite, perfectly conducting plane, then the results would be the same as if you had another inverted V, positioned as if mirrored through the plane of the siding, but fed in antiphase. This is called an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_antenna"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">image antenna</a>.</p>

<p>What this does depends on the distance between your antenna and the siding. It's not unlike the problem of a <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/a/487/218"">dipole over ground</a>.</p>

<p>Here's the rub: your siding isn't infinite, and it isn't perfectly conductive. The geometry is going to significantly change the result. You might get some result by putting the measurements precisely into a modeling system like EZNEC, but short of that it's hard to say.</p>

<p>An inverted V isn't a very directional antenna to begin, so it's not too productive worrying about how it's going to affect the pattern. It will probably significantly affect the <em>tuning</em> of your antenna. And, this siding is going to have some significant RF currents in it. If it's lossy, because it's not conductive, it's also going to degrade the efficiency of your antenna.</p>

<p>But, if this is the only good place you have to put an antenna, it will work. I doubt the losses will be too huge, if you can get it to tune. That's probably the hard part. Will it tune? Again, really hard to say. Wire antennas are cheap. The easiest thing to do is try it and see.</p>

"How do I select a programmed memory scan on the Yaesu FT-897D?","506","","<p>The Yaesu FT-897D has a so-called “Programmable Memory Scan (PMS)” feature, which allows limiting scanning to a user-defined band by creating special paired memory entries which set the upper and lower frequency bounds.</p>

<p>I've used it successfully on the first programmed band (M-P1L to M-P1U), but I can't figure out how to select a different programmed band to scan. I've tried selecting M-P1L before entering PMS mode and it just goes to PMS-1 instead of PMS-2, and none of the controls <em>in</em> PMS mode change bands that I've noticed.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.yaesu.co.uk/files/FT-897D%20Operating%20Manual.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">The manual</a> on page 50 discusses how to enable PMS but not how to change bands. Searching for advice on the web only turned up <a href=""http://www.eham.net/ehamforum/smf/index.php?topic=82545.0"" rel=""nofollow"">this rather annoyed person's workaround</a> of SKIPping the memories other than the one to use, which can't possibly be how it's supposed to work.</p>
","<p>The PMS pairs interact with tuning similarly to the built-in band limits. Use the usual tuning controls (MEM/VFO CH or DIAL) to go past an end — higher than M-PxU or lower than M-PxL — and the transceiver will switch to the next or previous PMS pair.</p>

<p>As far as I've found, this is the <em>only</em> way to change between PMS pairs. Pressing the BAND buttons will <em>not</em> do so, and will merely disable PMS and change bands normally.</p>

<p>If you leave and re-enter PMS mode the last used PMS pair will be remembered, but the VFO will be reset to the M-PxL frequency.</p>

<p>I'm not directly involved with Amateur Radio, but have friends who are. They're always by the book. The book is right. period. With amateur radio, if you even ask whether something is within the rules, you get shot down and threatened with government reports. I've seen this in person, even on <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/questions/2318/when-is-aprs-use-considered-commercial?newreg=1dec0e22e42f41019ed7995528bddee2"">this very forum.</a></p>

</blockquote>

<p>To me, that comes across as extremely hostile. The question is a fair one in my mind. The difference between ""legal"" and ""potentially illegal"" is so minute, and the reaction is entirely disproportional, but from my experience, the norm!</p>

<p>Most hobbies aren't nearly as strict. If you want to use 80 grit sandpaper instead of 60, or drive 110 instead of 100, no one cares. Absolutely no one would report you to a federal agency for not wearing a mask painting, or using a double instead of an int. </p>

<p>I'm intrigued by amateur radio, but scared of attitudes like the one above. Could someone explain why these attitudes exist?</p>
","<p>I think there are two parts to this; why are they so ""anal"" /strict / uptight   about the rules?   why are they so hostile / aggressive / generally unpleasant?</p>

<p>The first part I think is due to something that most people don't appreciate.  The Ether (if you'll excuse the name) is a shared resource.  The rules are there to try to let us all use it as effectively as possible.  If people don't follow them it is easy for a few people to cause a lot of inconvenience to many others.  Because they had to show an understanding of this principle in order to be granted a licence, most hams (excuse again pls) try to adhere to the rules and expect / exhort others to do the same.</p>

<p>Some hams overreact to other peoples failure to follow the rules.  Partly this is simply a personality factor.  In other areas this appears - road rage affects some drivers, while most people just ignore bad driving by others; on the forums such as this, some people overreact in ludicrously offensive ways to posts they think are at fault in some way.  The distance created by radio, the internet or being in separate sealed cabins has a slightly disinhibiting effect on people, so that they are more likely to vent their spleen in these situations than they would in normal personal contacts.</p>

<p>Since hams may have spent a lot of time and effort to gain their licence and a lot more time, effort and money setting up their station (as the jargon has it), this quite literally ups the ante.  They have a lot invested in this activity and it is hardly surprising that their reaction to ignorant, inconsiderate or even malicious interference is exacerbated.</p>

<p>And of course it is the people who have got excited about an issue who are most likely to respond to you.</p>

<p>I also play Bridge and although most people one plays against are pleasant, courteous, even convivial, at every club I've been to there are always some who cannot get through an evening without being unnecessarily aggressive, offensive or just unpleasant.  Now you can hardly think of a more genteel environment, but this sort of behaviour still happens.</p>

<p>I hope this answer is acceptable, as I see now that it does not conform to the forum standards, in that it expresses opinions and does not cite sources.  If required I can cite sources for the rules, but most other matter is based on my experience as a radio amateur since 1976 and as a human being since 1949.</p>

<p>There are likely to be a lot of possible answers that are art and style rather than one ""right"" answer, so some possible parameters.  Let me know if this still ends up too vague.</p>

<ul>
<li>Technician or General class.</li>
<li>Voice (aka phone), rather than CW highly preferred.</li>
<li>Without a repeater, or at least not one for at least several hundred miles. e.g. Western Washington to California (800+) or Idaho. (500-600)</li>
<li>Any suggested bands/frequencies where I might find someone willing to call a landline on my behalf?  I'm familiar with UHF and VHF calling frequencies - I can look up calling equivalent freqs once I settle on a band.</li>
<li>Portable.  Something I can pack up and take, rather than needing a permanent or very bulky antenna installation or base station. I'm wondering if, matching the other constraints, there's an option for a coiled wire antenna that I can effectively throw up a tree.  Ultra portable station - car mobile size would be ideal. I'd likely have a lot of other stuff with me.</li>
<li>Common battery types - ideally 12v off the car.  I'm unclear on the wattage I'd need for, say 500-600 miles simplex.  100-150w seems like starting to stretch the limits on a car inverter, so I may have to look for a generator based solution.</li>
<li>Economical.  I may be just into the realm of pipe-dreams here, but at some point the cost would make satellite phone solutions more practical. I'm okay with low-end solutions (aka 'junk brands') - a disposable solution means I'm more likely to have it with me when I need it, rather than sitting at home in a padded case.</li>
<li>My focus is mainly on CERT short-term solutions during an event like the Cascadia subduction fault, rather than ""end of the world"" long term ""find the survivors.""</li>

<p>Satellite phones are certainly the most purpose built option here, but pricey. Ideally I'd like a solution that I might use for other things - possibly as an excuse to start getting into HF...</p>

<p>Thanks in advance - WE7MOR.</p>
","<p>When establishing emergency communications in a disaster, the natural choice of band is one that will allow you to communicate out of the disaster zone.  Given the scenario you describe, a massive earthquake affecting the West Coast of North America from Northern California to British Columbia, that probably means HF.  HF privileges with a US Technician license are limited, so Technician-class licensees preparing for this scenario would do well to upgrade.</p>

<p>There are many fine HF radios that are very portable.  Almost all of the more-portable HF rigs are powered by 12 VDC, so no need for an inverter (unless you need one for a computer).  The smallest and most portable HF radios are meant for QRP operation, 5 &ndash; 10 W, but for emergency communications 100 W would be better.  There are several radios that are sized to be installed in a vehicle that cover HF to UHF; one of those radios would be excellent for your purpose.  There are also many fine HF radios, some of which include VHF and UHF, that are a little larger but still quite portable.</p>

<p>The antenna is more problematic; generally speaking, your goals of being very portable and easy to set up conflict with the goal of being an efficient radiator.  I assume that you also want a multi-band antenna, because you would probably prefer 20m &ndash; 10m in the daytime, and 40m &ndash; 80m at night.  (Many of the regional HF nets are on 80m.)  Here are some antennas to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Long wire: a long wire, typically at least 40 m / 130 ft, up high in the trees, connected to an antenna tuner.  Advantages: inexpensive; easy to build from whatever wire is on hand; multi-band.  Disadvantages: needs lots of wire, must be up high, RF in the shack problems, external antenna tuner required, may not tune on all bands.</p></li>
<li><p>G5RV / ZS6BKW: a popular but often-misunderstood wire antenna that includes a section of ladder-line feed.  Can be homebrewed or purchased.  Advantages: inexpensive; multi-band.  Disadvantages: works very poorly on some bands; needs to be up high for best performance; requires a balun and an antenna tuner.</p></li>
<li><p>Off-center-fed ""Windom"": another popular but misunderstood wire antenna.  Advantages: inexpensive; multi-band.  Disadvantages: performance varies, quality of the balun is crucial; requires a balun and an antenna tuner; needs to be up high for best performance.</p></li>
<li><p>Loop: a wire antenna that makes a big horizontal loop, supported by trees.  Advantages: inexpensive; multi-band.  Disadvantages: requires an antenna tuner; needs to be up high for best performance; may not tune up on all bands.</p></li>
<li><p>Commercially-made vertical: I'm speaking of commercially-made multi-band vertical antennas that when assembled are 8 &ndash; 12 m / 26 &ndash; 40 ft long. Generally comes in a box that's about 1.5 m / 5 ft long.  Advantages: no need for trees; multi-band; often doesn't require a tuner.  Disadvantages: not as portable; more expensive; requires wire radials laid on the ground; low angle of radiation, which is generally better for long-range communications than intermediate-range.</p></li>
<li><p>Car-mounted vertical.  Advantages: if your solution is a mobile radio, than a car-mounted antenna is probably already connected.  Disadvantages: efficiency ranges from bad to terrible, depending on the band, how large the antenna is, and how much you're willing to spend; some models are quite expensive.</p></li>
<li><p>Backpacker vertical (my term): a vertical antenna that is meant to be as portable as possible.  Homebrew designs and commercial varieties exist.  Advantages: no trees required; very portable; antenna tuner generally not needed.  Disadvantages: flimsy; radials required; may not be able to handle 100 W; efficiency is generally low; some of the commercial models are surprisingly expensive.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>To summarize the antennas, if the antenna is to be efficient, multi-band, and portable, then we're probably talking about a wire antenna <em>up high</em> (generally at least 1/4 &lambda;).  Unfortunately, I've found that most hams just can't throw a rock attached to a cord very high, so you may wish to consider a tool to help you get the wire over the tree limb.  I use an arborist throw bag and a water-balloon slingshot.</p>

<p>Many of the wire antennas require an antenna tuner.  Many radios include antenna tuners, but many built-in antenna tuners have limited range.  An external antenna tuner generally has a better tuning range.</p>

<p>Your question is rather open-ended, so I'll stop now, rather than talking about modes, power sources, and other considerations.  I will say that if you want to use ham radio in an emergency, you should get your equipment ready and practice the techniques beforehand.  Also keep in mind that in a wide-ranging disaster, there will be a very large need for emergency communications; you might want to think about joining your local ARES group so that you can help other people too.</p>

<p>What common methods/software exist for obtaining this kind of data?</p>
","<p>Without a lot of information on the person's testing methodology, I'll assume that dBS9/dBm refer to the signal strength received by the radio the antenna being tested is attached to.</p>

<p>There are several different ways to interpret what's in the graph.
You could ask ""For a given antenna length, which antenna performs best"" (look at the cluster around 15 inches for example), in which case it would be the one that gives the highest dBS9/dBm.</p>

<p>You could also look at the graph as one of those cost/performance type graphs. If you define your criteria as ""short antenna and high dBS9/dBm"", then the best antennas would be towards the upper left portion of the graph while the worst ones would be in the lower right portion.</p>

<p>""Operating optimally"" requires you to define what ""optimally"" means, and this is going to be different for different circumstances. Do you want the highest dBm? Shortest antenna?</p>

<p>For just received signal strength, the ones you circled in red are great performers. Do you want to be carrying around a 35-45"" antenna with you though?</p>

<p>Conversely, the one circled in blue is a great antenna if you want something short, but receive performance kind of sucks.</p>

","<p>There is no minimum length; all else being equal, a shorter antenna (with the proper loading/matching) is just less efficient. Antenna efficiency is not a critical issue if the antenna is not being used for transmitting (and you do not have strong noise sources inside your vehicle).

<p>Your CB antenna is likely to remain the tallest no matter what you do. I would recommend investigating shortened CB antennas first, and worrying about the others only if you succeed in making it shorter than them.</p>

<p>The same Transmitter type is also used for switching wireless power plugs from the Arduino Device.</p>

<p>I am using <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00SO2EV8S"" rel=""nofollow"">antennas that are wound</a> with a diameter of approximately 0.4 cm and the length of the wire seems to be lambda/2.</p>

<p>Maybe someone can give me an advice how to extend the range of the system? Increasing the voltage of the transmitter is not possible.</p>
","<p>I'll begin by saying I do not have any first-hand experience with these transmitter receiver pairs.  But it seemed very interesting to me so I did a little bit of research to learn more about how they can be used.</p>

<p>My conclusion is that you probably will not see much improvement in the error-rate of data transmission by altering the existing antennas.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While I can control the power plugs two rooms further with no
  problems, receiving the sensor data from there is not possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reason that you find success controlling the power plugs is that the message is very simple (on or off) and there is some error checking built into the data protocol.  Also the on or off message is repeated many times with some unique data pattern that can be reliably distinguished from random data meaning that the receiver is smart at ignoring false messages due to random noise.</p>

<p>Similarly you could transmit data packets at a very slow rate, I'll guess at a rate of a few characters per second by using the same error-tolerant technique used for simple on/off messages.  You'd implement this with some unique code to indicate begin of data and also you'll need to send some sort of error checking code like a CRC after the data character.  The receiver software needs to throw away any characters that are not received with a valid CRC.</p>

<p>From <a href=""http://thegaragelab.com/wireless-communications-433mhz-modules/"" rel=""nofollow"">what I found in my research</a> you need to expect a very high error rate in data transmission of 90% error rate or even worse.  Your only way to conquer such a poor error rate is to repeat the message (or each data character) many times and have the receiver have some logic to know how to ignore erroneously received characters.</p>

<p>There is a code library called <a href=""http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/RadioHead/classRH__ASK.html"" rel=""nofollow"">RadioHead</a> that has a good protocol already coded so you do not need to begin with nothing.  One comment describing their protocol helps to understand how they solve the noisy data transmission error rate in their code: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Does not use the Arduino UART. Messages are sent with a training preamble, message length and checksum. Messages are sent with 4-to-6 bit encoding for good DC balance, and a CRC checksum for message integrity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You may ask yourself how or why such product can be marketed that are so unreliable as an error rate of worse than 90%.  The reason is they are using frequencies that are assigned to other licensed users.  So the cheap devices you use need to be tolerant of interference and also not interfere with the licensed users.  You need to write a software protocol to be tolerant of interference and already the modules you chose are not going to present much of a problem interfering with licensed users since the modules have a very low 25mW transmit power which is a very tiny level unlikely to bother your next door neighbor.</p>

<p>Alternatively you could adopt a more expensive transmitter and receiver technology like Bluetooth LE or XBEE where the modules already handle the error checking protocol for you so that you do not need to invent your own software error tolerant protocol.  The modules you have begun to use are very nice for their extremely low price, but like all things in engineering you trade one thing for another.  In this case the low cost brings more complexity in your application.  Keeping the cost down makes sense in mass production but maybe not so much for a single project.</p>

"Why isn't the mast an antenna?","487","","<p>A lot of ""big antenna"" pictures show these very tall masts being used to hold up a variety of other HF antennas.  The mast itself is almost always conductive, though, and I'm wondering why they aren't using it as an antenna.</p>

<p>AM stations use masts as antennas, so certainly this is done in the industry, but why do hams rarely, if ever, use the mast as an antenna? Are there examples of DIY mast-as-antenna designs?</p>

</ul>

<p>The magic words for Google are ""shunt fed tower"". Shunt feeds are most common, since most masts are grounded, and you can't series-feed an antenna if it's grounded at the base.</p>

<p>There certainly are towers that are isolated from ground, and are series fed, but securely attaching a tower to ground without connecting it has obvious disadvantages to cost and complexity. Consequently you will probably encounter them only among the most avid 160 and 80 meter users. <a href=""http://www.w8ji.com/transmitting%20antennas.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">W8JI</a> is a good example. For higher frequencies, a quarter-wave vertical can more cheaply just be a tube, since the structural demands are less.</p>

<p>As for why people put HF antennas on top of their towers that could be perfectly good HF radiators: usually the antennas at the top are directional: Yagis, quads, etc. Feeding the tower gets you an omnidirectional antenna which is great for broadcast, but not for DX hunting.</p>

"SSTV on repeaters?","485","","<p>Just a simple question and the answer is probably no, but am I allowed to transmit a picture using SSTV on an FM 2 meter or 70 centimeter repeater?</p>

<p>I am in the United States.</p>
","<p>Depends on the band plan and the repeaters operator. You wouldn't be violating any FCC rules, though, but if you're outside the US the answer may be different.</p>

<p>To expand on this, you are allowed to transmit any permitted mode on any permitted frequency your license is good for.  That frequency and mode happening to correspond to an open repeater another station operates does not preclude you from making your transmission.</p>

<p>However, as a licensee, you've agreed to cooperate with other operators to make the most efficient use of the spectrum provided.  This means that unless you have good reason to, or have coordinated with others, you generally follow the band plans in effect in your region.</p>

<p>Generally the band plans keep voice repeater and SSTV operations in separate frequencies.  However the band plan is a way to coordinate effort, and not a rigid standard.  As shown in <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/questions/894/conducting-a-slow-scan-television-net-via-an-fm-repeater"">this question</a>, there are may groups that regularly use repeaters to send SSTV signals.</p>

<p>If the repeater is regularly used by other operators for voice, or is in service to a community for emergency operations, weather spotting, or other frequent uses, you'd probably be better off not tying it up with SSTV images. It'll be really annoying to those that keep their HT on all the time to hear the SSTV coming through.</p>

<p>If it's a quiet repeater and happens to be in an SSTV portion of the band plan, I wouldn't even bother asking, just go ahead and send and see what the response, if any, is.</p>

<p>If it's outside the SSTV band plan, but appears to be an underutilized repeater, it's your call.  Asking might result in people saying 'no' without good reason, but doing it without getting explicit permission may irritate some. It may also intrigue others.</p>

<p>But, being honest with yourself, consider the question, ""Who is likely to be listening to this repeater with an SSTV receiver?""  If you're communicating specifically with someone who is set up to receive your images, direct communications isn't reasonable, and the repeater appears to be open and available for community use, I'd say go for it.  If you're just sending random images to no one in particular, though, or merely experimenting with the mode, you probably don't need to use the repeater to accomplish your goals.</p>

This was late enough for the sun to be coming up, but is it even possible to make the ""long path"" connection that far around? I would have thought Wake Island was totally in the dark at that time. More generally, what is an ideal situation for long path, and is it simply a matter of pointing 180 degrees away from the listed direction on QRZ.com?</p>
","<p>You are correct, the long path azimuth is simply 180 from the bearing listed in QRZ.</p>

"Why do concurrent FM signals not mix together?","484","","<p>Generally when I hear two conflicting signals they do not mix together, but rather one dominates then the other. This phenomenon can be observed on FM broadcast station when driving out of range from one station into the range of another. During the 'in between phase' they generally do not mix but rather one dominates and they flip flop being the dominant signal. Why is this?</p>
","<p>I understand why you think it should mix - that's what happens with SSB, for example. The difference with FM is that in FM, at any instant, each station's signal is only at one frequency. If you slowed the signals down and watched through a spectrum analyzer, you could watch the two signals, and you'd see two peaks at constant amplitude, moving independently. The frequency (of the carrier) is modulated based on the audio signal amplitude, so that peak will move within the channel, but it's always one peak. Your receiver latches on to the stronger peak, and that's what it decodes.</p>

<p>On the other hand, in single sideband, you wouldn't ever see a single peak no matter how much you slowed the signal down. In single sideband, the amplitude of the carrier is being modulated - it isn't that the peak is moving, the peak is actually being mixed with (multiplied by) the audio amplitude, so all the peaks from the audio signal would appear on your spectrum analyzer. In this case, there's no distinction between audio components coming from one source vs another - you could separate the signals if you wanted to using directional antennas, but with a single receiver all you're going to see is the two signals superimposed.</p>

"What are the general effects of a geomagnetic storm on propagation?","472","","<p>Per <a href=""http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/"">NOAA/NWS Space Weather Prediction Center</a>, ""SWPC Forecasters are anticipating G3 (Strong) Geomagnetic Storm conditions to occur January 9 and 10.""</p>

<p>What does that mean, very generally, for amateur radio communications?  Does it depend on the type of geomagnetic storm and how it hits us exactly, or are there general effects we can predict?  Does it increase or decrease propagation in all or some bands?</p>
","<p>Geomagnetic storms are the result of solar events that subsequently impact earth's ionosphere.  They are graded from G1 (the mildest) to G5 (most severe) and the grade can be derived from the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-index"" rel=""nofollow"">K-index</a> (one of the many solar related values published <a href=""http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">NOAA</a>).  A Kp index value of 5 equates to a G1 and a value of 9 equates to a G5.</p>

<p>The predicted G3 storm for tomorrow is classified as a <em>Strong</em> storm by NOAA's standards and is the result of a  Coronal Mass Ejection (CME).  CMEs are large clouds of plasma (ionized gases) that have been ejected from the surface of the sun. They are directional, and occur with some regularity, but are only a problem if the mass of particles heads our way.</p>

<p>When they do head our way and impact the ionosphere, they cause a number of changes.  Due to increased ionization of the lower levels of the ionosphere, signals between 2MHz and 30MHz will experienced increased absorption; if the storm is bad enough, that's 100% absorption.</p>

<p>Areas in the auroral zones are hardest it.  During these storms they can experience rapid
and deep signal fading due to the ionospheric irregularities that scatter the radio signal to the point that communication is impossible.</p>

<p>On frequencies above 30MHz, unexpected reflections of the radio waves by the ionosphere may cause radio interference. Ionospheric irregularities may produce fluctuating signals (a phenomenon known as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplanetary_scintillation"" rel=""nofollow"">scintillation</a>) and may distort the paths of radio waves. If strong enough, this can adversely impact phase-sensitive systems on frequencies above 1 GHz (e.g., the Global Positioning System; talk about potential mayhem). </p>

<p>Other effects include Auroral absorption, multipathing, and non-great-circle propagation.  One possible happy effect (for those living in the mid and upper latitudes) is that the auroral zone moves equatorward giving folks who are not normally able to experience the aurora a chance to see them.  And since propagation will be garbage, you may as well go outside and look.</p>

<p>Other effects that could be important: some minor impact on the power grid by inducing some voltage fluctuations. Spacecraft may observe some surface charging on satellite components, drag may increase on low-Earth-orbit satellites, and corrections may be needed for orientation problems.</p>

<p>Everything is analog, yet you can do digital things with the physics that is given to us.

</blockquote>

<p>Wifi, indeed, makes a few assumptions on the channel (ie. a microwave channel with 20 or 40 MHz width will behave differently than the much narrower, much lower, much noisier) channels you can get at shortwave, medium and longwave ranges  – how could you have 20 MHz of bandwidth if your center frequency isn't even that large?</p>

<p>So, no, Wifi itself can't work at these frequencies. Also, Wifi has to assume a bounded flight-time of signals to work efficiently. To top that up, large-area covering WiFi networks are a <em>bad idea</em><sup>TM</sup>, mainly because of the <em>hidden station problem</em>.</p>

<p>There's other techniques, but as soon as you think about it: Low-frequency spectrum simply is sparse because of the low frequency. Thus, to get sufficient bandwidth, you move to higher frequencies, which is why Cellular networks operate at 800 MHz and up. There simply was no spectrum available below.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All these frequency ranges have lower range of propagation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's an alternative fact. There's numerous long-range and space-ground links at frequencies much higher than that.</p>

<p>So, yes, while <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/q/3692/218"">Free Space Path Loss might be higher for increasing frequency</a>, antennas of a given size also get higher gain – and that makes all the microwave links that are the backhaul of a lot of the high-rate communication done today feasible.</p>

<p>P2P means Peer-to-Peer – I'm going to take that literally: It's not impossible to build a mesh network out of microwave links (in fact, that's what people do that operate cell phone towers over areas, and TV, towers on remote hilltops) and route stuff through that.</p>

<p>There's WiFi-based mesh networking – you might want to talk to your friendly <em>Freifunk</em> enthusiast about B.A.T.M.A.N.; but I still think that for long-distance mesh networks with links that are point-to-point, you'd probably want to do with a simple frequency division microwave link (ie. one center frequency for A->B and a different one for B->A) rather than a collision-avoidance based packet network (which has no advantages in a pure point-to-point, fixed terrestrial application).</p>

<p>You can rather easily build such a single link using (proper¹) SDRs that allow you to send arbitrary waveforms by calculating these in your PC, and do the inverse for reception. Using a network interface in your SDR application would allow you to plug together an IP network.</p>

<p>If you want to have omnidirectional rather than point-to-point links, you must share a single piece of spectrum across all users – which inherently divides the possible channel capacity by the number of users. You'll find, with a bit of consideration, that the easiest way to make the most of the spectrum that's available, is if there's a central node that everyone agrees on as controlling access timing – that way, for example, transmissions can be scheduled without the need for any ""dead periods"" in which stations have to listen to avoid colliding with others. If you do that, you'd be building some kind of TDMA base station, much akin to GSM / GPRS / EDGE (basically, in ascending order of flexibility in which time can be allocated to the stations) base stations. If you add the ability of base stations to communicate, and for user equipment to change between these, you've built a cellular network. Congrats!</p>

<p>If you don't need high rate (and, as Phil suggested) can live with half-a-century-old technology, the AX.25 packet radio technology might be an option – but certainly not for sharing any substantial files. AX.25 itself is horrible on many levels; it is especially bad-suited for networks, as there's no good network layer that is commonly used. APRS is often used atop of that to build what can best be described as a low-rate, sparse, very suboptimal, chaotic-good aligned, networking/relay system. It reduces the possible channel utilization by not having any awareness of routes, and thus would immediately break down if a couple of stations tried to continously use the channels at max rate for any substantial amount of time (or data).
So, that's definitely not a candidate for file sharing.</p>

<p>One check if your upconverter is functioning would be to tune to 0 MHz (with shift set) or 120 MHz (without shift set) and see if you see a big spike on the spectrum — that should be the upconverter's local oscillator.</p>

<li><p>Remember that HF is often a noisy environment, and you may have devices producing local noise. It's possible that everything is fine but you're only seeing the noise. Unplug the antenna — if the signal level drops all across the spectrum, then you know you <em>are</em> receiving successfully, you just are seeing the noise that's there. If nothing changes when you unplug the antenna, then you have an inadequate antenna, a nonfunctional upconverter, or you haven't managed to tune/shift to the right part of the spectrum.</p></li>

"FM radio in car gets interference from APRS beacon","468","","<p>The FM broadcast radio, factory installed in my car and usually tuned to 88.6 MHz, gets some interference from the 5W APRS transmitter on 144.800 MHz. It sounds like if the sensitivity of the broadcast FM receiver would go down a bit temporarily: more static FM noise is heard during the APRS ""brraaap"". The effect is more pronounced when I'm far away from my favourite station's transmitter and the signal is already weak. When I'm in town, it's barely noticeable.</p>

<p>The APRS transmitter has a properly mounted antenna (hole-through-roof, 1/4 wave vertical). The broadcast radio of the Volvo V70 does not have visible external antennas - there's one painted on the left trunk window, and apparently a second one embedded within the back right light assembly.</p>

<p>What can I do to fix this?</p>
","<p>There are a few ways the noise could be transmitted to the car radio, and the way to fix it will depend on how it's getting in there.</p>

<ol>
<li>Antenna</li>
<li>Power or ground</li>
<li>Other EMI</li>
</ol>

<p>If the transmission is swamping your radio's receiver, then it's not blocking the higher frequencies strongly enough. It might be worth looking at the output of the transmitter to see if it's broadcasting noise on other bands within the radio's region, and to take another transmitter that's not connected to the vehicle's power or ground and keying it up nearby.  If it disturbs the radio, then it's likely that the radio may need to be replaced.  Other options would be a different antenna.</p>

<p>If the transmission is coming through the power or ground, you might be able to add additional filtering and regulation at the radio.  This can be tested by attaching a dummy load to the transmitter while it's transmitting.  If the noise is present, it's likely EMI or power conduction.  Again, keying a separate radio outside the vehicle may narrow it down. Alternately, connect the APRS transmitter to a battery power supply and disconnect it from the car's power supply. It'll still be grounded to the car,  but it should narrow things down a little more.</p>

<p>EMI is a tougher one without a spectrum analyzer.  If the transmitter and radio are far apart, though, and each have their own metal case, it shouldn't be the cause.  I'd look for antenna and power problems first.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Find <em>any</em> continuous broadcast signal that has a carrier and you know the nominal frequency of, and adjust the PPM value until its peak in the spectrum display is centered on that frequency value.</p>

<p>The higher the frequency of the signal you are calibrating to, the more your local oscillator's error is magnified, so the more precise this eyeball procedure can be. (If you have a large error, it may be useful to start at a low frequency before moving up, so you don't have trouble finding the expected signal in band.) </p>

<p>Of course, it's only as good as the transmitter, which you don't know, but you can easily get it good enough for accurate tuning (as opposed to frequency measurement).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also, is this value frequency dependent? (How so?)</p>

<p>No. The physical oscillator generates a signal at a fixed frequency, and the tuned frequency is derived from that in a way which more or less involves counting — there is no systematic “analog” error in it.</p>

"What does a SSB frequency actually indicate?","467","","<p>An SSB signal is an AM signal with the carrier and other sideband filtered out, if I understand correctly.</p>

<p>As such, when specifying an SSB frequency do you specify the carrier frequency, then state which sideband, or do you specify the frequency the sideband is <em>actually</em> centered on?</p>
","<p>Normally in amateur radio when specifying a frequency you specify the nominal carrier frequency.</p>

<p>For SSB and other suppressed-carrier transmission modes, you specify the frequency to which the BFO needs to be tuned to re-insert the suppressed carrier. For this to work, you also need to specify which sideband you are transmitting on; lower, upper, or both. (Remember it's possible to have suppressed carrier double sideband, with identical or separate modulation of the sidebands.)</p>

<p>Even if you specified the center frequency rather than the suppressed-carrier frequency, you'd still need to specify which sideband you are modulating. If you get the sideband wrong, the audio will sound very strange because the demodulation will be inversed compared to the modulating signal. You can try this out for yourself by e.g. using USB to scan across the 7 MHz amateur radio band, where by convention the lower sideband is used.</p>

<p>For CW and other carrier-only transmission modes, it means that you specify the actual center frequency of your transmission. (It's a center frequency because the on/off keying causes sidebands to appear around the center frequency.) The receiver's actual BFO frequency is offset from this value by some amount, normally 400-700 Hz, to generate an audible tone at a reasonable frequency. Most modern transceivers allow you to configure the BFO offset for CW.</p>

<p>The above, combined with the fact that SSB often uses a 300-2700 Hz modulation passband, means that on SSB you normally aren't actually transmitting on the indicated frequency, only near it.</p>

<p>Note that other services may do things differently, and that channel-based amateur radio allocations may actually specify the center frequency rather than the BFO frequency. This is done e.g. for <a href=""https://www.fcc.gov/document/amateur-radio-service-5-mhz"">the 5 MHz amateur radio channels in the US</a>, which are legally specified as center frequencies with a maximum total transmission bandwidth.</p>

"How far does a watt equal in range in the FM band?","466","","<p>How many watts would be needed to cover a 10 mile radius with good sound for music on the 88-108 MHz FM broadcast band? 
I am an amateur and for fun only. </p>
","<p>This depends in your intended communication. Are you trying to hit a fixed receiver, in which case you can aim an antenna to that receiver? or are you trying to communicate with a handheld or other portable system? Are you on a portable system? Is the target system on a hill? The gain on the receive antenna, as well as the radiation pattern of your antenna makes a huge difference.</p>

<p>Additionally, the actual band used may make a difference. Many different bands permit FM operation, and some have unique properties that increase propagation distance.</p>

<p>Often, a 5w handheld with a rubber duck can hit a repeater ~10-20 miles away, but this is one particular example of possible communication.</p>

<h3>Edit:</h3>

<p>As you mentioned that you want good quality for music, you'll really need a more powerful transmitter.

<p>I'm not qualified to talk at length about the particulars of antenna design, but there are other resources online. For broadcast FM radio, you'll need an antenna (a) in a high location, so receivers can clearly receive your signal; (b) high power, usually on the order of kilowatts. (WCBN-FM, a student radio station in Ann Arbor MI, uses a 200W transmitter, but has an effective range of around 10 miles).</p>

"Why do some DX listen on a different frequency than they transmit on?","464","","<p>I've heard some DX indicate ""CQ up 5"" for instance, indicating that they are listening on a different frequency than they are transmitting on.</p>

<p>What are the reasons one might want to do that?</p>
","<p>This is called operating ""split"" and it takes a certain amount of skill to work a DX operator working split and even more to operate split.  </p>

<p>The reason this is done is to help manage the pileup. If too many stations are calling and the pileup becomes unmanageable it takes longer and longer to complete an exchange.  This is less fun for everyone.</p>

<p>By working split, the DX operator keeps his transmit frequency clear so that the callers will hear him well making the exchange go more smoothly.  He also has the opportunity to spread out the calling stations on several frequencies near his transmit frequency.  </p>

<p>For instance he starts out simplex, then gets spotted and the rush begins.  So he calls ""Up 5"" meaning call him on this frequency + 5KHz.  After a while he might announce ""Up 10"" and realistically at this point callers are spread from +3KHz to +12KHz or so in their eagerness to get through.</p>

<p>The DX station will go through the calling stations in some order (usually).  Perhaps starting at the top of the window and calling a station every 1KHz or every other KHz, or some other system.  The key to navigating these waters is to LISTEN for a while and figure out how it's being managed before jumping in.  This will greatly improve you odds of getting this guy in your log.</p>

","<p>Yes, you'll need an external tuner, unless your antenna is already matched sufficiently well to 50 ohms. The objective of the tuner is to transform the impedance seen by some signal source, like your radio, or the amplifier.</p>

<p>The amplifier will already be designed to have a 50 ohm input. Your radio, transmitting into that, is designed for a 50 ohm output, so there's no need for a tuner.</p>

<p>The amplifier will see your antenna impedance though the feedline, whatever that is. The amplifier is also designed for a 50 ohm load. If your antenna is sufficiently close to 50 ohms, then no tuner is necessary.

<p>This is a bit elliptical so I'll explain what I read from it (describing the receive-mode operation; transmit is just the reverse). There are <em>two</em> integrated LO/mixer units:</p>

<ul>
<li>One is in the RFFC5072 chip. This is the one that provides the HackRF One's wide tuning range. It mixes the incoming signal to an IF that is within the MAX2837's range. (I don't know whether that's fixed or adjusted for any reason.)</li>
<li>The MAX2837 chip then mixes that 2.x GHz IF down to baseband (as well as providing configurable gain and filtering).</li>
</ul>

<p>The baseband IQ signal from the MAX2837 is then sent to the MAX5864 ADC for conversion to digital samples, which are then sent to the host computer.</p>

<p>When transmitting, all of these stages operate in reverse; the MAX5864 works as a DAC instead of an ADC, and the same LOs and mixers are used.</p>

"Broadband antenna for SDR radio","457","","<p>I recently bought a very wideband SDR receiver (DX-Patrol MK4, declared covered frequencies are 100kHz-2GHz). I'm experimenting with antenna designs because unfortunately I live in an apartment building in the middle of the city and is not exactly an optimal spot for radio reception.</p>

<p>So far I got decent results on the VHF side with a small loop (around 1m diameter), a simple 1:1 balun (wire wrapped around a ferrite ring) and about 2m coax feedline. <strong>Since somebody asked: I have a feedline because I have access to a balcony.

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>fractional bandwidth of antennas</strong></p>

<p>Woah! 20 MHz is 200 times the frequency of 100 kHz. No, a loop antenna won't have that amount of bandwidth.</p>

<p>For antennas, we measure the bandwidth in <em>multiples of the center frequency</em>. For example, an antenna working well from 2.3 GHz to 2.5 GHz has a bandwidth of 200 MHz, with a center frequency of 2.4 GHz – that's a fractional bandwidth of $\frac{200\,\text{MHz}}{2400\,\text{MHz}} = \frac1{12}$.</p>

<p><strong>wideband antennas</strong></p>

<p>We tend to call antennas ""wideband"" as soon as their fractional bandwidth reaches $\frac15$. Really impressive wideband antennas reach fractional bandwidths of $\frac{11}{10}$ (UWB antennas) – and those really don't have the efficiency of an antenna you'd want to work with (aside from being very very costly to make).</p>

<p>Now, what you demand of your antenna if it has to cover 100 kHz to 20 MHz is that it has a fractional bandwidth of $\frac{19900\,\text{kHz}}{10050\,\text{kHz}}\approx 1.98$. Such antennas have not yet been invented, to my knowledge!</p>

<p><strong>loop antennas</strong></p>

<p>Now, a loop antenna especially has what we call high Q – it is narrowband, rather than wideband. That has a lot of advantages; for example, it can be relatively small compared¹ to the wavelength $\lambda$, and it doesn't pick up noise or interference from frequencies that you don't care about – that's primarily important to keep your first amplifier stage from becoming non-linear.</p>

<p>Quite luckily, you don't have to buy an infinite number of antennas – many antenna types can be <em>tuned</em> to a specific frequency. Downside of tuning is that it happens mechanically – e.g. by adjusting a variable capacitor – but it works. Still, this means that the 1 MHz from 100 kHz to 1100 kHz is much harder than the 100 MHz between 1 GHz and 1.1 GHz!</p>

<p><strong>practice</strong></p>

<p>So, most often, you'd encounter a set of antennas, working on different, usually separated, bands, instead of one antenna that tries to receive all these bands and the spectrum in between.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How can I improve the signal/noise ratio of my current loop (I already shielded the DX-Patrol with aluminium and I suppose ferrite beads along the feedline and USB cable would also help)? Would an additional amplifier help (the SDR has already an internal LNA)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>to amplify or not to amplify, that is the question</strong></p>

<p>Gut feeling: If your receiver already has an LNA, you'd need to invest relatively much money to get an LNA with a better noise figure, so, no, that's usually not the way to go, unless your signal is below the sensitivity of your receiver, even without its input amplifier.</p>

<p><strong>sensitivity, or: the magic of oversampling</strong></p>

<p>Now, with SDR, defining <em>sensitivity</em> is a bit challenging – after all, the <em>receiver</em> is not only the thing doing the RF reception, the mixing, and the analog to digital conversion, the actual extraction of the signal of interest from the received signal (for example, the FM-modulated voice, or the PSK31 data) happens <em>in software</em>. The trick usually employed by SDR receivers is <em>oversampling</em>, which means that you have a signal of a given bandwidth $b$, but you sample it with a multiple of that, let's say $f_s = n\cdot b$. Then, through digital signal processing, namely filtering and decimation by $n$, you can get an SNR increase by $n$ (only applies to white noise)².</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>I don't know the MK4, but I think it's based on an RTL2832. That chip will happily give you (I think) up to 3.2 million samples per second, $f_s=3.2\,\frac{\text{MS}}{\text s}$.</p>

<p>Now, let's say you want to hear a CW/morse station whose bandwidth you can limit to let's say $b=1\,\text{kHz}$; therefore, our $n= \frac{f_s}{b}= 3200$; assuming perfect filtering (we can't, really, make that assumption without a bit of mathematical justification, but bear with me for the time being), that's an SNR win of $3200\approx 35\,\text{dB}$. Now, assume your actual morse decoder (might be your ear) needs an SNR of $6\,\text{dB}$ – then you can still work with an input SNR of $-29\,\text{dB}$ That's nearly thousand times the signal energy in noise!</p>

<p>We can see that in action every time we activate our GPS receivers: The GPS signal reaching earth is really weak – in fact, it's weaker than the thermal noise in any non-cryogenically-cooled receiver. But: due to the high processing gain (correlation) of GPS receivers, that's no problem. </p>

<p><strong>advantages of SDR and their limits</strong></p>

<p>Also note that it's digitally trivial to select <em>any 1 kHz</em> from your sampled bandwidth – building an analog filter that could do the same would be terribly complicated, and that filter would be much worse in all relevant aspects (suppression, steepness, loss)!</p>

<p>Basically, that's why we rather do high-sampling-rate SDR than analog narrowband receivers these days. As hinted at above, this hits limits when the RX chains becomes nonlinear (meaning that the amplified signal amplitude at every time instant isn't really the same factor times the input signal amplitude), because then you get intermodulation. This can happen, for example, if you put your receiver to maximum gain (to receive a weak signal), but your antenna also picks up a strong signal, which isn't filtered out before it reaches the amplifiers. The amplifier does its best, but it can only scream so loud, and suddenly, things that aren't actually there ""on the air"" get mixed into the signal of interest. But: that can often be countered with relatively relaxed analog bandpass filters (or bandstop filters, to suppress known narrowband interferers) and gain limitation.</p>

<p>Since frequency-selective antennas basically <em>are</em> bandpass filters, that explains SDSolar's <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/questions/8948/broadband-antenna-for-sdr-radio/8952#comment13336_8948"">comment</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With the wideband capability of those receivers you will want specific antennas to focus on specific frequency ranges, even if the signal is very close to you. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since your SDR receiver can receive such a huge swath of spectrum (100 kHz to 2 GHz), it's impossible it has a narrow bandselection filter in front of the LNA³, thus it's likely that an interferer much stronger than your signal of interest will get picked up by your receiver. If that interferer is sufficiently strong to bring your receiver into nonlinearity, you get problems. Notice that the spurious free range of LNAs is often not that small – but I haven't tested the MK4 myself, and I generally have learned not to trust marketing brochures and manuals, so I can't say at which interferer power that will happen. But: the LNA will definitely be much nicer to your signal than the RTL2832-integrated amplifiers, so do try to keep the LNA active (and if it has adjustable gain, as close as possible to maximum), and use the gain of the RTL only to make the signal ""fit"" the whole ADC range. You'll probably notice when you're overdriving any amplifier in the chain – you'll see ""ghost"" frequencies becoming stronger faster than the real-world signals.</p>

¹: $\lambda(f) = \frac{c_0}{f}\implies \lambda(100\,\text{kHz}) \approx \frac{3\cdot10^8\,\frac{\text m}{\text s}}{10^5\,\text{s}^{-1}}= 3\cdot10^{3}\,\text m=3\,\text{km}$, by all means, that's HUGE!</p>

<p>²: Beinaymé formula</p>

<p>³: In fact Dynamic Range-optimized special-purpose SDRs (e.g. for localization) do have exactly that, a bank of band-selection filters, but that's <em>really</em> expensive; good filters are actually what makes things like professional wideband measurement equipment so freaking expensive.</p>

","<p>Just to make it clear - if you're wondering why the directivity changes from one configuration to the other, there is no clear answer. The directivity of an antenna varies a lot, depending mostly on the shape of the antenna. </p>

<p>If you're wondering why you have this particular link between directivity and gain, it is actually logical that you would find this:</p>

<p>$G = E_{antenna} D$</p>

<p>Where $E_{antenna}$ is the antenna efficiency (you can look it up on wikipedia). If you have an omnidirectional antenna, you have a lower directivity, and thus a lower gain than for a directive antenna.</p>

<p>This being said, you might also have a different antenna efficiency for those two frequencies, explaining a bigger gap than what you would obtain with only the directivity thing.</p>

"1200 baud packet radio can't communicate","449","","<p>I'm toying with a simple 1200 baud packet radio I built.  I'm attempting for it to be compatible with APRS, which uses the Bell 202 signaling, 1200Hz for mark and 2200Hz for space, which I assume map to 0 and 1 respectively.</p>

<p>However it's not communicating with the commercial TNC I'm using or testing.</p>

<p>I've tried mapping 1 to space and 0 to mark as well, but that doesn't work either.</p>
","<p>If you're used to dealing with protocols between chips, like UART, SPI and I2C, then APRS will feel quite strange. Whereas if you've been involved with CAN, Ethernet, USB at the low level, then APRS will seem quite familiar.</p>

<p>It's not as simple as 1200Hz means 0, and 2200Hz means 1. There are two things which make it different, firstly bit-stuffing, and secondly NRZI encoding.</p>

<p><strong>Bit-Stuffing</strong></p>

<p>For reasons that will become clear in a moment, you're not allowed to transmit more than 5 1s in a row. If you want to transmit more than five 1s in a row, you'll have to stuff extra 0s to break up the string of 1s.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/p5TCA.png"" alt=""Bit Stuffing""></p>

<p><strong>NRZI</strong></p>

<p>Non-Return to Zero inverted is an alternative way to encode a bit stream. Surprisingly, it's the change from one frequency to the next which encodes 0 and 1. Between each 1/1200th of a second, if the frequency changes, that's a 0, and if it doesn't change, that's a 1.</p>

<p>Take your original bit stream. Imagine turning all the 0s into edges, and all the 1s into not-edges, like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dX9Zn.png"" alt=""APRS encoding""></p>

<p>Then join up the edges, like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1rz8V.png"" alt=""APRS encoding""></p>

<hr>

<p>The receiver uses the frequency changes to synchronise itself to the incoming bit stream. It needs to do this fairly often to make sure it stays synchronised. This is the reason that a long string of 1s isn't allowed. A long string of 1s means a long time without any frequency changes.</p>

<p>For more information on implementing APRS, there's a good set of blog posts on <a href=""http://hugosprojects.wordpress.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hugo's Projects</a> which goes into detail about all of the implementation issues.</p>

"Idea for better reception in crowded city","449","","<p>I am living in crowed area of a city. It is impossible for me to set up an antenna outside the apartment. I receive signal inside the room.</p>

<p>I have a funcube dongle pro+ and some RTLSDR, the picture shows the antenna I am using:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4vkzG.jpg"" alt=""http://imgur.com/iT8iVCf""></p>

<p>Any suggestion on improving the reception by using other antenna of similar size or amplifier?</p>
","<p>You have a tough problem, because you are surrounded by many noise sources.</p>

<p>First, you should make sure that you have eliminated <strong>your own apartment's noise</strong>, because it is likely to interfere no matter what antenna you use.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Try shutting off all electronic equipment (including e.g. fluorescent or LED lights, and power adapters plugged into the wall) in your apartment, and use a laptop <strong>on battery power with no other equipment connected</strong> for receiving. If this cuts down the noise to a worthwhile degree, then you can start looking for individual problematic devices. In some cases, placing ferrite beads on cables connected to the noisy equipment can help (make sure they are appropriate for filtering the frequencies of the noise).</p></li>
<li><p>The computer the dongle is attached to can itself be a source of noise. Try using a different computer. Try connecting the dongle to a self-powered USB hub instead of directly from the computer, and move it away from the computer.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now, if your primary noise sources are not nearby, here are some antenna-based approaches for getting more signal and less noise:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use a <strong>directional antenna pointed at the transmitter</strong>, thus attenuating all noise sources which don't happen to be in the same direction as the transmitter.</p>

<p>This requires you to know where to point the antenna — if you're trying to receive transmissions from moving vehicles, for example, it will not help. It will also not work as well indoors since the surrounding building will affect the effective pattern.</p></li>
<li><p>Use an antenna which is significantly better at receiving the desired signal <em>frequency</em> than other frequencies — that is, have the antenna act as a <strong>filter</strong>. Your receiver hardware already contains a filter to suppress signals outside the band you tune to, but no filter is perfect, so you will always get some out-of-band leakage. Using an appropriately tuned antenna also improves the antenna's efficiency at collecting the desired signal.</p>

<p>Since you specify ""30-400 MHz"", which is a very wide band, this implies an antenna which is <em>adjustable</em>, tunable, in some way. A telescoping whip as seen on portable FM radios is a common example of such an antenna; a telescoping whip with an adjustable loading coil is even narrower; there are also loop antennas which are tuned by variable capacitors, and many other possible designs. (The antenna you have is a fixed-length whip with a fixed loading coil.)</p>

<p>If you have a tunable antenna and a SDR receiver, there is a simple way to determine when you have it adjusted correctly: watch the noise floor of the spectrum and adjust until it is at a <em>maximum</em> — ideally, there should be a visible hump with a peak at your desired frequency and dropping off elsewhere, but whether you can actually see the hump on-screen depends on the bandwidth of the antenna being smaller than the bandwidth of your spectrum plot. (Yes, it sounds funny to be tuning for maximum noise, but the antenna doesn't distinguish in-band signal from in-band noise, so we're also tuning for maximum signal.)</p>

<p>Unfortunately, using a tunable antenna is somewhat in conflict with the above option of using a directional antenna, because directional antennas have more complex shapes with multiple dimensions that must be adjusted for the desired frequency, else they will not have the expected radiation pattern.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Receive the noise and subtract it.</strong></p>

<p>This method is good when there is a single, known noise source, and works by using a secondary antenna which is set up to receive the noise source better than your primary antenna. The signal from this antenna is then subtracted from the main antenna's signal (or rather, added but opposite in phase), thus removing that specific noise source. This requires equipment to provide phase and amplitude adjustments to obtain good cancellation — <a href=""http://www.mfjenterprises.com/Product.php?productid=MFJ-1026"" rel=""nofollow"">the MFJ Enterprises MFJ-1026 is an example</a> (I am not recommending this product).</p>

<p>This method is fundamentally the same thing as building a specialized directional antenna optimized for not receiving the noise source, but more modular and adjustable.</p></li>

"What antenna to use for medium frequencies in an apartment building?","448","","<p>I'm living at the 6th's and top floor of an apartment building. I have a balcony with a metal balustrade. Above the balcony there is a metal roof rail. I need an antenna which won't be noticed by the house owner or which can be put away easily while not being used.</p>

<p>One thought I had was talking to my neighbor, who has a balcony roughly 6m away, whether I could throw a cable over. If this is done close to the wall it might be hardly noticeable from the ground. The issue I see is that both ends will end close to the metal balustrades and be close to the house wall which I fear will be causing trouble with emitting and receiving radio waves in good quality.</p>
","<p>So it sounds like you want to do everything. There's nothing wrong with that, but there's no single answer of one antenna that can do everything. You are going to hit a certain wall at either 40 or 80 meters where there's just nothing you can do with the space you have, but here are some solutions for frequencies above those. Google (try ""compromise antenna HF"", ""apartment antenna ham"", and the terms below for more) will find thousands of pages of people in the same position as you are!</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Lower HF bands (20m, 30m, 40m, 80m) - you're not likely to be able to get a dipole at these lengths to fit anywhere. You can try a loaded dipole to get it shorter but your best bet is likely to be either a random wire antenna or a magnetic loop antenna. There are ways to do either of those completely homebrew or completely commercial, and you'll be able to get a few different bands either way.</p></li>
<li><p>Higher HF bands (6m, 10m, 12m, 15m, 17m) - in addition to the solutions above, you may be able to get away with a dipole or random wire outside at these lengths. All you need is two points, a half wavelength apart. At 10 meters, that's pretty easy to do - a five meter antenna with the feed point in the center. Again, can be done with parts from the hardware store or you can buy a fully built and tested dipole, off-center fed dipole, or G5RV antenna.</p></li>
<li><p>VHF/UHF (144MHz, 222MHz, 430MHz) - this one is easy. The antennas are tiny, you can easily mount one on a mag-mount base and stick it on your balcony. It won't be ideal because you won't have the same ground plane that a metal roof would get you, but it will be good enough. The J-pole is another common antenna at these frequencies. It's important to note that if you use a normal quarter wave dipole, you'll need to use it vertically, to match the vertical polarization of most handheld radios.</p></li>
<li><p>Microwave (GHz range) - this band is the experimenter's dream. You don't need a big antenna, but you do need specialized components and there isn't as much activity up here. Certainly something to consider, but you probably want to get something set up on one of the lower bands first.</p></li>

<p>Without that resistor there's no isolation between the output ports. You say you are using this to feed an antenna array. The consequence of not having isolation between the ports is that if any of the antenna elements is not a perfect match, that reflected power will show up on the other antenna elements, messing up your phasing.</p>

<p>With the resistor, if there's a perfect match everywhere, each output is in phase and so there's no voltage across the resistor.</p>

<p>When there's some reflected power from one of the antennas, half the power goes back through the input, and the other half is dissipated in the resistor. Ideally, none goes out the other output. In practice you can expect 20dB of isolation.</p>

<p>But you have three antennas. Fortunately, Wilkinson power splitters can be made with any number of ports. This <a href=""http://www.microwaves101.com/encyclopedias/n-way-wilkinson-splitters"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">article by Microwaves101.com</a> illustrates the concept well:</p>

</ol>
","<p>This is definitely not a definite answer, but let's start an answer to gather insights:</p>

<h1>The PA0RDT mini-whip design. Allegedly 10kHz-20MHz […] Uses JFETs and I don't have a cheap source for them. I would settle for an equivalent.</h1>

<p>That's just an active antenna. The antenna part is a really small rectangle, and thus, the reception efficiency is extremely small. The power levels coming out of the device are only high because noise and signal have both been amplified.</p>

<ul>
<li>An ""active antenna"" such as the mini-whip is really just an antenna with an integrated amplifier, nothing more or less. </li>
<li>The mini-whip isn't a wideband antenna at all –
the antenna part is just consistently bad across all frequencies of
interest.</li>
<li>I don't know whether we've talked about this – but usually
""I can't source JFETs"" is more of a misunderstanding, and not a fact,
lest you're living in a really remote region of this world. Also, you can usually   replace old JFETs (depends on the type, of course) with modern
MOSFETs and get even higher input impedance with same gain &amp; noise
specs.</li>
<li>Being kilometers in wavelength, the 10 kHz – 20 MHz range will definitely require you to use an electrically short antenna, so might as well just use this</li>
<li>Beware that the high gain of this amplifier, plus the fact that the rectangular aperture antenna actually used by the mini-whip means that it's extremely susceptible to noise pickup from nearby electronics – there's nothing ""preferring"" your signals of interest over noise of anything close to the amplifier. I'd argue you'd want to mount this antenna far away from your electronics.</li>
</ul>

<h1>The Dressler-type antenna for 50MHz-2GHz</h1>

<p>That's a very, very interesting antenna design, from an antenna theory point of view. It's a true wideband antenna, and that's by the fact that it's basically made of a gap between two conductors that increases over its length – think of an array of dipoles, each one with a different length.</p>

<ul>
<li>Larger, hard to build, probably not really all that efficient at the lowest frequencies, but pretty!</li>
<li>I'd argue that it might pay most to restrict it to 200 MHz – 2 GHz; that makes building easier</li>
</ul>

<h1>Loop-amplifier-balun</h1>

<p>Loop antennas is actually what I'd go for in the lower frequency regime. </p>

<p>But: Loop antennas inherently have very bandwidth. They're never wideband. You'll need to <em>tune</em> them to achieve more frequency coverage (the bandwidth of an antenna is what it can receive at any <em>single</em> point in time, without detuning it). The article claims its antenna is ""wideband"", but that's not true – it's just ""consistently good enough with amplification"", see the mini-whip (of course, a large loop diameter makes for a much more efficient receive antenna than a small patch of metal, but still, not an efficient antenna at a wavelength that is 3 orders of magnitude larger than the antenna).</p>

<p>And: Amplifier circuits based on the transistor BF494... sigh. These transistors have become <a href=""http://www.mouser.de/ProductDetail/Fairchild-Semiconductor/BF494/?qs=UMEuL5FsraBRaTSIb6opfA=="" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">obsolete</a> a long time ago – there's simply cheap replacements that are superior in every technical aspect, especially temperature behaviour, noise and inter-device variations, that engineers designing a circuit post-1990 wouldn't even consider these devices. But, that's the beef I have with ham magazines, schematics are covered by the editors for decades (not only years, decades), without critical inspection. </p>

<p>And that's the primary reason why there's a huge disconnect between what is technically possible and cheap these days and what's used by amateurs all over the world. Whilst the physics governing how antennas must be shaped haven't changed over the last 90 years, semiconductor device state of the art has. </p>

<p>It's beyond me how that happens – Circuits with transistors you can't even buy (aside from the astronomic prices of people who've bought up devices as soon as they went out of production) can't really be a selling point for magazines.</p>

<h1>just found this antenna for 3.1-10.6GHz, can it be scaled down (or up? Down with the frequency up with the size)?</h1>

<p>Exactly, down with the frequency, up with the size, inversely proportionally. So, to get this from 3.1 GHz – 10.6 GHz down to 3.1 MHz – 10.6 MHz, the thing needs to be increased in size by a factor of 1000.</p>

<p>I'd argue that this is a relatively hard design to scale up. Stick with the common wideband antenna types that can be implemented ""flatly"", being:</p>

<ul>
<li>logarithmic-periodic antennas (logper)</li>
<li>Vivaldi Antennas</li>
<li>Other tapered slot helicals (like the ""Dressler""-type you mentioned)</li>
</ul>

<h1>Other, commonly encountered things</h1>

<ul>
<li>For the 50 – 250 MHz range, I'd really just go with a telescope monopole antenna – exactly the thing your old portable stereo has  (had?). I'm advising someone who's been designing, testing and verifying a DAB+ receiver with nothing more than that. It works well, and is easily tuned to any specific frequency by extending/pushing it back together to be ¼ wavelength</li>
<li>For the impressively low frequency ranges below 30 MHz, you'll probably want a resonant antenna (I think SDSolar would agree :) ), and that means you'll need a tunably capacitor or inductor. You noticed that, and asked a question pertaining to the design of tuners. It's easier than it looks (again... ham articles being 40 to 50 years stuck in the past).</li>

"Why are commercial SDRs so limited in operating frequency?","442","","<p>I spent a bit of time researching SDRs, mostly looking into the possibility of building an all-FPGA-based TRX. There are a lot of commercial ready solutions; some are cheap, some not, but they all tend to be operating from 50/70 MHz frequency range.</p>

<p>I am a complete newbie in RF processing and what escapes me is: if the circuitry is able to process a 50 MHz signal, why can't it do the same with lower frequencies? Is it some physics limitation? I guess it must be — otherwise everyone would advertise an operatiing range from DC to X MHz. Or is operating on lower frequencies uninteresting to everybody except hams?</p>

<p>My question is TRX specific — not RX only.</p>
","<p>Largely it has to do with filtering and bandwidth. An ADC requires an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aliasing_filter"" rel=""nofollow"">anti-aliasing filter</a> to remove all input frequency components that are more than half the sample rate. Otherwise, these higher frequency components get aliased onto lower harmonics.</p>

<p>As an example, if I have a 40 kHz ADC, it should be able to handle at its input anything from 0 to 20 kHz. If I should feed it 25 kHz, it will appear as 15 kHz...not what you want in a radio. The anti-aliasing filter removes everything above 20 kHz so this does not happen.</p>

<p>If I have that same 40 kHz ADC, but I want to handle radio frequencies above 20 kHz, I need to introduce a <a href=""http://www.radio-electronics.com/info/rf-technology-design/mixers/rf-mixers-mixing-basics-tutorial.php"" rel=""nofollow"">mixer</a>. This is a device that shifts one band of frequencies to another. So, if I want to work in the 40 meter band, I need a mixer that converts frequencies around 7 MHz down to 0 - 20 kHz for my ADC. However, my mixer will again require filters to avoid <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermodulation"" rel=""nofollow"">intermodulation</a> and aliasing.</p>

<p>All of this is equally applicable to transmitting -- the process is identical, except in the other direction. However, some stages of the transmitter must handle high power, which makes the filters larger and more costly. This is why it can seem easier to find a receiver with coverage of more bands.</p>

<p>So greatly simplified, the coverage of an SDR, or in fact, any radio, is determined by what filters it includes. As an example, take a look at the <a href=""http://fivedash.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=6"" rel=""nofollow"">SoftRock RX Ensemble</a>, which includes filters for four bands, and by changing the component values, can be built to cover LF or HF. With a sufficient selection of filters it becomes possible to cover the entire RF spectrum, but this would be expensive.</p>

"Is there a way to find out the location where a radio signal is intercepted?","441","","<p>I am a software engineer and a noob to radio.</p>

<p>Is there a way to find out the location where a radio signal is intercepted? That is, the location where somebody is eavesdropping on my wireless communication.</p>

<p>I don't believe this can be done if the receiver is not transmitting back, but I would like some expert advice. </p>
","<p>It is possible <em>in principle</em> to detect a receiver.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Almost all designs of receivers have a <em>local oscillator</em> (LO), which oscillates at the same frequency as the carrier frequency of the signal it is receiving, or at some close offset to it. The signal from the LO can leak back out the antenna. However, in a well-designed receiver this leakage is minimized and will always be immensely weaker than the signal from a transmitter.</p></li>
<li><p>A receiving antenna collects radio waves — electromagnetic energy. It therefore casts a shadow: if the receiver is between you and the transmitter, the signal will be weaker than if the receiver wasn't present. However, this effect will most likely be very much smaller than the effects of other large objects in the area that are not even radio devices (buildings, metal objects, landscape, etc.).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>These effects are very small and unlikely to be usable for good location purposes, or even to tell whether there's a receiver at all. Even using equipment designed for the purpose, locating a radio that is <em>transmitting</em> is tricky and requires readings taken at multiple locations, experience interpreting them, and guesswork; it will be essentially impossible for the orders-of-magnitude-weaker effects I've described above.</p>

<p>If you're talking about unlicensed digital communication systems like WiFi and Bluetooth, an additional complication will be other devices unrelated to yours actively using the same channel frequencies.</p>

<p>Finally, a hypothetical eavesdropper can be farther away than you might think: use of a directional antenna accurately pointed at the transmitter increases the received signal power, allowing it to be received from much farther away. Never believe any claims about how some wireless signal has a <em>maximum</em> range; it always depends on antennas and environmental conditions. (For a popular computer-security story on this, look up the “Bluetooth sniper rifle”.)</p>

However, two things remain unclear to me:</p>

<ul>
<li>Of what value should these capacitors be?</li>
<li>Where in the vehicle should these be installed? A schematic drawing would be very much appreciated.</li>
</ul>
","<p>The most important and simplest thing you can do to eliminate alternator whine is run a separate set of power cables directly from the cars battery terminals to the radio. Making sure you include the proper rated fuses links on both leads immediately after the battery terminal connection. (the fuses are for safety and should be on both the positive and negative leads)</p>

<p>Doing that should solve a good portion of your issue. </p>

<p>You should also make sure the antenna is properly grounded to the vehicles body. If it is mounted on a trunk lid you will need to add a ground connection from the body to the lid. As the hinges don't offer a solid ground.</p>

<p>Lastly you can buy a noise filter to put in the power leads just before the connection to the radio. This can be purchase at your every day electronics shack or automotive store. make sure you purchase a filter that can handle the load your radio will put on it.</p>

"Can an amateur use cellular technologies with SDR?","437","","<p>Software Defined Radio is opening up many new possibilities for amateur digital modes.

Can this technology be used by amateurs? Could an amateur cellular network be deployed sometime in the future?</p>

<p>Note: I know that there are many small practical considerations to doing this. Cellular technologies are heavily patented, but patents on many older GSM technologies have recently expired. Also, some deployment tweaks will be needed to adhere to amateur regulations, such as disabling encryption. Answers should focus on the fundamentals of amateurs using cellular technologies via sdr and not these small hangups. </p>
","<p>Yes it can be done, and there are some huge advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>Better use of bandwidth</li>
<li>Existing chipsets/support/implementation</li>
<li>Low power</li>
</ul>

<p>In fact there's little reason why one couldn't essentially replace DSTAR and competing systems with a standard based on GSM and GPRS technologies.  Even for those parts that are patented, the patents running out means we'd be using technology that's advanced well beyond DSTAR and similar systems, and it's completely open.</p>

<p>Beyond that, there's a lot of rewording and clarification and other insignificant stuff. There are some new questions here and there, but not a lot, and they all cover the same body of knowledge covered by other questions. As always, about 70% of them can be answered with common sense.</p>

"What is the minimum signal strength I need to receive?","427","","<p>Let's say a transmitting station is using a 8W radio with a J pole antenna. The cable connecting the radio to the antenna is RG-58A/U and is 25ft long.</p>

<p>At 144.075MHz, the attenuation of the cable is 1.5dB. At 8W, the power from the radio is 9.03dB. Assuming no losses other than cable losses, the antenna is getting 7.53dB, or 5.66W.</p>

<p>Let's now say the receiving station, 4 miles away, has the same setup (8W radio, J pole, and RG-58A/U). Assuming the gain of the two J pole antennas is 2.15dBi, and using the Friis transmission equation, the receiving antenna is receiving 1.733e-8W.</p>

"Why are loop antennas placed horizontally in HF","417","","<p>I am thinking of a large (circumference $\approx \lambda$) loop antenna at low (HF) frequencies. At higher frequencies the loops are used as quad antennas that have relatively high gain towards the axis of the loop. However, at HF band these are often positioned horizontally above the ground. One would think that the ground would act as a reflector and the power would be directed upwards which is obviously undesired. Are the reasons purely mechanical or is there some other reason to use horizontal loops instead of vertical ones?</p>
","<p>I suspect they are built horizontally simply because they are easier to construct and support, especially at HF sizes.</p>

<p>Due to constantly changing ionospheric conditions, the received phase of HF signals is random, so that's not a reason to prefer any particular polarization. </p>

<p>Further, the ground does affect radiation patterns, but it's not so simple as ""reflecting"" RF energy straight up. Were this the case, dipoles also wouldn't work. What the ground actually does is create an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_antenna"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">image antenna</a> as if a second antenna appeared reflected through the ground, fed in opposite phase. This can result in peak radiation in <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/a/487/218"">many patterns</a>, depending on antenna height.</p>

<p>There is also some folk-wisdom that <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/questions/849/is-a-vertical-noisier-than-a-dipole-and-if-so-why"">horizontally-polarized antennas are quieter</a>.

<p>Has there been any similar projects in ham radio? Could DVB-T be used with reduced parameters, thus smaller bandwidth? Any tips and/or links are appreciated!</p>
","<p>So, a teaser first:</p>

<p>With GNU Radio, you can transmit various DVB standards. Here's Alexandru Csete <a href=""https://twitter.com/csete/status/738859910558015488"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">demoing</a> his DVB-S2 <a href=""https://twitter.com/csete/status/738860390868717568"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">transmission</a>:

<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QQhpO.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QQhpO.jpg"" alt=""TV showing video""></a></p>

<p>As you can see from the FFT Plot generated by the flow graph in the upper picture, some 7MHz of bandwidth would be sufficient for this transmission mode – the HackRF should, like the device Alexandru used, be able to deal with the 10MHz that this flowgraph ran at. </p>

<p>The input is really just an MPEG transport stream file that's compatible with the DVB-S2 specs. You can find a lot of these at W6RZ Ron Economos' <a href=""http://www.w6rz.net"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">website</a>, who's the main author behind gr-dtv.  File source doesn't sound that great – but really, MPEG transport streams like this are meant to be streamed, and you can just replace that file in the file source with a named pipe and pipe the output of your MPEG encoder to it, or maybe just the MPEG transport screen you grabbed off the air from another broadcast. Also, because GNU Radio is so flexible, you could just replace the file source e.g. with a UDP source, and let another computer stream MPEG to that, in case your computer isn't up to SDR reception of video, reencoding <em>and</em> SDR modulation. That's is a handful of things even for fast PC workstations!</p>

<p>I'm going to go ahead and shamelessly plug GNU Radio here: If you haven't heard about it, it is a Software Defined Radio framework. It's based on the idea of signal processing flow graphs, in which (as you can see in the upper screenshot) you connect blocks that contain functionality to a bigger, useful application. Such blocks can be simple things like ""multiply signal with a constant value"", or more complex things like a DVB-S2 modulator, or they can also be hardware interfaces (the <em>osmocom Sink</em> in the screenshot talks to your SDR device). You're also not limited to existing blocks: writing blocks that do things that aren't possible by combining existing blocks is easy, and there's a whole ecosystem of people writing modules for GNU Radio.</p>

<p>Without further ado: GNU Radio's <a href=""http://gnuradio.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">website</a> and the <a href=""http://tutorials.gnuradio.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Guided Tutorials</a>, which I strongly recommend.
 Generating an FM receiver takes minutes from scratch if you went through them, which shouldn't take too long, either.</p>

<p>I'm fully aware that SSTV with let's say 48kHz of sampling rate isn't really comparable to DVB-S2 with Megahertzes of bandwidth, but to answer your original question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Could DVB-T be used with reduced parameters, thus smaller bandwidth? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You <strong>can</strong> configure <code>gr-dtv</code>'s DVB-T (contained in the standard GNU Radio source code) for smaller bandwidth than what is used in above example, no problem. The lowest standardized (and hence, decodable by anyone) bandwidth is 5 MHz. </p>

<p>DVB-T is an OFDM-based transmission standard, and has a lot of channel coding. That makes a lot of sense, because it's designed to carry high-datarate bitstreams, and thus, by Shannon's Channel Capacity, needs a large bandwidth for a limited SNR. High bandwidth means that the channel response isn't ""flat"", ie. attenuation and rotation aren't the same for all frequency within that bandwidth. You need an equalizer to counter that at the receiver – equalizers are hard to do right, and even harder to implement fast, and so standards like DVB, IEEE802.11a/g/n/p (WiFi), LTE… take the channel and divide it into small subchannels with a DFT (the frequencies in the DFT don't cross-talk, hence the ""O"" in OFDM, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex). That way, you get a lot channels, but each of those is flat, so equalization is really just one independent correction factor per subcarrier.</p>

<p>If you reduce the bandwidth of OFDM a lot, you lose that advantage, and also get into SNR problems (signals within a small bandwidth necessarily have less energy than signals of the same spectral density in a larger bandwidth), so I'm not sure that scaling DVB-T below let's say 2MHz would work.</p>

<ol>
<li>Why does this exception even exist?</li>
<li>Has this been used for significant events, such as the Apollo Moon Landing? Or ever, to anyone's knowledge?</li>
</ol>
","<p>Prior to the internet getting a continuous stream of audio from a manned space mission was difficult, even when the mission was overhead, but, of course, due to orbital mechanics it often isn't overhead.</p>

<p>Amateur Radio enthusiasts would request and often gain permission to retransmit audio of space flights, and with some coordination and planning you could listen to space transmissions without having particularly expensive radio equipment - a few users would do the heavy lifting, and broadcast it as it passed overhead for them, and you'd simply tune into their retransmission.</p>

<p>However, licensed amateur radio users aren't permitted to use their station for general broadcasting, and specifically restricted from playing music over the air.  These two rules prevented space mission broadcasts (which occasionally did feature music), and so a special rule was provided that, with permission, users could retransmit such transmissions for other enthusiasts.</p>

<p>It's not commonly used now because NASA itself provides continuous broadcast access to most of their missions live via the internet, but in the heyday of the Apollo and similar space race programs Amateur Radio was often the only way to tap into these transmissions which were rarely broadcast via more general methods such as radio and television for exceptional events.</p>

<p>In fact, it would be surprising to me if they gave specific permission now unless good reason was provided as to why the internet streams couldn't be used. Keep in mind that this rule is an exception.</p>

<p>Do vacuum variable have any Q advantage in lower voltage applications?</p>
","<p>Q isn't related to the voltage. A simple definition of Q could be the ratio of the total energy in a system to the energy lost per cycle.  So the biggest factor in Q is the loss in the dielectric. </p>

<p>In general, vacuum variable capacitors (VVC) have a higher Q than air variable capacitors (AVC) but there is some overlap.  A common range for VVCs is a Q of 5000 to 10000, for AVC, a Q of 5000 is near the top end.</p>

<p>Vacuum would qualify as a better dielectric than air, but another reason to prefer VVC would be stability and endurance.  The VVCs are sealed in a glass or ceramic vessel and therefore less sensitive to temperature changes and immune to other environmental changes such as humidity, dust, insects, children, dog fur, etc.</p>

<p>When considering the Q of a tuned circuit, Q = frequency / bandwidth where the frequency is the resonant frequency of the tank and the bandwidth is the frequency difference between the 3 dB points.

","<p>What you describe is Software Defined Radio! Hurray!</p>

<p>So, everyone having read my answers knows: I'm a GNU Radio fanboy.</p>

<p>GNU Radio has to be understood as the Free&amp;Open-Source LEGO of Software-Defined Radio:</p>

<p>It comes with a huge library of signal processing blocks, which one can combine to build complex applications. Itself, it's not a library to be used to decode any particular standards, but you can download modules that combine GNU Radio blocks to do that.</p>

<p>You can write your own blocks in C++ or Python, and to build flow graphs out of blocks, you'd typically use Python or a graphical design tool called the GNU Radio companion.</p>

<p>FSK, for example, can be astonishingly easy to decode; if you neglect the need for synchronization, a complete FSK decoder might look like:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FgCMp.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FgCMp.png"" alt=""very basic""></a></p>

<p>which does nothing but convert an input signal stream to a stream of estimates of the current frequency. You'd of course would want to have things like filtering, sanitation, conversion to bits, and packetization, but again, there's already modules that do that for you; see the list at</p>

<p><a href=""http://gnuradio.org/redmine/projects/gnuradio/wiki/HamRadio"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://gnuradio.org/redmine/projects/gnuradio/wiki/HamRadio</a></p>

<p>They've got RTTY, PSK31, and a lot more (FSK is really just a general modulation scheme – there's a lot of modes that use it!).</p>

<p>What I feel I should mention is that you can, for example, use gr-dtv, the digital TV transmitter library within GNU Radio, to transmit extremely low-bandwidth TV – think of the digital evolution of SSTV, by using gr-dtv with appropriate MPEG transport streams that contain low-rate video and e.g. Codec2 audio.</p>

<p>I'd like to take the chance to highlight a few GNU Radio projects that are of interest in this context, but aren't specifically related to amateur digital modes:</p>

<li>GQRX is probably the most famous GNU Radio standalone application. It's a spectrum visualizer, and audio demodulator. I don't know from the top of my head whether it does digital modes (it probably doesn't), but it's extremely useful when trying to find a signal in a wide bandwidth receive signal</li>
<li>gr-inspector is awesome, in that it allows to estimate signal parameters out of life signals automagically</li>

<p>My sense from all of my research is that I should care about the <em>wire</em> length of the legs in the dipoles.  For instance, each leg of the 40 meter segment will be 32.6 feet in length.  I'm figuring that it's <em>actually</em> 32.6 feet, including the portion of the wire at the feed point that is loose and comes up to be bundled into the rest of the wires into the feed point.  This would also include the piece that is folded over at the end through the egg insulator.</p>

<p>The alternative is that the overall linear length is more important, which feels wrong, but, admittedly, antenna calculations are not my strong suit.  :)</p>

<p>So, should I be calculating linear length end to end from the feed point out or the actual wire length regardless of the way it comes into the feed point or the folded piece at the end for the insulator?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>As a followup, I've now built and hoisted the fan dipole.  I have it suspended from the center feed point / RF choke and from the ends at about 40 feet.  It tunes up between 1:1 and 1.6:1 on 80, 40, 30, 20, 17, 15 and 10 meters.  It's a big tangle of wires until you get it into the air but well worth the time and effort if you have the space, IMHO.</p>

<p>Usual practice is to cut the wires a bit long, measure the antenna impedance (or SWR), then make them shorter until the antenna is sufficiently tuned. This ""estimate, measure, adjust"" approach is much more practical than trying to account for all the variable factors above.</p>

"How slow is slow telegraphy?","398","","<p>On the UK Band Plan there are frequencies stating “QRS (slow telegraphy) Centre of Activity”. For example, 14,055 kHz on 20m and 3,555 kHz on 80m.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What is considered slow? (&lt;15 wpm?)</p></li>
<li><p>How close should you stay to the stated frequencies?</p></li>
</ol>
","<p>QRS actually means ""Please slow down"" and is not really defined as a specific speed.  So basically what they are trying to do is be as inclusive as possible.</p>

<p>When I earned my Novice license in 1971 the speed required was 5 wpm.  </p>

<p>Then when I earned Advanced in 1977 it was 13 wpm.</p>

<p>I am studying now for the Amateur Extra, and am amazed that there is no Morse requirement.  When I get serious I am sure I'll get it.  I'll probably make a single letter change in my callsign.  I am AL7** right now, but I want KL7**.</p>

<p>Local lore had it that most people had a ""plateau"" of about 10 wpm as they  progressed in speed.  It was said that was the speed where instead of writing down letters you could hear whole words like ""the"" and ""ES"" which meant ""and"" and so on.  </p>

<p>My experience was different.  My plateau is about 18 wpm.  At that point you don't even write it down; you just listen to the conversation.</p>

<p>It helps that a lot of it is preformatted, like ""QTH IS FAIRBANKS FAIRBANKS"" and ""RST 999"" and all that.  But when you get on with a conversation it takes time to learn to do that reliably.</p>

<p>So, to answer your question #1 - I would say slow is considered to be just slow enough that the other operator can copy - they'll send ""RRR"" or ""QSL"" to let you know.  If I had to put a number on it, it would be much less than 15 - more like 5 or so.</p>

<p>Answer #2 is pretty clear.  You simply stay on your assigned frequency.  Unless the other operator (maybe has QRM or QRN) and requests a QSY (change frequency).  </p>

<p>The UK band plan assigns 14.0-14.060 for this type of operation so clearly there is some flexibility.</p>

<p>Here is the relevant document in terms of frequencies, which I think you referenced:  <a href=""http://www.hflink.com/bandplans/UK_bandplan.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">UK Band Plan</a></p>

<p>In the USA we can transmit as fast or as slow as we want, and our only concern is interference with others.  </p>

<p>OK, those are the answers, now let me tell a quick story.  </p>

<p>When US Navy radio operators used to get trained in Morse, years back, they would all have typewriters.  (In all my exams we had a pencil and paper).  But the kicker is that their typewriter keys were all just flat black.  </p>

<p>The instructor would pull down a chart at the front of the room showing the layout of the keys, and they would start transcribing what they heard.  So far, so good.  They could get up into the 20s that way, with glances up at the chart.</p>

<p>Then at some point (early on - just a couple of days) the instructor would not pull down the chart.  From then on they were expected to develop muscle memory that would cause them to hit the right keys as they heard the code.  </p>

<p>I have heard wild stories about the speeds they could achieve.</p>

<p>Then they would start giving them high-speed code without typing.  Wearing earphones, they heard two signals - one for each ear, and different audio frequencies.  Then they would take a quiz on what they heard.  </p>

<p>Now those were the guys who could really do the job.  They could sit and monitor code and get the gist.</p>

<p>The single most important thing I learned in my Morse training was to not fret about missing a letter - because fretting will make you miss even more.  You need to just go on.  </p>

<p>My favorite frequencies for Morse are about 14.170-14.180, plus 80 meters.  And for SSB nothing beats 14.205.  I wonder how it is over there.  </p>

<p>Anyway, I hope you have an enjoyable experience if you do this.</p>

"Is frequency hopping a viable solution for privacy and security without encryption?","395","","<p>In terms of radio transmission, three major issues seem to arise for various sensitive transmissions:</p>

<li>Others do not know a message is being sent at all</li>

<p>In terms of amateur radio and non amatuer radio in different bands (if this is applicable) and different protocols/specifications (if this is applicable), how well does frequency hopping (without encryption) address each of these issues both in terms of avoiding the accidental observer, deliberate amateur (not as in amateur radio but amateur as in non-professional) observer, and determined professional government/authority observer. </p>

<p><strong>BONUS:</strong> How well does frequency hopping work in these matters when combined with encryption?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Others do not gain access to the content of the message</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>In the US amateur radio service, transmitting “messages encoded for the purpose of obscuring their meaning” is prohibited by <a href=""http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;SID=336ab7469b61ecbfa15086dbf1bf2c59&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=47:5.0.1.1.6&amp;idno=47#se47.5.97_1113"">§97.113</a> and specifically for spread-spectrum (SS) by <a href=""http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;SID=336ab7469b61ecbfa15086dbf1bf2c59&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=47:5.0.1.1.6&amp;idno=47#se47.5.97_1311"">§97.311</a>. I would imagine other jurisdictions have similar rules which prohibit such transmissions and/or require that hopping patterns etc. be published.</p>

<p>I'll leave the detailed question of whether it is useful for this purpose when legal to others who are more familiar with the technical aspects of spread-spectrum modulation. Some remarks from general principle follow.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol start=""2"">
  <li>Others cannot determine the location of the sender</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>No method can give you this as an absolute guarantee. Someone can always take a wide-band receiver and a directional antenna and look for where the received power is higher. All that spread-spectrum gets you here is requiring the receiver to have a wider bandwidth, therefore being unable to filter out unrelated signals from other radiators, making it harder to find the transmitter at a longer distance.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol start=""3"">
  <li>Others cannot block message channels</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Spread-spectrum techniques increase the power requirements of jamming, because the jammer must decrease the SNR sufficiently across the entire bandwidth and not just a narrow band.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol start=""4"">
  <li>Others do not know a message is being sent at all</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>This falls into the same category as point 2; as you move away from the transmitter, a spread-spectrum transmission will apparently disappear into the noise floor sooner, but if you are close enough a transmission is obvious no matter what the frequency.</p>

<hr>

<p>For the “accidental observer” as you put it, not attempting to decode spread-spectrum transmissions, they will receive the SS transmission as a (possibly imperceptible) increase in the noise floor. Thus, spread-spectrum signals are indeed unlikely to be accidentally received (or interfered with).</p>

There is a wire connecting each element to the boom. This is a 14 element antenna requiring 28 paired wires.</p>
","<p>The wire is probably tinned copper, not aluminium, but the material is not critical to the function of the antenna.</p>

<p>You could replace it with any other wire of similar thickness, but keep the length and shape of the wire exactly the same (within 1 or 2 cm) to avoid affecting the antenna design itself.  </p>

<p>Take all the usual corrosion precautions at the junction: lightly sand the aluminium immediately before installing the wire. Use stainless steel fasteners. Apply a bit of grease to the joint. You should probably read up some more on best practice.</p>

<p>While you're at it, check, clean and tighten all joints between pipes and to wires.</p>

<p>Your sudden loss of signal might be the antenna, or something else. A problem with an LPDA is easiest to see in the VSWR; at frequencies near the resonant length of the faulty element the VSWR will shoot up. Test it at both ends of each band and see that it performs as expected. If you have a long feedline, you can do some maths to find the VSWR at the antenna, from the VSWR in the shack.
In my experience you can test an HF LPDA on the ground, just pointing it up to the sky, or even lying flat on the ground if you have fairly dry soil. Keep it away from long metal objects of course. It won't give exactly the same result as on the tower, but surprisingly close, and good enough for fault finding.</p>

"How to calculate power loss between radio and antenna","390","","<p>I have a 5W HT that only kicks out about 1W by the time it hits my antenna (which I understand is the norm). How do I go about calculating power loss in various equipment?</p>
","<p>There are a few possibilities.</p>

<p>First of all, in larger assemblies (mostly important in repeater design) each component will have a parameter called insertion loss. This is the loss, in dB, through that componenet - the loss caused by inserting that component in your feed line. Filters have insertion loss, as do duplexers, and even inline wattmeters and adapters, although the last two should be pretty low. Typically this is about 0.5 dB for each filter or other component, at least in the installations I've seen.</p>

<p>Then you need to add in loss due to feedline. Different types of feed line have different losses at different frequencies. For example, to get the loss you've described (5W to 1W), and assuming a UHF HT in the 440MHz band, and 50 feet of RG-58 coax (a common small diameter coax) equates to about 5.6dB. This is a parameter that you would look up in a table or a graph from the manufacturer of the coax you're using. </p>

<p>You may also have some loss at the antenna itself. Especially ""rubber ducky"" antennas, which are electrically shorter than a true quarter wave antenna and compensated with loading coils, will have a certain amount of loss, also computed in dB. This basically accounts for the reactive and resistive losses in the antenna, decreasing the actual emitted power.</p>

<p>Finally, to calculate your actual radiated power, you can simply add up all these values. Every 3dB equates to cutting your signal in half, and 10dB equates to one tenth of your original power getting out. You would compute the actual power by multiplying your transmitter's power by $10^{(-\mathrm{loss~}(\mathrm{in~dB})/10)}$</p>

<p>So I was wondering if there is any book (or ebook) about how to use programming to process digital signals. I mean, I have read a lot of books about theory of digital signal processing, such as the Oppenheim books, but I feel that there is a gap between that theory and how to do it using a computer.</p>

<p>At my university, we use Matlab but I think that it is not practical since it can't generate binaries (or at least, not easily). So, I was wondering if there is any book but using Perl, Python, C, Java or so.</p>
","<p>This may not be a direct answer to the question but since a comment suggested a book, let me suggest some others that I have in my library.</p>

<p>First, what I think is the most practical for hands-on programming:</p>

<p>""DSP Software Development Techniques for Embedded and Real-Time Systems"" by Robert Oshana and published by Newnes.  My copy is copyrighted 2006 and I am not sure if there are any other editions.</p>

<p>This book (above) is more geared to the professional engineer who is doing DSP that may be embedded in microprocessor based systems as a lot of care is given to memory use and other concern for other limited processing resources.  For a student project it would be helpful but not really a real beginner book.</p>

<p>Another, also mentioned in the comment by @AndrejaKo is the Richard Lyons book ""Understanding Digital Signal Processing"".  This is more like a text book covering the mathematical foundation of DSP as well as the theory of digital filters, digital sampling, and so on.  It has a good chapter on Quadrature Signals that might be fitting for some SDR applications.</p>

<p>Another book similar in content to the Lyons book is one by Steven W. Smith with the title ""Digital Signal Processing -- A Practical Guide for Engineers and Scientists"".  Not really into the details of programming though.  I am only mentioning it because I have it but I recommend the Lyons book over this one.</p>

<p>And, an introductory book on what DSP is all about from a amateur radio viewpoint is a publication of the ARRL called ""Digital Signal Processing Technology"" by Doug Smith, KF6DX.  It has a slim bit of stuff on ham radio transceiver design using DSP (partial SDR mostly if I remember correctly).  But, not as much as I would like.</p>

<p>In summary, these are all reasonably good books but the best for programming is the first book I mentioned by Oshana and even that does not address ham radio type applications (or, maybe that is not the interest of your question).</p>

"What are the (US) rules about unlicensed low-power transmissions?","390","","<p>It is common wisdom that transmissions of any sort (perhaps unidentified, encrypted, in the FM broadcast band, etc.) are permitted if they are sufficiently low power.</p>

<p><strong>Where are the FCC regulations which permit this</strong>, or <strong>where can I find a well-accepted interpretation of said rules?</strong> People say they are in Part 15, but I read (well, skimmed) Part 15 and found mainly rules about offering equipment for commercial sale. I am specifically interested in permission for DIY or experimental transmitters and transmissions.</p>

<p>I am also interested in how these rules compare to those applying to devices transmitting in the “ISM” bands; is the latter equal or lesser in restriction?</p>

<p>(I am aware that while this question may be <em>amateur radio</em>, it is not about <em>the Amateur Radio Service</em>; I am asking it here in the hopes that it is a topic of sufficient interest to the community and that the relevant expertise is present.)</p>
","<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Title 47 Part 15 defines regulations which cover any device that</p>

<ol>
<li>Radiates RF, whether intentionally, unintentionally, or incidentally</li>
<li>Doesn't require an <em>individual</em> license for operation</li>
</ol>

<p>While a device might not require an individual license to be operated, it may still require FCC testing.  This applies most strongly to devices made to be sold to others, which is why you see a lot of commercial references.  Just because you are not commercializing your device, though, doesn't make you immune to the regulations affecting commercial devices.  In fact the only difference between home built devices and commercial devices in this section is that home built devices are not subject to testing, verification, and declaration of conformity.  They are otherwise subject to all the same rules.</p>

<h2>Regulation summary for home built, non-commercial, intentionally radiating devices</h2>

<p>Here is a list of some (out of many) of the regulations you will have to follow whether your device is commercial or not.  Your device must:</p>

<ol>
<li>not cause harmful interference, and must accept any interference caused by other devices that follow the regulations they are subject to. (15.5.b)</li>
<li>be disabled upon notice from the FCC that the device is causing harmful interference. (15.5.c)</li>
<li>be designed and constructed in accordance with good engineering design and manufacturing practice. (15.15.a)</li>
<li>be designed so that any user-operable controls do not allow the device to operate outside the limits of these regulations (15.15.b)</li>
<li>be labeled correctly (15.19)</li>
<li>be built for personal use, not marketed, not constructed from a kit, and built in quantities of five or less (15.23.a, 15.201b)</li>
<li>not transmit more than spurious RF inside restricted bands detailed in 15.205.</li>
<li>not conduct emissions onto the AC line, if connected to the AC line, greater than the limits specified in 15.207.</li>
</ol>

<h2>General RF field limits</h2>

<p>For intentional radiators devices must not emit a field strength stronger than specified for the frequency ranges measured at the distance specified:</p>

<pre><code>   MHz            Field Strength (microvolts per meter)   Measurement distance(meters)
0.009 -   0.490     2400/F(kHz)                           300
0.490 -   1.705   24,000/F(kHz)                            30
1.705 -  30             30                                 30
 30   -  88            100                                  3
 88   - 216            150                                  3
216   - 960            200                                  3
960   -  ∞             500                                  3
</code></pre>

<p>Unless otherwise specified under Additional Provisions and elsewhere(15.211-15.2xx) any intentional radiator following all other regulations is not restricted to any specific mode, modulation, or transmission scheme. (15.215.a)</p>

<p>Note that most of these bands have additional provisions</p>

<p>When would you need a different material type for the toroid? I've read Amidon's documentation on frequencies for their toroids, but I've also seen different frequencies shown elsewhere. Is there a chart that shows which material is best with which range of frequencies?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Do I need to use tape?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With insulated magnet wire, no. Ferrites are at least somewhat conductive, so you wouldn't want bare wire touching them. I suppose tape around the core could protect the thin insulation from sharp edges on the core.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When would you need a different material type for the toroid?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/q/1159/218"">How does one read a ferrite datasheet?</a> Fair-rite has very good datasheets on each of their materials.</p>

<p>In practice it can be difficult to predict the choking impedance since the core and winding geometry is very significant. More turns increases the flux in the core, but it also introduces more capacitance, moving the effective choking frequency lower and narrowing the bandwidth.</p>

<p>It's easier to determine the impedance empirically. <a href=""http://www.karinya.net/g3txq/chokes/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">G3TXQ</a> has a nice page of measured data for several designs. That should give you an idea of where to start.</p>

<p>You can also build the choke and install it, then transmit a carrier and <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/q/1271/218"">measure the common-mode current</a>.</p>

<p>I've also measured chokes with a RigExpert antenna analyzer. I imagine other analyzers work fine. If you're using bifiliar windings, connect the pair together at each end (common-mode currents are equal on each wire), attach the two ends to a connector with leads as short as possible, and then measure the impedance with the analyzer. For a coax winding connect the shield.</p>

<p>I wouldn't trust an antenna analyzer to be very accurate, since most are designed to be accurate only around 50 ohms. But it's accurate enough, and gives an easy way to check the choking impedance at several frequencies, and to determine if a change is making it better or worse.</p>

I can think of solutions involving a specifically shaped jig and a vise or hammer, but I'd like to know if there's a way to do this that's more practical.</p>

<p>The reason I'm asking is that I plan to make up a wiring harness which is not strictly symmetric but has something inserted in one half and not the other (e.g. a switch or ammeter). I'd like to be able to later change the wire length, termination, etc. of one side without also replacing the other side.</p>
","<p>Individual PowerPole housings are in fact easy to separate by hand, assuming they are not locked together in some way.</p>

Apparently the welding process also affects the outside surfaces of the connectors, because the individual housings slide together and apart easily whereas the welded ones have rougher, harder-to-slide surfaces.</p>

<p>If one <em>were</em> starting with housings that are jammed or bonded together, then another approach to reusing the parts as described in the question is to remove one or both <em>contacts</em> (terminals) from the paired housings (which requires a specialized tool or careful use of a tiny screwdriver or such), which does the same job of allowing the two wires to be separated.</p>

"Tuning an antenna with a SWR meter that relies on output power","378","","<p>In my (new) setup, I will have a solid-state HF radio driving an antenna through an antenna tuner. Both my radio and the antenna tuner have internal SWR meters, of the type that requires you to adjust the SWR meter reading based on your output power. My previous experience has been with meters that directly read SWR (either electrically or through cross needles).</p>

<p>I understand how to use these meters to make SWR measurements, but my concern is with the internal protection circuits of the radio. If the SWR is too high, the radio will automatically reduce the output power to protect the radio. When you're tuning an antenna tuner, the SWR may cause the radio to enter or leave this protection region, resulting in an inaccurate measurement of SWR.</p>

<p>How do you approach using an antenna tuner with this type of SWR meter?</p>
","<p>Most radios with SWR protection don't detect SWR, they just detect reflected power.  It's a much simpler (read that as cheaper) circuit to implement and it's what really matters anyway.  The manufacturer will have established a threshold for reflected power, based on the MOSFET's tolerance.  If the circuit sees more than this it will either clamp it at the threshold level, cut in some sort of limiter or cut out completely.</p>

<p>So I would set the power low (say, 5-10W for a 100W rig) and tune there.  Then go to full power.  Since SWR is a ratio, you'll have accurate readings without frying your radio.</p>

"Choosing capacitor for high-pass filter with cutoff of about 160 MHz","377","","<p>A strong (100 kW) local FM transmitter causes interference to or overloading of receivers in the VHF/UHF bands. It seems like a single, properly chosen, capacitor could make an effective passive high-pass filter. I would like the filter to pass 200 MHz and up effectively, while suppressing 108 MHz and below. I'm assuming that this doesn't require a particularly challenging filter slope. I envision using this in-line with a 50 Ω coax. </p>

<p>Using a filter design app, I put in a cutoff frequency of 160 MHz, and an R of 50 Ω, and got a capacitance of 20 µF. So far, so good.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Will this work? Is there an easier way? </p></li>
<li><p><strong>What type of capacitor is appropriate for this application?</strong> Should it be a ceramic, mica or film type or what? I need it to be useable to frequencies up to around 600 MHz. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>With this question, I am thinking of over-the-air TV reception as well as amateur radio and scanner reception. </p>

<p>I know specific FM traps are available, but those are band-stop filters. Shouldn't a high-pass filter be easier and have lower insertion loss as long as I don't care about anything below the cutoff frequency? </p>

<p>BTW, I didn't see much in the way of commercial products to do this. I am looking for something competitive with a $5-10 Radio Shack FM trap.</p>
","<p>While that would work somewhat, it won't work great. What you are describing, with a single resistor and capacitor, is a first-order filter. Such a filter has a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roll-off#First_order_roll-off"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">roll-off</a> of approximately 6dB per octave. This means for each halving of the frequency, attenuation is increased by 6dB.</p>

<p>Say you design your filter to have a a cut-off frequency of 200 MHz. The FM broadcast band ends at 108 MHz, approximately one octave below that. Consequently, you will get an attenuation of about 6 dB. That's not much.</p>

<p>It's a common engineering problem that steeper filters are harder at higher frequencies. If we wanted to separate 8 MHz from 100 MHz, that's still a difference of 92 MHz as in your example, but we'd have approximately four octaves to make the transition.</p>

<p>Given that you are looking for a simple solution, and you are experiencing problems from just one station, I would suggest using a <a href=""http://www.microwaves101.com/encyclopedias/quarter-wave-tricks"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">quarter-wave stub</a> of transmission line as a filter. Advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>you can make it from coax or twin-lead, which you probably already have</li>
<li>attenuation can be very good -- with a loss-less transmission line, attenuation is theoretically infinite</li>
<li>it's easy to tune (just need a pair of wire cutters)</li>
<li>it's easy to fabricate</li>
<li>it will work at any frequency that can be reasonably handled by your transmission line</li>
</ul>

<p>Disadvantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>it will also notch all the odd harmonics, so if you tune the notch to be at 108 MHz, there will also be notches at 324 MHz (108*3), 540 MHz (108*5) and so on.</li>
</ul>

<p>The theory of operation is a little magic but simple: if you are looking at something through a quarter wavelength of transmission line, you see the conjugate impedance of the thing at the end. For your purposes, what matters is that if at the end of the transmission line there is a short, then it looks open. If the end is open, then it looks like a short.</p>

<p><sup><a href=""/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fSJU89.png"">simulate this circuit</a> &ndash; Schematic created using <a href=""https://www.circuitlab.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">CircuitLab</a></sup></p>

<p>Remember, it only looks like a short or an open at the frequency where the stub is a quarter-wavelength long or an odd harmonic thereof. To other frequencies, it looks like some other complex impedance, which means it will change the impedance of your antenna, but this is <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/q/382/218"">probably not a big problem for a receive-only application</a>. If it is a problem, you will need a more complex filter -- even your simple RC filter has this problem. Again, the merit of this approach is simplicity, not perfection.</p>

<p>Anyhow, now you have either a short or an open which you can insert into your circuit. To make a notch filter, you have two options:</p>

<ul>
<li>put a short in parallel</li>
<li>put an open in series</li>
</ul>

<p>It's easier to tune if you opt for a stub that's open at the end, because you can just cut it. So this is going to look like a short, so we want to put it in parallel, which will effectively short out the antenna for frequencies where the stub is a quarter wavelength:</p>



<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Axpo1.png"" alt=""schematic""></p>



<p><sup><a href=""/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fAxpo1.png"">simulate this circuit</a></sup></p>

<p>A further advantage of this approach is that the stub can be added with a T-adapter. You can also just strip the transmission line and solder it together. Don't forget to weatherproof the connections if its outside.</p>

<p>Just for completeness, you can also use a series stub, which effectively disconnects the antenna:</p>

<p><sup><a href=""/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fHIn5U.png"">simulate this circuit</a></sup></p>

<p>The two work identically, so choose whichever one is easier to fabricate.</p>

<p>Whichever you pick, fabrication is pretty easy. Calculate the wavelegnth of the problematic transmitter, then cut a piece of transmission line that is a quarter of this. Remember to lengthen the transmission line according to the velocity factor. For example, if the offending station is at 108 MHz, and the velocity factor is 66%:</p>

<p>$$
\lambda = c / 108\:\mathrm{MHz} = 2.78\:\mathrm m\\
2.78\:\mathrm m / 4 = 0.694 \:\mathrm m \\
0.694\:\mathrm m / 0.66 = 1.05\:\mathrm m
$$</p>

<p>Tuning is critical, and it's easier to make it shorter than longer, so cut it a bit longer than this, then keep trimming off little bits until you get maximum attenuation of the problematic station.</p>

<p>What I would like advice on is the material for the antennas themselves. Spring steel has ideal mechanical properties, but isn't an optimal antenna metal.

<p>The system characteristics are</p>

<ul>
<li>435 MHz</li>
<li>Under 50kHz BW</li>

</ul>
","<p>As usual, for antennas, the better your material conducts, the higher your antenna efficiency. Hence, go for copper. It has an excellent conductivity per volume (which might or might not be critical in your application), and there's not many metals that will beat its conductivity at all. Steel really isn't good for that.</p>

<p>If you're using suitable frequencies, steel wire with a copper coating might work for a dipole. The frequency will define your skin depth and the losses that a non-perfectly conducting antenna will incur. Definitely sounds like you'd have to just copper-coat some spring steel and try.</p>

<p>Another thing: I don't know how stiff the deployed antenna will be, but you <em>are</em> in the earth's magnetic field, with long ferromagnetic rods; that will excert a torque on your satellite... I can't calculate how much, though, since I know nothing about your antenna sizes, your orbit, your height or anything about the satellite. </p>

<p>Now take a look at the output from my antenna analyzer:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LoWTG.png"" alt=""What my SARK110 sees"">  </p>

<p>Whhaaaat... Well, I'm happy with the 10 meter resonant point (given by M1)
but what the heck happened next? I read somewhere that traps would electrically shorten all subsequent dipole sections, but i'm not sure what to make of this. Why would the 12 meter section be so far out of tune. Any ideas?  </p>
","<p>Traps require that the sections that follow them to be shortened because they look like loading coils. We can demonstrate this by calculating the impedance of your trap at 28MHz and 24.9MHz.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LC_circuit#Impedance_2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">impedance of a parallel LC circuit</a> is given by:</p>

<p>$$ Z(\omega) = 
-j \left( 1 \over C \right)
\left( \omega \over \omega^2 - \omega_0^2 \right )$$</p>

<p>Where</p>

<ul>
<li>$\omega = 2 \pi f$</li>
<li>$\omega_0 = 1 / \sqrt{LC}$</li>
</ul>

<p>So for your trap:</p>

<p>$$ \omega_0 = {1 \over \sqrt{4\:\mathrm{\mu H} \cdot 8\:\mathrm{pF}}} = 176776695 $$</p>

<p>This is the resonant frequency in radians per second; if we divide by 2π we see that it's 28.13MHz as expected. We can then calculate the impedance at the relevant frequencies:</p>

<p>$$ Z(28\:\mathrm{MHz}\cdot 2 \pi) = j73.6\:\mathrm k\Omega \\
Z(24.9\:\mathrm{MHz}\cdot 2 \pi) = j2.89\:\mathrm k\Omega $$</p>

<p>In the case of 28MHz, the trap is a high impedance, and this serves to reduce the current on the section past the trap to some negligible level.</p>

<p>At 24.9MHz the impedance is much lower, but it's not nothing. Additionally, it is no longer a quarter-wave down the antenna, but something less. Because this impedance is purely imaginary and positive, it's an inductive impedance. We can divide the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_reactance"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">reactance</a> (the imaginary part of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_impedance"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">impedance</a>) by ω to get an effective inductance:</p>

<p>$$ {2.89\:\mathrm k\Omega \over 2 \pi \cdot 24.9\:\mathrm{MHz}} = 18.5\:\mathrm{\mu H} $$</p>

<p>Thus, at 24.9MHz (and just that one frequency), the trap looks just like a 18.5μH inductor. Just like a loading coil.</p>

<p>Because the coil is not at the base of the antenna but closer to the tip, its effect on the feedpoint impedance somewhat diminished. <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/q/3606/218"">I don't know the exact math</a>, although you can find loading coil calculators around the net. Normally we use a loading coil when we don't have room for a full-sized antenna, but here we are reasoning in the opposite order: because you have a loading coil, your antenna can't be full-size.</p>

"How can I use the 455kHz IF signal?","369","","<p>As I own a PL-660, I saw a <a href=""http://www.it9ybg.altervista.org/index_files/Tecsun.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">post</a> that 455kHz IF signal can be obtained by connecting a wire to the board.</p>

<p>I wonder, if I can tune to any signal by using this IF signal by SDR? And what are some common usage of this signal?</p>
","<p>Your radio, as most modern radios, is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superheterodyne_receiver"" rel=""nofollow"">superheterodyne receiver</a>. These receivers work by first converting the intended signal to a fixed intermediate frequency (IF, 445kHz in your case) then demodulating that. This is in contrast to a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct-conversion_receiver"" rel=""nofollow"">direct conversion</a> receiver, which demodulates the signal directly, without first converting it to an IF.</p>

<p>The superheterodyne design has a number of advantages, mostly due to the fact that much of the filtering and demodulation is done at a single frequency and so does not need to be tunable. For example, this allows crystal filters to be used, which can be very stable but can't be tuned.</p>

<p>Since whatever frequency to which you tune your receive is first converted to the IF, which is always the same frequency, if you can feed the IF to as SDR, then the SDR can see anything you can tune on the receiver. Essentially, you are replacing the demodulator of your receiver with an SDR.</p>

<p>The advantage here is that many cheaply available SDRs lack all the filters or the tuning range necessary to get the band coverage available in many receivers. Using an SDR at the IF allows one to use the radio for tuning, but use the SDR for demodulation.</p>

"What if someone responds to my CQ, but I can't hear him?","368","","<p>I tried making a CQ on 20 m, 14.060 MHz (the QRP CQ frequency) and parallel to that I had a WebSDR on my computer just to keep an eye on the band. I saw someone responding on the WebSDR, which is rather close to my hometown; however, I couldn't hear him on my receiver and the signal on the WebSDR was too vague to copy. </p>

<p>What should I do in such a situation (apart from improving my receiver)? Should I just send my CQ sequence again and hope the other side understands that I can't hear him, and stops trying or increases power? Or should I send another sequence to say that I know there is someone, but I can't copy him?</p>
","<p>Sending simply ""?"" is sufficient to request the station send his call again. If you want to be a little more verbose, ""QRZ?"" means ""who is calling me?"". If you can copy part of the call you can also respond with the unknown parts replaced with question marks: ""AC8? DE MYCALL"".</p>

<p>If you are working the QRP calling frequency you should expect most of your contacts to be difficult, and making repeated attempts isn't unusual. HF conditions can change rapidly, and sometimes all you need to do is wait a minute. It's not uncommon to send key information (names, calls, locations, RST signal reports) 3 or 5 times if conditions are poor.</p>

<p>If you just can't make it work, you can try to communicate that. ""QRN"" (I'm troubled by natural noise), ""QRM"" (I'm troubled by man-made interference) and ""QSB"" (I'm troubled by fading) can help you communicate your specific problem, though if conditions are poor it may be futile. In the case of another interfering station, you might ""QSY"" (change frequency) to some clear frequency.</p>

<p>Or, you can just keep calling CQ. It's not unusual on HF to be unable to make a contact. No one will be offended. The other station will infer that you can't copy their transmissions and either giver up or increase power, aim a directional antenna, or otherwise attempt to improve conditions.</p>

"Are there any antennas I shouldn't use in my car?","367","","<p>I've heard that ""rubber duck"" antennas shouldn't be used inside an automobile. What is the reason for this, and are there any other types of antennas that shouldn't be used inside a vehicle?</p>

<p>From test pool question: T9A07</p>
","<p>There's nothing particularly wrong with them. Cars, being mostly made of metal, do a pretty good job of shielding any RF signals, which is why you probably get worse reception when your HT is in your car. It doesn't help that rubber duck antennas aren't that good to start with - they are ""electrically short"", meaning that they are shorter than a true quarter wavelength, and they are monopoles, meaning that there is no ""counterpoise"" or ""ground return"" like in a dipole antenna. </p>

<p>Rubber duck antennas just perform worse than an ideal antenna, especially in a car. But that said, that hasn't stopped me from using my Wouxun with a rubber duck from inside my car, or a Motorola HT from inside an ambulance without any problems. Nothing terribly bad will happen, it's just not as good as using a real mobile radio with a real mobile antenna mounted to the roof of your car.</p>

"Minimum thickness of whip antenna","367","","<p>I'm looking at designing a communication system using very low power transmitter (0.1 W) and operating in the 400 Mhz range. For my uses I think a quarter wave whip antenna would work well, so I've calculated the length of the antenna to be 187.5 mm.</p>

<p>So far so good (I hope). Now I'm looking at how light I can make this antenna. My understanding is that an antenna of this sort is essentially just a bit of wire of the appropriate length (187.5 mm), but I can't figure out if there's a minimum thickness of the wire. The only limitation I can think of is a thinner wire has higher resistance and hence will heat more quickly (causing more noise). Is this really the limitation? I've never seen a very thin whip antenna and I fear there may be a reason behind this.</p>
","<p>At such a low power, durability is probably more of a concern than anything else. A few simplifying assumptions and quick calculations will demonstrate this.</p>

<p>The impedance of a quarter-wave whip is highest at the tip and lowest at the base. That is to say, the current is lowest at the tip, and highest at the base. So if we can demonstrate that the wire gauge is sufficient at the base, where current is highest, then it should be sufficient for the rest of the antenna, also.</p>

<p>Given your transmit power:</p>

<p>$$ P = 0.1\:\mathrm W $$</p>

<p>And the impedance of a quarter-wave vertical at its base:</p>

<p>$$ R = 36\:\Omega $$</p>

<p>And Joule's first law:</p>

<p>$$ P = I^2 R $$</p>

<p>We can solve this system of equations for $I$ and figure out what the current at the antenna base must be:</p>

<p>$$ 0.1\:\mathrm W = I^2 \cdot 36\:\Omega $$</p>

<p>$$ \frac{0.1\:\mathrm W}{36\:\Omega} = I^2 $$</p>

<p>$$ \sqrt{\frac{0.1\:\mathrm W}{36\:\Omega}} = I $$</p>

<p>$$ 0.053\:\mathrm A = I $$</p>

<p>So the question is now how small a wire can you use to carry (at maximum) 53 mA. You can look at a <a href=""http://www.powerstream.com/Wire_Size.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">wire gauge chart</a> and see the answer is ""pretty damn small"", especially considering we calculated the current at the maximum and it is less everywhere else in the wire.</p>

<p>There's another way you might approach the problem: you can calculate (again referencing a wire gauge chart) the resistance of some proposed wire. Then compare that resistance to the $36\:\Omega$ radiation resistance of a whip to get an estimation antenna efficiency:</p>

<p>$$ \text{antenna efficiency} = \frac{36\:\Omega}{36\:\Omega + \text{resistance of wire}} $$</p>

<p>I say estimation, because to properly apply this formula you must transform all the impedances to the impedance they would have at the feedpoint, but remember since the impedance is at a minimum at the feedpoint, were you to go through the trouble of doing that you would end up with a smaller resistance and a higher efficiency.</p>

<p>And so you can look at this and see that even if your wire has a $1\:\Omega$ resistance, you still have at least a 97% efficient antenna. And a wire that's a quarter-wave long at 440 MHz and has a resistance of 1 ohm is a really thin wire.</p>

","<p>I'm sure it's a simple monopole for 2 metres. Mount it through a hole in a large metal sheet.</p>

<p>17.5"" plus the distance from the bend to the groundplane, is almost exactly 1/4 wave on 2 metres.</p>

<p>Why two whips? I've never seen this before, but it will make it slightly broader band than a single whip. The effective radius of a pair of wires is (from memory) $r_{eff}= ({r_{wire}}^2+(spacing/2)^2)^{0.5}$. The wind resistance of the two wires might be lower than that of a single thicker conductor.</p>

<p>A quick note about 70 cm: often a 2 m antenna will also resonate at 70 cm. Being about three times the frequency, the monopole is 0.75 wavelengths long at 435 MHz. Unfortunately, the radiation pattern of a 0.75 wavelength monopole, or a 1.5 wavelength dipole, is far from ideal - it has a null at the horizon. So although the SWR is good, the effectiveness is poor. The longest you can make a monopole is about 5/8 wavelengths, which needs a coil at the base to add some inductance. With care you can make this coil work for both bands, but that's a new antenna design entirely.</p>

<p>In both cases the antenna depends on a reasonable ground plane, at least 18“ square, or a vehicle roof, etc.</p>

","<p>After some further research, I've decided to answer my own questions 
as I find the current answers insufficient. Evidently the ""best"" antenna also seem to be the simplest. </p>

<p>From the article: 
<code>""Antenna 101: Let’s Review the Basics""</code> <em>by Dan Farber</em> (<strong>AC0LW</strong>) in the 
magazine <em>The Spectrum Monitor</em> [July, 2016].</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Consider once again the humble dipole. In its most basic form, it is 
  cut to resonance at a desired frequency in a single band, and fed with
  coaxial cable. Notice that one side of the dipole is thus connected to
  the coax’s shield. Down at the radio end, the coax shield is connected
  to RF ground, that is to say the grounded side of the coax connector. 
  This works fine with no additional RF grounding.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This and the well known fact that the impedance of a: </p>

<ul>
<li><code>1/4-wave vertical</code> with good RF ground is <strong>~35</strong> Ohms.</li>
<li><code>1/2-wave dipole</code> is <strong>~70</strong> Ohms.</li>
</ul>

<p>This matches very well with the <strong>GPIO impedance</strong> that is believed to be 
somewhere between <strong>30-60 Ohms</strong>. (How to test?) Thus we can expect a natural impedance matching, or at least close enough, which is probably why these simple wire antennas work so well.</p>

<p>So as noted by the commenters in <a href=""http://makezine.com/projects/raspberry-pirate-radio/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> link, a simple 1/4-wave wire with 
a 1/4-wave ground along the table, will be quite efficient. The wires also 
has to be electrically isolated, to help prevent possible static damage.</p>

<p><strong>How to best prevent GPIO ESD damage?</strong></p>

<p>There are several ways applicable here:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use a ESD/TSV chip such as the <a href=""http://www.ti.com/lit/gpn/tpd1e01b04"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">TPD1E01B04</a> with Cio=0.2 pF.</li>
<li>Use a simple resistor with R >= 100 K Ohms.</li>
<li><strike>Use an inductor or inductive coil with X >= 100K @ 100 MHz.</strike> </li>
</ol>

<p>In each case you should connect the part between the antenna wire 
and device GND. Please see <a href=""http://hpfriedrichs.com/radioroom/bleeder/rr-bleeder.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">THIS</a> excellent blog about how to prevent static and lightning damage. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>WARNING</strong> I now recommend against using an inductor only, as it would force ground the GPIO pin, if set to 1 at DC during any other time, before the HF has been activated. This would surely damage your RPi.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE-1:</strong> For those concerned about the transmitted power, I've estimated it to be about <code>0.37 mW</code> in <a href=""https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/a/63624/17798"">THIS</a> answer. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However there were still one thing missing: no buffer stage to protect
  the BCM2835 SoC's clock generator output stage. Hardware failure due
  to the unbuffered operation of the WsprryPi program was reported by a
  few HAM operators, possibly due to overload from nearly broadcast
  transmitter stations. If buffer amplifier was already needed it was a
  good idea to add some gain to the system. Eventually using a single
  FET amplifier stage [fig 7] 10 dB gain achieved, delivering +20 dBm
  output power at the end of the LPF [fig 4]...
  For ESD and static discharge protection an ESD suppressor diode was 
  added to the antenna terminal of the circuit. </p>

<p>The GitHub README from the last link, basically concludes all my original questions: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As the Raspberry Pi does not attenuate ripple and noise components
  from the   5V USB power supply, it is RECOMMENDED to use a regulated
  supply that has   sufficient ripple supression. Supply ripple might be
  seen as mixing products   products centered around the transmit
  carrier typically at 100/120Hz.</p>
  
  <p>DO NOT expose GPIO4 to voltages or currents that are above the
  specified   Absolute Maximum limits. GPIO4 outputs a digital clock in
  3V3 logic, with a   maximum current of 16mA. As there is no current
  protection available and a DC   component of 1.6V, DO NOT
  short-circuit or place a resistive (dummy) load   straight on the
  GPIO4 pin, as it may draw too much current. Instead, use a<br>
  decoupling capacitor to remove DC component when connecting the output
  dummy   loads, transformers, antennas, etc. DO NOT expose GPIO4 to
  electro- static   voltages or voltages exceeding the 0 to 3.3V logic
  range; connecting an   antenna directly to GPIO4 may damage your RPi
  due to transient voltages such   as lightning or static buildup as
  well as RF from other transmitters   operating into nearby antennas.
  Therefore it is RECOMMENDED to add some form   of isolation, e.g. by
  using a RF transformer, a simple buffer/driver/PA   stage, two
  schottky small signal diodes back to back.</p>

"Is a modded Yaesu FT-270r acceptable to use on MURS frequencies?","361","","<p>I am a bit new to the radio scene, so excuse me for any ignorance that may follow.</p>

<p>I saw on a website that you could mod the Yaesu FT-270r so that you can increase its transmission range outside of 144 MHz. I have no plans on transmitting outside of  FCC designated MURS frequencies. (I am not a licensed ham operator.)</p>

<p>Would it be legal and/or OK to transmit on MURS with this mod on this radio? I'd rather find out know then start transmitting on MURS and get in trouble with the FCC for doing so if it is illegal.</p>
","<p><em>I am not a lawyer, and this is not legal advice. I'm also not particularly familiar with MURS, and generalizing from other information.</em></p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-Use_Radio_Service#Eligibility"">According to Wikipedia</a>, MURS (as many other US unlicensed radio services do) requires the use of <strong>type accepted</strong> equipment.</p>

<p>(Terminology note: <em>radio services</em> are CB, FRS, GMRS, MURS, amateur, commercial, etc.)</p>

<p>This means that the only radios you can use on MURS are those which the FCC approves for use on MURS. So, no, your modded radio cannot legally be used. (Modified equipment is only useful on the amateur bands or otherwise on frequencies which <em>you have been granted a specific a license to use</em>.)</p>

<p>And in these services which require type-accepted equipment, FCC generally only approves equipment <em>which cannot be used for licensed services</em> — the widely understood rationale being that they don't want to trust the users of the type-accepted equipment not to use the other functions.</p>

<p>Thus, there is no radio which you can legally use in the US which allows transmitting on both amateur frequencies and unlicensed service frequencies.</p>

<p>Above is a connection of half-wave dipole antenna. The book states that the current profile is same at any given time instant on both the radiators, each of quarter wavelength length.</p>

<p>Now my confusion is clearly the coaxial cable is connected to both radiators. Say I am sending the signal through centre wire and the braid of the coaxial cable is always at ground. Now at any given time instant, only left end of the cable is going to have non zero potential, while the right end is always at $0V$. Then how come both radiators would have same current profile at any given time when the excitation is different for left and right radiators!</p>

<p>To be very specific, say at any given time instant the voltage at the left end is 2.3V, so standing wave is generated in the left radiator, but on the right radiator the voltage is zero (braid is at ground), so how any excitation would happen on the right radiator.</p>

<p>Support will be greatly appreciated. I am a total newbie in antenna systems.</p>
","<p>You have aptly discovered why a <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/q/538/218"">balun is necessary when feeding a dipole with coax</a>. You are right to think the book is wrong, because it is. With a coax feed and no balun, the current distributions on the dipole are not equal because some share of the current that should be on the right half (connected to the shield) of the dipole is instead flowing on the feedline common mode.</p>

<p>The book would be accurate had it used a balanced feedline instead, or included a balun.</p>

<p>The coax shield is in fact not at 0V relative to ground, because without a balun there will be common-mode currents on it. The shield being at 0V is not a law but rather an assumption. That assumption is based on an antenna design with a properly designed feed and an absence of common-mode currents, which this design has not.</p>

    all the necessary material and then stand by on frequency until the

<p>Apparently autopatches (aka ""phone patches""?) are <a href=""http://www.arrl.org/phone-patch-guidelines"" rel=""nofollow"">common in the USA</a>, but searching the Web has turned up scant information about them in, for example, the UK.</p>

<p>That makes me wonder: are they legal in the UK, and if so, where can I find out more about how they are regulated and used there?</p>

<p>Likewise for other jurisdictions.</p>
","<p>Phone patches (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopatch"" rel=""nofollow"">autopatches</a>) are not legal in the UK.</p>

<p>The restriction is largely because a phone patch allows you to contact non-licensed people using amateur radio.</p>

<p>Of course, in an actual emergency, anyone can transmit anything on any frequency - but in a non-emergency situation there are strict restrictions on 'third-party traffic' (i.e. passing messages or voice from non-licensed people over amateur radio). In the UK, some club stations are allowed to pass third-party traffic, and at special events this is also sometimes permitted. This is usually done using a NoV (Notice of Variation) on the licence used by the club or individual during a special event.</p>

"Receiving without configuring CTCSS","355","","<p>I'm interested in listening to the local EMS/Fire transmissions around here and was wondering if I have to configure the CTCSS/PL tones on the radio in order to hear those transmissions.</p>

<p>I understand that a PL tone is used to create sub-banding in the same frequency to basically subdivide a single frequency into about 38 private ""channels"". </p>

<p>What happens if I don't configure a PL tone on my radio? Will I be able to hear all transmissions on that frequency even if some particular group is using a specific PL tone? I'm using a Baofeng UV-5RB.</p>
","<p>Your understanding of tone squelch is wrong. Tone squelch is simply an <em>extension</em> to the squelch system.</p>

<p>Normally, the squelch opens whenever the received signal is stronger than the squelch threshold.</p>

<p>With a tone squelch (and I use that term broadly here to refer to CTCSS, DCS and any other possible, similar schemes) configured for receive squelch, the squelch opens only if the received signal is strong enough <em>and</em> the configured tone is present in the demodulated audio. (The tone is filtered out before the audio is fed to the speaker or headphones; hence ""subaudible"" in the context of the radio transmission.)</p>

<p>All the issues with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_effect"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FM capture</a> and so on remain exactly the same with or without tone squelch, so you do not get any additional ""channels"". (Also consider <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/q/1797/29"">Can two FM radios transmit two separate PL tones at the same time, and be received by two radios with matching PL tones?</a>) All that happens is that you can filter out some of the transmissions that you are not interested in. This is particularly useful in situations where the received signal is relatively weak, as you can leave the signal strength squelch turned all the way down and rely on the tone squelch to only open for useful transmissions.</p>

<p>With that said, <strong>we can answer your question:</strong></p>

<p>If tone squelch is not configured on the receiver, practically any FM receiver will open the squelch whenever the received signal is strong enough, regardless of the presence of any particular subaudible tone or code, because it is not filtering based on any particular subaudible tone.</p>

<p>Hence, if you do not set up tone squelch on your radio, or your radio does not support tone squelch (applies primarily to older equipment), <strong>you should be able to hear all transmissions as they sound on the air.</strong></p>

<p>It isn't entirely uncommon that radios allow separate tone squelch for transmit and receive. This can be useful, for example, if your local repeater input is tone squelch operated (to reduce interference) but it does not re-transmit the tone on the repeater's transmit (output) side.</p>

"Why does an ""electrically small"" antenna have narrow bandwidth?","350","","<p>Reading this <a href=""http://www.ahars.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/The-Underestimated-Magnetic-Loop-HF-Antenna-version-1.1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">interesting piece</a> on magnetic loop antennas, the author explains that a magnetic loop has great efficiency even at small size, but the the price you pay is very narrow bandwidth. Why is this? </p>

<p>It seems counter-intuitive (and miraculous) to me that efficiency doesn't suffer, but bandwidth does when antenna size is much much smaller than wavelength. </p>
","<p>Short answer: electrically small antennas have a relatively low radiation resistance. With less resistance, the resonance is less damped, meaning a higher <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_factor"">Q factor</a> and consequently less bandwidth.</p>

<p>To expand on that a bit, consider a children's playground variety swing. It's essentially a pendulum, and depending on the length of the swing and the mass of the child it will swing at a particular frequency. By shifting one's weight at exactly this frequency, it's possible to get the swing going very high with very minimal (but well-timed) energy inputs.</p>

<p>The swing works because the work of each pump adds more energy, while relatively little is lost to friction. Thus with the proper timing, the work from each pump adds to the work of the previous until the swing is very high.</p>

<p>When the energy lost to friction is low compared to the stored energy, we say the swing has a high Q. The swing will continue swinging for quite a while even if the rider stops pumping. And the timing is very important, so it has low bandwidth.</p>

<p>Now imagine a swing submersed in a very viscous goo. The work of each pump goes almost entirely into the friction, and very little is stored in the swing. If the rider stops pumping the swing stops almost immediately (low Q). And the timing of the pumps hardly matters since all the work is lost to friction (high bandwidth).</p>

<p>A dummy load is analogous to this swing in goo: it stores no energy at all, and all the input energy is converted immediately to heat in the resistance. Thus a dummy load has <em>very low Q and very high bandwidth</em>.</p>

<p>Something like a resonant dipole is somewhere in the middle of these examples. Instead of alternating between kinetic and potential energy, it alternates between energy stored in a magnetic and electric field. However with each cycle some of this energy is lost to radiation, and this appears at the feedpoint as radiation resistance. This appears to a transmitter as an ordinary resistance just as the dummy load did, but this work is going into radiation, not heat.</p>

<p>This radiation resistance dampens the resonance, giving this example a <em>moderate Q, and a moderate bandwidth</em>.</p>

<p>As the dipole gets shorter it becomes less effective at radiating. Less energy is lost to radiation on each cycle. So if we want to radiate the same power, we must store more energy. A higher stored energy to energy lost ratio means a <em>higher Q, and a lower bandwidth</em>.</p>

<p>While this is unlikely to work in practice (for legal reasons, among others) I'm curious if such links can be established.</p>
","<p>I don't see why not. Of course, it's subject to the biggest problem with troposcatter: extremely high loss.</p>

<p>Let's work out an example to see how bad this is. Let's say we want a link at a distance of 150km. Borrowing numbers from <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/q/1486/218"">this question</a>, let's further assume that we need -84dBm at the receiver to make the link work. And just for now, let's assume we have an ideal, free-space path between the stations. We can apply the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friis_transmission_equation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Friis transmission equation</a> to determine the EIRP necessary to make this work:</p>

<p>$$ \begin{align}
P_r&amp;=P_t+20\log_{10}\left(\frac{\lambda}{4\pi R}\right) \\
-84\:\mathrm{dBm}&amp;=P_t+20\log_{10}\left(\frac{0.125\:\mathrm m}{4\pi \cdot 150000\:\mathrm m}\right) \\
-84\:\mathrm{dBm}&amp;=P_t - 143.6\:\mathrm{dBm} \\
59.6\:\mathrm{dBm}&amp;=P_t \\
\end{align} $$</p>

<p>So, our free-space path losses are -143.6dBm, and we'd need an EIRP of about 60dBm to make it work, assuming an isotropic receiving antenna. If we can have a 40dBi antenna at each end, then we'd need a -20dBm transmitter. Easy.</p>

<p>Only trouble is that paths of this length aren't even remotely like free space. There's probably a planet in the way. So say we want to use troposcatter...what are the additional losses?</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.mike-willis.com/Tutorial/PF9.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mike Willis has a great article on troposcatter</a>, which includes all sorts of empirical models and stuff. However, it's nicely summarized by this graph:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ceqyq.gif"" alt=""Troposcater excess path losses with a 30cm dish""></p>

<p>These are losses <em>in addition to</em> the ideal case we just calculated. For our example of 150km, we can see losses of about 62dB. That brings the minimum EIRP to 123dBm, or again assuming our 40dBi antennas, transmitter power of 43dBm.</p>

<p>Certainly feasible, even after adding margins for noise. With higher gain antennas, on the edge of possibility with consumer equipment.</p>

"Can there be (long range) propagation of HF from satellites?","348","","<p>HF transmissions from the ground can be reflected by the ionosphere leading to very long distance propagation. Satellites in low Earth orbit (160 km to 2,000 km)  fly within the ionosphere (60 km  to 1,000 km); with the F layer at 150 km to 500+ km.</p>

<p>So if a satellite is under, over or in the F layer, do the signals get absorbed, reflected away from the earth, or skim around/under the ionosphere (i.e. propagate a long distance)?</p>

<p>This would also depend on the incidence angle,  presumably.</p>

<p>The reason I ask is I am wondering if HF would be useful for in CubeSats, which at UHF frequencies can only downlink/load during short pass windows. HF would probably be a lower bandwidth connection, but the time available, and the more constant connection might outweigh the low bandwidth.  </p>
","<p>Satellites can and do use HF for communications.</p>

<p>The first example would of course be <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/?title=Sputnik_1"">Sputnik</a>, which transmitted at 20 and 40 MHz.</p>

<p>Amateurs use HF to communicate with satellites. According to <a href=""http://www.amsat.org/amsat/intro/sats_faq.html#RTFToC5"">Amsat</a>,  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>mode A: This mode requires a 2 meter SSB/CW transmitter and a 10 meter SSB/CW receiver...</p>
  
  <p>Mode K; This mode requires a 15 meter SSB/CW transmitter and a 10 meter SSB/CW receiver... This mode is unique in that it can be done with a simple HF rig.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>HF has advantages in its smaller Doppler shift, and reduced path loss, allowing omnidirectional antennas to be used more easily.</p>

<p>For the physics part of your question: the reflection from a layer of the ionosphere depends on electron density,  frequency and angle of incidence (which changes its effective thickness).</p>

<p>At normal incidence, frequencies of below about 7-10 MHz are reflected, higher frequencies pass through. See <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosonde"">Wikipedia</a> for a graph of reflection against height.<br>
<a href=""http://www.radio-electronics.com/info/propagation/ionospheric/maximum-lowest-critical-optimum-usable-working-frequency.php"">This page</a> gives a great overview; (written with communication in mind, but what isn't reflected is transmitted). The equation for MUF is F_normal / ( sec θ ). So it's only for very long paths, grazing reflection, that the ionosphere ever reflects a 28 MHz signal. It would usually pass straight through the ionosphere, down to a fairly shallow angle.</p>

<p>Your last question makes it sound like you hope to use HF from a cubesat when it's <em>over the horizon</em>, not in <em>line of sight</em>. This would be highly unusual and would certainly not help with your data rate problem.</p>

<ol>
<li>If you choose a frequency which easily penetrates the ionosphere, then it won't bounce around inside, to get to you, it'll just reflect out again.  </li>
<li>Cubesats have very limited power, HF requires plenty of power to communicate around the world, 10s or 100s of watts.  </li>
<li>If you're trying to send more data during a pass, then the right solution is to go <em>higher</em> in frequency, where antenna gains are higher, there's less atmospheric noise, and more bandwidth available. HF modems run at 1200 bps, WiFi runs at 11 Mbps and more.</li>
</ol>

<p>That all said, there is <a href=""http://www.arrl.org/news/australian-pico-balloon-piques-ham-radio-interest"">one tiny balloon project</a>, launched to fly around the southern hemisphere, that uses HF to phone home. It's only 30 km high, but it transmits just a few mW using wspr, and can be heard around the world, with luck. Bear in mind that it sends nothing but its position and callsign.</p>

"Height and feedline loss tradeoff for VHF","348","","<p>Currently my 2m antenna is about 3m above the ground inside, my HF antenna is connected to 30m (2db loss) coax and is about 12m up. Since the loss for 2m is a lot more when traveling down such a long piece of coax will moving my 2m antenna to the same mast as the HF antenna be worth the gain in height?</p>
","<p>I'm not a feed line guru, but I'm not sure your question as its worded now has an academicly ""correct"" answer anyway as it's a matter of owner preference and local conditions.</p>

<p>You should clarify what you want from your VHF setup. If you can already effectively work all your local repeaters and are not concerned with simplex coverage, then maybe it won't be worth relocating your VHF antenna for you.</p>

<p>If you are concerned about simplex coverage for emergency use when repeaters could be down, then the height improvement may be worth any potential feed line loss to you.</p>

<p>If your living conditions or significant other require you to move the antenna for space/placement reasons, the top of the tower may be nice and out of the way.</p>

<p>You will need to weigh these benefits and costs against your desired performance.</p>

<p>Of course if you are running inexpensive feed line with your VHF antenna <em>indoors</em>, moving it outside with good quality feed line may not cost you anything more than you are already losing with the antenna indoors! So its just a matter of cash and time to mount it right.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT After comments:</strong> Taking into account your clarification in the comments above, I would say getting the antenna outdoors and replacing the ""car kit"" feed line with quality low loss feed line will likely give you an all around better setup. <a href=""http://www.arrl.org/feed-lines"" rel=""nofollow"">ARRL seems to recommend Belden 9913 or LMR-400</a>. ""For base stations in particular, always buy the lowest-loss coax you can afford."" - from that same ARRL page.</p>

<p>I've seen more than a few people put a VHF vertical above the apex of a dipole on a tower. But hopefully someone more knowledgeable than I can advise on a recommended minimum separation distance. If you can keep the vertical a few feet above the dipole that will help reduce any interaction between them. </p>

<p>Whatever separation distance you can achieve, I'd be pretty confident your setup will improve getting your antenna outside with better feedline.</p>

"Is it safe to mount an active scanning antenna close to an hf antenna?","343","","<p>I live in the centre of a seaside town in the UK. Because of lack of space I have a random wire antenna in the loft of a small house, and pick up a lot of noise on the top band Sunday morning CW ragchew. I am about twenty hilly miles from most of my friends and the noise overwhelms many of their signals. I have a Maplin ""Super Scan Mk2"" all band vertical antenna with a built in amplifier chip, which I have never used. I would like to try mounting the Maplin antenna on a pole a few feet above the roof to see if I can cut down the noise on reception. Normally I run 25 Watts on transmission.</p>

<p>My rig is an Elecraft K2 with KPA100, which has a separate dedicated receive antenna socket, so no RF will be transmitted directly into the Maplin antenna.</p>

<p>So, my question is: is the RF from my own transmission into the loft antenna likely to damage the nearby Maplin antenna internal amplifier chip during my tests?</p>
","<p>Generally speaking you should not place an active antenna near a transmitting antenna unless you know the active antenna can handle the power. Some can, but most, particularly generic wideband scanner antennas, aren't intended to be used near transmitting antennas and the input stage may be easily damaged with a powerful transmission.</p>

<p>Specifically discussing the antenna you mention, reports online indicate that this active antenna <em>is</em> sensitive to nearby transmitters:</p>

"Pirate Radio vs Ham Radio","338","","<p>I've recently came across the terms ""Pirate Radio"" and in the URL of this page, ""Ham Radio"". What is the difference between these terms? And what is the difference between the transmission of a Pirate Radio and a Ham Radio.</p>
","<p>There is a very clear difference.  </p>

<p>I am a Ham Radio operator.  It is vernacular to mean an Amateur Radio licensee.  I have had to pass tests to earn the privileges to operate within parameters such as power levels in specific frequency bands.  It is a great hobby and I highly recommend it for anyone.  Entry is not too difficult.  It is designed to be that way.  And people that do not play by the rules do not last in this hobby.  Prime directive is to never cause interference to any other licensed service.  </p>

<p>Pirate radio is a whole different animal.  They are people who think the airwaves belong to everybody so they just set up things like broadcast stations.  Sometimes they cause interference to other stations.  Sometimes they pick a clear frequency so they dont.  But either way, they are illegal.  The Federal Communications Commission can levy fines on them and warn them to stop.  If they do not, then their equipment is subject to seizure and forfeiture.  Not a good way to get on radio.</p>

<p>The biggest difference in the transmission of Ham Radio vs Pirate Radio comes down to two things:  Operation within power limits that are licensed to Hams vs Pirates who exceed the Part 15 limits that govern things like garage door openers.  And the second thing is the transmission of music.   Hams are not allowed to do that.  Pirate Radio stations usually do.</p>

<p>Hope that clears it up for you.</p>

<p>My advice:  Look into joining the thousands of us Hams who enjoy having legal communications any time we choose.  It works when the phones are out, cellphone towers are not working, etc.  I, personally, have a solar power plant so I can operate for days on batteries.  There are a lot of aspects to the hobby.  </p>

<p>Check it out.  You may like what you see.  Better yet, find a local amateur radio club in your area and attend a meeting to see what the fuss is all about.  Guaranteed you will meet some interesting people.</p>

"Is there any downside to getting a vanity callsign?","335","","<p>I just got my HAM license, and I have been thinking about getting a 1×3 vanity that I can remember more easily.</p>

<p>This question is partially in reference to <a href=""http://wireless.fcc.gov/services/index.htm?job=call_signs_3&amp;id=amateur&amp;page=1"" rel=""noreferrer"">this passage on the FCC site</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A club station trustee of a club that has been assigned a vanity call sign is not eligible to apply for any additional vanity call signs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At first glance, this seems to mean that you cannot have a personal vanity call sign and a club station vanity callsign, but I'm skeptical about my ability to properly interpret this language.</p>

<p>More broadly, my question is that if I get a vanity callsign, is there any reason I might regret it later on or be restricted from certain things (for example, getting a different vanity callsign later on)?</p>
","<p>I can't think of any downside, no.  And that rule does not prevent you from picking one right now, whether or not you become a club station trustee in the future.</p>

<p>Myself, I have had three different callsigns.  My first two were the great in Morse but this last one is horrible in it.  But it works fine for voice.  </p>

<p>But I never thought about wanting to change what they gave me, any more than I would change the name my mama gave me.  The Funny Candy Company gives, and I took.  Kinda like the Army.  </p>

<p>So if you do decide to pick a callsign, do your research, and as you are looking, think about what it will ""mean"" - Like this:  My second callsign xxxIWL ended in ""I Want Love"" and my current callsign xxxEM ends in ""Easy Money"" when I was younger, and ""ElMer"" now.  Whatever you pick, be prepared to live with it for a while.   </p>

<p>That rule you cited deals specifically with amateur radio club station trustees, as you pointed out.  But that rule is after-the-fact.  Right now you are before-the-fact as you pick your first vanity call.  Then later, while your vanity callsign is being used by a club, you could not then try to get another vanity call for yourself.  You could withdraw as the club's station trustee and force the club to use someone else's callsign, of course, but you can't have two callsigns at the same time.  </p>

<p>You will not be restricted in any other way.</p>

<p>So let me tell you a story about how I used my callsign in a couple of very public ways.  And why I am so glad it works so well in voice and visually in digital and on my car.  You might find an idea or two in this:</p>

<p>First of all are the vanity plates for your car.  Most states will give them to you for free.  <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=fcc%20%22amateur%20radio%20is%20a%20public%20service%22"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Amateur Radio is a public service</a>.  And by free, I mean that in Alaska they are totally free.  Not even the normal license plate fees.  </p>

<p>I had vanity plates my whole driving life.  </p>

<p>Second, I also worked with the Alaska Division of Emergency Services, and the National Guard building packet BBS ID'd itself with my callsign for about a decade.  </p>

<p>Packet radio rules are a lot like repeaters.  You don't always have to be there; you are required to have positive control at all times, and the operation can be automatic.  Also, I had to append a ""-1"" to my callsign for the PBBS; the ADES packet BBS was xxxEM-1 so I would be allowed to check into it from home or my car using my own callsign.   </p>

<p>We actively sought out local hams when there were disasters, like the 37,000 acre Big Lake wildfire.  </p>

<p><a href=""https://www.fcc.gov/general/amateur-radio-services-and-public-safety-communications"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The FCC established amateur radio as a voluntary, non-commercial, radio communications service. It allows licensed operators to improve their communications and technical skills, while providing the nation with a pool of trained radio operators and technicians who can provide essential communications during emergencies.</a></p>

<p>Alaska has embraced that concept.  The Packet BBS was a great way to get messages out to large numbers of civilians, and to organize volunteers.  Since it was operated from the SEOCC at Ft. Richardson, adjacent to the AST dispatch center, it became a great way to send out sitreps and collect information for use in decision-making by the Incident Commanders.  </p>

<p>Back to the vanity license plates, the responders in the field are always glad to be able to quickly look at a car and see that it is a ham and not just anyone.  They have come to rely on our help.  As you get closer then they  can look at your window sticker, if you have rank, to determine whether or not to salute.  But by then they are at ease because hams are pretty much a known quantity.  People who violate the rules do not last in this hobby.</p>

<p>Once you get your preferred callsign, my advice is to get those plates. You have the ticket.  So now you have the right to display it for all to see.</p>

<p>No matter what you choose to do let me say <strong>Welcome to the community.</strong>  I trust you will enjoy being a ham for years to come.</p>

","<p>The traditional ""No balun"" G5RV design is famous (infamous, more like) for these sorts of quirks, primarily because the claim that it behaves in various different (and universally desirable) ways at different frequencies is a crock. In reality, it has two modes, a balanced dipole when used on a frequency where SWR (and in theory, common mode current) is low (30 and 17m on the Lite), and a sort of Frankenstein vertical (driven by common mode) and dipole (driven by the differential mode) everywhere else. That second mode is unpredictable at best, because the coax shield is just hanging there begging to act as part of the antenna, and the ladderline likes to radiate to varying degrees depending on frequency and severity of imbalance.</p>

<p>In your case, a quick model suggests you've got several hundred ohms of inductive reactance at the junction between the coax and ladderline at 21MHz, which may be more than your tuner can handle.</p>

<p>The best way to handle this would be to extend the ladder line to the shack window, or as close as you can get it, place a good quality 2 core 4:1 current balun there, and then run a short length of low loss coax like RG-213 in to the tuner. This should drastically reduce your feedline losses, and generally results in a much broader useful bandwidth overall. In your case, if this model is even remotely close to accurate, you're likely losing more than 50% of your power in the coax run, even if you're using just 50 feet of RG-8X in the current setup.</p>

<p>The ""band aid"" solution would be to place a bit of capacitive reactance across the ladderline to counteract the inductive reactance. I'm not sure exactly how much capacitance you might need, as that's going to be highly situation dependent. I would recommend using a variable capacitor at low power to determine how much is necessary to get below 4:1 or so, and then swap the variable capacitor out for a fixed capacitor with at least a 1kV voltage rating when you want to run 15 meters, and remove it otherwise.</p>

<p>A final (and maybe optimal) solution, but requiring substantial financial investment, would be to place a remote tuner like an Icom AH-4 or LDG RT-100 at the point where the ladderline from the G5RV ends, and run coax to the tuner. This is probably the best of all worlds, keeping coax loss low, giving maximum bandwidth, making it easy to isolate the coax from the antenna, and eliminating the frustrations of running ladderline long distances.</p>

<p>I'm asking in relation to making transmitters.  I'm sure a crystal (20ppm) is more than sufficient, but should I decide to make a simpler oscillator, how much error is permissable?</p>

<p>If you want to add how much error is preferable for a given activity (DX, contests, rag chewing, etc) then that's fine, but please note that I'm primarily interested in what my license permits, rather than what other operators might prefer (at this time, anyway).</p>
","<p>Your frequency error is the difference between where your transmitter indicates you are transmitting, and where you actually are transmitting.</p>

<p>The FCC does not regulate where you think you are transmitting. They only regulate where you are <em>actually transmitting</em>. Consequently, your frequency error can be whatever you want, as long as you keep it in the bands permitted by your license.</p>

<p>If you are concerned about drift during a transmission, I wouldn't. Anything you build today is almost certainly more stable than tube equipment that was built decades ago. Your problem with drift will be that the other station can't follow you before it is violation of any regulation.</p>

"What happens in a low loss feed-line with a high SWR","328","","<p>I was recently reading an interesting <a href=""http://www.arrl.org/files/file/Technology/tis/info/pdf/q1106037.pdf"">article</a> from the ARRL to get a better understanding of the SWR.</p>

<p>The following case is still unclear:
A low loss feed-line with an impedance that doesn't match the antenna's impedance and the receiver's impedance.</p>

<p>In this case a large part of the signal should ""bounces"" back and forth into the feed-line due to the impedance mismatch. At this point the article states that: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The energy bounces
  back and forth inside the cable until it’s all
  radiated by the antenna for a lossless transmission line. An important point to realize
  is that with extremely low loss transmission
  line, no matter what the SWR, most of the
  power can get delivered to the antenna.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand that during each ""bounce"", due to the impedance mismatch, some amount of energy will be transmitted and the rest reflected.</p>

<p>I don't understand how this transmitted power could be useful. After ""bouncing"" back and forth the part of the signal that will be transmitted will probably be out of phase with the signal sent by the transmitter. Even if by any luck the reflected signal and the signal currently sent by the transmitter happened to be in phase, the information conveyed wouldn't be the same. </p>

<p>So to me, even if almost of the power is transmitted, due to the high SWR most of this power should be just noise and don't improve the quality of the transmission in any case. But it's not what the article seems to explain. What did I miss ? </p>
","<p>For many modulations, the modulation is very slow compared to the propagation delay of the feedline. For example, SSB is typically limited to no more than 4 kHz. That corresponds to a wavelength of of 75 km. As long as the feedline is significantly shorter than this, then the delay due to the feedline is negligible.</p>

<p>It may be easier to understand intuitively in a digital case. For example, PSK31 sends 31.25 symbols per second. 31.25 Hz corresponds to 9600 km, meaning by the time you are sending a bit, the previous bit is 9600 km away.</p>

<p>This breaks down for very high-speed modulations. For example, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8VSB"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">8VSB</a> modulation used by HDTV broadcasts transmits 10.76 million symbols per second, equivalent to a 29 meter wavelength. At these speeds, a feedline is long enough to introduce significant delay, which could come out looking like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipath_propagation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">multipath distortion</a>. Then again, TV channels are 6 MHz wide. Most amateur transmissions are several orders of magnitude narrower. Protip: don't operate your commercial TV broadcast station with a poorly matched feedline.</p>

<p>But for most amateur transmissions, we can consider the transmission as a pure sine wave, which is a reasonable approximation given the timescales dictated by the length of the feedline and the modulation. Then, it helps to visualize what a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_wave"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">standing wave</a> in the feedline looks like. <a href=""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Standing_wave_2.gif#mediaviewer/File:Standing_wave_2.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">From Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<p>If we regard the transmitter to be on the left and the antenna to be on the right, then the blue wave represents the transmitted wave, and the red wave the reflected wave.</p>

<p>Now here's the thing to realize: this particular image depicts a <em>complete</em> standing wave on a <em>lossless</em> transmission line. In this case, we are delivering 0 power to the antenna, the VSWR is infinite, and the transmitter's finals are probably about to explode. This doesn't happen in practice because our antennas always accept at least <em>some</em> of the power.</p>

<p>In practice, only <em>some</em> of the power is reflected back, and the result is a <em>partial standing wave</em>. <a href=""http://www.acs.psu.edu/drussell/Demos/SWR/SWR.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Dan A Russel has a page of great animations</a>, like this one:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ukfVt.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>In the case of a <em>partial</em> standing wave, we can see that the envelope (outlined by the dotted lines) does not reach 0 amplitude at the nodes. In this case, some power is transferred. This is also a good visualization of VSWR: it is the ratio of the voltage amplitude at the antinodes (envelope maximums) to the voltage amplitude at the nodes (envelope minimums).</p>

<p>Notice also that the reflected wave might arrive back at the transmitter in any phase, depending on the length of the feedline and the antenna's reflection coefficient. It may or may not be in phase, but it will be a <em>constant</em> phase, not just noise. By adding an antenna tuner we can reflect the reflected wave back at the antenna, and adjust the phase of this re-reflected wave to be whatever we want, within the limits of the tuner's capabilities of course.</p>

"Minimal info on a SWL QSL","323","","<p>Which is the minimal information I should require to confirm/QSL a reception report I receive ?</p>

<p>I know the report must contain my callsign, time, date and band where I was listened. Is it also a requirement to indicate the callsign of the other participant in the QSO ?</p>

<p>I am receiving some QSLs without this last info. This makes sometimes difficult to confirm if the listener actually heard me. For example, In those occasions I stay the full day glued to my rig, without other information, any time would match. </p>
","<p>Usually when listening to DX on the bands, a listener will note the DX station as well as the station the DX station is working. Without this information it can be difficult for the DX station to look up their own transmission in their log.</p>

<p>For example, the other day I heard a weak station on 17m CW - ET3AA, quite rare, and difficult to work from here (Thailand). He was not particularly busy, and was rather weak. I heard him going through a few contacts, but I only really heard the prefixes of the stations he was working (UA4, DL, G), as I was trying to work him myself.</p>

<p>I was lucky that he heard my weak signals after about 45 minutes, but if I had completely failed to work him after an hour, and sent him an SWL QSL card instead saying ""I heard you on 18MHz at 1430Z on 2015-07-07"", he might have thought ""yeah, I was on 18MHz at that time, that's a good one"". But conversely he might have thought ""you heard me? So who was I working??"" and not send a QSL in response.</p>

<p>For a QSL sent to an amateur DX station, I would expect to see as a minimum: The DX Callsign, Date, Time, Frequency Band (or better yet, actual frequency), Mode and Station Worked by the DX station. Without that the DX station can not usually guarantee that they were actually heard at that time/date/frequency/mode, as they can't cross-check it with their own log.</p>

<p>One exception to this is if a DX station is calling CQ and you hear them - if you were to send an SWL QSL to them, they might not even HAVE a log entry for what frequencies/dates/times/modes they call CQ. Most logging software these days is all about QSOs, and not so much about procedural stuff like ""station on/off times"" or ""calling CQ"" or ""started/stopped packet software on 2m"" or whatever. Back in the days of paper logs, such things were regularly logged.</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wullenweber"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wullenweber circularly-disposed antenna arrays (CDAAs)</a> are large HF direction-finding antennas, sometimes colloquially referred to as ""elephant cages"", that were popular in the Cold War.  They allowed the bearing of an incoming signal to be located to perhaps 0.5° (for the US Navy's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AN/FRD-10"" rel=""noreferrer"">AN/FRD-10</a>).  I've been fascinated by them ever since I saw the one on the Silver Strand south of San Diego, California.  Dozens were built all over the world.  Now nearly all have been demolished.  The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AN/FLR-9"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia article for the US Air Force's AN/FLR-9</a> says ""advances in technology have made the FLR-9 obsolete.""</p>

<p>What advances in technology made Wullenweber CDAAs obsolete?  What technologies are used for military HF direction finding now?</p>

<p>EDIT: I'm talking about <em>fundamental</em> advances in technology.  I presume if the technology were still broadly useful, then the electronics would be modernized.  To rephrase the question, why do modern militaries not use giant circular antenna arrays for HF direction finding any more?  What do they use instead?</p>
","<p>First of all: why is it surprising that a radio device built in the 1960s has become obsolete?</p>

<p>I don't know the specific reasons why this specific type of direction finder has become obsolete, but among these reasons might simply be:</p>

<ul>
<li>cost of renovation > benefit</li>
<li>Shift in strategic demand for localization of these boring HF signals</li>
<li>instead of a few circular setups, a lot of smaller setups can actually do the same or a lot better. We can now phase-synchronize distributed receiver systems through e.g. GPS. That wasn't possible in the 60s!</li>
<li>distributed smaller multi-antenna systems allow for actual localization instead of just direction finding; the localization happens inherently and with less error instantly, instead of detecting multiple directions of arrival on multiple old systems, and then crossing lines on a map, manually, after communicating these bearings.</li>
<li>terrible, terrible receiver bandwidth, noise, power consumption, reliability, operation cost. (best case: noisy germanium transistors. More likely in the early 60s: tube amps that eat kW of power for such a big receiver array). Noise Figure 7dB for a low-bandwidth receiver? That's not even remotely good nowadays.</li>
<li>Operation manual suggest these amplifiers are lock-in amplifiers, and thus would be unsuitable for everything but AM and low-modulation index FM, and thus especially unsuitable for digital communications, probably.</li>
<li>terrible antenna setup for systems where computational power allows to get higher resolution with fewer antennas</li>
<li>antennas optimized for narrowband reception. Modern RF localization systems can track and find a lot of signals at once, spread over a large bandwidth, with a single set of antennas, through DSP</li>
<li>Have you seen how <strong>large</strong> these are? They're positively a big waste of space.</li>
<li>Resolution of this system is very bad (15dB directional gain of the beamforming system) compared to modern 3-antenna setups, which are smaller, cheaper. Manual says ""nominal resolution 4°"". That is seriously sub-par for anything built since the 90s with that many antennas to increase resolution.</li>
<li>analog beamforming depends on physical properties of a system that are hard to maintain over time, and costly to re-calibrate</li>
<li>availability of mobile systems that are better</li>
<li>seriously, these are from the early/mid sixties. That's 50 years in the past. Even with ever so slight improvements in technology, it's not very likely that these would still be on par with modern technology. We have better

<ul>
<li>cables,</li>
<li>lacquer,</li>
<li>power supplies,</li>
<li>displays,</li>
<li>operation monitoring,</li>
<li>building materials,</li>
<li>thermal isolation,</li>
<li>cooling,</li>
<li>antenna materials,</li>
<li>antenna simulation and</li>
<li>measurement tools,</li>
<li>higher construction placement accuracy<br><br>
just to name a few things where there has been gradual, but not necessarily revolutionary improvements with respect to construction of antenna array systems in the last, I repeat, <strong>50</strong> years.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>It's really no surprise that the military has adopted different systems since then.</p>

<p>Generally, however, CDAAs aren't obsolete – circular antenna sets still have nice properties when paired with the appropriate DSP algorithms. Thus, they are still in active usage in SIGINT; it's really just that 1960's analog systems are really not relevant anymore.</p>

"What is the body of knowledge the U.S. written exams test?","320","","<p>I'm considering getting a U.S. amateur radio operator license.</p>

<p>If you want to <em>study to pass a license test</em>, there are many resources to learn the answers to the entirety of the question pool: online practice exams and study aids, “ham cram” courses, etc. I came across one document (not quickly finding the link again) which basically takes the entire question pool and rephrases each question into a paragraph which briefly describes the broader topic and gives the question and answer as an example of that topic.</p>

<p>But I've looked through the question pool, and it seems obvious to me that the questions are not comprehensive; just like any test one might find in school, they are intended to <em>sample</em> your grasp of a larger body of knowledge. So, where's a copy of the syllabus for “U.S. Amateur Radio 101”?</p>

<p><strong>What topics <em>should</em> the holder of a Technician, General, or Extra license have knowledge of?</strong> What would be the content of the question pool if test-takers had infinite patience, and could be tested on every fact rather than a sampling?</p>

<p>Or, addressing my actual plans: <strong>what topics should I ensure are contained in my study materials,</strong> given that</p>

<ul>
<li>I remember best when I have theory rather than only disconnected facts,</li>
<li>and I've looked at what the question pool is testing and it seems worthwhile to me to also know the material that obviously could be in the pool, but happens not to be,</li>
<li>but I also fully expect to learn just-in-time as I start projects, so material which is neither on the test nor “you need to know not to do this” is a lower priority.</li>

","<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I think that they body of knowledge they are testing may once have been fairly focused, but it has become a bit muddled by attempts to include new technologies without completely losing touch with the roots of the hobby.  At least that is my perspective as someone who took the Tech exam, then the General 4 weeks later and the Extra 4 weeks after that.</p>

<p>A simple summary is this:</p>

<ul>
<li>The rules (FCC Part 97)</li>
<li>Operating practices, including customs not required by FCC rules</li>
<li>Amateur radio ""technology"": operating modes, types of antennas, etc.</li>
<li>Enough physics to understand propagation and basic electronics</li>
<li>Basic electronics sufficient to understand, build and maintain basic radio equipment</li>
<li>Safety practices (physical, electical and RF)</li>
</ul>

<p>For someone who's technically oriented, the new material is really just the first 3 items.  Like you I wanted to be sure I understood the material so I could fully participate.  As you have already guessed, it's completely impractical to comprehensively test anyone.  Again, as a new ham myself, some glaring omissions in the testing is actual operating practices: how to get onto a repeater and what the protocol is for participating, similar for HF nets, contest rules and practices, what the heck are all these knobs for on this radio?</p>

<p>I think in other countries they include a practical portion on the test and these things have to be known in advance.  I didn't have an Elmer (teacher/mentor), I just got the books and did the tests and didn't get a radio until I was a General, so all this had to be learned on the fly and took a while.  If you have access to a live ham, this part will go a lot more smoothly for you.  I am still learning what some of these knobs do 6 months later...</p>

<p>As @Phil Frost related, it's pretty easy to just pass the test if that's your goal.  The US tests are 4 distractor multiple choice tests with 74% for mastery.  So you need only 28 out of 35 for the Technician and General tests and 37 out of 50 on the Extra class test. The tests are constructed such that each section of the material is represented by at least one question.   </p>

<p>Could I use my VFO with a commercial rig?

","<p>This falls under the heading of ""Depends on the Commercial Rig""... Some commercial Ham gear is equipped with a connection for external VFO, so for those it's a ""plug and play"" solution. For other gear it would depend on your ability to find the correct spot in the signal chain to inject the signal from your VFO. I know of hams who have built a DDS VFO and added it to old crystal controlled commercial VHF radios to get a very nice, rugged, rig. 
Things to be aware of if you go this route are that the VFO frequency will need to be offset from the receive frequency (by the 1st IF freq.). Also, VHF/UHF rigs may also need the VFO to run at a sub multiple of the ""tuned"" frequency. (Common practice in crystal controlled rigs is to multiply the crystal frequency with analog multipliers.)
Most of the DDS kits around have this ability built into the controller firmware.</p>

"How to center-feed a single wire dipole?","317","","<p><a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/a/1900/218"">I have heard</a> that it is possible to feed single wire like a dipole from the center-point without actually making two separate wires. </p>

<p>How would I do this, what impedance would I expect to see, and what matching technique should I use to keep it at 50 ohms. </p>

<p>I would expect a very low impedance because of a DC short, with wires right next to each other but I know that changes with RF.</p>
","<p>There are several ways to do this, but given your <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/q/1897/218"">previous question</a>, we can reasonably assume that:</p>

<ol>
<li>your wires won't be resonant at your desired frequency</li>
<li>you desire operation on a number of bands anyway</li>
<li>even if your wires <em>were</em> resonant, there are several nearby parallel wires that are going to alter the impedance from a theoretical dipole</li>
<li>you aren't going to dig up your patio to install a counterpoise, nor do you have much more space to install a new antenna or extend the existing wires</li>
</ol>

<p>Given all of this, I think your easiest solution would be to pick one of those wires, and place another wire closer and parallel to it, shorting it on the ends. This makes a <a href=""http://www.antenna-theory.com/antennas/foldeddipole.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">folded dipole</a>, which does have a center feed, but which does not require that you cut the existing wire.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FaIDV.jpg"" alt=""folded dipole""></p>

<p>The unbroken conductor is your existing wire; the parallel wire with the feedpoint is a wire you add. Keep them roughly parallel with some non-conductive spacers.</p>

<p>Inherent in a folded dipole is an impedance step-up, since only some of the current flows in the half with the feed. If you make the wire you add smaller, then you get a greater impedance step-up. If you make the wire you add equal in diameter, then you get a 4:1 step-up. For ""fat"" wire you could use just the shield of some cheap coax. Flat braided wire could work also.</p>

<p>I'd run this, via ladder-line, to a tuner. This will allow you load up your wires on just about any band and get reasonable performance. Ladder line works better than coax in this application since it has much lower loss and is cheaper, and the SWR on the transmission line could be pretty high.</p>

<p>Another option would be a delta match. Simply take your ladder line feed and cut it down the middle for some length. Then attach the two ends at some points centered on the wire:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/n99ke.gif"" alt=""delta match""></p>

<p><em><a href=""http://www.radio-electronics.com/info/antennas/yagi/yagi-feed-impedance-matching.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">image source</a></em></p>

<p>You can think of this working as an autotransformer, with the dipole being a single-turn, straight inductor. By adjusting the connection points you can get different feed impedances. This was, back in the day, a very popular way to feed a half-wave dipole with 600-ohm ladder line. Find the best arrangement by experimentation.</p>

<p>Another option, since you seem to have multiple parallel wires: connect the ends of some of them together, making a loop. Leave a gap in one of the wires you add for the feedpoint. Or, feed it with a delta, as above.</p>

<p>Or, don't make a loop. Just connect one end, forming a ""U"". Now you can make a center-fed, bent dipole.</p>

","<p>It refers to <strong>'smoothed' sunspot number</strong>, and is needed by many software utilities to calculate optimal propagation.

When the number is high, the whole HF range up to 30 MHz can be used usually around the clock and F2 propagation up to 50 MHz is observed frequently depending upon daily solar flux 10.7cm radiation values. During solar minima, or minimum sunspot counts down to zero, propagation of frequencies above 15 MHz is generally unavailable. </p>

<p>In other words, high levels of sunspot activity lead to better signal propagation on HF bands, although they also increase the levels of solar noise and ionospheric disturbances (caused by impact of the increased level of solar radiation on the ionosphere).</p>

<p>Can this same band be used for industrial-scientific-medical (ISM) purposes?</p>
","<p>ISM (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_band"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Industrial, Scientific, Medical</a>) is a pretty broad umbrella.  It is possible for devices to send data automatically on the ham 70cm band that you're talking about, but transmissions have to conform to the law.  The law varies somewhat from country to country, but there are certain rules in common:</p>

<ul>
<li>The sender must have a ham license</li>
<li>The transmissions must be identified by call sign periodically (every 10 minutes in the US)</li>
<li>Transmissions for pecuniary interest (for profitable or business purposes) are not allowed</li>
<li>Encrypted transmissions aren't allowed</li>
<li>Cursing isn't allowed</li>
<li>International third-party traffic (messages on behalf of someone in another country) are not allowed between some countries</li>
</ul>

<p>With all those rules, there isn't much legal use of ham bands as an ISM-band alternative.</p>

<p>EDIT: it turns out that some countries in ITU region 1 (Europe, Africa, the Middle East west of the Persian Gulf including Iraq, the former Soviet Union, and Mongolia) do have a small ISM band allocation from 433.05 MHz to 434.79 MHz, according to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_band"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>, which would seem to overlap the amateur radio 70cm band.  In countries that do have that ISM band allocation, then the answer to the question is yes: that narrow part of the ham band can be used for ISM purposes according to the laws that govern ISM operation.  So those ISM band users wouldn't need to identify with a call sign, but they would need to abide by ISM power limits and other rules.</p>

<p>It seems like it may work simply by grounding the base. Not sure if I would have to trim it a bit. </p>
","<p>The CB mag mount can be used on 10 meters by attaching a wire to the the shielding at the base then extending the wire to the side.  There is always some length that is resonant on whatever frequency desired.  On my particulat CB antenna the side wire was about twice the length of the vertical. Total length will be a bit longer than 8 feet (half-wave). </p>

<p>My very first contact as a ham was the Virgin Islands with this lashup taped on the roof of my motorhome.</p>

<p>Beside adjusting length I later found the up or down angle of the side wire can fine tune the SWR.  The signal pattern will be stronger in the semi-circle toward the side wire... Perhaps half as loud as away from the side wire.</p>

<p>If you try to extend the side wire to tune 12 or 15 meters the feedpoint will be considerably off-center. The impedance will likley be over 150 Ohms, too high for your internal tuner to handle.</p>

<p>The down side is that 10 meters is so quiet now that few hams are trying to work that band.  I now use a 20 meter version of that side-arm antenna and a 40-20-15-10 meter end-fed antenna for multi-band work.</p>

I'm guessing that even if the unit exceeds legal power limits there's almost zero chance of being caught since there'll be nobody out there except some hunters and campers and perhaps forest rangers. If caught, then I'm wondering if the authorities will take away my GPR. The GPR unit wouldn't be heard on radios since its at an extremely narrow BW. So the Rangers should be okay. They'll probably be more curious then anything else. At say 300MHz the GPR yagi antenna will be around  7 elements. </p>

","<p>An amateur ""ham"" radio license in the US will not allow the kind of transmission you are attempting to do.  Therefore, amateur radio is not your solution path.</p>

<p>The FCC regulations <a href=""http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;SID=336ab7469b61ecbfa15086dbf1bf2c59&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=47:5.0.1.1.6&amp;idno=47#47:5.0.1.1.6.1.157.1"" rel=""nofollow"">part 97</a> that covers the Amateur Radio Service dictates precisely the types of transmissions that can be made.  In particular, the purpose is maintain two-way communications between two stations.  At least one station must be a licensed amateur radio station and if the other station is not a licensed amateur radio station then it must fit into a very small category such as special MARS (Military Affiliated Radio Service) station, or possibly a licensed but non-amateur emergency services station where the amateur station is participating in emergency services communications.</p>

<p>Your desired transmission is called one-way in FCC Part 97 regulations and the only valid one-way communications allowed are each explicitly dictated by the regulations.  Operating a ground penetrating RADAR unit is not one of them.  These legal one-way transmissions are allowed for a variety of reasons such as:  brief test signals, transmissions designed to raise a responding licensed station, and a few other reasons.</p>

<p>The full detailed list of the legal and and restricted (illegal) transmissions made by an licensed amateur station are covered in paragraphs:  97.111 ""Authorized Transmissions""; 97.113 ""Prohibited Transmissions"".</p>

<p>Other specialized one-way transmissions include beacon stations outlined by paragraph 97.203; and a space station 97.207; a space telecommand station as described in 97.211; telecommand of model craft 97.217; and telemetry as described in 97.219.</p>

<p>Other than these sections I list here, there is other language such as the opening paragraphs, of FCC 97 that do not allow the type of transmissions you describe for a ground penetrating RADAR.</p>

<p>However, having said all this about amateur radio regulations, it is possible to obtain a special license for short-term usage of some band of frequencies for scientific experiment usage.  This would be by request to the FCC but I expect the format and content to be specific to the precise needs of the experiment, duration, and so forth.  Definitely not something for some general usage application.</p>

"Can I use a Hawaiian call sign on the mainland?","311","","<p>A ham is initially licensed in Hawaii as KH6ABC (example only).  If he subsequently moves to the mainland, can he keep his geographically restricted ""KH"" call sign or must it be changed?</p>
","<p>He or she can certainly keep the KH callsign and use it anywhere in the US and territories.  (I wonder if he or she thought that when operating in Samoa?  There are two sides there, as you probably know.  But since the non-American side is a territory the same rules apply.)    </p>

<p>Common convention is to append it with the location where the station (even a HT) is operating.</p>

<p>So, if in California, you might identify on SSB as ""KH6ABC slant 6"" so people won't pile up wanting Hawaii for WAS.</p>

<p>If in Morse code, you use the slash character, as in ""KH6ABC/6""    (-..-.)</p>

<p>But these are conventions, not rules.  So it is perfectly all right to just use your native callsign wherever you go in the US.</p>

<p>Outside the US, especially for events (such as climbing Mt. Everest) the entire expedition is generally given a callsign just for that event.  This is where WARC comes in.  It is not complicated but needs to be taken into account by the expedition leader.</p>

<p>Inside the US it is pretty simple.  Myself, I am AL7** and though am in California, ID myself as AL7**.</p>

<p>Where it gets interesting is if you to Alaska - where it would be ""KH6ABC/L7"" or ""KH6ABC slant L7.""   (L7 means Alaska, whether a wl7, kl7 or an al7).</p>

<p>The FCC requires that you identify yourself.  That's the end of the story with them.  Their goal is to encourage the hobby, not to fine people like with broadcast stations.</p>

<p>FYI, they are serious about ID requirements.  Simply keying up a repeater to see if you can reach it does not fit the criteria for lawful identification.  Enforcement actions are rare but can happen if it is deemed to be harmful interference.  </p>

<p>Here is an interesting story along those lines, in which an operator was fined for failure to identify:  <a href=""http://www.kg7ydj.us/2015/12/23/we-pause-for-this-station-identification-requirements-for-amateur-radio/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ID requirements</a></p>

"How to transmit images and video through a hurricane?","309","","<h3>Background</h3>

<p>You're in the path of a hurricane, and the eye just passed over your head. There is no electricity (apart from your own generator or battery), there is no mobile network and there is obviously no internet availability. But you do have a working computer with an SDR (20 MHz - 3 GHz) transmitter, Ham-it-up, a Wifi router, a mobile phone and an RPi3, and a few soldering skills.</p>

<h3>Questions:</h3>

<ol>
<li>How can I transmit text, audio, images or videos to the outside world? </li>
<li>What are the options available for this?</li>
<li>What else is required to construct (or have) to do this? (In terms of antennas and hardware etc.)</li>
</ol>

<p>First thought is that one should try to use an amateur satellite transmission, since that signal propagation would pass through least possible weather, i.e. straight up.</p>

<p>Second, that one should use some long wave TX that is less affected by local atmospheric conditions. </p>

","<p>In general, the HF bands (1.8 MHz through 30 MHz) do not have sufficient bandwidth to support live transmission of a video signal. In the US, the FCC does not authorize an emission mode for live video on HF. The lowest available band in the US that supports live video is 70 cm (~440 MHz).</p>

<p>There are, however, options for transmitting pictures on HF. One of the oldest modes is SSTV (slow scan television). Despite the ""TV"" designation, it is used for sending relatively low resolution, still images. While SSTV used to require significant hardware to implement a station, this has all been replaced by free software that uses a sound card interface. As a result, there still is significant SSTV activity on HF.</p>

<p>A more contemporary method of sending and receiving pictures on HF is with the FLdigi program. It offers user selectable resolution and it has 24 bit color. The integrity of the received image is based on the signal conditions. FLdigi is popular due to its free software and simple radio interface using a sound card.</p>

<p>PACTOR offers error correction capabilities that can improve digital file reception under varying link conditions. The cost to implement PACTOR is generally higher due to the HF modem that is required and the software licensing schemes of the various versions.</p>

<p>80 m is famously so wide that the phone segment of it gets called “75 meters” because the difference matters for antenna design.</p>

<p>I’ve heard that what matters for antenna and electronic design is the relative bandwidth — the ratio of the low and the high ends. I’d like to see what this ratio is for <em>all</em> of the amateur bands, and just how much of an outlier 80 m is or isn't.</p>

"Yaesu FT-60 Battery Life","309","","<p>What is the least voltage the FT-60 can be operated at?  In other words, what is the recommended voltage to change battery or charge?</p>

<p>Menu item number 12 (DC VLT) shows the amount of charge left in the battery and it also displays when the radio starts up.  </p>

<p>The radio is fully charged at 9 volts and I'm wondering what voltage to switch the battery at.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>The FT-60 manual says the battery pack is a NiMH pack (""FNB-83 (7.2 V, 1400 mAh)""); so, as we usually use 1.2V as the nominal voltage of a single NiMH cell, a pack of 6 cells in series.</p>

<p>You'd usually make sure not to discharge a NiMH below 1.0 – 1.1 V; going deeper can damage the cell. So, the minimal voltage for a pack of 6 in series would be 6.0 – 6.6V.</p>

<p>I'd very much expect your FT-60 (or the battery pack itself) to have a protection circuit that simply doesn't allow to deep-discharge your pack, i.e. your handset will very likely simply stop working as soon as the battery pack voltage drops to 6.0 V.</p>

<p>Regarding your 9 V: For charging, you have to apply a voltage slightly higher than what the batteries nominally supply (charging efficiency is chemically never 100%), so, when observing the voltage across the battery pack during charging, it should be > 7.2 V, and a bit lower, but still > 7.2 V for a short duration thereafter, but the voltage will drop very quickly as soon as you start drawing current from the battery, and then stay relatively constant (or rather: drop relatively slowly) between 7.2 V and 6.0 V.</p>

<p>This is all a bit approximate, since it depends on the making of the individual cells and the amount of current drawn, but generally, NiMH cells have a relatively flat ""discharge curve"" (i.e. after drawing an amount of mAh, how much voltage can be measured across the battery?).</p>

<p>The takeaway is that you can, optimally, just use the batteries until the FT-60 reports them ""flat"", not shorter, not longer. NiMH don't (as significantly) suffer from the ""memory effect"" that NiCd exposed, so there's nothing to be lost when you really just charge your batteries overnight, and then use them as long as they work.</p>

<p>Personally, with the moderate current drawn by the handset, and the voltage, I would've designed the device to work with LiIon batteries – these could pack more energy into the same size and weight than NiMH – and you'd have a longer talk time. However, LiIon is a bit harder to make safe, so that might have come out a bit more expensive. Then again, those batteries are what powers smartphones these days, so the economics of scale would probably have made them cheap.</p>

"antenna circuit to hear or show radio direction","308","","<p>Is it possible to create a circuit to hear (through earphones) or show (with an LED) the direction of a radio source?

Is it possible to locate WiFi, Bluetooth or ZigBee/XBee with this approach?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Is it possible to create a circuit to hear (through earphones) or show (with an LED) the direction of a radio source?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. There are basically two different types of direction finding techniques:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You can simply change the orientation of your antenna and observe whether this makes the received signal weaker or stronger. This has the advantage of working with any radio receiver, as long as either</p>

<ul>
<li>the receiver displays some indication of the received signal strength, or</li>
<li>your antenna is sufficiently directional (e.g. a Yagi or loop antenna) that it makes the signal strength drop enough to make the signal vanish under the noise. (In fact, when using a loop antenna, it is normal to look for that point, the <em>null</em>, because it is easier to hear the absence of the signal than when it is at maximum strength.)</li>
</ul>

<p>This method is commonly used by amateur radio operators who do it for fun, on foot (this goes under a number of names: foxhunting, T-hunting, radiosport); their equipment typically consists of a handheld transceiver, a Yagi or loop antenna, and a variable attenuator (to avoid overload when too close).</p></li>
<li><p>You can use a direction-finding receiver; this requires <em>at least two antennas</em> (or an antenna with multiple outputs, depending on how you look at it), connected to a receiver with multiple inputs, which compares the signal amplitude and phase to derive the direction information.</p>

<p>Amateur radio operators who do direction-finding in their vehicles (either as a sport or to locate interferers) often use the so-called “Doppler direction finder” design, which can give an indication of direction on LEDs, uses an array of four antennas, and passes through to an ordinary FM receiver to also listen to the signal.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Aircraft used to have an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_direction_finder#Automatic_direction_finder_.28ADF.29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">automatic direction finder (ADF)</a> as standard equipment. These may work on either of the above principles. They are not typically used for navigation today, having been replaced by VOR and GPS.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What does a really simple circuit look like and how does it work?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In general, any design for a radio receiver which has either an audio (if the signal is continuous, anyway) or signal-strength output can be used together with a directional antenna.</p>

<p><a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/questions/1610/how-would-a-time-difference-of-arrival-receiver-with-two-antennas-know-which-sid"">Here's another question on this site which happens to have a schematic of one two-antenna design</a> for a specialized receiver, and my answer discusses how it works and includes results of a simulation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How does the frequency of the radio source affect this circuit and antenna?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very loosely speaking, radio works the same at all frequencies. In practice,</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Lower frequencies are more likely to propagate long distances, pass through walls, refract around obstacles, and otherwise complicate direction finding. Higher frequencies act more like visible light, making it more straightforward to locate them <em>if</em> you can receive them.</p></li>
<li><p>Lower frequencies require larger antennas, making moving antennas less practical to use.</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it possible to locate WiFi, Bluetooth or ZigBee/XBee with this approach?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, but because these are packet protocols you will practically need receivers for the purpose, which can recognize the quick bursts and distinguish them from noise. You will also need the receiver to report the signal strength (RSSI); I understand this is commonly available but I haven't worked with this sort of packet radio hardware so I can't give any details.</p>

<p>In principle, you should be able to connect a standard module to a tiny directional antenna, write software to ask it for the RSSI of every packet it receives, and be ready to go. The trickiest part will be fabricating the correctly sized and correctly matched antenna (more or less depending on what test gear you have available).</p>

"How to probe a dipole antenna?","308","","<p>I want to start experimenting and tinkering with antennas, starting with ½ wave dipoles. I will be measuring the AC voltages on both the transmitter and the reciever antennas simultaneously. And by changing the distance between them, I will observe the phase angle and delay time (of the EM waves) between them.</p>

<p>As I started planning with no practical experience, I stumbled at each step. </p>

<p>I found this calibrated signal generator (<a href=""https://www.rf-consultant.com/calibrated-signal-generator/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.rf-consultant.com/calibrated-signal-generator/</a>) and Rigol DS1102E so that I will be able to work with 100 MHz. I know the scope is rated for 100 MHz but after reading this thread (<a href=""https://hackaday.io/project/4327-stretching-the-limits-of-a-rigol-ds-1102e-scope"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://hackaday.io/project/4327-stretching-the-limits-of-a-rigol-ds-1102e-scope</a>), I was convinced that it could work well even at higher frequencies (only if we are measuring with one channel).</p>

<p>First problem is how to connect the transmitter antenna to the signal generator. I will use a 50 ohm coax cable of small length. Since the waveform and directivity is not critical, could I get away without adding a balun? Or would there be a risk of damaging the signal generator with signal reflections  (it has  50 ohms and +10 dBm (0.01 Watts) output) ?</p>

<p>If no baluns is ok, I will simply split the coax inner wire and braid apart into a dipole antenna. Soldering would maybe introduce abrupt impedance changes. </p>

<p>Second and biggest problem is how to probe the antennas to see the voltage waveforms? Could I attach the probe directly on the transmitting antenna center? While measuring on the reciever antenna, could I attach the probe on the other end of the coax cable (because the probe cables could fall short of the distance between the antennas while making simultaneous measurements) ? </p>

<p>If I attach the probe to the inner wire of the coax, should I attach the ground clip to the braid? Or at 100MHz should I completely remove the ground clip to eliminate the inductive coupling of the “ground clip-antenna-probe” loop (see under the title “Beware using ground clips...” in <a href=""http://www.radio-electronics.com/info/t_and_m/oscilloscope/using-oscilloscope-scope.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.radio-electronics.com/info/t_and_m/oscilloscope/using-oscilloscope-scope.php</a>)?

</blockquote>

<p>A good signal generator should tolerate any impedance at all at its output (including a short circuit).</p>

<p>But you should still use a balun in your antenna design, because if you construct a dipole without a balun, then the feed line will act as an antenna element (along with all of the grounded chassis metal of your signal generator, and so on). This means that you will not be measuring the antenna design you think you are.</p>

<p>A balun for a dipole prevents this unwanted RF current, so that the antenna's behavior is independent of how it is connected (though the path of the part of the feed line near to the antenna still matters — just as does any nearby object). The same thing applies in reverse to a receiving antenna; both need baluns to be predictable.</p>

<p>Also note that the feed point impedance of a dipole is not (usually) 50 Ω, so you will have some reflections from the transmit antenna no matter what unless you use a suitable matching network at the feed point (which would usually be combined with the balun).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Second and biggest problem is how to probe the antennas to see the voltage waveforms? Could I attach the probe directly on the transmitting antenna center?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you do this you must do it on the unbalanced (coax, not antenna) side of the balun, otherwise the probe cable ground will upset the balance and radiate as I mentioned above.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While measuring on the reciever antenna, could I attach the probe on the other end of the coax cable (because the probe cables could fall short of the distance between the antennas while making simultaneous measurements) ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, you can. The normal sort of operation would be to connect the feed line coax to the oscilloscope input, without using an oscilloscope probe. You must include a 50 Ω load (‘terminator’) <em>at the oscilloscope's end of the cable,</em> either:</p>

<ul>
<li>a BNC tee and a terminator (which looks like a BNC male connector with a metal cap instead of a cable attached),</li>
<li>a feed-through terminator (typically more expensive; has a BNC male and female connector), or</li>
<li>an internal 50 Ω load provided by your oscilloscope (not a feature of your Rigol DS1102E).</li>
</ul>

<p>This will ensure there are no reflections, and you are making a realistic measurement. (Remember that ideally the antenna should also be matched to the cable's 50 Ω. If it is not, there will still not be reflections, but the received signal will not be as strong as in the matched condition — in exactly the same way as any receiver's antenna input of the same impedance.)</p>

<p>Alternatively, you could use the probe and a regular resistor as the load at the antenna's feed point; that would be awkward in general compared to using proper coax parts but might be easier to get started with the components you have on hand to set up an experiment.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I attach the probe to the inner wire of the coax, should I attach the ground clip to the braid? Or at 100MHz should I completely remove the ground clip to eliminate the inductive coupling of the “ground clip-antenna-probe” loop?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are using an oscilloscope probe for RF, you <em>must</em> have a ground connection (removing it is the worst case), and the connection should be as <em>short and parallel</em> as you can manage (least loop area).</p>

<p>As I mentioned above, the best option is to skip the probe and use a matched load. This is what you should do for your receiving antenna.</p>

<p>For your transmit antenna, if your balun has conveniently exposed wires you can hook onto them, but consider using a shorter ground lead to minimize the loop area — a custom bent piece of solid wire, coiled to fit snugly onto the shield around the <em>tip</em> of the probe rather than the ring farther back up the shaft where a regular ground lead attaches.</p>

<p>Another option is to obtain an oscilloscope-probe-to-BNC adapter (note that there are several sizes depending on your probe tip diameter) and use it together with a tee connector to tap off the signal.</p>

<hr>

<p>Also, since you want to compare phase, don't forget to consider the length of the cables to your oscilloscope. If you use cables of the same length and the same type of coax, then you know they have the same delay; in any other case you must account for the difference.</p>

<p>Why do hams prefer wavelength? Is this tradion or convention? Is it more accurate?</p>

<p>I have seen VHF frequencies referred to by wavelength and UHF frequencies referred to by frequency in the same sentence, thereby lacking consistency.</p>
","<p>Just to add to the answers already given; there used to be a practice to call ""CQ 40m"" indicating you are indeed on the 40m band, avoiding stations to comeback to your call if your transmitter would have harmonics... say in the 15m band... </p>

<p>This was obviously a long time ago, when filtering harmonics was more difficult, and more difficult to measure/tune when building/operating equipment... and probably license conditions were different then today's.</p>

<p>Still this practice can be heard on the bands today, although modern transmitters would not have harmonics (or should not have harmonics) outside the band. I guess old habits die hard, especially in Amateur Radio.</p>

<p>I guess the practice referring to the bands is also a matter of ""least effort to indicate"". Which is already discussed in previous answers. Far more practical to say ""I had some contacts on the 20m band"" is stead of ""I had some contacts between 14.000 MHz and 14.350 MHz""</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>or band name (ie VHF, UHF) to describe the signal.</p>

<p>To answer that part of the OP question: the indication of VHF/UHF, and respecively HF would be a too broad indication to be accurately describing the operating band.</p>

<p>If you would take HF alone, it would be 9 (or 10, or 11 bands) which are included, namely: 80m, 60m, 40m, 30m, 20m, 17m, 15m, 12m, 10m. Some will count the 6m band as HF and some will count the 160m as HF. Although I believe 6m is actually inside VHF and 160m is actually MF.</p>

<p>VHF would have 3, or 4 bands; 6m, 4m, 2m, and some regions will have an allocation at 220MHz.</p>

<p>And so on so forth; so the indicators ""VLF, LF, MF, VHF, UHV, and higher"" are not suitable for use for Amateur radio to indicate where you are operating, they do have their uses, and are used if a ""broad term"" is sufficient in the context of what is communicated...</p>

"TV strong station has no signal when coax is connected","301","","<p>Right, not directly ham radio related, but this puzzles my ham brain.  I have several TVs connected to a distribution amp connected to an outside antenna.  All but one work fine, and the one won't pull in the strong stations, but does fine with the weaker ones.  If I unscrew the F so that only the center conductor touches, it gets the strong stations as well.  I've been trying to come up with an explanation, but have failed so far.  I tried disconnecting all the other TVs (thinking it's a ground loop or something) with no success.  What would cause that and how would I fix it?</p>
","<p>Problem resolved.  I put a splitter in before the amp and put the problem TV on one output and the input of the amp on the other.  Now all TVs have all the appropriate channels.  I could probably have accomplished the same with an attenuator on the TV itself, but I don't have one so I went with the no-cost solution.</p>

"Can two FM radios transmit two separate PL tones at the same time, and be received by two radios with matching PL tones?","299","","<p>Can two FM radios transmit two separate PL tones, and be received by two radios with matching PL tones? Or will the receivers hear a mix of the two, or nothing at all?</p>
","<p>Assuming that the two transmitters operate at the same carrier frequency, and that the receivers receive similar power from each transmitter, then the FM signals will suffer <em>destructive interference</em> and the demodulated signal will be heavily distorted. PL tone, which is part of the transmitted signal, will also be lost.</p>

<p>If one of the RF signals gets to the receiver with much more power than the other transmission, then there is FM <em>masking</em>, where the stronger signal prevails and the weaker signal is undetected.</p>

<p>You cannot expect to receive a nice mix of the two transmitted signals in FM.</p>

<p>P.S. this is why aviation VHF uses AM and not FM. In AM, all received signals add up in the demodulated audio, so you can hear all signals at once.</p>

"Bridging LAN over ~1-2km distance","298","","<p>A friend of mine and I live across a lake from each other, and recently we thought it'd be fun to try and connect our computers together somehow across that distance.  Running cable from either side is expensive, difficult (no boat), and probably illegal (or is regulated in some boring way), so we thought radio would be a good approach to the problem.  We're aware that there are people selling products that solve this problem, we'd like to do as much of it ourselves as possible.  While we might be fairly technical when it comes to computers, radio stuff is certainly not our strongsuit.  Thus, we've decided to use this as a project to learn more about the subject.</p>

<p>Our goal is to somehow connect our LANs together via radio, as though there was an ethernet cable connecting our switches.  If possible, It'd also be neat to be able to expand the system so that we could relay from his place to, say the beach we go to that I can't see from my house, and maybe from that bridge somewhere further up the lake.  Our houses are in direct visual contact with each other, and my limited knowledge of radio suggests that we might try some sort of a directional antenna.  Other than that, I have no idea how to approach this project.  </p>

<p>While a solid and detailed set of instructions would be lovely, we'd much more prefer an answer that contained resources we could check out to learn more about what we're doing, what solutions to our problem are available, and how we might implement them ourselves.  Learning is the primary goal of this project, after all!</p>
","<p>My advice here is to avoid the amateur radio service completely and instead go with license-free spectrum, perhaps around 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz. There are more than enough WiFi products that can solve your problems.</p>

<p>My advice for research directions would be to look for let's say parabolic antenna for your band of interest:<br>
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/T4vmJ.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/T4vmJ.jpg"" alt=""TL-ANT5830B from TP-LINK""></a><br>
 plus an access point. For access point, my advice would be to look to one of the third-party GNU/Linux distributions for routers and similar equipment. Fro example OpenWRT. Then look for the devices on their supported list and find one you like. OpenWRT and the like will give you more than enough options to fine-tune the WiFi settings you have and will also be able to improve security in the long run. since they actually receive updates, unlike stock firmwares for cheap units. The down-side of this approach is that if you want modern features such as antenna diversity and spatial multiplexing, you'll need two to four antennas per AP, which can get costly. A ballpark price for an antenna could be around USD 50 plus maybe USD 50 to USD 100 for an AP, plus low-loss coaxial cabling and installation costs. Keep in mind that the traditional distance between antennas i  simpler diversity or multiplexing setups should be half of wavelength or odd multiple of it.</p>

<p>Or maybe a combination unit that has both WiFi card and an integrated outdoor directional antenna with sufficient gain could be interesting:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9pI0f.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9pI0f.png"" alt=""SXT SA5 ac""></a> </p>

<p>Such units will usually have wired Ethernet connection on them and can be powered over Ethernet using standardized PoE or their own proprietary power injectors. They can have several integrated antennas (pictured unit has two), meaning that they can take advantage of antenna diversity or spatial multiplexing in one unit, but it will be a somewhat compromise solution, since quite often, there's very little that can be done to have many uncorrelated antennas in small space. Price could be a bit higher than an access point plus one antenna, but will in general be lower than access point plus two good antennas. The pictured unit goes for around 115€, just to give you a reference point. Also with this type of solutions, you usually completely avoid the coaxial cable loss between the radio and the antenna, since the unit is fed by classical Ethernet.</p>

<p>Next, there's the part where you should calculate how much gain you actually need. You'll often be able to find tables with minimum signal strength needed for various modulation types from WiFi equipment manufacturers in tables such as one on <a href=""http://www.tp-link.us/products/details/cat-37_TL-WA7510N.html#specifications"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> page. 
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4uJp0.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4uJp0.png"" alt=""Speed rates""></a></p>

<p>You should use that information to give yourself a base-line of how much power you need at the receiver.  </p>

<p>Next step is to take the antenna gain in dBi and subtract the cable loss in dB from it and then repeat the calculation for the receiver. This will give you a sort of let me call it ""effective"" antenna gain, that you can later on use for different types of calculators. Cable loss is calculated by getting the manufacturer's specification that will list it usually in loss per meter, per foot or per 100 feet/30 meters or per 100 meters and then add the loss of the connectors, if you want to be really picky.</p>

<p>After that, you can go to a Friis calculator such as <a href=""https://www.pasternack.com/t-calculator-friis.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> one and use it to calculate the path loss for your distance and put the info from your equipment such as the gains you calculated previously and the transmitter power. The output will be received power, which needs to be higher than the minimum power needed for the speed you want to use, plus some more decibels  for extra safety margin, just in case of bad weather or similar. If the numbers don't fit, you can try to do trade-offs. You could switch to a higher-gain antenna, but that would be more expensive, you could move to a lower-loss cable, you could try to use a higher-power transmitter, but that can very easily be illegal if you break the local rules and so on. </p>

<p>Finally, there's the part where you should decide which band you want to use. If you want to use regular WiFi bands (meaning cheap equipment), you should do a ""site survey"" of some sort. Basically, you need to see which channels are free in the area. In general, 2.4 GHz is the band with larger antennas, cheaper APs and is more crowded. The path loss is lower in this band.<br>
In 5 GHz band, the antennas are smaller, there are more channels and usually much less users (this is VERY important for a good-working link). Also the newest IEEE 802.11 ac standard only works in this band. You'll also have more space for use of wider bandwidth transmissions. The path loss here is usually higher, so you can expect your signal to be around 6-7 dB weaker than in 2.4 GHz band. Equipment is also somewhat more expensive. </p>

<p>With latest AC equipment, you can expect a bit less than 1 gigabit per second speeds with a good WiFi installation, but that can somewhat deteriorate with weather.</p>

<p>Finally, let me remind you to check local regulations on WiFi equipment. In some cases, you might have restrictions on antenna types, antenna gains, EIRP, outdoor installations, so that even though WiFi is in general considered license-free, the your specific application might need registration or license or might be (in the worst case) simply illegal.</p>

<li>It has no feeder? There is a small box that I was unable to figure out what exactly was, but definitely it was not a usual feeder.</li>
<li>Cables obstructing the aperture? Just take a close look and you will see how there are lines between the antenna focal point and the branch ends. (Although they could be non-conductive material, I was not able to distinguish them from that distance).</li>

"Secure communication over Amateur-band HSMM / 802.11 in the United States","295","","<p>I'm quite interested in 802.11 over amateur radio frequencies; however, all I have done at this point is reading (I don't have a ham license yet).  The <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/questions/72/encrypted-traffic-and-amateur-radio/112"">conventional wisdom (espoused in this ham.SE answer) is that you cannot encrypt radio communications at all</a>.  This limitation seems to fly in the face of normal countermeasures used to secure data transfers through the internet.</p>

<p>So encryption is off the table; however, that still leaves issues such as authentication and data integrity.  I have read that <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRAM-MD5"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CRAM-MD5</a> hashes are sometimes used as part of data services implemented over 802.11 ham radio, because <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRAM-MD5"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CRAM-MD5</a> hashes are allowed under the FCC rules.  The contents of messages signed with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRAM-MD5"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CRAM-MD5</a> are always visible; yet, the authorship of the message can be verified (because <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRAM-MD5"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CRAM-MD5</a> works in the same way that PGP does).  As best I can tell, using <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRAM-MD5"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CRAM-MD5</a> leaves you vulnerable because:</p>

<ul>
<li>It does not perform mutual authentication (i.e. the client can't verify the server's identity)</li>
<li>It's possible to run off-line dictionary attacks against captured hashes (although the underlying <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC-MD5"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">HMAC-MD5</a> hash doesn't have the same vulnerabilities as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MD5</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>The bigger concern to me is a man in the middle attack, since <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRAM-MD5"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CRAM-MD5</a> offers no mutual authentication between client and server.  This kind of vulnerability is also the kind of dynamic that makes <a href=""http://blog.depthsecurity.com/2010/11/when-8021xpeapeap-ttls-is-worse-than-no.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PEAP worse than no 802.11 authentication</a> (since PEAP doesn't enforce mutual authentication between the wifi client and RADIUS server, like EAP-TLS does).  It has been shown that weak PEAP clients freely offer their password hashes to a wifi AP masquerading the same SSID as the real AP.  My concern with 802.11 over ham frequencies is determining that I'm giving my password / data to the right endpoint on the other side (and not an attacker).</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<ul>
<li>Is there another authentication scheme besides <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRAM-MD5"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CRAM-MD5</a>, that is both legal in the US and performs mutual authentication?</li>

</ul>
","<p>I'd say your best bet is to avoid handing over your hashed password entirely. Instead, use a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">zero-knowledge authentication</a> scheme; see <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/4991/zero-knowledge-proof-and-its-protocol/9185/"">this security.SE question for more details</a>. Zero Knowledge Authentication will make it so that it doesn't matter who you ""give"" your response to - even if a malicious server requests authentication (or intercepts other authentication), it doesn't actually learn anything about your password.</p>

<p>If you incorporate the response to the zero-knowledge auth as part of the public-key signed request, you should be able to formulate a system that both (a) is signed by the client, and (b) does not reveal information to 3rd parties that would allow them to forge future requests, since the zero-knowledge challenge response would form a nonce.</p>

<p>As far as verifying the server goes, a public key signature should suffice.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>(Previous response, before OP clarified...)</em></p>

<p>IANAL, but...</p>

<p>There is a difference between <em>encryption</em> and <em>authentication</em>. The former requires no one to be able to tell what data is being passed; the latter requires no one to be able to produce something that is accepted as legitimate without some (non-public) knowledge.</p>

<p>For instance, public-key based signatures allow for authentication of a message's sender without obscuring the contents of the message.</p>

<p>As long as you're okay with the content of your requests being <em>visible</em> but not <em>forgeable</em>, you could probably use such a public key system without running afoul of the FCC regs.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, you don't want anyone to be able to see what's in your requests and responses, you're out of luck.</p>

<p>Again, IANAL.</p>

"What's this ""crossover"" toroid winding called and what is its purpose?","291","","<p>I am winding an EFHW matchbox and many of the designs I've found (including the diagram provided with the kit I bought) include a sort of ""twist"" when winding them:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uFL5R.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uFL5R.jpg"" alt=""EFHW toroid example""></a></p>

<p>My understanding is that the section where the two green turns go with the initial red turns is called a ""bifilar"" winding and some recommend twisting the two wires together for that part — its own topic that I can research a bit more on my own.</p>

<p>But what is the trick where the red winding crosses across the middle and then continues winding? Does it have a name? Does it count as a turn — or a ""negative turn""? (In the diagram I have linked there are drawn 8+7 turns labeled as 2x7…but I suspect this is just a mistake.)</p>

<p>Why would the toroids be wound this way in two groups instead of just a simple total number of windings spread evenly around? When is this technique useful?</p>
","<p>This is a magnetic flux transformer, not a transmission line transformer. It works by flux coupling just like a mains power transformer. So the bifilar part isn't too special, nothing like a transmission line transformer.</p>

<p>In a regular flux transformer, the position of the winding doesn't really matter, only the number of turns. At RF though there is the concern about capacitance.</p>

<p>First concern is the inter-turn capacitance, which might make the coil resonant and stop working as a transformer. The best you can do is keep the number of turns small, and spread them out evenly. Of course fewer turns means more flux, so there's a trade-off.</p>

<p>The second concern is about the capacitance from one end of the winding to the other. A 64:1 transformer will have a very high impedance at the high voltage end, and any capacitance to the ground end of the winding will tend to load the high impedance end. This transformer might transform to an impractical 3200 ohms, but quite likely the capacitance from live to ground will be less than that.</p>

<p>So if you follow the wire, the reverse winding only reverses direction on the core, it keeps going the same way through and out, so it keeps developing more voltage at each turn. The reverse winding is a neat trick to keep the windings spread out, keep them going in the same direction, and keep the high voltage, high impedance end of the transformer far away from the ground.</p>

<p>I don't know it's name, but I'm sure it will have one.</p>

","<p>I don't think anyone would be transmitting AM for weak signal work unless they were just fooling around.  You'd get the same effect by cutting your power by 3/4s.

","<p>No, that's not possible.  There is no practical way to determine whether the transmitted power is usefully received by an antenna, or just absorbed by the ground.</p>

<p>It is possible to detect that a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superheterodyne_receiver"">superheterodyne receiver</a> with a known intermediate frequency is powered on and tuned to a particular frequency, because the receiver's local oscillator radiates a small signal.

But scanning for tiny local oscillator signals can only be done in a small local area, because the background of RF noise would swamp any attempts at large-scale detection.  Besides, radio design has evolved and receivers use many different architectures now, so superheterodyne receivers with the same IF are no longer universal.</p>

","<p>My non-technical over-simplified answer; <strong>yes, the type of metal used for an antenna will present different characteristics</strong>. The most obvious is the conductivity. Greater conductivity will yield higher radiation patterns, however, the size and dimension of the conductor also affects its performance. Cost, weight, and ease of manipulation of the material is often MORE of an issue than a slight percentage of increased performance due to the metal type. </p>

<p>Aluminum for example, is a prime choice for beams as it is easy to cut and bend, provides great conductivity, and is lightweight. A copper beam would provide greater conductivity, but as a soft metal it would bend out of shape easily and become unusable. Likewise, a dipole is usually copper wire as its flexibility provides better ease of mounting and wind resistance, and low cost for a long wavelength antenna.</p>

"What is the output impedance of a typical solid state ham transmitter?","284","","<p>I've often heard that the output impedance is 50Ω, and the load impedance should be matched to that and also 50Ω.

If it isn't 50Ω, what is it?</p>

","<p>Inside the output of a transmitter is often a PA, consisting of a transistor and a matching network. The output impedance of the transistor is easy to define during small-signal operation. From the datasheet of an MRF1535N, s22 translates to roughly 2.5-j2ohms at 100MHz. For simplicity, I'm assuming the device is unilateral, which it is not. For max gain, 50ohm would be matched to the conjugate, or 2.5+j2. The result is a transmitter with a 50ohm output impedance.</p>

<p>The output power and efficiency of a transistor can be optimized by maximizing the current and voltage swing at it's output. The limiting factors would be Imax and Vmax (Vbreakdown or 2*Vsupply). Loading the transistor with a resistance equal to Vmax/Imax results in a loadline capable of producing high power and efficiency. </p>

<p>The MRF1535N datasheet suggests a load of 1.7-j0.2, for good PA operation. 50ohm could be matched to 1.7ohm using a quarterwave line with Zo of roughly 9ohms. The result would be a transmitter with good power and efficiency into a 50ohm load. The small-signal output impedance would be 32ohm. </p>

<p>This is the difference between a gain (conjugate) match and a power (loadline, load-pull) match.</p>

<p>None of this directly answers the question, ""what is the output impedance of a transmitter"", because there's no simple answer. The transistor is typically operating nonlinearly, which can be modeled as a current source with a shunt RC that changes with voltage. This leads to the output impedance depending on the exact state of the PA and the exact state of the PA depending on the load. </p>

<p>Experts don't even agree regarding output impedance. Here's one view...
""once a device starts to operate in any significantly nonlinear fashion,..., the whole concept of output impedance starts to breakdown, due to the fact the waveforms are no longer sinusoidal"".</p>

  <p>grounding an antenna mast/tower (outside, lightning prevention)</p>

<p>A tower or mast must be grounded to ""earth"", usually through an 8' conductive (copper) rod driven into the ground as close to the antenna setup as humanly possible. Should the worst happen and lightning strike on or about the mast/tower, you offer the electricity a shorter path to ""earth"" and reduce the possibility of it entering the shack through your feed line.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>grounding transceiver/equipment (inside shack, RF leakage prevention)</p>

<p>Radio equipment may leak RF or high currents. Grounding the case (usually with a ground screw conveniently provided thereupon) will reduce the risk of operator injury and equipment damage.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>antenna ground plane (on/under antenna)</p>

<p>The antenna system requires a ""ground plane"" for the radio wave to form. With dipoles, one half of the antenna is your ground. In verticals, something below must provide ground to complete the RF wave.

The presence of a metal mast/tower (which is lightning grounded) may contribute/interfere with the ground plane but it is not considered the antenna ground.</p>

<p>It seems that the increasing adoption of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_radio"">SDR</a> and the continued interest in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QRP_operation"">QRP</a> would lead some down this path, but I haven't found any information about it in the Amateur community.</p>
","<p>There are a few radios that support diversity reception, but only to minimize effects of propagation rotation and multipath, not to increase data rates. This isn't true MIMO. It's more like SISO where the input is whichever one of two antennas has the strongest signal. </p>

<p>Which brings up another point - data. There really isn't that much data being used on ham radio at the moment. D-STAR is around, then Yaesu came out with a digital radio, and a lot of work is being done on things like Codec2 and FreeDV, but in general, it's not all that prolific. </p>

<p>However, MIMO in ham radio will still be reserved to things like HSMM and HamWan that actually have very large bandwidths. With that, the equipment is off-the-shelf. Some of it has MIMO capability, like 802.11N routers modified for use on amateur frequencies - just like you mentioned in your post. </p>

<p>It would be cool to have MIMO on lower bitrate and digital voice, but I don't think the gains would be that great.  </p>

<p>I do undergrad research in statistical channel precoding using SDR MIMO transceivers on amateur bands, and man, is it cool...but people don't have $40,000 to spend on a MIMO IQ vector generator/demodulator. I have yet to see a QRP MIMO homebrew rig, but that would be great! </p>

<p>Assuming that everything about these two antennas are identical aside from the number of bays, what exactly does ""adding more bays"" do for a bowtie antenna?</p>
","<p>It increases the directionality and gain of the antenna. This helps it reject noise coming from directions other than towards the transmitter. The higher signal to noise ratio leads to better reception.</p>

<p>For this antenna as drawn, the directions of maximum gain are two: one coming out of the page, and one in the opposite direction. Sometimes these antennas will have a reflector behind them to reduce that to just one direction.</p>

<p>For a wave arriving from the maximum gain direction, the wavefront hits all the bowties at the same time. The individual signals received from each bowtie then add constructively.</p>

<p>It's not immediately obvious why there's the crossover in the antenna. That is, why not are all the blue halves on one side, and the reds on the other? The reason is the two outer bowties are farther away from the feedpoint than the inner bowties. If the incoming wave hits all the bowties at the same time, but then the bowties are at different lengths from the feedpoint, by the time the signals have traveled from the bowtie to the feedpoint they will no longer be in phase, and no longer add constructively.</p>

<p>The crossover compensates for this delay. The wave is oscillating with some period; if we wait half this period the polarity at that instant will be reversed. The crossover accomplishes the same thing, not by waiting but by crossing the wires. Meanwhile, the extra distance that must be travelled from the farther bowties introduces another half-period of delay. That half-period, plus the additional half-period of the crossover, means that we are effectively delaying the signal by a full period, which is the same as not delaying it at all.</p>

"Is there a convention for SSB frequency selection?","280","","<p>I know that the amateur bands are not channelized. I know that anyone can pick an arbitrary frequency and they're not wrong, and you are not obligated to have a calibrated VFO. But if everyone picks frequencies at random during a period of heavy usage, there's likely to be inefficient allocation due to not-quite-wide-enough gaps to fit in.</p>

<p>Do there exist, then, any <strong>conventions for what frequencies to use, that are more widespread than each individual operator's idea for best practice?</strong></p>

<p>Thinking about this once, I said to myself: SSB is 3 kHz wide, so we can divide that neatly into XXX0000, XXX3000, XXX6000 Hz with only a little bit of waste.</p>

<p>More recently while I was operating on Field Day this year, I noticed a lot of people using XXXX500 Hz frequencies, and it occurred to me that if we consider the bandwidth as 2.4 or 2.5 kHz (as it apparently typically is as <em>transmitted</em>, even if receive filters aren't that sharp) then four channels fit into 10 kHz that way. Is that something people try do? (Reviewing my logs, some but not all of the 500 Hz frequencies fit this pattern.)</p>

<p>But trying to spot the pattern this way is an exercise in numerology. Are there any <strong>deliberately promoted, or somewhat accepted, schemes</strong> for SSB frequency selection?</p>
","<p>I am not sure I understand the question but I will attempt to answer a part of what you are asking.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thinking about this once, I said to myself: SSB is 3 kHz wide, so we can divide that neatly into XXX0000, XXX3000, XXX6000 Hz with only a little bit of waste.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No one does that.   When you choose a particular frequency for SSB, you usually will look for empty space and that means probably at least 3 KHz distant from other signals.  But, not always.  As previously stated, if the band is crowded, such as during contests, this 3 KHz rule goes out the window.  On modern radios today, many SSB operations will work with filters narrowing down their operating window to maybe 2 KHz.  I sometimes have operated at 1.8 KHz since I have a 1.8 KHz roofing filter on my Elecraft K3.  Yes, you can understand SSB at 1.8 KHz and it is not quality but who cares for SSB work especially in a contest.</p>

<p>Often I will arrange schedules with some buddies for late night 80 meter SSB chats.  For some unusual reason, we have a habit of picking 3767 KHz or something like that.  I like the odd numbers because it allows some kind of distance from a lot of regularly scheduled things that have a tendency to chew up the 1 KHz 0 digit (e.g. 3760, 3770, 3780,...).  And, if not the 0 mark, they go for the 5 KHz intervals (e.g. 3760, 3765, 3770, 3775,...).  So, regularly scheduled nets that can crowd the 80 meter band usually end up on the 0 and 5 1 KHz digit place so I avoid those for my schedules which are not regular.</p>

<p>And, when you make a schedule, you always inform the other party (parties) that if not found on such-and-such frequency, scan up 5 to 10 KHz and down 5 to 10 KHz looking.  </p>

<p>But, no one that I know of has ever planned or thought of channelizing the bands into 3 KHz chunks.  No one would obey that rule anyway so it is probably a waste of time.</p>

<p>On CW though or other digital modes, anything goes because the average signal width is much less than 1 KHz.</p>

<p>In my experience, on the 80 meter band, in the evening hours, no matter where you pick your frequency you are probably stepping on someones skirt or right on top of them.  You raise QRL? to find if anyone is there but their answer may not be heard by you even though you may be heard by them so you may likely stomp on them anyway.  This is especially true in the range 3900 to 3990 KHz.</p>

"Mic ground vs ground","280","","<p>Why do most radios have a microphone ground as well as a Ground?</p>

<p>I have found that simply using one ground and tying the microphone as well as the PTT (and audio out, 5v out or whatever else is in the I/O) to work just fine.   </p>
","<p>The problem you could run into is RF feedback into the sensitive mic input. This is particularly a problem if you run ""QRO"" - high power.  It is best to use shielded multi-conductor cable, with the shield being used as the return for the PTT control.  The mic output (signal and ground) are separately carried to the mic input connector, where the mic ""ground"" may actually terminate at the (sensitive) mic amplifier internally.  </p>

<p>This way, any RF currents (or possible 60 Hz AC pickup) are carried by the shield ground, which is generally terminated directly at the case of your radio, and they are kept away from the low-level audio amplifiers.</p>

"What happens to the ""Yo-Yo Tenna"" when you coil up its ends for use on higher frequencies?","280","","<p>I have gathered what is basically a <a href=""http://www.hamradiofun.com/yoyodeluxe.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Yo-Yo Tenna</a> using some Camco laundry reels and a spool of cheap speaker wire split in half (pretty much exact duplicate of <a href=""https://www.ar15.com/archive/topic.html?b=10&amp;f=22&amp;t=675149"" rel=""nofollow"">this build</a> as it turns out). I've got a bit of equipment to measure the amount of noise the antenna absorbs to help tune it up, but I'm wondering more from a theoretical/antenna-design standpoint: what happens RF-wise as I roll the reels up?</p>

<p>That is, the idea of these antennas is simply a ""wind up"" dipole: two lengths of wire that can each be coiled up. Not only does this make the antenna nicely portable, but as the description of the <a href=""http://www.hamradiofun.com/yo-yo-vee.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">Yo-Yo Vee</a> claims:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Simply adjust bands or SWR by winding/unwinding the reels!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've seen this to be true with my own setup too, I can unwind way less than the 100ft of each leg and get a higher frequency resonance. But what happens with the wound ends of the wire? Won't they form something of an inductor hanging out at each end? How would that inductance be expected to affect the efficiency and radiation pattern of the resulting antenna?</p>
","<p>I'm not certain of this answer, but this is my approximate understanding:</p>

<p>Yes, the coiled-up ends form inductors at the ends of the antenna. But the ends of the antenna are the part of it where (almost) no current flows, only voltage builds up! Therefore no current flows through the inductor, and so the inductance has no effect.</p>

<p>And if you're wondering why the extra length of wire doesn't still result in a “long” antenna due to the propagation time through it — well, the <em>mutual inductance between the turns of the coil</em> acts to couple the signal into all turns simultaneously, rather than it passing through the full length of the wire, so the signal enters the coil and immediately has effectively hit the end of the wire.</p>

<p>(But I think those are just two descriptions of the same thing, not two separate issues.)</p>

"Why must twin-lead conductor spacing be small to avoid radiation?","280","","<p>A transmission line does not radiate when the spacing between the two wires is very small when compared to the wavelength, but the transmission line begins to radiate when the spacing between the lines becomes comparable to the wavelength of the signal. Why is this?</p>
","<p>Twin-lead transmission lines don't radiate because the opposite fields from each conductor cancel, but when the spacing is far apart this does not happen.</p>

<p>First, let's consider the magnetic field around an infinite, straight conductor with uniform current throughout. In this image, the conductor is just right of center, and the current is coming straight out of the page.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JqjTi.png"" alt=""field from one conductor with uniform current""></p>

<p>Now let's add next to it another conductor, with the current going the other way:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QYGAJ.png"" alt=""fields from two conductors with opposite uniform current""></p>

<p>Add these fields together, and you get:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GG5Kb.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>For distances far away relative to the conductor spacing, the fields are equal but opposite, so when added together they cancel. Radiation is, by definition, a field that extends to infinity. If there are no fields far away, then it can't be radiating.</p>

<p>However, we made an assumption of <em>uniform</em> current. When the spacing between the conductors is small, this is a mostly true assumption. Although the current isn't exactly uniform, we must travel many multiples of the conductor spacing before there's any appreciable change in phase.</p>

<p>However, when the conductor spacing is large, then this is no longer true. Remember, the current is reversing direction periodically, and if we look at the field from just one conductor this means the field is alternating between clockwise and counterclockwise swirl. The changes to this field only propagate at the speed of light, so if we zoom the graph out to be a wavelength wide or more, we'd see those changes propagating away as waves.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/k7Ut8.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>In the image above, the wavelength appears to be approximately four units. Now if we add that second conductor, two units away, we get this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lSykz.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Notice how the fields don't cancel. They don't cancel because on the scale of the conductor spacing (which is not small relative to the wavelength) there can be significant changes in phase. Thus, there are regions of constructive interference where the fields don't cancel. These regions extend out to infinity, and thus, the feedline radiates.</p>

"With solid-state equipment, when would one use a dummy load?","280","","<p>With vacuum-tube-based transmitters, you'd need to tune the output finals to achieve maximum power output, and this was commonly done into some sort of dummy load (either a purpose-made dummy load or something simple like a light bulb) while aiming for maximum power output on or near the desired operating frequency.</p>

"Field Strength calculations with known antennas","277","","<p>I can receive a calibrated decibel milliwatt signal level from the output of any antenna at a given frequency. </p>

<p>With a given antenna gain (dbi) in the direction I want to receive the signal (including a 1/4 wave vertical or a loopstick antenna etc...), how can I calculate the field strength in µV / meter? </p>
","<p>Given:</p>

<ul>
<li>the receiving antenna's gain in dBi, $G_\mathrm{dBi}$</li>
<li>the power received by the antenna in dBm, $P_\mathrm{dBm}$</li>
<li>the frequency in Hz, $f$</li>
<li>the impedance of free space in ohms, $Z_0$</li>
<li>the speed of light in meters per second, $c$</li>
</ul>

<p>then the field strength in V/m is:</p>

<p>$$ \begin{align*}
V &amp;=
\:\sqrt{ 0.004\, \pi\, Z_0 }
\:f/c
\:10^{(P_\mathrm{dBm}-G_\mathrm{dBi}) / 20}
\\
&amp;\approx 7.258\times 10^{-9}\: f
\:10^{(P_\mathrm{dBm}-G_\mathrm{dBi}) / 20}
\end{align*}$$</p>

<p>If the frequency is in MHz and the result is in µV/m then the constant becomes more manageable:</p>

<p>$$ V_\mathrm{\mu V/m}
\approx 7258
\: f_\mathrm{MHz}
\: 10^{(P_\mathrm{dBm}-G_\mathrm{dBi}) / 20}
$$</p>

<p>Note that the receiving antenna must match the polarization of the voltage field being measured. In situations where the polarization isn't known, an isotropic receiver can be used, which is usually an orthogonal arrangement of short dipoles in 3 axes. Such an antenna can measure a voltage gradient in any direction.</p>

<hr>

<p>I find it's easier to understand why this is true by thinking about power density rather than field strength.</p>

<p>If you have a 1 watt isotropic antenna at the center of a sphere, the entire 1 watt of that transmitted power must pass through the sphere. The power density is then the transmitted power, divided by the surface area of the sphere. The result is a number in units of watts per square meter.</p>

<p>The receiving antenna, assuming it is identically polarized, is then a ""net"" for this energy flux. The size of the net is the antenna aperture, which can be calculated from its gain.</p>

<p>$$ A = {\lambda^2 \over 4 \pi} 10^{G_\text{dBi}/10} $$</p>

<p>For more detail, see <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/questions/1539/what-does-the-friis-transmission-equation-represent-and-how-is-it-derived"">What does the Friis transmission equation represent and how is it derived?</a></p>

<p>In the far field, power density and the field strength are related by the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impedance_of_free_space"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">free space impedance</a>, which is approximately 377Ω. Converting between power density and field strength is very much like Ohm's law. This can be derived from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poynting%27s_theorem"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Poynting's theorem</a>:</p>

<p>$$ \text{power density} = {\text{field strength}^2 \over \text{free space impedance}} $$</p>

<p>Or solved for field strength:</p>

<p>$$ \text{field strength} = \sqrt{\text{power density} \times \text{free space impedance}}  $$</p>

<p>Thus, if you can measure the power density at some point, say by measuring the feedpoint power from an antenna of known gain, then you can calculate the field strength.</p>

<p>For example, say the antenna has a gain of 3 dBi at a wavelength of 2 meters, and you measure a power at the feedpoint of 0.1μW.</p>

<p>The aperture is:</p>

<p>$$ {(2\:\mathrm{m})^2 \over 4 \pi} 10^{3\:\mathrm{dBi}/10} = 0.635\:\mathrm{m}^2 $$</p>

<p>The power density is then:</p>

<p>$$ {0.1\:\mathrm{\mu W} \over 0.635\:\mathrm{m}^2} = 0.157\:\mathrm{\mu W}/\mathrm{m}^2 $$</p>

<p>And the corresponding field strength:</p>

<p>$$ \sqrt{0.157\:\mathrm{\mu W/m^2} \times 377\:\Omega} = 7705\:\mathrm{\mu V/m}$$</p>

"What are the dos and don'ts when it comes to retractable antennae for HTs?","277","","<p>I was thinking of getting a retractable antenna for my Baofeng UV-82 8W HT. I found a <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00SCI0BRO"" rel=""nofollow"">Nagoya NA771R</a>. </p>

<ol>
<li>What are the dos and don'ts for using such a retractable antenna with a HT? </li>
<li>Should it always be fully extended while Rx and Tx?</li>
<li>Will it offer additional benefit over the default rubber ducky?</li>
</ol>

<p>I have had '59' rated QSOs on VHF bands using the rubber ducky with stations about 20-30kms away w/o repeaters. </p>
","<p>The biggest <strong>do</strong> is to <strong>follow the manufacturer's instructions.</strong></p>

<p>I can't immediately locate any sort of instruction sheet for this particular antenna, but given that using it is <em>slightly</em> more involved than just connecting it to your radio's antenna connector, something like that should be included with it. (You could also just contact your local Nagoya reseller and ask.)</p>

<p>With collapsible antennas, you need to take care to not break it; the joints between sections present a breakage risk that is not present in antennas that have a fixed physical length. Fixed length antennas can be made as basically a flexible piece of wire; retractable antennas need to be much more rigid to support their own weight, particularly in odd orientations which are common with HT operating. <strong>In many cases</strong> this can make a full-length, fixed-length flexible antenna a better choice than a collapsible, rigid antenna because the former is better able to handle the moderate abuse portable antennas often are put through.</p>

<p>In general:</p>

<ul>
<li>""More antenna"" (fully extended) is rarely a problem <em>when receiving</em>. The sweet spot for feedpoint impedance is an odd number of quarter wave lengths (1/4, 3/4, 5/4, ...) assuming a reasonable ground plane; the physical length that this corresponds to depends on the specific construction of the antenna.</li>
<li>""Less antenna"" (collapsed) <em>should not</em> be a significant problem <em>when receiving</em>. At worst, the received signal strength will be reduced vis-a-vis a larger antenna.</li>
<li>Antenna length is much more critical <em>when transmitting</em> because the impedance matching becomes more important.</li>
</ul>

<p>It doesn't really matter very much if the antenna/radio impedance mismatch causes 99% of the signal received by the antenna to be reflected back into the antenna rather than being transferred to the radio (your received signal strength would be 20 dB down, which isn't great but probably not that much worse than most rubber duck antennas), but it matters a whole lot if 99% of the signal transmitted by the radio is reflected back into the radio (that's 4.95 W out of 5 W, going in a direction it doesn't belong)!</p>

<ul>
<li>Shortened antennas are always a compromise. 1/4 wavelength with a good ground plane is almost always the best you can strive for mounted on a HT. However, if a shortened antenna gives good enough results for you (as in, you are able to hear everyone you want to hear, and can raise everyone you need to and/or hear), then you won't magically be getting <em>more use</em> out of your radio when getting a better antenna. In really extreme situations, it could raise your noise floor, making picking out stations <em>more</em> difficult.</li>
</ul>

<p>A more efficient antenna may allow you to operate using a lower power output setting (as in, you might be able to work the same stations with good results on 500 mW as with 5 W into the rubber duck antenna), which will help conserve some battery power. However, due to the transmission duty cycle commonly being very low in amateur radio, this isn't going to make a very big difference; I would expect a few percent longer operating time out of being able to reduce transmitter power by 10 dB, at best. In other words, this should not be your deciding factor.</p>

"Why do SDR control apps have two frequency settings?","274","","<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FYsbR.png"" alt=""""></p>

<p>Why do many SDR control apps have two frequency settings, even when the app is designed or set up only for listening to or decoding one signal?  Should the two SDR frequency controls be set differently or the same?  If different, how much for which modulation schemes (CW, USB, LSB, AM, etc.), in which direction, and why?</p>
","<p>One controls the hardware, and the other controls the software.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The <em>hardware</em> selects some section of the entire RF spectrum (by a local oscillator and mixer), and down-converts it into a frequency an analog-to-digital converter can handle, filters it (to discard out-of-band signals), samples it, and delivers that data to the computer.</p>

<p>This data determines what you can <em>see</em> in the so-called “waterfall” or “panadapter” displays. It also sets the limit for the widest-bandwidth signal you can possibly demodulate.</p></li>
<li><p>Then the <em>software</em> does a similar process in order to select a <em>single signal</em> to demodulate; it shifts it to baseband (a “0 Hz” signal which only varies according to the modulation), applies a low-pass filter, and demodulates appropriately.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Both stages have their own controllable local oscillator, and those two controls are what you are seeing.</p>

<p>Here are some reasons for there to be these two separate stages:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Analog hardware is imperfect; there are various sorts of garbage you can get in the digital signal (DC offset, IQ imbalance, insufficiently filtered out-of-band signals). You can change the hardware center frequency to shift the garbage <em>away</em> from the signal of interest.</p>

<p>For example, if there is a DC offset (RTL-SDRs with E4000 tuners do) then you have garbage at the center frequency, so you would set it to be slightly different from the signal of interest so that the following digital filter removes that part. <strong>This is one of the main reasons to specifically set the two frequencies differently,</strong> if your receiver has this problem. It doesn't matter which direction you offset, as long as the offset is enough that the bandwidth of the desired signal doesn't overlap the unwanted signal.</p>

<p>On the other hand, filtering is imperfect and the way this shows up in the signal from the hardware is that signals which are <em>out</em> of the tuned band, but strong, will be seen to “wrap around” and appear at an in-band frequency modulo the hardware bandwidth (sample rate). This is a reason to receive <em>close</em> to the center; the hardware filtering is at its best at that point.</p>

<p>I highly recommend playing with changing the (hardware) center frequency slowly and watching and listening to how the displayed signals change or don't. You will learn what to do.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are interested in monitoring a whole band rather than a single station (e.g. a single amateur HF band) then keeping the hardware settings fixed leaves your waterfall display undisturbed to watch activity over the whole band while you are free to select which stations you are currently demodulating (listening to).</p></li>
<li><p>Digital filters can be optimized for the particular mode in use, and, if you don't care about power consumption, be extremely sharp (good at selecting exactly what is wanted) compared to analog filters. They can also be adjusted in bandwidth or shape to trade off filtering out nearby unwanted signals vs. better intelligibility in the absence of nearby signals. (Note that this is a reason for the two-stage architecture, but it isn't directly a reason to have independent tuning controls as you've asked.)</p></li>

"Radio manufactured in United States","272","","<p>I am just beginning with amateur radio and would like to start with an entry level handheld transceiver.  I would like to consider manufacturers based in the United States, but I have not found any.  Are there any USA handheld ham radio manufacturers?</p>
","<p>Motorola is a US-based manufacturer that makes handheld VHF/UHF transceivers, but they are intended for business and/or government use.  Many models can be programmed for amateur frequencies though; programming usually requires a special cable, a computer, and programming software.  Compared to models aimed at the ham market the Motorola models lack many features, like the ability to scan band ranges, but if you just want to talk on a few repeaters, a Motorola HT capable of ""wide"" FM on the right band(s) should work fine.  They are quite a bit more expensive than the usual popular ham models, but on the other hand they are considered very rugged.  I looked around on eBay to see what was available, and the model I found had been made in Malaysia, but I would think that older and/or more expensive models were made in the US.  The future of business and government two-way communication is digital modes and/or ""narrow"" FM, so you would probably want an older model anyway.</p>

<p>If you are truly determined to get a US-made HT, your best option is probably to find someone in your local club who is a current or retired two-way radio dealer who knows Motorola models, can easily get the right model (which might be used), and can program it for you.  (We have such a ham in my local club.)  You might be able to do it on your own, but you'd have a steep learning curve.  Either way, be prepared to spend quite a bit more than you would for a typical Japanese-made or Chinese-made ham HT.</p>

"What is the actual loss in a feed line with high SWR?","272","","<p>It is well-known that it is unwise to have standing waves on the feed line between one's antenna and one's transmitter, unless it is a very low-loss type (e.g. ladder line), because the transmitted signal is reflected multiple times through the feed line, incurring repeated losses.</p>

<p><strong>How can I calculate the actual loss in dB, given that I know the SWR and the normal (with a matched source and load) loss of the feed line?</strong></p>

<p>(I have already found <a href=""https://www.dk0tu.de/users/DL5BBN/Cable_Losses_at_High_SWR/cableatten.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">an article</a> which claims to derive a formula for the loss in the obvious fashion of summing the series of reflections. But I find it not all that clearly written for purposes of making use of the answer, and I also think that it would be good to have this question answered here on Amateur Radio SE.)</p>
","<p>Assuming no tuner losses, feedline losses in decibels are:</p>

<p>$$ -10 \log \left(L {
  1 - |\Gamma|^2 \over
  1-L^2 \: |\Gamma|^2
}\right) $$</p>

<p>Where $L$ is the fraction of power transmitted by the feedline into a matched load:</p>

<p>$$ L := 10^{-\text{loss in decibels}/10} $$</p>

<p>and $\Gamma$ is the reflection coefficient:</p>

<p>$$ |\Gamma| := { \text{VSWR} -1 \over \text{VSWR} +1} $$</p>

<hr>

<p>Let's work an example and look at how it's derived.</p>

<p>Begin by calculating the loss of the feedline from the datasheet and the length. Let's say it's 0.46 dB per 100 feet, and 100 feet long, so feedline loss is 0.46 dB. Let's undecibel that and make it a ratio:</p>

<p>$$ L := 10^{-0.46/10} = 0.9 $$</p>

<p>Meaning, 90% of the power is transmitted, and the other 10% is absorbed by the feedline.</p>

<p>The math is easier if we express VSWR as a reflection coefficient $\Gamma$. It's a complex number but we don't care about the phase of the reflection (and we can't know it from just the VSWR anyway), so we'll calculate just the magnitude.</p>

<p>$$ |\Gamma| := { \text{VSWR} -1 \over \text{VSWR} +1} $$</p>

<p>Let's say for our example the VSWR is 2.35:1. That's a reflection coefficient of 0.4. This is a ratio of amplitude or voltage, so square it to obtain power: 16% of power is reflected, and the other 84% is accepted by the antenna.</p>

<p>And let's say forward power is 100 W. Now let's visualize what happens to that power as it reflects back and forth a few times.
<br><br></p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/b7OP4.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/b7OP4.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>Sum all the power that was accepted by the antenna (75.6W + 9.8W + 1.3W + 0.16W + ...) to explain how much of that 100W was accepted by the antenna, and the rest was lost to the feedline. Shown in the diagram, a total of 86.8W makes it to the antenna. That means losses were:</p>

<p>$$ 10 \log\left(86.8 \over 100 \right) = 0.61\:\mathrm{dB} $$</p>

<p>Through more iterations we can obtain a more precise answer, but you can see that after a few reflections the powers have become small enough to be negligible.</p>

<p>You might wonder why the transmitter reflects 100%. Well, where else would it go? There aren't usually any significant resistive components in the antenna tuner or transmitter since that would just waste transmitter power. The power has no place to go but back down the feedline. There are situations where this isn't true (tomnexus gives an example of a lab signal generator) but for a typical ham transmitter setup it holds.</p>

<p>Back to the math. Loss in decibels is calculated from the ratio of input power to output power, so let's calculate the fraction of input power that's accepted by the antenna.</p>

<p>Whatever the incident power at the antenna, $|\Gamma|^2$ of it is reflected, and $1-|\Gamma|^2$ of it is accepted. If we want to calculate the power accepted on a specific reflection, we need only find the incident power, and multiply it by $1-|\Gamma|^2$.</p>

<p>To calculate the incident power, we can count the number of trips though the feedline that have happened so far, and the number of times a reflection off the antenna has occurred so far. Each trip through the feedline reduces the power by a factor of $L$, and each reflection off the antenna by a factor of $|\Gamma|^2$.</p>

<p>For the first reflection, it's just one trip through the feedline and zero prior reflections.</p>

<p>$$ L^1 \cdot (|\Gamma|^2)^0 \cdot (1 - |\Gamma|^2) \\
\tag{accepted, 1st reflection}$$</p>

<p>On the second reflection, it's three trips through the feedline, and one prior reflection.</p>

<p>$$ L^3 \cdot (|\Gamma|^2)^1 \cdot (1 - |\Gamma|^2) \\
\tag{accepted, 2nd reflection}$$</p>

<p>On the third reflection, it's five trips through the feedline, and two prior reflections.</p>

<p>$$ L^5 \cdot (|\Gamma|^2)^2 \cdot (1 - |\Gamma|^2) \\
\tag{accepted, 3rd reflection}$$</p>

<p>A pattern emerges: the power accepted at each reflection is the same at the previous reflection, multiplied by</p>

<p>$$ L^2 \: |\Gamma|^2 $$</p>

<p>These summed together is the total power accepted:</p>

<p>$$ \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} L(1 - |\Gamma|^2) (L^2 \: |\Gamma|^2)^n
$$</p>

<p>This is a geometric series, and can be simplified to</p>

<p>$$ \lim_{n \to \infty}
L(1 - |\Gamma|^2)
{
  1-(L^2 \: |\Gamma|^2)^n \over
  1-L^2 \: |\Gamma|^2
} $$</p>

<p>Because $L^2 \: |\Gamma|^2$ is less than 1, $(L^2 \: |\Gamma|^2)^n \to 0$ so the equation further simplifies to:</p>

<p>$$ L {
  1 - |\Gamma|^2 \over
  1-L^2 \: |\Gamma|^2
} $$</p>

"Why aren't there baluns that do BOTH balanced/unbalanced transformation and common mode current attenuation?","272","","<p>I have read myself blue, about baluns. Especially 1:1 ones.</p>

<p>Some claim they're only there to balance the unbalanced signal, and that's what's in the name also, but I find several that claims that the main thing at the point of a balun is common mode current attenuation.</p>

<p>And from where I stand I agree with both, because both are logical.</p>

<p>So, when I Google around for baluns I find recipes for ones that do one or the other, never any that do both. Why?</p>
","<p>There are. I suspect you're confusing a couple of different things when it comes to balance.</p>

<p>Common mode current is current which appears to flow on both conductors in the feed line with the same polarity and magnitude. If you put RF in to an ideal coax and from an ideal source, the current on the center conductor is precisely equal in magnitude and opposite in phase to the current flowing on the <em>inside</em> of the coax shield. No current should flow on the exterior of the coax shield at all, and the fields of the current on the two conductors on the inside of the coax cancel, resulting in zero radiation.</p>

<p>Any current that does flow on the exterior of the coax shield has no opposing current, as there's no closely coupled conductor for it to induce that opposite current on as there is for the center conductor and the inside of the shield. There is no counteracting field to cancel it, so it can radiate freely. In the case of a received signal and an ungrounded radio, you can imagine that this unopposed signal would cause the entire radio to ""float"" at the common mode voltage, essentially the signal would enter the receiver through the ground plane of the radio's circuits. This makes it very difficult to filter once it reaches the radio.</p>

<p>In the case of a transmitted signal, the exterior of the coax shield appears to be a radiating element or a ground radial, depending on the exact nature of the installation. This is most often the cause of ""RF in the shack"". The exterior of the coax is radiating in very close proximity to sensitive electronics.</p>

<p>Common mode on balanced line is just the same. It is some voltage that appears to travel on both conductors equally, not opposite in phase as it should be, and the same problems arise.</p>

<p>Common mode can arise either because of a difference in magnitude between the two conductors in a feed line, or difference in phase between the two. Let's consider an example:</p>

<p>If you have a symmetrical dipole with perfect balance, fed with ladder line, we know that the voltage on one feed line conductor will be precisely equal in magnitude and opposite in phase to the other. If we were to measure voltage on a single conductor relative to ground at an arbitrary instant in time and point on the ladder line and saw a potential of +100 volts, we would expect to check the spot on the other conductor at the same point in time and place on the ladder line and see -100 volts. Measured relative to each other, the voltage would be 200 volts peak to peak.</p>

<p>Now let's pass our ladder line by a big chunk of grounded metal, but let's say that one of the ladder line conductors was much closer to that metal than the other. More power would be coupled out of the conductor that came closer to the metal than the one that was further away. If we measured voltage at some point between the radio and that grounded metal, perhaps now we would see only +75 volts relative to ground on the one that came close to the metal, and still -100 volts on the conductor that was further away. We now have a common mode voltage of -25 volts between the conductors. The field of the wire with lower voltage doesn't have a strong enough field to cancel the entire field from the other conductor, so there is now ""excess"" field, the feed line can radiate, and if the radio is not well grounded, it will appear to float at -25 volts. This is how RF burns from microphones happen.</p>

<p>Ok, so now we've got a good picture of common mode and what it is. What do baluns do about it?</p>

<p>There are two basic forms of balun, and it is important not to confuse them: Chokes, and transformers.</p>

<p>Transformers are less common. They work through magnetic coupling and generally have <strong>isolated windings</strong>. This means there are separate primary and secondary windings, and no direct path for DC between the two. Any transfer of current between them is via coupling, usually through a core of some kind. Transformers are good for very high efficiency impedance transformation because the cores are very low loss at the frequency you're using, and they're usually designed to resonate at a given frequency. When the differential mode and common mode current meet in the primary, they are essentially added together, resulting in a wave that is once again ""clean"" and balanced, but with the magnitude of the wave altered by the constructive and destructive interference of the two signals being combined. This is what is meant when it is said that balance is ""forced"".</p>

<p>When properly designed and installed, <strong>they do provide common mode suppression</strong>, but at a price. They are generally narrow banded, working best on only a couple of bands. Outside of their resonant window, there is substantial reactance that will make them inefficient and cause SWR issues. They also tend to be more expensive, as the low loss core material is more expensive to make, and it must be physically large because it will carry 100% of the total current between the windings. </p>

<p>You can make them wide banded, but only by sacrificing the common mode suppression, as you won't have isolated windings. These are often called ""ununs"" though that's a terrible term IMO because it implies that it still does...something...with regards to choking or the like. They are, in fact, only impedance transformers (Put a good choke on your EARCHI at the feed point with no radials and it won't tune at all).</p>

<p>The second kind of balun, a choke, is much more common and provides both balance and excellent common mode attenuation over a wide frequency range. The trade off is efficiency.</p>

<p>Choke baluns work by inducing the current of both conductors on to a single core at the same time. We know that the current is equal and opposite ideally, so if they are wrapped around a toroid side by side, in the same direction, the field they induce on the toroid will also be equal and opposite. This means it will cancel and there will be no net magnetic field in the core. This means that if the system is perfectly balanced, zero current will flow in the toroid.</p>

<p>When the system is unbalanced, the field of one conductor ""wins"", and induces some current on the toroid. This current then has to travel through the toroid between the two conductors. If we use very lossy core material, this current will be turned to heat and disappear from the feed line. Since that induced field is equal to the difference in field strength between the two windings, the signal will once again be balanced when it leaves the balun, though at a loss equal to the ratio of common mode current to differntial mode.</p>

<p>The problem with chokes is that heat. If the system is badly unbalanced, considerable heat can be generated by the toroid, and because they aren't particularly efficient shapes or materials for radiating that heat, it can accumulate to a problematic level with only 15 or 20 watts of common mode loss in a large toroid. You can get around this by using several toroids and fewer turns around them, spreading the power dissipation between several toroids, but this gets big, heavy, and potentially pretty expensive.</p>

<p>By using a combination of series and parallel 1:1 chokes, you can accomplish impedance transformation efficiently (assuming reasonable balance in the first place). The fact that they are non-resonant and actually utilize loss rather than avoiding it to the greatest degree possible makes them very wide banded.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> There is no effective difference between attaining balance and eliminating common mode, but there are two different ways to accomplish balance that are easily described as ""transformers"" and ""chokes"".</p>

","<p>Terminology can be ambiguous here; there is no universal standard for how to describe antennas. That said, here are some heuristics:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If someone says, e.g., “a 20-meter dipole”, they mean an antenna which is <em>for the 20-meter band</em>, i.e. almost 10 meters long from end to end (because a full-size dipole has an electrical length of λ/2).</p></li>
<li><p>If someone says the <em>length</em> of a dipole antenna is some particular value, then they mean the length from one end to the other — the physical space taken up by the antenna — which will be λ/2.</p>

<p>In the US, if they specify a length in <em>feet</em>, then they're almost certainly referring to the physical length. I don't know if there are any clues like this in other countries.</p></li>
<li><p>As far as I know, no one ever uses the λ/4 value in discussing dipole antennas, unless they're giving instructions for cutting the wires to the proper length.</p></li>

"Do a toroid's specs matter much in an antenna matching transformer?","270","","<p>I'm getting started with my first (very basic) HF rig and for convenience and the experience I'd like to try an <a href=""http://www.aa5tb.com/efha.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">End Fed Half Wave</a> antenna. Typical designs for a ""matchbox"" in this case include somewhere between a 6:1 and 10:1 turns ratio around a toroid.</p>

<p>Winding my own toroids is a new experience (though I guess I've built electromagnets and germanium radios as a kit) and I'm still pretty unfamiliar with the conventions. I understand that ferrites come in a <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/questions/1159/how-does-one-read-a-ferrite-datasheet"">variety of specifications</a> beyond just size — permeability, flux density, etc. I need to learn more about these for winding <em>inductors</em> themselves, but how relevant are they for <em>transformers</em>?</p>

<p>For example, on the first link there's one short reference ""the torroid [sic] is actually larger than a T-50-2"". In <a href=""http://pages.suddenlink.net/wa5bdu/efhw.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this build</a> ""the toroid is a T130-2 core"". I really don't know what those numbers mean to begin with, but I get the impression I could wind the right number of turns around pretty much any size/shape ferrite and get something that would work? Would certain options be less efficient? Or simply effect the maximum working power? What factors should I pay attention to, and what can I ignore for these purposes?</p>
","<p>Transformers <em>are</em> inductors. They just happen to have mutual inductance with another inductor. Like inductors, they also have self-capacitance, and so a resonant frequency. They also have loss, and consequently some maximum power handling ability which if exceeded causes the transformer to fail by overheating.</p>

<p>As such, any parameter which is relevant to an inductor might also be relevant to a transformer. There is no general way to say what parameters are relevant or not: to answer that question requires some understanding of the circuit in question, and its operation and requirements.</p>

<p>For example, you'll need to consider the magnetizing inductance of the transformer. This is the inductance that the transmitter sees looking into the transformer as a result of the transformer itself. You can measure it by leaving the secondary disconnected and measuring the transformer as an inductor.</p>

<p>In your end-fed dipole example, this magnetizing inductance appears in parallel with the antenna. There are two ways to approach this problem.</p>

<p>One way is to make sure the magnetizing inductance is an impedance much greater than 50Ω (50Ω being, hopefully, the impedance of the antenna, as seen by the transmitter). This will mean that the magnetizing inductance has negligible effect on the overall impedance seen by the transmitter. (If that doesn't make sense, consider the impedance of a 1kΩ resistor: what happens if you add a 1MΩ resistor in parallel?)</p>

<p>If it's not practical to obtain a sufficiently high inductance, then a capacitor can be added in parallel with the transformer to make a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LC_circuit#Parallel_LC_circuit"" rel=""nofollow"">parallel LC circuit</a>, which at resonance has a very high impedance. The interwinding capacitance of the transformer also effectively contributes parallel capacitance, so it's possible to design a transformer which is self-resonant and does not require an additional capacitor.</p>

<p>Another way to deal with the magnetizing inductance is to incorporate it into the design of the circuit. If you needed an inductor anyway, perhaps as part of a filter or a matching network, then you can put the primary of an appropriately designed transformer there instead.</p>

<p>So what does this mean for your end-fed dipole example? What things might we change, and what effect would they have in that application?</p>

<p>We could increase the number of turns, while maintaining the same turns ratio. This will increase magnetizing inductance, which might be good since we want that impedance to be high. More turns will also increase the interwinding capacitance. But more turns will also increase the magnetic flux through the core, eventually hitting the limit of saturation.</p>

<p>We could use a different material. But we'd want to consider the losses inherent in that material, its permeability and the effect that will have on the magnetizing inductance, and its maximum flux density and how that will impact the peak current the transformer can handle.</p>

<p>The physical size of the core is also a concern. A larger core spreads the magnetic flux through it through more area, and so can handle more magnetic flux (and consequently, current and power) before reaching saturation. A larger core also has more area to lose heat from losses to its surroundings, and more thermal mass to absorb transient power peaks, and so can handle more power.</p>

","<p>I spent some more time modeling this antenna in <a href=""http://www.eznec.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">EZNEC+ 5.0.67</a>. The latest results are interesting. Below the text here are 5 images showing:</p>

</ol>

<p>Although I don't have the feedline and source placed where they really ought to be, I believe that the patterns, current distributions along the various elements, and gains (dBi) shown for each band are close enough.</p>

<p><strong>Note the low gain at low angles when the antenna is operated on 440 MHz</strong>. The maximum gain occurs at 43 degrees! That's just too high if you're trying to access a distant station or repeater under minimal path conditions. </p>

<p>The pattern and gain on 2 meters is pretty good; however, a much smaller 2m antenna would do about as well.</p>

<p>As you'll notice, the distribution of the current lobes (shown in purple) along the elements do not seem quite right on either band. This is probably due to either:</p>

<ol>
<li>This model does not have the coax running from the feedpoint down through the middle of the lower section or</li>
<li>The dimensions of the antenna are not quite optimized.</li>
</ol>

<p>Also, if you run an auto SWR sweep in EZNEC, you'll find that the VSWR is rather high. Change the source and transmission line parameters, route the coax through a 'wire frame' representation of the lower pipe, and that ought to change.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.eznec.com/autoezlink.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">AC6LA's AutoEZ plugin</a> can --among other things-- optimize element lengths. However, whether it will work on this particular antenna design, I do not know <em>nor do I have the time to go much further than I have here</em>.</p>

In fact, with more complicated tuners that have more adjustments, this is usually the first step so that you can be in the right ballpark and avoid subjecting your transmitter to a really horrible match.</p>

<p>Your proposed method of coupling another transmitter to this particular tuner has a couple of problems, though. Firstly, this device doesn't really measure SWR, but instead is an impedance bridge which determines if the antenna impedance is 50 ohms. See the <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/a/2404/218"">explanation of how the circuit works</a> in another question, and it should be obvious how this won't work without the transmitter.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you put your calibrated transmitter ""very close"" to the antenna, then it will be coupling to the antenna in the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_and_far_field"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">near field</a>, which has significantly different characteristics than the far field, which is what you care about for radio communication.</p>

<p>Lastly, tuning is frequency dependent, so a 7.017MHz transmitter isn't of much help for tuning 14.034MHz. You could probably find a way to make your transmitter generate a 2nd harmonic and filter that out, and then you'd have 14.034MHz.</p>

<p>I have a much simpler idea: try increasing C1. If you increase it enough, it will be able to power D2 through the period between the dashes. You can also try increasing R4, which will make the LED less bright, but discharge C1 more slowly. To get an idea of the values you need, consider the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC_time_constant"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">time constant</a> of R4 and C1, which you want to be on the order of the spacing between the dashes, which is around 60ms for 20 WPM. So:</p>

<p>$$ 1\:\mathrm k \Omega \cdot C_1 = 60\:\mathrm{ms} \\
C_1 \approx 60 \:\mu \mathrm F $$</p>

<p>The disadvantage of this modification is that the LED indicator will be less responsive to your adjustments.</p>

","<p>I don't think there is a right answer here, but I will share mine and the one I suggest to new hams.  </p>

<p>The ARRL Handbook is an awesome reference, especially for the price.  You simply get a ton of information from basic electronics on through all the major areas of amateur radio.  With the numbering system they use, there isn't even a good way to determine the number of pages in any given edition.  I think it's safe to say that it's current page count is north of 1200 pages and has grown steadily over the years.</p>

<p>In fact it was the Handbook that was one of the big draws of amateur radio when I was first introduced to it as a teenager.  It was simply the best collection of cool electronic information I had ever seen in one place.</p>

<p>It's too large a product for it to change substantively from year to year; the ARRL just doesn't have the staff for that.  But I think it's aim, as a handbook/reference is more like an encyclopedia than a be-all reference.  And the basics don't change that much from year to year.  What does change are the projects that accompany the articles.  These tend to be reprints from QST or other ARRL publications, but none-the-less serve to make concrete examples of the theory presented there.</p>

<p>Technology changes and ham radio follows along (or leads!), so I think one every 5 years is probably fine.  I have the last 15 years on my shelf, except for the last two years.  That's because I don't buy them new.  As much as I like them, $50 a pop is just too big a chunk of my radio budget this year.</p>

<p>But, I probably only spent around US\$100 on the 13 volumes I have by buying them used on eBay and at hamfests.  For instance, the last copy of the 2010 Handbook that sold on eBay went for US\$5.00 and the one that's up right now is at US\$0.99 with no bidders.</p>

<p>I'll be doing my best to explain to him how this works. I understand that when a radio ray passes over an antenna, it generates an alternating electrical field in the antenna wire. If the antenna wire is the correct length for the given radio ray, the electrons in the wire will bounce back and forth in sync with the alternating field, moving faster and faster with each oscillation (resonance).

<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_radio#Design"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_radio#Design</a></p>

<p>I was able to find some helpful material on the howstuffworks pages for AM radios, but it is not a one-to-one mapping of the design proposed in the first diagram.</p>
","<p>I'll try to address your concerns a bit! I'll be simplifying here and there, but I think you'll notice where I'm doing that.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'll be doing my best to explain to him how this works. I understand that when a radio ray passes over an antenna, it generates an alternating electrical field in the antenna wire.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Close, but not quite :) I'll correct you here, because it makes things easier to explain below.</p>

<p>We talk of radio <em>waves</em>, not <em>rays</em>. The point is that the wave actually <em>is</em> the alternating electrical field <em>in the air</em>. It induces a <em>current</em> in the antenna. So, any piece of metal that you have lying around is an antenna, and there's electricity flowing through it, because there's radio waves of all kinds of sources (some natural, some man-made, some intentional, some accidental) everywhere! But: these antennas don't work overly well, and also, there's not much power at most wavelengths (see below).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the antenna wire is the correct length for the given radio ray, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here's why I mentioned the wave naming: If the wave's <em>wavelength</em> happens to be such that the antenna connects a ""deep"" and a ""high"" point in the electrical field, you get an especially strong current. So, the length of your antenna has to be in a specific relation to the wavelength of the radio signal you want to capture. If it's a bit ""off"", that's not too bad. But you can't properly receive, for example, a 3 MHz (wavelength: 100 m) signal with an antenna that's meant to receive a 2.4 GHz (wavelength: 1/8 m). </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the electrons in the wire will bounce back and forth in sync with the alternating field,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly! The electrical field that is the wave ""pulls"" and ""pushes"" the electrons in the antenna. If we make sure the antenna is sized and shaped just right to push and pull the electrons with the most force possible, we get the strongest reception!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>moving faster and faster with each oscillation (resonance). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The speed is fixed (it's given by the frequency of the radio wave, which is just the speed of light divided by the wave length), but with resonance, we can make much stronger currents.</p>

<p>I think this calls for an analogy: get a (maybe just in your head) bucket of water. Hold it between your hands. </p>

<p>Slightly push it back  and forth. For some amounts of times pushing the bucket back and forth per second, the ripples on the water aren't really big. But for others, the water gets really troubled and starts making extremely high peaks! You've hit the <em>resonant frequency</em> of your water/bucket system.</p>

<p>With electrons, antennas and a tuned receiver, the same happens: a specific wave frequency (that is, a specific wavelength) is able to rock the electrons <em>just</em> at the right rate so that the peaks get really high.</p>

<p>Now, in your bucket experiment, the bucket is fixed, and you find the frequency that resonates well. </p>

<p>Unlike you with your bucket, the frequency is fixed (because you want to receive a specific station!), so you have to vary your bucket: Essentially, tuning your receiver is the same as shrinking or growing your bucket. The bigger the bucket, the lower the resonant frequency becomes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I also understand how audio can be embedded in an AM signal using amplitude modulation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Great! In essence, staying in the bucket picture: The audio signal would just be how high the peaks got, which is just a result of how strongly you pushed (maintaining the same frequency, of course, that's where it gets difficult with the bucket).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, I do not understand the diagram in the diy linked above. Where do the electrons flow? </p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/956lU.gif"" alt=""diagram from DIY article""> </p>

<p>So, the electrical field pushes and pulls the electrons in the antenna back and forth – that push/pull extends down the antenna wire up into the coil – which basically acts like a reservoir of water. You push in a little current, the next moment you pull it back out, and so on.</p>

<p>Now, the size of that reservoir determines at which frequencies we are in resonance. Which means, the amount of windings that are effective in the coil determines how much current can flow into the coil, get its energy stored in the magnetic field of that coil, and then flow back. </p>

<p>By selecting less or more windings with the alligator clip, you get less or more reservoir – thus, you change the resonant frequency of the antenna/coil system!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Doesn't splitting the circuit in the middle of the coil create two ""antennas"", each with a different resonant frequency? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kind of, yes! But the other half (not attached to the antenna) is attached to ground, so nothing is received there. Keen observation!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is the purpose of the resistor? I have looked up the internal design of piezoelectric earpieces, and it does not appear that current flows all the way through them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly. Piezoelectrics react to <em>changes</em> in voltage, and other than that, basically isolate. To allow net current flow from the diode to ground, you'll need something that always passes current.</p>

<p>Now, using this resistor means that you won't get all energy that you've received to drive your ear piece, but that's not all that bad.</p>

"Replacing hand-wound inductors with store-bought versions","260","","<p>I'm wading through some schematics for a direct conversion I-Q SDR receiver, and there is an L-C band-pass filter on the input. Each inductor is specified by an inductance, a toroidal core material, a wire gauge (AWG), and a number of turns. I understand that this is all the information that is required to replicate the exact specified inductor (and all the values check out), and I know I could replicate the part described in the schematic. </p>

<p>However, I would like to avoid manually building a component like an inductor if I can ( because of logistics and personal enjoyment). While I can certainly select an inductance value from a menu on Digikey, there is more to inductors than just the value. I suspect the self-resonant frequency (SRF) needs to be well above the frequency of interest, and the Q of the inductor should be high, but past that I'm not sure what is important.</p>

<p>What problems am I going to run into if I switch from hand-wound toroidal inductors to a ""store-bought"" inductor such as <a href=""http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/AIML-1206-R56K-T/535-11688-1-ND/2782903"">this one</a>?</p>
","<p>I'm going to say a lot of stuff that could go wrong, but really, don't be discouraged. I think mostly ham equipment is built with self-wound inductors because cores and magnet wire is cheap and easy to source. Take apart a cell phone and you may not find a single wound inductor on it. None of the problems to follow are insurmountable, if they are even problems at all. Of course, it always depends on the application and circuit.</p>

<p>You are right to care about the self-resonant frequency and Q. Generally a high SRF and Q is good, but in some circuits it may be a problem merely that they are <em>different</em>, if the design already compensates for the non-ideal components of the self-wound part. Probably not an issue except in the most critical filters, and probably nothing that can't be fixed by adjusting a capacitor or resistor to compensate. This is why high SRF and Q are desirable: you can always make them lower by adding parts, but you can't make them higher.</p>

<p>All ferrite-cored inductors get lossier with increasing frequency. Generally, ferrites for low frequencies can provide a higher permeability (thus increasing inductance per turn), but as frequencies increase so do losses, necessitating lower loss ferrite materials with a lower permeability. <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/questions/1159/how-does-one-read-a-ferrite-datasheet"">How does one read a ferrite datasheet?</a> gives some insight into the parameters of the ferrite itself. </p>

<p>So, also check the intended frequency of operation for your considered chip inductor. If the datasheet doesn't say otherwise, you can assume that the test frequency is near the top of frequencies for which the part is suited. You could go a little higher if you don't much care about losses or Q. If you go a lot higher you might as well buy a resistor.</p>

<p>Other problems you might encounter, generally:</p>

<p><strong>Reduced power handling</strong></p>

<p>The smaller surface area of a chip inductor makes it less able to radiate heat, and its smaller mass makes it heat more quickly for a given power. Probably a non-issue for receive filters, maybe an issue for transmit filters.</p>

<p><strong>Lower saturation current</strong></p>

<p>Again driven by smallness, chip inductors will typically have less ferrite material per ampere-turn of wire in it, which increases inductance per physical size, but decreases saturation current.</p>

<p>Besides the possibility of outright saturating the core, you can probably measure higher non-linear distortion in a chip inductor with the right equipment. This is because saturation isn't a hard wall, but something that sets in gradually. The less magnetized the core is, the more linear it is. If the core is made smaller but inductance is held constant, the core must be more magnetized, and thus less linear. The difference may be slight, and not important for many applications.</p>

<p><strong>Higher ohmic losses</strong></p>

<p>The smaller size of surface mount components usually dictates smaller conductors, which have higher resistance, and thus higher loss and lower Q.</p>

<p><strong>More leakage</strong> (in some designs)</p>

<p>Some, but not all chip inductors do not have a closed magnetic circuit. This can lead to mutual inductance with others on the board, making transformers where you don't want them. Read the datasheet to see what you are getting. The example you provided says it is ""magnetically shielded"", suggesting a closed magnetic circuit.</p>

<p>My questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is there any danger in living 10 meters from such antenna?</li>
<li>Is there any way to measure the transmit power (using some application or device)?</li>
</ol>
","<p>Cellular networks are heavily regulated all over the world. Part of these regulations is that there's no amount of power radiated in any inhabitable direction that would pose a risk to the health of any human being.</p>

<p>Yes, there are ways to measure the transmit power, but you'd need to measure that in the antenna cable (and there's no way they'd let you do that). You can measure the field strength at the point where you stand, and that's probably more useful for you.</p>

<p>However, two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>It's already guaranteed by the fact that the antenna is where it is that it's aligned and powered in a way that makes sure no harm will be done, and someone with a very expensive measurement device measured that after setting up the antenna, anyway.</li>
<li>Such measurements require very expensive equipment, a lot of know-how and the chance to measure all relevant usage scenarios: A base station with only a few handsets that are very close will only transmit a tiny fraction of the power it would transmit if it had hundreds of handsets very far away. The power and the direction of base stations are adaptable, and you have no influence whatsoever on that.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, for me, as a studied electrical engineer: I wouldn't worry.</p>

<p>I answered another question on electronics.SE a couple hours back, and there, someone had dug up a magic, passive ""ring"" of some simple diodes that the seller claims would be able to detect GSM signals – which is total nonsense, as a single cell phone  would under almost no circumstances transmit enough power to light up an LED – that'd be illegal, and also, stupid, because the battery would be empty within minutes. Don't believe people that try to sell you fear about radio waves. Yes, you can cook meals and kill animals with microwave radiation, but for all we know and can scientifically prove (and we've been doing the GSM ""experiment"" on about 3 to 6 Billion people for about 25 years now) it's not harmful.

"What frequency to set trap on?","257","","<p>I plan to build trapped multiband dipole so I read lots of documentation I found.</p>

<p>There is one thing that confuses me: various authors recommend setting resonant trap frequency differently: some say trap should be resonant just below wanted band, some says it should be resonant in middle of the band, and some say trap should resonate just above the band.</p>

<p>What is correct approach?</p>
","<p>In tuning a trap there are two concerns which are somewhat contradictory:</p>

<ol>
<li>You want the trap to have a high impedance on the target band.</li>
<li>You want losses to be low.</li>
</ol>

<p>The objective of a trap is to reduce the currents on the inactive portion of the antenna to a negligible amount. This doesn't require an impedance that's as high as possible: it requires only an impedance that's high enough.</p>

<p>In any LC circuit such as a trap, the current or voltage circulating between the inductor and capacitor is at a maximum at resonance. The trap is a parallel LC circuit and a high impedance (high ratio of voltage to current) at resonance. Because the capacitor and inductor are in a loop, current can flow around that loop without adding to the current through the trap. That circulating current serves to charge the capacitor to a high voltage in cooperation with the voltage applied to the trap, allowing a higher voltage to be attained with less current (the definition of high impedance). But this high circulating current means high resistive losses, and the high voltage means high dielectric losses.</p>

<p>Logically then, we want to tune the trap such that the impedance in the operating band is high enough, but no higher. In practice putting the the trap resonance just outside the band is effective: for any reasonable trap design this will provide an impedance that is high enough, while keeping the resonance and associated high losses where they will not be encountered in operation.</p>

<p>Tuning resonance to be above or below the band does not matter much. It will affect the phase shift between the active and inactive sections of the antenna, but since the inactive section of the antenna has not much current on it, this isn't very important. It will have some effect on the tuning of the antenna, and the electrical length of the antenna on bands where the trap is bypassed. But these are all things easily compensated when tuning the antenna by adjusting length, etc.</p>

"Linksys WRT54G turned in to a brick","254","","<p>I just bought my first WRT54G (V3), and wanted to build a mesh network (Using the Broadband-ham firmware, <a href=""http://www.broadband-hamnet.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.broadband-hamnet.org/</a> , which as I understand is based on OpenWrt). I wasn't paying careful enough attention, and downloaded the firmware for the WRT54G v1, and burned it. I'm unable to get to any online documentation, and have been working my way though troubleshooting this. Here's what I can figure out.</p>

<ol>
<li>I can get the router into safe mode. I can't figure anything from there that's useful I can do, but I've done it.</li>
<li>The router accepts pings on 192.168.1.1, giving a TTL code 100 if I start from the beginning, and 64 if in safe mode.</li>
<li>I have this hooked up to a Windows 7 machine. I've tried using the TFTP software, but while it occasionally looks like it's trying to erase the firmware. It stays there for a few seconds, then it looks like it times out, and tries again.</li>
<li>I've tried rebooting this while running a large loop on tftp.</li>
<li>I've tried TFTP also when running in safe mode.</li>
<li>I found that the error being reported is ""Code pattern is incorrect"". Any idea what that means?</li>
</ol>

<p>Any ideas about what else to try? I feel like I've almost got it figured out, but that last 10% is killing me... Thanks!</p>
","<p>After a long time pondering about this, I realized the trick. The first problem is that I had a version 3v of the router, and I installed the <code>3g</code> version of the software. That doesn't work at all. I should have used the file <code>bbhn-1.1.2-wrt54g-2.4-squashfs.bin</code> instead of <code>bbhn-1.1.2-wrt54g3g-2.4-squashfs.bin</code> (For the latest, probably something different for the older version).
As for fixing the problem, the solution involved was the following</p>

<ol>
<li>Set up a fixed IP address on a computer.</li>
<li>Run <code>""ping -t 192.168.0.1""</code>, which will continually ping the router.</li>
<li>Reboot the router, holding the reset button.</li>
<li>If you see a message with <code>""TTL=100""</code>, you've hit the mark! Otherwise, keep trying.</li>
<li>Run the <code>tftp</code> program, available in a few places on the Internet.</li>

Will this improve if I add a balun to the center?</p>
","<p>A 1 wavelength dipole will always present a high impedance. Low feedpoint impedance occurs at odd half wave harmonics, so 1 half wave, 3 half waves, etc. A 40m dipole will usually present an acceptable SWR on 15 meters, not 20. A 4:1 balun at the feed point may allow you to tune the antenna on 20 meters, but losses in the coax will be extremely high on both bands then, because of the transformation of the impedance on both 40m and 20m without achieving a perfect match on either. A better bet is to turn it in to a fan dipole by adding a 20 meter element to it, which should give you a nice triband antenna.</p>

<p>That said, dipoles should always have baluns if at all possible, ideally ferrite toroid 1:1 choke baluns, as these have a wide bandwidth and will keep RFI to a minimum. While single band dipoles will often work without one, they're more prone to causing or receiving RFI and noise due to common mode current on the coax shield.</p>

"Is it legal to put IRLP on a 2 meter repeater?","251","","<p>I heard that it is illegal to put IRLP linking onto a repeater on 2 meters in the USA.  I was wondering if this was actually the case.</p>
","<p>The <a href=""http://www.arrl.org/voip-faq"" rel=""nofollow"">ARRL has addressed this in detail</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>Is It Legal?</h2>
  
  <p>By Brennan Price, N4QX and ARRL General Counsel Chris Imlay, W3KD</p>
  
  <h2>What Part 97 regulations govern VoIP-assisted Amateur Radio?</h2>
  
  <p>All of them or none of them, depending on whether you're asking about the ""VoIP-assisted"" or the ""Amateur Radio"" part of VoIP-assisted Amateur Radio. Follow this link for a PowerPoint presentation on VoIP by Mike Goldberg, K1LJN.</p>
  
  <p>Many callers to the ARRL's Regulatory Information Branch over the last few years have focused on the novelty of the Internet when asking questions about the legal uses of certain systems. Such focus is misdirected. Part 97 does not regulate systems; it regulates stations. The Commission doesn't care what a ham has feeding his or her station; it cares that the station--not the Internet, but the station--is properly operated. And all the rules that apply to any Amateur Radio station apply to one that retransmits audio fed to it by VoIP.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The gist of it is this: it's not illegal. All the FCC cares about is your station, and what you transmit. If your transmissions come from the internet instead of a microphone, more power to you. Just be sure those transmissions comply with the regulations like everything else.</p>

<p>It does not matter if the protocol you use on the internet is encrypted or not. Part 97 regulates the RF emissions from your station, not what you do on the internet.</p>

I am almost done building a 35W HF amplifier and once I've done some other testing, would like to look at the spectrum of the final output as a whole.</p>

<p>The most natural tool for this job would be a spectrum analyzer, of course, but any of my SDR receivers and/or the VNA should be able to handily gather spectrum data as well. The trouble is: all of my equipment is rated for input in the ballpark of 0dBm, i.e. milliwatts or less. It looks like even a ""real"" spectrum analyzer like the entry-level <a href=""https://www.rigolna.com/products/spectrum-analyzers/dsa800/dsa815-tg/"">Rigol DSA815-TG</a> has input rated around +20 dBm (100 milliwatts).</p>

"Why is coax the most common feedline?","248","","<p>Why is coaxial cable the most common feedline in use? What are the advantages/ disadvantages of coax compared to other feedline types?</p>

<p>From test pool question: T9B03</p>
","<p>At most amateur radio frequencies, there are really only two feedline types that are readily available and effective:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin-lead"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">twin-lead</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coaxial_cable"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">coaxial</a></li>
</ol>

<p>The goal of the feedline is to move electromagnetic energy from one end to the other without much loss. This means not absorbing it, and not radiating it.</p>

<p>Not absorbing EM energy is pretty easy. Use good conductors, like copper, and low-loss dielectrics, like PTFE or air.</p>

<p>Not radiating is harder. EM energy consists of electric and magnetic fields that <em>want</em> to radiate. You have to somehow have fields in the cable (because this is the energy you want to move) but not everywhere else. So you somehow have to make opposing fields that cancel each other everywhere outside your feedline.</p>

<p>Twin-lead does this in a pretty simple way: because each of the conductors carry equal and opposing currents (<a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/q/538/218"">or it should, if the station is operating properly</a>), they make equal and opposing fields. If you are far away from the cable, then the two conductors are close enough together that they mostly cancel each other out. There is no field far away from the cable, i.e., it doesn't radiate.</p>

<p>This is also the problem with twin-lead. If there is a significant difference between the distances to the two conductors, then you aren't far enough away for the fields to have canceled. If you are a conductive material, your charges will be pushed around by these fields, and you will alter the electrical properties of the cable, and your own electrical properties will be altered. If you are, for example, another feedline, your signal will be coupled with the signal in the other feedline. Further, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_impedance"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">characteristic impedance</a> of each feedline will likely be altered, making it harder to match to the transmitter, resulting in a poor SWR.</p>

<p>Consequently, when installing twin-lead, one must mount the feedline in such a way that it doesn't come close (relative to the spacing of the conductors) to anything conductive. Usually this means running it up the tower and into the shack with stand-offs:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SaxOa.gif"" alt=""twin-lead standoff""></p>

<p><em>(from <a href=""http://www.starkelectronic.com/cmig7.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Stark Electronic</a>)</em></p>

<p>In practice, this can be a real pain. How do you get it through the wall? What if there are two antennas on the tower? What if you have a rotator? What if it snows?</p>

<p>Coax solves this problem. The shield acts as a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_cage"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Faraday cage</a>, entirely containing the electric field between the shield and the center conductor. Thus, coax can be installed directly on a tower, bundled with other coax feedlines, or buried without significantly altering its properties. The disadvantage is a higher cost, as the coax geometry is more difficult to manufacture, and requires more copper.</p>

","<blockquote>
  <p>Is the raw data coming from the USB dongle literally samples of the ~1090 MHz wave? Or is the carrier frequency first demodulated (in that case, what actually am I receiving?)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's downconverted, not demodulated, using a local oscillator, mixer, and filters. That is, the signal you obtain is the same as if the transmitter had its carrier frequency set to 0 MHz instead of 1090 MHz (ignoring for the moment the fact that negative frequencies don't exist as propagating waves).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is the relationship between sampling rate and bandwidth? (I've read that it's equal; e.g. 1 MSPS = 1 MHz, but reading about higher end SDR setups doesn't confirm this)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If your receiver has perfect antialias filtering, you can have bandwidth equal to sample rate (in a quadrature (IQ) system). In practice, your filter lets some out-of-band signals through, so whatever sample rate you pick, you get less usable bandwidth than that.</p>

<p>To demonstrate that the filtering is not perfect, find a continuous narrowband signal (e.g. weather radio), then change the hardware frequency gradually. As the signal gets closer to the edge of the receive bandwidth, it will decrease in amplitude — but when it gets to the edge it will <em>wrap around to the other side</em>, weaker! This is aliasing.</p>

<p>However, if you have a situation where <em>you do not need to reject nearby signals or noise</em> (that is, the signal you want to receive is stronger than everything else nearby in frequency), then you could use all of your sampling rate. But that is an unusual situation, and not robust against interference.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Isn't the ADS-B encoding scheme particularly sensitive to phase and sampling frequency differences (like if my receiver is slightly out of calibration)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this type of receiver, the phase and exact sample rate of your <em>analog-to-digital converter</em> is <strong>not</strong> the same as the phase and <em>symbol rate</em> of the signal you're receiving. Instead, the software has a a control loop which looks at the incoming signal (knowing its expected properties) and adjusts to match its phase and symbol rate.</p>

<p>The other way (phase-locking the ADC to the digital signal) is possible, but that requires additional hardware to precisely control the local oscillator, and makes the receiver hardware more specific to the characteristics of the particular modulation being received (rather than a general-purpose software-defined radio).</p>

CW takes so little bandwidth, it's pretty easy to slide past a CW QSO if you are looking for room to operate SSB.</p>

<li>Classic foxhunt with a small AM radio</li>
<li>Hitting powerpoles with a stick/mallet/sledgehammer (seriously) and seeing if this affects the received noise.</li>
</ul>
","<p>Some troubleshooting ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Check your radio's power supply for noise by substituting a battery and disconnecting the PS from the wall.</p></li>
<li><p>Run your receiver on a battery and turn off your main breaker. Make sure any battery powered computers/tablets are fully powered off. If the noise reduces, turn off all branch breakers, turn the main breaker back on, and one by one turn on the branch breakers noting any change in noise.</p></li>
<li><p>Install an additional 1:1 balun close to your radio. This sometimes helps prevent local noise pickup on the coax outer shield.</p></li>
<li><p>Check your coax for any open or marginal connections - especially
the shield connections. Try substituting other coax.</p></li>
<li><p>Eliminate the tuner and short patch coax and note any change in noise levels.</p></li>
<li><p>Take your transceiver to a location in the country with a portable antenna and running off batteries to eliminate receiver problems. Alternatively take it to another ham's QTH that isn't suffering from noise to check it.</p></li>
<li><p>Borrow or rent a battery powered spectrum analyzer and walk your
QTH and the neighborhood sniffing for RFI with a small dipole or loop.</p></li>
<li><p>After eliminating all other possibilities, call the power company and let them know you suspect a cracked insulator or bad transformer is causing RFI. They have techs that specialize in these sorts of problems.</p></li>

"Why does a counterpoise need to be grounded","242","","<p>I made a 1090Mhz antenna for ADS-B following the instructions from <a href=""http://www.sprut.de/electronic/pic/projekte/adsb/adsb_en.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sprut.de</a>.  The antenna looks like below and I made it from the copper centre of some stripped coax:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5OTlA.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5OTlA.gif"" alt=""Antenna diagram""></a></p>

<p>The instructions say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now we need a ""dummy-ground"", that has to be connected to the shield of the coaxial cable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why does this virtual ground / counterpoise need to be connected to the shield?  Will it be slightly less effective or completely useless if left unconnected?</p>
","<p>It will be mostly useless.</p>

<p>Every electrical circuit has current flowing in a loop. When a circuit contains an antenna, there are always, in some form, <em>two halves</em> to the antenna, which have opposite voltages and currents (and the current loop is completed by ""empty space"", <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/questions/3502/are-antennas-circuits/3511#3511"">much like in a capacitor</a>). When you see an antenna that looks like one wire sticking out, there is actually something else forming the other half, usually being whatever the circuit ground is (possibly a metal casing or a power supply ground).</p>

<p>What you have there is an unusual form of <em>ground plane antenna</em>, where a plane of metal (or approximation by wires) is used to form that other half. If you leave it disconnected, then you're removing it from the circuit (except for some very small amount of capacitive coupling) and the coax shield (and, in part, whatever it's attached to) will be pressed into service as the other half of the antenna. </p>

<p>This is undesirable because it means the antenna does not have stable characteristics (depends on metal near the coax), is not overall as far away from obstructions, and because noise from your receiver or other equipment that is conducted along the coax shield will be added to the received signal. (This last effect is not truly eliminated unless you also have a choke/unun at the feed point.)</p>

<p>(By the way, the instructions describe as a series of dipole antennas. Note that an ordinary dipole, with a feed point at the midpoint of the wire, does <em>not</em> require any sort of ground or counterpoise. This antenna has its feed point at one end of the wire.)</p>

"Colocated three orthogonal wire loops for lightning detection network","240","","<p>I'm considering building multi-turn wire loop receive antennas for a <a href=""http://blitzortung.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">blitzortung.org</a> lightning detection receiver. It has three separate channels for H-field antennas, operating simultaneously. </p>

<p>Typically, only two orthogonal loops in vertical planes are made and co-located, e.g like:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dI5MY.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dI5MY.jpg"" alt=""two orthogonal multi-turn wire loops in vertical planes, from skywarn-slm.at""></a></p>

<p>Having enough real estate available this time, I wonder if there could be any advantage in placing loops several meters apart. Aren't directional nulls suffering from the close neighbour - other loop? (<em>possibly</em> resulting in a poorer SNR for the given loop, if a near noise source would be otherwise in a deeper directional null)</p>

<p>Same question applies for adding a <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tz20I.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">third, horizontal loop</a>. Are there any advantages in not using the same mechanical frame? When co-locating, is there anything about the feeder routing to consider? (extremely: one could route the feeder of horizontal loop in question right along the side of a vertical loop).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tz20I.png"" alt=""""></p>

<p>I saw <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qHyjE.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">three colocated orthogonal loops elsewhere</a>, but that was quite a different application. There, only one of loops is connected to the receiver, others are open-circuit.</p>

<p>And lastly, would same considerations (from the answers to come) apply if <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/questions/899/what-does-the-addition-of-a-shield-to-a-small-loop-accomplish"">shielded loops</a> are used?</p>

","<p>The lightning detection antennas are not used in any sense to triangulate or to direction find through any other method such as phasing. The three antennas are there simply to provide quasi 360° detection of lightning events. The actual direction finding is accomplished by analyzing the timing of detected lightning events from multiple sites using GPS time stamping and calculating time of fight by comparing data from multiple stations. In other words, if there was only one receive site in North America, no direction finding could be done for that region. In fact, it is acceptable to have a station with just one antenna - it simply may not be as sensitive to lightning events from certain directions.</p>

<p>With this as the background, feel free to spread out your loops if that works for you. Many people don't have that luxury which is why they have the creative colocated loops.</p>

<p>The ""Blue"" receiver version, the latest, has differential preamps so do not use any type of balun between the antenna and the preamp. You could place a wound coax/toroid type balun on the feedline to the receiver but keep in mind that you are dealing with very low frequencies so the typical amateur radio designs will not work well.</p>

<p>The shielded loop antenna is not the type that hides the feedline. They are using the split shield design to form a so called H field antenna (which has nothing to do with receiving only the H field!). If you decide to use such an antenna, follow their construction notes. They are sloppy on the description of where the break in the shield should be. I would recommend it be placed exactly in the center of the circumference in order to provide an optimum differential feed.</p>

"Measuring Connector Impedance","240","","<p>Before discovering that connectors can have characteristic impedance, I ordered a bunch of adapters. I've noticed that I'm getting really sub-par performance out of the antennas I'm using and think I may have ended up with some 75-ohm connectors, but I don't have a VHF/UHF SWR meter and it won't be in the budget for a while yet.</p>

<p>How can I determine the characteristic impedance of a connector or adapter?</p>
","<p>You can look at them. The characteristic impedance of a coaxial transmission line or connector is a function of the geometry of the conductors and the dielectric between them. Connectors are standardized, so for a given impedance they have a standard geometry. The pins are usually different sizes, and the amount of plastic dielectric in the connector might be different.</p>

<p>The specifics will vary based on the connector of course. A quick image search should turn up plenty of examples, for whatever kind of connector you have. Common ham radio connectors are BNC and N which come in 50Ω and 75Ω flavors. You might also run into a TNC connector, which is really just a BNC with a screw instead of bayonet shield.</p>

<p>""UHF"" or SO-239/PL-259 connectors are also common. They were made in a time where ""ultra high frequency"" was much lower. They are fine on HF but less than optimal on VHF. They don't come in 50Ω or 75Ω flavors: there's just the one kind. They are basically shielded banana plugs and have a non-constant characteristic impedance throughout their length. Network analyzers didn't exist when they were designed, and that's why they don't work well on the upper parts of the VHF spectrum and above.</p>

<p>You could also measure the impedance with a network analyzer or time-domain reflectometer. But I'm guessing if you don't have an SWR meter, you won't have those things either.</p>

"Why is the speed of light rounded to 286 Mm in calculations involving frequencies below 30MHz?","240","","<p>I understand that in order to make the maths simpler, frequency ($f$) is expressed in megahertz (MHz) and the velocity of propagation in free space ($c$) for frequencies above 30 MHz is expressed as and rounded to 300 megameters/second (Mm/s). The actual speed of light is 299,792,458 meters/second, so expressing and rounding this to 300 Mm makes sense.</p>

<p>I'm confused why it is rounded to 286 Mm when $f &lt; 30\ \mathrm{MHz}$. Please explain. An excellent answer will show the maths.</p>
","<p>Electrical wave propagation in wire is about 95% to 97% the speed of light.  Since wavelength is most commonly used for building antennas, which involve conducting the wave from air into the wire and vice versa, the calculation is adjusted assuming the slower propagation in an unshielded conductor.</p>

<p>However, this 3% to 5% discrepancy is small enough at frequencies above 30 MHz that it is usually ignored for simplicity, and 300 is used instead. For frequencies below 30 MHz it becomes more significant and the adjusted value, <em>approximately</em> 95% of 300 Mm, is used instead - about 286 Mm.</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
\lambda_{\mathrm{m}} = \frac{(300\ \mathrm{Mm})(0.95\overline{3})}{f_{\mathrm{MHz}}} = \frac{286\ \mathrm{Mm}}{f_{\mathrm{MHz}}}

"Center frequency spike on software radio for mismatched/disconnected antenna","238","","<p>A while ago I was using a software radio receiver to perform some antenna analysis. I left the spectrum display on while disconnecting the cable and noticed that when the cable was disconnected I could see a very large spike in the frequency component at the center frequency of the display (where the receiver was tuned). I changed the center frequency several times and noticed the same spike appeared regardless of where I tuned.</p>

<p>Some time later I reconnected a cable and accidentally tuned to a frequency that was completely ""out of spec"" for the antenna I was using. The same spike appeared at the center of the display; I tuned around to several nearby frequencies and found that the spike stayed put. It disappeared when I moved back to a frequency at which the antenna was designed for operation.</p>

<p><strong>What is the nature of that spike</strong> and why does it appear when tuned to a frequency at which the antenna is not resonant, as well as when the antenna is disconnected?</p>

<p>Here's the FFT at the same frequency, but with no antenna connected. The spike is clearly visible here, and this is what I'm interesting in learning about.</p>
","<p>That is probably <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_noise"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1/f noise</a>. This is noise where each octave has equal power. At lower frequencies, each octave is narrow, and thus has more power per unit frequency. It is ubiquitous in every electrical circuit, and in fact a great many physical processes.</p>

<p>This will always appear at the center of your FFT, regardless of where the radio is tuned, as the center of the FFT always corresponds to the frequency of your receiver's VFO input to the mixer. For example, if the VFO is tuned to 900 MHz, then a 900.01 MHz signal will appear at 900.01 - 900 MHz = 10 kHz, after mixing. 900 MHz appears at 0 Hz after mixing, the lowest frequency possible.</p>

<p>1/f noise is present in all electronics, and this is why you observe it even with no antenna connected. It can originate in the components that comprise the gain stages of the receiver like resistors and transistors, and noise so generated then goes on to be amplified and made visible in the FFT.</p>

<p>Better, and usually more expensive engineering can reduce noise like this, but in your particular case it would have negligible benefit. If you compare the scale on the left, this noise is significantly below the RF noise floor when you have an antenna connected. Consequently, <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/a/2214/218"">you will realize very little benefit from reducing the noise</a>.</p>

<p>These are the steps of a basic FM conversion algorithm. My question is, what effect does each step have on the bit depth of the result of the step:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Step 1 - Decimate down to the relevant bandwidth (150khz). Doing so reduces the sample rate but increases the bit depth.</p></li>
<li><p>Step 2 - Take the arctan of the resulting IQ samples. The combination of the I and Q parts further increases the bit depth of the current data.</p></li>
<li><p>Step 3 - Use a differentiator to get the final audio result. I am not sure how this affects the resolution, but since no data is combined, I suspect there would be no change.</p></li>

<p>Wikipedia has an explanation of the effect of oversampling on bit depth. But I am not sure about the arctan and differentiator processes.</p>

<p>Thank you for your expertise</p>
","<p>If all you want to know is what limit is placed on fidelity by the sample format of the SDR, there is a much simpler answer. Sample rate limits the frequency components the digital signal can represent, and the bit depth relates to quantization noise. If we can sample the entire bandwidth of the RF channel, and the quantization noise isn't a significant component of all the noise, then the digitization process isn't significantly degrading the fidelity of the demodulated signal.</p>

<p>At 2048 kHz, the sample rate in the example you gave is more than sufficient to cover a 200 kHz wide FM channel. So we are good on that front by a wide margin.</p>

<p>At 8-bit samples, the quantization noise is more than it would be with a more precise sample. But as long as the quantization noise is several decibels below the analog noise floor (which is itself a sum of RF noise and electrical noise in the receiver, among other things), then digitization adds only negligible noise to the signal.</p>

<p>Oversampling will not help you reduce quantization noise unless your SDR has an analog filter to reduce the bandwidth of the signal at the ADC's input. Indeed, the 2048 kHz bandwidth of the IQ samples is far in excess of the 200 kHz of an WFM channel. But if you aren't doing the filtering before reaching the ADC, that excess bandwidth contains information about other stations and noise outside the channel rather than extra information about the channel you wish to receive.</p>

<p>If you did have an analog filter, then you are oversampled by a factor of at least 8x. Every 4x oversampling effectively adds one bit, so you could reasonably convert your incoming 8-bit samples to 10-bit samples. With quiet electronics and proper application of noise shaping and dithering in the ADC you might even do a little better.</p>

<p>Practically speaking, you'd probably convert your samples to 16 bits at this point since that's convenient for most processors and it guarantees rounding error in the subsequent calculations are buried in the noise floor.</p>

<p>At this point, if the quantization noise is still not a few decibels below the analog noise floor, all the processing that follows is irrelevant. The signal has irreversibly been degraded. Once noise becomes mixed with signal, there's nothing that can be done to unmix it.</p>

"How to increase antenna aperture?","234","","<p>I know that in the short wavelength region, where parabolic antennas are used, the aperture can be increased simply by making the dish larger, as is the case with the radio telescopes. But how to do this in the RF? If I make a half wave dipole larger, its resonant frequency decreases. The other way I can imagine is to make an array of antennas working in phase, but in this case it gets more directional with larger number of elements. Is there a way to increase antenna aperture without making it directional?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Is there a way to increase antenna aperture without making it directional?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not really. You can make the antenna more efficient by reducing losses, but since antennas are usually designed for minimum loss already, there is probably no significant gain to be made in this direction unless you are starting with an electrically small or poorly designed antenna.</p>

<p>Radio telescopes do operate ""in the RF"", so what applies to them also applies to any other antenna. Increasing the dish size does increase the effective aperture. It also increases directionality.</p>

<p>If you didn't know it already, effective antenna aperture ($A_\text{eff}$) and gain ($G$) are essentially two ways of specifying the same thing. They are related by the equation:</p>

<p>$$ G = \frac {4 \pi A_\text{eff} } { \lambda^2 } $$</p>

<p>Assuming our antennas are already as efficient as we can make them, then we can't increase the aperture, or equivalently, gain, without also increasing directionality.</p>

<p>Here's why. Consider you have a 1W transmitter. If you send that power equally in all directions, then you have an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotropic_radiator"" rel=""nofollow"">isotropic radiator</a> which has by definition a gain of 1.</p>

<p>Let's just say you found a way to increase the gain of this isotropic radiator without also increasing its directionality. That is, it has a gain greater than unity, but still sends energy equally in all directions. Were you to construct such a device, I would surround it with a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere"" rel=""nofollow"">Dyson sphere</a>, which would capture all of the energy it transmitted. If your device had a gain of 2, then the 1W transmitter would be emitting 2W of power for my Dyson sphere to capture. I could then use the output of that Dyson sphere to power another instance of your device, giving me 4W. I could go on cascading instances of this device and obtain limitless power. It's a perpetual motion machine, so probably is impossible.</p>

<p>By <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_%28electromagnetism%29"" rel=""nofollow"">reciprocity</a>, it can be seen that the same thing is true when receiving. I can make an antenna array which has some greater gain in some direction, but it must necessarily have less gain in some other direction for some given phasing configuration.</p>

<p>If you provide a way to vary the phasing of the antenna, such as combining the signals from each element independently and dynamically in software, rather than in hardware, then you can pick the best phasing for a particular signal which might come from any direction. However, this requires that ""best"" is defined and measured dynamically. Modern radio communication systems do this, for example <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIMO"" rel=""nofollow"">MIMO</a> in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11n-2009"" rel=""nofollow"">802.11n</a>. However, it adds complexity to the system, and I guess might be considered as ""cheating"" as far as your question is concerned.</p>

<p>Alternately, you can provide an additional source of energy as an amplifier. This adds gain to all directions, so you could say it increases antenna aperture. Because you must supply the amplifier with additional energy, it is not a perpetual motion machine. While we use amplifiers all the time, we don't usually consider this as increasing gain or aperture because that way of thinking isn't very useful. If the antenna directionality is not increased, than the amplifier increases noise as well as signal. That is, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio"" rel=""nofollow"">signal to noise ratio</a> remains the same.</p>

"Variable phase antenna","232","","<p>I'm thinking about phased antenna arrays, and am wondering if it's possible to have three fixed position antennas, and vary the length of their individual feedlines to the common point through mechanical means.</p>

<p>The best way to describe what I'm thinking is making a section of coax out of two telescoping sets of tubes, one outside shielding, and one inside conducting. I'd probably shoot for something other than telescoping antennas, and I'd be using a cheap DC drill with either woven thread or an acme screw to move the inner parts relative to the outer parts.</p>

<p>I can leave one antenna connected to the common point via fixed length coax, and then connect the other two with these variable length coax devices in the feedline.</p>

<p>It seems like it's overly complicated, and that someone probably has come up with something better for switching a phased antenna array to point in any direction.  Surely someone has already built one (or perhaps it exists commercially and I just haven't seen it yet) or people have considered it, but other solutions are better.</p>

<p>What are other options I should consider?</p>
","<p>I don't know about mechanically steerable arrays, but there are several hams locally here that swear by a four-square electronically steerable arrays.  The setup is typically done for 40m and is an array of four 1/4λ verticals arranged in a square 1/4λ apart. You run one feedline to a remote switch located in the center of the square and 4 identical length feedlines go from there to the individual antennas. You orient the square so the sides point in the directions you want to favor.  A controller goes in the shack to steer the array.</p>

<p>One company here in the US that makes an excellent controller is DXEngineering.  The controller runs about 200USD, one plus the remote switch is about 600USD.  The manual is available online so you can read up on it and see if it's something you're interested in.

"What is the most common amateur identification practice for mobile US amateurs operating in Canada?","231","","<p>When a US Amateur operates in Canada, IT and Canadian regs permit some lattitude on their identification. I have read that some will prefix a ""VE3"" plus their own home callsign (Ontario, meaning I am in Ontario right now, but my real callsign is the following US one) on their callsign, some will simply indicate that that they are mobile in some way, and some may continue to use their regular callsign without indicating that they are mobile?

"Incoming angle of radio signal reflected off of ionosphere","230","","<p>I am about 870 miles and 16 degrees due west of WWVB at Ft. Collins, CO. WWVB transmits at a frequency of 60 KHz. At this distance I should be getting the signal reflected from the ionosphere. If I assume the ionosphere layer I'm getting the bounce off of is sixty-two miles high and it's a straight line between here and WWVB, using Tangent = Opposite÷Adjacent (T=62÷435), I get an incoming angle of 8.1°. Since I'm 16° away, I'm tilted 8° away from the midpoint between here and WWVB, which gives me an incoming angle of only 0.1°. This seems counterintuitive.<br><br>The reason I ask this is because I have a so-called atomic clock on my kitchen counter that does not get a signal unless I move it away from the solid patio cover next to the kitchen, but since the signal is at such a low angle, the patio cover shouldn't matter. I only need to move it a few feet for it to get a signal.<br><br>So is my math right, or am I missing something?<br><br><b>Edit:</b> I'm not sure where I got the 62-mile figure, but a Wikipedia article I found and a PDF state the altitude of the F Layer starts at 93 miles. With that figure plugged into the formula, it gives me an incoming angle of slightly more than 4°, which is probably just enough (can't measure it precisely) for the patio cover to come into play.</p>
","<p>Calculating the angle of an incoming signal traveling via skywave is not nearly so straight forward as you might presume, and there are two primary reasons.</p>

<p>The ionosphere is highly variable, and also exists not as a single impermeable layer, but rather a diffuse region several hundred kilometers thick. At any given moment, two signals of significantly different frequency will likely appear to 'bounce' from two very different altitudes depending on ionospheric conditions, transmitter antenna characteristics, and frequency of the waves. The height at which the signal appears to reflect is referred to as the ""virtual height"". </p>

<p>In reality, the signal is refracting over a relatively large physical distance, gradually bending back toward earth as it moves through the ionosphere. The distance over which the refraction takes place is dependent primarily on frequency, with higher frequency requiring a longer path. This means that if you have a 10MHz and a 20MHz transmitter with identical antennas, the 20MHz signal will have a longer single hop range, so long as the maximum usable frequency at the point where your signal meets the ionosphere is greater than 20MHz.</p>

<p>Things are further complicated by the highly variable nature of the ionosphere. Depending on time of day, solar conditions, and the state of the earth's magnetic field, the varying layers of the ionosphere can not only change altitude by more than 50% <a href=""https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/stp/iono/ionosonde/WP937_2009274.GIF"" rel=""nofollow"">over the course of a single day</a>, but they can even merge with other layers, or almost disappear completely. The F1 and F2 layers merge during local night to form a single layer, and the D and E layers are dramatically weaker or almost absent, for example. The F1 layer might begin at 150km at 10am today, but it could start somewhere above 200km at 10am tomorrow.</p>

<p>The exact range of a single hop also depends on takeoff angle from the transmitting station, as a wave with a frequency of 5MHz for example, is likely to return to the earth even if radiated nearly straight up, just as it would if it were radiated at 4 degrees above the horizon. Waves can also make multiple trips between the surface and the ionsphere, and there are times when two short hops can result in good reception, while a single longer hop may not.</p>

<p>In your case, you are well within range of ground wave propagation (nearly the entire continental US is for at least part of the day). At 60KHz, and a whopping 70kW ERP, the night time ground wave range is >1,000 miles.</p>

<p>Skywave propagation on VLF is finicky stuff. The ionosphere and the surface of the earth can form a waveguide that a VLF signal propagates along quite well, but this can vary depending on time of day and ionospheric conditions, as sometimes the altitude of the layers is not optimal for a particular frequency.</p>

<p>Lastly, if this were indeed a case of skywave 'shadowing' from a porch awning or other object in your home, the size of the shadow would depend on the electrical size of the object that's creating it to the wave that it's blocking. In the case of a 60kHz wave, an object would have to be absolutely <strong>enormous</strong> to create appreciable attenuation, as the wavelength is almost exactly 3 miles long. That means significant shadowing might require an object to be several hundred feet along at least one axis. </p>

<p>By comparison, the low end of AM broadcast at 500kHz is about 1 mile, and FM radio at 100MHz is just 3 meters. </p>

<p>Moving the object just a foot or two and seeing marked improvement, as you describe in the comments above, all but rules out skywave shadowing on this frequency. It is far more likely that you've got an issue with local radiated or  coupled interference that's rendering your WWVB receiver deaf.</p>

"Low frequency noise on ground line. Why?","230","","<p>I'm currently experiencing what I think is induced coupling on my ground line. Can someone explain how this is possible?</p>

<p>I live on the third floor of an apartment block and my only grounding option is currently the third prong of an ac outlet. I was under the impression that any low freq noise on the ground line would dissipate into the earth, however this is not what I'm experiencing. Any idea why?</p>

<p>I'm thinking perhaps there is some resistance on the ground-line and some rf and ac is taking a shorter path to my shack, instead of taking the longer route to the utility ground. I think this is happening because my apartment building doesn't have a ground rod in place and relies on the the utility companies ground, which is earthed who knows where.</p>

<p>I have an amp connected to my receiving radio and the utility ground I'm using at the moment is creating audible hum. I figure if I can use a quieter ground then this will improve the fidelity of any audio I want to amplify. Most of the interference is at 50hz (UK), which I guess is being conducted on the ground-line from my some of my neighbors apartments, although there's a lot from various other frequencies too. I plan on using some grounded coaxial cable connected to a rod outside with the intention of shielding any rf's from my hopefully quiet ground.</p>
","<p>This sounds like a basic ground loop problem. Make sure you don't have multiple paths to ground. Grounding every single piece of equipment, and the antenna sounds like it might be a good and safe idea but is not really good practice. Try several methods of consolidating your grounding method.  </p>

<p>We probably need more details but I would guess if you're in the 3rd floor of an apartment you're antenna is probably not outside, or it's at least not outside while you are not operating. In this scenario my guess is that you really don't need a ground for lightning or RF reasons. The electrical ground that's part of the third prong on your electrical cord is probably sufficient. If your receiver doesn't use any high voltages it may not even need the electrical ground. You could try bypassing that and just use the Amp ground and bond the chassis grounds together.<br>

"Use a TV coax and balun for a poor-man's OCFD?","230","","<p>Can I use TV coax and a cheap TV balun to build a poor-man's OCFD? Marginal performance is acceptable if it saves money. If I could listen to 10% of transmitters within a 100 mile radius that would be acceptable. And as for the coax length, probably no more than 20 feet.</p>

<p>Just getting started and not a lot of cash. Want to do lots of listening on both my RTL-SDR and Pixie 2 40M QRP kit. (Probably would build two antennas, one for each radio.) I already have a 75-300 ohm TV balun and lots of CATV coax. <a href=""http://www.packetradio.com/windom.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">Per this page</a> when an OCFD is 20-25 feet above ground I should use a 4:1 balun, which matches the 75-300 ratio, if I am not mistaken. And 25 feet is about the max height I can get by slinging up in the trees around my house.</p>

<p>I am aware that <a href=""http://www.jpole-antenna.com/2015/01/28/using-rg-59-or-rg-6-catv-cable-with-an-amateur-radio-antenna/"" rel=""noreferrer"">using 75 ohm line on a 50 ohm Pixie will result in at least a 1.5:1 SWR</a>, if not higher. And the RTL-SDR already has a 75 ohm input, so there's that. But I'm not going for excellent performance, just want to be able to listen to some of the transmissions in my region. Would be cool to pick up overseas as well, but that may be wishful thinking.</p>

<p>I may transmit, but that would not be a priority.</p>

<p>Oh and it wouldn't be strung up 24x7, just when I wanted to go listen then taken down the rest of the time. So I'm not concerned about lightning/rain/snow/wind.</p>
","<p>OK, let me try to answer this, but this answer may also be qualified as unqualified.</p>

<p>If you have a 50 Ohm receiver, and connect a perfectly (Z=R) 75 ohm antenna system, then your VSWR would be 1.5, and the ""load mismatch attenuation"" will be about 0.177dB. (with antenna <strong>system</strong> I include feedline)</p>

<p>I doubt that you would actually notice this.</p>

<p>However, you are using an RTL-SDR dongle with a source impedance of 75 ohm, and your feedline is 75 ohm, you use a proper 4:1 balun for a 300 ohm antenna, then you should be good to go. Even when you change over to a 50-Ohm receiver the loss due to mismatch is negligible. </p>

<p>The unknowns here is the suggested balun, and its behaviour when used with the OCFD. Unknown is also the quality and specifications of the ""TV coax"" you are planning of using.</p>

<p>As you are starting, and as you are only listening (no TX), I would actually fully agree with the answer given by <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/users/8717/mike-waters"">Mike Waters</a> unqualified or not.</p>

<p>Without knowing the very specifics of the TV-balun, and TV-coax, it would be hard for anyone to come up with a qualified or quantified answer for your particular question.</p>

<p>However, I did started off in this hobby as a SWL. And I have used unspecified components and material to build a range of antenna's.</p>

<ul>
<li>rule 1: any antenna is better than no antenna </li>
<li>rule 2: any feedline is better than no feedline </li>
<li>rule 3: it is a hobby in which you can go mad... watch your wallet </li>
<li>rule 4: it is fun to experiment</li>
</ul>

<p>For antennas I have used from rain gutters to water pipes, as feedline I have used from TV-coax to speaker-wire. </p>

<p>I have used a step-ladder as antenna... </p>

<p>Have I used TV-baluns ? -- yes I have, with various succes, pulled it down, swap in/out, try again</p>

<p>Have I used ""some coax"" ? -- yes I have, with various succes, sometimes it was just deaf... which means: replace.</p>

<p>Have I used a TV-balun with TV-coax and a OCFD ? -- no, I have no practical or qualified response to that...</p>

<p>As an SWL, work with the materials you have, work with what can be got cheaply, experiment, direct feed your OCFD, use the TV-balun... the succes rate is determined on what you hear, not what is calculated upfront. Then if you want to squeeze every single micro-dB out of your antenna system, then you can look at different materials/components, and budget for such.</p>

<p>And even when you calculate all this upfront, the moment you hang it outside in a tree or near a building, over real ground, the calculations may be off. </p>

<p>You do mention ""may transmit"", and just a word of caution here. If you really want to TX, then I would suggest to design/build an antenna for this with known components in order to avoid damage to your transmitter. This answer was written for RX not TX.</p>

<p>So far, I've build <code>Super Boomer</code>, <code>Special ZL</code> and <code>T-match</code>. And actually, I don't know which one is better. I only have a home brew RF strength meter here, and it seems they radiate the same strength.</p>

<p>So it's come to my mind that these driven things are big enigma to me. </p>
","<p>If your only concern is maximum gain, then <em>any</em> of the techniques you mention could be considered ""best"". They are all very good at what they do, they just do it in different ways. If your field strength meter is showing all the antennas producing a similar field strength at a similar distance and input power, then that's proof that they are all equally good, if radiating a strong and efficient field is your goal.</p>

<p>The choice of which techniques to use is largely based on factors other than performance. For example: a delta match can match only resistive loads, whereas a gamma match can also match capacitive loads. But, the gamma match is more difficult and costly to manufacture. The delta match works with a balanced feeder (ladder line), whereas the gamma match works with an unbalanced feeder (coax).</p>

<p>As another example: a simple dipole radiator is easy to manufacture. A folded dipole has four times the impedance of the equivalent dipole. The parasitic elements of a Yagi tend to lower the feedpoint impedance, so increasing it with a folded dipole might be good. But if you already have some other matching technique, then maybe the folded dipole is useless complexity.</p>

","<p>Yes they can.</p>

<p>You are right that the cheap HTs don't have much of a useful meter (I own a couple). Two easy solutions are 1) body fade and 2) directional antennas.</p>

<p><strong>Body Fade</strong></p>

<p>Hold your HT close to your chest and turn around slowly, looking for the direction where your body blocks the most signal (the signal null).  Now you know that the signal is coming from behind you.  turn around, walk that way, rinse and repeat.  The signal should get stronger.</p>

<p>Note that the null you are creating is rather shallow.  At VHF/UHF frequencies, it can be filled in by signal reflections off of nearby objects.  So try to avoid large buildings, chain-link fences, metal signs, etc.  If you are not getting a good null, move to a clearer location and try again.</p>

<p>When the signal is so strong that you can't find the null, tune 5 or 10 KHz off frequency to put the signal into the skirts of the receiver's IF passband.  If your hand-held is dual-band (144/440 MHz) and you are hunting on two meters, try tuning to the much weaker third harmonic of the signal in the 70 cm band while performing the ""body shield.""</p>

<p>Disconnecting the HT's ""rubber duck"" antenna will knock down the signal even more.  Hearing the signal with antenna off is usually a ""You are here!"" indicator.</p>

<p><strong>Directional Antennas</strong></p>

<p>Fox hunting on 2m means there are a variety of simple directional antennas you could build that are also quite inexpensive.  A 3 element yagi is a good choice as a small loop.  there are several examples of yagis made from steel measuring tape, making them quite durable and easy to pack.</p>

<p>I find the usual diagrams confusing, and a verbal explanation better so here is a basically correct, but very simplified explanation. An SSB transmission is derived from an AM signal within the transmitter, which (AM) is produced by mixing the audio with the carrier. If the audio is a single tone, say 1 kHz, and the carrier is 1 MHz, we get  the carrier 1 Mhz and the mixer products, 1 Mhz -1kHz and 1MHz + 1kHz, or 1.000, 0.999 and 1.001 Mhz, all transmitted and received. An SSB transmitter does the same but with a filter that removes all RF frequencies except just those of one sideband, so we may get just 1.001 MHz, the upper sideband, transmitted. To get the original signal back the original carrier, 1 MHz is mixed with this, and among the multitude of mixer products we pick out the three we want, and we have the same as the original AM. ""1 MHz is mixed with this"" is what is meant by ""carrier injection"", and it needs an oscillator, a CIO, to produce it. Note the the CIO is necessary in the receiver only, not in the transmitter.</p>

<p>ANSWERED</p>

<p>Thanks to the answer from Kevin Reid, I have amended the text, and this is now my explanation. I have tried to avoid too much detail:</p>

<p>I was recently asked to explain why a ""carrier injection oscillator"", or CIO is needed in an SSB receiver but apparently not in an SSB transmitter. This is my explanation.</p>

<p>I find the usual diagrams confusing, and a verbal explanation easier to follow, so here is a basically correct, but very simplified explanation. </p>

<p>In fact, for SSB, both the receiver and the transmitter require RF oscillators. They may be called different things in the two cases, but they are playing essentially the same role: defining the carrier frequency.</p>

<p>In an AM transmitter the signal is produced by mixing the audio, from some external source such as a microphone, with a carrier which is produced by an RF oscillator within the transmitter. From the mixer, if the audio is a single tone, say 1 kHz, and the carrier is 1 MHz, we get the carrier 1 Mhz and the mixer products, 1 Mhz -1kHz and 1MHz + 1kHz, or 1.000, 0.999 and 1.001 Mhz: all these are transmitted and received. The detector stage of the receiver removes the RF components to leave the audio signal.</p>

<p>An SSB transmission is derived from an AM signal within the transmitter, with an additional filter that removes all RF frequencies except just those of one sideband, so, in the case cited, we may get just 1.001 MHz, the upper sideband, transmitted. To get the original signal back in the receiver the original carrier, 1 MHz, is mixed with this, and among the multitude of mixer products we pick out the three we want, and we have the same as the original AM for the detector stage. ""1 MHz is mixed with this"" is what is meant by ""carrier injection"", and it needs an oscillator, a CIO, to produce it. Note that the oscillator is called the CIO only in the receiver: in a transmitter it is called the RF oscillator, or VFO if the transmitter is tuneable.</p>
","<p>Your description is not wrong, but your premise is. In the system you describe, both the receiver and the transmitter require oscillators at 1 MHz. They may be called different things in the two cases, but they are playing essentially the same role: <em>defining the carrier frequency</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In the transmitter, the oscillator's frequency is <em>added</em> (in the frequency domain) to the audio signal, producing an RF signal.</p></li>
<li><p>In the receiver, the oscillator's frequency is <em>subtracted</em> from the received RF signal, producing an audio signal.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In practice, SSB receivers and transmitters both have more than one oscillator — one <em>variable-frequency oscillator</em> (VFO) plus one or more fixed <em>intermediate frequency</em> (IF) oscillators. This is not fundamental to the modulation, but rather a technique to make implementing the required filtering more practical.</p>

<hr>

<p>If you are receiving AM rather than SSB you can avoid having any oscillator in the receiver at all, in favor of a variable filter, as used in crystal or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuned_radio_frequency_receiver"" rel=""nofollow"">TRF</a> receivers. However, this is the opposite of your claim. (It is possible because the carrier present in the transmitted signal essentially replaces the function of the local oscillator in the receiver.)</p>

"What is the average fade margin required for proper operation at 2.4 GHz?","225","","<p>I have two radios. Sensitivity is -84&nbsp;dBm and transmitting EIRP is +30&nbsp;dBm. How much distance should I expect?</p>

<p>I want it to be somewhere near about 2-3&nbsp;km. Is it possible? </p>
","<p>Your question can be answered by the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friis_transmission_equation"" rel=""nofollow"">Friis transmission equation</a>. One way to write it is:</p>

<p>$$ P_r=P_t+20\log _{10}\left({\frac {\lambda }{4\pi R}}\right) $$</p>

<p>Where:</p>

<ul>
<li>$P_r$ is the received power (in dBm)</li>
<li>$P_t$ is the transmitted power</li>
<li>$\lambda$ is the wavelength</li>
<li>$R$ is the distance between the antennas, in the same units as wavelength</li>
</ul>

<p>Wavelength at 2.4GHz is about 0.125m. With your numbers of 30dBm, and a maximum distance of 3km, the equation becomes:</p>

<p>$$ \begin{align}
P_r&amp;=30 \:\mathrm {dBm}+20\log _{10}\left({\frac {0.125\:\mathrm m}{4\pi \cdot 3000 \:\mathrm m}}\right) \\
&amp;= 30 \:\mathrm{dBm}-109.6 \:\mathrm{dBm} \\
&amp;= -79.59 \:\mathrm{dBm}
\end{align} $$</p>

<p>This is about 4dB above your specified minimum of -84dBm, so it's theoretically possible, but only barely. The Friis equation calculates received power for ideal propagation in free space between isotropic antennas.</p>

<p>Your receive antenna probably has some gain which gives you some additional margin. A resonant dipole has theoretically a 1.76 dBi gain, which adds to the number calculated above. Of course if you have a more directional antenna you get even better improvements.</p>

<p>However, you also aren't propagating through free space. You can approach this with a very good path: antennas on towers, clear line of sight, and so on. You must also consider the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_zone"" rel=""nofollow"">Frensel zone</a> around the path also. If all of these conditions are very good, your losses compared to free space will be small or negligible. If not, you will need additional antenna gain or transmit power to make your link work.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Sunlight has <strong>extremely small wavelengths</strong>, several orders of magnitude less than (to use the distance you mentioned) a foot. This means that the interactions of any given portion of the light with a solar panel (or even an ordinary dark object getting heated) occur in very small areas of the material, so if you analyze it as if it were an antenna, it's more like an array of tiny antennas than a bigger-in-some-dimension single antenna.</p>

<p>In the case of a radio wave interacting with a dipole antenna, for example (not that far from the case of your quagi), <strong>the entire antenna is built around half-wavelength dimensions.</strong> The area of the incoming electromagnetic wavefront that this antenna is interacting with is <em>not</em> the length and thickness of the wire, it is more like a circle whose diameter is the antenna length. (Reality is much more complex than this; there are no simple geometric shapes, but this will do for now.) Thus, making the wire thicker does not gather significantly more energy.</p>

<p>The analogy to making your solar panel two square feet instead of one is making two identical antennas, not too close to each other and connecting them in parallel. This is not a perfect analogy, because solar cells (and heating) are treating the radiation as <em>non-coherent</em>, meaning the phase of the signal is discarded and only the amplitude is kept. For coherent reception, as used in radio communications, the math works out that any such array of antennas or any other means of gathering more energy makes the antenna <em>more directional.</em> That's why we measure both properties as a single value, the “gain” of the antenna.</p>

<p>You can in theory gather more energy from a radio signal without increasing directionality, by using multiple antennas and multiple <em>receivers</em> as well — by independently demodulating from each antenna you avoid the signals cancelling each other. Imagine building lots of crystal radios and combining all their weak audio outputs into one stronger one. When the goal is actually to gather electric power from the RF field (in which case all you need is the diode rectification, no filtering or audio transducer), this is called a <strong>rectenna</strong> and it can be built into an arbitrarily large array just like a solar panel.</p>

"Regulated Power Supply vs Class 2 AC/DC Adapters","220","","<p>I'm wondering if it would be more efficient for me to replace several AC/DC adapters (linear, non-switching) with a regulated power supply?  Two of the adapters get very warm and are rated 9 watts input and 3.6 watts (12 volts * 300 ma) output.  So 40% efficiency doesn't seem that good and I don't need the heat.</p>

<p>Or are there good non-RFI producing switching adapters that you could recommend?  How does their efficiency compare?</p>
","<p>If by “a regulated power supply” you mean specifically a non-switching one as your second paragraph, then “a regulated power supply” and “an AC/DC adapter (linear, non-switching)” are exactly the same thing.</p>

<h3>Types of power supplies</h3>

<p>There are basically only three categories of Things You Plug Into The Wall And Get DC Out:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Unregulated linear power supplies.</strong> These contain a transformer, a rectifier, and smoothing capacitors. Their voltage output is significantly higher than rated when less than their rated load is applied, and their output has lots of “ripple” (a bit of 120 Hz AC on top of the DC output).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Regulated linear power supplies.</strong> These add a linear regulator circuit to the above, producing a stable, lower, output voltage. The difference in voltage, times the output current, is dissipated as heat; therefore they are <em>less efficient than</em> an unregulated supply, and most efficient when under maximum or minimum load.</p>

<p>“Laboratory” linear power supplies may add a current-limiting feature to this design. This is an addition to the <em>control</em> section but the power-handling components are the same.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Switch-mode power supplies.</strong> These produce a stable output voltage (or current, as in LED drivers) and do not dissipate heat, but they can produce RFI due to the high switching frequency. A well-designed switching supply will keep the noise inside the box by way of shielding and output filtering capacitors.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Any of these may come in “wall-wart”, “lump on the cable”, or desktop/benchtop form factors. This is determined more by their power rating (and hence their necessary physical size) than anything about their type of functionality, though a linear power supply will be larger and heavier than a switch-mode power supply of the same capabilities.</p>

<p>The “Class 2” mentioned in your question title is a <em>safety</em> standard: it says that the adapter is guaranteed not to produce <em>too much</em> voltage or current, so that the output will not pose the kinds of safety hazard AC line power does. This means both under normal operation (the maximum output current must not be too high) and possible faults (internal physical protection against the AC input jumping over to the output side).</p>

<h3>Replacing power supplies</h3>

<p>Historically, an electronic device might use an external unregulated linear supply and place the linear regulator on the main circuit board instead. Modern devices may also have linear regulators or switching converters built in, in order to accept variable voltage or to produce multiple lower voltages for internal use. In this case, you could replace a switch-mode power supply with an unregulated linear one, as long as its open-circuit voltage is not too high for the device's input circuit components. This will reduce RFI but increase waste heat.</p>

<p>It is OK to replace a regulated linear power supply with a switch-mode power supply of the same output voltage and current rating, or vice versa. The tradeoff you are making is efficiency versus RFI.</p>

<p>It is not OK to use an unregulated power supply with an electronic device that does not have an internal regulator, as the varying input voltage may be too high unloaded or too low unloaded, causing damage or incorrect operation. It may be OK to use an unregulated power supply with a merely “electrical” low-voltage device having only lamps, motors, and such, but it should be chosen to match the current rating of the power supply to the actual load of the device.</p>

"Does modulation affect propagation?","217","","<p>Does the modulation scheme, whether OOK, SSB, AM, FM, a digital mode, etc, affect the propagation of a signal?</p>
","<p>It depends on what you mean by <em>propagation</em>. If you mean, <em>does the modulation scheme affect the physical means by which EM energy gets from point A to point B?</em>, then the answer is <em>no</em>. Mostly, EM propagation is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_system"">linear</a>, so the differences in modulation have little effect on how the wave propagate.</p>

<p>However, if you expand <em>propagation</em> to include the intelligibility of the signal at the other end, modulation can make a very big difference. Though propagation can practically be considered linear, it is not <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-invariant_system"">time-invariant</a>. On VHF and UHF it's common for the transmitter or receiver to be moving. At HF, the ionosphere constantly changes, significantly altering propagation. Across all the amateur frequencies, there are properties about the radio channel that vary with time.</p>

<p>Different modulation schemes may be more or less robust against the disruptions encountered in practical RF channels. For example, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_frequency-division_multiplexing"">OFDM</a> modulation used in <a href=""http://codec2.org/"">codec2</a> provides good robustness against <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comb_filter"">comb filtering</a> caused by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipath_propagation"">multipath propagation</a>. It also provides <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_error_correction"">forward error correction</a> for additional robustness. This is why codec2 can offer many times the bandwidth of 300 baud <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency-shift_keying"">FSK</a>, while using less bandwidth, while working more reliability under more adverse conditions.</p>

<p>The differences among analog modulation schemes are less complex, but they still exist. CW works well for communication under adverse conditions because all of the transmitter power is focused in a very narrow carrier. On the other hand, AM spreads this same transmitter power over a wider bandwidth, and in that same bandwidth there is more noise the transmitter must overcome. Thus the principal advantage of SSB: it eliminates power wasted in the carrier and the 2nd sideband which carry no information. Furthermore, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetware_%28brain%29"">wetware</a> that decodes the baseband signal in analog modulation schemes is much better at detecting the pure tone of CW vs. the complex sound of a human voice in AM or SSB.</p>

I'm new to RF but pretty eager to learn.</p>
","<p>The important thing is that the antennas are in phase. That is, at the instant the electric field is pointing up on one antenna, it's pointing up on the other antenna. Otherwise, they won't add constructively. In the worst case, they are 180 degrees out of phase and they <em>cancel</em>.</p>

<p>Keeping the antennas in phase can be accomplished any number of ways. If the coax length to each antenna is equal, the phase shift introduced by the feedline will be equal, so the antennas will be in phase as long as you don't rotate either one.</p>

<p>If you were to rotate one to  be ahead 180 degrees in phase, you could compensate by adding an extra half-wavelength (at the appropriate velocity factor for your cable) of feedline, which adds 180 degrees of delay.

  <p>Are the oscillators in SDR hardware (that are used to mix the input to sinusoidal waves) purely digital?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The answer is the same as to your other questions:</p>

<p>The term ""SDR"" doesn't describe a single device architecture, and hence, all imaginable solutions to the problem of generating a tone for a mixer exist¹. There's SDR devices that have a numerical oscillator (pretty much what you described, though often implemented differently, and there's a lot of ways of doing that), others use PLLs (often with complex fractional-N schemata) to condition a LC oscillator, a quartz or some other source of periodic signal, yet others simply use a very high-frequency digital counter to generate a set of frequency, yet others have adaptable frequency multipliers; I'm sure there's even devices that simply have a bank of oscillators to select from (and combine); other implementations use tricks to avoid explicitly generating an oscillator at all and simply switch transistors on and off. </p>

<p>It is impossible to list all potential and actual implementations of oscillators. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Basically I am trying to figure out how the frequency of the oscillator of the HackRF is changed by software.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now we're talking about a specific device; I recommend referring to the <a href=""https://github.com/mossmann/hackrf/wiki"">HackRF wiki</a>, especially the page on <a href=""https://github.com/mossmann/hackrf/wiki/Hardware-Components"">Hardware Components</a>; you'll find a link to the <a href=""http://datasheets.maxim-ic.com/en/ds/MAX5864.pdf"">MAX2837</a> there.</p>

<p>Now, I neither want to nor can save you the labour of reading that, but to give you a short breakdown: </p>

<p>The MAX2837 is an integrated mixer/LO generator/amplifier... module. </p>

<p>It contains a Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO), which is controlled by a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL), which derives the desired VCO frequency from the external reference oscillator input, and uses a complex control scheme (selectable fractional-N or integer-N synthesis with selectable harmonics selection filters) to put the VCO at a specific ratio of the reference oscillator's frequency.
<hr>
¹ note that ""SDR"" doesn't even imply any mixing at all! Or, that you can adjust the frequency that is mixed with. That is a speciality of the specific devices you seem to be thinking about, and generalize! <em>Not all SDR devices look like the ones that you seem to be looking at.</em></p>

"Understanding WFM modulation","214","","<p>I am using ""HDSDR"" software to demodulate a WFM broadcast (""Classic FM"" in the UK, on 100.1 MHz, 192 KHz bandwidth).  I'm using an ""SDRPlay RSP1"" software defined radio and a cheap indoor discone antenna.</p>

<p>I'm trying to understand more about the audio demodulation and I'm puzzled by the spectrum display.  Here's a screengrab...</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lwmfc.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lwmfc.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Annotation ""A"" is (according to wiki) the ""Pilot Frequency"" at 19 Khz.</p></li>
<li><p>Annotation ""B"" is a rather fascinating pattern that is clearly part of the stereo audio modulation.  But it is centred at 38 KHz, which is far above human hearing capability.  Although I notice that it's also twice the pilot freq.</p></li>
<li><p>Annotation ""C"" is RBDS.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Question(s)</h2>

<p>What is the nature of the pattern in annotation ""B""?  When music is playing this area is rich with visible modulation.  But when it's just a simple human voice (the radio show presenter) speaking this area goes totally invisible and blends into the background without a trace.</p>

<p>I vaguely suspect that a human voice (0 Hz to 4 Khz or thereabouts) lacks the dynamic range to show up on the AF waterfall.  In contrast, a human voice speaking with some very quiet backing music (e.g. an advertisement track playing) does show up on the AF waterfall.</p>

<p>Is the station doing something special to the broadcast AF modulation during a musical segment, which is absent when the presenter is speaking?  Or is it literally that the presenter's voice isn't rich enough in dynamic range to even show up at all?</p>
","<p>Your “B” is the stereo difference signal of broadcast FM stereo.</p>

<p>It is placed at twice the pilot frequency so that it can be recovered by having the receiver lock onto the pilot signal and frequency-double it to obtain the <em>subcarrier</em> signal marking the position of the difference signal. The receiver uses this subcarrier to shift it in frequency down to the audible range.</p>

<p>The difference signal is the right audio channel subtracted from the left audio channel. The receiver adds the difference signal to the basic mono audio to obtain the left channel, and subtracts to obtain the right channel.</p>

<p>Thus, <strong>if the audio being played by the station is mono or mostly centered, the difference signal is zero or almost zero</strong> and disappears from the waterfall.</p>

<p>The primary advantage of this modulation scheme is that it is compatible with mono receivers (and a stereo receiver can fall back to mono for better sound quality if the signal is weak).</p>

<p>I am new to ham radio and can't so much.</p>
","<p>The SSB signal needs to be converted to the audio range so that you can hear the modulation normally.  The carrier that you inject acts as a frequency reference, defining the translation of each RF frequency to an audio frequency (after detection).   If you are transmitting a 1 kHz tone at 14,200 kHz, upper sideband, you are sending a single frequency, 14,201 kHz.  The receiver needs to inject 14,200 kHz ""carrier"" so that you will end up with 1 kHz audio after detection.  </p>

"SDRPlay RSP1 and broadcast band (AM) interference","212","","<p>I heard the SDRPlay RSP2 has an AM notch filter, but I don't want to spend that much money.  How is the RSP1 for broadcast band interference?  Will I need a preselector? I already have an MFJ-1020c but am hoping to sell it to offset some of the cost of the SDRPlay.</p>
","<p>It's not great, especially if you're in a densely populated area, but frankly neither is the RSP2. The RSP2's most compelling feature is arguably the High Z input, which does not include the AM BCB filter.</p>

<p>You'll see images throughout the LF and MF frequency range if you have strong AM stations in the local area. An additional preselector (it has a set of preselectors already built in) will help a bit, but a proper AM BCB band stop filter, a grounded metal enclosure, and particular attention to preventing common mode current on the feedline will get you a long way toward entirely eliminating overload.</p>

<p>The High Z input significantly improved performance on HF and LF, with better sensitivity particularly below 3MHz, and a bit better SNR as well, perhaps because of changes in how the signal is routed through/around the preamp.</p>

<p>If you're going to use it primarily for VHF and up, the RSP1 will do just fine. If you're going to use it for 80-10m, with a bandstop filter, I think you'll find it quite usable. If you want good low band performance, the 2 is worth the extra money, to be sure.</p>

"Antenna gain vs. radiation efficiency in 4nec2","211","","<p>I'm trying to evaluate HF antennas for low angle performance to pick from a list of designs that will fit in my limited space. I'm using 4nec2 to simulate them and compare the patterns.</p>

<p>When your simulated antenna has a low radiation efficiency, is the reported gain compared to an isotropic radiator with perfect radiation efficiency, or one with a radiation efficiency the same as your simulated antenna?</p>

<p>Here's an example to clarify because I'm not sure I'm using the right terminology. I'm comparing two antennas: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Antenna 1 reports 6dBi at 0 degrees azimuth and 10 degrees elevation, and it has a radiation efficiency of 80%. </p></li>
<li><p>Antenna 2 reports 6dBi at 0 degreez azimuth and 10 degrees elevation, but it has a <strong>radiation efficiency of only 40%</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Assuming everything else like ground and feed systems are the same, is the model telling me that the effective radiated power in that specific direction will be the same for both antennas, or will antenna 2 radiate half as much power in that direction because of the lower radiation efficiency?</p>
","<p>4nec2 takes the radiation efficiency into account when it calculates the gain.  You can see this for yourself by modeling an antenna made of copper and then writing down the gain, and then changing the antenna model to use a lossier material such as iron.  So 6 dBi is 6 dBi no matter what the radiation efficiency of the antenna may be.  To answer your question, both antennas would radiate the same amount of power in that specific direction.  But there is no such thing as a free lunch, so the lower efficiency of the lossier antenna surely shows up in the antenna pattern in the form of lower gain in other directions, even if the peak gain of 6 dBi is the same as the peak gain of the other antenna.</p>

"Filtering for PSK31 demodulation","210","","<p>What's the ideal filter for PSK31 demodulation? That is, something that minimizes ISI, while having a narrow bandwidth to reject adjacent channels, while being reasonably matched?</p>

<p>Most PSK modes use a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-raised-cosine_filter"" rel=""noreferrer"">root raised cosine</a> pulse shape, thus the receiver can convolve the received signal with an identical filter which is then both perfectly matched and zero-ISI. However, PSK31 simply uses a raised-cosine envelope, which I guess means there's a second order discontinuity at each transition between 0's and 1's which increases the occupied bandwidth, and also the appropriate receive filter is not so obvious. <a href=""http://bipt106.bi.ehu.es/psk31theory.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">G3PLX describes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that the transmitter and receiver filters have to be ""matched"" to each other for the ISI performance to be right. Some systems like this use a pair of identical receive and transmit filters which are matched. If I did this and someone else came along wanting to improve the performance, they would have to get everyone else to change their transmit filters. I have therefore chosen to use the simple cosine shape for the transmitter and match that in the receiver. This leaves the way open for others to develope better receivers without new transmitters being incompatible with old. This is slightly different from the SP9VRC approach.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The few implementations I've been able to examine use a set of filter taps copied from some other implementation, or don't specifically say what the filtering is.</p>

<p>Is there any detailed information on these filters? Or equivalently, how would one go about designing such a filter?</p>
","<p>So, to maximize SNR you'd use a matched filter (which is the conjugate complex of the time-reversed TX pulse shaping filter), and assuming the pulse shaper has been reasonably chosen, that'd also a ISI-minimizing filter.</p>

<p>Now, psk31.txt from the <a href=""http://bipt106.bi.ehu.es/psk31.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">original DOS program</a> says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The solution is to filter the output, or to shape the envelope amplitude of
  each bit which amounts to the same thing. In PSK31, a cosine shape is used.
  To see what this does to the waveform and the spectrum, consider transmitting
  a sequence of continuous polarity-reversals at 31 baud. With cosine shaping,
  the envelope ends up looking like full-wave rectified 31Hz AC. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, the transmit filter is half a cosine. (Not RRC. I've just corrected the wikipedia page – it said RRC.) </p>

<p>The same document doesn't state what exactly the RX filter is – only that it is supposed to be ""matched"" (which doesn't seem to mean the ""canonical"" matched filter above). The author's reasoning goes like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that the transmitter and receiver filters have to be ""matched"" to
  each other for the ISI performance to be right. Some systems like this use
  a pair of identical receive and transmit filters which are matched. If I
  did this and someone else came along wanting to improve the performance,
  they would have to get everyone else to change their transmit filters. I
  have therefore chosen to use the simple cosine shape for the transmitter
  and match that in the receiver.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I cannot help but feel this is bogus reasoning. Mathematically, it's clear that maximum SNR without ISI can <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matched_filter#Derivation_of_the_matched_filter"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>only</em></a> be obtained by correlating with the conjugate reversed TX filter – and that being time-symmetric and real in the case of a cosine filter implies you get the same TX as RX filter. Stat – there's no design freedom anymore once you've chosen the TX filter, no matter how you chose that.</p>

<p>Of course, you can correlate multiple periods (let's say 4) of RX signal with all hypothetical  permutations and get better SNR – but that's a lot more channel (de)coding than modulation.</p>

<p>So, best you can do is a cosine RX; everything else is higher-level error-correction. You should do that error correction – a trellis is your friend!</p>

"Feeding a dual-band UHF and VHF Yagi antenna","209","","<p>I just built a UHF Yagi antenna for my HT, and I was thinking about adding VHF elements. If I do, could I just connect the coax directly to both sets of elements without a diplexer?</p>
","<p>The diplexer allows you to separate the UHF and VHF signals coming from the radio.  This is useful if, for example, you wanted the uhf antenna and vhf antennas in different places or pointing different directions.   Or, if you had both antennas connected together on the same coax, but you wanted to feed them from different radios on the other end of the coax.</p>

<p>If both antennas are in the same place, a diplexer on the antenna end doesn't make much sense.  </p>

<p>Putting them on the same coax should work fine.  Generally, if the one antenna has high SWR at the other antenna's frequency, then this will act as a selector of which antenna gets most of the power from the coax at that frequency.</p>

<p>If one antenna is a harmonic of the other, the power could be divided between the antennas (like a voltage divider made of resistors), which could change the impedance significantly, and you might need to adjust the matching network, and the radiation pattern would be from both antennas.  Also, if the antennas are close, they might interact distort their mutual radiation patterns even if they are not sharing the power.  These two factors can be designed for, or you can just try it and see how it works.</p>

<p>Note that the 440mhz band is very close to being a third harmonic of 146mhz, so a 2m antenna with sufficient bandwidth might also have low SWR on 70cm.  If this is an omnidirectional antenna, you might not even need the 70cm antenna.   If this is a directional antenna, you might want the diplexer to separate the antennas to get the best radiation pattern for each band.   Note that the arrow satellite yagi has the two antennas on the same boom, but mutually perpendicular -- this minimizes interaction between them.</p>

"How does VHF/UHF propagate beyond the expected (radio) horizon?","209","","<p>I am not asking about the fairly well-known effect of the earth ""appearing less curved to radio waves"" that are otherwise still essentially line-of-sight, but a deeper arcanum:</p>

<p>In the ARRL Antenna Book, 17th edition (1994) there is a discussion of ""Reliable VHF coverage"" in starting on page 23-7 in the Radio Wave Propagation chapter. The claim is made,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because of age-old ideas, misconceptions about the coverage obtainable in our VHF bands persist. This reflects the thoughts that VHF waves travel only in straight lines, […] However, let us survey the picture in the light of modern wave-propagation knowledge and see what the bands above 50 MHz are good fro on a day-to-day basis, ignoring the anomalies [presumably referring to the tropospheric ducting of previous section] that may result in extensions of normal coverage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It goes on, after mentioning an article by D.W. Bray, K2LMG in the November 1961 QST magazine, to present two graphs that plot ""tropospheric path loss"" against distance. The curves therein rise steeply from 120 dB of loss at a distance of 0 miles [?!] to around 180 dB near 50 miles, then level off slightly so that at 500 miles there is a path loss around 240 dB. (That's reading the 50% reliability chart roughly, there's actually 4 lines plotted for 144/50, 220, 432, and 1296 MHz, as well as a second separate chart showing 99% reliability; the 99% reliability chart is very approximately 10–20 dB worse than the 50% one at any given point.)</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: thanks to W0BTU Mike, here's the actual charts scanned from an earlier edition:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JzMdi.png"" alt=""Path loss vs. distance for amateur frequencies above 50 MHz""></p>

<p>What ""modern wave-propagation knowledge"" is this referring to? What mechanism(s) would allow VHF signals to be 99% <strong>reliably</strong> received 500 miles away, albeit with more than 250 dB of path loss, or 50%-of-the-time reliability with a little less loss? (These path-loss charts do NOT assume any antenna-height gain.)</p>
","<p>Turns out that, after turning to discussion of HF propagation for a number of intervening pages, this Antenna Book ends up getting back around to its own answer for this question!</p>

<p>From the ""Scatter Modes"" section on page 23-30 of the same 17th edition:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The wave energy of VHF stations is not gone after it reaches the radio horizon, described early in this chapter. It is scattered, but it can be heard to some degree for hundreds of miles. Everything on Earth, and in the regions of space up to at least 100 miles, is a potential scattering agent.</p>
  
  <p><em>Tropospheric scatter</em> is always with us […] <strong>this is what produces that nearly flat portion of the curves given in an earlier section</strong> on reliable VHF coverage.  … As long ago as the early 1950s, VHF enthusiasts found that VHF contests could be won with high power, big antennas and a good ear for signals deep in the noise. … <em>Ionospheric scatter</em> works much the same as the tropo version, [… and] can fill in the skip zone with marginally readable signals scattered from ionized trails of meteors, small areas of random ionization, cosmic dust, satellites and whatever may come into the antenna patterns at 50 to 150 miles or so above the Earth. […]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[bold added for emphasis]</p>

<p>It goes on similarly to discuss ""backscatter"" and ""transequatorial scatter"" before going on to a different section on ""auroral propagation"" (which can also affect VHF but is probably <em>not</em> related to the reliable propagation graphs).</p>

<p>So in short, ""scatter"" (in many forms) is claimed as the mechanism that allows VHF signals to be heard hundreds of miles beyond the primary ""radio horizon"".</p>

<p>I also believe the ARRL editors consider the experimental discoveries of the various scatter modes to be the ""modern wave-propagation knowledge"" referred to earlier — in this ""Scatter Modes"" section there are a couple historical references around the same dates as the QST article, including the ""early 1950s"" one quoted above as well as Transequitorial scatter as ""an amateur 50-MHz discovery in the years 1946–1947"".</p>

","<p>Fun setup! I have many of the same components and need to try them out myself, but here's a general outline. (Plenty of this may be review for you, but I'm including it for others who may not be as familiar with your equipment.)</p>

<h2>The antenna</h2>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/D4Fwo.jpg"" alt=""Another picture of the antenna, from somewhere""></p>

<p>A <a href=""http://dl1dbc.net/SAQ/miniwhip.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">miniwhip</a> (see also <a href=""http://owenduffy.net/antenna/PA0RDT-MiniWhip/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this article</a> and <a href=""http://dl1dbc.net/SAQ/Mwhip/Article_pa0rdt-Mini-Whip_English.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this PDF</a>) is an active antenna taken to the extreme: it uses a tiny conductor to intercept a tiny bit of broadband electromagnetic field, and then amplifies it by a huge amount — perhaps on the order of +35dB gain.</p>

<p>Being an active antenna it will either need to be plugged in to a DC power source, or (as is more typical) you can ""phantom power"" it via a <a href=""http://www.kb6nu.com/power-remote-devices-via-yourfeedline/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bias tee</a>.</p>

<p>Also, the antenna is <a href=""http://www.pa3fwm.nl/technotes/tn07.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">amplifying the difference</a> between its whip/plate and its ground:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>without any conductive connection to the outside, the entire circuit will be at the same potential</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The typical installation recommendation has you attach the ground (or the shielded outside of its coax connection) of the miniwhip to a conductive and grounded mast. For example, <a href=""http://www.ebay.com/itm/MiniWhip-Active-Antenna-Assembled-in-Box-HF-LF-VLF-mini-whip-sdr-RX-portable-swl-/222469570201"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this eBay listing</a> mentions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For max. sensitivity:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>this antenna should be positioned as high and free from metal conductors as possible.</li>
  <li>the ground plane of the PCB must NOT be lower than the top of the mast. (the connection to and the antenna surface itself must be ABOVE
  the top of the mast).</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>For best signal-to-noise ratio:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>install the Miniwhip onto a well grounded mast.</li>
  <li>connect ""GND"" of the Miniwhip PCB to that mast.</li>
  <li>place HI-Ui ferrite cores […] on the beginning and end of all cables to block cable noise currents.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Generally with this antenna you are encouraged to avoid electrical noise on the whip and/or its grounding as much as possible. However, that may be something to go back and optimize <em>after</em> you've addressed the next topic…</p>

<h2>Avoiding overload</h2>

<p>Feeding a broadband active antenna into an 8-bit SDR without filtering will almost certainly cause all sorts of distortion/intermodulation/overload issues in the presence of strong signals.</p>

<p>You mentioned that you <em>could</em> hear ""radio stations"" which I assume are high-power broadcast transmissions. These loud signals might be preventing you from receiving anything else.</p>

<p>For the ""AM broadcast"" band in the USA, I found this <a href=""http://www.ok1rr.com/index.php/technical-topics/40-an-efficient-mw-band-stop-filter"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">AM band-stop filter</a>. These MW broadcasts do vary from region to region, for example I also found a design apparently for <a href=""http://vk3il.net/projects/broadcast-band-filter/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">blocking similar in Australia</a>. In Europe you may need a couple bandstop filters for various local AM and shortwave bands.</p>

<p>(As mentioned above, nearby electrical noise from computers and power supplies can also make strong interference.)</p>

<h2>Upconverted frequencies</h2>

<p>Since the RTL-SDR only tunes down to about 27MHz or so, you will need either a <a href=""https://www.rtl-sdr.com/direct-sampling-mode-hardware-modifcations/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">direct sampling modification</a> or an upconverter to tune in to most of the HF and lower frequencies.</p>

<p>It sounds like you have an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterodyne#Up_and_down_converters"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">upconverter</a>, so you need to find the ""local oscillator"" frequency, it may be written on the device or should be listed amongst its specifications. My ""full band"" RTL-SDR unit has an integrated upconverter using 100MHz. </p>

<p>The external <a href=""http://www.nooelec.com/store/ham-it-up.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ham It Up v1.3</a> uses 125MHz.</p>

<p>Basically what an upconverter ends up doing is ""adding"" its local oscillator frequency to every signal. So if you wanted to listen to 1040 kHz using a 125MHz upconverter, you would need to tune your SDR app to 126.04MHz at first.</p>

<p>However, this is a common technique and so most apps let you enter in this frequency offset so that the display becomes more natural. For example, Gqrx calls this the ""LNB LO"" input control. CubicSDR has something similar, iirc. Note that in some apps you have to enter ""-125 MHz"" (negative) and in others you just use ""+125"". Once you configure this, to tune e.g. 1040kHz you type in 1.040MHz directly in the display and the SDR app calculates the proper actual frequency for you.</p>

<h2>Which frequencies to try?</h2>

<p>If you're looking to hear Amateur Radio activity, you can start by consulting a <a href=""http://www.arrl.org/graphical-frequency-allocations"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">band chart</a> for the overall ranges where hams are allowed to operate.</p>

<p>Within each of these allocations, there is typically a <a href=""http://www.arrl.org/band-plan"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">band plan</a> that divides the available spectrum into particular frequencies recommended for particular activities.</p>

<p>The band chart/plans linked above are published by ARRL, the big ham lobbyist organization in the USA. Note that amateur allocations vary slightly between nations and regions. But since it's all ultimately coordinated via the ITU, there's typically a lot of overlap.</p>

<p>When I am looking for amateur signals, I often start with the <a href=""http://hflink.com/jt65/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">JT65</a> frequencies since those ""channels"" tend to provide a good density of long transmissions despite the low power typically used. E.g. if you listen at 7.039 or 7.076 MHz using an upper sideband decoder, you might hear a few 40m transmissions piled close together, sounding <a href=""https://youtu.be/fLI61ymgpjw?t=230"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">almost like bad music</a>.</p>

<h2>Squelch the static</h2>

<p>You are looking to ""disable big loud noise"", which made me first think of a <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/questions/1124/what-does-a-noise-blanker-really-do-and-what-are-the-side-effects"">noise blanker</a> but your description about setting a trigger level sounds more like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squelch#Carrier_squelch"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">squelch</a>.</p>

<p>Most full-featured SDR apps have both noise blanking (NB) and squelch too. Sometimes there are even separate RF (radio frequency, meaning the input signal) and AF (audio frequency, meaning the decoded/demodulated signal) squelch options. They vary from app to app and sometimes I've found using them to be confusing, but most SDR apps should have them if you know where to look.</p>

"How does a transceiver work?","208","","<p>I recently joined my university's Cube-Sat Program and was delegated the task of looking for software that modulates and demodulates signals (~437MHz, GMSK, AX.25). </p>

<p>The problem now is that I don't understand what is required. The signal comes through a Yagi antenna and a transceiver, so wouldn't the transceiver handle the modulation and demodulation and feed in bit-strings? And if so where does a Sound-card modem come into play here? Why do I see articles in which people used sound card modems to decode satellite telemetry?</p>

<p>Link to article:<a href=""http://www.pe0sat.vgnet.nl/decoding/satellite-telemetry/sound-card-modem/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.pe0sat.vgnet.nl/decoding/satellite-telemetry/sound-card-modem/</a></p>
","<p>The article does in illustrate things rather nicely.</p>

<p>Let's look at the receive side first:</p>

<pre><code>     Signal (@437 MHz)--&gt;(x)--&gt; filters --&gt; IF (@x)
                          ^
                          |
Oscillator (@(437 MHz-x))-/
</code></pre>

<p>What happens is that your input RF signal at $f_\text{RF}$ is multiplied in a mixer with a tone of frequency $f_\text{LO}=f_\text{RF}-x$. The output of the mixer hence, mathematically, contains the difference frequency</p>

<p>$$\begin{align}
f_\text{IF} &amp;= f_\text{RF}-f_\text{LO} \\
&amp;= f_\text{RF}-(f_\text{RF}-x)\\
&amp;= x
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>""LO"" stands for ""local oscillator"", by the way, and ""IF"" for ""intermediate frequency"".</p>

<p>You'd then typically either directly demodulate the IF signal, or downconvert it even further.</p>

<p>Now, you'll need some <em>hardware</em> to do all this, namely, something that offers the mixer, the filters (because the mixer produces a lot of other frequencies, too), amplifiers and so on.</p>

<p>The article you've linked to uses the <em>FunCube dongle</em>. Which is a bit of a dated device that <em>looks</em> to the operating system like a sound card. In fact, it's <strong>not</strong> a sound card, but an IQ receiver. What that means is that the IF signal is further mixed down, in fact, to a new IF of 0 Hz (we call that baseband), and in the process converted to two ""orthogonal"" signal branches (I and Q). </p>

<p>These two channels are what ""looks like"" left and right of a stereo signal. <strong>They are not audio</strong>. They are just that – complex baseband signal. </p>

<p>There's a whole lot of software that can demodulate GMSK in baseband, and there's a whole lot of software that does AX.25. However, which software to use depends on</p>

<ol>
<li>your hardware – it's no use if the software you use can't talk to your hardware</li>
<li>your operating system and computational environment – it's no use if you find something that works great on Windows 98, but you need your decoder to run on a screen-less Raspberry Pi somewhere in a box,</li>
<li>your data interface – it's no use if your software has a super nice GUI to show you received packets' contents, but you need the data to be streamed via network somewhere else.</li>
</ol>

<p><hr>
The FunCube dongle is a hybrid Superheterodyne / Quadrature receiver system that gives you raw IQ samples. It is the one used in the article. It's a receiver only, and since you said ""transceiver"", it can't be the device you're going to use.</p>

<p>This architecture is <em>not</em> the <em>only</em> type of receiver you can build. In fact, there's a lot of devices that are pure Quadrature mixing systems, or pure superhets, or directly, mixer-less undersampling systems, and all imaginable combinations of those, and that is just the range of things you'd find in common, general purpose SDR devices. There's no general answer to ""how does a transceiver work"", because non-SDR transceivers are purpose-built for exactly the signal they deal with – and an analog TV receiver is totally incomparable to an early GSM frontend (which, fun fact, used GMSK, but typically had ""overdriven"" single-transistor receivers at a low IF) or a garage door opener.</p>

<hr>

<p>So, your design process would probably be the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Choose SDR hardware. Your university is launching a CubeSAT – that's not a cheap hobby, and thus, I guess you could probably do better than a FunCube Dongle with a 192 kHz bandwidth, and an E4000 tuner that tends to misbehave in terms of phase noise. Chances also are you've existing receiver analog frontends – ie. LNA's, preselection filters and so on. Talk to someone who's knowledgeable about the available hardware! In the end, you'll have to plug your thing into an antenna that possibly already exists.<br>The hardest part in all this is properly defining what you need. You didn't say in which orbit your CubeSat will end up in – but chances are it's going to be a rather low, i.e. fast-moving one, and then your receiver's digital bandwidth should be wide enough to let you track the changing $f_\text{RF}$¹. So, maybe you should first ask a different question, namely ""<strong>What are the characteristics of my receiver that I have to note down as requirement when doing {insert what you're doing <em>exactly</em>}?</strong>""</li>
<li>Pick, or build, a receiver software</li>
<li>Test and refine.</li>

"Does the Crystal Radio really work?","207","","<p>I am in 12th std, the reason why I am mentioning this is that we are given a PROJECT to do in Physics subject. And then one day I searched the internet and found this amazing thing called 'Crystal Radio'. And when I showed it to my group(since it is a group project), their faces were like WTF??? Because the crystal radio works only on the energy of radio waves and no external power source!!! And my friends then started to ask me that how can this be possible... Then we went to our Physics teacher and he said that he made a crystal radio when he was in 11th and it didn't worked for him since the energy produced by the receiver is very small... I didn't knew what to answer to my friends then... So my short and simple question is that ""Does the Crystal Radio really works??"" And if yes then can you please provide the link to where can I find the working mechanism of a crystal radio... Thank You!!</p>
","<p><strong>Yes, crystal radios convert radio signals to audio without any additional power.</strong></p>

<p>But it is true that there is not much energy in a radio signal at any significant distance from the station, so a few tricks are involved to produce audio from that weak signal without any additional electricity:</p>

<ol>
<li>The earphones are special models that are high impedance and require very little current to operate.  Modern earbuds like you use with a mp3 player or cellphone have a low impedance and will not work.</li>
<li>These earphones are connected as the load to a high Q resonant circuit, which collects and concentrates energy at the desired radio frequency.</li>
<li>AM radio in particular can be decoded to audio with a diode or crystal.  Other more modern modulation types (FM, Digital Audio) can not be decoded in this way.</li>
</ol>

<p>Getting a crystal radio to work depends upon having some strong local stations, a good antenna AND ground, and not having a good ground will keep it from working.  If you have copper plumbing, attaching to the cold water service can be a good ground if the water service arrives from the ground without any plastic PVC pipes.</p>

"Optimising a small magnetic loop with 1:1 SWR but little radiation","207","","<p>I'm trying to build a small magnetic loop for 5W on at least 40m - 20m following ideas of <a href=""http://www.g4ilo.com/wonder-loop.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">G4ILO's wonder loop</a>. For this, I'm using coax with a ~2mm copper core and ~1mm spacing to the braid (see 1st image below), with braid and core connected on the ends. I use 50cm of this cable for the coupling loop and 2.90m for the outer loop (which is not based on any calculation but on the length I had available). I use a 350pF variable capacitor with ~540° rotation. The antenna is placed ~12m above the ground.</p>

<p>I first placed both loops as circles (see 2nd image below), pretty much as the image on G4ILO's page. I could peak the noise level on 40m and dip it but not with a satisfying SWR at all. I couldn't peak the noise level on 20m and didn't try to dip it.</p>

<p>With some experimenting, I found out that RX improved significantly when the loops touched each other as much as possible, so I experimented with an egg-shape coupling loop inside a circular outer loop. This gave somewhat better results.</p>

<p>I then kept the coupling loop somewhat circular and made the outer loop pear-shape so that it fits around the coupling loop (see 3rd picture). This allows me to peak noise level on 40m and dip it with near-1:1 SWR. The dip is rather sharp and I need to retune every ~10kHz. I can hear a fair number of stations but don't get any results on the reverse beacon network / webSDRs when I CQ myself. Normally, I get several spots on the RBN (with a 20m dipole, up ~5m).<br>
On 20m, I cannot peak noise level but I can dip to 1:1 SWR (perhaps there is so much noise on that band that the radio's AGC levels it, making it impossible to peak noise level?). The dip is much wider, I don't need to retune on 14.000 - 14.060 at all. However, also on this band no results from the RBN yet.</p>

<p>My question is twofold:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I know that a 1:1 SWR does not have to be ideal (a dummy load also has 1:1 SWR). Is there a fundamental problem with my latest construction that allows me to get a 1:1 SWR but little radiation?</p></li>

","<p>Getting this antenna to perform, as with any electrically small antenna, is a question of minimizing losses. Without being able to test your particular design it's difficult to say exactly what the losses may be, but here are some possible culprits:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dielectric and conductive losses due to coupling into the wall and things inside it. Try moving it away from the wall a bit.</li>
<li>Resistive losses in contacts. The sliding contacts in the variable capacitor are often not great. Other connections through binding posts, etc are ideally silver or gold plated, and be sure they are clean and snug.</li>
</ul>

<p>It also appears for the coupling loop you are using the center conductor of a piece of coax, whereas G4ILO uses a plain insulated wire. It should still be possible to make it work, though if your objective is to replicate a working design you should probably start by replicating it exactly before experimenting with modifications.</p>

<p>Losses can be further reduced by using large tubing, wide solid strap, soldered connections throughout, vacuum variable capacitors, etc. However, that would detract from the qualities of being small, cheap, easy to build, and portable. Any such antenna is necessarily going to compromise efficiency, but that doesn't mean it can't be efficient enough.</p>

"Can you jam jam?","206","","<p>Is it possible to jam the jammer signal, to disrupt its jamming of the owned RF signal?</p>
","<p>This would be something like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_noise_control"" rel=""nofollow"">active noise cancellation</a> and depending on the nature of the source could be somewhat possible.</p>

<p>However, it is not a trivial task.</p>

<p>If you imagine trying to cancel out an unmodulated carrier wave, with both the unwanted transmitter and a single receiver you are trying to ""unjam"" in fixed locations, you simply would need to transmit your own unmodulated carrier at some particular amplitude and phase, such that your ""unjamming"" signal and the jamming signal cancel out at the receiver.</p>

<hr>

<p>However, if the jamming signal is changing unpredictably, you'll need to be able to mimic it — only 180º out of phase — quickly enough to maintain the cancellation at the receiver.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if you are trying to ""unjam"" multiple (and perhaps mobile!) receivers the problem becomes much harder still: now you have to cause this destructive cancellation not just at a single fixed point, but at multiple points simultaneously. Sort of like causing a ""picket fence"" effect to the jamming signal, but your job is to control things so the ""dead spots"" land exactly where you want!</p>

<p>Basically you're having to design an antenna array with deep nulls in all the right places. To make matters worse, before you can drive those elements of this antenna array which <em>are</em> under your control (at least one won't be!), you're also having to reconstruct the original transmission to feed into your part.</p>

<hr>

<p>Can you do this more simply?</p>

<p>Well, if you can arrange to unjam the interfering signal directly at each receiver, you avoid the need to deal with all the ""antenna array"" stuff. But then the problem boils down to really the same thing ""noise blankers"" and ""DSP filtering"" and whatnot are trying to solve already.</p>

<p>And if you can arrange to unjam the interfering signal directly at its source, well, then… bring some wire snips?</p>

"Decoding weak APRS signals","205","","<p>I've recently started looking into APRS, and can easily receive some APRS signals from my station - however, I can't seem to decode them using QTMM or any similar software.</p>

<p>Is this because they're too weak / noisy, or am I doing something else wrong? I presume it's picking up an APRS envelope but failing a checksum or something similar - if there's any way to just get partial packet data I'd be interested in that as well.</p>
","<p>I never did manage to decode the signal reliably, which I believe to be a combination of two factors - the radio I was using was attenuating the upper frequency somewhat, and there was some additional interference in the area. APRS also uses AX25 which is hardly the most resilient protocol - at 1200baud, you get a single sine wave oscillation for each bit, so if a slight bit of noise gets in there it's easy to see how the packet can be unreadable - there's not much room for error on the physical layer. FWIW, I've also later read that QTMM isn't the best decoding tool on the block - I didn't try many others since QTMM was so simple and appeared to work for audio clips I found online, but that could be the next port of call if I were to revisit the project.</p>

<p>If they don't need a license, are there precautions or steps I should take to ensure compliance with laws and regulations during the hunt?</p>

<p>This will occur in the US, north of Line A, if that affects the answer.</p>
","<p>As discussed, yes it's perfectly legal to receive anything.  It's the transmitting that is regulated.</p>

<p>One easy solution is to not use a transceiver at all.  Since the transmitter half of the device is your problem.  So take the transmitter out of the transceiver and you end up with just a receiver.  So what can you use as a receiver?  The simplest thing to use would be a scanner!  There are many many hand held scanners that can receive things in the HAM bands and if you used one, then you don't need to worry about giving it to someone that isn't allowed to transmit.</p>

<p>You could also ""build your own"" and the good news is that building receivers is a lot less complicated and expensive than building a transmitter, and there are lots of project instructions online or even available for purchase with parts that would let you build your own for fairly cheap.

"What is the process of making a voice contact?","201","","<p>I got into Amateur Radio for emergency preparation and to allow me to expand my electronics hobby. Initially I didn't find much value in contesting or making contacts, but apparently there are some <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/questions/1000/what-skills-will-i-learn-from-contesting"">valuable skills one can gain from contesting</a>.</p>

<p>I spent some time listening to voice contacts, and the process appears to be fairly consistent, but I'm worried I might do something wrong, so before I jump in, what is the process of making a contact?  Is there a simple flowchart one might follow if exceptions happen during this process?</p>
","<p>First off, amateur radio isn't very strict. With few exceptions, nobody is going to be very upset if you miss out on something during a casual contact. If you mess up too badly, you'll be asked to provide the missing piece of information, be it a signal report, location, repeat your call sign because it couldn't be copied, or whatever the issue may be. So don't be too worried about trying and failing. I've had people copy my call sign wrong on occasion too and it isn't a big deal; just grounds for a repeat of it, is about all.</p>

<p><strong>For a non-contest (""rag-chewing"") contact, it's largely free-form.</strong></p>

<p>The first step is to announce your presence, or find someone looking to make contact themselves. On HF the standard way to do this is to call CQ (""seek you""); on repeaters practice varies, but it shouldn't be too bad calling CQ there either. You can also tail-end someone else's QSO, calling them up as they finish their contact. Don't make too long a CQ; you want to attract attention, not bore people to death before giving them a chance to respond. Even on HF SSB, a three-by-two CQ (three CQ followed by your call sign twice), possibly repeated twice, is usually plenty enough. If it doesn't attract attention you can always try again, or recognize that the frequency may be in use by a station you cannot hear. Or that simply nobody wants to talk to you, though that's quite rare. A CQ might be ""CQ, CQ, CQ, KD8OAS Kilo Delta Eight Oscar Alpha Sierra. CQ, CQ, CQ, KD8OAS Kilo Delta Eight Oscar Alpha Sierra, calling CQ and by"". Here, ""calling CQ and by"" is a fairly common shorthand for ""calling CQ and standing by for a call"". Don't rush things; someone hearing you may need to tune their antenna before they can answer, for example. Give it at least a minute or two before giving up on the frequency.</p>

<p>Something that does irk me is when people get the order of the call signs wrong. It's ""<strong>to</strong> <em>from</em> <strong>from</strong>"", not the other way around. So if you were to call CL1SGN on amateur radio, it'd be ""CL1SGN from KD8OAS"", <em>not</em> ""KD8OAS to CL1SGN"". Some people will actually go so far as to ignore a call if the call signs are given in the wrong order; and with a garbled transmission, you risk mistaking one station for the other.</p>

<p>Assuming the remote station answers your call, unless they know you from before it will usually be a pretty brief transmission just to tell you they heard you and are willing to make a contact. Technically, at this point you have established contact. At that point, you'll usually give the call sign pair again, followed by your first name and location (to whatever precision is called for). Many also give a basic equipment report stating transceiver model and antenna type and (for non-repeater contacts) mention the amount of power they are putting out. If you are able to judge it at this point, also give a RST (signal) report, then hand over to the other station with something like ""CL1SGN from KD8OAS, go ahead"", at which point the other station will generally respond with the same information. By the time they are finished, you should definitely be able to give an appropriate signal report. <em>Beyond that, the QSO may take off in almost any direction.</em> Just keep in mind the legal limits on what can be discussed over amateur radio, as well as topics that are best not discussed (politics being one of them).</p>

<p>By the time you feel happy with the contact, just courteously conclude it. This doesn't need to be very fancy at all. ""Well Jim, it's been nice talking to you. I'll be sending a QSL card via the bureau if that's fine with you. I'm OK in the call book or via the bureau. Have a good evening and maybe we'll talk again some other time. Seven-three and back to you."" There are two ways of sending QSL cards, ""via bureau"" (through the amateur radio association in your country) or ""direct"" (mailing it directly to the other station). If you want a QSL card ""direct"", be sure to say so as well as state whether (it better be!) your address is correct in the amateur radio call book. Also, don't <em>expect</em> unsolicited QSLs for contest contacts, and don't give such extraneous details during a contest contact; just send a QSL yourself and write ""PSE QSL"" (""please QSL"") on it. The remote station will likely tell you either that they don't accept QSLs via the bureau or that they are OK in the call book as well. Either way, note it in your log if you want to send a QSL card later.</p>

<p>At this point, it's pretty much up to what you want to do next. <em>As a general rule,</em> it is commonly said that the station that called CQ ""owns"" the frequency (because they were ""there"" first), and it's courteous to either disown the frequency (""you can have the frequency, Jim"") and/or state that you are going off the air (""KD8OAS going QR-tango"", for QRT meaning you are closing down your station). Remember to finish with stating both call signs involved, so that anyone listening in will know who made contact with whom.</p>

<p>Once that's all over, write down the conclusion time for the contact in your log book, grab a blank QSL card from the pile, fill it out, put a stamp on it and place it in your ""out"" pile. Then, go reward yourself with a cup of hot cocoa or whatever strikes your fancy.</p>

<p><strong>The contents of a contest contact will depend very much on the specific contest,</strong> but is generally pared down to the absolute minimum: call sign, signal report (normally a simple ""five nine"" even if the signal really isn't, to save time) and whatever the contest exchange happens to be; a locator, serial number, or something else. <em>The basic form</em> is the same, only sped up about 10× or so. During a contest, if you are holding a frequency you might not even give your own call sign more often than every half dozen contacts or so. Of course, if you are scanning across the band and working whatever stations you can find, you'll need to give your call sign each time as nobody on the particular frequency will have any idea who you are otherwise. A contest CQ is also much shorter, sometimes shortened as much as to just your own call sign once followed by the word ""contest"".</p>

"Listening below the carrier frequency gives a weaker signal than above the carrier frequency - why?","200","","<p>I have a 20m CW transceiver with an option for a wide or a narrow filter. When the narrow filter is selected, a crystal ladder filter is used in the intermediate frequency filter, between two mixers. When the wide filter is selected, this crystal filter is bypassed and there exists a direct link (that is, only a capacitor) between the two mixers.</p>

<p>I use the wide filter to search for signals by rapidly increasing frequency from 14.000MHz to 14.075MHz. When I found a good signal, I tune it to have the right pitch, and switch to the narrow filter to have less noise and other signals. </p>

<p>There are two frequencies I can tune into to find this pitch that is convenient to listen on, with a difference of about twice the pitch frequency. </p>

<p>I noticed that when I use the lower frequency, when I switch to the narrow filter, the signal is weaker than when using the higher frequency, to the point that only very clear signals can be copied. Can this be explained theoretically, and will this happen with any transceiver, or is it more likely that this is specific to this transceiver?</p>

<p>My explanation would be that the higher frequency, yielding a stronger signal on the narrow filter, is the carrier frequency. The other frequency would be the carrier minus twice the pitch frequency, which is then much weakened by the crystal filter. If the filter is bypassed though, the next mixer outputs both the sum and the complement of its inputs, so the two signals are equally strong. Is this correct?</p>

<p>The RX module is from <a href=""http://kd1jv.qrpradio.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">KD1JV</a>'s ATS 3B. I'm not sure if there's copyright on it, but the idea is quite straightforward: RF enters the first mixer, an NE602, together with the output of a DDS. Then the output of the mixer passes through the (4.9152MHz) crystal ladder filter (or not) and goes to the next mixer, a second NE602, together with the output of a controllable oscillator (with a trimmer cap), to adjust the pitch.</p>
","<p>The behavior you see is completely expected with the receiver design you describe.</p>

<p>Without either additional filtering or quadrature signals, the output of a mixer always contains both the sum and difference of the input frequencies. Therefore, the receiver you have described processes the signal as follows (all variable names are made up and probably nonstandard):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Assume there is an input signal at frequency $X$ (as well as other signals that aren't the one you're tuning to).</p></li>
<li><p>Your DDS VFO produces a reference signal at $Y$ which, when properly tuned, is approximately $X - I$ (where $I$ is the intermediate frequency of 4.9152 MHz).</p></li>
<li><p>First mixer combines these signals to $X+Y$ and $\lvert X-Y\rvert$. $X+Y$ is far out of band (~18 MHz for your description) and either there is a low-pass filter to remove it (which doesn't need to be particularly sharp) or it can just be disregarded because it won't be made audible by later stages (I'm not sure). $X-Y$ is approximately $I$.</p></li>
<li><p>Crystal filter at frequency $I$ removes everything not close to $I$, thus selecting the signal of interest $X-Y$.</p></li>
<li><p>Second oscillator (BFO) produces a reference signal at frequency $I + P$ where $P$ is the pitch you actually hear.</p></li>
<li><p>Second mixer combines these signals to $X-Y+(I+P)$ and $\lvert X-Y-(I+P)\rvert$. The first is at RF, the second is at audio frequencies, so only the second will be reproduced by the speaker.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now work out the consequences of this. Suppose you're tuned exactly on frequency: $Y = X - I$. Then the output of the second mixer is
$$
\lvert X-Y-(I+P)\rvert = \lvert X-(X-I)-(I+P)\rvert = \lvert I-(I+P)\rvert = \lvert -P\rvert = P
$$
so you hear the pitch the BFO is set for. If $Y$ is a little bit different then the pitch is a little bit different — all of these frequency changes are <em>linear</em>.</p>

<p>Suppose you're instead tuned $2P$ too low: $Y = X - I - 2P$. Then the output of the second mixer is
$$
\lvert X-Y-(I+P)\rvert = \lvert X-(X-I-2P)-(I+P)\rvert = \lvert I+2P-(I+P)\rvert = \lvert P\rvert = P
$$</p>

<p>That is, you hear the same pitch. However, since $X - Y$ is farther from $I$ in this case, the crystal filter will attenuate it much more. If the crystal filter is bypassed, this effect does not occur and the two cases are symmetric.</p>

<p>What you have can be described as a <em>double-sideband (DSB)</em> receiver, which is a SSB receiver without the filtering that selects between USB and LSB. When you add the crystal filter, it's like a lower-sideband SSB phone receiver, except that a SSB receiver would have a wider filter for the 3 kHz voice bandwidth rather than a narrow filter trying to select a single CW signal, and the VFO is calibrated so that it shows $Y \pm P$ (plus or minus depending on selected sideband) instead of $Y$.</p>

<p>If you were to tune your receiver to a SSB phone (voice) signal, then (assuming the VFO &amp; filters go that high and there's enough audio bandwidth to hear anything intelligible at all) you would hear a difference between the two frequencies: using the higher frequency (lower sideband reception), the spectrum will be reversed (garbled voice) whereas the lower frequency will preserve the spectrum and sound reasonable (if overly filtered).</p>

<p>*Now that I've got your attention, here's the theory behind it. Most consumer radios on the market are superheterodynes. In such receivers, the incoming RF signal is ""mixed"" with a sinewave coming from a tunable local oscillator (LO).</p>

<p>Mixing is basically analog multiplication, which produces, in addition to the original RF and oscillator signals, signals which are at both the sum and difference frequencies of the two. The output of the mixer is filtered to a single, fixed, ""intermediate frequency"" (IF) and then amplified. In AM (amplitude modulation) broadcast radios, which tune from 550KHz to 1600KHz, the IF is usually at 455KHz. So, by varying the frequency of the local oscillator from 1005KHz to 2055KHz, one can obtain a 455KHz difference signal from the mixer for the entire broadcast band. The output of the IF amplifier is then introduced to a ""detector"", which rectifies and low-pass filters the IF signal to produce an audio waveform.</p>

<p>A receiver similar to the superheterodyne is the direct conversion receiver. In such a receiver the ""intermediate frequency"" is zero. In other words, the LO is tuned to the exact frequency you want to listen to, and the difference signal is simply the detected audio, which can then be lowpass filtered and amplified. But there's a catch: the local oscillator must not only have the same frequency as the desired signal, it must also have the same phase. To understand this, suppose the incoming RF carrier and the LO were 90° out of phase with each other. When multiplied together, these two signals would effectively cancel each other out, and you'd hear nothing. When they're in phase, the positive swings would multiply, returning positive results, and the negative swings would multiply, also returning positive results. But getting the LO to lock onto an incoming carrier can be tricky — especially if that carrier is weak.</p>

<p>One way around this is to have two LOs, 90° out of phase with each other, and two mixers. The idea is, what one LO oscillator misses by having the wrong phase, the other will catch. In fact, the outputs from the two mixers can be combined in such a way that the actual LO phases are irrelevant, so long as they're 90° apart. The formula for doing so is:
····Audio Amplitude = sqrt(I2 + Q2),
where I is the output of one mixer (from the ""In-phase"" LO), and Q is the output of the other mixer (from the ""Quadrature-phase"" LO).
Well, that's enough theory to lay the groundwork for the Propeller receiver. I've really glossed over a lot of stuff, but this is a forum post, not a book, and I want to get to the actual hardware and software.*</p>

<p>*APPLICATION
The use of a Propeller counter as the basis for an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is now well-established. So why not simply attach an antenna to the input of one of these ADCs and see what comes out? Basically, that's what I've done. Here's a schematic:</p>

<p><a href=""http://mstram.alwaysdata.net/PropellerRadio.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">schematic http://mstram.alwaysdata.net/PropellerRadio.gif</a></p>

<p>The antenna (a wire strung across the ceiling of my shop) is connected, through an inductor to both digital ground and earth ground. I used a 330uH power inductor I found in my junkbox. It actually worked better than the ferrite antenna scavenged from a cheap transistor radio. A bunch of enameled wire wound on a plastic sewing machine bobbin worked almost as well, too. I'm sure Beau Schwabe (i.e ""He Who Understands Inductors and Knows What to Do with Them"") can shed a lot more light on the choice of inductors and why one is needed here. I just grabbed what I had until I found something that worked. My ""earth ground"" consists of the ground clip from my scope attached to the ground stud on the Demo Board. My scope input return ground and its AC protective ground are connected together, thence back to the breaker box and to a metal grounding rod. (By the way, I live in a fringe area for AM reception. If you live in a city with strong AM transmitters, you may not have to go to all this trouble.)</p>

<p>The antenna also connects, through a capacitor, to pin A3 of the Propeller. This is the ""analog"" input terminal. The feedback comes from A4 through a 470K 0805 SMD resistor, which I soldered between pins A3 and A4 right on the chip itself. I've omitted the usual filter caps to Vdd and Vss (Gnd), choosing instead to let the inherent input capacitance of A3 do the filtering. This keeps both the input impedance and frequency response of the ADC high, which is necessary for detecting weak RF signals. During positive swings of an incoming signal, A4 will be sending more 0s than 1s to counterbalance it; during negative swings, more 1s than 0s. One counter can do this, set up in the ""positive-with-feedback"" special analog mode. Unlike the usual ADC usage, though, we're never going to read this counter again. It's just that string of 1s and 0s fed back from A4 that we're interested in.
I love the Propeller's counters! I don't know if Chip knew what all could be done with them when he designed them, or if he just had an inkling that, with the right set of features, almost anything could be accomplished. In any event, the counters make ideal local oscillators and mixers! The oscillator part is pretty easy: just configure two counters as numerically-controlled oscillators (NCOs) in quadrature with each other. The frequency will be the frequency of the station you want to tune in. So, if I want to receive KIXI 880 in Seattle, I set up both counters to output 880KHz square waves, 90° out of phase with each other (i.e. PHSB = PHSA + $4000_0000).</p>

<p>Now comes the magic part: the mixers. The counters can be configured to count up whenever two inputs satisfy a Boolean conditional. The Boolean equation can be anything you want: AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, you name it. I used XOR. Each ""mixer"" counter gets two inputs: the feedback from A4 and one of the LO outputs. If the LO output is low when A4 is feeding back 1s, predominantly (i.e. when the antenna signal is low), the counter will count up at a fast clip. Likewise, if LO is high when A4 is feeding back 0s, predominantly, the counter will, again, count up at a fast clip. In other words, the counter will count up faster when an incoming RF signal is in phase with the LO than when it's not. Moreover, the rate at which it counts up will be proportional to the amplitude of that signal. So, to read the amplitude of a signal in phase with the LO, one need only zero the mixer counter, wait awhile, then read it to see how far up it counted. On average, there will be as many increments during the sample period as non-increments, so the mean (average) count will be half the number of system clocks occurring during the same period. Any signal that's out of phase with LO, or of a different frequency, will contribute as many increments as non-increments, thus having no effect on driving the net count away from the mean.</p>

<p>Therefore, after each sample period, we can subtract the actual count from the mean count to get the instaneous amplitude of the signal. By doing this for both the I mixer and Q mixer, squaring the individual amplitudes, adding them, and taking the square root, we get the signal's amplitude, which can then be fed to the audio output: another counter in DUTY mode, feeding a lowpass filter. (I used A10 on the Demo board, which has the filtering hardware already in place.)</p>

<p>The length of the sample period will affect two things: the audio frequency response and the signal-to-noise ratio. Like most things in life, each of these two desirable qualities increases at the expense of the other, so you have to strike a balance. I got the most pleasing results with a 16KHz sample rate, which yields an 8KHz audio bandwidth. This is about as good as AM radio audio can get anyway, since the stations are spaced 10KHz apart. You can lower the sampling rate to get less static, but the audio starts to sound more ""boomy"".</p>

<p>SUMMARY</p>

<p>To summarize, the receiver uses six counters (spread over four cogs), as follows: (1) ADC (actually just a digitizing RF amplifier), (2) Local Oscillators in quadrature, (2) Mixers, and (1) Audio Output
The counters do virtually all the work. There's not a lot of code required, outside of setting up the counters, reading them, and shuffling data between them via the hub. The attached program is configured as a scanner for the AM broadcast band. It increments continuously by 10KHz steps from 550KHz to 1600Khz, pausing at each frequency for three seconds, which is long enough to tell if something's there. It displays the frequency on a TV monitor, via tv_wtext (included). I've also used it for LF reception below the broadcast band with some minor success. As I stated in the intro, it's not a very good receiver — in fact it sounds pretty crappy and noisy. If, like me, you live in a fringe area, you may be disappointed by its performance. But, even then, it does illustrate the capabilities of those amazing Propeller counters. And that, really, was the main point.
-Phil</p>

<p>Update: Owing to advice received from Beau Schwabe, based on his own testing, I've changed some component values. The inductor is now 500uH; the feedback resistor, 10M; the coupling cap, 0.047uF; and the antenna, a 2-meter-long vertical wire. The attached schematic reflects these changes, which did lead to an improvement in performance.*</p>

<p>Yes, the first counter is being used as a delta-sigma modulator to turn the incoming analog signal into a high-speed string of bits. Then the counters generating the I and Q signals are defining the lower-speed sample rate. Two other counters (labeled ""mixer"") are essentially integrating (i.e., low-pass filtering) the high-speed sample data for each output sample period.</p>

<p>If the high-speed sample rate is 80 MHz, and the carrier frequency is on the order of 1 MHz, the output samples are counts in the range of 0 to 79, roughly 6 bits of resolution.</p>

<p>Since the sample rate of the output is equal to the carrier frequency, this creates a direct-conversion receiver. The sample clock serves the same function as the local oscillator in an analog receiver. In digital terms, the carrier, along with its sidebands, is being deliberately aliased down to DC, which means that the sidebands become the audio that you can hear. The low-pass filtering of the output (partly in the integrators, and partly in the analog output connection) determines the bandwidth that is being received.</p>

<p><strong>Will the impedance transformation ever make an actual mismatch “look good” (1:1 SWR)?</strong></p>
","<p>In an ideal world, if the characteristic impedance of your transmission line matches the system impedance (usually 50Ω), then adding or removing lengths of transmission line just moves the complex impedance around a constant-SWR circle. So you may get a different impedance (it may look capacitive instead of inductive, etc), but the SWR will always be the same, regardless of how much transmission line is between your meter and the antenna.</p>

<p>However, the real world is not ideal. Firstly, if the transmission line is lossy, that will make the SWR better. It does so because the transmission line absorbs some of the transmitted energy, and then absorbs again the reflected wave. No reflected wave means 1:1 SWR. Absorbing all the energy is one way to reduce the reflected wave.</p>

<p>Secondly, there are a great many amateur antenna designs which, intentionally or not, <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/q/538/218"">use the feedline as part of the antenna</a>.

When they exist, the feedline is very much part of the antenna, and changing the feedline length can change the impedance of the antenna, just like changing the length of any of the other antenna elements would. For this reason and many others, good antenna designs do not have significant common-mode currents.</p>

<p>Assume there is a licensed operator present at each station who can manually operate the transceivers, and that the operators can communicate with each other in real time (with cell phones). Additionally, the transceivers are software-defined radio devices, so it is very easy to get FFT/waterfall displays from them, as well as test with non-standard signals. However, a procedure that uses a common modulation scheme to align (e.g. narrowband FM voice) would be preferred.</p>
","<p><strong>Use a map and a compass.</strong></p>

<p>Really. It doesn't have to be more involved than that. As long as we are talking about line of sight propagation, that should be close enough to get you well within the ballpark unless this is about <em>hugely</em> directional antennas (as in, beam widths of perhaps 10° or narrower in the horizontal plane), and even if that's the case, it gets you a start.</p>

<p>Pull out a map (it can be digital or paper-based), mark the two antenna locations, and determine the magnetic bearing between them. For what can be reliably achieved on UHF, I'd probably just use a straight ruler and not worry about things like great circle propagation. Then, bring a compass to each location and aim the antennas in roughly the correct direction: as good as you can, but not fretting over half a degree. Make a test transmission, note the signal strength, adjust one of the antennas by some reasonable fraction of the beam width in either direction, try it again, rinse and repeat until you hit peak signal strength. Mark the exact antenna direction somehow in case someone bumps it, go back in and have a cup of your hot beverage of choice.</p>

<p>If you want to save time and the remote station can transmit continuously, after doing the coarse general-direction aiming you can even simply have the remote station transmit (using a fixed-power fixed-frequency mode; I would suggest a continuous carrier in CW mode, technically N0N) then gradually aim for the strongest received signal. When you are done, switch roles such that the receiving station becomes the transmitting station, and perform the process all over again. All you would need for that is a reliable means of measuring the received signal strength to sufficient precision.</p>

"Is there a difference between AFSK and FSK for AX.25/APRS USE?","195","","<p>APRS uses the AX.25 protocol which assumes the Bell 202 AFSK modulation scheme to generate the actual radio signal.  Is there any reason the same signal can't be generated directly with FSK without going through the audio frequencies?</p>

<p>My reading suggests that the advantage of AFSK is that the audio signal can be fed to any radio mike input.  But if we ignore that, and assume a transmitter where the frequency can be controlled directly, can this be done?  Would the signal be understandable to other APRS stations?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes, and it is sometimes done for APRS on HF. (This is still ""to the mike input"", but the radio is doing SSB instead of FM.)</p>

<p>From the perspective of theory of communications, this is not much different than RTTY. (However, it would be better to use a more efficient digital modulation and error-correction coding.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Would the signal be understandable to other APRS stations?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It would not be understandable to AFSK-on-FM APRS stations, because it is a different modulation.</p>

<p>Consider just one of the two tones — an unchanging tone going into a FM transmitter produces a varying frequency output. On the other end, If you attempt to receive a FSK signal with a FM receiver, you will get theoretically a square wave and likely in practice alternating polarity pulses (a high-pass-filtered square wave).</p>

<p>Can you decode that? Yes, but a standard TNC can't because it expects to do its own demodulation. (Insofar as FM and FSK are the same thing, a conventional APRS transmission is <strong>modulated twice</strong> between the bit-stream and the radio wave.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The maximum power of amateur stations shall be fixed by the administrations

<p>In my country this is 500W for CEPT License,  100W for CEPT Novice License, 1500W with additional permission (additional call sign for whoever has CEPT License) and 50W for &lt; 30MHz or 15W for > 30 MHz for automated stations. </p>

<p>Why this exact values? Why not 1 or 2 but 1,5 KW? Is there a underlying reason? Why can't i go 1 MW if i had the money? <em>And yes, i know that higher power not always means larger range.</em></p>
","<p>To add to Phil Frost's answer above, I suspect the 1.5kW number used in the US is a combination of practicality and convenience.</p>

<p>From a practicality standpoint, 1.5kW can be viewed as the point in the power to signal strength curve where your return on investment begins diminishing rapidly, at least in a hobbyist/residential scenario. To achieve a 1 S-unit improvement over a 1.5kW PEP signal, you'd need a whopping <strong>6kW</strong>. At that point you begin to tax the typical infrastructure of a residential dwelling, as a Class AB amplifier would pull a bare minimum of 12kW to develop 6kW PEP (Class AB amps are very inefficient). In the US, the average home in the 1960s had wiring that could handle 15-20 amps, but not a heck of a lot more than that, so  operating a large amplifier could pose a safety risk without special installation considerations. The grid was also not all that robust back then, so some guy constantly hammering on the grid with rapid 20kW on/off cycles is going to present technical problems for the utility company, not to mention the neighbors.</p>

<p>The necessary hardware to develop 6kW was also uncommon and very expensive back then, and even today would be cost prohibitive with modern components (enormous surplus Russian broadcast tubes excepted).</p>

<p>100-300 watts has been the ""barefoot"" standard for HF transmitters since at least the mid 1940s, primarily owing to the availability of affordable PA tubes in that range. If you're running 6kW or more, there will be such a disparity of power between you and the ""average"" ham (3+ S-units assuming identical antennas and symmetrical propagation) that you will be unable to hear many, perhaps most, of the people who can hear you. This increases the likelihood that you will unintentionally interfere with others. As your output power increases, the inevitable spurs and harmonics of your signal also increase in power, and filtering is not always a simple matter. With the current requirements for spectral purity (-50dB I believe), a 6kW amplifier could have spurs that approach 50mW PEP. On HF in good conditions, this is sufficient for reception hundreds of miles away. Achieving the -60dB or more that would be necessary to keep the HF spectrum fairly clean is not a trivial matter.</p>

<p>Finally I would posit that the precise number, 1,500 watts, was a bit of rounding for the sake of convenience. A 2 S-unit (12dB) increase above the typical 100w transmitter would be 1,<strong>600</strong> watts. To make it a nice round number that is easy to remember, 1,500 was ""close enough"".</p>

"Find RF transmission distance","194","","<p>I guess my question is as follows: if I find FSPL (there will be no buildings or anything blocking/diffracting), can I figure out how far the signal can be transmitted if the receiver gain, loss and sensitivity as well as the transmission power and gain/loss is known.</p>

<p>All I really know is the <strong>frequency</strong> of the RF (around 730 MHz), the <strong>TX Power</strong> (6dBm), the <strong>antenna gain</strong> (-21 dB), <strong>RX Sensitivity</strong>.</p>

<p>Since I cannot really find FSPL (free-space path loss) because you need the distance transmitted for that, I am kind of at a loss (no pun intended) as to how to find the possible transmitted distance.</p>

<p>So, is there a way to figure out (based on a receiver's loss/gain and sensitivity) what minimum value (I guess dBm) would be needed for a signal to be decipherable? (I have heard that 3 dB or dBm or what ever measures this is a good assumption...)</p>

<p>Also, I know <code>RX power = TX power + gains - losses</code> and FSPL is a loss (which has distance built into the formula). Since <code>**FSPL** (dB) = 20log(**distance**) + 20log(**frequency**) + 32.45</code> (for kilometers) that means that <code>distance = 10^(**FSPL** (db) - 20log(**frequency**) - 32.45)/20</code>. The problem is that there is no way to find the FSPL value in the second equation because in order to find that, you need the <em>distance</em> which is what we are trying to find in the first place!! So, you would be able to solve the initial equation (with RX power = TX power + gains - losses) equal to distance, but you would have no way of finding th FSPL value.</p>

<p>Surely if the base station ever uses 50w to reach a mobile at long range, the mobile will have no chance to transmit back.</p>

<p>I understand that on a base station receiver tech is perhaps more sophisticated / bigger and better then on a mobile unit, but why would there be such a large difference in max power? - why not limit the base stations to 5 watts or such?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Note: Only using GSM as an example, but question stands for any technology. Here is what I think I know already:</p>

<ul>
<li>Difference between a 1W mobile and 50W base station is 17 dB.</li>
<li>Base Station Diversity can add up to 5-6 dB gain, which would balance a 1W mobile to a ~4w basestation</li>
<li>MIMO is on both sides, so this would be roughly equal gain and so would probably not be relevant in this topic (although the BTS with its larger antennas + better spacing may be able to get a few more dB gain).</li>
</ul>

<p>Is the antenna technology in the base station that much better - they are larger, higher, and directional...</p>
","<p>The link is actually balanced, because the base station receiver has <em><a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antenna_diversity"">diversity gain</a></em>.</p>

<p>2G and 3G cellular systems use two antennas at the base station (for each coverage direction). They are either spaced a few metres apart, or more commonly, +45 and -45 degree polarisation, in the same housing. With two antennas and two receivers, the base station has a much greater probability of receiving the handset, above some threshold. If one antenna is in a null, the other might not be.</p>

<p>The base station also transmits from one of the antennas. Your phone doesn't have two antennas, so can't use diversity to increase its probability of receiving the signal. But the base station transmits a lot more power, and this compensates somewhat for the lack of diversity.</p>

<p>The phone is about 1W, but if it's close to the base station, it may be instructed to turn down its power, to save battery and to balance all the mobile signals at the base station receiver. </p>

<p>Diversity is related to MIMO, but is not the same thing. A diversity receiver <em>selects</em> the best signal from the two antennas. A MIMO receiver <em>combines</em> the two signals in the optimum way.</p>

<p>I've noticed that the 20m band seems to have lots of background noise everywhere in the band. The S-meter is sitting at 7 constantly. By comparison, 30m is at 5, 40m is 1, and 10m is at 1. Of course, this is connected to the same 20M antenna.</p>

<p>Is this amount of noise likely normal, or am I more likely picking up something near by that means I should change my antenna setup?</p>

<li>I'm near Saint Louis, MO. </li>
<li>Noise has been steady at this level as long as I have it connected to the antenna. No change between daytime and evening.</li>
<li>It sounds somewhat similar to static you might hear on old analog TV stations, or AM radio sets. It does <em>not</em> sound like a 60hz hum.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Resolution(ish)</strong>
- Confirmed with a local ham that when 20m is dead, he reads background noise less than S1.5 at the most with his setup.
- Powering down the entire house (all breakers off) and running the radio off the car brought noise down to S3 or so.
- Investigation in to individual breakers eventually led to my Uninterruptible Power Supply units. I have 5 in the house on 4 different circuits. Powering each one on individually incrementally increased the base noise level from S3 (all off) to S7 (all on).</p>

","<p>Make certain you have a 1:1 choking balun at the apex of your antenna. This will reduce or eliminate the possibilty of common mode currents on your feedline causing it to pickup local interference on receive.</p>

<p>Run your receiver on a battery and turn off your main breaker. Make sure any battery powered computers/tablets are fully powered off. If the noise reduces, turn off all branch breakers, turn the main breaker back on, and one by one turn on the branch breakers noting any change in noise.</p>

<p>Install an additional 1:1 balun close to your radio. This sometimes helps prevent local noise pickup on the coax outer shield.</p>

<p>Check your coax for any open or marginal connections - especially the shield connections. Try substituting other coax.</p>

<p>Eliminate any tuner, linear, SWR meters, and patch coax cables and note any change in noise levels.</p>

<p>If you have a lightning arrestor on your coax, try temporarily bypassing it.</p>

"What is an antenna tuner? Why bother with resonant antennas in the first place?","190","","<p>There are a lot of antenna tuners on the market that have various capabilities in terms of how they can allow random radiators to work with our transceivers.  </p>

<p>What exactly do they do?  My understanding is that they can neutralize the imbalance between inductive and capacitive reactance so the transceiver can couple the most power out (or in) even though an antenna might not be resonant on a particular operating frequency, since overall impedance (Z) consists of three parts, two of which are reactance dependent on frequency:  X(sub)L and X(sub)C, and R, the radiation resistance of the whole system.  And the transmitters do not work as well into a non-resistive load.</p>

<p>With a resonant antenna these are in balance such that the characteristic radiation resistance of the antenna is presented to the transmitter.  For a plain dipole that tends to be roughly 72 ohms.  And there are many antenna analyzers out there that can assist in the physical pruning of antennas in order to reduce the SWR on the feedlines.  </p>

<p>(I remember using light bulbs to tune up old tube-type transmitters because they were mostly resistive and non-reactive at HF)</p>

<p>300-ohm ladder line to a dipole requires a 4:1 balun to bring the impedance down to a range the transmitter can handle, which is typically 50-75 ohms, resistive, to keep the transmitters within their limits.  </p>

<p>So what does an antenna tuner do?  Does it reduce the SWR (loss) on the feedlines?  Or does it simply ensure a match for the transmitter so it can operate at maximum efficiency regardless of whether a signal is coupled from the antenna to the outside world?</p>

<p>To further complicate the question, there is the matter of Q - the measure of the bandwidth for which the antenna will most efficiently accept transmitter power and radiate it.  My understanding is that the best resonant antennas have a high Q which means a very narrow bandwidth for which they are most effective. </p>

<p>I've often used tuners when using 80-meter dipoles on the 75-meter phone section of the band, in order to reduce indicated SWR.  </p>

<p>Similar to using 40-meter antennas on 15 meters, though that is more problematic since the harmonics don't line up as closely and it takes a better tuner than my current travel model.  </p>

<p>So the question is in two parts:  </p>

<p>What is an antenna tuner?  If it is mounted at the transmitter is it actually tuning the antenna itself?  Does it reduce the SWR in the feedline to a non-resonant antenna, for instance?  Should the tuner be placed at the antenna instead of at the transmitter in order to reduce SWR loss (heating) in the feedline?</p>

<p>And if it is possible to use a tuner to make a transmitter feed power into a coat hanger then why do we worry about making resonant antennas in the first place?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>And if it is possible to use a tuner to make a transmitter feed power into a coat hanger then why do we worry about making resonant antennas in the first place?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a word - efficiency.</p>

<p>Consider that a full size 40 meter, 1/2 wavelength dipole is approximately 65 feet (19.8 meters) long. A dipole that is only 2 feet (0.6 meters) long, would have a gain of  only 0.5 dB less than the 65 foot dipole. This would hardly be a noticeable difference on the air. But the problem is we cannot make the <em>antenna system</em> efficient enough to realize that minor 0.5 dB loss. The system inefficiencies often result in substantial losses compared to a full size dipole.</p>

<p>But we also should not be obsessed with resonant antennas - it makes little difference with practical antennas if we properly deal with their non-resonant effects. A 10/8 wave dipole has nearly double the gain of a 1/2 wave dipole. It is not resonant but can easily be matched to a transmission line with a simple matching network. A Yagi antenna is not resonant without the addition of a matching network. Also consider that many resonant antennas are not resonant at the impedance of the feedline anyway - for example, an ideal 1/4 wave ground plane vertical is resonant at approximately 34 ohms.</p>

<p>Here are some typical sources of <em>antenna system</em> inefficiencies:</p>

<p><strong>Radiation Resistance vs Resistive Losses</strong></p>

<p>Radiation resistance is an often misunderstood and misapplied term. The radiation resistance <em>of an antenna</em> is caused by the radiation of electromagnetic waves. For a free space, 1/2 wave, center fed dipole of reasonable construction, the radiation resistance is ~73 ohms. Any resistive losses (power that is not radiated) in the antenna add to this radiation resistance to contribute to the feed point impedance. In the case of this dipole, there will be a very small amount of RF resistance due to the wires that make up the dipole. If we use 14 gauge (1.45 mm) wire to construct the antenna, the RF resistance will be ~2.7 ohms. The total feed point impedance would then be 75.7 ohms in this example.</p>

<p>The efficiency of an antenna is given by the formula:</p>

<p>$$Efficiency = \left( \frac{R_r}{R_r+R_l} \right)$$</p>

<p>where R<sub>r</sub> is the radiation resistance and R<sub>l</sub> is the resistive losses. </p>

<p>So if we apply this to our dipole example above, the efficiency would be 96.4%. By contrast, the two foot dipole will have an R<sub>r</sub> of approximately 0.04 ohms and a comparative R<sub>l</sub> of 0.08 ohms resulting in an efficiency of 33%. </p>

<p>To complete this part of the efficiency picture, consider that:</p>

<p>$$ Gain = Directivity \times Efficiency $$</p>

<p>A full size dipole has a directivity of 1.65. Multiply this times the 96.4% efficiency of the above example and the gain becomes 1.59 (2.02 dBi). For the short dipole, the directivity is 1.5. Multiply this times the 33% efficiency of the above example and the gain becomes 0.5 (-3.01 dBi). So we already have a 5 dB difference between the two antennas and there still are other <em>system</em> losses that must be taken into account.</p>

<p><strong>Matching Networks / Tuners</strong></p>

<p>In the example of our 1/2 wave dipole, the feed point impedance of the antenna is ~ 75 ohms. If we are attempting to drive this with a 50 ohm source, we may wish to have a tuner or matching network that does the transformation between the two largely resistive impedances. In this case, a well built tuner or matching network will have an efficiency in the 80-95% range (less than 1 dB of loss).</p>

<p>In the case of our short dipole example, the situation is a bit more complex. We need to both cancel the capacitive reactance of the dipole and match the very low feed point impedance. Without going through laborious calculations of matching network efficiencies, it would not be unreasonable to expect less than 10% efficiency (>10 dB loss) from the matching network. This means that at least 90% of the applied power or signal will be lost to heat in the matching network alone. Our short dipole <em>system</em> now has a gain of -13 dBi which is more than 15 dB down from our full size dipole example. This is the equivalent to comparing the signal strength of a 100 watt transmitter to a 3 watt transmitter.</p>

<p><strong>Transmission Line Loss</strong></p>

<p>All real world transmission lines exhibit loss. This in itself is a reduction in efficiency. The specification for the transmission line lists the loss for the transmission line at a given frequency assuming that the transmission line is terminated in its characteristic impedance. When the transmission line is not terminated in its characteristic impedance, the loss of the transmission line increases (the efficiency further decreases). </p>

<p>By placing a tuner or matching network close to the antenna to provide a match to the characteristic impedance of the transmission line, the additional losses due to a transmission line mismatch can be avoided. This maximizes the efficiency of a given transmission line.</p>

<p>There is a secondary effect when the transmission line is not connected to a load that matches its characteristic impedance - the transmission line will no longer exhibit its characteristic impedance. Another way of saying this is it becomes an impedance transformer. For example, our 75 ohm dipole impedance in the early example when connected to 23 feet of RG213 will be transformed to 34 ohms at the transmitter end of the transmission line. The total losses in the transmission line will be 0.119 dB, of which only 0.009 dB is due to the mismatched load. A free program such as <a href=""http://www.ac6la.com/TLDetails.zip"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">TLDetails</a> makes quick work of these calculations:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fiLqQ.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fiLqQ.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>In some cases, this transformation can be used to our advantage by transforming the antenna impedance to something that is more usable from a system efficiency perspective. In other cases, it can worsen the system efficiency. But do consider this transforming effect in light of transmitter output efficiency.</p>

<p><strong>Transmitter Output Efficiency</strong></p>

<p>The final efficiency factor to be considered is the output power of the transmitter. Most amateur transmitters are designed to deliver their rated output power when connected to a 50 ohm resistive load. Any deviation from this load will typically result in lower output power from the transmitter. This loss of transmitter output power effectively reduces the efficiency of the system. </p>

<p>For example, a 100 watt, 50 ohm source impedance transmitter that is connected to the 23 feet of RG213 that is terminated with our 75 ohm dipole, will output 96 watts (if no protection circuits kick in). This is an output efficiency of 96% (a 0.17 dB loss). Note that this is most likely more efficient, in this example, than using an antenna tuner at the transmitter to match the transmitter impedance to the feedline impedance (even though this is a 1.5:1 SWR).</p>

<p><strong>SWR</strong></p>

<p>SWR is based on the relationship of the transmission line characteristic impedance to the impedance of the load on the transmission line. In the case of a transmitting system, the load is typically the antenna. In the case of a receiving system, the load is typically the receiver input impedance.</p>

<p>Since we have already dealt with the relationship of the transmission line characteristic impedance to the load impedance in the earlier transmission line section, we need not consider SWR as another source of inefficiency.</p>

"Can I use two antennas and coax to couple RF into my aluminum sided house?","188","","<p>I have an aluminum sided house, and when I'm using my HT I typically need to be near a window for it to work well.</p>

<p>Would I gain much if I put an antenna on the roof, an antenna in the middle of my house, and connect the two using coaxial cable?  I assume it wouldn't be better than sitting myself with my HT on the roof, but will it be much better than the HT would be alone in the middle of the house?</p>

<p>I'd use antennas with matching impedance, but would probably use a very nice omni on the roof, and a smaller omnidirectional in the house. Does the type and length of coax matter very much, or can I use one I'd typically use for an antenna connected to the HT?</p>

<p>What else can I do to make this setup succeed?</p>
","<p>You could do that, but it wouldn't be terribly effective. The reason is simple: most of the power transmitted by your HT isn't directed at whatever antenna you set up.</p>

<p>You could probably do better by cutting the right sized slot in your siding. By forcing the RF currents in the siding to go around the slot, you set up an electric field which radiates as well as a dipole.

"How to learn about the physics behind propagation?","188","","<p>What are good sources for information about the propagation of RF that details the equations behind the curtain?</p>

<p>I've been able to find some simple stuff on wikipedia but nothing fancy that I'm sure exists. There's also a lack of clarity on what these formals output. </p>

<p>The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-space_path_loss#Free-space_path_loss_formula"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Free-space path loss formula</a> is a good example of this in wikipedia. </p>

<p>What does the number you get out of this mean? Is this the effective transmission power at that distance?</p>

<p>Are there any introductory sources to the papers that cover how all of this works (to the best of our current knowledge)? I'm particularly interested in:</p>

<ol>
<li>Losses</li>
<li>Refraction and reflection</li>
<li>Scattering</li>
</ol>

<p>I am not interested in approximations of the losses a link will experiance. I am interest in the way the waves will 1) move through space and get reflected off of things (the paths they take) and 2) what kind of losses these mediums and deflections introduce (the losses experianced). Equations like the Friis equation only estimate how the wave might look in total when it gets to the other station. It does not take into account many factors like solar indexes, time of day, path the radio will travel, etc.  </p>
","<p>Propagation is a very complex subject. To predict using purely mathematical means how a transmission from point A to B is more complex than trying to predict the throw of dice. There are stochastic processes, huge complexity, and many unknowns involved.</p>

<p>Simplifications must be made, and the valid simplifications depend on your objective, the frequency, and the application, among other things. If you want to understand all the physics relevant to propagation, the best I can do is refer you to many concepts to further research.</p>

<p>The most general solution is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Maxwell's equations</a>. All of the other concepts discussed here are solutions to these equations with certain assumptions added. If you want an <em>exact</em> model of how propagation occurs <em>in all conditions</em>, this is it. These equations are the foundation of classical electromagnetism, and consequently radio, optics, and electronics.</p>

<p>Of course to understand exactly the path from A to B would require a precise understanding of the geometry of everything in the path and near it, as well as the exact electromagnetic properties of every material within. That's not not realistically possible for complicated paths.</p>

<p>When the paths are simple we have things like the Friis transmission equation. All waves will be subject to this equation, though there may be other things contributing to the path effects. For things like space communications, or microwave links with nothing in the path's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_zone"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Fresnel zone</a>, the Friis equation is an accurate and precise calculation of path losses. There's very little to be understood about this model besides the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">inverse square law</a>.</p>

<p>Adding a bit of complexity, there's the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-ray_ground-reflection_model"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">two ray ground reflection model</a>. This is relevant for many VHF and microwave links where the ground will reflect the signal and create <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipath_interference"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">multipath interference</a> due to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_(wave_propagation)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">interference between the waves</a>, but with otherwise clear paths.</p>

<p>Of course multipath interference can occur due to reflections off buildings and other things. You might try to use <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(physics)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ray tracing</a> to calculate the interference, though unless the reflecting surfaces are very much larger than the wavelength, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">diffraction</a> will make this calculation inaccurate. A better calculation uses a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_field_solver"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">field solver</a> to approximate a solution to Maxwell's equations.</p>

<p>Environments often contain lossy materials, resulting in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">absorption</a>. The ground is one such common lossy material. Steel structures will incur losses due to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_hysteresis"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hysteresis</a>. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule_heating"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Resistive losses</a> also exist in metal structures, among other things. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectric_loss"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Dielectric loss</a> can occur, especially at higher frequencies. Water is a common factor in dielectric loss. At high enough frequencies, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_propagation#Absorption"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">gasses in the atmosphere can cause absorption</a>.</p>

<p>In practice, modeling the contour of the Earth, buildings, and trees in the path is infeasible, so some sort of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_propagation_model"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">propagation model</a> will be used which approximates typical environments. Often these are a combination of educated guesses about the environment's properties and empirical data.</p>

<p>Skywave propagation such as on HF is very complicated due to conditions which are constantly changing. Here again, Maxwell's equations describe the behavior, but the chaotic and complex nature of the ionosphere makes a simple solution impossible. Many topics in the field of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">optics</a> are relevant here. In practice empirical models are used, for example <a href=""http://www.voacap.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">VOACAP</a>.</p>

"What do we mean by ""RF in the shack""?","186","","<p>What does ""RF in the shack"" mean? How does it interfere with devices around coax?</p>
","<p>RF in the shack refers to the EM radiation that comes off of the outside of the conductor (usually) of coaxial cable.  Coaxial cable is actually three conductors:  center conductor, inside of the braided shield conductor, outside of the braided shield conductor.  Due to the ""skin effect"" RF currents are limited to a thin outer layer of a conductor.  This allows for the current to be separate on the inside and outside of the braided shield conductor.</p>

<p>Current on the outside of the shield can easily radiate and even act like an antenna.  Other conductors that are close to this coaxial cable in the shack are affected and you can build up a potential that results in RF ""shocks or burns"" merely by touching metal objects.  When I was a young kid back in 1961 or 1962 I had such a strong RF in the shack condition that when I keyed down I could light up the florescent lights hanging from the ceiling (my shack was in the garage).</p>

<p>This outer conductive current is known as a ""Common Mode"" current and is usually produced from an imbalance in the antenna system.  One typical imbalance is connecting coaxial cable directly to a Dipole Antenna.  A Dipole Antenna is a balanced antenna and coaxial cable is unbalanced so that results in currents flowing in Common Mode on the outside of the shield conductor.</p>

<p>The solution to resolve this problem and eliminate the common mode currents is to use a choke balun between the antenna and the coaxial cable.  Alternatively, you can use balanced transmission like, such as 450 ohm ladder line and that can attach (in the shack to a balanced load antenna tuner which then acts like a choke balun or a current balun (aka choke) which allows you to then attach coaxial line.</p>

<p>If you do use 450-ohm ladder line you will have a mismatch between the Dipole antenna and the transmission line and this mismatch results in reflections.  This is not too much of a problem in itself since ladder line is low-loss however you do have to match this to your transmitting equipment, nominally at 50 ohms, which will require a tuned circuit such as an antenna tuner or coupler circuit.  The variable control of an antenna tuner is much nicer to adjust for match at various frequencies (or, even various bands).</p>

<p>For example, I use an 80-meter dipole antenna on bands 80, 40, and 30 meters.  Most of my transmission line, about 80 feet, is 450 ohm ladder line.  Just outside of the shack it interfaces with the balanced side of a 4:1 transforming balun (from DX Engineering) and then coaxial cable (LMR400) the remaining 15 feet to my KAT500 (Elecraft) antenna tuner.</p>

<p>Common mode currents radiate so this is the cause of the primary problems  resulting in both ""RF in the shack"" but also altered radiation patterns from the interference with the antenna itself.  I have modeled this condition using NEC4 (mathematical modeling software), to observe the actual impact and in a worse case (although, with high power), it can create nulls in your radiation pattern where you don't expect them (on the broadside of a dipole antenna) in certain physical arrangements of the antenna and feed line.</p>

"What happens if a station did not submit a contest log?","184","","<p>What is the result of a contest station not submitting a log for the contest?  Are all the contacts nullified for the other stations that contacted him?  Is it bad form for a non-participating station to contact stations that are participating in a contest?</p>
","<p>In general, it is not a bad thing to work stations in a contest and not submit a log.  In the big popular contests that don't have difficult exchanges, such as the ARRL DX contest or the CQ WPX contest, the majority of participants are casual.  Casual operators are not trying to beat their buddies, or their scores from the year before; they are just there to hand out a few QSOs just for fun, and maybe pick up a new state, province, or DX entity.  The vast majority of casual entrants don't bother to submit their logs.</p>

<p>When the time comes to judge the contest, the scoring ""robot"" (computer program) must judge whether a given contact was completed accurately.  If both stations submitted their logs, and the call signs, frequencies, and times match, and the exchanges sent match the exchanges received, then the contact is considered good (assuming that suspicious behavior patterns that might indicate possible cheating are absent).</p>

<p>Things get more complicated for the scoring robot if only one station has logged the QSO.  The robot then looks to see if any other stations logged that station at the same frequency and time.  Often, the call sign has been miscopied; if W1ABC logged VE2XYZ, but VE2XYY submitted a log claiming a QSO at that time with W1ABC, then W1ABC will probably be judged to have made a mistake copying VE2XYY's call sign.</p>

<p>Consider the situation in which several stations log a particular call sign, for example K9EFG.  If eight stations reported working K9EFG, but K9EFG didn't submit a log, the most likely reason is that K9EFG worked several stations but didn't submit a log.  Almost all contest robots will give the eight stations the points for having worked K9EFG.</p>

<p>Most of the big prestigious contests email reports to stations that submitted logs after the contest has been scored.  The reports give the station's final score, but also an explanation of points that were subtracted for mistakes, and often even a report of stations that miscopied the station's call sign or exchange.  These reports make excellent feedback, letting the operators know exactly what mistakes they made.  CQ Magazine call their report the ""UBN"" report, for Unique stations, Bad call signs, and Not-in-log reports.  Of those three situations, a bad call sign or a not-in-log will definitely cost points.</p>

<p>But then there is the interesting situation in which a station logs a particular station that no other station logged; a ""Unique"" in the CQ Magazine UBN report.  That could be caused by a casual contester making only one QSO, or it could be caused by the operator getting a call sign wrong.  Most contest robots will give the operator the benefit of the doubt for a unique call sign, but it does look somewhat suspicious, which is why it is flagged in the UBN report.</p>

<p>My personal contest etiquette recommendation for casual contesters is to try and work at least two or three stations, so that your call sign won't be unique.  But if you should make a single QSO and then be called away from the shack, don't worry about it; stations actively participating in the contest want your QSO, and are willing to accept the inevitable ""uniques"" in the UBN report to make QSOs.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you make just a few QSOs in a contest and you are using contest logging software, then I recommend that you submit a log, for two reasons: first, it helps the contest organizers score the contest more accurately, and second, for major contests you will receive the report giving excellent feedback on where improvement is needed.  Most contests give the option to submit a log as a ""check log"", which is used to check the accuracy of other logs, but does not get scored for points.  So if you might submit a log but don't want to be embarrassed by being listed near the bottom of the results, then submit your log as a check log.  I don't think stations that submit check logs get feedback reports though.</p>

"Bonding of Coax shield to RF ground conductor for long ground runs?","183","","<p>My shack is on the second floor of my home, and I run a single operator, 2 radio contest setup. The two coax runs pass through the wall and drop down to an antenna switch approximately 15 feet from the radios.</p>

<p>The ground system consists of multiple copper ground rods driven in over a fairly wide area, bonded together with 4awg bare copper wire, and the ground then travels up the exterior of the house to the shack via a 1"" wide copper braid, also about 15 feet long in total.</p>

<p>The coax shields are grounded to the same ground stakes that the antenna switch is grounded to, and there are polyphaser lightning arrestors located at the ground stakes.</p>

<p>K9YC and W8JI both recommend installing common mode chokes as close to the radio as possible, and connected to a low impedance ground line to prevent high power common mode signals from efficiently coupling to nearby electronics. I intend to do so using 1:1 common mode chokes right at the radio coax connector, bonded to the ground line, but neither mention bonding feed line runs together.</p>

<p>I'm trying to determine if there would be any advantage or disadvantage to bonding the shields of both coax runs and the ground line together at the bulkhead panel. On the one hand, this would reduce overall impedance of the ground connection, but on the other, it may provide a route that common mode current appearing on one conductor could bleed over on to the other conductors.</p>

<p>I will likely also include common mode suppression within the antenna switch itself, so the line should be fairly well isolated on both ends.</p>

<p>Should I use the bulkhead connectors and bond the lines together at the pass through plate (some 6 feet from the radios and 10 feet from earth), or use grommets to protect the coax as it passes through the hole in the aluminum panel, and bond the coax shield to the ground line only at the radio chassis and the antenna switch?</p>
","<p>Bond it all together. At both ends, if you can. Effective lighting protection isn't really just about providing a path to ground, though that's part of it. More importantly, <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/q/51/218"">lightning protection</a> is about having ""ground"" at just one point so ""ground over here"" can't be 200V different from ""ground over there"". This is what you get, for example, when your radio is plugged into a normal AC outlet which goes to the ground at the electrical panel (ground #1), while also being plugged into the antenna (ground #2).</p>

<p>The more effectively you bond all the grounds together, the less potential difference can develop between them, providing better protection. The lightning protector is just there to temporarily ground thing which can not be grounded (like the coax center conductor) in the case of a strike.</p>

<p>Bonding the grounds together isn't going to make common mode issues any worse, and if anything will make them better. In fact common mode currents will flow over all your cables whether you connect them or not: that they run parallel means they are inductively and capacitively coupled and so the RF current will ""jump"" across them even if they aren't connected at DC. This is why for example common mode currents always end up on the outside of coax, even if you try to drive the current on the center.</p>

<p>And if your common-mode currents are due to something like driving a vertical without a sufficient ground plane, then those common mode currents want to get to ground to match the current in the vertical. Providing a lower impedance path to ground will thus improve things.</p>

<p>I would like to be able to guess where man-made signals (i.e. channels) exist in this spectrum (as opposed to noise floor).  This is proving to be a difficult task, especially since the noise-floor power sometimes changes (different antenna inputs for different bands, for example.)</p>

"How are multiple-operator contest stations with one radio usually operated?","181","","<p>I am the president of a small school club. We plan an participating in the ARRL SSB Sweepstakes this weekend, which is our (new) club's first real multi-op contest effort.</p>

<p>How do multioperator/club contest stations with only one transceiver usually operate? Is it common practice to have one person handling the radio while having another logs? I was thinking of setting up some parts of the contest up like that.</p>
","<p>My advice won't necessarily be good for a competitive score, but here is what I've found from running a school Club station during Sweepstakes. </p>

<p>The main thing is to have fun! Don't take it too seriously if it's your (or anyone that's operating) first time contesting. </p>

<p>For running multi op, it really depends on how many people you have and their experience level and time availability. </p>

<p>If you have people who are completely new, then it usually helps to have two pairs of ears listening with one person operating while the other logs the contacts. Two people at the radio means that there is a double check on the exchange, and that it's easy to swap positions for a break. </p>

<p>That being said, it isn't that hard to log and operate at the same time. I prefer working alone, and use the multi op to avoid spending a whole day in the station. </p>

"How to choose a coaxial cable","181","","<p>How do you know which coaxial cable to choose for your application? </p>

<p>For instance;
I require a cable that has a 50ohm impedance, an operating frequency of 2.4GHz, length of 100mm, and needs to be semi rigid to support the elements of the antenna I am going to make. 
Requires a RP-SMA connector.</p>

<p>The antenna is going to be used on a video transmitter if that is of importance</p>

<p>What would be a suitable cable and why?</p>

<p>Previously I have used RG316 then gained rigidity with wire strapped to the outer. </p>
","<p>Your primary concerns are likely to contain:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Characteristic impedance ($Z_0$). This is usually dictated by the other components in your system and is usually $50\Omega$ for amateur radio applications. $75\Omega$ components are also not difficult to find due to their widespread application in TV. </p></li>
<li><p>Loss. At a given frequency, a given cable will have some loss figure, usually given in units of decibels per unit length. Losses increase with frequency, so a cable that might work fine at 960 kHz wouldn't be much more than a heater at microwave frequencies. Because loss is proportionate to length, at shorter lengths a lossier cable may be more acceptable.</p></li>
<li><p>Power handling. Several things limit this. One is loss as above: losses become heat, and excessive heat will damage the cable. The cable must also be able to withstand the voltages associated with the power without suffering dielectric breakdown.</p></li>
<li><p>Physical characteristics. Do you need a cable rated for direct burial? UV exposure? If you need a tight bend radius, you probably need a smaller diameter cable. Flexible or rigid? Will the cable need to withstand repeated bending from handling, or is it in a permanent installation? Will people potentially step on the cable? Compatibility with connectors can be a concern: clearly you will not be attaching an SMA connector directly to a 2-inch hardline. Fortunately, coax cables tend towards standard dimensions and thus compatibility with connectors is usually not difficult. For example, there are many cables that have the same physical dimensions as, and accept the same connectors as RG-58.</p></li>
<li><p>Cost. The materials and manufacturing techniques used to achieve any of these desirable properties cost something. A good engineer is one that selects the cheapest solution which performs acceptably.</p></li>
<li><p>Availability. Can you buy it at the electronics store at the corner, or must it be ordered? Is it in stock? Is it sold by the foot or by the spool?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>With these concerns in mind, decide which are most important for your application, then browse distributor and manufacturer catalogs until you find something acceptable. The catalog will specify a few key parameters such as loss at a couple frequencies, basic construction, cost, and size. Pick a few candidates and then read the datasheets, which specify all the parameters in much more detail. Frequently they will also contain helpful information such as compatible connectors, applications to which the cable is especially well suited, etc. Then make your choice.</p>

"SSB modulation image rejection","181","","<p>I'm trying to figure out how SSB transmitters manage to get rid of the images created when mixing up audio frequencies. For example, when mixing a 1KHz signal with a 7MHz one you will end up with two signals, one at 7.001Mhz and one at 6.999Mhz. Creating a filter with such a narrow cutoff sounds infeasible so how is it done?</p>
","<p>Well, there are two relatively simple methods and one slightly more complicated.</p>

<p>In the analog world, SSB signals are created in two ways: The filter method and and phasing method. </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>The filter method</strong> does just what you suggested - a very selective
filter eliminates one sideband. Using piezoelectric crystals, filters
can be made what can do that. Mostly between 4 and 12 MHz, combining
crystals can form a nice filter that just passes the audio band (or
so). As the frequency of the crystal filter is not easy to change, this is done at a fixed frequency (frequently 9 MHz) and the resulting SSB signal is then mixed up or down.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The phasing method</strong> is more difficult to explain, and needs some math to do it properly. Basically, both the RF and the audio signal are split into two parts, which are 90 degrees out-of-phase. Then one of the audio signals is modulated onto one of the RF signals to produce DSB (Double sideband). Same for the other audio/RD pair. Adding the two will eliminate one of the sidebands (subtracting eliminates the other one :)</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The more complicated way</strong>, and which needs a fast processor, implements the phasing method purely by algorithms with both signals converted to digital. The phase shifting of the audio is accomplished with an algorithm called the Hilbert Transform, which creates two output signals with 90° phase shift.</p>

<p>The graphics are not too good here:

<blockquote>
  <p>Q. What is considered a generally inactive licensee? </p>
  
  <p>A. The GOTA station is not for everyone. The generally inactive licensee provisions pertain to someone who holds an amateur that 
  has been inactive for a significant period of time. The intent and the spirit of this station is to provide an opportunity for persons to 
  gain on-the-air experience and progress to operating the regular club stations in the future. The intent is not to develop a group of 
  “permanent GOTA Field Day operators”. This is also not a station that a club “ringer” operates in order to rack up points. <strong><em>The list 
  of operators of this station must be submitted with the Field Day entry.</em></strong></p>
  
  <p>In order to claim the GOTA bonus, the club/group must provide a list of operators and the number of QSOs each operator makes at 
  the GOTA station. <strong><em>Clubs should use their best judgment in determining the operators of the GOTA station.</em></strong> </p>

"Power dissipation in transmission lines?","180","","<p>I was wondering, does the impedance of a transmission line have any effect on the power it dissipates? I'm familiar with the fact that an impedance equal to the load will provide maximum power transfer (and dissipate just as much power as the load) but guess that's of no bearing when talking about transmission lines? If a line is rated as 50 Ohm, does it have any impact on power dissipation?</p>
","<p>No. The cause of power loss in a feed line is not due to the characteristic impedance, it actually varies among transmission lines of the same impedance. Otherwise all 50 ohm coax would be the same - but there are many different types and qualities of cable. The actual loss is measured not in ohms but in decibels per foot, and varies with both the type of cable and the frequency in use (with higher frequencies having greater loss, due to skin effect). If you need to get the loss of a particular cable, or compare two cables, you should get a chart or table from the manufacturer. <a href=""http://www.w4rp.com/ref/coax.html"" rel=""nofollow"">This table</a> lists some common types of coax at a variety of frequencies.</p>

<p>The 50 ohm value being described is not the impedance of a circuit element, which is a word for the complex form of resistance. It has a 50 ohm characteristic impedance. It's still the ratio of the voltage to the current, but in this case of a wave travelling down the core and back along the shield. It's a property of how the line behaves in response to a wave travelling through it, and it's important because if it doesn't match at any given connection, since current coming in must equal current coming out and that means the two sides would have different voltages, part of the wave is reflected to allow everything to even out. However even though it's measured in ohms, it is not related to resistive loss.</p>

","<p>This is standard NMEA data format.  The GPS is configured to provide the following NMEA strings:</p>

<li>GPGSA, Dilution of precision and active satellites</li>
<li>GPRMC, Recommended minimum data: position, velocity, vector, time</li>

<p>You'll notice much of the information is redundant, time occurs in many sentences, so does position. The original design of the NMEA communications standard allowed many devices to connect to one common data bus and listen only for those sentences they need, and provide only those sentences they had available.  Some devices didn't calculate vector and velocity, so never provided more than the <code>GGA</code> and <code>GSA</code> sentences.  Now almost all GPS units deliver most of the possible GPS sentences, but they are configurable so you can turn some sentences on or off depending on your needs.</p>

<p>The essential NMEA API is sentence based.  The $ starts a sentence, and the *xx ends it, with xx being a checksum. Each device has a two letter prefix, <code>GP</code> for GPS units, and a three letter suffix for the sentence type.  There are further interesting things about the standard, but they are not necessary to understand your data.

"Can you place reflective material near to an antenna without interfering with the radiation pattern?","178","","<p>So I'm trying to understand how radiation pattern are calculated and it's going well (so far!). I've come across a bit of an issue when it comes to the following situation:</p>

<p>If we have a omnidirectional antenna and then place some reflective material collinear with the direction of the radiation (so if the antenna was a flag pole, the material could be like a flag) does the reflective material interfere with the radiated signal?</p>

<p>Now intuitively I would say no, since the material is collinear with the radiation then it can not reflect the radiation in any way, I understand that the material couldn't be infinitely thin so there would be a small section of reflected/absorbed radiation, but that would be pretty tiny.</p>

<p>So where am I going wrong in my understanding here? I've found another forum where someone says this isn't how it works, but not why.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>If the only thing the material did was ""reflect"", and it was like a flag on a vertical antenna, then I guess it wouldn't have any effect on the radiation pattern.</p>

<p>The problem is that no such material exists.</p>

<p>One problem is that for a material to ""reflect"", it has to be many (at least 10, say) wavelengths long. Any less than this, and effects like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction"" rel=""nofollow"">diffraction</a> will be significant, and so the material won't behave very much like an ideal reflector. There are ""reflectors"" that are less than many wavelengths long, such as the elements of a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yagi-Uda_antenna"" rel=""nofollow"">Yagi antenna</a>, but these work by being tuned to very specific sizes, and that's probably not what you had in mind.</p>

<p>Another problem is that any material that you might consider for this purpose (like metal), will have <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistivity_and_conductivity"" rel=""nofollow"">conductivity</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permeability_(electromagnetism)"" rel=""nofollow"">permeability</a> significantly different than that of air. The electromagnetic radiation an antenna produces is the result of mutually perpendicular electric ($\vec E$) and magnetic ($\vec B$) fields. In the case of a vertical antenna, the electric field is vertical, and the magnetic field horizontal, concentric with the antenna:</p>

<p>Were you to put a metal ""flag"" on this antenna, it would be coplanar with the electric field. Metals are very conductive (that's what gives them their shiny appearance), and so they will have a very significant effect on that electric field, which in turn affects the radiation pattern.</p>

<p>Put more generally, your line of thought seems to be based on reasoning that works with mirrors and visible light. But even though visible light and radio waves are electromagnetic radiation which differ only in wavelength, this turns out to be very significant. Visible light has a wavelength on the order of 500 nm, whereas the radiation from a 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi has a wavelength of approximately 125,000,000 nm, or approximately 250 thousand times bigger. If you could make your bathroom mirror 250 thousand times smaller you'd find intuition breaks down, and you will start seeing effects not usually seen in everyday life simply because they are so small.</p>

","<p>So what you have is binding posts (I assume) with a specified 75 Ω input. That's unusual, but let's run with it.</p>

<p>First of all, you <em>can</em> use a 75-300 Ω “matching transformer” that has the right ends, and it will probably work just fine (reception does not care very much about impedance mismatches), but it's not the way to get the absolute best performance.</p>

<p>Instead, what you want to do is to connect the 75 Ω cable <em>directly</em> with no transformer. You can make an adapter without needing to buy any specialized parts or solder anything:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Find a friend who's throwing out some coax, or ask a cable TV installer for scraps, or worst case go buy from the hardware store:</p>

<ul>
<li>a standard 75 Ω ""F"" connector coaxial cable, as short as you can find.</li>
<li>a ""F"" coupler (as you would use to connect two cables).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Cut the cable, so you have a short piece with a connector on one end.</p></li>
<li>Using a knife, wire stripper, or a coax stripping tool if you have one, carefully strip off the outermost insulation for an inch or so, revealing the braid (outer conductor).</li>
<li><p>Unbraid the braid, then bundle the fine wires off to one side (so that they are not surrounding the center conductor any more) and lightly twist them together like they were a piece of stranded wire, for later convenience.</p></li>
<li><p>Strip off the dielectric (insulation) around the center conductor, but not so far back it'll short against the shield.</p></li>
<li>Use the coupler to attach this to the end of your antenna cable.</li>
<li><p>Connect the shield wire to the ""GND"" binding post and the center wire to the ""FM ANT"" binding post. Make sure no stray wires from the shield are shorting.</p>

<p>(Make sure they're not pulled down to short against each other by the weight of the coax — perhaps an adhesive cable clamp stuck onto the case over in the free space to the right would help as strain relief.)</p></li>

"How does FM encode BOTH amplitude and frequencies of full audio signal spectrum?","178","","<p>How does frequency modulation encode both amplitude and frequency of the modulating audio signal only by varying frequency? How do both components get spread across and encoded in the side bands? I generally understand that AM side bands occupy sufficiently wide band width to recreate the spectrum of the modulating audio signal (while varying amplitude at each frequency in the spectrum of the sound wave)--so the spectrum of a side band should look basically like the spectrum of the underlying modulating audio wave. Is this understanding wrong?</p>

<p>My understanding is that FM modulates the instantaneous frequency of the carrier signal according to the amplitude of the modulating signal, but the modulating audio signal should be made up of a wide spectrum of frequencies at various amplitudes that make up the underlying sound. So the carrier can only be modulated with a single frequency of varying amplitude. What about the other frequencies in the audio signal spectrum? Is this information spread out across the side bands somehow? If so, how?</p>

<p>(I am studying for my technician license; I don't know Fourier math.)</p>
","<p>Whatever modulation we use, there's a baseband signal we wish to transmit (music, voice recording, whatever), which somehow modulates a carrier to produce the output signal.</p>

<p>Your question suggests you are primarily concerned about how the frequency domain representation of the baseband translates to the frequency domain of the output. This is a valid thing to wonder, and it has particular relevance to determining how much bandwidth will be occupied by the transmission for a given input, for example. But it's not always the best way to understand a modulation scheme. That's better done in the time domain.</p>

<p>For AM, we modulate the amplitude of that signal. Let's say the baseband signal is a square wave. Here's an example of a ""loud"" square wave and AM, with the baseband in red, and the output in blue.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4EDAV.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4EDAV.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>With a quieter baseband input, the variation in amplitude of the output is less.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/b6Ewi.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/b6Ewi.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>For FM, we modify the frequency instead of the amplitude. Here again is a loud square wave. Note the large variation in frequency between the periods where the square wave is a large value, versus where it's a low value:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FTXO2.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FTXO2.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>With a quieter baseband input, the variation in frequency is less:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QVM3V.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QVM3V.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Of course in practice the baseband signal will be something more interesting than a square wave. Here's an AM example with a more complex input:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gd8cW.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gd8cW.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Note the baseband waveform can be anything at all: it can have any number of frequency components, at any number of amplitudes. But that's not necessarily relevant: all we need to know at any instant is the value of the baseband signal, and that's what the amplitude of the carrier is.</p>

<p>And now with FM:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PqYqq.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PqYqq.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>What does FM look like in the frequency domain? Let's generate some waterfall plots with a sine wave baseband which changes only in frequency or amplitude.</p>

<p>Altering the baseband amplitude increases the amplitude of the FM sidebands. Here's a sine wave baseband, increasing in amplitude.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0014M.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0014M.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Increasing the baseband amplitude is equivalent to increasing the modulation index or deviation. You can see that even with just a sine wave baseband, there are several sidebands generated. Mathematically, these repeat out to infinity, but in practice they can be ignored at some point. A typical modulation index will be such that there are at least a few sidebands, otherwise most of the power would be in the carrier, making inefficient use of transmitter power.</p>

<p>Altering the baseband frequency changes the spacing between the sidebands. Here's a sine wave input of constant amplitude, increasing in frequency:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qe6ef.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qe6ef.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Of course in practice baseband will contain many frequency components, varying in amplitude. Because even a single baseband frequency generates several sidebands, the individual frequencies in baseband create overlapping output frequencies and the result is a jumbled mess, visually.</p>

","<p>In your particular case, I'd note 2 things:</p>

<ol>
<li>The aluminium is directly above the whip, where the antenna's fields are the weakest.</li>
<li>Aluminium is a good conductor, so unless there is something about it that will increases losses, it won't decrease the radiated energy. It might change the feedpoint impedance, and it might change the direction in which energy is radiated, but the antenna efficiency must remain the same because there are no significant losses to account for the difference.</li>
</ol>

<p>My advice would be to not worry about it too much. Probably the effect is small.</p>

<p>A more general rule of thumb:</p>

<ul>
<li>anything 10 wavelengths or more away from the antenna is insignificant to the near-field operation of the antenna. It might have other effects by reflecting or redirecting the energy, but then the receiver could be in a Faraday cage too.</li>
<li>at 2 wavelengths, things are somewhat significant.</li>
<li>below 1 wavelength, things are very significant.</li>
</ul>

This in turn reduces noise in environments heavy in electrostatic noise, the argument goes.</p>

<p>Is this physically possible? Can a shield block time-varying electric fields while allowing time-varying magnetic fields to pass unchanged?</p>
","<p>No, it's not possible. Anything that is good at blocking time-varying electric fields will also be good at blocking time-varying magnetic fields of a similar frequency.</p>

<p>First let's consider a vertically polarized, radiated wave incident upon a conductive plane:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/A2Ws5.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Since this wave is vertically polarized, the electric field vector points alternatively up and down. Because it's a radiated wave, it's also accompanied by a magnetic wave, in phase, but horizontal.</p>

<p>The varying electric field will pull the charge carriers in the conductive plane up and down, along with the field. Assuming an infinite, perfectly conductive plane, the electric field won't penetrate the plane at all, because the charges in the plane rearrange themselves to cancel the electric field. This is the principle behind a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_cage"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Faraday cage</a>.</p>

<p>But wait...the charges in the plane are moving with the field. That's a current, right? And when there's a current in a conductor, there's an associated magnetic field, right? The current is vertical, and the magnetic field is concentric with the current, so it will be in the horizontal plane. So is the magnetic field associated with the electric field incident upon the plane.</p>

<p>If you <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">do the math</a>, as it turns out, these magnetic fields cancel.</p>

<p>OK, but what if it isn't a radiated wave, but just a magnetic wave incident upon the plane? Maybe there is a solenoid nearby, which we are driving with an alternating current. Will the plane block that?</p>

<p>Yes, it will. The time-varying magnetic field will induce <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_current"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">eddy currents</a> in the plane which cancel the magnetic field. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday%27s_law_of_induction"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Faraday's law of induction</a> explains these eddy currents. It is this very same effect that is responsible for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_effect"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">skin effect</a>.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.w8ji.com/skindepth.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">W8JI has a good experimental demonstration of this</a>. He puts a connector in a copper sheet and drives it with a signal generator. He then probes the electric and magnetic fields at increasing distances on the front and then around the back of the sheet. For both the electric and magnetic fields, the field weakens with increasing distance, and by the time he gets around to the back of the sheet, directly behind the connector, neither the electric nor magnetic fields are measurable.</p>

<p>This seems odd, because a sheet of copper has no particularly obvious magnetic properties, and classically we think of separate magnetic forces and electric forces. How can a copper sheet have any effect on the magnetic force? When Maxwell made his equations, he didn't know either: it was just experimentally found to be true.</p>

<p>The development of special relativity provided more insight. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TKSfAkWWN0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The magnetic force is really just the consequence of special relativity and the electric force in a moving frame of reference</a>. So you see, there really isn't a magnetic force. There's only an electric force, and special relativity.

"Does the waveform of the VFO necessarily have to be sinusoidal?","175","","<p>Looking around for a VFO online, I see most kits/manufacturers make it a point to mention the waveform. Sinusoidal is a fundamental shape, whereas others (sawtooth, square) are a composite. </p>

<ul>
<li>Does the VFO signal necessarily have to be a sinusoid? </li>
<li>Does the remark about a VFO with a composite signal ring true?</li>

","<blockquote>
  <p>Does the VFO signal necessarily have to be a sinusoid?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely not. For each frequency component on a mixer's inputs, it produces at the output the sum and difference of those frequency components. Of course, if one of the inputs is sinusoidal, then it has just one frequency component. However, if there are more frequency components it still works.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Does the remark about a VFO with a composite signal ring true?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Fourier"" rel=""nofollow"">Joseph Fourier</a> proved that any periodic function can be decomposed into a (possibly infinite) number of sinusoidal components, each with some amplitude and phase.</p>

<p>For example, a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_wave"" rel=""nofollow"">square wave</a> consists of some fundamental frequency, plus all its odd harmonics. A <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sawtooth_wave"" rel=""nofollow"">sawtooth wave</a> has even and odd harmonics. Each of these harmonics will generate mixing products, just as if you fed in a sine wave at that harmonic frequency. This can be used to an advantage in some designs, as long as the filtering is such that the mixing products from the other harmonics don't cause issues.</p>

"How do you keep your vehicle clean with a mobile antenna?","170","","<p>I want to add a V/U antenna to my truck, but my wife started asking about weather proofing and car washes and I had no answer. How do you keep your vehicle clean after installing a new antenna, and how do I keep rain and snow and road debris out of the electrical connections?</p>

<p>My plan was a pickup bed post hole mount on the driver's side, 40"" antenna so it would only be about 6 inches taller overall than it is now with the stock radio antenna. </p>
","<p>If you are washing your vehicle by hand or at a “touchless” automatic wash then there should be no need to do anything with an antenna that does not stick out excessively; weatherproofing should be part of proper mounting.</p>

<p>If you need to take down the antenna, then how you do it will depend on the exact construction of your antenna and mount. If you're using an antenna which mounts to a 3/8""-24 stud, for example, then you can just remove the antenna, wash, and reinstall (after drying the joint). Even if the antenna is a type with a coaxial mount (e.g. NMO, PL-259) then there is a good chance there is some way to unscrew the whip portion.</p>

<p>However, you should be careful about leaving exposed any type of coaxial connection (as opposed to a stud or threaded hole). Unless specified otherwise, you should <strong>not</strong> assume that the insulator between the center and shield is weatherproof, and if it gets wet it may carry water into the coaxial cable which causes permanent damage.</p>

<p>If you can easily remove the entire mount with all connections intact, then you could just lay it down in your truck bed.</p>

<hr>

<p>You will likely have an exposed coaxial connector between your mount and the feed line to your radio. This connection does need to be weatherproofed in most cases. (N connectors are designed to be weatherproof, but I would not rely solely on that.)</p>

<p>There is a specific type of tape which you use for this purpose — called variously “rubber tape”, “self-fusing tape”, “amalgamating tape”, “Coax Seal” (that being a brand name). It has the property of fusing to itself when stretched and pressed together, so that after application you do not have just layers of tape stuck together with adhesive, but rather a tightly fitting custom rubber boot, and when cut off afterward it leaves no residue and a pristine unweathered surface.</p>

"Why are PL tones strange numbers?","170","","<p>PL tones have very specific odd numbers with a decimal place like 103.5 or 107.2 or 88.5. The only PL tone that does not have this decimal is the 100.0 hertz tone. </p>

<p>Why don't they just use integers with a standard increment of lets say 10 hertz so it would just be 100, 110, 120 etc. instead of the random numbers?</p>
","<p>Greg Hewgill's answer is correct, but merits a slight explanation.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Constant (percentual) relations mean that the Q-factor of the detector for the tones remains constant. Most detector chips (like the old NE567) and algorithms are designed for a single Q, and the frequency changes don't change the Q.</p></li>
<li><p>Distortion is quite normal in electronics — low tones like these are no exception. In fact, they are more sensitive than others as the audio channel was designed for higher (voice) frequencies. A side effect of distortion is what is called <em>intermodulation</em>: new frequencies being generated by the presence of two (or more) other signals.</p>

<p>For example, if the subtones were 100, 105 and 110 Hz, then the second harmonic of 105 (210) minus the first (100Hz) could conceivably generate a difference of 210 &minus; 100 = 110 Hz, which would be the next subtone, and could possibly trigger some detector. This cannot happen with the actual tone.</p></li>
<li><p>You may have noticed that the DTMF basic tones are <em>also</em> organized in a similar way — for the same reasons. In fact, the musical notes on any instrument are like this, because our ears discern differences in a similar way to detectors — constant Q.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I am not sure why the separation was chosen to be 1.035, but the exceptions are very probably because the tones which are near multiples of 60 and 50 Hz are shunned because of mains frequency interference, which can filter into the signal via power supply issues/microphone cables, etc.</p>

<p>No more than your TV, electric lights, or phone charger. In fact, quite possibly less. Certainly far less than your cell phone, laptop, or Xbox controller, all of which contain intentional transmitters.</p>

<p>A scanner does not emit anything intentionally because it does not transmit. There are, of course, <em>unintended</em> emissions, but then this is true of any electrical device. It is especially true of modern, high speed digital electronics.</p>

<p>Most jurisdictions have some authority which limits the maximum permissible unintended emissions for devices. For example, in the USA this is the FCC. To sell a product, a manufacturer must submit a prototype to an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_compatibility#EMC_testing"" rel=""nofollow"">electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing facility</a> which measures the very small, unintended emissions of the product. The results are sent to the FCC which must certify the device before it can be sold.</p>

"Resistive impedance with frequency","168","","<p>Full disclosure, I'm a little dyslexic.
Concepts that are easy to most people usually seem ambiguous to me. 
I also have a had time expressing myself through writ so please
forgive me if this seems like an odd question.</p>

<p>I've been reading my ARRL hand book and many items on the internet
in an attempt to form a good working understanding of antennas.
I think I may have finally grasped it but I want to check it against a human
who can give me and clear answer.</p>

<p>I'll post a hypothetical:</p>

<p>Say I have a stationary dipole and my antenna analyzer gives me a reading
of 100 +j12 Ω at it's resonant frequency.
I want to match it to my 50Ω unbalanced feed line so I place both a
capacitor that gives -j12Ω at the resonant frequency, and a 1:2 balun at the
feed point.<br>
Now lets say I want to go off the resonant frequency, this will change the reactive component of the impedance and my conjugate -j12Ω will no longer perfectly match the antenna. But, will the 1:2 balun still correct for the 
resistive portion of the impedance just as it did at resonance?</p>

<p>I think what I'm trying to ask is, will the resistive impedance change with frequency as the reactive impedance does? That seems like such a simple question
but I have not been able to find a clear answer to it which leads me to believe It's a bad or meaningless question like ""whats the color of the number two"".
I honestly can't tell.</p>

<p>.</p>
","<p>If you antenna were actually a <em>resistance</em>, then the impedance would not change with frequency. Resistance is anything that obeys Ohm's law:</p>

<p>$$ V = I R $$</p>

<p>A real example that you may encounter is a dummy load. These are just a $50\Omega$ resistor, which provides a $(50 + 0j)\Omega$ over a broad range of frequencies (ideally, all frequencies).</p>

<p>Antennas are not just a simple resistance. Rather, they are a complex impedance. Antennas are complex to analyze, so let's first consider a simpler circuit, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LC_circuit"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">LC circuit</a>. Here's one such circuit:</p>



<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7xBYG.png"" alt=""schematic""></p>



<p><sup><a href=""/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2f7xBYG.png"">simulate this circuit</a> &ndash; Schematic created using <a href=""https://www.circuitlab.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">CircuitLab</a></sup></p>

<p>What is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_impedance"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">impedance</a> of this circuit? Well, the impedance of a capacitor is:</p>

<p>$$ Z_C = -j\frac{1}{\omega C} $$</p>

<p>And an inductor:</p>

<p>$$ Z_L = j \omega L $$</p>

<p>$\omega$ is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_frequency"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">angular frequency</a>, which is just $\omega = 2\pi f$. It's just a different way of expressing frequency that doesn't require the equations to contain a $2\pi$ term all over the place.</p>

<p>Series impedances add, so the impedance of this series circuit is:</p>

<p>$$ -j\frac{1}{\omega 50\cdot 10^{-9}} + j \omega 10.3\cdot 10^{-9} $$</p>

<p>If we pick some frequency, we can simplify this more. Let's try $f=10\:\mathrm{MHz}$, or equivalently $\omega=2\pi 10\:\mathrm{MHz} \approx 62831853$:</p>

<p>$$
-j\frac{1}{62831853 \cdot 50\cdot 10^{-9}} + j 62831853 \cdot 10.3\cdot 10^{-9} \\
= -j0.3183 + j0.6472 \\
= (0+j0.3289) \Omega
$$</p>

<p>If we try again at 7 MHz, we get a slightly different answer. I won't write out all the math, but the answer is $(0-j0.0017)\Omega$. In fact, if we pick just the right frequency, then the impedances of the capacitor and the inductor cancel, and the circuit looks like a dead short. But only at that one frequency.</p>

<p>This is what we are doing when we tune the antenna: by adjusting the length of the antenna or changing the operating frequency, we are trying to find the point where the reactive components (capacitance and inductance) of the antenna cancel.</p>

<p>But wait, what antenna looks like a dead short? Any effective antenna will have another impedance in the circuit, the radiation resistance<sup>1</sup>. If electrical power is the product of current and voltage, then we need to both move a current, and move it against some voltage, to do work. If we are radiating energy, then against what is the transmitter working? Radiation resistance is that thing.</p>

<p>The radiation resistance looks like a resistor to the transmitter, but unlike a resistor it doesn't get hot because the energy is radiated away. Calculating the radiation resistance in general involves solving <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Maxwell's equations</a> for your antenna and all the space around it. That's hard, but we can find solutions for common antenna types. For example, <a href=""http://www.antenna-theory.com/antennas/shortdipole.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">antenna-theory.com gives the radiation resistance of a short dipole</a> as:</p>

<p>$$ R_{rad} = 20\pi^2 \left(L\over\lambda\right)^2 $$</p>

<p>This is for a <em>short</em> dipole, which is one that is less than a tenth of a wavelength long, which allows us to make the simplifying assumption of constant current throughout the entire antenna. Usually we use half-wave dipoles which are not short so this simplification does not apply, and the equation is more complex<sup>2</sup>. However, notice there is a wavelength ($\lambda$) term in the equation, which means radiation resistance is frequency dependent.</p>

<p>So, as you can see, every term that goes into calculating an antenna impedance is frequency dependent. Even though the real part of the complex impedance is sometimes called the ""resistive"" part, this means it looks like a resistance at that one frequency. It does not mean it is a resistance, which is frequency independent.</p>

<p><sup>1: I suggest not reading the Wikipedia article on radiation resistance. It's horrible, and I just removed two really wrong statements from it.</sup></p>

<p><sup>2: Antenna modelling programs like EZNEC work by breaking the antenna into a bunch of short segments and analyzing each segment individually, which is why this is a useful model.</sup></p>

","<p>Because Skystar card works as a network device. Physical layer is DVB-S signal on 1.2 GHz band comming from parabolic antenna converting from Ku or C band via LNB. Data stream is only downlink (no uplink or packet acknowlegment) and there are used error-correction codes based on Reed-Solomon which help to recover data on reception side (sometimes it is not possible because 10 GHz Ku-band does not ""like"" heavy rain :)</p>

<p>I was using this card for reception of Meteosat images via EUMETCAST. Eumetsat distributes satellite data to users via a regular TV satellite (it was Hotbird6, not it is Eurobird9). So on the one frequency, there are many multicast data streams identified via Packet ID (they IP addresses started with 224.223.xxx.xxx). I was using Linux, so there were many virtual ethernet devices for each PID linked binded with Skystar driver and routed to final dummy0 device by smcroute. Special software Tellicast is used for storing files on disk (they are usually encrypted and you need to be registered and have a hardware key) and another software for data decompression and display.</p>

"Two Antenna Tuners in Series","167","","<p>My radio has an internal antenna tuner that can be activated to rapidly tune for the frequency in use.</p>

<p>My antenna has a disgusting SWR for the band I want to use (as measured with an AA-54 antenna analyzer). When activating the internal antenna tuner, it reports multiple occurrences of ""Bad SWR"" (or something like that). I don't know what the radio does with that information i.e. maybe it refuses to transmit?!? (I'd have to look that up in the manual).</p>

<p>Because of this ""Bad SWR"" report from the radio, I am fearful of burning out my radio by attempting to transmit on this problem band.</p>

<p>If I connected an external antenna tuner between the antenna feed and my radio, would/could the external tuner get the signal into ""the ballpark"" for a more tolerable SWR and then let the internal antenna tuner fine tune that ballpark SWR for a final SWR that would be acceptable to the radio? Or would it not be of any help?</p>

<p>Well, now you just have more elements which can be adjusted. There's nothing inherently wrong here. In fact it gives you additional tuning range.</p>

<p>Internal tuners usually do not have much range, and it's likely with an external tuner you won't even need the internal tuner. You might consider simply disabling the internal tuner. Or if your external tuner is manual, you could adjust it for a good match at the middle of the band, then enable the internal tuner to compensate for the slight mismatch as you move within the band. If the external tuner is automatic, I can't really think of a reason you'd need both.</p>

<p>Another possibility given your situation: skip the external tuner, and instead just pick some fixed component(s) to make a matching network. It's cheaper than buying an adjustable tuner if you don't already have one, in fact you can probably build it from scrap you already have. And you can then mount it outside at the antenna feedpoint to reduce feedline losses.</p>

"Frequency Modulated Light","164","","<p>I've been doing a bit of work on optical open-air transmission, and have been thinking, any hays that varies the intensity of the light or whatever else would affect the amplitude. </p>

<p>Would it be possible to send and receive a frequency modulated light transmission? And if so how hard would it be?</p>
","<p>Technically speaking, frequency modulation of light would involve shifting the color since, if you look at the EM spectrum, you basically see a rainbow in the visible part of it from red (lowest frequency) to violet (highest frequency).  If you wanted to, you could take the original signal, run it through an analog-to-digital converter, and do the calculations to modulate the different parts of an RGB LED.  The receiving side of that wouldn't be trivial, though, but it could be done.</p>

<p>Most light modulation that I've seen has instead been amplitude modulation.  The details for the circuit would depend on what you're using for a light source, but it's basically a matter of making the light bright or dim based on the input signal.  The receiving side for this could be a simple phototransistor circuit.</p>

<p>One possibility that would combine both would work better for digital signals, and that would be to approach it like the way that RTTY works for radio waves.  Use two colors of light, the more distinguishable the better, one for your ""high"" and one for your ""low"" frequency.  You then shift between the two to transmit, and use 2 phototransistor circuits behind 2 color filters matching what you're sending to receive.  You would probably need to use amplitude modulation as well, if only to filter out stray light, just like IR remote controls do.</p>

"How Are US Call Sign Location ID's Assigned?","164","","<p>If I take my license exam in California, but my residence is in New York, would my call sign still reflect the New York location?</p>

Thus, if you take the test in California but use a NY address then you will be assigned a call sign appropriate for your license level for New York which uses the 2 zone.</p>

<p>Licenses like for a Technician license are issued usually as a 2x3 call sign and the suffix usually is assigned in alphabetic order.  So, for example, you could be issued something like a KG2XYZ call sign.  I am not sure about the 'G' part of the prefix or where the suffix falls but there are web sites where you can find out what that is because they list the most recently issued licenses for each zone number.</p>

<p>If you want though, after licensed you can request a Vanity call sign and it can be any available and legal US call sign you choose.  A friend I know here in the state of Washington requested a Vanity callsign in the 0 zone because the suffix he wanted was his three kids first name initials.

<p>If you apply for a more advanced license, you can possibly get a 1x3 call sign or maybe even a 2x2 call sign.</p>

<p>In case you are unaware, the different call signs are known by how many letters are before the zone number and how many after.  So, a 1x3 call sign is like mine, K7PEH.

"Why do some antennas list modulation type alongside power rating?","163","","<p>Looking at HF antennas I've noticed that occasionally I'll see power ratings similar to ""200W (SSB)"".</p>

<p>Why would the modulation matter for an antenna's power output rating, and in the absence of other information how does one properly derate such an antenna for other modes?</p>
","<p><strong>It's about transmission duty cycles.</strong></p>

<p>For example, FM has a very high duty cycle during transmission: the transmitter's output power is constantly at 100% regardless of the amount of modulation. AM varies between 50% (carrier only) and 100% (full modulation). SSB varies with modulation between 0% and 100%. CW is like FM, 100% power output during transmission, but the actual periods of transmission are shorter for an overall much lower duty cycle than FM. PSK31 is somewhere in between FM and CW, with a high transmit power and moderate length transmissions. And so on.</p>

<p>What the manufacturer is telling you is mostly <strong>how much sustained power the antenna can tolerate.</strong> This is a matter more of heat buildup than e.g. the risk of arcing across components.</p>

<p>What this means is of course also that without a specified duty cycle, the ""SSB"" figure is largely meaningless. If you have weak modulation, you can run the transmitter at a much higher power output setting than the 200W indicated because you really aren't pushing very much power to the antenna. Conversely, if you have a very strong modulation, it's possible that the antenna can't take the power even though you have tuned the transmitter to a lower power output, because the <em>actual</em> power being fed to the antenna is higher than the manufacturer intended.</p>

<p>If you know what duty cycle (in percent) the manufacturer's specifications assumes, then you can work backwards to a safe continuous power. For example, if the maximum is 200W at 60% duty cycle, then the maximum safe continuous power is in the neighborhood of 60% * 200W = 120W. If the antenna is sold for amateur radio use we should also assume that the transmitter is not active 100% of the time, giving the antenna time to cool off. For a <em>truly continuous transmission</em>, you'd probably want to reduce the number to about one tenth, to simulate a 10% transmit 90% receive cycle. <em>Once you know the safe continuous power, you can easily work your way backwards to any transmission mode.</em></p>

<p><strong>The other side of the coin</strong> is the maximum instantaneous power that the antenna can handle. This is easier, since we can fairly safely assume that the manufacturer wouldn't say 200 W <em>anything</em> unless the antenna is capable of handling an instantaneous 200 W of RF. This is where issues such as arcing across coil windings, power handling capability at the feedpoint, etc., come in.</p>

"Unexpected Resonance - Dual-Band Dipole","162","","<p>I tried to make a dual-band (2m/70cm) dipole this morning by following the instructions on this page: <a href=""http://www.amateurradio.bz/2m-70cm_vertical_dipole_antenna.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.amateurradio.bz/2m-70cm_vertical_dipole_antenna.html</a>, with the rather major significant exception of placing the antenna's elements in a groove I routed out of a 2x4 and I'm using bare #10 copper wire instead of stainless steel.</p>

<p>I plugged a VNA into it and the antenna's lowest SWR was ~1.09 at ~124MHz. I tried it in a couple different environments and orientations and made sure there wasn't anything conductive right near the antenna (other than the wood, which I'm expecting to reduce the effective velocity factor of the wire.</p>

<p>Since I have no shortage of #10 wire, I started trimming the ends in 1/2"" increments. I got the lowest SWR to 1.04 at 148MHz... but only while horizontal! Orienting the antenna vertically causes the lowest SWR point to jump to 1.52 at 153MHz.</p>

<p>What's happening here? Why was the tuning so far off? Is it the wood? Is it the copper wire? Why does orientation affect the tuning so much? I know I've got a lot of variables here, but is there one that is obviously the most important difference?</p>
","<p>It was the wood!</p>

<p>It may <em>also</em> be the fact that I'm using copper wire instead of stainless steel rod, but I can't test that as I don't have access to any stainless.</p>

<p>Further experimentation this evening show much more predictable results. While I thought the 2x4 would be relatively transparent to RF, simply being near the 2x4 seems to cause the whole system to seem electrically much longer than it is, thus making the antenna very difficult to tune.</p>

<p>At first, I thought that it was conducting RF to the wood because the wire was bare, but I cut new elements just now out of my solid-core #10 THHN, this time leaving the THHN on everywhere except where the bolts contact the wire and had basically the same results. Bending the wire away from the wood such that the tips of the dipole (where voltage is highest?) caused the match to jump from 118MHz to 137MHz.</p>

<p>My best guess here is that the lumber is not fully dried and whatever water left in it is causing it to be a (poor) conductor, causing some capacitative coupling. I'd still love for anybody with more experience to chime in though, as I'm just guessing and am pretty new to making antennas.</p>

"Key CW on zero crossings - zero bandwidth?","161","","<p>I remember being surprised to learn that a CW signal has a bandwidth (albeit small), but when I thought it over, it made sense. Essentially, we are modulating the carrier with a low frequency square wave. This would explain key clicks: a perfect square wave has infinite bandwidth, but if you smooth the rising and falling edges, the bandwidth goes down.</p>

<p>This got me thinking. If, theoretically, we could key up and key down precisely on the zero-crossings of the carrier, it seems to me that there would not be any distinct rising or falling edge. Then, would the signal have zero bandwidth?</p>

<p>(I haven't the slightest idea whether this would be practical in practice. I have to assume either a) it's not or b) I'm wrong about this theory, because otherwise I'm sure transmitters would already do this.)</p>
","<p>You raise an excellent question and your thought processes are indeed on the right track.</p>

<p>First some background. An ideal, uninterrupted sinusoidal carrier has zero bandwidth. Real world factors such as phase noise, amplifier distortion, etc. produce a measurable bandwidth of the carrier. When the carrier is keyed on and off as it is with Morse code, this is a special form of ASK (Amplitude Shift Keying) called OOK (On Off Keying) as it is discussed in professional literature. Normally, the bandwidth of the modulated OOK signal is minimized when the keying waveform rise and fall times take on a Gaussian or raised cosine form. Most amateur radio transceivers are using simpler RC filtering to shape the keying waveform, resulting in less than ideal bandwidth but at least avoiding the key clicks from the otherwise sharp raise and fall time of the modulating signal. In any case, it is the rise and fall shape of the keying waveform that determines the bandwidth of the modulated signal.</p>

<p>When the transition of the modulating signal is synchronized with the zero crossing of the carrier signal, this is known as <em>coherent OOK modulation</em>. This is, of course, much more difficult to implement than a simple, non-coherent RC filtering scheme so it is not commonly seen in amateur radio applications. However, when implemented properly coherent OOK does reduce, but does not eliminate, the signal bandwidth. The ""residual"" bandwidth is largely due to a variety of real world factors including non-instantaneous keying time which introduces a distortion of the carrier waveform. Any distortion, no matter how small, of the sinusoidal carrier will result in a non-zero bandwidth.</p>

<p>[EDIT] Even with ideal zero crossing switching and ideal amplification, there will be minor sidebands but these will roll off as a function of frequency at a significantly greater rate than switching at non-zero points. With zero crossing switching, however, non-linear amplification present in most CW transmitters will likely introduce greater side band components than those caused by zero crossing switching. [/EDIT]</p>

<p>So you could win over some of the CW aficionados with a coherent OOK transmitter but in a hobby market the commercial viability of such a transmitter would be a question of price elasticity. Perhaps in this new era of DSP based radios, the lowered cost of implementation will make this commercially viable. But given that few, such as the Elecraft K3, amateur radio transceivers implement Gaussian keying, we still have a ways to go to optimize the bandwidth of our CW signals.</p>

<p>The reason I say it is not an RF connector is because it only makes one electrical contact. This means it can only be used for “monopole” antennas, not for feed lines or other types of antennas.</p>

<p>To confirm, first check that the end of the antenna is solid metal and not anything more complex than that. Then take the antenna down to your local hardware/home improvement store — or your garage, if you're well equipped — and try it against a 3/8""-24 nut.</p>

"Linear-Loaded Cage Dipole?","158","","<p>I've recently learned about linear loaded dipoles as one way of building a physically shortened antenna. As I understand it, any shortened antenna will have reduced bandwidth and linear-loaded dipoles suffer from this as well.</p>

<p>I was thinking to  counteract this by adding a second parallel element about a foot from the first, folded in the opposite direction created a linear-loaded cage dipole. </p>

<ul>
<li>Is this a feasible solution? Put another way, would it actually give me usefully increased bandwidth?</li>
<li>From a terminology standpoint, does it require a third element to be a cage dipole?</li>
<li>Is there an all-around better option for an 80m antenna in ~70ft of linear space?  </li>
</ul>
","<p>An 80 meter dipole shortened to a length of 70 feet or less will require some type of additional matching circuit even with linear loading. The linear loading will help to reduce some of the reactive component but the resistive part of the impedance will also require some additional adjustment. This is typically done with an ATU (Antenna Tuning Unit).</p>

<p>Given that there is likely to be an ATU in the antenna system, there is no point in trying to increase the bandwidth of the dipole by building it in a cage configuration. The ATU will take care of any SWR bandwidth limitation by shifting the match point of the antenna system.</p>

<p>To maximize the performance of shortened antennas, the efficiency of the antenna system is normally of the greatest concern. This usually involves design trade-offs in impedance matching techniques. One of the most efficient methods for a shortened dipole is to use capacity hats at the end of the dipole. While this is not usable in all situations, a 40"" diameter hat on the each end of your shortened dipole would go a long ways to obtaining an efficient match. Also consider the placement of the ATU and the losses in the feedline(s) due to SWR as part of your efficiency calculation.</p>

<p>The Chu limit is not applicable to your situation as this is typically used to be certain that the antenna can radiate the entire bandwidth of the modulated signal. Since our HF modulation methods are generally 12 KHz bandwidth or less, the calculation is meaningless. Even a very high Q antenna such as a small loop can fully handle the modulation bandwidth of HF signals. If you were considering HDTV type transmissions on UHF with a small form factor antenna, as an example, then the Chu limit might come into scope.</p>

"Losing Low Frequencies in AM transmission","158","","<p>I've been using a USRP software-defined radio to try to send an amplitude modulated signal to a very basic receiver, basically just a piece of wire as an antenna, over a very short distance.  The signal, a wav file of me counting to ten, is transmitted clearly enough to be understood by a human, but not by a speech-to-text program.  The received signal is also clearly much higher in frequency than the transmitted signal.  I took FFTs(illustrations provided below) of the sent and received signals and it seems clear to me that the lower frequencies in the signal are not being transmitted as strongly.  The solution I've been trying to work on is adjusting the signal I'm transmitting by amplifying the lower frequencies of the signal and attenuating the higher frequencies using Python to modify the original wav file.  My question is whether this seems like a viable solution or not?  Is it possible to make up for a transfer function that is making it difficult to transmit the low frequency parts of the signal by amplifying those parts of the signal in the file to be transmitted?</p>

<p>Here is the GnuRadio flowchart I'm using for the USRP transmission:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/hH4MtwU.png"" alt=""GnuRadio flowchart""></p>
","<p>You are not making an AM transmission, because you have not added a carrier. Without a carrier, what you have is <em>double sideband</em> (DSB) modulation, which will not be properly demodulated just by an improvised detector.</p>

<p>To create the carrier, <strong>add a constant value</strong> to the signal (between the Multiply Const and Float To Complex stages).</p>

<p>Constraints:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The carrier should be of greater amplitude than the peak level of the modulating signal, to avoid <em>overmodulation</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>You should also make sure that the final signal does not exceed a level of ±1, which would cause it to be clipped (distorted) by the USRP's DAC or a preceding float-to-integer conversion.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Together, these constraints mean that for best dynamic range your carrier should have a value of 0.5, and the input signal, if it had a maximum range of ±1 (which I believe is true for GR WAV sources, but your file may be significantly quieter), should be multiplied by 0.5, so that the resulting signal has a range of 0 to 1.</p>

<hr>

<p>I would recommend visualizing your signal by adding a GUI FFT Sink in parallel with the UHD sink, to observe that it has the proper spectrum of an AM signal. If you wanted to simulate the effects of quantization and possible clipping, you could do so by converting the signal to short or byte and back before feeding it to the FFT sink.</p>

"Lightning protection by disconnect","157","","<p>Currently I am evaluating options for my antenna's in regards to lightning protection. </p>

<p>My setup is a physical disconnect of all my antennas using an outside ""patch panel"". So every time I power up my station, I have to go outside and physically connect the antenna feeds to a patch panel which brings the feed inside.</p>

<p><strong>Theoretically this is probably the best protection</strong>, however <strong>it is getting a bit of a nuisance</strong>. So I am looking at alternatives.
[emphasis added, due to comments]</p>

<p>One of the obvious choices would be a lightning protector, there are various models and types, and there is plenty of information available.</p>

<p>However I have found an <a href=""https://paradanradio.com/products/antenna-disconnect"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Antenna Disconnect</a> product which seems to be a good fit as well.</p>

<p>The link provided is only an example, there are others. Or even ""home brew"" circuitry which can be found by searching using a search engine.</p>

<p>My question: what would be the theoretical disadvantages of such a disconnect system ?</p>

<p>[edit 1]
I am not in a high-risk strike area, however we do have 2-3 lightning storms annually. Direct strikes have not occurred in a 10-km radius for the last 10-years (which is obviously not a guarantee that they can not occur)</p>

<p>[edit 2] 
I am aware of electrical code.</p>

<p>Any comments welcome.</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>what would be the theoretical disadvantages of such a disconnect system?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Firstly, keep in mind that antennas don't cause lightning damage: grounds do. It's not clear from your description if your patch panel is grounded at the same point as your electrical service or not.</p>

<p>If it's not, you have two separate grounds. This doesn't comply with the NEC, and it increases the risk of lightning damage since lowest impedance path from one ground (electrical service entry) to the other (patch panel) involves going through your equipment. See <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/q/51/218"">How can I protect equipment against a lightning strike?</a> and an excellent <a href=""https://www.w8ji.com/lightning_strikes.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">example from W8JI</a> where a strike on a tree 20 feet away arced back out of the ground to travel down a beverage antenna which was grounded on the far end.</p>

<p>Assuming you have a good single point ground, the purpose of the disconnect, surge protector, or any other device you might put at that point is not to handle the surge current, but rather to keep all the conductors at about the same voltage. Lightning is common-mode, so fortunately most of that energy will be flowing on the shield, leaving whatever protection device you choose with a relatively small amount of energy to deal with.</p>

<p>Just any method of disconnecting may not be effective: the voltages involved may still be high enough to arc across gaps. They are certainly high enough to blow past any solid state devices. <a href=""https://www.w8ji.com/ground_systems.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">W8JI recommends a double-make double-break relay</a>, with the reasoning being that any arcs will most likely go to ground. He does not use coaxial surge protectors, and has never had a radio damaged.</p>

<p>Commercial installations operate continuously and don't disconnect the antennas. Most use a DC block surge protector like the Polyphaser IS-50 series. I don't have any relay control system so I use this approach. My first one I bought new, but I recently decided <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/q/9042/218"">used units are probably fine too</a>. Used they go for about $25 USD, which is about as much as I'd expect to pay for a disconnect device or the parts to build one. I like that there's no chance of forgetting to disconnect something.</p>

<p>Both these systems work, which I think shows that it's not the protectors or the disconnects, but rather the ground system that makes it work.</p>

","<p>They don't ""measure"", they just <em>display</em>. </p>

<p>And yes, as you noticed, this is digital signal processing, so there's no physical units involved – the display axes are correctly labeled with ""dB"", as in ""dB relative to an arbitrary reference vector"", typically a energy=1 time signal (e.g. $(0,\ldots,0,1,0,\ldots,0)$), or a power=1 signal (e.g. $(1,\ldots,1)$).</p>

<p>So the value displayed by WX and QT only differs by a fixed dB offset; the difference, if I remember correctly, is only the length of the DFT being used as normalizing factor for one, but not the other sink. (By the way, there's historically been a long discussion about what's ""right"" to use as references. Turns out that's hard to say.)</p>

<p>-Thanks.</p>
","<p>Nice try but that's definitely not how you calculate gain!</p>

<p>Gain depends on many things, but first is the number of dipole elements in the stack. You could estimate the gain by guessing the number of half-wave dipoles that fit in the antenna. I suppose in your case a 300 mm antenna would fit four dipoles, to leave space for the top cap, connector and matching at the bottom.</p>

<p>Then the maximum theoretical gain will be:</p>

<p>2 dBi for the first dipole, + 3 dB for each further doubling, so 8 dBi.</p>

<p>In practice, each additional antenna also brings some further losses. So it is probably closer to: 1 dBi for one dipole, 3 dBi for two, 5 dBi for 4, 7 dBi for 8.</p>

<p>I've never heard of 20 dBi in an omni before. That would require a minimum length of 32 wavelengths, 3 m, and more in practice. It would have an elevation beamwidth of around 1 degree. Not much use having such a flat beam anyway. I think you have a 5 or 6 dBi omni, which should give you about double the range of the little dipole that comes with the router.</p>

"Troposcatter: really all that bad?","155","","<p>The previous question,</p>

<p><a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/questions/7489/packet-radio-at-100-miles"">Packet Radio at 100 miles</a></p>

<p>and specifically, <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/a/7492/4076"">Phil's answer</a> raised an interesting question:</p>

<p>In a 50–100 km distance situation where Line-Of-Sight beams aren't an option for communicating data, can we, given the technological advances of the last decades, again consider troposcatter a sensible mode of operation for moderately high-rate bidirectional communication?</p>

<p>I ask because troposcatter typically has the reputation of needing pretty large TX powers, and pretty high-gain antennas. Which does sound reasonable, since, obviously, we rely on the reflection of something which isn't such a great reflector at all, plus the area we'd illuminate with an isotropic antenna would be huge (considering a sphere with r=100 km or more).</p>

<p>On the upside, we get great ranges if we actually do blast out a lot of power and aim large antennas at the horizon.</p>

<p>I'd assume you'd want to operate somewhere around 2.3 GHz. The best model description I've found (that wasn't ""oh, we've always used these 2 models, and it doesn't really work all that well, but we didn't check for other models"" <a href=""http://www.nitehawk.com/w3sz/W3SZ-PackRatsConference2014.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">example</a> ) is from this nearly ancient Master's thesis:</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a220969.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">available online</a></p>

<p>After inspecting the summaries on the different models, I think that for VHF, UHF frequencies, probably what the call CCIR method II (by Boithias and Battesti) is what I'd want to look at. However, best graph I could produce on short notice (p.162 from that thesis):</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WLA9e.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WLA9e.png"" alt=""att CCIR method II""></a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>for other frequencies, a factor of $30\log f_\text{GHz}$ is added. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>so, I'd need to add another 3 dB; OK. Now, going for a &lt; 1% outage time, I'd have to read both the upper (year average) and lower (worst month) chart's lower two curves (99% and 99.5% temporal availability). That yields something between 212 dB and 216 dB (average) / 218 dB to 222 dB (worst month) attenuation for a 150 km link.</p>

<p>Now, assuming we don't want to overdo it with antennas, an antenna gain of ~ 18dB on each end sounds realistic. Swinging with -220 dB tropo path loss, we thus get an overall loss of -184 dB.</p>

<p>Admittedly, not very little, still much better than GPS reception, and we legally get up to 10 MHz of bandwidth in that band! (as far as I understand)</p>

<p>Ok, rough capacity estimate: </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uOnSa.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uOnSa.png"" alt=""channel capacity""></a></p>

<p>Rolling a few numbers in my head, assume we want to get a code bit rate of let's say 200 kb/s. We'd want to stay a solid factor of 4 below the channel capacity (<strong>please correct me!</strong>), so that requires about 46 dBm transmit power – 40 W. </p>

<p>I don't think the atmosphere will allow for reliable amplitude estimation, (<strong>please correct me!</strong>) so I'd roll with QPSK for an initial estimate. </p>

<p>That gives me the rough feeling that we have plenty of headroom (like, 99 times what we use) to add robustness – be it through spreading, channel codes, or stupid spectral repetition.</p>

<p>This all breaks down on one thing, though:</p>

<p>I could find out <em>nil</em> about the properties of the 2.3 GHz tropo channel w.r.t.</p>

<ul>
<li>Doppler Spread</li>
<li>Coherency Time</li>
<li>Deep Fade probabilities</li>
</ul>

<p>I might very much be coming from an indoor / close-range background, but this feels like I might be missing something important. </p>

<p>So</p>

<li><strong>Does anyone have info on the above properties of the wireless troposcanner channel</strong>?</li>
<li><strong>Am I looking the wrong way, using the wrong tools to understand that channel?</strong></li>

<li><strong>Is a 40W 2.3 GHz amp suitable for PSK realistic?</strong></li>
</ul>
","<p>I don't think a better answer will come along, so I'll summarize a combination of assembled anecdotes and opinion.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, your calculations are accurate. I did a little research for <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/questions/1497/can-tropospheric-scatter-effect-be-used-by-802-11-links"">Can tropospheric scatter effect be used by 802.11 links?</a> and determined the requirements aren't absurd, and at least within the grasp of a typical amateur.</p>

<p>Anecdotally, I've read of hams doing troposcatter on 2 meters. Many of the troposcatter studies I've seen don't consider anything below 2.4 GHz, so I guess it's possible.</p>

<p>Of course a 40W amplifier for 2 meters is common ham gear. 2.4 GHz isn't nearly as popular for hams, but a quick search turned up plenty of 10W amplifiers intended for 2.4 GHz WiFi.</p>

<p>I also was not able to find any details on the channel besides loss. However, I see many examples of military systems like these:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Siqv6.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Siqv6.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Some are mounted on trucks. I've read each horn has two polarities. We can infer the quad antenna diversity setup is to counter channel fading which must be significant. Although, the military certainly has higher reliability requirements than an amateur. HF channels have similar properties and that hasn't stopped anyone.</p>

<p>Anecdotally, most of the amateur troposcatter seems to be SSB or CW from VHF DX enthusiasts. I'm not active in this space personally, but I do know some weak-signal digital modes are gaining popularity there. WSJT is notable, and JT65 in particular which I have used personally on HF. It's very slow and not meant to exchange anything but a call sign and a signal report over a QSO that lasts several minutes.</p>

<p>D-STAR is a popular GMSK digital voice mode since Icom puts it in all their radios. It must be the most common digital mode on amateur VHF with a moderate bit rate. It has a data mode which enables a payload of arbitrary data instead of the usual proprietary AMBE codec for voice. I've no idea how suitable for troposcatter it would be.</p>

The disadvantage is that it retransmits all the noise it hears and cannot clean up the modulation along the way — very much like how putting an amplifier before your receiver can't improve the signal-to-noise ratio.</p>

<p>A typical FM repeater consists of a fairly ordinary receiver and transmitter, with the audio output of the receiver connected to the (microphone) audio input of the transmitter.</p>

<p>The second most critical element is a <em>duplexer</em>, which is a pair of very narrow filters which ensure that the receiver is not overloaded by the transmitted signal on the same antenna. (The less-usual case of a <em>cross-band</em> repeater, which has far more frequency separation between transmit and receive frequencies, does not need a duplexer.)</p>

<p>Finally, you usually have a repeater controller, which can be connected to the audio, PTT, etc. signals from/to the radios in order to implement additional features (repeater ID, time-out timer, repeater linking/phone patch, etc.).</p>

"Connecting two SDRs together for one to act as a signal generator","153","","<p>If I have two SDRs like the BladeRF and I want to use one as a signal generator and connect them together do I have to attenuate the connections? </p>
","<p>It depends on the specifications of the particular hardware, but in most cases <strong>yes, you must use an attenuator.</strong> Specifically, you want to compare the <em>maximum transmit power</em> (how much power the transmitter can produce) to the <em>maximum receive power</em> (the incoming power above which the receiver will be damaged).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, at a glance the bladeRF web site doesn't give these specifications, so <strong>for the purposes of this answer I'll use the published figures for the <a href=""https://github.com/mossmann/hackrf/wiki/HackRF-One"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">HackRF One</a> instead,</strong> but you’ll have to obtain the specs for your own hardware. The maximum transmit power in that case is given as 15 dBm (decibels relative to one milliwatt; i.e. 31 milliwatts). The maximum receive power is given as -5 dBm. Since we have them in the form of decibels, we can subtract the latter from the former to conclude there is a <strong>20 dB</strong> gap.</p>

<p>This means that for this example you should use an attenuator of <strong>at least</strong> 20 dB to avoid hardware damage. You may need even more attenuation than that to avoid distortion of the received signal, as the point of hardware damage is likely above the point of <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/a/2479/76"">clipping</a>.</p>

<p>You <em>could</em> use less attenuation by configuring your devices properly. For example, you can decrease transmit amplifier gain or send lower-amplitude samples, and you can also decrease or shut off receive amplification. But this is running the risk of hardware damage due to software misconfiguration — do you really want to take that chance? (However, using transmit power controls to avoid clipping on the receive side or to simulate a weaker signal is reasonable.)</p>

<p>For my own testing purposes, I am using a 0-80 dB manually-variable attenuator I picked up at a flea market. I find it quite useful and recommend you obtain a similar device if you can (new ones can be fairly expensive, however).</p>

<hr>

<p>While you asked about software-defined radios, everything here is applicable to any other type of radio. Two notes on the subject:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>For higher-power transmitters, transmit power may be given in watts. Convert to dBm, $10\cdot\log_{10}\left(\tfrac{P}{0.001 W}\right)$, and remember that transmit power may be poorly calibrated and exceed the specified value.</p></li>
<li><p>If your receiver does not have maximum receive power specs, you can start with sensitivity specs instead; you'll want to apply <em>more</em> than that signal, but how much more is needed until the signal is adequately received will have to be determined by experiment. This is where a <em>variable</em> attenuator is handy.</p></li>

","<p>They've been shown to only be effective when moved frequently, and even then, some of the biggest pest species like grackles and pigeons catch on quickly and they become completely ineffective, especially when actual predators are scarce. We tried to use them in a garden a couple years ago with very little success, even moving them around every few days.</p>

<p>The bigger question when using them for antennas is, why? If you have issues with birds building nests in your tower or on top of your beams, other methods of exclusion would probably be far more effective. Fiberglass window screen wrapped around the tower at spots where they might try to nest, such as around the rotor plate, ought to do the trick. A few bamboo kabob skewers taped to your beam in the areas where there are big enough flat spots for a nest, such as where the boom meets the elements should also deter nesting there.</p>

<p>If you're concerned about them sitting on the antenna, you aren't likely to do them any harm, and it's pretty unlikely that less than a dozen good sized birds like pigeons will change the characteristics of the antenna noticeably. If droppings are an issue, that could be a bit trickier, but something like a bit of cloth stuck to a motor that spun a few times intermittently to create motion near their favorite perches should deter them. One of the most effective means we discovered was a motion activated lawn sprinkler, which would obviously be impractical to implement on top of your tower, but you can extrapolate other ways of creating motion and/or noise on queue to scare them off.</p>

"Does using a computer SMPS to supply a transceiver bleed hum into the signal?","151","","<p>A dedicated/custom power-supply for an HF rig may, on occasion, be unavailable.

<p>Apparently using a computer SMPS to power a transceiver bleeds hum into the signal. Is there any truth to this? Does using a computer SMPS to supply a transceiver bleed hum into the signal?</p>
","<p>The power supply usually recommended is an ATX computer power supply, which has minimum <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=atx%20specifications%20ripple%20regulation"" rel=""nofollow"">specifications for ripple and regulation</a>.</p>

<p>The minimum standard indicates that:</p>

<ul>
<li>The 12V supply must be within +/- 5% (11.40V to 12.60V)</li>
<li>The ripple in the 10Hz to 20MHz band must be less than 120mV</li>
</ul>

<p>This is fine for computing requirements, but terrible for radio and analog use. Note that the specification doesn't care about ripple above 20MHz, and at that point you've only got the basic bare minimum protections the FCC requires Part B computing equipment to follow.  This can account for a significant amount of noise.</p>

<p>While you can use a PC power supply as a radio supply, the supply may not provide clean enough power to satisfy your personal signal requirements.</p>

<p>Note, however, that this will vary from supply to supply, and from radio to radio.  Radios with very good power supply noise rejection (such as mobile radios designed for vehicle power supplies) may be able to provide good signals with a poor power supply.  Similarly you may find that a particular PC power supply is very clean with low ripple.</p>

<p>Due to the noise inherent with switching power supplies, though, many hams insist on transformer style power supplies with linear regulation and would balk at any switch mode power supply.</p>

<p>If you are concerned about signal quality, choose good power supplies, or quantify the noise your supply generates with a spectrum analyzer. You may also be able to add additional filtering on the output of the power supply to mitigate those issues, but that usually costs more than the savings you had from starting with a cheap PC power supply in the first place.</p>

"Would a switched RF attenuator be (a)symmetric?","148","","<p>I picked up this 0-80 dB switched RF attenuator at a flea market, with no part number or other useful markings other than the knob settings. I've tested it and confirmed that it works, but there's one thing I'm uncertain about which I don't have the theory to be certain of and can't test non-destructively:</p>

<p>Is there potentially <strong>a difference between ""input"" and ""output"" ports</strong>, or is it symmetric? In particular, would there possibly be better or worse <strong>maximum power handling</strong> capability depending on which way around it's connected? If there is a difference, how can I tell which port is which? (They aren't labeled.)</p>

<p>I'm interested in answers which are either general, for all reasonable designs of attenuators, or specific to this unit if you should happen to recognize it. (I have used Google Image Search to try to find things which look like this specific model and haven't succeeded. According to the seller, it was likely an internal module from equipment made by HP.)</p>

<p>If it's unlikely that there's a significant difference, then I'm happy to go ahead and use it as I intend (testing transmitters hooked up to receivers with no antennas involved, no more than 5 watts, not continuous) but if it matters I'd like to use it properly and have less chance of burning it out.

<blockquote>
  <p>...[A]ttenuators are symmetrical, provided the input and output impedances are
  the same. In applications where attenuators are used as impedance-matching
  devices, they are not symmetrical.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A typical attenuator circuit will be a purely resistive network - for example, this pi-network for a balanced attenuator:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/o5CNy.jpg"" alt=""Pi-Type balanced attenuator""></p>

<p>Since both cables coming out of your attenuator are identical and use the same connector, we expect Z1 and Z2 (the impedance seen ""looking into"" each cable) to be equal. What makes things interesting in your case is where the variable resistor (controlled by the knob) is connected. In that case, the most likely design for your attenuator is this T-type network:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/v8f3J.jpg"" alt=""T-Type balanced attenuator""></p>

<p>In this case the most likely location for the variable resistor is at component Rp, so no matter how the attenuator is connected, both Z1 and Z2 are symmetric and Rp performs exactly the same function in the circuit.</p>

<p>To summarize, for this particular case there should be no difference with respect to how your attenuator is connected - either ""direction"" will be fine. In general, it will depend on the input impedance at each connector.</p>

<p>Edit: The answer so far assumes ideal components, but for a real attenuator the power rating of each resistor is important as well. For a mass-produced attenuator, the most likely case is that the power rating is symmetric as well (although presumably unknown). This is because of the ""economy of scale"": using two identical resistors in a circuit is cheaper and easier to design (you only have to do power calculations once but you can use the circuit twice) than using two resistors intentionally chosen to have different power ratings. For this specific attenuator, since it may have been manufactured as a bespoke (one-off) system and not sold commercially, this may not necessarily apply, but it is still the most likely case for the same reason (it's easier to design the circuit that way).</p>

<p>The second radio (that is, which ever radio is not currently being transmitted on), is typically used to listen on a different band while they are transmitting with the first radio.

","<blockquote>
  <p>Is it ok to get a bunch of RG-58 sized connectors so that thinner types of coax will fit as well?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not if you want to do it right. Proper termination of coax requires a smooth transition from the coax shield to the connector. Mechanical compatibility is an issue as well if you don't want your cables constantly breaking.</p>

<p>I've never seen a solder-on SMA connector except for semi-rigid coax. Usually they come in two kinds: clamp and crimp.</p>

<h2>Clamp</h2>

<p>An example of the clamp type is <a href=""https://www.amphenolrf.com/downloads/dl/file/id/35/product/3098/assembly_instructions_c44.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Amphenol 901-128-11</a>. This has a clamp nut assembly which the cable passes through, then the shield is folded back upon it. The plug then threads onto the clamp nut, with the folded back shield clamped between the two pieces. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JbmCx.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JbmCx.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>If the coax is too large, it will not pass through the clamp nut. If the coax is too small, it might work well enough. The coax will flop around, which will eventually fatigue the metal in the shield. And the geometry of the connector will be out of specification, compromising high frequency performance. Below 1 GHz you may not notice.</p>

<p>Clamp connectors don't require any special tool to install. That's about the only advantage they have. In an application where the cables are frequently handled, expect them to fail either due to working themselves loose, or from the shield breaking where all the strain is focused at the clamp point.</p>

<h2>Crimp</h2>

<p>An example of a crimp connector is <a href=""https://www.amphenolrf.com/downloads/dl/file/id/6423/product/3034/assembly_instructions_c53.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Amphenol 901-9511</a>. These connector have an inner ferrule which slips between the connector shield and dielectric. An outer ferrule is then crimped over it, making both a solid mechanical and electrical connection.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ta9e4.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ta9e4.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>If the coax is the wrong size in either direction then the ferrule won't fit at all.</p>

<p>Crimp connectors are the way to go. You'll have to buy a crimp tool, but they're less clunky, and the crimp provides a more solid mechanical connection which takes the strain off the cable braid. They will never come loose. They never fail.</p>

","<p>You are probably familiar with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_wave_ratio"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SWR</a>, where 1:1 represents a perfect match. SWR quantifies the magnitude of mismatch between two impedances, such as the antenna and the transmission line. As the two impedances become more unequal, the SWR increases.</p>

<p>The SWR does not change with the length of the transmission line, as long as that transmission line is lossless. Usually transmission losses are low enough to be negligible for impedance calculations.</p>

<p>SWR tells you the magnitude of mismatch, but nothing about the relative impedances. For example, 25Ω and 200Ω are both a 2:1 SWR to 50Ω coax. There are also any number of complex impedances that are also a 2:1 SWR.</p>

<p>There is a more general concept to represent mismatches: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_coefficient"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">reflection coefficient</a> ($\Gamma$). It's a complex number that quantifies not only the magnitude of the mismatch, but also the phase.</p>

<p>I find it easiest to visualize on a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_chart"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Smith Chart</a>. Let's say we have a 300Ω ladder line, and a load (an antenna, say) with an (arbitrarily selected) impedance of (90+150j)Ω. In the Smith Chart, the center represents our target impedance (in this case, 300Ω) and all the impedances are normalized to that value. So we divide (90+150j)Ω by 300 to get (0.3+0.5j)Ω, and plot that on the Smith Chart:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LpFQt.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LpFQt.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>By measuring the distance from the center, and the angle, we get the reflection coefficient in polar coordinates.</p>

<p>That's the impedance of the antenna at the feedpoint, normalized to 300Ω. Now let's add a 300Ω transmission line of increasing length, and consider the impedance at the end of it that would be seen, for example by the transmitter.</p>

<p>As the transmission line gets longer, the equivalent impedance moves in a clockwise circle around the center of the chart. This changes the phase of the reflection coefficient, but not the magnitude. Since the magnitude is constant, so is the SWR.</p>

<p>The distance moved around that circle depends on how long the transmission line is. When its a half-wavelength, it will have gone a full circle. A full circle is just a half-wavelength because the reflection must travel over that half-wavelengh twice: there and back.</p>

<p>We can stop at any time and read our new position on the Smith chart. Then, multiply the values read from the Smith chart by the normalized impedance (300Ω in our example). In this example, we end up at (0.28-0.43j)Ω. Multiplied by 300 makes (84-129j)Ω.</p>

<p>What if now we add a 4:1 balun? Depending on which way we orient the balun, we can step the impedance up or down by 4. Let's step down: simply divide the impedance by 4 to get (21-32.25)Ω.</p>

<p>Now, let's add some 50Ω coax. Divide by 50 to get a normalized impedance of (0.42-0.645)Ω. Plot that:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ubsy1.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ubsy1.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>As before, as the transmission line gets longer, the dot moves about the center in a clockwise circle. Multiply the final location by 50 to get the equivalent impedance seen by the transmitter.</p>

<p>As luck would have it, for this 50Ω coax we've ended up a little closer to the center, so the 50Ω coax will have a lower SWR than the 300Ω ladder line. I've just been picking arbitrary impedances and lengths, but with the careful selection of transmission line impedances and lengths this can actually be <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/a/7053/218"">used to match loads</a>.</p>

"Rudementary Impedance measurements for VLF antenna system","145","","<p>I am looking for ideas to improve my Impedance measurements I perform on my VLF antenna system.</p>

<p>Due to circumstances my VLF experiments are usually ""on location / in a field"" so I do not have the luxury of a fully stacked workbench.</p>

<p>The setup I have is:
- a function generator - 4000 Hz output
- an audio amplifier
- feedline
- Antenna</p>

<p>I consider the feedline part of the antenna system, and I use the following method of determining the Impedance of the antenna system:</p>

<ul>
<li>Measure the open output voltage of the Amplifier = Vopen</li>
<li>Measure the output voltage with a known load (Rload=1000) = Vload</li>
<li>Calculate the output impedance of the amplifier Rout = Rload * ((Vopen/Vload)-1)</li>
<li>Measure the output voltage with the antenna system = Vant</li>
<li>Calculate the antenna system impedance Rant = Rout / ((Vopen - Vant)-1)</li>
</ul>

<p>I would repeat this process with multiple values of Rload to ensure measurements are accurat; usually I use the following values: 1000 Ohm and 2400 Ohm.</p>

<p>This way I can determine/tune the antenna system to come as close to 8 ohm impedance which the amplifier wants to see.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<p>1) is this method correct ?</p>

<p>2) are there better methods given the limitation of being ""on location"" ?</p>

<p>First find out if it has a useful two-channel input sound card, and find a way of recording a stereo 16-bit WAV and processing it. Octave or Python would work, or you could write your own.</p>

<p>Then build a circuit like this, adjusting parameters to suit:</p>

<p>Does this only work on specific frequencies, or can this be used for 2M and 70cM dual band HTs with stock antennas? Is it tricky and requires practice, or could someone new to ham radio be taught it and effectively using it in a handful of minutes?</p>

  <p>When the signal is so strong that you can't find the null, tune 5 or 10 KHz off frequency to put the signal into the skirts of the receiver's IF passband.

"Why do we use decibels in radio?","145","","<p>We can measure power in watts, and gain or loss in unitless ratios. So why bother using decibels for these things?</p>
","<p>We use decibels because they are the most intuitive representation when our primary concern is signal quality. Signal quality changes not in proportion to the power added (in watts), but rather to the percentage change. Decibels put ""percentage change"" on a linear scale which is easy and intuitive.</p>

<p>I can't show you with a radio here, but I can show you with a visual analogy. Your monitor is emitting visible electromagnetic energy. Your eye receives this power just like a radio.</p>

<p>I'm going to ""transmit"" an image, with some added noise. The noise power remains constant, but I'll vary the transmit power. After ""receiving"" the image, I'll normalize the contrast of the image to make use of all the pixel values between black and white. This is analogous to what AGC does in a radio. Your job is to decode the image.</p>

<p>Here it is at my maximum transmit power, which we will say is 100 watts, or equivalently 50 dBm.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FBjsu.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FBjsu.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The noise is detectable but the image is still quite clear.</p>

<p>Now I turn my power way down to 30dBm or 1 watt:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xji7N.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xji7N.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I'm totally buried in the noise.</p>

<p>Now let's explore between these two extremes. I'll show a sequence of 100 images, starting and ending at these extremes. The steps between are each an equal increase in either watts or dBm.</p>

<p>Watts first. I'll go from 1 watt to 100 watts, so each step increases power by about 1 watt.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/mFrqc.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/mFrqc.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Notice how the image emerges from the noise almost immediately. About 1 second in you can already see individual jelly beans. By the 2nd half there's no noticeable improvement in quality, even though the power is still increasing by 1 watt each frame.</p>

<p>Now in dBm. I'll go from 30 to 50dBm, so each step is about 0.2dB.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/I3PGW.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/I3PGW.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>This time the image goes through stages of ""I think there could be something in there"", ""I can read 'IPI'"", and ""Hey, those are jelly beans!"" The noise continues to improve up to the end.</p>

<p>By taking the logarithm of power we change watts to dBm, and so ""percentage change"", the real determinant in signal quality, becomes a more intuitive linear unit. I'll demonstrate with a dilemma: would you rather:</p>

<ol>
<li>Have 64x antenna gain, while increasing your power from 1 to 2W, or</li>
<li>Have 8x antenna gain, while increasing your power from 1 to 100W?</li>
</ol>

<p>The dilemma is easier in decibels:</p>

<ol>
<li>Have a 18dB antenna gain, while increasing your power 3dB, or</li>
<li>Have a 9dB antenna gain, while increasing your power 20dB?</li>
</ol>

<p>It's easy to see 18+3=21 is less than 9+20=29, so option 2 is the better choice. And it's easy to quantify how much better: 29-21=8dB. With experience you'll learn <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/q/6676/218"">what a difference 10dB will make</a>, and you can know that 8dB is just a bit less than that.</p>

<p><em>This is a 10dB improvement</em></p>

<p>Power in watts still has some utility. Heat generated and electrical costs are linearly proportional to watts. And it's more convenient to calculate voltages and currents with power in watts.

<p>Is it safe to operate an amplifier based on this design with an SWR measured between the amp and antenna of say 3:1, or are there other factors involved?</p>
","<p>The tests they are referring to are for amplification characteristics like linearity and stability, not continuous thermal dissipation.</p>

<p>That said, unless you've constructed the thing in such a way that the transistor's thermal dissipation capacity is severely derated, it is very rarely heat that kills finals, at least in the short term. While severe and repeated thermal cycles caused by poor design or execution of the cooling system can cause mechanical stress that eventually cause the amp to fail, it takes exceptionally high temperatures to get the silicon itself to fail while it is operating within normal design parameters. Like, ""burn your finger when touching it"" high temperatures. When radios do fail from heat, it is quite often not the finals transistors themselves that fail, at least at first. Peripheral components such as capacitors and resistors are much more likely to go severely out of tolerance when temperatures really start to climb, though as those fail, they may take the finals with them as the circuit fails in a less than graceful manner.</p>

<p>High voltage is far and away the most likely killer of PA transistors in the short term. The 'cooking the transistors' scenario that everybody fears is a misconception that likely stems from the fact that high voltage and high temperatures generally occur under similar conditions, poor impedance matching, and high temperatures are usually far easier to spot than a brief arc.</p>

<p>Arcing can occur for a couple of reasons. Most often it is a failure in a high Q L/C tank somewhere in the antenna or feed system. Such tank circuits are present in filters, tuners, antenna loading systems, and band traps. If the antenna itself presents a very high impedance, or is simply absent due to an operator error, these high Q, resonant tank circuits can ""ring"", inducing <em>very</em> high voltage within the tank, often on the order of 1kV or more. The result is most often directly observed as a ""burned"" plate in a variable capacitor inside an antenna tuner, as the plate spacing of air variable capacitors is often the weakest link in the circuit. Many times this arcing is not fatal to the radio when it happens in some component along the transmission line/antenna chain, but it can be under the right circumstances. If this arcing occurs within the radio, or the circumstances of the arc in the feed/antenna chain allow the high voltage to travel directly back to the radio, the finals may be destroyed almost instantly as the high voltage literally burns through delicate internal structures in the transistor.</p>

<p>For a good example of high voltage appearing in high Q resonant circuits in ham radio applications, a magnetic loop antenna is a very good example. Voltage at the tuning capacitor can often exceed 2kV with just 100 watts input, nearly 10 times the typical peak voltage observed within a 50 ohm antenna system.</p>

<p>All of that said: Is 3:1 safe for your amp?</p>

<p>In all likelihood, yes, but be generous with the selection of your heat sink, use best practices for construction of filters and matching networks, and include a solid safety margin in voltage and temperature ratings when selecting all components </p>

<p>The reflected power will only be a few watts, and the maximum peak to peak (ignoring potential for ringing) voltage will only be about 100V higher than a 50 ohm load would generate. </p>

"Does a receiving antenna need radials?","142","","<p>I am  very new to radio and am using two 433MHz 1/4 wavelength monopole antennas to send and receive data. On the transmitting antenna I'm going to add radials (as it is the standard in my application). However I wonder, would it help adding radials to the receiver too? On the one hand it makes sense, but on the other I wonder, why would a receiver need a ground plane? I hope you can help me and that my question is not too dumb.</p>
","<p>Most antennas are reciprocal — they have the same properties when receiving as when transmitting. This means that in many ways, a good antenna design makes both a good receiving antenna and a good transmitting antenna.</p>

<p>(The biggest exception to this is active antennas which have an internal amplifier that only works for receiving.)</p>

<p>However, the properties that you <em>want</em> for a receiving antenna are not necessarily the same as a transmit antenna. For example, when transmitting, you care about how efficiently the antenna radiates, so that you're getting the best output for power input, and whether it can handle the power without failing (e.g. arcing, heating). Receiving does not care about this a bit, because the power is miniscule.</p>

<p>And if you are receiving, it is often the case that you care more about the <em>signal-to-noise ratio</em>, not the absolute amount of signal you receive.</p>

<p>Now let's talk about radials (or a ground plane) in particular. Every antenna <em>always</em> has two halves, no matter what; if you try to leave one out then either something else will replace it or your antenna won't work at all. If you leave off the radials in an antenna designed to have them, then what happens is the shield of your coax will start acting as the other half — you have instead a vertical dipole with a lower element of no particularly well-designed length or positioning.</p>

<p>This means that your antenna's radiation pattern will not be what you expect — it will receive less well in some directions than it was designed to. Being a too-long antenna, it will have an extra-spiky pattern, so if the other station is moving you'll see lots of nulls (directions with very low signal strength) which is bad for reliable communication.</p>

<p>Additionally, since the coax shield is acting as an antenna element, any noise from your equipment will come into the receiver, more than it would otherwise (that is, a decreased signal-to-noise ratio).</p>

<p>So, to summarize: put on the radials. You will get more predictable performance.</p>

","<blockquote>
  <p>I'm told this antenna has a ""stub match"", but that's not a matching system I'm familiar with.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The matching system is a delta match with a stub. A delta match cannot cancel out the reactance of the driven element so a stub is added to cancel the reactance. The spread connections of the coax on the tube form the delta match and the vertical bars form the stub.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How can I best adapt this antenna for 2 meter use? I don't think I have the proper tools to trim the element lengths.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you noted, the antenna is setup for 155 MHz. To ""trim"" the antenna for 146 MHz, you would need to <em>add</em> length to all of the elements since a lower frequency requires longer elements. To optimize the antenna, you would also need to re-space the elements.</p>

<p>The simplest approach to using this antenna on 2 meters is to note the complex impedance (the R and the X) directly at the antenna at your desired two meter frequency. From this a simple matching network can be constructed to provide a 1:1 SWR on the feedline. The pattern and gain of the antenna will not be optimized but it may prove sufficient for your use.</p>

<p>If you are not familiar with designing a matching network, you may wish to measure and report the R and X values at your chosen two meter frequency (directly connected to the antenna without coax) within your question so that I or others may be prescriptive regarding the matching network you will need. It will likely involve only a single inductor and a single capacitor.</p>

<p>The OP has an updated post that states the impedance at the feed point of the antenna is 36+j40 at 146 MHz. A matching network consisting of a 26 pF capacitor placed across the antenna connection and a 43 nH inductor placed in series with the center coax connection will change this impedance to 50 ohms and result in a near 1:1 SWR on the coax. Such an inductor can be fashioned as 4 turns of 16 or 18 gauge bare wire spaced out 0.5 inches wound on a 0.25 inch form which is then removed. The final SWR can be adjusted by very slightly expanding or compressing the coil.</p>

<p>Since some antenna analyzers do not properly indicate the sign of the reactive part of the impedance, it could be that the impedance is 36-j40. In this case the capacitor should be 14 pF and the inductor 68 nH. But the capacitor now goes across the coax connections and the inductor in series with the center lead of the antenna. The inductor can be fashioned as above but with 5 turns. You may also choose to use a high quality variable capacitor which can add to the adjustability of the matching network. </p>

<p>These matching networks used to take laborious calculations to derive the correct values. But now there are many programs (e.g. Elsie) and on-line calculators that take the drudgery out of the exercise. My favorite on-line calculator is <a href=""http://leleivre.com/rf_lcmatch.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://leleivre.com/rf_lcmatch.html</a>. I used this site to calculate the values shown. Here is a screenshot of the result of the first matching network:</p>

<p>I note that other LC configurations are often possible. I chose to illustrate the versions where the DC properties of the antenna were maintained.</p>

<p>Whatever version of the matching circuit that is used, your antenna analyzer can be used to fine tune the circuit. Simply connect the matching circuit directly to the antenna (without coax) and place the analyzer on the coax side (without coax) of the matching network. Adjust until you show R = 49 to 52 ohms and X as close to zero as possible. Remove the analyzer and connect your coax cable. Double check your measurements at the far end of the coax cable. You should see an SWR close to 1:1. If not, your body and antenna analyzer capacitance may have been interacting with the antenna while you were making your adjustments. The matching circuit can be enclosed in a small plastic or metal container to protect it from the elements.</p>

<p>[/edit]</p>

<p>An alternative approach is to carefully adjust the spacing of the coax connections on the delta match. You may be fortunate to find a spacing that brings it into a reasonable SWR range. This should be done with the antenna supported by a non-conducting pole at least 6 feet away from ground and all other objects. This technique still will not optimize the antenna but as noted above, it may prove usable for your needs.</p>

<p>You could just as well re-optimize the entire antenna by modeling it and adjusting spacing, element length, and the matching network. But given your opening comment stating that you lack the tools to ""trim"" the antenna, I suspect this option is out of the realm of immediate possibilities. In looking at the antenna construction, it also appears that there will not be sufficient boom length to allow the optimization of the spacing.</p>

"Images up and down the spectrum","141","","<p>I brought an rtl-sdr USB  stick to a foreign country.  I am listening with gqrx, and I am surprised to find audio (e.g. television or radio) up and down the spectrum, up to 600, 700 and 800 MHz ranges.  I haven't experienced this in the States.  I can tune up and down several MHz (between say 7 and 20 MHz) and come across the same and different signals at what seem like multiples (I don't have to fine-tune, just tune several MHz at a time.)  They are all WBFM signals  What might cause this?</p>
","<p>Sounds like the receiver is being overloaded by a strong station.</p>

<p>Those inexpensive RTL receivers work by feeding the RF into a quadrature mixer to downconvert the frequency, and then into a pair of analog to digital converters (ADCs). At that point the data are processed by computer software that does all the filtering and demodulation.</p>

<p>Those ADCs have a limited range: 0 is only so small, and 0xFFFF (for a 16 bit ADC) is only so big. Any input outside of this range gets <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipping_%28audio%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">clipped</a>.</p>

<p>Clipping is what we call it in the time domain, where it looks like someone clipped off the tops and bottoms of all the peaks with scissors. In the frequency domain, this generates a bunch of harmonic images. Here's a spectogram of a 40 Hz sine wave that has been clipped:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZU6q7.jpg"" alt=""spectrogram of clipped 40 Hz sine wave.""></p>

<p>You can see here that the 40 Hz signal is repeated at each odd harmonic:</p>

<ul>
<li>120 Hz (40*3)</li>
<li>200 Hz (40*5)</li>
<li>280 Hz (40*7)</li>
<li>etc...</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the same harmonic progression as a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_wave"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">square wave</a>. This makes sense: if you clip a sine wave enough, it becomes a square wave. The spectogram above has a logarithmic frequency scale. On a linear frequency scale, the harmonics look evenly spaced:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kBLFJ.jpg"" alt=""spectogram of square wave""></p>

<p>SDRs have particular difficulty with this problem because their input bandwidth is so large. A wider input bandwidth means more power is making its way to the ADC. When there's too much power, you get clipping. Your software may be tuned to a 15 kHz channel somewhere in the spectrum, but the filtering that selects that one channel happens <em>after</em> the ADC. A much wider bandwidth (as wide as the sample rate of the ADCs) reaches the ADCs. Thus, even if the very strong station isn't the one you are listening to, it can still overload the ADC and cause clipping, which causes harmonic distortion all across the input bandwidth.</p>

<p>You can address this problem by attenuating the RF input until the distortion goes away. More sophisticated radios have automatic gain control (AGC) which does this automatically, but the RTL is built to be cheap, not sophisticated. You can then run into a problem where you've eliminated the distortion, but now weaker stations are attenuated so much that they are below the receiver's noise floor and are thus unreceivable. This is called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desensitization_%28telecommunications%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">desensitization</a>. The range between the noise floor and clipping is called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">dynamic range</a>, and is sometimes specified as a figure of merit for receivers.</p>

<p>A better solution is to use a higher resolution ADC. If you had a 16 bit ADC, you could only go up to 0xFFFF. With a 32 bit ADC, you can go up to 0xFFFFFFFF. That means the peak signal can be higher before you run into clipping. See <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/q/607/218"">SDR sampling bandwidth - do the bits per sample matter?</a></p>

"How does DAB radio garbled noise come about?","139","","<p>I'm a sound designer and I'm interested in using/simulating that effect of DAB radio when you have a low signal/interference, where voices become garbled, bubbling, burbling, broken up, etc. I wondered if someone could explain how the specific sonic qualities of that type of noise arise from digital radio algorithms?</p>

<p>My knowledge base is in digital signal processing, but not in any theory of radio codecs etc., so I'd find it really useful if you could give me an explanation that references general audio operations but not the deep technicalities of radio processes. For instance, my initial hypothesis is that it somehow arises out of extreme sudden jumps in bitrate: does that come close to the truth at all?</p>
","<p>I'm not familiar with the DAB system in particular, but I can give you a conceptual answer which I think you will find useful.</p>

<p>In analog radio, things are straightforward. The lower the signal-to-noise ratio, the more the received signal deviates from the transmitted one, and that deviation from ideality in the RF signal results in some closely related deviation in the demodulated audio — the details depending on the modulation used. But, critically, this is on an instantaneous basis; that is, you could plot the original audio, modulated RF signal, signal received with noise, and demodulated audio on a single graph with a common time axis and there would be a consistent relationship. Therefore, since RF noise (that is not deliberate interference) is generally random from instant to instant, so is the effect on the audio.</p>

<p>In digital radio using an audio codec, this time relationship does not hold, so more complex effects are possible because the influence of noise can cause loss or modification of portions of the audio in a consistent way over a longer time interval.</p>

<p>(It would be <em>possible</em> to send a digital audio signal while preserving the time relationship — for example, using a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Stream_Digital"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DSD</a> bitstream, or using a modulation with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol_rate"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">multiple bits per symbol</a> to send an entire <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-code_modulation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PCM</a> sample value at once. However, since it is neither compressed nor error-corrected, it would be very inefficient.)</p>

<p>Generally speaking, an audio codec attempts to represent digital audio using fewer bits than would be taken by the numbers that are the original sample values. This necessarily makes some assumptions about the structure of the signal — that it contains something like voice or music. Therefore, <strong>if you put random or corrupted data into the decoding process, it is <em>more likely</em> to generate something that we would call “garble” rather than “noise”, just as a matter of statistics.</strong></p>

<p>Also, digital radio usually makes use of error-detecting (and error-correcting) codes. This means that it is possible for the receiver to <em>know</em> when it is receiving corrupted data, and make a decision about what to do instead. This could be as simple as playing silence instead, but a better option for short interruptions is to proceed using the previous data. Since the decoder is in some sense <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthesizer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>synthesizing</em></a> its output, it can just keep doing that, generating the same waveform for longer than intended (as opposed to literally reusing old samples, which creates an obvious glitch as anyone who's listened to a CD skip knows). This is another way you get garble — you're listening to realistic voice sounds being held for longer than makes sense.</p>

<p>Furthermore, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_broadcasting#Audio_codec"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">according to Wikipedia</a>, DAB uses an “unequal error protection (UEP)” scheme, which means that the error-correction is biased towards preserving aspects of the encoded audio considered more critical.</p>

<p>So your idea of “jumps in bitrate” is somewhat close to the actual situation: it's a change in how many <em>good</em> bits the decoder has available to it, and it compensating as best it can. And in particular, the use of UEP means that a weak signal is more similar to an intentionally lower bitrate than it would be without UEP.</p>

"Does the wire/conductor size of all the elements affect antenna bandwidth?","138","","<p>Does the wire diameter of the reflector and the directors of a beam antenna affect the bandwidth or is it <strong>only</strong> the driven element diameter that has this effect?</p>
","<p>This is a non-mathematical answer.</p>

<p>The only difference between the driven and non-driven elements is the connection of a feedline.  Each of the elements resonance and position contribute to the characteristics of the antenna.</p>

<p>If the directors and reflectors are not of similar bandwidth to the driven element then they will not have a consistent phase and amplitude relationship with the driven element over the frequency range.  The radiation pattern depends on the summation of the energy from each of the elements.  The radiation pattern will change.</p>

<p>Given that there's a <a href=""http://www.ncdxf.org/beacon/intro.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">beacon network</a> which provides good information about how signals are traveling in various bands, it seems like it should be possible to create a transceiver that listens for the beacons, then chooses a suitable band for communication to a user-specified location.  If the receiver has a similar radio, it too would see similar conditions, and assuming it was set up knowing the location of the first transceiver it could probably choose the same band.</p>

<p>With some additional pre-setup (agreed on specific frequencies inside each band) and a few attempts at communicating, it seems like one could design such a radio that would essentially automate the process an operator would go through, trying to contact a specific station, and have good chances of making it on one of the available HF frequencies.</p>

<p>Is this possible, or are there problems that would prevent such an approach working?  Assuming proper identification is used, and probably using digital modes to do the searching are there legal problems to having the radio perform a quick automated search, or does the operator have to have more direct control over the transmissions?</p>

<p>Essentially what I'd like is an automated station that, given a few minutes, can often find a path to a distant receiver to provide the desired long-distance, always available communications without advanced training and significant effort each contact would normally require.</p>

<p>And the revere question, can I use an APRS tracker in Europe/Austria with the call sign issued, for example in the Cambodia ?</p>
","<p>The actual answer is a bit complicated and depends on a lot of things.</p>

<p>In general, the answer is no, with exceptions, but the number of exceptions can be large, due to bilateral or multilateral agreements.</p>

<p>In Europe, one of the most popular treaties is the <a href=""http://www.erodocdb.dk/docs/doc98/official/pdf/TR6101.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CEPT recommendation T/R 61-01</a>. Read the actual file for details, but in general, if you're within the CEPT area, you'll need to add the prefix for each country, but your own call-sign would remain the same and you'd just need the CEPT license, if you have the class 1 license in Austria. Don't forget that some countries still want Morse code exam for their license. </p>

<p>Also, prefixes can get a bit complicated if you're using a device which limits the number of characters in the callsign for APRS.</p>

<p>Things get a bit more complicated once you leave the CEPT area, that is to say, when you leave Russia. In general, you'd need to check if each country (you didn't list them, so...) has some sort of bilateral agreement with Austria and see how it would go to get an amateur license in that country. In case of some countries, you might get a short-time license with prefix plus your own callsign, like DL/XX1YYY in case of Germany, while in others you might need to get a real local callsign. This can also get a bit complicated, if the foreign administration wants to go into details of your examination, has requirements on how long you need to be in the country and so on. For example, in some countries, if you're Norwegian, and have an Austrian callsign, your Austrian license won't get recognized, but a Norwegian license would have been. Don't forget about the recognition paperwork and the potential fees that could be quite high. Some countries might also charge frequency usage fees as well.</p>

<p>In the opposite case, situation is a bit worse: You'd need to get your Cambodian license recognized in your European country and then hope that they will issue you a CEPT license, so you can use the CEPT license in Europe.   </p>

<p>Also, don't forget that APRS only works if you have good APRS coverage, so don't forget to take that into account!</p>

"Satelite dish modified for Wi-Fi (Signal Elevation Question)","137","","<p>I am doing a project where I will be re-purposing an old TV satellite dish as a directional Wi-Fi antenna. The dish is circular in shape, not oval.  The dish has an arm coming from the bottom that makes a 90 degree angle with the dish. I will be adding a second arm to the end of the dish's arm that will allow me to mount an SMA antenna connected with RG-59 cable precisely where it will utilize the dish's geometry. <strong>I need to figure out the proper position of the antenna on the dish.</strong> I want the dish to receive signal directionally where there is a zero signal elevation angle.  From my previous understanding, dishes receive their signal from space where there is an angle of elevation from the transmitter and the receiver part of the dish.</p>

<p>PS:I just realized that the 75 ohm impedance of the RG-59 cable is not optimal for the Wi-Fi adapter.  I only need about 6 inches of cable so I will try it with and without the jumper cable and compare signal levels.</p>
","<p>Unfortunately, your drawing is not correct.</p>

<p>To find the focal point of a symmetric parabola, measure the diameter of the open rim of the dish, call this D. Measure the depth of the dish at its center, call this c.</p>

<p>Calculate the focal point distance from the bottom of the dish as:</p>

<p>$$ f = \frac{D^2}{16c} $$</p>

<p>Note that the focal point is in the center of the dish, it is not offset as in your drawing. So your receive antenna will slightly shadow aperture of the dish.</p>

<p>Due to the physical aperture of your receive antenna, you may need to adjust it in or out from the focal point in order to fully illuminate the dipole or other element.</p>

<p>If the dish is an asymmetric parabola, the focal point will be offset from the center in order to avoid blocking the aperture. This is the type of parabola that nearly all modern home satellite dishes use. They are identified by an LNA support arm that extends from the bottom of the dish and the dish apparent elevation angle appears to be lower than the satellite capture elevation.</p>

<p>In the case of an asymmetric dish, the existing LNA arm should be used as a starting point to find the appropriate focal point for the dipole or other antenna element since the focal point is largely frequency independent.</p>

The noise may not even be at the frequency it appears in the waterfall: nonlinearities and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermodulation"">intermodulation</a> can make signals appear at frequencies where they actually are not. Sometimes you can identify these spurious signals by changing the LO frequency of your receiver and noticing how the signals move.

"How do contest multipliers work?","133","","<p>Example, a recent contest offered a multiplier for ""All 50 states"".  I presume that means I have to get all 50 states to get the multiplier.  However, nowhere does it list what to multiply by?  I'm very confused and googling around just hasn't been any help.  I've been just submitting my logs only claiming the QSOs and never a multiplier because I have no idea when I'm eligible to claim one.</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong></p>

<p>Example of unclear contest rules: <a href=""http://ncjweb.com/NAQP-Rules.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ncjweb.com/NAQP-Rules.pdf</a></p>
","<p>Usually if a contest says there are multipliers for ""all 50 states"" (and we have to assume this is US States? Without specifying a country or the actual contest we have to guess), that would mean that you would get one multiplier for each State worked (although what about DC? Presumably doesn't count as a mult?).</p>

<p>This would mean that the maximum number of multipliers would be 50 - one for each state worked.</p>

<p>Again - please specify more information. When saying ""in a recent contest"", it doesn't hurt to say which one it was :)</p>

<p>If you are asking how multipliers work generally, they are numbers that you collect as you are going. When you have worked out the score (you will get a number of points for contacts as specified in the rules of the contest), and the number of multipliers (again, specified in the rules of the contest), you multiply the numbers together to give you your final score.</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>Since you have now posted an example, I will quote from that PDF: ""Multiply total valid contacts by the sum of the number of multipliers worked on each band.""</p>

<p>That means that each 'valid contact' (defined in the PDF) is worth one point. The total number of contacts would then be multiplied by the number of multipliers <strong>on each band</strong>, where the allowed bands are ""160, 80, 40, 20, 15, 10 meters only, except no 160 meters for the RTTY contest"". The number of multipliers per band is given as 63 (50 states and 13 Canadian provinces). This gives a total number of 378 possible multipliers (6 bands x 63 states/provinces), and 315 for the RTTY contest.</p>

<p>So if you worked 10 stations on all 6 bands, but they were all in the same state/province, you would have 60 valid contacts and 6 multipliers, giving 360 points.</p>

<p>Of course, the cheat's way of doing all this is to use the EXCELLENT contest logging software by N1MM, where you enter each QSO as you work them, and it does the scoring for you.</p>

","<p>You want <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>all</em> the frequencies</a>?</p>

<p>Below that are frequencies usually called ""light"". Your eyes have some of that covered. The infrared and ultraviolet bits will need specialized cameras.</p>

<p>Around 300 GHz electromagnetic radiation tends to stop being called light and start being called ""radio waves"". What you are describing sounds exactly like a spectrum analyzer, and specifically one with a very wide bandwidth. Expect to pay a lot of money.

<p>You can go a little cheaper with an SDR, which can also have a waterfall display if you don't need the precise calibration and whatnot that comes with a spectrum analyzer.

<p>However, everything I find talking about it is in reference to 10m band and lower frequencies. Is choking necessary for the 2/70 bands?</p>
","<p>The article you reference has to do with protecting the controller in a screwdriver antenna. Which you don't have at VHF or UHF.</p>

<p>The purpose of a screwdriver antenna is to lengthen or shorten the element to match the wavelength of your transmission band. VHF and UHF transmission bands are each wider than a single HF band but not wider than all of the HF bands grouped together. At VHF and UHF frequencies the ideal antenna length between the ends of the band is not that great.</p>

<p>A feedline choke can be installed on any antenna but unless you are planning on driving a wire brush you're not going to get much induced current in your feed line.</p>

<p>You don't mention what type of antenna you have or where on the truck you are mounting it. However as the linked article in the comment explains you will be fully unbalanced. Mobile installation is almost always fully unbalanced.</p>

<p>Trucks have some suboptimal  mounting locations. They are not worse than motorcycles however. Accessories that you might have for your truck will change the below information. Which is for a regular  Pickup. The main things that impact the information below would be a ladder rack or a metal cover. </p>

<p>Best: If you are planning on through hole mounting to the center of your roof deck, the ground plane will be physically established where the connector comes through the roof. If you are just planning on the one antenna you should try to get it close to the center front back left right. This would be an effort to maximize the amount of ground plane around the antenna, and to minimize the amount of directivity that the shape of your ground plane will provide your signal.</p>

<p>Good: If you are using a magmount, the ground plane is parasitic back to the radio chassis mount. A similar mounting point to the one above should be chosen. Route the cable in such a way that water won't drip in and it won't get smashed by the door as often.</p>

<p>Okay: Stake hole mounts I don't have a great deal of experience with. If you use the holes close to the cab these run into the same issues as a trunk mount car antenna. The metal structure of the cab drastically interferes with your radiation pattern and your match.  If you have a full size pickup the rear stake holes will be more than a wavelength from the cab at 2m however you will still get Reflections from it. </p>

"Tuning a wire antenna by folding","131","","<p>Last weekend we tuned a quad loop for 80 m and 40 m. Instead of cropping, we folded the isolated wire using cable ties as shown in the picture below.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/shxd7.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/shxd7.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>After folding several quite large sections of the wire, we got the SWR under 1.2, so this approach seems to work. However, I do not understand the theoretical background, because the wire itself has still the same length and because it is isolated there is no electrical contact and the current has to flow over the same distance. Of course, this approach has an influence on the radiation pattern, but I do not see the direct influence on the resonance.</p>

<ul>
<li>Why does this have an influence on the standing wave?</li>
<li>Is the result equivalent to cropping a section of the same length? Can we now just remove the excessive part and solder the wire directly and get the same result?</li>
<li>Are there any disadvantages of folding instead of cropping, e.g. a lower radiation efficiency?</li>
</ul>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Why does this have an influence on the standing wave?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although there is no electrical connection between the folded sections at DC, that analysis neglects effects that are relevant at RF. Imagine a voltage step initiated at the feedpoint. It's important to consider not just the voltage at some point on the wire, but the fields <em>around</em> the wire.</p>

<p>Let's assume this is a dipole: as a positive voltage step is propagating down one half, a negative voltage step is propagating down the other half. <em>Between</em> these halves is a changing electrical field.</p>

<p>Furthermore, this voltage step will be accompanied with some change to current as well, and associated with this current is a magnetic field around the wire.</p>

<p>When the wavefront in the field reaches the folded section, the folded back section of the antenna isn't really ""isolated"" from the rest of the antenna. Indeed, the insulation provides no DC connectivity between the sections, but each wire in the folded section is within these electric and magnetic fields. Through laws like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday%27s_law_of_induction"" rel=""noreferrer"">Faraday's law of induction</a>, and more generally <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations"" rel=""noreferrer"">Maxwell's equations</a>, these fields mean the components of the folded section interact.</p>

<p>For a simpler case, consider a capacitor. A capacitor is two plates, separated by an insulator. At DC they are isolated, but in any circuit where current or voltage is changing, the interaction of the plates through the electric field becomes relevant.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is the result equivalent to cropping a section of the same length? Can we now just remove the excessive part and solder the wire directly and get the same result?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not exactly. Because the wires in the folded section are near each other and thus tightly coupled through their mutual electric and magnetic fields, the wavefront can just propagate over the folded section at the speed of light.</p>

<p>However, that folded section has a different impedance than a plain wire. You might consider each pair of wires a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_line"" rel=""noreferrer"">transmission line</a>, which might be open on one end, or shorted. In other words, a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stub_(electronics)"" rel=""noreferrer"">stub</a>. The impedance of these stubs might be negligible, depending on the particular folding. But in no case is it strictly correct to say simply cropping the antenna is equivalent.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are there any disadvantages of folding instead of cropping, e.g. a lower radiation efficiency?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's very difficult to say. You might look at loading coils and electrically shortened antennas for a more common case where this is a concern. As a very blunt guess, I'd say if the amount of folding is small relative to the overall size of the antenna, losses will be negligible.</p>

<li>There are several undocumented fields, including CA_PROVINCE, US_STATE, SIGNDATA, and SIGN_LOTW_V1.0. SIGNDATA is the data signed for the LOTW signature, SIGN_LOTW_V1.0 is the LOTW signature itself. CA__PROVINCE and US_STATE are the Canadian Province and US state.</li>

"Multiple simultaneous tunings with SDR","129","","<p>I just found out about <a href=""http://www.websdr.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">WebSDR</a>, and I was wondering how is it possible that many listeners listen and tune to different stations simultaneously. Which components/technologies allow this, and how does this roughly work?</p>
","<p>Software-defined radio is radio where the signals are sampled and converted to digital data early in the process. This means that like any digital data, they can be copied without loss of quality. Computers can execute the same calculation many times. Thus, a SDR program can take one input and process it <em>differently</em>, as if it were many different radios.</p>

<p>That's the fundamental concept. However, making this work still requires you to have the digital signal you need — all of the hardware which works in the analog domain, gathering the radio waves and converting them into a digital signal, must be able to <em>simultaneously</em> receive everything everyone wants.</p>

<p>This turns out to not be hard at all with modern electronics. Every radio signal has some <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_(signal_processing)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bandwidth</a> — some <em>range</em> of frequencies which it occupies. (A signal at exactly one frequency conveys no information.) SDR receiver hardware takes the signal and converts it to digital samples using <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_rate"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a sampling rate that is high enough to preserve the entire bandwidth</a>. If you take a receiver capable of receiving a wide-bandwidth signal and tune it to where several narrower (and closer spaced) signals are present, the digital signal resulting contains <em>all</em> of those signals, at different frequencies within itself.</p>

<p>Such a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency-division_multiplexing"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">multiplexed</a> signal is then processed in software using digital versions of the same components that an analog radio would — mixers, filters, and demodulators — to extract individual signals.</p>

<p>A multi-user software-defined radio simply has to run a differently-configured copy of those components for each user.</p>

<p>Then the only remaining matter is that the receiver hardware is capable of bringing in a signal of enough bandwidth and sample rate to contain all the users' desired tunings. This is <em>exactly the same technology</em> as enables high data rate digital wireless communications — <strong>high sampling rate ADCs</strong> to convert those digital signals.</p>

<hr>

<p>The other element of such an SDR is a antenna suitable for receiving the entire bandwidth. Generally, <em>any</em> antenna <em>can</em> be used for receiving across a wide bandwidth, but the signal level will be much weaker away from the optimal frequencies.</p>

<p>For “higher” bands (VHF and up), a single antenna of ordinary design can do the job, just as antennas for scanners do.</p>

<p>Receivers for all of HF, like <a href=""http://websdr.ewi.utwente.nl:8901/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the University of Twente WebSDR</a>, take the approach of using a physical antenna that is, loosely speaking, equally bad at all frequencies of interest, followed by a built-in amplifier (LNA) to increase the signal level for the receiver — most famously in this context, the PA0RDT “Mini-Whip” design.</p>

<p>Note that “all of HF” is just 30 MHz, which is not that much these days. A single Wi-Fi signal can occupy 40 MHz.</p>

","<p>Some information, since you asked for comments:</p>

<p>1) your rhombic isn't working properly. It shouldn't have a double beam like that, it should have a single forward beam. Something about the proportions is wrong.</p>

<p>You can and should design a rhombic from formulas, and only simulate at the end. It's a well understood antenna, there is good design data for it.</p>

<p>It needs a termination resistor at the end away from your feed. It's not showing in your model. This needs to be non-inductive, which is tricky for 2m, possibly made of a hundred quarter-watt resistors in series and parallel.</p>

<p>2) as they are usually built, rhombics are horizontally polarised. The repeater is almost certainly vertical. You need to tilt it up on edge to make it vertical. The masts that support it, both the the middle and at the front, must be non-conductive.</p>

<p>3) You're simulating over a ground plane, which is appropriate for HF because it's so intimately involved in the antenna fields. For a VHF antenna 25' up, the ground doesn't matter. You should remove the ground and simulate the antenna in free space. The ground will get involved later, a hundred metres away, but it affects all antennas equally.</p>

<p>4) consider a yagi instead. The main features of rhombics are their simple construction, limited number of supports, and wide bandwidth to cover many bands. This makes them attractive for HF when you have a lot of space. They have reasonably good gain, but nothing like a yagi. Do some digging for information about the gain of a yagi and compare. For example, you can easily make a yagi for 2m from an old broomstick and some fencing wire / welding rods, that will give you about 10 dBi, which is at least 13 to 16 dB more than your handheld antenna yields. If you want a lot of gain, look up the Rope Yagi, which can be made very long.</p>

<p>If I'm operating an SDR, what clues can I look for that would indicate a swapped I and Q?</p>
","<p>Swapping I and Q reverses all the frequencies. For example, a signal 5 kHz above the mixer's LO will appear at -5 kHz, instead of 5kHz. CW and AM are symmetrical in the frequency domain, so it doesn't matter for the purposes of demodulation, though your software is likely to display the wrong frequency. SSB is not: reversing I and Q will make USB look like LSB, and LSB look like USB.</p>

<p>If you have a waterfall with lower frequencies on the left, then tuning to a higher frequency should shift everything to the left. If it goes to the right instead, you know I and Q are reversed.</p>

"Can IMAP email be used for packet radio?","127","","<p>I just barely learned that IMAP is a protocol that allows you to read and respond to emails without using the internet. Would it be possible to use this application for packet radio and if so, how? I am using the Ubuntu 14.10 operating system. </p>
","<p>IMAP is a protocol for transferring email, nothing more, nothing less.  It typically uses TCP/IP as the underlying protocol, but it <em>could</em> be routed over something else (like packet radio).

(You could even configure that mailserver to bridge to the internet, but keep in mind that you'd be responsible for any incoming traffic that made it onto amateur frequencies!)</p>

"How does inductive base loading cause low feedpoint impedance in verticals?","127","","<p>As an extreme example, take mobile HF antennas. These can have very low feedpoint impedances, maybe as low as $6\Omega$. The ideal impedance of a quarter/wave vertical is $36\Omega$, but electrically lengthening it makes the impedance go down. How's that work?</p>
","<p>The ideal $36\Omega$ comes from the fact that a vertical is 1/2 dipole (so 1/2 of $72\Omega$). </p>

<p>If you shorten a dipole (shorter than 1/2$\lambda$, the resistive part of the antenna will lessen, and the antenna will get more capacitive. You could see this on a Smith chart, or from the impedance formulas.</p>

<p>Then, if you eliminate the capacitive part, by adding an inductor in series you get only the resistive part. Remember, a capacitor + inductor in series, at resonance are a short-circuit.</p>

<p>There's a catch though: if the resistive part is so low, the resistance of the inductor (copper!) will start heating up because of the high currents, and you'll loose part of your power through heat, unless you use really thick wire.
The same, high, current must also be managed by the ground-plane.</p>

<p>That's also why AM stations, which can only afford a fraction of the tower they'd need, have to use a really effective ground-plane to handle such large currents. ELF stations are build near large - preferably salty - water surfaces to have a reflector able to handle 1000's of A.</p>

<p>This reasoning is slightly simplified to make it clear enough to make it understandable, I hope.</p>

"Is using an HT and walking considered mobile?","127","","<p>I've seen many contests define mobile as something like being able to legally move and broadcast. Well, using an HT while walking I can legally move. Does this count as mobile contacts for a contest?</p>
","<p>Insofar as there is an agreed-upon definition of the term “mobile” (and “portable”, which is closely related/confusable and so I'm covering it here), this is how I have most frequently seen the terms used <em>when people are being precise about it</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Portable</strong>: A station set up in a temporary location.</p>

<li><p><strong>Mobile</strong>: A station which is <em>capable</em> of being operated <em>while in motion</em>.</p>

"What is dB(μV/m), and what are its applications?","127","","<p>Many radio coverage tools yield results in dB(μV/m). For example, <a href=""http://lrcov.crc.ca/main/"" rel=""noreferrer"">CRC-COVWEB</a> or nearly any tool based on the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longley%E2%80%93Rice_model"" rel=""noreferrer"">Longly-Rice model</a>.</p>

<p>The unit occurs in regulations sometimes as well. For example, <a href=""http://www.arrl.org/the-fcc-s-new-rf-exposure-regulations#table1"" rel=""noreferrer"">maximum permissible exposure</a> limits may be given in V/m, which seems like a similar unit.</p>

<p>What's a dB(μV/m)? How is it defined? I'd like to see some math.</p>

<p>And why use it, instead of some other more familiar unit?</p>
","<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> $\frac{V}{m}$ and $\text{dB}(\mu V/m)$ are units for the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_strength"" rel=""noreferrer"">field strength of an electric field</a>. For a practical application skip to the end!</p>

<p><strong>Derivation of the field strength</strong></p>

<p>A point charge $q_1$ generates a field strength* of $E = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}{q_1\over r^2}$ at a distance of $r$. </p>

<p>This is derived from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb&#39;s_law"" rel=""noreferrer"">Coulomb's law</a> that is $F=\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}{q_1q_2\over r^2}$ giving the force acting on two charges $q_1$ and $q_2$ at a distance of $r$. It can be rewritten as</p>

<p>$F=q_2 \cdot \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}{q_1\over r^2}=q_2\cdot E$ or the other way around $E = \frac{F}{q_2}$</p>

<p>So from the field strength $E$ we can calculate the force on a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_particle#Test_particles_in_plasma_physics_or_electrodynamics"" rel=""noreferrer"">test charge</a> of $q_2$ by multiplication.</p>

<p>Now for the units. If we have a test charge of $q_2 = 1\,C$ that experiences a force of $F = 1\,N$, we get a field strength of $E = \frac{F}{q_2} = \frac{1\,N}{1\,C} = 1\,\frac{N}{A\cdot s} = 1\,\frac{N\cdot m}{A\cdot s\cdot m} = 1 \frac{V}{m}$.</p>

<p><sub>* I use the scalar form and assume all amounts have the same sign and direction for simplicity.</sub></p>

<p><strong>Decibel</strong></p>

<p>But your actual question was about $\text{dB}(\mu V/m)$, but that is just a numerical transformation to get values that are easier to calculate with in real world applications, because the values are usually very small. $0\,\text{dB}(\mu V/m)$ corresponds to $1 \frac{\mu V}{m}$ and that is $10^{-6} \frac{\mu V}{m}$.</p>

<p>So this is a usual <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel"" rel=""noreferrer"">decibel conversion</a>. For example to get the field strength in $\frac{V}{m}$ for $45\,\text{dB}(\mu V/m)$ we calculate</p>

<p>$E = 10^{-6} \frac{V}{m} \cdot 10^\frac{45}{20} = 178 \cdot 10^{-6} \frac{V}{m}$</p>

<p>The 20, because $E$ is a field quantitiy and not a power quantity.</p>

<p><strong>From field strength to reception power</strong></p>

<p>Now we know what $\text{dB}(\mu V/m)$ is. Its main advantage is that it specifies the properties of the electic field without the need to take the reception antenna or the receiver into account!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it does not help a lot for radio transmission, because we usually do not receive with force meters attached to probe charges, but antennas and receivers ;-)</p>

<p>This transformation to get the reception power is not straightforward, because it highly depends on the antenna and other parameters, but I can give an approximative calculation. For this we need the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_impedance#Wave_impedance_in_free_space"" rel=""noreferrer"">wave impedance in free space</a> $Z_0 = \sqrt{\frac{\mu_0} {\varepsilon_0}}$. With this we get the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_power_density#Far_field"" rel=""noreferrer"">surface power density</a> in the far field of $S = \frac{E^2}{Z_0}$.</p>

<p>And with the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antenna_aperture"" rel=""noreferrer"">antenna aperture or effective area</a> $A_w$ that is for example $\frac{\lambda^2}{4\pi}$ for an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotropic_radiator"" rel=""noreferrer"">isotropic radiator</a> or $0.1305\, \lambda^2$ for a half wave dipole, where $\lambda$ is the wave length, we can then calculate the reception power</p>

<p>$P = S \cdot A_w = \frac{E^2}{Z_0} \cdot A_w$.</p>

<p><strong>Complete example</strong></p>

<p>Lets say we want to estimate the reception quality of the <a href=""http://www.db0zu.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">DB0ZU</a> repeater on the <a href=""http://m.osmtools.de/0gPSc2rITxB0fvuv2qvCi5"" rel=""noreferrer"">Zugspitze</a> at <a href=""http://m.osmtools.de/0gddC2rCTsB0goRC2rjZI5"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ohlstadt</a> in a distance of $30\,\text{km}$ with <a href=""https://www.outdooractive.com/de/wanderung/zugspitz-region/wanderung--zum-ohlstaedter-wasserfall/23107787/"" rel=""noreferrer"">a nice unobstructed view to the Zugspitze</a> (except for the cow). We assume a radiation power of $1\,W$ and a frequency of $145\,\text{MHz}$ ($\lambda = 2.07\,\text{m}$).</p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://lrcov.crc.ca/main/"" rel=""noreferrer"">CRC-COVWEB</a> we get $45\,\text{dB}(\mu V/m)$ in Ohlstadt. Look above for the calculation to get $178 \cdot 10^{-6} \frac{V}{m}$ from this. We can then calculate a surface power density of</p>

<p>$S = \frac{E^2}{Z_0} = \frac{\left(178 \cdot 10^{-6} \frac{V}{m}\right)^2}{377\,\Omega}$ <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(10%5E(45%2F20)*10%5E(-6)%20(V%2Fm))%5E2%2F(377%20Ohm)"" rel=""noreferrer"">$= 84\,\frac{pW}{m^2}$</a></p>

<p>Assuming we receive with a half wave dipole without further losses, we get a reception power of</p>

<p>$P = S \cdot A_w =  84 \frac{pW}{m^2} \cdot 0.1305\, \lambda^2 = 84 \frac{pW}{m^2} \cdot 0.1305\, (2.07\,\text{m})^2 $ <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(10%5E(45%2F20)*10%5E(-6)%20(V%2Fm))%5E2%2F(377%20Ohm)%20*%200.1305%20*%20%20(2.07%20meter)%5E2"" rel=""noreferrer"">$= 4.6 \cdot 10^{-11} W$</a> $=
-73\,\text{dBm}$. That is a nice S9+20 dB signal.</p>

<p>For an isotropic radiator we have to replace the 0.1305 with $\frac{1}{4\pi}$ and get $-75\,\text{dBm}$. This result is in line with <a href=""http://www.giangrandi.ch/electronics/anttool/rx-field.shtml"" rel=""noreferrer"">the calculator found here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Shortcut calculation</strong></p>

<p>All the calculations above can be combined resulting in a single formula.</p>

<p>$P_r \,(\text{dBm}) = E \,(\text{dB}\mu V/m) - 20 \cdot \log_{10}\,\, f \,(\text{MHz}) - 77.2$</p>

<p>So for our example:</p>

<p>$P_r = 45 - 20 \cdot \log_{10}(145) - 77.2 = -75\,\text{dBm}$.</p>

<p>This approach is taken from Christopher Haslett, ""Essentials of Radio Wave Propagation"", Cambridge University Press, 2008. Chapter 2 also provides some more explanation.</p>

<p><strong>Comparison with free space path loss</strong></p>

<p>Instead of using the CRC-COVWEB tool, we can also estimate this reception power of an isotropic radiator by using the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-space_path_loss#Free-space_path_loss_in_decibels"" rel=""noreferrer"">free space path loss model</a>. </p>

<p>$\mbox{FSPL(dB)} = 20\log_{10}(d) + 20\log_{10}(f) + 20\log_{10}\left(\frac{4\pi}{c}\right)$</p>

<p>Since there are no obstacles between the Zugspitze and Ohlstadt the result should be quite similar. And in fact,</p>

<p>$\mbox{FSPL(dB)} = 20\log_{10}(30\,\text{km}) + 20\log_{10}(145\,\text{MHz}) + 20\log_{10}\left(\frac{4\pi}{c}\right) = 105\,\text{dB}$</p>

<p>$1 W = 30\,\text{dBm}$, so the reception power is $-75\,\text{dBm}$.</p>

<p>I was able to copy the data from the radio without problems. I edited it in chirp, then sent it back to the radio. After cloning was finished the VX-8 restarted and started to behave in a strange manner. It was barely reacting to any input (be it keyboard or knob). The VFO A display showed something along the lines of <code>b1 30.303</code>, which I suppose might have been an error message of some kind, but I wasn't able to find any reference to it. The VFO B was set to the frequency I set it to before cloning and I wasn't able to change it by turning the knob. After a while the radio stopped reacting to the input entirely so I removed and reconnected the battery. Since then I wasn't able to power the radio on.</p>

<p>My question is, has this happened to anyone else, and if yes were they able to get the radio working on their own? Mine is still covered by the warranty, so I'll be posting it to the local distributor on Monday, but until then I could try other options, if anyone knows of any.</p>

"Build a HamRadio Friendly UMTS Module","125","","<p>I would like to play around with openBTS/yateBTS (experimental, no 24/7 run). What I would like to do is to modify a UMTS/GSM module or mobile phone so it operates in a frequency that can be used with a HAM license.</p>

<p>I looked around and think in my location, Austria, I can use this frequency because in my area there are no active hams that use ATV: 1272,0 – 1290,994 MHz.  Has anybody ever done this before? Does anybody know a good module or phone where this can be archived?</p>

<p>I first thought about just replacing the crystal and bypassing the filters, but i can't access them all, because some of them are in the chip. Another idea was to use a mixer to offset the output frequency and place filters behind this.</p>

<p>So the questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is it okay to use an ATV frequency when I am sure no other ham gets disturbed?</li>
<li>How should i modify an existing chip/mobile phone?</li>
<li>Is one of the ideas above good enough for experimental usage?</li>
</ul>
","<blockquote>
  <p>… to modify a UMTS/GSM module or mobile phone so it operates in a frequency that can be used with a HAM license.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That means you'll need external mixers – mobile chipsets are very well designed to filter exactly the frequencies relevant to exactly one standard, and you won't be able to change that.</p>

<p>With LTE, there's support for ISM-band operation in some newer chipsets (I'm not 100% about the specifics), and that also means that the Ham/ISM overlap might be usable here; also, there's LTE allocations in what's called <em>digitale dividende</em> in the German-speaking regions – the spectrum that was freed by shutting down the analog commercial TV stations.</p>

<p>But for GSM (where that filtering is even much more fine-granular) and UMTS, I'm afraid your only option is to use external down/upconverters to transform the downlink and uplink band of the chipset to whatever you want to use.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>How should i modify an existing chip/mobile phone?</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Not at all, add external uplink/downlink frequency transverters.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Is it okay to use an ATV frequency when I am sure no other ham gets disturbed?</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Probably not; I'm not an expert for legal details, but I think that usually these bands are meant for video communication, and doing something else on there isn't OK for the others.</p>

<p>Also note that GSM hops (or at least, the base station can configure itself and the mobiles to do so) over a large bandwidth – potentially much wider than a TV channel. UMTS channel widths are also configurable to exceed TV channel widths. I'd strongly recommend you do your first experiments within the confines of cabling!</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Is one of the ideas above good enough for experimental usage?</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Experimentation is always fun!</p>

<p>I don't know how much use it'll be, however. If you need to run around with a handset that is twice as large because you had to remove its original antenna, add two mixers and a diplexer and another antenna, and uses additional battery, you might really be better off with looking into getting an SDR-based LTE basestation running in the ISM bands to work with your handset. </p>

<p>Also note that cell phone and cellular infrastructure manufacturers have implemented standards that are <em>meant</em> to push the edge of ""state of the art"". That means that these devices' receivers are heavily optimized for a specific channel model – and channel models are frequency-dependent! You get very different problems when you do something e.g. on 1.8 GHz vs doing the same transmission on 146 MHz; however, 1272 MHz is probably a channel that ""might be similar enough"" and just work (make sure the analog parts of your cellular hardware aren't hit by TV broadcast powers – cell phones are easily a couple billion times more sensitive than TV sets).</p>

<p>Timing in cellular networks is also optimized so that a lot of people can participate in one cell. Thus, building e.g. a GSM network where maximum distances aren't really what you'd expect (a couple of kilometers), but signals are ""in flight"" for a lot longer, then you'd need to tweak parameters of that network – and it might happen that at some point, the hardware involved simply won't be able to accomodate a setting, or that the way the network operates makes no sense anymore.</p>

<p>UMTS might be an especially bad choice – it depends on code orthogonality, and that actually isn't the nicest assumption for wide-spanning networks or fast-moving communication partners, or reflectors (and that's one of the technical reasons it got superseeded by LTE). Also, I think there's more mature LTE than UMTS SDR implementations out there – have a look at <a href=""https://github.com/srsLTE/srsLTE"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/srsLTE/srsLTE</a></p>

If the radio is getting hit with both these frequencies at the same time, how is the antenna providing the voltages for just the one frequency that it is tuned to? It doesn't but then I'm not understanding how an antenna can receive multiple frequencies at the same time. Seems it would be just a jumble.</p>
","<p><strong>Filters.</strong></p>

<p>A filter is a circuit which is designed to react differently depending on the frequency. Every real (not mathematically ideal) circuit element does this to some degree, but filters are designed to have a very specific <em>frequency response</em>.</p>

<p>Here's a <em>very</em> loose and incomplete high-level schematic of a simple radio receiver:</p>



<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zT24s.png"" alt=""schematic""></p>



<p><sup><a href=""/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fzT24s.png"">simulate this circuit</a> &ndash; Schematic created using <a href=""https://www.circuitlab.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">CircuitLab</a></sup></p>

<p>As you can see, the filter has four terminals: two for the input from the antenna, and two for the output to the demodulator. (In practice, they might more likely share a single ground bus for both input and output sides, for a total of three terminals.)</p>

<p>The effect of the filter is that the part of the signal coming from the antenna which has the desired frequency passes through — as if the wires on the left were connected to the wires on the right — and the rest of it does not — as if the wires on the left were either shorted together or disconnected.</p>

<p>Filters can be made out of various components, but most commonly inductors and capacitors. Introductions to electronic circuits often say something like “capacitors pass AC and block DC; inductors block AC and pass DC"". This is true, but simplified; there is not just “AC” but the entire spectrum of possible frequencies, and the higher the frequency the <em>more</em> the capacitor will pass it and the inductor will block it. If you put an inductor and capacitor in parallel or in series, you get a circuit with a <em>resonant frequency</em> — a specific frequency (actually a small range of frequencies) which it will pass (or block) much more than other frequencies. That's the simplest filter. Additional complexity in filter design gets you ""sharper"" filters that are better at passing what you want and blocking what you don't want.</p>

<p>In addition, the antenna itself has frequency-varying characteristics and therefore acts as a filter. This is why there are different size antennas for different frequency ranges.</p>

<hr>

<p>The above is a very simple picture. The main thing that I've omitted (besides e.g. amplifiers, which every radio but a “crystal radio” has in order to produce an audible output volume) is <em>tuning</em>.</p>

<p>One approach to tuning is to adjust the filter's resonant frequency (or <em>passband</em>) to the frequency you want to receive. Early receivers (see <em>crystal radio</em> and <em>tuned radio frequency (TRF) receiver</em>) did use this technique. However, it is difficult to make a filter that is both adjustable and sharp enough to be good at receiving one station and not also an adjacent one (it has poor <em>selectivity</em>).</p>

<p>Instead, modern radios (starting with the <em>superheterodyne</em> design) internally generate a signal at a particular offset from the desired frequency (the <em>local oscillator</em> (LO)) which is combined with the signal from the antenna (<em>mixed</em>) in such a way as to produce a copy of the radio signal at a fixed frequency (<em>intermediate frequency</em> (IF), equal to the offset between the LO and the input) which is then filtered using a sharp non-adjustable filter before being passed to the demodulator.</p>

<p>Originally, the local oscillator was an adjustable filter (usually containing a variable capacitor and a fixed inductor) and amplifier connected in a positive feedback loop — the filter selects the particular frequency and the amplifier keeps the signal oscillating. (Here, the filter doesn't need to be especially sharp because it's handling only the fed-back signal — which will quickly settle on <em>only</em> the resonant frequency.) Modern radios instead use digital circuits to generate the local oscillator signal, via digital-to-analog converters (DAC) and phase-lock loops (PLL); this allows very precise tuning under computer control.</p>

"No stations on MW band at daytime","125","","<p>I have a portable radio which serves for FM / MW / SW bands. At nights I can listen to 4-6 international channels from different countries on MW. However, I am unable to tune them at daytime. Is it about my location as a result of earth's spin or there are other reasons that I don't know? Shutting down the radio station at nights comes to my mind but all the stations are from different (meridians) countries.</p>
","<p>During the day, the ionosphere is strengthened by direct exposure to the solar wind, making it thicker and lower relative to the Earth's surface. This prevents any sort of skip propagation at MW frequencies, limiting MW propagation to ground wave only, which only covers a limited range from the transmitter.</p>

<p>At night, the ionosphere is higher and more diffuse, allowing skip propagation to much longer distances.</p>

<p>These effects have been known for a long time, which is why most MW stations are required to reduce power at night in order to reduce interference with distant stations on the same frequency. Only designated ""clear-channel"" stations are permitted to continue to operate at full power.</p>

<p>For your game, if you need global broadcast, I'd use one of the global frequencies. If it is more local, use one of the regional frequencies that are around 3xxx kHz (80 m band) or 7xxx kHz (40 m band). 80m is good at nightime, 40m at daytime. Either one is regional, covering something like most of California.</p>

<p>The regions (<a href=""http://www.iaru.org/regions.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.iaru.org/regions.html</a>) are:</p>

<p>IARU Region 1: Europe, Africa, Middle East and Northern Asia</p>

<p>IARU Region 2: The Americas</p>

<p>IARU Region 3: Asia-Pacific</p>

<p>There are other frequencies for non-amateur use, mostly marine and aircraft. The primary marine distress frequency was 2182 kHz, but the US Coast Guard stopped monitoring that in 2013. Marine distress traffic now digital to satellites with GPS data.</p>

<p>This is a good list of those frequencies.</p>

<p>If you want a US-oriented throwback flavor, I'd go with the CONELRAD frequencies from the Cold War era. In case of a major attack, AM broadcast stations would shut down, with only specific stations on either 640 or 1240 kHz continuing to broadcast. Those frequencies were marked with a triangle-in-circle icon on radio dials.</p>

"Why are carrier waves necessary?","124","","<p>I am studying for the technician exam and I have come across the section on carrier waves, basebands, and various kinds of modulation.</p>

<p>It makes sense to me that you create a signal by combining the baseband, which carries data, with the carrier signal (a sine wave of some kind) before transmitting.</p>

<p>My question is - why? What would stop us from just transmitting the raw data (voice or whatever) as it is? My guess is that ""voice"" frequencies for example are in the range of 300hz - 3000hz and we need to ""boost"" them up to the frequency we are on (for example 167.000 MHz). However this is just a guess.</p>
","<p>The simplest answer is that the modulating signal, while it could be electromagnetic, will not have the desired propagation characteristics to carry out effective communications. By mixing the modulating signal with the carrier, the resulting signal has a much higher frequency that results in the desired propagation effects.</p>

<p>Hams often find that they cannot make their desired contacts on a given band (short frequency range) so they switch bands in the hope of making a contact. The modulating signal stays the same but the carrier frequency is dramatically changed as they switch bands.</p>

<p>Having the ability to change the carrier frequency also helps to avoid interfering signals or talk with another ham by tuning to their transmitting frequency.</p>

"Do stub matching techniques still produce some loss?","123","","<p>I am using a double stacked Yagi-Uda antenna with about 57 Ω impedance. The 50 Ω feed line (coaxial) cables are combined using a tee connector. I observed, at the output of the tee connector, an impedance of about 28 Ω while transmission and hence I used a single short-end stub matching technique to transform this impedance into 50 Ω at the transceiver end.</p>

<p>Neglecting the practical terms such as attenuation, will this technique still cause reflections at the tee connector output? The wave shall see 28 Ω again from the stub to the tee connector output, so wouldn't there be a reflection again? </p>
","<p>Yes, you have correctly analyzed the situation, and there will be reflections. But you ask if there will be any <em>loss</em>.</p>

<p>Reflections don't cause loss directly; they just traverse the same piece of transmission line many times and the loss in the line adds up. (Or to take a sum-of-all-the-reflections perspective: They cause increased current in the transmission line (relative to what's going in and out the ends), and therefore additional loss due to resistance.)</p>

<p>Another effect of reflections is to add a time delay to part of the signal, like multipath, <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/q/2297/76"">but this rarely matters</a>, and it is not loss per se — all the energy in still goes out.</p>

<p>So, “neglecting the practical terms such as attenuation”, there is no loss, but in practice there is. You can reduce the coax loss by minimizing the length between the stub and tee, of course.</p>

<p>What would theoretically make sense here is a tee with two 50 Ω ports and one 25 Ω port, but those don't exist since they'd need specialized connectors. Instead, you would build a custom matching circuit which just keeps everything inside as short as possible or, for higher frequencies, has <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microstrip"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">impedance-matched PCB traces</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Note that what you're effectively building here is a <em>power divider</em> (a.k.a. splitter in cable-TV land). Therefore, you could purchase it as a standard part instead of building your own, and it would be already designed to minimize reflections and loss. Then the worst problem you'd have is the 57 Ω - 50 Ω mismatch.</p>

What do I need to know about contests before getting a technician license for the first time? Is there any particular etiquette regarding them I should know?</p>
","<p>There are all kinds of contests. Operators attempt to get the most contacts, the best contacts, or some combination. The scoring metrics are set by the contest organizer, who is usually some amateur radio club or organization.</p>

<p>There isn't a lot you need to know about them to get your license. When there's a contest, bands in which that contest applies can be very busy with a lot of people. You should be prepared to either <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/q/1132/218"">avoid this activity</a>, or participate in it. If you don't participate in the contest you can still make contacts with people who are, but be aware that contest operators won't be interested in chatting (they are going for quantity, not conversation). They will want to exchange a minimum of information which is set by the contest rules to make the contact valid. Rules vary, but usually exchanged are:</p>

<ul>
<li>call sign</li>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maidenhead_Locator_System"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Maidenhead locator</a></li>
<li>signal report (which is always 599 to make things easier)</li>
</ul>

<p>Contest rules usually require this information to be reported somehow for verification by the contest organizer. Again, methods vary from contest to contest, but some form of electronic submission is common. There are plenty of contest logging programs available to help with the task. Some contests require that both parties of the contest submitted matching log entries for a valid contact to make submitting false contacts harder.</p>

"How do I notify and publish information on experimental modes?","122","","<p>I'm considering tinkering with a new mode.  Of course I'll stick to experimental channels and low power for now, but as people notice my transmissions they won't immediately understand what is being transmitted.</p>

<p>Do I have to disseminate that information before I start my testing, or can I do the testing, finalize the design, then publish?  What I'm worried about here is that as the mode evolves and changes, keeping already published information up to date is time consuming, and I'd rather publish a little overview, do the work until it's complete, then publish the final details.</p>
","<p>Back, before the Internet, the documents were published in magazines, conference papers and such – well after the protocols were designed and initial tests were done.</p>

<p>In some cases CWID (transmitting callsign using CW every now and then) has been used to make sure the transmissions are well identified even if the actual data is a bit hard to decode.</p>

<p>Nowadays, I think, people usually just experiment quite freely and publish when they have something ready.</p>

<p>If you're really worried, you can always do testing transmissions with a dummy load, keeping the radiated power so low that it cannot be considered a licensed transmission at all. After all, you can generally transmit on any frequency, any power, as long as you don't radiate that energy. If you're tinkering with a new mode, it might actually be easiest to do it using a <strong>simulated predictably noisy multipath software environment</strong> without initially involving real radios at all!</p>

<p>Publication method ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Set up a blog or wiki site</strong>, let people know roughly which frequencies you're using, your callsign, and some general information about the mode.</li>
<li><strong>Open Source</strong> is the hip thing to do nowadays. Consider pushing your development code on Github or some other similar code repository - that's what I do myself. Your current code serves as pretty definite documentation as it is. As an added bonus you get an off-site backup of your code, and it might even attract other developers to help out.</li>

"Influence of bending and asymetric ground wire on monopole antenna","122","","<p>I'm currently building a rc radio system using the 433mhz RFM69W transceiver, so far everything works fine, but i am not sure about the way i laid out my antenna and how the layout cripples the efficiency of it.
(The connection is stable up to 400m to 600m with a building in between at ~13dbm output power)</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pEFLf.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pEFLf.png"" alt=""this is a crude but very accurate drawing of the layout""></a></p>

<p>And would it make a big difference at all?</p>
","<p>I'm not experienced with RC systems, but on general antenna design principles:</p>

<ul>
<li>The bend is fine. It's too small a feature to have much effect.</li>
<li>The “ground” wire (really better described as a second antenna element) is fine. The antenna will radiate better in the direction that wire runs than others.</li>
</ul>

<p>The biggest problem with this layout is that your antenna is going to be obstructed by the user's hand. You would get better results by using an antenna which extends away from the controller's casing.</p>

<p>If you don't want to do that, I would suggest <em>swapping</em> the roles of the two wires. Assuming your antenna “GND” is tied to the circuit ground of the rest of the controller, that circuit ground is already somewhat capacitively coupled to the user's hands, so it's best to put the other pole of the antenna in the least-coupling position.</p>

<p>However, this theoretically gives you a horizontally polarized antenna instead of vertical-or-45°-depending polarization, which might be worse — how much polarization matters depends on how reflective the environment you're operating in is.</p>

<p>To summarize as direct responses to my original questions:</p>

<li>Yes, an unlicenced individual can use equipment at a club station if supervised by a qualified operator.</li>
<li>A non-qualified operator should use the call sign an authorized operator would use when operating the station. For a club station, this would generally be the club station call sign.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Regarding the first question, about whether an unlicenced individual can operate under supervision.</em></p>
  
  <p>The Industry Canada regulatory document RIC-3 contains the following comment:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>1.5 Non-Qualified Persons</strong></p>
    
    <p>Non-qualified persons may use an amateur radio station provided a qualified operator is in attendance to perform the control functions. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Regarding the second question, about identification.</em></p>
  
  <p>...I didn't find any Industry Canada guidelines. Certainly <strong>the non-qualified operator should use the call sign an authorized operator would use when operating the station.</strong>
  This is usually the club station call sign when operating the club station.</p>
  
  <p>That is what I have seen done on field days at ""Get-On-The-Air"" stations,
  at stations in museums and science centres, as well as stations operating
  with a club or RAC call sign for contests.
  The call sign was not changed when different radio amateurs took turns supervising.</p>
  
  <p>[T]he move away from licensing...to certifying radio amateurs left the status of station call signs a little more murky.
  I am not aware of any firm rules on this so you can use common sense.
  If your practice is for the ham operating the club station to sometimes use their own call this could be an option when a ham is supervising non-qualified operators.
  However, <strong>the club call sign is always correct.</strong></p>

"Tuning an antenna with cold weather","121","","<p>I have a 20m long dipole that starts at 2m above the ground and ends at perhaps 20m above the ground. It was -10 °C here tonight (that's +14 °F), currently around zero (32 °F) and my antenna is out of tune because of this (I noticed it before with slightly warmer weather). There are also small icicles everywhere on it, of perhaps 1-2mm long.</p>

<p><a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/q/6575/885"">My antenna tuner</a> already was close to its limits when tuning for 20m and now its completely out of range. The obvious solution is to use a smaller capacitor to shift the range. Is that the best option, or can I better do something else to deal with the cold weather?</p>

<p>From the transceiver to the tuner is coax, from the tuner to the antenna ladder (4m inside, 5m outside). The antenna is a 20m dipole, so two sides of 10m.</p>
","<p>You say your dipole's total length is 20 meters, and you are using it on the 20 meter band. When the dipole's length is equal to some multiple of the wavelength (1λ, 2λ, 3λ, ...) the dipole is antiresonant, and the feedpoint impedance is at a maximum. Being the worst possible match, it will require maximum range from your tuner.</p>

<p>If the total length of the dipole is half a wavelength, or some odd multiple thereof (0.5λ, 1.5λ, 2.5λ, ...) the antenna is resonant. Feedpoint impedance is at a minimum, around 73 ohms. This is a good match and you don't even need a tuner, although you may need to take the antenna up and down a few times to adjust the length initially.</p>

<p>You can explain this effect by thinking of one side of the dipole as a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarter-wave_impedance_transformer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">quarter-wave transformer</a>. The end of the dipole must be a high impedance (where can the current go?) So consequently the feedpoint, a quarter-wavelength away, will see a low impedance. With the dipole a total wavelength long, each side is half a wavelength long. You can think of this as two quarter-wavelength transformers together, in other words, no impedance transformation at all. So the feedpoint sees the high impedance at the end of the dipole.</p>

<p>I suspect if you make your dipole any other length, you'll be able to tune it. And if you operate primarily on the 20 meter band, I'd suggest making the antenna a half wavelength at that frequency. You don't gain anything by making it longer, you'll lower SWR on the feedline and associated losses, and your tuner won't need as much range.</p>

<p>But while the frequencies are close, another difference between the incoming and outgoing signals is just that: they are traveling in opposite directions! Could a repeater use a directional coupler to separate the two signals?</p>
","<p>Are you thinking something like this?</p>

<p>Let's say you have a really good directional coupler with a directivity of 55dB. And the antenna is a good match with a VSWR of 1.1, or equivalently a return loss of 26 dB. And the transmitter power is 10 W, or 30 dBm. And we'll say we select a directional coupler with a coupling factor of 10 dB (though as you'll see, the coupling factor doesn't really matter).</p>

<p>30 dBm, after the 55 dB directivity of the coupler, and the 10 dB coupling factor, means the receiver will see 30-55-10 = -35 dBm at its input from the transmitter.</p>

<p>Let's say we want to hear a 1 W (20 dBm) station that's 1 km from the repeater. At 144 MHz that's a free space path loss of 76 dB, so the power received at the antenna will be in the neighborhood of 20-76 = -56 dBm. Maybe a little more after adding antenna gain.</p>

<p>That -56 dBm is then subject to the 10 dB coupling factor, so at the receiver it becomes -66 dBm.</p>

<p>Signal power: -66 dBm<br>
Noise power (from the transmitter): -35 dBm<br>
SNR: -12 dB</p>

<p>Obviously this is not going to work. And it's actually worse than this, because any reflected power from the antenna will also show up at the receiver. The 30 dBm of transmitter power, after the 26 dB return loss, is 4 dBm. Then subject to the 10 dB coupling factor is another -6 dBm of transmitter power finding its way into the receiver.</p>

","<p>Having Ethernet and your antenna co-located is not an ideal situation. But then most amateur antenna situations involve compromises. The general idea of the following recommendations is to take as many precautions as practical to minimize the interference possibilities.</p>

<p>I recommend that your Ethernet cable to your WAP be a CAT6 <em>shielded</em> cable (STP). While obviously not needed for your Ethernet environment, the improved twists of the CAT6 cable along with the foil shield will improve the immunity of the Ethernet cable to ingress from your antenna while transmitting as well as increase the attenuation of leakage from the Ethernet cable to your antenna while receiving.</p>

<p>Your Ethernet cable should also have a few toroid cores of type 43 material spaced along its length to further improve the performance of the shield. Wrap 4 to 6 turns of the cable around each toroid. This attenuates common mode currents that may be flowing along the exterior of the Ethernet shield.</p>

<p>Your transmission line to the antenna should be a double shielded type coax (braid plus foil). This helps to minimize ingress / egress from your transmission line.</p>

<p>Use a high quality, ferrite 1:1 balun at the feedpoint of the antenna. This helps to reduce common mode currents on the cable that can cause interference to your Ethernet from your transmitter or cause interference from the Ethernet to your receiver.</p>

<p>Ensure that your coax length is not close to an odd multiple of 1/4 wavelength (electrical length) for the bands on which you wish to operate. An ideal length is an odd multiple of 1/2 electrical wavelength as this presents the highest impedance for common mode currents. Note that this electrical wavelength relates to the outside of the shield and is influenced by the type of jacket that is on the exterior of the coax cable.</p>

<p>Pay attention to the layout of the cables and antenna. To the greatest extent possible, have cables cross in a perpendicular fashion instead of running or meeting in a parallel fashion. Similarly have the antenna in a perpendicular orientation to the Ethernet cable. This helps to minimize the coupling between the two systems.</p>

"how does slotted coax Balun eliminate common current?","119","","<p>how does slotted coax Balun eliminate common current? why the length of the slot should be quarter wavelength?</p>
","<p>The slotted coax balun is very similar to the folded balun (aka Pawsey stub).  I wrote about the folded balun in my article...</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.hamradio.me/antennas/coax-velocity-factor.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Coax Velocity Factor in Baluns, Does it Matter?</a></p>

<p>The references at the bottom of the article provide some good quotes to consider.  There are two things to consider for your question: why and where the split balun is shorted back together.</p>

<h2>Why the split balun is shorted</h2>

<p>Balanis discusses the theory behind matching techniques including the 1/4 Wave Coaxial 1:1 Balun. In particular he describes the purpose of the electrical short of the coax center conductor to shield, is to maintain balance, thereby, ensuring no current flows back to the transceiver on the outside of the coax.  As both halves of the split balun are fed by energy at the feedpoint 180 degrees out of phase, when the currents join at the shorted end, they are in balance and just act like a short between each other with little eagerness to flow current to the third conductor (the mast or feed system).</p>

<p>I've built several folded baluns for various tests and do find they put a hard stop on any common mode current that tries to flow back down the feed system and over essentially all frequencies (or at least frequencies well outside the antenna's operation band).  It may well be erroneous to say all common mode current is stopped, but my measurements suggests certainly most is quelled by the, essentially, short across the end of the feed line.</p>

<h2>Where the split balun is shorted</h2>

<p>If we make the split balun portion much shorter than a quarter-wave at the desired operating frequency, we can see we are simply shorting the feedpoint of the antenna and nothing will work optimally.  However, if we place this short exactly one quarter-wavelength back along the feed system, we can surmise the transformer action of a quarter-wave length of wire will convert the impedance at one end to a different impedance at the other.  The classic example of a quarter-wave wire transformer are the radials and vertical of the classic quarter-wave monopole antenna.  The high impedance present at the end of the radials (because they are in freespace) is converted to a low impedance 1/4, 3/4, 5/4, etc. wavelengths away from the tip.  In this way, the radials present a low impedance (opposite their tip impedance) to the center of the antenna thereby drawing lots of shield current and leaving less to flow back down the antenna mast or feedline.</p>

<p>The split or slotted coaxial balun works the same way, but in reverse.  In this case the location where the split balun joins is considered a direct short to each other and the feed system.  This low impedance is converted through the 1/4 wavelength of conductor to a high impedance at the feed point.  In this use, the high impedance presents a strong rejection to the relatively low impedance currents and keeps them from flowing back down the line thus keeping the currents on the intended antenna elements.</p>

<p>Balanis summarizes this much better:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The parallel auxiliary line need not be made 1/4 wave in length to achieve the balance. It is made 1/4 wave to prevent the upsetting of the normal operation of the antenna.”</p>

Attempting to use a 75 ohm coaxial cable with a rig expecting to see 50 ohms of impedance will result in a portion of your transmitted signal being reflected back into the radio (or amplifier). This raises your SWR and will either cause your radio to decrease (fold back) its power (if it's a newer rig), or can cause your final amplifier to heat up faster than it should and can burn it out. (Don't get confused - characteristic impedance is measured in ohms, but it isn't measured with a multimeter. This has nothing to do with resistive power loss, it has to do with the ratio between voltage and current of a wave on that cable.)</p>

<p>Loss per unit distance is the big one. Generally speaking, the larger the cable, the lower the loss - but it also depends on frequency. Higher frequencies typically result in higher loss. This is usually given in decibles per hundred feet, and a value of $3dB/100ft$ means that if you use 100 ft of that coax at that frequency, you'll lose half of your power. If you need to get the loss of a particular cable, or compare two cables, you should get a chart or table from the manufacturer. <a href=""http://www.w4rp.com/ref/coax.html"" rel=""nofollow"">This table</a> lists some common types of coax at a variety of frequencies.</p>

<p>Velocity factor isn't something you'll need often. It tells you how fast a wave will propagate along that cable - which you can use if you want to build a phased array, for example. This is where you have two (or more) antennas spaced a certain distance apart, and also delay the signal going to some of the antennas so that they constructively interfere with each other in the direction of the array. It allows you to create a much tighter beam, at the cost of needing more space and supplies.</p>

"How do PL tones make it through so much noise?","118","","<p>So sometimes I hear people trying to get into a repeater with pure noise, and no audible audio on their transmission. </p>

<p>With the repeaters that require a PL tone, how can the PL tones get through all of that noise if I can barely get DTMF through with a bit of white noise?</p>
","<p>As Michael noted, a repeater's CTCSS system is looking for a very specific frequency with a very low deviation (typically 10% or less) as low as about 40 dB down.  What you are hearing is of course the whole audio range.</p>

<p>The decoder in a CTCSS system is based on a very narrow bandpass filter which passes the desired CTCSS tone. There is a balance between a tone that can be quickly recognized and one that can intrude on the audio.  The higher the frequency of the tone, the faster the hardware can recognize it and open the transmit, but the more likely you'll notice it.  On the other hand a very low tone consequently takes longer to be recognized and you risk missing a syllable or two off the beginning of a transmission.</p>

<p>These days most amateur radio repeater controller manufacturers offer an audio delay option - this delays the repeated speech audio for a selectable number of milliseconds before it is retransmitted. During this delay period, the CTCSS decoder has enough time to recognize the right tone. This also keeps two transceivers in close proximity to each other (say two people with HTs) from creating an annoying impromptu oscillator. </p>

"Is there an audio feature for Gpredict?","118","","<p>I am trying to learn about how to talk to satellites and the ARISS via ham radio. What I am wondering is if there is an audio feature I can access for the azimuth. In the sun, I cannot really see the images on the laptop that well, so this would be helpful. I use Gpredict for a satellite tracking program. Any suggestions are always helpful, thank you very much in advance. </p>
","<p><strong>I just wrote you one.</strong></p>

<p>One of the things Gpredict can do is control antenna rotators (via the <em>hamlib</em> driver library).

<li>In Gpredict, go to Edit → Preferences → Interface → Rotators → Add New. Put in some name or other and leave the rest of the settings alone.</li>

"Using more than 400W in the UK","118","","<p>With a full amateur license in the UK, up to 400W can be used - however, there are cases that might call for higher power, such as bouncing signals off the moon.</p>

<p>Is there any way I can obtain permission to use a higher power, even if this is temporarily and within a specific area? Or is it completely forbidden?</p>
","<p>This is not commonplace. Most operators in the UK get along fine with the 400W limit. Given the path losses inherent in Earth-Moon-Earth - hundreds of decibels - the antenna is a much more important factor than is the power. You need every extra bit of push you can get, but if you're not making it at 400W, 1500W isn't likely to be much better.</p>

<p>Remember that doubling the power equates to only half an S-unit at the receiver. Even going from 400W to 1600W would only give you an extra 6dB gain - and wouldn't help you receive other people's signals at all. Invest in a better antenna rather than a better amplifier, you'll see much better reception in both directions.</p>

","<p>Rod,</p>

<p>Ends of wires are connected if they are at the same location. Your model is correct in this regard.  However, the wires need to be about one-quarter wavelength long rather than the full wavelength shown.  </p>

<p>The 4NEC2 software provides the Automatic Gain Test (AGT) check box when you Generate (<kbd>F7</kbd>) the results of your model.  Use this in the early stages of modeling.  If the Gain correction is too large the results will be in red indicating the model needs to be corrected.</p>

<p>Height for a model over ground needs to be one-half wavelength for optimum conditions.  After your model is satisfactory, adjust height according to your real conditions and see what changes. Your model at one-tenth wavelength will show most of the radiation being reflected upward.  Use the free space option if you wish to eliminate ground interactions.</p>

<p>The radial angle downward will need to be 40-45 degrees to get a minimum SWR around 50 Ohms. The 30 degree setting you show will be an impedance under 50 Ohms.  Since you use Symbols, you can use the Optimizer function to find the best (L)lengths.  Similarly, you can optimize for best angle if you use Sin()*L and Cos()*L of the element Length.</p>

<p>Here is the 4NEC2 model information about elevated radials.<br>
<a href=""http://www.qsl.net/kk4obi/Elevated%20Radials.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.qsl.net/kk4obi/Elevated%20Radials.html</a></p>

<p>Your model should be able to reproduce the results of the 4-radial model included in the study. (That model coding is not directly comparable because it uses spherical geometry and adjustable center-fed/off-center feed at any angle for all elements).</p>

<p>The Load card (LD) is an unnecessary complication at this stage of development.</p>

The datasheet doesn't mention VHF design specifications. Has anyone used the PA for VHF design? If yes then please share your designs.</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>The datasheet doesn't mention VHF design specifications.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>VHF is 30-300 MHz. The Chip is only specified for 100 MHz upwards – so the lower part of VHF will definitely work very suboptimally.</p>

<p>So my first reaction would be: you're trying to use the wrong amplifier for VHF.</p>

<p>Anyway, assuming you're just considering the 100 – 300 MHz range: As far as I can read the data sheet, I'd say they expect a designer to have access to a network analyzer; the numbers they give for nominal complex input impedance for 430 MHz indicate that if you can design a 100 MHz - 300 MHz line with 50 Ohm impedance, then you should be fine :)</p>

<p>So, the main problem here is that you're in charge of designing a matching circuit, and that for a very wide band (100 - 300 MHz is as much bandwidth than the center frequency of 200 MHz! This means you need a wideband matching circuit). That won't be trivial. To be honest, you should ask their sales people for S-parameters at 100 – 300 MHz if this is your region of interest.</p>

<p>Generally, if you don't have access to calibrated microwave network analyzers, I'd simply estimate a matching inductance value from their 900 and 430 MHz examples, and try with their eval board; not like that you could get perfect matching with a single component over the whole 100-300 MHz band, anyways.</p>

<li>bands with higher <em>wavelength</em> e.g. 40m/80m/160m?</li>
</ul>

<p>It seems like an ambiguous way to refer to the ""height"" of a <em>band</em> rather than either its frequency or wavelength directly, so whenever I see this usage I am uncertain.</p>
","<p>In <em>this</em> case, they probably mean higher frequency. Two pieces of evidence:</p>

<ul>
<li>One typically says “<strong>longer/shorter</strong> wavelength”, not “higher/lower wavelength”.</li>
<li>Lower power output at higher frequencies is common, because components' and circuits' characteristics are generally worse at higher frequencies.</li>
</ul>

<p>But there are also opposite terms, like “top band” for 160 meters.</p>

<p>I would personally avoid saying things like “higher bands” exactly because of this ambiguity; perhaps instead “higher-frequency bands”.</p>

"2m Biquad - Why not?","116","","<p>I'm thinking about putting together an Echolink link node on my local repeater frequency so I can participate in the weekly net when out of town. This seems straightforward as it's simply:</p>

<p>Being in an HOA, I have to try and keep my house from looking like an antenna farm / porcupine, so I thought ""why not a panel antenna?"" I figure I can build the elements out of 10AWG solid wire and place it on a vertical surface outside my house, paint it with leftover house paint, and it should be nicely unobtrusive.</p>

<p>Is there a reason not to build a biquad for such a purpose? Is there a better (less observable, easier to build, ...?) antenna for connecting from one known point to another?</p>

<p>I considered a simple dipole, but there's no good way to mount it and I have rain gutters on the side of the house that faces the repeater. A biquad, being relatively flat <em>and</em> vaguely directional, seems like an ideal solution to this particular task.</p>
","<p>Why not indeed. A biquad sounds like a fine solution, with the only caveat that on 2 meters (145 MHz) it will be significantly larger than the 2.4 GHz constructions typically seen. The size of the panel is on the order of one wavelength, so you're looking at something approximately 2 meters square. At that size you may want to construct the panel from a cage of wires, as a 4 square meter sheet of copper will be a little expensive.</p>

<p>The other difficulty is mounting the antenna high. Due to line-of-sight propagation on VHF, once the antenna is beyond the radio horizon, path losses increase sharply. This is because you must now rely on scattering off other objects to get your signal across.</p>

<p>So, given the option of mounting a panel antenna down low on the side of the house, and mounting a smaller antenna up high, I'd opt for the latter.</p>

<p>For example, HTs often come with compact antennas which are smaller than the 1/4 wavelength that would be required of a resonant monopole. Such an antenna, say mounted on your gutters for a ground plane, and painted to match your roof, may be sufficiently small that it will go unnoticed.</p>

"Sound quality in portable FM radio devices vs dedicated stations","116","","<p>When speaking to a portable radio transmitter the sounds usually gets distorted. However in radio stations that are dedicated to play music the sound is significantly better.
First of all, why? And second how can I make it better?
The system I use can transmit from 30Mhz to 87.975Mhz with 30Khz bandwidth (military system) and I want to play music over it (I connected the audio input to my phone).
I know it's a radio problem because when I use wire the sound is better.</p>
","<p>Bandwidth:  Broadcast FM stations are spaced 200 KHz apart, with the intention of allowing this kind of signal structure without interference:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Djn44.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Djn44.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The FM broadcast bandwidth of just more than 50 KHz is quite sufficient for near-CD quality stereo.</p>

<p>Normal broadcast FM uses multiplexing so the main channel includes L+R - both channels - what we call Mono. Then there is a subcarrier that sends L-R. The receiver detects the pilot signal (subcarrier) and lights up the ""stereo"" light, so the receiver knows to use a demultiplexer to separate the L and R signals which it then sends to your amplifier and speakers.</p>

<hr>

<p>Sound quality:  FM broadcast stations always use audio processors that are specifically tuned to make it sound better than any handheld radio's microphone circuitry will be able to duplicate.  </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fzdsQ.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fzdsQ.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>(This one is roughly $10,000)</p>

<p>They also incorporate pre-emphasis so the roll-off of higher frequencies in the receiver IF bandpass filters are not as audible.</p>

<p>Dolby sound operates on a similar principle - to counteract artifacts introduced by the entire receiving chain including the speakers.</p>

<p>It takes a lot of work to properly tune the audio processor at a broadcast station.  </p>

<hr>

<p>Thus there is no comparison to a ham signal with 5 KHz deviation and no audio processing, with a small microphone.  It can be easily heard.</p>

<hr>

<p>The military system you describe operates with 30 KHz deviation.  The receivers probably also have a 30 KHz bandpass filter, which means theoretically it should be able to reproduce up to 15 KHz audio frequencies.  </p>

<p>But no filter is has perfect ""cliff"" edges, so there will be some kind of gradual roll-off at the higher audio frequencies.</p>

<p>One thing you can do with it for music, short of adding an audio processor, is to provide some sort of pre-emphasis.  </p>

<p>This can be done with a regular equalizer on the input.  </p>

<hr>

<p>In broadcasting, to really tune it up well you would want to put a pink noise source (maybe an app) into the transmitter, then watch on a receiver with an audio spectrum analyzer.  Adjust the transmitter's audio-input equalizer until you get a flat response end-to-end.  </p>

<p>The <code>TRACEn-N</code> path, as opposed to that, is intended to let digipeaters insert their callsign when forwarding. However, despite the use of <code>WIDEn-N</code>, I see one or multiple digipeaters in the path of most packets.</p>

<p><strong>Are there still valid use cases for <code>TRACEn-N</code>? Will a <code>TRACEn-N</code> packet have the same coverage as a <code>WIDEn-N</code> one?</strong></p>
","<p>Actually, current specifications <a href=""http://aprs.org/fix14439.html"" rel=""nofollow"">encourage or require digipeaters to add their callsigns to the WIDEn-N path</a>, since including callsigns greatly helps in finding and fixing all sorts of network issues (look for ""traceable"" in the page). <code>WIDE1-1</code> is often replaced by the callsign of a dumb digipeater, <code>WIDE2-1</code> is usually prepended by the callsign of a digipeater.</p>

<p><strong><code>TRACEn-N</code> is often useful for diagnostics.</strong> Many areas still have obsolete digipeaters in use, which don't add their own callsigns to the <code>WIDEn-N</code> path, and those digipeaters often do add their callsign to <code>TRACEn-N</code> paths. So someone might want to sometimes temporarily use <code>TRACEn-N</code> to see which digipeaters are retransmitting your packets. If all digipeaters in your area have already been upgraded to make <code>WIDEn-N</code> traceable, it should not make much difference at all.</p>

<p>Unless there is a digipeater which completely ignores <code>TRACEn-N</code> packets in your area (would be surprising), it should get the <strong>same coverage</strong>.</p>

<p>Prepending a few digipeater callsigns in the packet path does not have a significant practical effect on transmission time/size, since each callsign-SSID pair is only 7 bytes long (56 bits - 6 bytes for callsign, plus one byte for SSID as an integer), which at 1200 bits/s takes 46.7 ms to send. Kenwood TH-D72 has a default <strong>txdelay</strong> setting of 300 milliseconds, which at 1200 bits per second already attributes to 360 bits of ""waste"" in the beginning of each transmission. Other radios and trackers have similar and sometimes longer default settings for txdelay - even up to 500 ms. And then there's the actual packet contents, which often are very long with uncompressed coordinates and verbose comment texts.</p>

"Efficient BPSK31 amplification","115","","<p>I'm looking at making a portable system that can transmit BPSK31. I have a limited power budget, so I'm looking at trying to make my final power amplifier as efficient as possible. From my understanding, you can't use a plain non-linear amplifier (e.g. Class C or E) because BPSK31 isn't a constant envelope signal. The amplitude drops to zero on bit changes, and that behavior prevents splatter on bit changes. </p>

<p>Is there a way to efficiently amplify BPSK31, or am I stuck with an inefficient final amplifier?</p>
","<p>There is a way, but you don't end up with an amplifier that you can connect to an ordinary rig. The trick is to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_modulation"" rel=""nofollow"">express the signal as phase and amplitude</a>.</p>

<p>Consider: with an ordinary non-linear amplifier (such as typical for FM use, for example) you can manipulate phase (and thus, also frequency), but the amplitude is fixed by the amplifier's supply voltage.</p>

<p>What if you vary the supply voltage? You then have a way to also manipulate amplitude. If you can manipulate phase and amplitude, then you can express anything that can be expressed in I/Q representation -- the only difference is that you are doing it in polar coordinates instead of Cartesian coordinates.</p>

<p>Now you have the problem of making an efficient ""amplifier"", the output of which is the power supply for the class C amplifier. However, since the amplitude variations are much slower in this polar domain (for PSK31, only 31.25 Hz), this is a substantially easier problem. A switch-mode power supply can do the task.</p>

<p>This seems pretty simple, so you might wonder why everyone doesn't use amplifiers like this. The trouble lies in <a href=""http://www.circuitdesign.info/blog/2008/08/challenges-of-polar-modulation/"" rel=""nofollow"">implementation details</a>. However, if you are designing for the specific case of PSK31, then you can take specific knowledge of the modulation into account for your design. Also, PSK31 is such a simple and slow scheme, the challenges are much less than they would be if we were trying to make an amplifier for a cellular phone or Wi-Fi radio.</p>

"RG-174 to pull signal from 1st IF?","115","","<p>I've built a high impedance buffer out of an op amp on a small piece of perf board. I'm going to attach the input to the first IF on an Icom IC-718 and the output will be pulled out to a jack that I've drilled into the case.</p>

<p>I know that I want to keep stuff as short as possible... but at the same time, there's no super good place to mount the board that I've created. How bad an idea is it to tap into the IF with a piece of RG-174 that's about 6 inches long between the IF and the board? I would tie the shield to ground as close to where I tap the IF as possible.</p>

<p>This is my first major modification to an expensive radio beyond repairs and I'm trying really hard to get it right the first time. :)</p>
","<p>So, you say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don't care if the signals are delayed. I'm just tapping the line out to a pan adapter. I am most concerned about influencing the existing function of the receiver</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that's <em>exactly</em> what you're going to do with this.</p>

<p>Your Opamp circuit has a high impedance, which translates into ""looks like an open end"". That means that your tapping coax has a very distinct feature: A <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_coefficient""><em>reflection coefficient</em></a> of 1.</p>

<p>This can easily be seen by the ""mismatch"" equation: The ratio of electric field (voltage!) going through the interface between two transmission lines with different impedances and getting reflect is defined as:</p>

<p>$\Gamma = \frac{E^-}{E^+} = \frac{Z_2 - Z_1}{Z_1 + Z_2} $</p>

<p>with $Z_1$ being the impedance of the transmission line from which the wave comes, and $Z_2$ being the impedance of the second transmission line or the sinking device.</p>

<p>In your case, $Z_2\rightarrow \infty$, and hence</p>

<p>$$\begin{align}
\lim_{Z_2\rightarrow \infty} \Gamma &amp;=\lim_{Z_2\rightarrow \infty}  \frac{Z_2 - Z_1}{Z_1 + Z_2}\\
&amp;= \lim_{Z_2\rightarrow \infty}  \frac{\frac{Z_2}{Z_2} - \frac{Z_1}{Z_2}}{\frac{Z_1}{Z_2} + \frac{Z_2}{Z_2}}\\
&amp;= \lim_{Z_2\rightarrow \infty}  \frac{1 - \frac{Z_1}{Z_2}}{\frac{Z_1}{Z_2} + 1}\\
&amp;=\frac{1-0}{0+1}\\
&amp;=1
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>That means that <em>all</em> energy put into that tap line returns to the line you've tapped – which is pretty logical! Where should the energy you ""steal"" from the original coax go if you don't sink it somewhere? It's pretty clear you'll have a bad SWR in this situation.</p>

<p>So let's look at the wave from your IF line:</p>

<p>It meets the point where you've tapped the original line. Let's assume that you've build a reflection-free splitter here – that's highly unlikely, but it makes things both better for your use case, and easier to understand.</p>

<p>So, the wave enters your 6 inch (really, inches are a terrible unit for RF design – with meters, and hertz, everything can be calculated without converting) line. That's about $d=0.15\text{ m}$.</p>

<p>Now, RG-174 has a <em>velocity factor</em> of 0.66 – meaning that a wave travels with $\frac 23$ of the speed of light in vacuum, which is accurately enough $v_{RG-174}=\frac 23 \, 3\cdot 10^8\frac{\text m}{\text s} = 2\cdot 10^8\frac{\text m}{\text s}$.</p>

<p>So, for the distance between your tapping point, and the end of your RG174, and back, the wave needs </p>

<p>$\Delta t = \frac{2d}{v_{RG-174}} = \frac{0.3\text{ m}}{2\cdot 10^8\frac{\text m}{\text s}}$.</p>

<p>After that time, the wave will hit the tapping point – and <strong>interfere</strong> with the original IF!</p>

<p>By adding up a wave and a delayed version, you have built a frequency-selective device – a <em>filter</em>.</p>

<p>Now, what's relevant here is to know the <em>phase</em> with which the interference will happen. Let's have a look at that. </p>

<p>The phase $\varphi$ of a signal is the delay, measured in full periods $T$ of the signal (and period is related to frequency by $T=\frac1f$; from your comment, $f=70\text{ MHz}$); in other words: </p>

<p>$$\begin{align}
\Delta \varphi &amp;= 2\pi \frac{\Delta t}{T}\\
&amp;= 2\pi \frac{\Delta t}{\frac1f}\\
&amp;= 2\pi \frac{\frac{2d}{v_{RG-174}}}{\frac1f}\\
&amp;= 2\pi \frac{2df}{v_{RG-174}}
&amp;\approx 2\pi \cdot 0.1
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>In other words, you're overlaying your original IF signal with a 0.1 waveperiods delayed version of itself. That <strong>will</strong> cancel out specific frequencies, while others will be amplified.</p>

<p>Now, we could derive the frequency response of the <strong>tapped delay line</strong> filter you've built – but since that will in practice depend a lot on things that are hard to know beforehand, like reflection coefficient of your tap (since that massively changes impedance of the line, depending on a lot of things), exact length, etc, this would be pretty much in vain.</p>

<p>The essence is: don't tap analog coax lines. Simple as that. </p>

<p>Get a proper splitter with the correct input impedance, and make sure your opamp circuit is impedance-matched to your transmission line. Everything else will end in significant reflections, interference and frequency-dependent cancelation of signal that is hard to predict and to measure.</p>

"Why is 2 meter pre-programed?","115","","<p>When I tried to enter frequencies in my 2 meter YAESU, it was already programmed for 144.000 MHz as the primary. WHY?</p>
","<p>You'll have to be more specific about what “the primary” is (give your radio model and the exact words/labels it uses in your question) for a more definite answer, but most likely it's simply that 144.000 MHz is the lowest frequency that is part of the 2-meter band (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-meter_band"" rel=""nofollow"">this is true worldwide</a>), so it's a reasonable place to start for a VFO which has got to have <em>some</em> frequency to be on.</p>

","<blockquote>
  <p>Does mixed-mode operation qualify as a QSO?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'd say <em>absolutely, yes.</em> You're making contact with another amateur radio station on a frequency allocated to amateur radio; in my book, that qualifies as an amateur radio contact or QSO.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is the legal status of such a cross-mode QSO?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Assuming that <em>your</em> license allows you to transmit on the frequency and mode that <em>you</em> are transmitting on, I see no reason why there would be any legal problems with such a QSO. The law can only apply to what you transmit, not to what you receive.</p>

<p>It <em>might</em> be possible that in some jurisdictions there are restrictions imposed on what kind of receivers individuals may possess, but even so, I think we have to assume that your possession of the receiver is legal; if it is not, then that's a completely separate problem.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How would it be entered in the log?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would enter the details of my transmission, with a suitable comment in the comments field for the received signal. For example, station A would write mode CW, comment ""received SSB"" or something like that; station B would write mode SSB, comment ""received CW"".</p>

<p>One large part of the rationale for this is that if anyone ever complains about your station operating (for example, due to interference), what will matter is <em>your</em> transmissions, not what you received.</p>

<p>Again, certain jurisdictions may have specific requirements. If that is the case in your situation, you should refer to your local regulations for guidance on what exactly to write into the station log. That said, I would expect any such regulations to be centered around the own station's activities.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is this situation covered by a regulation?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I doubt it is, although you'd have to consult your locale-specific regulations to be certain.</p>

<p>It <em>may</em> complicate things slightly if you want to use that contact to apply for a mode-specific award, but that's about the only complication I can think of. If you want to claim such a QSO for credit toward a mode-specific award, you'd have to contact the issuer of that award and ask how exactly they will count it.</p>

<p>And of course, the QSL card cannot say for example <em>mode 2xCW</em> or <em>mode two-way CW</em> because that would be inaccurate. For a cross-mode contact, I'd probably make it explicit which mode was used by which station, for example by writing <em>mode CW(CL1SGN), SSB(CL2SGN)</em>.</p>

","<p>""RG"" stems from old, obsolete military specifications, standing for ""radio guide"", and the number is actually arbitrary.  Part of the reason they are obsolete is that they weren't specific enough - RG-6 can reasonably be assumed to have an 18 gauge solid center conductor, but beyond that the dielectric, velocity factor, or completeness of the shielding conductor aren't always specified.  Some amount of standardization exists, as shown in the wikipedia article, with additional characters after the ""RG-6"" type code.</p>

<p>Whenever you see generalizations like ""RG-6 has better performance than RG-59 for application X"" you must ask for manufacturer and part number for the two cables, because the performance advantage might not exist with two other ""RG-6"" and ""RG-59"" cables.</p>

"Does a rotating source antenna (omi) cause any issue for receiving?","112","","<p>Lets say I want to send some data from the London eye. I decide to mount the antenna at the centre of the wheel point out (normal to the circular plane). It's an omnidirectional antenna so I know there wont be any issue of point specifically, but due to the rotation of the wheel (and hence the antenna) does it cause any serious issue for a receiver on the ground (let say at the base of the wheel)? What if the receiver is moving (in a car driving past the base of the wheel)?</p>

<p>Now, my current understand of how this works is since it doesn't matter where you are located relative to the antenna, it shouldn't matter if the antenna is rotating. However my intuition is that this isn't right! That there would be some issue with the received signal (similar to Doppler maybe?).</p>
","<p>“Omnidirectional antenna” is a bit of a misnomer; there is no antenna which radiates equally in all directions on the sphere. I'm going to assume you mean some kind of monopole or coaxial antenna, i.e. one that has all of its parts in a straight line.</p>

<p>In that case, if it is, as you say, <strong>on</strong> the axis of rotation, then the rotation makes no difference whatsoever. After all, it's rotationally symmetric about that axis. The radiation pattern is also symmetric (in both amplitude and phase) about that axis.</p>

<p>If you were to mount the antenna in the same orientation, but not at the center of the wheel, then there would be a very small amount of Doppler shift, since the distance from it to the receiving antenna changes. But the velocity is so small that it would not significantly affect reception — after all, it's slower than a radio in a car on a highway.</p>

<p>(For an example of a radio technology which <em>does</em> make use of significant Doppler shifts due to (effectively) moving antennas, take a look at <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHF_omnidirectional_range"" rel=""nofollow"">VOR (VHF Omnidirectional Range)</a>).</p>

<hr>

<p>On the other hand, if you were to mount the antenna in the plane of the wheel instead, there would be major effects.</p>

<p>If your receiver is in a direction near the plane of the wheel, then the signal will drop out twice per revolution, as the two nulls of the antenna align with the receiver.</p>

<p>If your receiver is in a direction near the axis of the wheel (e.g. some distance away and looking at it), then it sees the <em>polarization</em> of the signal rotate. Using a normal, linearly polarized, antenna, the receiver would observe it fade out twice per revolution (as the polarization difference reaches ±90°). If the receiver instead had a circularly polarized antenna, then the signal would be stable but have a consistent 3 dB loss.</p>

<p>(This last scenario is exactly how communication with amateur satellites, which are usually spinning relative to the earth and have linearly polarized antennas, is best accomplished.)</p>

"Mathematica notebook for NEC2 (NEC, Numerical Electromagnics Code)","112","","<p>Are there any open source Mathematica notebooks that interface with NEC2? I am primarily interested in plotting the NEC2 results from Mathematica.</p>
","<p>I use Mathematica with NEC4 which would work essentially the same as with NEC2.  I find Mathematica to be a great front end to NEC4 for not only graphing results but also preparing functions for various mathematical operations (i.e. doing Calculus with the resulting solutions).</p>

<p>Originally, I created a notebook of various functions that I wrote to perform the operations I used in plotting results or doing other operations on the solution data.  This was integrated with NEC4 to the point that I even prepared the input geometry description of the antenna using Mathematica.  Also, I would execute NEC4 from Mathematica passing the names of input data files and the names of my desired output file for subsequent loading into Mathematica structures.</p>

<p>I no longer do that because it was just too much of a hassle to maintain and it provided no real benefits.  Now, I prepare the antenna geometry data using an editor and also several Python programs I wrote to create geometry for configurations that consisted of many ""wires"" in specific geometry patterns.  For example, radials for an antenna or patch work such as when I modeled my pickup truck as a ground plane.</p>

<p>I execute NEC4 as an ordinary batch like program producing the output solution file.  I also have Python programs that read and scrape the desired data from the formatted print created by NEC4 and then I create individual data files for later import into Mathematica.</p>

<p>I have a variety of execution types where I know the type of data being produced which my Python scraping programs handle.  For example, scraping the antenna feed point input data which provides the data I use to compute the SWR at the feed point.  I also scrape the gain data for producing 3D plots of the radiation field.</p>

<p>I have a whole list of ideas of things to do, other graphs to produce and doing a better job of modeling transmission lines of various types using the manufacturers data (R, L, and C models).</p>

<p>For my 80-meter dipole that is fed with 450-ohm ladder line I do a full frequency sweep from 3.0 MHz to 54 MHz for every 10 KHz.  This is a whole lot of data.  For the gain data to do the radiation patterns my resulting data file is 240 MB in size and that is filtering the data to every 100 KHz.  However, using this data I do a full 3D interpolation of the gain data to create smoothed functions I use for example for Integration or taking Derivatives.  Using some of the Mathematica built in functions, I can use the resulting SWR data from the frequency sweep to find all the resonant spots of the antenna where I define resonance as the bandwidth of an SWR that is under 2:1.</p>

<p>So, in summary, my work consists of the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Mathematic function source of my own functions.</li>
<li>Python programs used to aid in creation of antenna geometry input.</li>
<li>Python programs used to scrape the formatted output of NEC4.</li>
</ol>

<p>Right now, I think I have around 40 of my own Mathematica functions that perform various operations or plot graphs.  And, maybe a half-dozen Python programs that generate ""repeated"" structures for antenna geometry data.  And, about 4 formatted output scraper Python programs that pull the interesting data from the so-called ""pretty-print"" produced by NEC4.</p>

<p>Oh, I have also modified the NEC4 program to generate other data of interest as well and also to track performance since some of my executions take as long as an hour (large frequency sweeps).  Although NEC2 is coded in Fortran ala Fortran 77 or something close to that, NEC4 is coded in Fortran 90 plus some features from Fortran 95.  NEC4 is licensed from Lawrence Livermore Laboratories.  At the time I got my license about 6 years ago it was $300.</p>

<p><strong>A Simple Example -- 20 meter vertical with perfect ground</strong></p>

<p>The antenna itself is a ground mounted vertical that is made from 1/2 copper tubing (I actually have this antenna though not set up right now, I made it myself from Home Depot materials).  For this model I chose a perfect ground (an option in NEC4/NEC2) but a more realistic ground without radials and then a model with radials can be done as well.  I use this antenna with 4 radials so I don't get as good of an SWR as this example shows but it is a working and effective antenna.</p>

<p>I first set up my Mathematica notebook environment as shown below:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZdzeG.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZdzeG.png"" alt=""Notebook Setup""></a></p>

<p>The statements above establish my working directory for NEC4 work and then I import my Mathematica function library supporting the NEC4 work.  By the way, this is all done with an Apple iMac-24 running OS X El Capitan.</p>

<p>Next, I read in the antenna input solution data.  This is the data that specifies the feed point voltage (R/X), feed point current (R/X), and feed point Impedance (R/X), feed point Admittance (R/X), and Power in Watts (R) for each frequency of the specified frequency sweep (given by the data file governing the solution).  The integer values 1,1,1,0 in each column are the wire tag number, segment number, and the voltage (R/X) which is reported as integers 1 and 0 for the complex value 1.0+j0.0</p>

<p>Here are the Mathematica statements that read in the antenna input:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/J0EzF.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/J0EzF.png"" alt=""antenna input""></a></p>

<p>As you can see, I use a function that I wrote called readAntennaInput[] which is given the file name of the file with this data that was scraped by one of my Python programs from the NEC4 output data.</p>

<p>The array returned, given the Mathematica label of antinput is 12 rows by 71 columns.  Each column is a different frequency for the frequency sweep.</p>

<p>Here is a portion of that data:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gfTG3.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gfTG3.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>You can see the individual frequency columns as row one designates the frequency beginning with 14.0 MHz and incrementing by 0.005 MHz until the maximum frequency of the sweep 14.35 MHz (the entire 20 meter band).  The floating point numbers you see in each column are the R and X values of the parameters mentioned above.  The two rows that have whole numbers are the R and X of the antenna feed point impedance.</p>

<p>Next I prepare the SWR function.  This is an interpolated function that computes the SWR based on a nominal value of 50.0 ohms Real.  Thus, SWR of 1:1 would suggest 50 ohms input impedance for the antenna.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0lfzr.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0lfzr.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The function that I wrote to compute this SWR Function is called prepareSWRFunction as you see above.  With this function I can do Calculus such as find minimums, do integration, do differentiation and so on.  Most importantly it creates nice smooth plots:</p>

<p>The plot function that I wrote uses the Calculus to find the minimum which is essentially taking the derivative and setting it to zero which all Calculus students have learned to do.  The result is reported as the first line that is labeled Minimum SWR Position Vector.  The next two lines of output basically extract the individual data of SWR and Frequency of minimum SWR.</p>

<p>Next is the plot itself.  The vertical Axes is SWR and the horizontal Axes is frequency.  The green line is actually the SWR curve and it is nice and flat over the entire 20 meter spectrum (the perfect ground model helps that result).</p>

<p>The blue horizontal line is the marker for an SWR of 2:1 which I consider my maximum for desired SWR.  The yellowish line is the minimum SWR which is 1.38:1.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, on this particular run I did not include the gain data so a 3-dimensional radiation field plot is not available.  If anyone is interested I can add that but probably will not get to it until next week.</p>

"Pseudorange in VHF band navigation and precision phase tracking","109","","<p>I am thinking on what is the practical limit of precision for VHF positioning system (like currently obsolete and gone ""Transit"" system). </p>

<p>It is well known how GPS receivers calculates pseudorange to each satellite to calculate the position of the receiver - GPS transmits PRN signal at 1 MBit, so by just counting the ""chips"" you can get pseudorange precision down to 1us which is 300m, and by tracking the phase you can get much more precise (ultimately to the point where you are limited by oscillator phase noise and ionospheric delays). </p>

<p>But in VHF we typically don't have bandwidth to transmit 1Mbit PRN signal even if it's below noise level, and one will have to use much lower speed, like 19200. Obviously length of 1 bit at 19200 is extremely long. </p>

<p>The question is what is the practical limit on precision of phase tracking of the signal given that it's VHF and bitrate is mere 19200? </p>

<p>Is it possible to track the phase with ultimate precision by recoding the data with SDR and after decoding the data we go back in history, and try every possible signal start time by maximum SNR using this now known data? It seems that in this case phase resolution will be limited by SDR sample rate and phase precision will be limited by length of the data packet and physical limitations (phase noise, ionosphere, e.t.c).</p>
","<p>Interesting question, and I'm surprised you haven't had any responses before now.</p>

<p>There's no fundamental limitation to the time resolution you can achieve, even in a bandlimited channel. Consider a carrier modulated by a continuous 1-kHz sinewave. A DFT can make a very accurate measurement of the phase and amplitude of this modulation. The resolution is limited by the number of samples used in the DFT, and the accuracy is limited by the amplitude and phase noise introduced by the channel.</p>

<p>Assuming the channel noise has zero mean, then longer DFTs (more samples, longer integration times) give you better results.</p>

<p>It isn't difficult to set up a simulation of this kind of system in any sort of math-processing system (e.g., Matlab, octave, numpy, etc.). Generate the signal, add the channel distortions to it, and then do the DFTs on the resulting samples and see what kind of distribution you get in the measurement errors. I would be surprised if you couldn't get down to 1 &micro;s accuracy with ""reasonable"" noise levels and integration times.</p>

<p>In order to turn this into a complete time-of-flight measurement system, you could add additional tones that carry data that would allow you to resolve the cycle-counting ambiguities.</p>

<p>Back in the late 1990s, I was doing some experiments trying to determine just how much accuracy I could extract from the time signal transmitted by the Canadian time station CHU. The problem there is that they only transmit 10 cycles of a 1-kHz tone every second (to create an audible ""tick""), and the fading/multipath on the HF bands make it impossible to maintain any sort of phase coherency from one burst to the next. It was interesting to watch this on an oscilloscope.</p>

","<p>The “pinout” for this purpose could be anything.</p>

<p>Considering the perspective of the equipment designer: If you have a multi-conductor cable of any sort and you want to use it as an antenna element, it doesn't matter at all which conductor you use.</p>

<p>(You might think that if the headphone cable is shielded then the shield would prevent it from functioning as an antenna, but that is only true if the shield is also connected through to the radio receiver. Any <em>single</em> wire is as good as any other.)</p>

<p>Here's a procedure to find out what the actual implementation is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Get a headphone splitter (Y cable), and plug in headphones to one side. Coil up the cord so it doesn't work very well as an antenna.</li>
<li>On the other side, plug in an unwired 3.5 mm plug with the shell off, or whatever else you have handy as a breakout.</li>
<li>Touch a piece of wire or a clip lead to each of the three contacts, and see which one makes the most difference to radio reception. (Since re-radiation and crosstalk are possible, the results can be fuzzy.)</li>

<p>Are there any references or considerations on house construction specific to amateur radio operation? I will need to put small ducts through the walls to route the cables. Is there any value in putting a permanent mast with a pulley at the top?</p>
","<p>Ideally you want a place to put that antenna in the clear, though getting any HF antenna in the clear on such a tiny lot is going to be tricky no matter how you do it. Not much you can do about it, besides buy a bigger lot. If the antenna is close-ish to your roof, don't worry: it will still work.</p>

<p>Masts are always useful. Whether it's permanent or not is really up to you. A pulley at the top makes pulling dipoles up easier, but also think about how you'll service rope and the pulley. You might want to make that a push-up mast, or have some way to tilt it down so you can get at the top of the mast without a tall ladder precariously balanced on your roof.</p>

<p>I also lived on a small lot once, and I installed a trap vertical on the center of the roof, with radials extending to the edge of the roof.

<p>""<em>Coupled loops are typically 1/5 to 1/3 of main loop in size</em>"" I'm talking about a second loop, about 1/3 the size of the main loop. Not central, but arranged like the circles on a Smith chart. Would the increased coupling help performance?</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I'm aware just about any wire can act as a receive antenna. I could probably build this and receive quite happily on it. My concern is more for performance when I eventually trey to transmit.</p>
","<p>Adding a smaller coupled loop will have a marginal result. The smaller, coupled loop seen on some small loop designs is there to provide impedance matching. If you wish to improve the gain of your loop antenna, consider adding a second turn to the main loop.</p>

<p>Adding an additional turn to a small loop antenna will improve its gain. But the increase in gain to due to increased radiation efficiency, not increased directivity. Recall that gain is directivity times radiation efficiency. </p>

<p>The radiation resistance of a small loop antenna is normally very low and is the largest factor in its inefficiency. The radiation resistance of a small loop goes up by the number of turns squared. So by going from one turn to two turns, you have multiplied the radiation resistance by four. That is very helpful in improving its efficiency.</p>

<p>But there is a downside as well. Each turn has a loss based on its RF resistance. But this loss goes up linearly with the number of turns. So doubling the number of turns doubles the resistive, dissipative loss.</p>

<p>Since in a typical small loop antenna the  loss resistance is much greater than the radiation resistance then the radiation efficiency (power radiated vs power applied) improvement approaches the number of turns. So a second, properly spaced turn has the potential to double the radiation efficiency and thus the gain of a small loop. As the number of turns are increased, the succesive gain in radiation efficiency starts to decline so this approximation should not be extended for additional turns.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, however, that the maximum directivity of a small loop is ~1.5. So if the loop has an ideal radiation efficiency of 1 (zero losses), the maximum possible gain is 1.76 dBi regardless of the number of turns.</p>

"SSB Modulation and Differential Signaling","108","","<p>I'm trying to learn about how SSB modulation works.  My current understanding from reading and looking at spectrum plots from SDR software is that the sound is modulated with the carrier, but only half the carrier wave.  (Alternatively, the sound's 0-point is offset either plus or minus a bit, and then modulated against the half-wave carrier.)  Then, filters are used to remove the actual carrier, resulting in a much more efficient transmission at the expense of some bandwidth.  Is this remotely accurate?</p>

<p>In any case, it seems clear that we're only using half of bandwidth.  Does that mean we can use the other half, if we wanted to?</p>

<p>What I'm wondering is if it's possible to modulate a signal using both side bands but in a differential mode.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yJjF7.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yJjF7.png"" alt=""Differential Signaling""></a></p>

<p><em>(Image from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_signaling"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_signaling</a>.)</em></p>

<p>In professional audio applications, audio signal is sent down balanced cables twice, with one side inverted.  When one side is then inverted on the receiving end and added to the other side, any noise that affected both sides in the same way is cancelled out.</p>

<p>If both side bands could be used simultaneously by the same transmitter, perhaps the lower side band could have the regular audio signal modulated on it, with the upper side band having the inverted audio signal modulated on it.  Then the receiver could flip one side and add them together, eliminating a lot of noise.</p>

<p>Does this sort of modulation exist?  Is it feasible?  If not, what parts of SSB am I not understanding?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>My current understanding from reading and looking at spectrum plots from SDR software is that the sound is modulated with the carrier, but only half the carrier wave.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's — not really accurate. A SSB signal <em>uses half the bandwidth</em> of a double-sideband (whether AM or DSB-SC) signal, but there's no sense in which it uses ""half the carrier"" in the modulation process.</p>

<p>Since you're starting from a SDR perspective, let's talk DSP and complex (IQ) signals. Any <em>real</em> signal, such as that obtained from your microphone, has, from the complex-signal perspective, a spectrum which is <em>symmetric about zero Hz</em>. <strong>All</strong> methods of generating a SSB signal are essentially methods of <em>removing</em> one half of that symmetric signal. Some of them are more like “filter it out” (complex bandpass filter) and some of them are more like “synthesize a signal which cancels out only the unwanted half” (phasing), but they all are taking what is “really” a symmetric signal and making an asymmetric signal out of it.</p>

<p>(Side note: In DSP, there is no reason to think about “carrier waves” as an essential ingredient. Because we can work at <em>complex baseband,</em> we can work with (de)modulation completely separately from frequency-shifting, whereas electronic circuits largely have to use nonzero “intermediate frequencies”. On the other hand, the “carrier frequency” is meaningful — it's a convenient reference, it's what we shift down from or up to vs. a baseband signal.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In any case, it seems clear that we're only using half of bandwidth. Does that mean we can use the other half, if we wanted to?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, but:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you use the other half for an additional independent signal, then you're just transmitting USB and LSB with the same carrier frequency.</p></li>
<li><p>If you use the other half for the same signal, then you're transmitting DSB-SC (double sideband, suppressed carrier) which is exactly the same as AM without a transmitted carrier wave. DSB-SC has most of the same properties as SSB, but of course does use the double bandwidth.</p></li>
<li><p>If you use the other half for an inverted (180° phase shifted) signal:</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>What I'm wondering is if it's possible to modulate a signal using both side bands but in a differential mode.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not usefully. As you mentioned, differential signaling is a technique to use against “noise that affected both sides in the same way”, but in the case where it's useful, you have two signals at the same frequency traveling on <em>different wires</em>. Here, you have only one “wire” (empty space), and the two signals you propose are at <em>different frequencies</em>. And that's the problem: in most cases, the RF noise affecting the upper sideband will not be the same as the noise in the lower sideband.</p>

<p>(And because the receiver must receive twice the bandwidth of SSB, it receives additional noise as well, so it has a worse signal-to-noise ratio than doubling the power of a regular SSB signal.)</p>

<p>This mode <em>would</em> help with some types of noise sources — for example, broadband impulses like those a <em>noise blanker</em> is used against, but that type of noise isn't common enough to motivate modes for its sake.</p>

<p>But if you and a friend have open-source SDR transceivers, maybe it's worth experimenting with! Just remember that you're using twice the bandwidth, and don't use it on a crowded band.</p>

<p>I'd think so, as long as you also then rotate all the results 25 degrees in the opposite direction. I can't think of anything that actually wouldn't rotate with the ground (gravity, geomagnetic field, ...) that would have any significant effects.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Does it really matter?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No doubt the 25 degree slant will significantly affect many antenna designs. Not only will you have a hard time transmitting through a mountain, but the <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/a/487/218"">ground will form an image antenna</a> as if it were a mirror, creating a phased array. Turning the mirror 25 degrees will make a big difference.</p>

<p>Of course, probably there's nothing you can do about it. Maybe you will feel better not knowing.</p>

<p>Besides, there are plenty of other things that can make a big difference. Modeling results can be very wrong if they don't include everything near the antenna: the tower, the feedline, your gutters, trees, etc. Ground conductivity can change with weather. Then, the ionosphere swirls around and messes the whole thing up. So, from a practical standpoint, modeling can only solve some of the problems involved with making a good antenna.</p>

<p>My personal approach would not bother with modeling. I have a <a href=""http://www.dxengineering.com/parts/hsr-4btv"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">trapped vertical</a> that wasn't too expensive and covers enough bands that one of them is always open. If you have the space, a couple of parallel-fed simple dipoles would probably work as well for less cost. I put in plenty of radials to keep the ground losses low, and tuned it carefully. The idea is to focus on radiating, and not where I'm radiating. I wouldn't win any DX contests, but I have no difficulty making an international contact any day.</p>

I've seen restrictions for transmitting data, like packet and ATV, but, for example, could I legally use a huge bandwidth like 500 kHz to transmit FM in the 2 meter band?</p>

<p>For example, studying for the extra class exam, I saw this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The maximum bandwidth for data emission on 60 meters is 2.8kHz.</p>
</blockquote>
","<p>Mostly, on HF, the FCC has chosen to limit modes of transmission and symbol rates rather than bandwidth (60 Meters is the exception, where they have limited both bandwidth and mode). For instance, you are currently allowed to use FM only on 29MHz and above, regardless of the bandwidth used. But on VHF and above, there are no legal limitations of bandwidth.</p>

<p>So technically, yes, if you had a wide deviation FM transmitter you could use it on 2 meters. Although as I'm sure you know this would be very irresponsible [but not illegal according to current FCC rules.] </p>

<p>On 10GHz and similar high bands with tons of space, it is commonplace to use wideband FM (normally a bandwidth of 200-300kHz). This allows equipment to be used with less than optimal frequency stability (which is very difficult to obtain at those high frequencies). </p>

I would like to remove the LED and use a small panel meter instead.</p>

<ul>
<li>I don't have a 1N34A at hand, but I do have a 1N4148. It seems to work fine. What kind of characteristics do I need for D1? Could I use a 1N4148 instead?</li>
<li>Would I still need C1? It seems to work fine without.</li>
<li>How do I calculate the value of R4?</li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DOE6M.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>First, consider how the circuit works. It's a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheatstone_bridge"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wheatstone bridge</a>, although you might have to squint and turn your head to see it. Think about how ""Tune"" is a connection to ground through what should be a 50 ohm impedance. Here it is redrawn a bit:</p>



<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bD0WZ.png"" alt=""schematic""></p>



<p><sup><a href=""/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fbD0WZ.png"">simulate this circuit</a> &ndash; Schematic created using <a href=""https://www.circuitlab.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">CircuitLab</a></sup></p>

<p>When the antenna is tuned, then R2 and R3 make a voltage divider, and R1 and the antenna make a similar voltage divider. As the input is driven by the transmitter, the nodes between each of these voltage dividers are at the same voltage (because they are each the same voltage divider), and thus there's no voltage across T1.</p>

<p>When the antenna isn't 50 ohms, then it is not the same voltage divider as R2 and R3, and so there is voltage across T1.</p>

<p>The bit with the other half of T1 and the LED is essentially an AM detector. Think of it like this:</p>



<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/60DZk.png"" alt=""schematic""></p>



<p><sup><a href=""/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2f60DZk.png"">simulate this circuit</a></sup></p>

<p>D1 rectifies the input: when V1 is at its maximum the diode permits current to raise the voltage of node <em>A</em> by charging C1. When V1 swings back down the diode is reversed biased so the only path for current out of C1 is through R4 and the LED. So the voltage at A is approximately the peak voltage of the voltage source.</p>

<p>Of course the voltage source is actually the secondary of T1. The winding ratio of T1 helps to generate a higher voltage for the detector so it's better able to overcome the forward voltage of the diodes.</p>

<p>The selection of D1 isn't terribly critical. Anything that rectifies will work here. Even a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxhole_radio"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">razor blade could work</a>. Ideally it will have a low forward voltage and a fast recovery time, but if it doesn't it just means it will be harder to light the LED, so you may not be able to tune as precisely. 1N34A is a germanium diode which has a lower forward voltage (around 0.3V) than silicon diodes (around 0.65V). Germanium diodes are an antique item these days. You might have better luck finding a Schottky diode, and it will probably work better too.</p>

<p>But if a 1N4148 is what you have and it works acceptably, then go with that. Nothing bad will happen.</p>

<p>You don't strictly need C1 either, but it might make the LED brighter. Without C1 the LED will only blink, but with C1 it can charge up and power the LED though the entire AC cycle. You can also think about how C1 lowers the AC impedance of the detector circuit, enabling it to draw more power and thus make the LED brighter.</p>

<p>Calculating R4 is pretty noncritical. You want something that's high enough to limit the current through the LED so it doesn't go up in smoke, but low enough that the LED is bright enough to see. Ideally you want the time constant of R4 and C1 to be long relative to the frequency so the capacitor doesn't discharge much between cycles. But the time constant shouldn't be so long the LED continues glowing long after you've reached a good tuning.</p>

<p>Now it should be apparent how you might adapt this circuit for use with a panel meter. Depending on the kind of meter you have and how sensitive it is, you might even forgo the transformer, and instead put the meter in place of T1's primary in series with a rectifying diode. Otherwise you might play with the winding ratio of T1 to make good use of the meter's range, and you can replace R4 and D2 with the meter.</p>

"ISM band bandwidth compared to other bands for theoretical WLAN use, performance?","105","","<p>As a purely theoretical question, what would it be like if wireless computer networking equipment was redesigned and allowed to operate at some other band than the unlicensed ISM band which is presently used? Some other band means in this context a ""better"" band, as in some licensed band considered to be ""better"" than the ISM band. E.g. the cellular band used for cell phones, which are allowed to transmit at higher power levels. </p>

<p>This is not a question regarding the politics or cost involved in licensing these bands and it should be ignored completely for this question to try keep things more simple.</p>

<p>By wireless networking I mean the typical 802.11* variants, which of course would have to be redesigned at the physical layer to work with a different band.</p>

<p>By ""what it would be like"" I mean:</p>

<ul>
<li>A) What would the end result in difference in theoretical bandwidth be?</li>
<li>B) How would it affect power savings in terms of better SNR?</li>
<li>C) How is MIMO affected? Is MIMO more easy to implement and exploit on some radio bands than others?</li>
</ul>

<p>For A) I'm assuming that using the Shannon-Hartley theorem would work:</p>

<p>$C = Blog_2(1 + \dfrac{S}{N})$</p>

<p>If only I knew what bandwidth $B$ to pick and what the electrical engineering considerations to take into account would be. I'm assuming that you could use a very wide arbitrary band just to improve your theoretical results, but it would be costly engineering wise? Just to answer a theoretical question like this, how would you even determine what frequency range would be ""realistic"" in this context? Would you simply have to pick some arbitrary range, which also renders the question itself meaningless? If this is the case, then simply assume that the cellular frequencies were suddenly available for use, or even all of the UHF band if that is easier to answer.</p>

<p>As for the S/N ratio, I'm assuming that when moving away from the ISM band, it becomes more safe (without getting into the debate regarding possible harm from cell phones), and simply increasing the transmission power would also allow for higher bandwidth. However it would also cause more noise for everyone else?</p>

<p>B) I'm assuming this is directly related to A, as some frequency ranges have different properties in terms of transmittance, absorption and reflectance? In addition there would probably be interference from other devices on some bands which are strictly speaking not intended as radio transmitters, e.g. microwave ovens for the ISM band.</p>

<p>C) For this, I don't know. I know MIMO is a big and essential part of the physical layer for modern WLANs, but I don't know how it relates to different frequency bands. Is part of the reason MIMO is used simply that the transmission power is so limited on ISM, and that the band has other limitations/issues to deal with?</p>
","<p>You don't need to ask this as a theoretical question, because it already exists. The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/13-centimeter_band"" rel=""nofollow"">13-centimeter band</a> overlaps the 2.4 GHz ISM band used by Wi-Fi. A licensed amateur can operate Wi-Fi equipment on the standard channels at a higher power, or operate on channels outside of the ISM band (but still in the amateur band allocation) if the equipment supports it. Consumer equipment usually does not (without hardware modifications), but a lot of professional hardware does, as there are commercial licenses that grant RF privileges beyond the ISM limitations also.</p>

<p>Plenty of people have done exactly this. See <a href=""http://www.broadband-hamnet.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">HSMM</a>.</p>

<p>As for what effect this has, the Shannon-Hartley theorem is indeed the right tool to model the ideal behavior, which isn't far off from real behavior. Operating at a higher power increases the $S/N$ term (by increasing $S$), allowing a higher channel capacity to be sustained over a long distance, or being more able to overpower noise (be it natural or man-made).</p>

<p>Moving outside of the ISM band also increases the $S/N$ term, but instead by reducing $N$, simply because there are so many unlicensed Wi-Fi APs, cordless phones, and microwave ovens operating in the ISM band. Moving out of the ISM band, you avoid a whole ton of man-made interference.</p>

<p>The bandwidth ($B$) refers to the channel bandwidth, and this will be defined by the modulation. For example, Wi-Fi uses 20 MHz or 40 MHz channels depending on device configuration. PSK31 requires about 31 Hz, SSB about 4 kHz, and the FM used on amateur VHF about 15 kHz.</p>

<p>Regulations permitting, you can make the bandwidth as large as you want. If you can maintain the same signal-to-noise ratio, then the Shannon-Hartley theorem says that you can have increased channel capacity. However, increasing the channel bandwidth also increases noise power. If you double the bandwidth, then there is twice as much noise power within that bandwidth. If you don't also double your transmit power, you are decreasing the signal-to-noise ratio.</p>

<p>If you make the bandwidth wide enough, you will need to significantly redesign the antenna, filters, and other components. There are a class of modulations that work in this mode. Check out <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-wideband"" rel=""nofollow"">ultra-wideband</a> (UWB) and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spread_spectrum"" rel=""nofollow"">spread-spectrum</a> (SS). You will also have to solve the problem of how multiple users can share the wide swatch of spectrum you are now monopolizing, and if you read about UWB and SS you will see they each have different techniques for accomplishing that.</p>

<p>MIMO is a complex collection of techniques, and as such it's difficult to point to any one reason why it's used. It's certainly not the case that MIMO is useful only in power-limited ISM bands. As a counter-example, modern radar uses <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phased_array"" rel=""nofollow"">phased arrays</a> instead of mechanically steered antennas, and these are some of the highest power transmitters in the world that <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_YAL-1"" rel=""nofollow"">don't qualify as weapons</a>.</p>

<p>The techniques in MIMO are also applicable to any frequency. Shifting wireless networking to any other frequency would only affect MIMO to the extent that it affects radio communication in general. For example, if frequency is high enough, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_propagation#Absorption"" rel=""nofollow"">Earth's atmosphere becomes quite absorbent</a>, and radio communication becomes difficult.</p>

(Mutual coupling is an another problem, but I can forget about that for now.) I am not sure how well these antennas will perform if I operate them on higher frequencies, say, in the 900MHz range. What could I expect if I do this? Are there any alternatives, if I want to place multiple antennas close together?</p>
","<p>If your goal is simply to gain height, why not mount multiple properly-sized antennas on a single mast? At 900 MHz, the antennas and a structure to hold them sufficiently far apart from each other would be quite small and light, so you don't need anything structurally complex. A prototype could be built out of wood, wire, cable-ties/screws/tape/glue, and whatever sort of 8' long object you can scrounge up.</p>

<p>And it will be unnecessarily hard to rig 8' long antennas to maintain specific phase (hence distance) relationships on the scale of inches!</p>

However, it appears this band is not allocated in Europe (ITU Region 1) and may exceed your maximum output power limits - so you may not be able to use this specific model of hobby radio modem in your location. This is simply the only one I know because I am in Canada.</p>

<p>For Europe you should look for a comparable model in the 70cm (433 Mhz) band such as the <a href=""http://store.openpilot.org/modems/23-oplink-mini.html"" rel=""nofollow"">PipX</a> (only 100 mw). However the additional limitation on output power may limit operational range.</p>

<p>In that case you may need to look into building an antenna tracker for use with a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yagi-Uda_antenna"" rel=""nofollow"">highly directional antenna such as a yagi</a>. This involves transmitting the GPS co-ordinates down the link and having the antenna tracker point the antenna straight at the target. This may be somewhat experimental if you are moving at 200 km/h - I think you will need to custom build your antenna tracker, perhaps taking into account the average falling speed and any latency in the motor controller and anticipating the targets future position.</p>

<p>Eitherway, experimentation is part of the hobby of amateur radio! So if you do decide to take this on, publish your project progress somewhere for all to enjoy.</p>

"Comparing antenna effeciency","101","","<p>Let's say I have three dipoles, one is resonant at some frequency and is matched at the antenna, the second is shortened with loading coals and is also matched at the antenna, the third is shortened but has no loading coils and is also matched at the antenna.</p>

<p>Supposing that all three are matched to 50 ohms and I use a short (ish) piece of coax to the antenna, how would they perform with regard to efficiency, gain, etcetera?</p>

<hr>

<p>Assuming at least a half wavelength above ground at the same location, only one antenna installed at a time.</p>
","<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antenna_efficiency"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Antenna efficiency</a> can be defined as the ratio of the radiation resistance to the total resistance of the antenna (radiation resistance, plus ohmic resistance of the antenna, plus ground losses, etc), normalized to the feedpoint impedance. If radiation resistance is the only resistance in the antenna, then it's 100% efficient.</p>

<p>$$ \text{efficiency} = \frac{R_\text{radiation}}{R_\text{radiation} + R_\text{ohmic} + R_\text{ground}+R_\text{any other kind}} $$</p>

<p>Performing this calculation can be tricky since there are so many potential sources of loss which may not be thought of as a ""resistance"", but can be expressed as such. Dielectric losses are a good example.</p>

<p>Loading coils and matching networks are significant only to the extent that they introduce additional loss. Sources of loss might include:</p>

<ul>
<li>resistive losses in the coils</li>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_hysteresis"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">magnetic hysteresis</a> losses in the core material of inductors</li>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectric_loss"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">dielectric losses</a> in capacitors</li>
<li>unintentional near-field coupling to nearby lossy materials (mast, trees, etc)</li>
</ul>

<p>Shortening the antenna tends to decrease the radiation resistance. This doesn't make the antenna less efficient itself: it just makes other losses more significant, since they are now a greater fraction of the effective total resistance of the antenna.</p>

<p>It doesn't matter much if you use loading coils or ""some sort of matching network"". Loading coils <em>are</em> a matching network. If you take the loading coils out, your matching network, if at the feedpoint near where the loading coils would have been, will be an inductance of similar value. What matters is the losses you introduce with whatever matching technique you use. You can make very good loading coils that introduce no significant losses (fat, low resistance wire around a low-loss core like air), or you can make very poor coils that turn your antenna into a heater (very thin wire around a lossy iron core).</p>

<p>Shortening a dipole has a very small effect on the radiation pattern. As the dipole becomes shorter, it becomes less like a half-wave dipole and more like a <a href=""http://www.antenna-theory.com/antennas/shortdipole.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hertzian dipole</a>. Wikipedia provides <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipole_antenna"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a nice graphical comparison of radiation patterns</a>, with the half-wave dipole as a solid line, and the Hertzian dipole as a dashed line:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PlRpR.png"" alt=""comparison of dipole radiation patterns""></p>

<p>As you can see, the half-wave dipole has a marginally higher <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directivity"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">directivity</a>, but they are close enough that for most practical concerns they can be considered identical.</p>

"Antenna experimentation","100","","<p>I want to make a DIY antenna for my Kenwood TH-F6A.  Is there any danger of damaging the radio (i.e. by trying an antenna that is unsuitable), or is it safe to experiment?</p>
","<p>If you're making a simple, tried and true design like a dipole, quarter-wave vertical, or ground plane and you measure and build it reasonably carefully from properly calculated plans, there's absolutely nothing to worry about at the power levels an HT outputs. But that may not be what you mean by experimenting, really, so I assume you want to do more than that.</p>

<p>There is some danger of damaging any radio with an unsuitable antenna. ""Unsuitable"" can mean lots of things, but usually the damaging thing is that an impedance mismatch between the antenna and feedline or an antenna which is hopelessly far from resonant on the desired frequency causes too much of the transmitted signal to be reflected back into the radio. Again, a low power HT won't be putting out enough power to cause damage in most cases, and modern radios have some built-in protection against such damage, but to be safe with a truly experimental antenna you probably want to invest in an SWR meter, which gives an indication of the reflected power.</p>

<p>The resistor should be half the system impedance, so 25Ω for a 50Ω system. I'll assume a 50Ω system for the rest of the description.</p>

<p>P1 sees the loads on P2 and P3 in series. If we assume all loads are 50Ω, P2 and P3 in series are 100Ω. Setting the turns ratio with 10 on the P1 side and 14 with a center tap on the other side (with a center tap) makes makes a 1:2 step-down transformer (because $10^2 / 14^2 \approx 1/2$). Thus, P1 sees a matched 50Ω.</p>

<p>P2 sees the matched load at P1 but through a 1:2 step-down transformer (25Ω) in series with another (25Ω) to see a net 50Ω matched load. Thus, signal from P2 is equally divided between being across P1 and the resistor. P3 sees this voltage across the resistor, but it also sees the voltage across P1 in antiphase. These two cancel such that a signal applied at P2 does not appear at P3.</p>

<p>The cost of this isolation is a loss of half the signal power from P2 or P3. For a receive application this may be negligible provided the receiver noise floor is significantly below the (additionally attenuated) received RF noise floor.</p>

","<p>Generally the RTTY Bandwidth is  170 hz, So if the frequency on your transceiver reads 14082.00 Khz  - the lower part of the RTTY signal is at 14082.00 Khz - 170 hz which is 14081.83.</p>

<p>That frequency allocation is being <strong>used</strong>, now if you have very good filters in your ""rig"" - then you could in theory operate very very close to this frequency  - i.e. 14082.4 (that would be your Mark... the lower end would be 14082.230) which would leave a theorectical gap of aprox 400 Hz....</p>

<p>If the other station has <strong>No Frequency Variation</strong> and all the people calling them are also very careful - you will not have any issues.... assuming of course that your HF Transceiver has good Filters and Image Rejection.</p>

<p>Alas lots of stations just use pure <strong>power</strong> and literally burn away the edges....</p>

<p>What would I use ? On a non Contest day 500 hz is easily enough - but for CQWW-RTTY ... you will not have any space in the digital allocation - and the quest for <strong>power</strong> plus <strong>filters</strong> will become more significant.</p>

<p>If there is a DX station, and I note that you have said a <strong>rare DX</strong> station - then there is always the possibility that they will work a split, i.e. receive on 1 frequency and transmit on another (hence most/all(?) modern transceivers have 2 VFOs). The size (gap/distance) of the split is totally down to the DX operators choice, whilst this is very common in CW and SSB modes, it is less common in RTTY from what I have observed. In CW a split of +1-2Khz and SSB +3-5Khz. You however need to ensure that you are keeping your signal inside the allocated band, and (US Bands) adhere to the band plan if applicable.</p>

<p>If the DX station has been going for several minutes (and the DX Cluster will indicate that clearly) - and they do have a split - respect that. If they are working SIMPLEX (1 Frequency) then my 500hz offset is more than enough.</p>

<p>Some clever ops - deliberately position themselves close to DX stations - so those people who have been trying to get the DX and who can not (lack of Power/Ant/Propagation etc), and who are disappointed/frustrated so they try their luck for another station (just checking there is something coming out of the antenna). </p>

<p>Yes. Tuners <em>can</em> help with receiving with an antenna of an otherwise unsuitable length, but it is absolutely worth trying without them.</p>

<p>Here's a useful rule: Watch the spectrum and unplug the antenna. If this causes the visible signal level all across the spectrum to go down, then you had plenty of signal from the antenna and there is no need to improve it.</p>

<p>If it did <em>not</em> go down very much, then you'll get better reception by improving your antenna system — whether by an antenna of a different length, a tuner, a LNA, or another means.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><strong>DO NOT</strong> wire a separate 5 V supply, whether battery or otherwise, into your USB connection unless you are willing to risk damaging the USB port/motherboard you plug it into by back-feeding power to it.</p>

<p>Can a 1A station qualify for the ""Alternate Power"" bonus?</p>
","<p>Of course you get the 100 points. You only used one transmitter, so there wasn't an issue of using more than your classification allowed.</p>

<p>What the next-to-last sentence of that paragraph is getting at, somewhat sloppily, is operations that only used alternate power briefly to make their 5 QSOs. For example, our group was 2A, using two transmitters full time under emergency power from a generator. For about an hour we took one of those transmitters off the emergency power and connected it to solar-charged batteries for the Alternate Power bonus. If we had kept going with two transmitters and added an alternate power transmitter we would have been using three transmitters, violating our 2A classification.</p>

","<blockquote>
  <p>How do cell phone filters filter out all the extraneous EM waves and noise (especially noise) when you get a call?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Short answer: they don't. Of course, they use a bandpass filter to reject EM radiation outside the designated channel. But every radio does that. Modern cell phones also dynamically adjust their antennas so they are more sensitive in the direction of the cell tower, and less sensitive to other directions where there's only noise. But after that, there's still plenty of noise mixed with the signal.</p>

<p>If you're wondering why you don't <em>hear</em> the noise in the call, why it doesn't sound like a distant AM radio station in a thunderstorm, it's because the transmissions are digital. It's the same reason when you download an MP3 over WiFi it doesn't sound noisy. It's the same reason I can show you a number:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VmBQi.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VmBQi.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>And you see forty-two, not fcrtv-lwo.</p>

<p>There is a point at which there's enough noise that the numbers can't be reliably decoded, and you do hear noise in the call. But it doesn't sound like static, because a wrong number in a digital audio doesn't sound like static. Because cell phones are used for voice, the digital coding is based on what voices sound like. The digital signal contains instructions for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocoder"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">reproducing a human voice not unlike a human would do it</a>. So when the bits are wrong, it doesn't sound like static: it sounds like a voice making nonsense sounds.</p>

<p>When the signal isn't great, a few of these errors slip in, but you don't notice them because you're paying attention to what's being said, not the audio quality. And, the codec is designed to make such things difficult to notice. For example, when a few bits of data are missing, the codec may continue making the same sound that it was making before the error to fill in the gap. Such things are difficult to notice unless you listen carefully.</p>

<p>When a lot of errors slip in, the phone just drops the call so you hear nothing at all.</p>

"Relay specifications for linked dipole","94","","<p>I currently have a linked dipole up and running at 40,20,15 and 10M. While I have looked at trapped dipoles the losses discourage me as I wish to use as little power as possible. </p>

<p>So I now I'm wanting to put in latching relays instead of the banana links, but I'm unsure of what specifications I need. 
As they will be at the end of each dipole,  where the voltage is high and current is low I have guessed that high voltage might be a necessity. 
Hope to get some insights on this, and if it's doable. </p>
","<p>Interesting idea. Here's a start: <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/questions/1410/what-is-the-peak-voltage-at-the-tips-of-a-dipole-antenna"">What is the peak voltage at the tips of a dipole antenna?</a></p>

<p>The conclusion there is for a 100W transmitter and a ""normal"" dipole, you can expect a peak of about +/-900V relative to ground at the dipole ends. You'll want to pad that with a healthy safety margin. Also keep in mind that power is proportional to the square of voltage, so if you have more than 100 watts that voltage can get very high, very fast.</p>

<p>As the relays are closed and they find themselves somewhere in the middle of the dipole, they'll have to deal with the current. Current is highest at the feedpoint, so in the worst case, for a 100W transmitter the current is $ \sqrt{100\:\mathrm(W) / 72\:\Omega} = 1.8\:\mathrm A$. In practice lower, since the relay is not at the feedpoint. This is an upper bound.</p>

<p>You'll want to be sure the relays don't switch while transmitting. I'd imagine there'd be some arcing and the contacts would wear out quickly.</p>

<p>I suspect the bigger challenge will be controlling the relays, since being on a wire with 100 watts of RF is a little tricky. Not only do you need to get the wires to them to control them, but once you've got the wires there you'll need to devise a way to keep the RF out of the control wires and the relay coils.</p>

<p>I've never done this, and I can't find descriptions by anyone who has, but I might try using twin-lead as the antenna element. The common-mode current radiates as a dipole normally would, while you can use the differential mode to control a DPDT relay.</p>

<p>The trouble then is the mechanism to control both common and differential modes from the shack. You don't want to put common-mode RF on the feedline: that would make it an antenna. If only you had a 3rd wire...</p>

<p>If you use a folded dipole, you can make one. At the center of what would normally be the undriven element is ""ground"". You can just attach a wire there. And if ""ground"" is actually DC +12V, you can use that to control the relay coils.</p>

"How can Ground Penetrating Radar work?","93","","<p>I was reading about <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground-penetrating_radar"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GPR devices</a> recently.</p>

<p>Considering the operation frequency of these devices, how they can go that deep (up to 50 feet)?  Normally you would only expect a Hz to KHz range signal to go that deep into the ground.</p>
","<p>There is a special adaptation of the Friis equation, called the Radar Equation, that describes the range of a radar system. Here is a <em>basic</em> version that calculates the maximum range of a radar system:</p>

<p>$$R_{max}=\sqrt[4] {\frac {P_tG^2\lambda^2\sigma}{P{_{r(min)}}*(4\pi)^3*L}} \tag 1$$</p>

<p>where $R_{max}$ is the maximum range in meters, $P_t$ is the transmit power in watts, $G$ is the linear gain the combined transmit and receive antenna, $\lambda$ is the wavelength in meters of the frequency, $\sigma$ is the effective radar target cross section in square meters, $P_{r(min)}$ is the minimum receiver power required in watts, and $L$ is a linear loss factor to consolidate all losses other than free space effects encountered in the radar path.</p>

<p>So if we take a 2 GHz radar (0.15 meters) with 10 watts of transmit power, a receiver with 0.25 $\mu$V of sensitivity (1.25e<sup>-15</sup> watts for a 50 ohm system), an antenna with a linear gain of 31.6 (15 dBi), a 1 square meter metal target and no other path losses, we calculate a maximum effective distance of 3,085 meters (10,121 feet).</p>

<p>We would now need to account for the losses of earth (rock, soils, sands and water) to apply this to a ground penetrating radar. This can be factored into $L$ in equation 1. I do not have data at hand to suggest what the possible attenuation factors would be for various forms of earth so instead, it may be instructive to rework equation 1 to solve for the maximum attenuation that can be accommodated over a specified distance:</p>

<p>$$L={\frac {P_tG^2\lambda^2\sigma}{P{_{r(min)}}*(4\pi)^3*R_{max}^4}} \tag 2$$</p>

<p>If we set $R_{max}$ to 15.24 meters (50 feet) as questioned by the OP and leave all other parameters the same, we find that an additional path loss ($L$) of ~92 dB (~1.68e<sup>9</sup> linear attenuation) could be accommodated before the radar would not be able to detect a signal from a 1 meter square metal target 15.24 meters below the surface.</p>

<p>So armed with these basic formulas, one can run various ""what if"" scenarios to get a sense of what is possible. Do keep in mind that this is a very simplified form of the radar equation that does not 'reflect' (pun intended) all of the factors involved.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

","<p>You didn't mention which country you're in, but in the US, it is only legal to transmit on CB with a ""type-accepted"" radio.  In other words, the manufacturer of the radio must apply to the FCC for permission to sell the model.  It's not legal to build your own CB transmitter.</p>

<p>Regarding using a single antenna for multiple bands, a transmitter typically expects the antenna to have a certain impedance.  It is possible to use a single antenna for multiple bands, but in that case a simple antenna will have quite a wide variety of impedances across the multiple bands.  For a very low-powered transmitter this may not pose a problem.  For higher-powered transmitters, a mismatched load can cause very high voltages that can easily damage the transmitter.  (Modern high-powered transmitters often include a circuit to automatically reduce power when a mismatch is detected, to protect the electronics.)  Another problem is that the efficiency of the transmitter and the feedline can vary considerably if the frequency strays far from the optimal range.</p>

<p>How to design an antenna and feedline system for a wide range of frequencies deserves to be a separate question here, but let me say that the most economical solution to the problem is often to have separate antennas and a coaxial switch to choose between them.</p>

<p>Now let's try to calculate the number. I'll take the frequency to be 145.5 MHz, which is a bit below the optimal range for the use of this model. The given height is 3 stories plus roof, so I'll round that to 10 meters.</p>

<p>First, the correction factor:</p>

<p>$$ \begin{align}
C_h &amp;= 8.29\left(\log_{10} \left(1.54 \cdot \frac{10 \ \mathrm{m}}{1 \ \mathrm{m}}\right)\right)^2 - 1.1 \\
    &amp;= 10.6 \ \mathrm{dB}
\end{align} $$</p>

<p>Next, the main formula:</p>

<p>$$ L_{50}
=69.55
+26.16 \cdot \log_{10}\left(\frac{145.5 \ \mathrm{MHz}}{1 \ \mathrm{MHz}}\right)
-13.82 \cdot \log_{10}\left(\frac{10 \ \mathrm{m}}{1 \ \mathrm{m}}\right)
-10.6
+\left(44.9-6.55 \cdot \log_{10}\left(\frac{10 \ \mathrm{m}}{1 \ \mathrm{m}}\right)\right) \log_{10}\left(\frac{7 \ \mathrm{km}}{1 \ \mathrm{km}}\right) $$
$$L_{50}=69.55+56.58-13.82-10.6+38.35 \cdot 0.85 $$
$$L_{50}=134.3 \ \mathrm{dB}$$</p>

<p>So what does this number give us and how is it helpful?</p>

<p>The antennas are given as 7 dB Yagi, so I'll take that to be 7 dBi and I'll assume that you have 10 m of say RG-8 coaxial cable (a calculator gives me 0.5 dB loss for that) and that you're transmitting at 35 W. </p>

<p>The transmitter <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalent_isotropically_radiated_power"" rel=""nofollow"">EIRP</a> would be then:</p>

<p>$$P_{tx}
=10 \cdot \log_{10}\left(\frac{35\mathrm W}{1\mathrm W}\right)
+7-0.5
=21.94\:\mathrm{dBW}
=51.94\:\mathrm{dBm}$$</p>

<p>Our estimate of path loss is 134.3 dB and we have a same Yagi at the receiver plus same coax losses. This gives us received power of:
$$P_{rx}=51.94-134.3+7-0.5=-75.86 \ \mathrm{dBm}$$
which should be above S9 at the receiver, if my calculations are correct and the S-meter is properly calibrated. </p>

<p>I hope that my description of the process will let you do your own more exact calculations and help you a bit.</p>

"Ferrite rod permeability determination","92","","<p>Is there a simple empiric way of determining the permeability (mhu) of a ferrite object (be it a ring, rod or any form)?</p>

<p>I've been thinking this for a rod: if I wind coils with different number of turns (same wire, just wind or unwind it) and measure the inductance, then given the number of turns, diameter of the rod and ""height"" of the coil I would be able to determine the permeability. I tried a couple of times but I'm getting inconsistent results. My LCR meter can measure only upwards of 0,01mH (or 10uH). Is the meter the culprit or is my method flawed?</p>
","<p>you're on the right track to measure/calculate effective permeability.  </p>

<p>However, you need to use an inductance meter that can measure up to 1 nH accurately or so.  If you're trying to use one of those $25 LCR meters , it won't have the accuracy or precision you require, plus you won't be able to zero it.   Another issue is that you'll have a wide variance in results due to the wire, winding, lengths, etc - see Silvio's comments at <a href=""http://www.sklaic.info/forum/index.php?topic=175.0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.sklaic.info/forum/index.php?topic=175.0</a> . </p>

<p>The other method is to measure frequency resonance, by using the loop as the inductor in an LC circuit.  Put a known capacitor in series with the loop, and then use a frequency generator and frequency counter to measure the resonance (peak) frequency of the LC circuit. </p>

"UHF Into VHF Power Amplifier","92","","<p>What would be the result of accidentally applying a UHF signal to a VHF power amplifier? Say a 70cm transmission from a dual-band 2 meter / 70 cm radio into a 2 meter PA, assuming the input power is within the PA's specs?</p>
","<p>That depends, but generally speaking, your amplifier will just be ""too slow"" to follow the signal, and you'll just get a mishmash of frequencies at the output. Usually, nothing bad would happen (aside from you emitting at frequencies where that's illegal). Nice thing about having energy at the wrong frequencies is that it stays the same energy, even if somehow converted to something amplifiable by the PA. </p>

<p>It really depends on your device, but some amplifiers might even have an input stage with a moderate low-pass characteristic on purpose – you really don't want to amplify harmonics of the intended signal, anyway, so designing an input stage that has some series resistance followed by a shorting capacity comes pretty easy (or accidentally, actually), and that's only for the better. In this case, your UHF signal will possibly already be canceled when it would reach the main gain stages.</p>

<p>Note that things might look a bit different for very sensitive amplifiers, or in situations where your tone might lead to nonlinearities mixing down energy from formerly out-of-band into your amplifiers operational range.</p>

<p>All in all: Be safe. Have filters. In this particular case, having an RC actually is easy enough :)</p>

"What is shape factor of a resonant circuit?","92","","<p>I have seen the shape factor of a resonant circuit defined in different places as <em>both</em> ""the ratio of the -<strong>3</strong>dB point to the -60dB point"", and elsewhere as ""the ratio of the -<strong>6</strong>dB point to the -60dB point"". Please, which of these is correct? I can see why the -3dB point is special, it's where the reactance equals the resistance, (approximately, near enough in practice for high Q) but why -6dB?</p>

<p>(there doesn't seem to be a tag that is closely relevant, sorry)</p>
","<p>Well, different books / schools use different definitions.</p>

<p>Some authors just copy definitions from others and make mistakes when doing that. In this case, this is pretty likely: </p>

<p>Possibly, someone remembered ""hey, shape factor is between the point where there's half the power and -60dB of the power"", then when writing down accidentally converted ""half the power"" to ""half the amplitude"", and thus used $x [\text{dB}] = 20 \log_{10}(x[\text{linear}])$, as usual for amplitudes, instead of $10\log_{10}$, or just the other way around. The ""original"" definition might be lost in the sands of time.</p>

<p>All in all, <em>shape factor</em> is not a measure encountered all that often in modern literature; especially since analog filters typically have to compete with digital ones nowadays, it's become far more usual since about the 80's to refer to <em>transition width</em> or <em>transition band</em>, ie. the bandwidth between edge of passband (i.e. -3dB point, typically), and the point where the filter response crosses it's final/design attenuation the first time:</p>

<p>This figure is taken from the <a href=""https://mathworks.com/help/signal/examples/practical-introduction-to-digital-filter-design.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mathworks example</a> on filter design:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8Ubdk.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8Ubdk.png"" alt=""filter amplitude response naming""></a></p>

<p>I wonder what sense it makes to use a fixed -60dB as reference, anyway – if your filter is designed to have a -60dB attenuation everywhere in the stopband, fine, that makes sense, but you don't generally do that. What if your filter requirements are really just -50dB (and that makes a large difference, both when designing analog and <a href=""https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/31066/how-many-taps-does-an-fir-filter-need/31077"">digital filters</a>), and you don't actually care where the attenuation becomes -60dB (or whether that happens at all). Or what if you need a great filter because you're observing something extremely weak and go through lengths and build a -90dB-stopband filter? What use is knowing the ratio of -3dB and -60dB then?</p>

<p>The -60dB measure does make kind of sense in a technological environment where -60dB is actually the maximum physically possible isolation (and that's the case for board-bound electronics, and ""free flying low frequency filters"", maybe), but that doesn't really apply to all filter designers do nowadays.</p>

<p>I know I'm kind of annoying like that, but if you're really after having good filters: don't design them in the analog domain. It's 2016. Dynamic ranges of ADCs are plenty, by far more than what you need even with strong interferers, together with the fact that Ham bandwidths are negligible small for modern ADC bandwidths. Build an easy filter that makes sure you don't get aliases in your desired bandwidth when sampling with a certain $f_\text{sample}$, then use digital filters (for example: in your PC) to extract the signals you care about – digital filters can be made virtually infinitely steep, and the noise they might contribute due to calculation accuracy is far below anything relevant for almost all use cases, if not totally overspecified.</p>

"Can I use an RG-8X crimper/stripper on LMR-240?","91","","<p>From all my reading online it seems LMR-240 and RG-8X are only about .002 inches apart in diameter and most connectors/tools that support one support the other.

<p>For example, I am considering <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00HDPA4XI"" rel=""nofollow"">this crimper</a> (as well as <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0012YO78Y"" rel=""nofollow"">this other one</a>) and <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00HDPIG4C"" rel=""nofollow"">this stripper</a>.</p>

<p>To determine the crimper you need, you'll want to find the datasheet for the connectors you will be using.

"Can you create a radio beam with a Faraday cage?","90","","<p>Imagine we have an isotropic antenna at the origin emitting a steady sine wave at frequency $f$. Encompassing the antenna is a sphere of radius $r$ made of a fine copper mesh (with holes $\ll\frac\lambda{10}$, making it a Faraday cage). </p>

<p>From this sphere we remove a patch of material of size $n^{\circ}\times n^{\circ}$.</p>

<p>What would the far-field pattern look like? Is there any combination of the variables ($f$, $r$, $n$) that would create a tight beam from the removed patch of material? What if instead of removing a patch of material we removed a slit from pole to pole with width $n^{\circ}$?</p>
","<p>No, there would not be a narrow beam.</p>

<p>There's multiple ways you can show that, but most intuitively, I think is the follow:</p>

<ul>
<li>consider every point on that patch to be a source of an elemental wave</li>
<li>in the center of that patch, these will interfere in a manner so that only the ""straight"" radial path has a propagating wave front. (think about it: if it wasn't straight, then it would destructively interfere with the neighboring wave sources, which excludes anything but straight)

<ul>
<li>even this alone would not lead to a narrow beam, but simply to a beam with your $n^\circ$ opening angle</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Close to the edges of that patch, however, there's no neighboring sources. So, the propagation happens ""bent away"" from the core of the patch. </li>
</ul>

<p>That phenomenon is called diffraction, and when you think about it, your experiment is just what people usually do to demonstrate diffraction:</p>

<p>Have an experiment with a planar wave front approaching a slotted obstacle. In your case, ""planar"" is to be interpreted with respect to a polar coordinate system with the origin in the center of your sphere, but other than that: classical slit experiment.</p>

<p>In other words, this is basically a patch aperture, and there's nothing about single patch antennas that gives you a narrow beam. To make things worse, the smaller you choose $n$, the wider that beam becomes. </p>

<p>You'd pretty much do the <em>opposite</em> when trying to create a narrow beam (to build an antenna with high directional gain): Finding a surface where the phase difference for plane waves is constant, and other directions quickly experience destructive interference. Take that patch you removed from your mesh sphere, throw away the rest of the sphere, flip the patch inside out, pushing it a bit so that it's parabolic and use it as a reflector. That shape should remind you of an emitter type you might already know:</p>

"Laptop screen goes blank when transmitting from handheld within a few feet - sometimes","90","","<p>I noticed that when I transmit from my handheld Baofeng Radio, with the standard rubber duck antenna, that my laptop screen goes blank.

When in my lap, or on my glass table here at my apartment, it doesn't exhibit this behavior.</p>

<p>ouch.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>As an electrical engineer: that's still a lot of power if just wanted to communicate over a couple meters, but:</p>

<p>If your laptop has any certification (it has, unless you illegally imported it), it should be tolerant to any let's say ""non-malicious"" interference. </p>

<p>So although I've played around with the cheapest Baofengs you can get on amazon.de and <em>saw how terrible the spurs were</em>, I'm pretty sure <em>this should not happen</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My question is if there are standard steps that can be taken to attempt to diagnose what's going on here, and if so, how can I do them without buying a bunch of extra equipment?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, you've diagnosed the problem: The laptop breaks its FCC specification by being susceptible to lawful interference.</p>

<p>Now, if I were in any department of ASUS, I'd be mightily relaxed. As laptop manufacturer, I'd deal with a couple hundred upset customers per day. The least of them have tried to irradiate my devices with so much RF power that things start to fail, and it's (albeit not legally sound, probably, but I'm really not a lawyer) really easy to argue that you <em>just shouldn't operate a strong radio</em> next to electronic equipment. </p>

<p>Therefore, I doubt there will be an engineer sitting down with your laptop model trying to reproduce the issue and nail down the source. However, if he did, he'd probably use exactly your radio first.</p>

<p>The problem here is that you forgot to mention on which frequencies you operate. Radio modelling becomes easy when you're in the <em>far field</em>, ie. radio waves propagate more or less as plane waves, or at least as surfaces of a growing sphere around the transmitter. In the near field, i.e. for distances between transmitting and receiving device below or in the order of single wavelengths, things get a lot more complicated.</p>

<p>So, next thing that engineer would do, if this is far-field, would be record the emissions of your radio (because, reproducibility) and analyse them. He would then either use your radio or some software defined radio (signal generator) to reproduce the waves, and feed them into a highly directional antenna and try to figure out what to point at to cause the outage. </p>

<p>I'd however presume this is near-field. That would make it a lot less worse – because usually, devices don't need to be ""near-field secure"". No-one demands it's safe to operate your laptop right next to a 1 kW HF station :)</p>

<p>So, in that case, I'd take a signal like generated from your radio, use <em>a lot</em> less power, and feed it into a simple dipole (trying to reproduce the mismatch/matching of your rubber ducky antenna and the Baofeng, but measuring that is another task) that I attached to a plastic/wooden arm, to minimize effects of my own body. By observing the SWVR of while I hover the dipole over the device under test, I could find the regions where power couples out of my dipole into parts of the laptop most easily. Then I'd really look at these – it's not too bad if that were e.g. the metal hinges on the laptop screen, and I'd just tell the R&amp;D engineers to take care about that in the ground design of the next laptop.</p>

<p>If, however, something like the very sensitive display signal lines running through the edge of the display absorb relevant energy, and the energy doesn't seem to be absorbed by a ground plane below those, that would actually be a reason to talk to the engineer responsible for that design – for signal lines, proper ground planes are crucial for reliable operation, and the support cases where this, out of sheer bad luck, happens to someone in a situation where he's not holding the radio himself, will cost my company real money.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>this laptop basically falling apart anyway,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ah, so that is a good hint: Check that all the case insides are properly connected to each other. Laptop cases around critical electronic parts are often metallized on the inside and often have small copper springs or sponges with a copper mesh around to make contact when you properly close the case, thus forming an effective shielding. If your laptop lost its mechanical integrity, this effect might be compromised. </p>

<p>The same goes for signal connectors, by the way, and in your case, especially the LVDS connector that goes between mainboard or graphics card and your screen. Digital signal receivers are pretty good these days and might actually work OK with a ""half-connected"" LVDS pair, but if significant interference happens, that might kill the decodability. So check your connections!</p>

"V/U Packet Rate Limits","90","","<p>I'm studying for the General exam and I've encountered some questions about maximum baud rates on various bands. They seem... extremely optimistic. Given the trouble I've had investigating 9600 baud on 2m, I had to wonder if people are actually managing anything like the limits.</p>

<p>Secondarily, how would I go about setting up a 19.6k connection on 2m or a 56.6k connection on 70cm? Are there radios that offer this as a capability, or specific TNCs, or is this just a lot of legal headroom and nobody's actually doing it?</p>
","<p>As mentioned above, you should make a distinction between the legal limits, and the technical feasibility, and the theoretical maxima in rates.</p>

<p>To illustrate: Shannon's channel capacity says that over a channel with bandwidth $B$ and SNR $\frac SN$, you can do at <strong>most</strong> the bit rate $C$:</p>

<p>$$C = B\log_2\left(1+\frac SN\right)\,\text.$$</p>

<p>What Shannon does not say is <em>how</em> you do that, and in fact, that problem is often unsolved, so most transceiver systems stay considerably below that rate limit.</p>

<p>Let us, however, plug in some numbers here of a rather idyllic scenario:</p>

<p>We go for a channel width of $B= 3\,\text{kHz} \approx 35\,\text{dBHz}$, and let's assume some ~S8 scenario, so $S=-80\,\text{dBm}$, as well as letting your receiver run at room temperature and have a Noise Figure $N_F=4\,\text{dB}$:</p>

<p>$$\begin{align}
C &amp;= 3\cdot10^3\frac1{\text s} \cdot\log_2\left(1+\frac{-80\,\text{dBm}}{-174\,\text{dBm/Hz}\cdot 35\,\text{dBHz}\cdot4\,\text{dB}}\right)\\
&amp;= 3\cdot10^3\frac1{\text s} \cdot\log_2\left(1+\frac{-80\,\text{dBm}}{\left(-174+35+4\right)\,\text{dBm}}\right)\\
&amp;= 3\cdot10^3\frac1{\text s} \cdot\log_2\left(1+(-80-(-174+35+4)\,\text{dB})\right)\\
&amp;= 3\cdot10^3\frac1{\text s} \cdot\log_2\left(1+(-80+135)\,\text{dB})\right)\\
&amp;= 3\cdot10^3\frac1{\text s} \cdot\log_2\left(1+55\,\text{dB}\right)\\
&amp;\approx 3\cdot10^3\frac1{\text s} \cdot\log_2\left(10^{5.5}\right)\\
&amp;\approx 3\cdot10^3\frac1{\text s} \cdot18.27\\
&amp;= 54.81\,\text{kb/s}
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>In other words, no matter what modulation, channel code you use, there's no chance you'll get more that 54810 bits per second error-free through that channel. So, restricting you to about $\frac13$ of that still makes no sense from an RF perspective (regulator doesn't actually care how fast you transmit, but how much spectrum you occupy with that), but it's not inherently <em>too</em> optimistic – on a short range scenario, the receive powers might be much higher (calculate Free Space Path loss for 5 km with 2 m waves, how much power do you get when someone blasts out 750 W? My rough head calculation says you get about 20 times the capacity).</p>

Does that privilege still apply if the person semi or permanently resides in that European country either as a legal foreigner or dual citizen?</p>
","<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Not under CEPT rules.</p>

<p>First of all, it's not <strong>the</strong> CEPT agreement that USA is part of, it's one of many CEPT agreements and recommendations, namely the <a href=""http://www.erodocdb.dk/docs/doc98/official/pdf/TR6101.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CEPT T/R 61-01</a>. My advice is to always actually read the agreements and not just rely on the hear-say. </p>

<p>If you go through the agreement, you'll be able to see that the T/R 61-01 is exclusively for non-permanent residents. Don't forget that you need the ""CEPT radio amateur licence"", which is for the US interpreted as the hard-copy of your license and the FCC public notice.</p>

<p>Now, what about permanent residency? Well, that is covered by the recommendation <a href=""http://www.erodocdb.dk/docs/doc98/official/pdf/tr6102.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">T/R 61-02</a>. The way it works is that, after passing your license exam for a class equivalent to the CEPT class, you can (or could if USA were part of T/R 61-02) receive the Harmonized Amateur Radio Examination Certificate (HAREC). The licensing authority in the country you're residing in takes the HAREC as the proof that you passed the appropriate exams and issues you with the license for the national class that's equivalent to the CEPT class. Note that some countries still require proof of Morse code exam for their highest license! It's possible to have several license classes that are equivalent to the CEPT class.<br>
As I've mentioned, and can be seen in the annex 4 of the T/R 61-02, USA is not part of that agreement. </p>

<p>What can you do? Well, go outside of the requirements of the CEPT T/R 61-02 and see what you can do. First step is to understand that Europe is not a country (yet at least) and that things in European countries can work differently. It could happen that the country that you're going to be residing in will accept your US license. It could be that there's a more complicated or more expensive procedure you need to go through to get your license accepted. </p>

<p>For example, in Germany issuing the amateur radio license costs 70€. If you don't have a HAREC, then you need to go through a recognition procedure which is another 130€ on top of the issuing fee. </p>

<p>The radio itself doesn't stop me from monitoring a channel when it is in the dock, but I am wondering if it is bad practice to do so.</p>
","<p>It's perfectly safe.  Note that you will slow charging down, since you are using some of the battery's stored energy to monitor the frequency.</p>

<p>A better solution might be to get a second battery for your radio, along with a charging dock if you don't already have one.  With many modern hand-held radios, charging docks increase the charging rate compared to using the charger alone (they must include better charging electronics to permit this).  You can put a naked battery into most such chargers, letting you use your other battery on your handheld without being tethered to the charger.  As a bonus, having two fully-charged batteries will allow you to go into the field with significantly more runtime capacity with your radio.</p>

"Are the voltage ratings on Vacuum Variable Capacitors RMS or Peak","88","","<p>I'm building a magnetic loop antenna and was wondering if the voltage ratings on the vaccuum variable capacitors I have are:</p>

<ul>
<li>RMS</li>
<li>Peak to Peak</li>
<li>Peak </li>
<li>other?</li>
</ul>

<p>I have been looking at this wonderful <a href=""http://www.66pacific.com/calculators/small_tx_loop_calc.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">magnetic loop calculator</a> to help choose a capacitor and it gives the required cap voltage in RMS.</p>
","<p>You raise an interesting point; intuitively, what I'd have thought is that the peak voltage matters – because discharge through the dielectric doesn't happen for any reason but an electrical field strength (at least for vacuum as dielectric, which can have no electric polarization of any kind, being not a material) above the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectric_strength"" rel=""nofollow"">Schwinger limit</a> which you will never reach even remotely.</p>

<p>Now, necessarily, your cap doesn't hang in <em>perfect</em> vaccuum, but let's assume it  happens in a quality of vacuum (gas pressure) that guarantees a breakdown value at least equivalent to that of air (see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paschen%27s_law"" rel=""nofollow"">Paschen's Law</a>), but with negligible polarization losses; then you'd still have around 2.5 MV/m breakdown voltage (probably more).</p>

<p>Notice how I precluded polarization effects – this is my guess why these caps use vacuum instead of just being filled with some inert gas: Without any material to be subject to changing electrical field strength, you can't have molecules/atoms align their electric momentum with the field, which can, when quickly enough changing that field, reduce the breakdown voltage of a capacitor, and lead to energy losses and thus, heating of the dielectric.</p>

<p>For considerations of how much energy will get lost in a material, the RMS voltage is a good measure – same goes for the breakdown voltage reduction. </p>

<p>However, as a vacuum cap sees neither of these effects under ""earthly"" conditions, RMS is not what you need to know – you really just want to know how much voltage you might <em>ever</em> see, because, as soon as that voltage crosses breakdown voltage, there will be an arc within your cap – and that might become a self-sustaining arc, considering that its heat will possibly vaporize and splutter some of the conductor plates into the vacuum, making it a box of conductive plasma.</p>

"Can two diodes be parallelled in RB to get double the capacitance?","88","","<p>It's a fact of life that <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_capacitor#Mechanically_controlled"" rel=""nofollow"">air-gang capacitors</a>, are increasingly more difficult to come by - having been superseded by the far more compact <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varicap"" rel=""nofollow"">varactor</a> diodes. </p>

<p>My part of the world components such as the venerable <a href=""http://pdf.datasheetcatalog.com/datasheet/philips/BB212.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">BB212</a>, MPN3700, MV1662 are almost unheard of at the local stores; anyway I'm only getting started at attempting home-brew.

<p>Would I see the same behavior if several make-shift varicaps (say, 1N4007) were connected in parallel? i.e. does capacitance add up using varicaps in a tank that it does for any other capacitor?</p>
","<p>The short answer is yes, they do add in parallel.  But remember, the Cmin is doubled as well as the Cmax, so the tuning ratio hasn't changed.  Depending on what you are using them for, this may or may not matter. Of course you can offset this with an inductor.</p>

"Capacitance methods (antenna extensions, whole body as antenna) for receiving better","88","","<p>I have seen that there are times where reception isn't very good on a radio, but as soon as the hand is approached as much as possible to the antenna (with or without direct contact to the actual antenna), the signal improves a lot, as if the body worked as an antenna.</p>

<p>I have been told that a piece of metal or tin foil could be used in the same way.</p>

<p>Are there other methods (for instance using some liquid to try and improve even more, maybe better than just water for this) that anybody knows of to improve reception in this way?</p>
","<p>The ways your body, or a piece of metal, or any thing else with magnetic or electrical properties different from air can interact with an antenna are complex and numerous. Let's take your example, you moved your hand around an antenna, and the reception got better. Why could this be?</p>

<p>Your body is reasonably conductive, especially to high-frequency current. By placing anything conductive near the antenna, it becomes part of the antenna through mutual inductance and capacitance.</p>

<p>The new antenna (the antenna proper + your body) has different characteristics which may be better or worse than the antenna proper alone. It will likely have a different radiation pattern than before, which may be more sensitive in the direction of the signal, or less sensitive in the direction of noise. Either will improve the signal-to-noise ratio, which is the limiting factor in most wireless communications.</p>

<p>Your body can also absorb, reflect, and refract radio waves. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipath_interference"" rel=""nofollow"">Multipath interference</a> can be a problem for wireless communications. By putting your body in the path somewhere, you may eliminate one mode of propagation which was interfering destructively. Or, you may enable a mode which will interfere constructively. Thus, you make the signal better or worse.</p>

<p>Small devices tend to have smaller than optimally sized antennas. Your body, some part of it, or something else might be a more efficient antenna than the device's antenna, and by coupling to it (again, through mutual capacitance and inductance) you might make a more efficient antenna overall. Of course it's just as possible that you make a less efficient antenna.</p>

<p>If you want to <em>predict</em> what body positions or materials might improve the signal, that's hard. You could solve <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations"" rel=""nofollow"">Maxwell's equations</a>, taking into account the electrical properties and geometry of everything between and near the transmitting and receiving devices. Of course, that's absurdly hard.</p>

<p>The reason it's so easy to improve reception by waving your hand on or near an antenna is that you can very quickly try <em>a lot</em> (you might say <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes"" rel=""nofollow"">infinitely many</a>) possibilities, and if you can get some immediate feedback on what's working (by listening to the signal, for example), your brain quite naturally finds the optimal configuration.</p>

<p>As for what materials besides your body might work, just about anything conductive will do something. Your body works well because it's quite large and easy to control accurately. Waving something conductive around your antenna, you can probably find a configuration that works better in a particular position, receiving a particular station, at a particular time.</p>

<p>If you want to find some material or technique that consistently or universally improves reception, that's called antenna design. For example, a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yagi-Uda_antenna"" rel=""nofollow"">Yagi-Uda antenna</a> has some pieces of metal of a particular size in a particular geometry which consistently make the antenna directional, being less sensitive in some directions and more sensitive in others. If you point it at the station you want to receive, it works better than a non-directional antenna almost always.</p>

"Does a paint-can dummy load have high voltage on the metal can?

I've already assembled a functional dummy load, but have avoided using it at full power because it's currently resistors attached to copper plates in open air.</p>

<p>I'd like to move the entire thing in to a paint can (as in the link), but have a concern. It appears to me that the can itself becomes connected to one side of the dummy load. Couldn't this allow high voltage (relative to the radio) to appear on the can itself? Is there some insulating factor I'm missing? Would another material (such as a plastic project box) be a better choice?</p>
","<p>Assuming you are using <strong>coaxial</strong> cable and connectors, the case of the dummy load is contiguous with the shield of the cable and the usually-metal case of your radio. So touching the dummy load is not any more dangerous (i.e. not at all if everything is working normally) than touching your radio. The shields everywhere in the system remain at the same potential as your power supply ground, and the RF voltage appears only inside the coax and across the load resistor (which is isolated inside the can, of course).</p>

<p>If you were to feed a canned dummy load of the same construction with <strong>balanced</strong> feed line (window line, ladder line, etc.) then connecting one side of the line to the metal can <em>would</em> cause the can to be energized. I think — I'm not entirely certain I'm thinking about it properly — this would also cause the antenna system to radiate, because it is no longer completely balanced. In this case, you would still want a metal can for shielding (because the interior wiring is not a properly designed transmission line), but <strong>both</strong> conductors of the feed line would be insulated from the can.</p>

<p>What am I getting for the increased cost of the name brand?</p>
","<p>You're getting a better warranty and the ability to send it for repair if you have issues.

The programming software is often better for established brands (although there's third party software for the Wouxun portables that isn't half bad). You probably get a better front end, meaning better sensitivity especially in RF noisy areas, as well as cleaner filters, meaning cleaner transmit and receive signals.</p>

<p>I've used a Wouxun and a Yaesu side by side. I'm always afraid I'll break the Yaesu because it costs that much more. They're both pretty sturdy. The Wouxun menu is limited (six character display vs Yaesu's full LCD screen), the Yaesu has more features including wide band receive and 220MHz coverage. The Yaesu is much more comfortable to field program once you get the hang of it, whereas the Wouxun can't even have its scan list programmed in the field.</p>

"How to generate FM narrowband using varactors","87","","<p>I don't really understand how FM narrow band is created, and at the same time I can't figure out how using this simple circuit of varactors (varicap diodes) we narrow the bandwidth.</p>

","<p>Narrowband <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_modulation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FM</a> transmissions have a bandwidth that is about the same as the bandwidth of the modulating signal (the so-called <em>modulation index</em> is lower than 1). Wideband FM transmissions exceed the bandwidth of the signal (broadcast FM is 150kHz wide).</p>

<p>To narrow the modulation bandwidth for this circuit, you might reduce the influence of the varactor on the total capacitance of the resonant circuit.</p>

<p>You could:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add a capacitor in series between the varactors and C1</li>
<li>Increase the varactor bias voltage (increasing the width of the depletion region, lowering the change of capacitance with voltage).</li>

","<p>1% here is just an overly precise way of saying ""really small compared to the wavelength"".

","<p>The two are separate figures, so one does not imply the other. A good match doesn't imply no common mode currents, and no common-mode current does not imply a good match.</p>

<p>They are somewhat connected - a change to the common mode currents will probably change the impedance match. But the other way doesn't have to apply - imagine soldering a small capacitor across the feedpoint. No change to common-mode currents, but the impedance match changes.</p>

<p>So these are both important considerations in an antenna design, but they are addressed separately, and with different techniques. Common mode currents are tackled by keeping things symmetrical, the addition of a choke or balun, or changing the antenna shape entirely.

<p>If the caps seem OK, the antenna could have also just been detuned by thermal cycles, mishandling, or possibly from the factory.

Thus, I can get 2FSK out of it. I can do the same thing with another digital input and two programmed phases for PSK. The output power is 20 mW, so I'll need to hook it up to a power amplifier.</p>

<p>I've never heard of anyone building a digital transmitter this way. Usually an intermediate stage is involved. Is there something I'm missing?</p>
","<p>Your question is directly answered on page 23:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the areas where the AD9834 is suitable is in modulation
  applications. The part can be used to perform simple modulation
  such as FSK. More complex modulation schemes such as GMSK
  and QPSK can also be implemented using the AD9834.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's no need for an LO and a mixer if the AD9834 can generate a sufficiently high frequency on its own. Many HF SDRs have a similar architecture, with a high-speed DAC directly generating the RF. You may need some filtering before amplification.</p>

"Portable radio antenna measurement","86","","<p>Just purchased a HP 8711A and have ""upgraded"" the bootrom to enable vector measurements. I am now trying to learn more about how to make better measurements and understand what's going on.<br>
One of the things I wanted to try is to measure the return loss of some portable antennas (for use on portable radios).</p>

<p>The radio and user are necessary parts as some kind of counterpoise for these antennas, which makes measurements rather difficult.  </p>

<p>Can I:<br>
- Take a metal plate<br>
- Mount a flange mount connector on it<br>
- Make sure the  the plate is connected to the braid<br>
- Mount the antenna on this contraption<br>
- Use this as a substitution for the body + radio ?</p>

<p>Any other thoughts? Pitfalls I should keep in mind?</p>
","<p>You should also <strong>put an unun/choke on the feed line</strong> at the back side of your plate to ensure that only the plate and not the plate+coax+analyzer are involved. Once you've done that, I see no reason why your proposed measurement strategy wouldn't work to give you a repeatable number.</p>

<p>Of course, that number won't exactly reflect the antenna's behavior in actual operation, because even if your metal plate happens to match one particular HT+arm+body configuration it won't match others. You could have several different fixtures to model different situations, but even then you have the problem of validating your model.</p>

<p>The only way I can see to do that validation is to measure the reflected power in the real configuration — i.e. either a handheld radio with a suitable meter built-in, a physically compact meter inserted in-line at the antenna port, or an analyzer in a handheld form factor.</p>

<p>If you don't have this reference, then you can still make repeatable measurements, but you don't know what measured values correspond to the <em>best</em> real-world performance.</p>

<hr>

<p>For what it's worth, some rough measurements about the size of the variation:</p>

<p>I have a handheld antenna analyzer which can read R, X, SWR, and return loss. The primary way in which it is different from a handheld radio is a very different case design (large and plastic rather than small and coated metal), which affects the amount of coupling to the hand.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I attached a 1/4 wave whip (no additional ground plane) and measured return loss values between 3 and 6 dB at 146 MHz depending on how I held the unit.</p></li>
<li><p>A more “rubber duck” style antenna (about half length) varied between 10 and 35 dB and was much more obviously sensitive to exact positioning.</p></li>

"What are the consequences of poor station grounding?","86","","<p>What can happen if I don't properly ground my equipment?</p>
","<p>There are several ""ground"" issues for a station. Lightning ground from your antenna(e), and antenna ground plane are two on the outdoors. I assume your question is about the grounding within the shack.</p>

<p>Safety - a power ground will protect the operator from electrical (high voltage) malfunctions. Simply put, a ground to the ""third pin"" on the outlet or a convenient cold water pipe could save one from a nasty electrical shock if something malfunctions catastrophically.</p>

<p>RFI - this one is a little more complex. Depending on your feedline, antenna and outside grounding; you may get RF riding back into the shack. A good RF ground can prevent many of the RF interference and RF burns issues within the shack. What makes a good RF ground? You could ask ten operators and get a different answer from each. Some believe the electrical ground will suffice. Some believe a separate ground to an outside grounding rod is necessary. Yet others believe multiple ground paths are required. And there are some that do NOT use any ground as they believe it simply provides RF and lightning a path through the shack. </p>

<p>Regardless of the myriad of opinions, a ""ground"" of any kind within the shack is always a good safety measure to protect against power supply failures or other high voltage accidents, at the very least.</p>

"Why don't baluns require precise conductor spacing as in twin-lead?","86","","<p>This is a follow up to another recent question of mine: <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/questions/6983/does-a-balun-need-to-be-made-with-coax"">Does a balun need to be made with coax?</a> In that question, we establish that a choke balun doesn't actually work by protecting the ""third conductor"" on the outside of the coax shield, so there's no need for the coax itself to be part of the balun.</p>

<p>The design in question was the sort pictured below, where a pair of regular wires are wrapped around a toroid core. I've seen this kind of design in many places, including in other balun questions on this site, so the idea must be sound.</p>

<p>Given that there is no sort of precise spacing between the two wires, there must not be any sort of precise characteristic impedance, either. The question is, why doesn't this cause problems? Or does it, and you're expected to be using an antenna tuner to compensate?</p>

","<p>It more or less doesn't matter because it's so small, relative to wavelength. As such, a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumped_element_model"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">lumped element model</a> is valid.</p>

<p>You can make a conjecture to that effect by looking inside your antenna tuner (or really, a lot of HF equipment). Unless it's a fancy kind, there will be wires running whatever way between the components, with no attention paid to the characteristic impedance of those connections.</p>

<p>Think about it this way: imagine a change in voltage propagating down the line. When it encounters the balun, it will encounter some mismatched impedance, and some amount of the energy is reflected back. A very short time later (due to the very small size, relative to the balun) the same change, but reversed, which will send another reflection except opposite in phase back down the line.</p>

<p>If these two reflected waves occurred at exactly the same time, they would entirely cancel. In practice they aren't <em>exactly</em> at the same time, but since the change in phase between the two is so small (remember, tiny relative to wavelength), they <em>almost completely</em> cancel, and the effect is negligible.</p>

<p>The spacing of the wires does matter in a different way: there's some capacitance between them. We can incorporate that into the lumped model like this:</p>



<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gIfYu.png"" alt=""schematic""></p>

<p>The inductor and the capacitor each have some <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_impedance"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">impedance</a>, with the inductor's impedance increasing with frequency, and the capacitor's inductance decreasing with frequency. The two form a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LC_circuit#Parallel_LC_circuit"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">parallel LC circuit</a>, and at the frequency where the impedances are equal, the impedance of the balun as a whole is at a maximum.</p>

<p>It's easy to add more turns to a balun, so achieving a sufficiently high inductance isn't too hard. But each turn also increases the area where the wires are close together, introducing additional capacitance. At some point there's so much capacitance that the associated impedance is so low it effectively makes the balun a short, making it ineffective as a balun.</p>

"Why should I practice one month before a contest, rather than the week before?","86","","<p>I've seen suggestions that it's better to practice a month prior to a contest, rather than at any other time prior to the contest.</p>

<p>What is special about a that time frame that it would be suggested so often?</p>
","<p>Sunspots significantly alter propagation characteristics, and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_rotation"" rel=""nofollow"">the sun revolves at a 26 to 38 day rate</a>.  Since it's gaseous, it revolves differentially - faster at the equator and more slowly at the poles.</p>

<p>While individual sunspots can last from days to weeks, sunspot activity on a position on the sun changes slowly over time.  While you can practice at any time prior to the contest the sunspot activity will be most similar about 28 days prior to the contest, and thus propagation conditions will be most similar.</p>

<p>28 days works well because <a href=""http://www.suntrek.org/solar-surface-below/sunspots/where-sunspots-appear.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">sunspots most frequently appear just north and south of the equator</a>, in the bands with the most turbulence, and it fits pretty well with the 7 day week we humans tend to follow.</p>

"How can we determine what repeaters to use?","85","","<p>My wife and I studying to receive our Technician class license. We are thinking about how we could communicate with each other while both of use are at work, she being in Oakland, CA and myself in Pleasant Hill, CA. with several hills and about 15 to 25 miles between us. We are aware that our soon-to-be license type will limit our frequencies and power output. We also have not determined what handheld radios we'll be purchasing and are not looking for recommendations other than best frequency range and wattage output to use for this particular scenario, and if it would be possible to communicate with this distance and geographical features, even for just a few minutes during any part of the year.</p>
","<p>It sounds like you've gotten the characteristics of HF and VHF+ operating mixed up a bit. If you're going to use VHF/UHF repeaters to communicate, then your ""frequencies and power"" (and time of day) are almost always irrelevant and you either can communicate or not, with some variation due to weather.</p>

<p>There are two basic cases for repeater-based communication:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Both of you have a line-of-sight to the same repeater, and are close enough to it. In this case, with your radios appropriately set for that repeater (frequency, split, CTCSS tone), you can simply talk pretty much like simplex.</p></li>
<li><p>You each have a line-of-sight to <em>different</em> repeaters. In this case, you need to find two repeaters which have compatible <em>linking</em> systems (either part of a specific permanently-linked network, or having a controllable linking system like EchoLink or IRLP). Then you can contact one repeater, and in if needed instruct it to link to another repeater, at which point it's like the two repeaters are now one repeater (everyone hears everyone else).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Permanently linked repeaters can be treated just like a single repeater with a larger coverage area.</p></li>
<li><p>In the case of temporarily linked repeaters, however, you're now occupying two repeaters with your conversation — it's less convenient to share it with others than in the first case, since you can't just stop talking but need to also end the link. There's nothing wrong with doing this if the other repeater users don't mind, though.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>In either case, you don't choose a frequency, you use the repeater's frequency. Your transmit power will affect how far you can be from the repeater, but an even better approach is to use a directional antenna pointed at the repeater, as this improves both transmission and reception. Of course, directional antennas are bulky and you may not wish to set one up just for this purpose.</p>

<p>For <strong>you in particular</strong>, I took a look at RepeaterBook, a user-updated database of repeaters, and found what looks like a good candidate for a single repeater usable by both of you: <a href=""https://www.repeaterbook.com/repeaters/details.php?state_id=06&amp;ID=165"" rel=""nofollow"">WA6HAM</a> which is on a mountain directly between Pleasant Hill and Oakland, CA. There's an intervening hill on the Pleasant Hill side, and the database doesn't say how tall the repeater's tower is, so I can't say for sure whether it'll actually work, but it's worth a try.</p>

<p>Neither purely me, nor purely the computer, but a combination of both.</p>

<p>Is there anything like this available?  </p>

<p>Or is there any other recommended method to achieve this goal?</p>
","<p>(Shameless plug:) I have an app called Morse Decoder in Apple's iOS App store that a few customers have told me helped them learn QRQ (high speed copy).  </p>

"Testing Radios Back-to-Back without Going Over-the-Air","85","","<p>Is there a device, something like a dummy load, that will allow one to test two radio's back-to-back without going over the air?</p>
","<p>If you use a dummy load on the transmitter, it is likely that there will be enough power and enough leakage from either the load or the transmitter itself to be easily received. This is quite likely for the power levels and shielding quality in amateur equipment (homebrew or commercial).</p>

<p>If you had a non-leaky or very low-power transmitter (e.g. the various SDR transceivers recently popular), so that you actually do need to make a connection, then what you need is an <strong>attenuator</strong>. This is essentially a “pass-through dummy load”: it has two ports and an internal resistance, all properly impedance matched, so you just connect it between the transmitter and the receiver, and the majority of the power goes into the resistance.</p>

<p>An attenuator used for this purpose must have the following specifications:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Enough attenuation (loss) so that the power output of the transmitter is reduced to the safe input level of the receiver, but not so much that the signal is below the noise floor of the receiver.</p></li>
<li><p>Like a dummy load, it must be able to dissipate the full power output of the transmitter (the fraction going to the receiver is insignificant).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Attenuators can have either fixed or variable (manually or electrically) attenuation. Variable attenuation is very useful for testing but can be very expensive since they are fairly obscure test gear. <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/questions/2144/would-a-switched-rf-attenuator-be-asymmetric"">I found one for cheap at a flea market</a> that I am informed probably used to be a component of a larger unit, but absent such luck I would suggest purchasing a fixed one of the appropriate value.</p>

<li>I see that there is a pattern that repeats every 32bits in the payload. Any guess about the protocol? Is it legal to tx with a proprietary protocol on HAM frequencies?</li>
</ul>
","<p>Let's see if I can answer your question:</p>

<p>Shift:<br>
 The usual theory says that we need spacing between frequencies that is at least equal to symbol rate (or 1/2 of symbol rate for coherent detection). This automatically eliminates the 170 Hz spacing we have in some RTTY implementations. This tells us why not 170 Hz, but it doesn't say why 9 kHz. In my opinion, this would be useful shift that could deal nicely with bad carrier. Basically, the actual middle frequency of the BFSK system might not be exactly the one that has been assigned to the system and could easily have some offsets and is likely to drift with time and temperature. At 460 MHz, 1 ppm of drift would be 460 Hz, the entire spacing of a short-wave RTTY system. By using 9 kHz, we have more room for transmitter imperfections. I also believe that it could be very possible that whoever is running the system needs to get at least a 12.5 kHz channel for it. If that's the case, then there's no reason why to be saving up all that spectrum, when you don't have to.</p>

<p>Baud rate:<br>
Well it does look very unusual, but I'd say that the intended rate is perhaps 512 Bd instead of 510 Bd. This would then be very close a usual symbol rate. Since you asked about protocol, I think this is probably <a href=""http://www.sigidwiki.com/wiki/POCSAG"">POCSAG</a> used for pagers. I'm in Germany right now and the town that I'm in has 3 paging frequencies around 466 MHz. They run BFSK with 9 kHz spacing and 512 Bd is a POCSAG baud rate. There's a POCSAG decoder called <a href=""http://www.discriminator.nl/pdw/index-en.html"">PDW</a> that you can play around with, to see if it's really POCSAG or not.</p>

<p>CSMA:<br>
I don't really think this is CSMA. I mean, we're trying to sense if there's a carrier or not and we won't do that by transmitting directly. To me, this more looks like a synchronization step for the receiver. You measured the symbol rate of 510 Bd. It's relatively easy to add a pre-amble that will synchronize the transmitter's and receiver's symbol clocks together, so that when the actual data transfer starts, the receiver knows the real symbol rate and knows when a new symbol starts. Furthermore, by having a pre-amble, you can train the adaptive filters used in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equalization_(communications)"">receiver equalizer</a> to the particular channel that we have. This way, receiver can try to compensate for environment effects. This is commonly used in digital wireless technologies today. </p>

<p>32 bits:<br>
I'm not really an expert in POCSAG, so I don't know why they have those 32 bits. I think that they can be used as a sort of rudimentary error correction, they can be used to separate parts of message and give knows ending points for say <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbi_decoder"">Viterbi decoder</a> and also to update equalizer channel estimation. Finally, I'm pretty sure that 460 MHz is outside of amateur radio bands in Switzerland. <a href=""http://www.ezv.admin.ch/zollinfo_privat/04414/04853/index.html?lang=en&amp;download=NHzLpZeg7t,lnp6I0NTU042l2Z6ln1ad1IZn4Z2qZpnO2Yuq2Z6gpJCDfH93gWym162epYbg2c_JjKbNoKSn6A--"">Here</a>'s a nice illustrated guide to licensing basics from their government website which says that the 70 cm band is 430 MHz to 440 MHz, like in many parts of the Europe, so 460 MHz would be a commercial part of the band.<br>
To answer your question more directly, I'm not really sure if proprietary protocols are allowed or not in CH and this is an ongoing debate in ham radio community as a whole, since there are certain interests that are pushing for mutually not-very-open digital voice standards right now. In general case, encryption is banned, but proprietary, or not very known, standards aren't automatically considered encryption. Do note that in some countries POCSAG is explicitly allowed in ham radio. For example, <a href=""http://www.darc.de/fileadmin/filemounts/referate/vus/bandplaene/UHF_Bandplan_70_cm_Mai_2016.pdf"">Germany</a> has reserved frequencies for POCSAG in 70 cm amateur band. It's at 439.9875 MHz, if I remember correctly.</p>

"Can a vertical antenna be used for NVIS?","84","","<p>I know that verticals are normally chosen for their low angles of radiation without obscene heights, but I'm not especially interested in DX and am primarily looking for local coverage via NVIS. I've not had great luck with dipoles at my home (parallel 5kV power lines under a wavelength away for 20m and below, I think, are the reason here). I was reading an old question and saw <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/a/6302/6295"">an answer</a> that talked about using a vertical for NVIS, which I've never heard of.</p>

<p>Knowing that 1/4λ verticals are known in VHF/UHF applications to have nearly isotropic patterns, I'm not sure how to reconcile that with the ""verticals are great for DX"" thing for HF. What gives and how can I do 160/80/40m NVIS with a vertical?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Knowing that 1/4λ verticals are known in VHF/UHF applications to have nearly isotropic patterns</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not a valid assertion. A UHF/VHF vertical antenna has > 0 dBi gain (more succinctly a directivity >1) so by definition it cannot have nearly an isotropic pattern. Its primary directivity is toward the horizon at about a 22 degree elevation (although highly dependent on the the ground plane and the elevation of the antenna).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'm not sure how to reconcile that with the ""verticals are great for DX"" thing for HF</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You cannot reconcile it because the two conditions are not both true. A well constructed vertical antenna will have its primary gain toward the horizon which is what gives it its desired DX characteristics. A 1/2 wave dipole antenna needs to be mounted about 1/2 wavelength above ground to achieve a similar effect.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What gives and how can I do 160/80/40m NVIS with a vertical?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>NVIS with a vertical antenna is not a practical application as @mikewaters points out. The general concept for NVIS is to erect an antenna that directs most of its energy ""straight up"" so that the atmospheric reflections come back to earth in close proximity to your station. The vertical antenna actually has a hole (negative gain) in its pattern in the vertical direction.</p>

<blockquote>

"Choose the right dongle for NOAA images visualization with GnuRadio","84","","<p>I'm a newbie in such domain and I was reading some articles around the internet and what attracted me most is using the GnuRadio to see NOAA images using some cheap hardware.</p>

<p>I looked further it turned out that this cheap hardware is only for receiving and not transmitting and other hardware with Rx/Tx capabilities are expensive (<a href=""https://www.ettus.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">USRP</a> or <a href=""https://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">HackRF One</a>).</p>

<p>So, I am aiming to visualize some images from NOAA using the <strong>GnuRadio</strong> but I'm confused about which dongle to buy ( Preferably with Rx/Tx capabilities). and For Rx only I found a couple of options on Amazon, so which one is more suitable for such kind of applications (Provide a link if possible). </p>
","<p>Picking up NOAA imagery is mostly a feat of constructing a good antenna than having a high bandwidth, or great clock. Thus, for reception only, build a nice helical antenna, and any cheap RTL Dongle, as long as it works at 1.698 GHz – if you don't want to waste the signal quality you've earned through the antenna, a cheap LNA (Lna4all seems to be nice) will help. That'll cost you very little.</p>

<p>Regarding working at 1.698 GHz: The Osmocom RTL-SDR <a href=""http://osmocom.org/projects/sdr/wiki/rtl-sdr"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wiki page</a> has a list of RTL dongle integrated tuners and the frequencies they reach. If in doupt, the <a href=""http://www.rtl-sdr.com/buy-rtl-sdr-dvb-t-dongles/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">rtl-sdr.com store</a> dongle comes in a nice metal case and has the R820 tuner that works up to those frequencies</p>

<p>Now, for NOAA you need no TX; so, we can't tell any TX spec requirements from your question. All answers to your question would thus be based on guesses, and personal preferences! So, write down proper specs, and ask a new question about TX-capable SDRs. You'll want to specify:</p>

<ul>
<li>The range of center frequencies you want to cover</li>
<li>The instantaneous bandwidth you'd like</li>
<li>Ideally, a Noise Figure requirement; but that's hard for a beginner to guess, so instead, 

<ul>
<li>Describe what you want to <em>do</em> with that SDR, in more detail than ""transmit"":</li>
<li>Transmit and Receive what kind of signals</li>
<li>How weak are these signals, or from how far do they come, or what is your plan to do with these signals?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Point is that an SDR is really just an universal device: It lets you capture the radio signals ""as they are on the air"", and calculate the signal to be put on the air in your computer. So, an SDR doesn't serve a single purpose that we can guess from the start – you'll need to find out what you want to do, and then we'll be able to help you :)</p>

","<p>The purpose of the radials is to increase the effective ground conductivity, thus reducing losses. As you propose to have 16 radials but in four groups, I'd expect the efficiency to be somewhere between 4 radials and 16 radials evenly spaced.</p>

"Suggestions for mounting a mini-whip as high as possible","84","","<p>I've ordered two mini whip antennas from Ebay (Russia) for HF and MW.  As power lines cross my city property in a L shape - the only way to get away from them is to go up.  So I'm hoping that going 5-20 feet above my roof line will reduce the extreme RFI that is on the power lines.</p>

<p>What is the best option for mounting a mini whip high above the roof?</p>

<p>I'm considering using 10 ft emt.  Is it safe to go any higher (say 20 feet) or do I need cables or a tower to do so?</p>

<p>I want to mount two of them so I can phase them.  I'm considering using the sewer pipe (which already has a diamond discone), chimney, or gutter/side of the roof.</p>
","<p>First and foremost consider the safety aspects of your intended installation. You should ensure that if the antenna and its supports were to fall, it should not contact the power lines. The same consideration should be given for the installation process to ensure that under no circumstances should the antenna, mast, or cabling nor any equipment used for the installation be able come into accidental contact with the power lines.</p>

<p>Secondly, elevating the antenna by 10 to 20 feet may have a minimal effect on the amount of RFI received from local sources. If the noise source is in the near field of the antenna, then the results can be unpredictable. If the noise source is in the far field of the antenna, then it will basically follow the inverse square law. For example, if the far field noise source is 100 feet away when the antenna is on the ground and you now elevate the antenna by 10 feet, the noise will decrease by less than 1% - an imperceptible amount. Elevating the antenna may help with increasing the amount of desired signal, however, and this would have a positive effect on the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR).</p>

<p>The question of the mast construction depends on several factors - the yield strength of the mast, the inner and outer diameters of the mast, the height of the mast, and the wind load of the load at the top of the mast (your active antenna system). These factors can be used to calculate if the mast will bend under specified wind conditions and the amount of stress the mounting system for the mast (bending moment at the base of the mast) needs to endure to support the mast under the calculated conditions.</p>

<p>The calculations are rather laborious. I have an Excel spreadsheet that I use in an attempt to reduce the number of errors. For example, I show that with a 1 inch OD mast, 0.1 inch wall thickness, 35 kpsi yield strength, with a 1 square foot of cylindrical wind load at the 8 foot position, the maximum wind speed it can survive is 67 mph (108 km/h). This will have a total moment of > 3,620 in-pounds (> 410 nm). This is the equivalent moment of an average adult pushing as hard as they can on a pipe 1 meter from the mounting point.</p>

<p>If you are interested in the detailed formulas, post back in the comments and I will add them to this answer. Alternatively, you can find the formulas and a spreadsheet here:

<p>I can get a 300Ω dipole, and a 75Ω/300Ω balun adaptor, but all the adapters go to coax.  Can I cut a chunk of Coax, plug one end into the balun, and on the other  end stirp the insulation, plug the shield in one clip, and the conductor in the other on the receiver?  Is there a better option (DIY or commercial)?  Range is not a huge issue, I have plenty of FM options close to home.</p>
","<p>In general, impedance mismatches are not very important for receiving. Unlike a transmitter, you cannot damage a receiver with a mismatch. You miss some of the signal power that you could have gotten, but this is likely to be completely insignificant compared to e.g. the positioning and design of the antenna itself.</p>

<p>Get the 300 &Omega; specified antenna and just wire it in. It'll be fine. Or you can try using an impedance transformer as you proposed and see if it makes a difference, if you don't mind the price of the parts.</p>

<p>The best explanation I can think of for them specifying 75 &Omega; for a wire-terminal antenna input is that they used a receiver module designed for a 75 &Omega; input but didn't bother with the expense of a coaxial connector on the back. In which case, they're expecting you to just string a piece of wire from the antenna terminal, which will make a perfectly fine receiving antenna (just like one of those telescoping rod antennas) while having a fairly unpredictable impedance.</p>

  <p>802.11 signals produce very broadband signals, typically 20-22 MHz. There is evidence to date that indicates the use of a same polarized antenna with one type of feed point at one end of the link and the use of a same polarized antenna with a different type of feed point at the other end of the link, <em>may introduce a problem with HS digital signals</em>. A common example of this potential mixed-antenna issue would be if one HSMM radio station uses a horizontally polarized linear Yagi, while the other HSMM radio station at the opposite end of the link uses a horizontally polarized loop Yagi.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Can someone cite references that detail the specific evidence for these kind of problems?</li>
<li>If it's known, what are the technical reasons that HSMM transmissions through a horizontally polarized linear Yagi would introduce HSMM signal problems when they are received by a horizontally polarized loop Yagi?</li>
</ul>
","<p>At a guess, the problem is probably a timing issue with the way the antennas receive signals.  At the speed you are using here, 2.4GHz or 5GHz, small things matter. Early tests with repurposed Part 15 hardware had problems initiating a link at 34 miles as the firmware designed for WiFi house networks (&lt;100') had already given up waiting and was retrying before the ACK came back (IEEE 802.11 Experiments in Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley, QST July 2005).</p>

<p>John Champa, KBOCL (SK), did a lot of writing popularizing HSMM in CQ VHF magazine.  The heyday of this seems to have been 2003-2008.  While otherwise hard to get, scans of some of his articles are to be found at <a href=""http://hsmm.wikispaces.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hsmm.wikispaces.com</a>.  In his Spring 2004 article called ""The Frontllnee: HSMM Part 2 - Developments in Amateur Radio"", he mentions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mixed Antenna Design Problem: This is the possibility of a unique
  situation when using HSMM radio with certain antennas which requires
  more amateur radio study. It is often thought that as long as both
  antennas at the ends of an HSMM radio link are of broad-bandwidth
  design (the HSMM signal is 22 MHz wide) and of the same polarization
  (usually horizontal) then this is acceptable and all is okay. While
  this may be true for other wide signals, such as analog ATV VSB
  (vestigial sideband) signals or analog ATV-FM signals, it may not be
  true with even more broad-bandwidth high-speed digital signals. Some
  evidence seems to indicate that, for example, the use of a
  horizontally polarized dish antenna with a dipole feedpoint at one end
  ofthe link and the use of a horizontally polarized long loop Yagi at
  the other end (again both broad-bandwidth antennas and both
  horizontally polarized) may nonetheless introduce a problem (higher
  BER, or bit error rate) because of symbol errors caused by the manner
  in which each antenna manipulates the radio-signal wave front. Again,
  further radio amateur experimentation with HSMM radio signals is
  warranted to determine the impact of using mixed antenna types on the
  radio link .</p>

","<p>You say you set up your frequency shift as ± 32 kHz and that your receiver is “carrier centered” (I assume you mean at the midpoint of the two frequencies).</p>

<p>You have two options from here:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you want to get a signal like in your last diagram, you need to set your receiver LO (“carrier”) frequency so that the <em>magnitude</em> of the two FSK frequencies is different (i.e. do not be centered between them). Then you will see the ""slow and fast"" look in the output.</p>

","<p><strong>Yes, a dipole for 50 MHz is most definitely possible.</strong></p>

<p>Your 6 meter band is 52 ± 2 MHz. 2/52 is just over 0.038. This is the frequency <em>variance</em> involved: how much, in terms of a center frequency, does the frequency vary the most while remaining within the band edges. You could make this worse by cutting the antenna for one band edge and using it at another, but it doesn't get that <em>much</em> worse even then.</p>

<p>For comparison, assume 80 meters is 3.5 to 3.8 MHz. That's 3.65 ± 0.15 MHz, where 0.15/3.65 is just over 0.041. If you were to cut an antenna for 3.7 MHz (good for 80 meters SSB) and use it toward the lower end of the band, this effect becomes even more pronounced.</p>

However, 30/1270 is less than 0.024, so in terms of frequency variance, this band is actually far <em>narrower</em> than is 80 meters.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In theory yes.</p>

<p>But in practice not entirely. Real dipoles are not mounted over infinitely large, perfectly flat, perfectly conductive planes, so the nulls will not be so deep as these idealized images suggest. Furthermore, there's likely more than one path between transmitter and receiver, taking into account reflections off mountains, trees, buildings, ionospheric changes, feedline radiation, etc. In practice there are dozens of things which make the path work (or not), and many of them are constantly changing or difficult to predict. Antenna height is just one factor.</p>

"In the context of the mixer in my radio, what does balanced and unbalanced mean?","82","","<p>I'm trying to understand how the mixer in a radio actually works, at a physics level. When looking at <a href=""http://www.robkalmeijer.nl/techniek/electronica/radiotechniek/hambladen/qst/1993/12/page32/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this article</a> and studying the first schematic I realized I really don't understand what balanced and unbalanced means in that context.</p>

<p>Could you explain what the difference is between the signal on either side of the transformer so I can get a better picture of what transformation is happening as the signal passes through that component? </p>
","<p>Looking at T1, on the unbalanced side of the transformer, one leg of the input is tied to the chassis ground (the zero volt reference); the other leg is driven by a voltage source.  Because the voltages on the two legs aren't equal but opposite, the input is said to be unbalanced.</p>

<p>The current in the primary winding of the transformer creates a magnetic flux that induces an electromotive force in the secondary winding.  Because the secondary winding includes a center tap that is tied to chassis ground, the output voltage of the two legs of the secondary winding will be equal and opposite, and therefore balanced.</p>

<p>If you're still confused about the ""equal and opposite"" part, you can look at the secondary winding with a center tap as two windings in series.  Let's assume for a moment that the secondary winding is generating 10 V at this particular instant, with the top end being positive and the bottom end being negative; since we're treating the secondary winding as two windings, the top winding will generate 5 V and the bottom winding will generate 5 V.  The bottom of the top winding, also known as the center tap, will be at 0 V because it's tied to chassis ground, so the top of the top winding will be at +5 V compared to chassis ground.  The top of the bottom winding is also tied to chassis ground, 0 V, which forces the bottom of the bottom winding to be at -5 V.  The +5 V and the -5 V are equal and opposite.</p>

Why can't the program automatically calculate every factor in so it doesn't have to update it?</p>
","<p>You must update the orbital elements that your satellite tracking software uses to predict the location of satellites in order to get continued accuracy in the predictions.  Sometimes the orbital elements are not known exactly for a new or relatively unimportant satellite.  More importantly, the orbital elements can and will change over time.  Low earth orbit satellites will slow down due to friction from the remnants of atmosphere at their altitude.  All satellites will have their orbits affected by the gravitational influence of other bodies.  Although the principal gravitational effects will be from the Earth, Moon and Sun, other objects will also influence the orbit.</p>

"Does Coax Limit the Maximum SWR a Transmitter 'Sees'?","81","","<p>A recent discussion about SWR led to the assertion that a length of coax cable will ultimately limit the SWR to which the transmitter will be exposed.</p>

<p>By experimenting with an SWR calculation tool like <a href=""http://www.ac6la.com/tldetails1.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>TLDetails</em></a>, there appears to be a basis for this assertion. For example, with a 100 foot length of RG-8X coax on 15 meters, the SWR at the transmitter end never goes above 5.8:1. Even an open or shorted cable at the far end does not raise the SWR above this limit. Experimenting with different lengths and types of coax changes the limit but there always seems to be a limit of some kind.</p>

<p>What is causing this and what it the math behind it? Can this be used to 'fix' a high SWR at the antenna?</p>
","<p>The source of the SWR limit on the transmitter end is the losses in the feedline. In general, the higher the matched line loss, the lower the maximum SWR that will be present at the transmitter end. Since the SWR limit is the result of losses in the feedline, the efficacy of the 'high SWR fix' must be considered.</p>

<p>The mechanism has to do with the trips that the transmitter power must make along the length of the feedline. A simple example will help to describe the effect:</p>

<p>First consider a feedline that has a 3 dB matched loss connected to a 100 watt transmitter. We can convert dB loss to a percent loss:</p>

<p>$$\text{Percent Loss} = \frac {1} {10^{(L_{dB}/10)}}*100 \tag 1$$</p>

<p>where L<sub>dB</sub> is the loss in dB form.</p>

<p>This means that when the 3 dB matched line is terminated in its characteristic impedance, only 50% of the transmitted power (50 watts) will arrive at the antenna end of the line and be aborbed/radiated by the load. The other 50% has gone up as heat in the coax.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hyz0R.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hyz0R.jpg"" alt=""Figure 1""></a></p>

<p>Now instead of a matched load, let's consider a most extreme case of leaving the far end of the coax cable open. In this condition, 100% of the power arriving at the open end is reflected back towards the transmitter. As before, only 50% of the transmitted power (50 watts) arrives at this open connection. This is now fully reflected back toward the transmitter. But just as the forward power was attenuated, so is the reflected power by the same percent. So only 25 watts arrives back at the transmitter. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/12xbH.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/12xbH.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>We can now calculate the SWR at the transmitter:</p>

<p>$$\text{SWR}=\frac{1+\sqrt {P_r/P_f}}{1-\sqrt {P_r/P_f}} \tag 2$$</p>

<p>where P<sub>r</sub> is the reflected power, P<sub>f</sub> is the forward power.</p>

<p>The SWR at the transmitter is 3:1 in this example. Quite an amazing transformation of an infinite SWR at the far end of the feedline but it comes about as power dissipated in the coax.</p>

<p>Now let's generalize the example by creating an equation that allows us to calculate the maximum SWR at the transmitter end based on the matched line loss. Note that in the open end example, the power arriving back at the transmitter was attenuated twice. We can represent this as the square of the loss (i.e. loss times loss). Then if we use equation 2 but normalize the transmit power at 1 watt, the lower P<sub>f</sub> factor goes away. This leaves us with the following:</p>

<p>$$\text{SWR}_\text{max}=\frac {1+\sqrt{\text{Percent Loss}^2}} {1-\sqrt{\text{Percent Loss}^2}}=\frac {1+\text{Percent Loss}}{1-\text{Percent Loss}} \tag 3$$</p>

<p>If we now make a plot of formula 3, we get the following view of matched loss vs. maximum SWR:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lMJ4x.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lMJ4x.jpg"" alt=""Figure 3""></a></p>

<p>Formula 3 can be converted to a version that directly uses dB matched loss:</p>

<p>$$\text{SWR}_\text{max}=\frac {1}{\tanh \left({\frac{L_{dB}}{8.686}}\right)} \tag 4$$</p>

","<p>If you don't find a solution based on modifying the radio, this is a reasonable use for two diplexers. You can, in principle, hook them up two different ways:</p>

<p>I'm tempted to paint the PVC with non-conductive UV inhibitors, but don't know if that will de-tune the antenna. What effect does something like Krylon paint / UV resistant clear coat have on a tuned antenna that's enclosed by PVC pipe?</p>
","<p>No. </p>

<p>Even if the electromagnetic material properties of the paint were drastically different than that of air, the few microns of coating won't be even measurable. (Unless that coating really is conductive paint)</p>

<p>Another thing: You've bought an antenna. Building exact antennas is hard. If you worry about the effect of 30 µm of paint coat, then you'd also have to worry about the effect of temperature, shrinking and expanding the PVC pipe. Or the fact that no one cuts conductors for antennas with a 30 µm accuracy. </p>

<p>Why are you worrying? It's not like your antenna was exact to a high degree anyway. In fact, measurement antennas whose directivity is known to less than a percent are <em>expensive</em>. Price of a small car for antenna expensive. With a dipole variant antenna like yours, you'd be happy if the actual center frequency (ie. the point of highest matching to the nominal impedance) everything is let's say with +- 10% of what you expect. It won't work worse if a slight wind blows, but that would flex the PVC much more than a coating would add.</p>

"How to tune a hamwhip-type mobile HF antenna?","80","","<p>I'm a new ham and would like to start working HF with my mobile (my only) rig, an FT-857d. I have a handful of antennas, all of the variety that has a fiberglass base, extended by a stainless steel whip.</p>

<ul>
<li>IHF Iron Horse 75, 40</li>

<li>Antron Hamwhips 20</li>
</ul>

<p>My question is, how do I determine the correct length to set the whip extension for a given frequency? Is it a simple calculation of the total physical length of the antenna as some fraction of a wavelength? Or is the fiberglass base electrically lengthened by the wire coil evident beneath the black covering? Note: I have little other equipment besides the FT-857d; no SWR meter besides the qualitative one built in to the transceiver. While I do have an LDG YT 100 auto tuner, I don't yet have the cables necessary to connect it and I still want to set the antenna's physical length as close to optimal as possible for the SSB portion of the band.</p>
","<p>Congratulations on getting your ham license!</p>

<p>Mobile antenna installations are much less predictable than installations made for fixed locations. The mobile antenna installation is affected by the poor ground that the vehicle presents and the (typically) offset location of the antenna on the vehicle. As a result, most mobile antenna installations are compromises that require more trial and adjustment than a typical home antenna.</p>

<p>A good SWR meter or, even better, an antenna analyzer would be a good addition to your toolkit. It will receive a lot of use throughout your ham ""career"". If you cannot invest in one now, you probably could borrow one from a nearby ham or ham radio club. Sometimes an elmer (mentor) comes along free for the ride!</p>

<p>Start by adjusting your antennas per the manufacturer's instructions. This gets it into the ballpark. For most mobile antennas, you cannot directly calculate the length of the antenna as a function of wavelength because the manufacturer has added inductors or capacitors to the antenna that will throw off normal antenna calculations. Instead the manufacturer will include a chart or graph to help range in the adjustment.</p>

<p>From there you will need to use the SWR meter or antenna analyzer to adjust the antenna to the optimum setting. The advantage of using an antenna analyzer over an SWR meter is that it gives you much more information to help optimize your antenna system.</p>

<p>Once you get your antenna adjusted and you are ready to begin mobile operations, be prepared for the unexpected. Generally a mobile antenna is much less efficient than a home antenna. So at times you will be frustrated that you can hear stations that you cannot work. When I add the ""mobile"" suffix to my call, I have found that other stations are more likely to look past the more challenging conditions in order to make the QSO. On the other hand, I am often surprised to have a European station answer my mobile CQ - that's the magic of amateur radio. Enjoy!</p>

"Switching 450 Ω window line","80","","<p>I have a very old Harvey Wells Z-Match antenna tuner (transmatch) with two outputs on the back for 450 Ω window line.

<p>Currently switching the window line back and forth is a pain, since I have to break out a wrench and unscrew terminals. So I have three questions: </p>

<ul>
<li>How can I efficiently switch this back and forth?</li>
<li>Am I correct in assuming that connecting two antennas at once is a bad idea?</li>
<li>Would soldering PowerPole connectors to segments of window line create impedance problems, and are they up to the voltages and currents experienced in a piece of window line?</li>
</ul>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Would soldering Power-Pole connectors to segments of window line create impedance problems?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On HF, no. The significance of an impedance mismatch is proportional to its size in relation to wavelength. For HF the wavelength is so much more huge compared to a connector that the impact is negligible.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>are they up to the voltages and currents experienced in a piece of window line?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are using 450 ohm line, and transmitting with 100 watts, Ohm's law tells us:</p>

<p>$$ V = \sqrt{ P \cdot R } = \sqrt{ 100\:\mathrm{W} \cdot 450\:\Omega } = 212\:\mathrm V $$</p>

<p>That's an RMS voltage; the peak voltage is 1.4 times more, or about 300 volts. If you are operating the line with a high VSWR, the voltage could be higher.</p>

<p>With that in mind, read the datasheet for the particular connectors you are considering and see what their limits are.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Am i correct in assuming that connecting two antennas is a bad idea?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Usually, yes. However in some circumstances multi-band antennas are made by connecting multiple antennas to the same feedpoint, fan dipoles for example. Not recommending you try connecting two antennas, just an interesting fact.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How can I efficiently switch this back and forth?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can just use a switch. Just be sure to check its voltage and current ratings (using Ohm's law) make sure it's rated appropriately. I'd build in a very healthy margin to account for high VSWR and other things which could make voltages and currents higher than in the ideal case. And you might want to take steps to avoid touching the switch when transmitting: RF burns are painful.</p>

"Designing VLF antenna","79","","<p>I was doing some research about the relation between wavelength and antenna size and shape. I was mostly interested in 15KHz rf range.</p>

<li>Wavelength of the 15Khz frequency is around 14990 meter</li>
</ul>

<p>A simple antenna with half the wavelength of signal can send/receive this frequency but it can be altered to smaller size by using thin wire wrapped around a ferrite object. (Same method used in AM antenna design).</p>

<p>Now, let say if I use the wire gauge 26 ( with 0.4mm / 0.0159 inch diameter), how many wire turns (loops) is required for a 50mm (~ 20 inch) square shape antenna to send/receive this 15Khz signal?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>A squarish shape antenna is the best sender/receiver</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no practical basis for this assertion.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wavelength of the 15Khz [SIC] frequency is around 14990 meter [SIC]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The formula for the reasonable approximation of wavelength is</p>

<p>$$\lambda (in\space meters) = \frac{300}{Frequency\space in\space MHz} \tag 1$$</p>

<p>Since 15 kHz is 0.015 MHz, it has a wavelength of ~20,000 meters.</p>

<p>When a loop antenna is constructed with a loop circumference that is less than 1/10 wavelength, it is classified as a small loop antenna. When designing these types of antennas, one of the most important factors to which the engineer must pay attention is the <em>efficiency</em>. Small loop antennas have very low radiation resistance which gives rise to an inefficient antenna.</p>

<p>Antenna efficiency is defined as:</p>

<p>$$efficiency = \frac{R_r}{R_r+R_l} \tag 2$$</p>

<p>where R<sub>r</sub> is the radiation resistance and R<sub>l</sub> is the RF resistive losses of the antenna and any losses in the core material.</p>

<p>You can see from equation 2 that as the radiation resistance is reduced, for a given resistive loss, the efficiency drops precipitously.</p>

<p>The radiation resistance of a multi-turn loop antenna that is wound around a high permeability material, such as ferrite or iron powder, is given as:</p>

<p>$$R_r=197n^2\mu_{er}^2\left(\frac{C}{\lambda}\right)^4 \tag 3$$</p>

<p>where C is the circumference of the loops in meters, n is the number of turns of wire and $\mu_{er}$ is the effective relative permeability of the material around which the loops are wound. If the loops are air wound, simply set $\mu$<sub>er</sub> to 1.</p>

<p>You can see from equation 3 that for a given core material, as the number of turns are increased, the radiation resistance goes up according to the number of turns squared.</p>

<p>The approximate RF resistance of the loop antenna is given as:</p>

<p>$$R_l=n*C*R_{wire} \tag 4$$</p>

<p>where R<sub>wire</sub> is the RF resistance of the wire in ohms/meter. The RF resistance of 26 gauge (AWG) copper wire at 15 kHz is 1.265 ohms/meter.</p>

<p>The gain of the small loop antenna is given as:</p>

<p>$$G=1.5*n*efficiency \tag 5$$</p>

<p>Armed with these formulas, you can calculate all of the parameters for any proposed 15 kHz small loop antenna. What you will find is that very small antennas such as you suggest will be very low gain antennas due to low efficiency. Whether or not such an antenna is adequate for your application depends on many other factors such as receiver sensitivity, transmitter power, distance, etc.</p>

<p>In my design, however, |Z_load| is somewhere between 500 and 600 ohm (434 MHz differential antenna). Wouldn't it be required to pick an inductor having its impedance in the 5k - 6k ohm interval in order to actually be effective at blocking the fundamental + first few armonics ?</p>
","<p>The value is specified as ""large"". The idea is to use the inductors to provide a DC bias without affecting the RF circuit. This works because an inductor has 0 impedance at DC, but increases with frequency. With a sufficiently ""large"" inductance, by the time you get to 434 MHz the impedance will be so large that it's effectively an open circuit.</p>

<p>I wouldn't say through-hole components are ""out of the question"". The important thing is to keep the layout as compact as possible, which is easier with smaller components. Leads may add additional inductance compared to surface mount components, but frequently that's either insignificant, or can be compensated.</p>

<p>Both. And the dominant reason is, as always, cost.</p>

<p>I'll illustrate in RX first:</p>

<p>Now, radios like these work by mixing the RF signal down – in this case, usually to a fixed IF (intermediate frequency), from which the actual demodulator (AM, FM, digital...) generates the message signal (audio, data...). </p>

<p>So, for that mixer, you need a local oscillator (LO) that usually has to be
adjustable. The frequency of that oscillator needs to be $f_\text{RF}-f_\text{IF}$ – or an integer factor of that, in fact, since mixers produce more than one intermodulation product:</p>

<p>Your average mixer, fed with a tone of $f_\text{LO}$ on one input, and the antenna on the other, will convert (there's a bit of a mathematical derivation that I'm skipping here) signal from $f_\text{RF}$ to $f_\text{RF}-f_\text{LO}=f_\text{IF}$. There's nice filters around $f_\text{IF}$, so that signals a little below or above $f_\text{RF}$ don't interfere.</p>

<p>However, what it'll also do is convert $f_\text{other}= n\cdot f_\text{IF}\pm m\cdot f_\text{LO}$ to $f_\text{IF}$, for a lot of different values of $n,m\in \mathbb N$. Which means: Assuming you have IF at 27 MHz, and you use a 100 MHz LO, you want to receive 127 MHz (i.e. you convert 127 to 27 MHz, because that's your IF where your demodulator gets it).</p>

<p>Now, sadly, you also get (2·100+27) MHz, (2·100-27) MHz and other intermodulation mapped onto your IF. Because the signals at 227 and 173 MHz are not of interest (but interfere), you need frontend filters to cut them out before they even reach the mixer.</p>

<p>Analog filters are, with a high probability, the most expensive part in a professional narrowband radio. The more bands you serve, the more filters you'll need – in fact, you'll find that you'll get multiple parallel receiver chains in such devices, simply because generating a range of good LO frequencies can get daunting, and also, because impedance matching of <em>anything</em> only applies to a limited range of frequencies. </p>

<p>In TX, very much the same applies, but you might even have to be more careful, because if you forget to filter a strong unwanted intermodulation product, you're not hurting yourself, you're interfering with others. And, fun fact, if you have a frequency duplex device where the receiver might be active while the transmitter is, too, but on a different frequency, and you mess up the crosstalk suppression due to not having sufficient TX filters, you might simply fry your sensitive receiver frontend with the output of your transmit PA. In less than a couple microseconds, in fact.</p>

<p>Now, I'm coming from a SDR background, and ""30–870 MHz"" doesn't sound all that enormously much to me – we SDR folks typically trade filter quality for frequency agility during research and design, and then, as soon as we're ready to prototype things for real usage, add filters when we know where in frequency we're going to operate. So, for the simple prototyping phase, the whole LO generation, mixing and filtering chain can fit inside a single IC or on a rather compact board. Take the popular RTL-SDR dongles: They are, too, IF receivers, but their coverage is, depending on the tuner/mixer IC used, is e.g. 24–1800 MHz. And that's with a sub-$3 tuner IC! Of course, selectivity of these devices is horrible compared to a high-end commercial receiver, and the phase stability and dynamic range can be improved, but that are all cost points that the designers of these (originally TV) receivers had to avoid.</p>

<p>You can make all that a bit better – and you'd end up with devices like <a href=""https://www.ettus.com/product/details/USRP-B200mini"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">USRP B200mini</a>, which can tune their LO from 70 to 6000 MHz and allow ~56 MHz to be received at any instant – so your lowest frequency is (70-56/2) MHz = 32 MHz, your highest 6028 MHz.</p>

"How much leeway does an antenna tuner give me?","77","","<p>As far as I can tell, currently a 20m dipole has to be within a few inches to have a reasonable SWR without a tuner. How does this change with one? Does it depend on what tuner I have?</p>
","<p>Generally, the accuracy you need is directly proportional to the wave length. </p>

<p>Thus, for 20m band (==20m wavelength), let's say 3% percent of that wavelength would be in the region of ""less than half a meter error, and you're fine"". </p>

<p>But: which accuracy you'll need depends on which mismatch you can tolerate. ""A few inches"" however sounds wrong – you're not using this antenna for a single fixed frequency, where there would be a theoretical ""optimum"" length, but for the whole band, so there's a range of frequencies you'll want to work with, and for all but a single one of these, your antenna will inherently be non-optimal, but it doesn't matter, because the slight mismatch (the slightly increased SWR) doesn't really hurt you all that much.</p>

<p>Yet another warning: SWR isn't really number you're aiming for. It <strong>is</strong> a useful measure for testing how well something is matched, but in the end, if I attach a 50Ω terminator to my receiver, I get a (damn near) perfect SWR. And receive exactly (damn near) nothing.</p>

<p>Your antenna has a resistive (non-radiating) component, too, and by matching to that, you improve your SNR, but you decrease your radiation efficiency. Luckily, that component should be small for metal conductors at these frequencies.</p>

<p>What you need, in the end, is an antenna system, and that incorporates doability, the mechanical aspects of temperature and wind tolerance, the feedline, eventually baluns and stuff, and you need that antenna system to work relatively well for all that you want to do. Good SWR is just one of the aspects of that; appropriate position to actually pick up EM energy, durability and cost of the build as well as boring aspects such as it being somewhat hard to actually cut down 10m of cable to a high degree of length accuracy and spanning it in a straight-as-possible line do play a larger role, in many installations.</p>

<p>Now, to your actual question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How does this change with one (an antenna tuner)? Does it depend on what tuner I have?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. </p>

<p>Let's look at RX only, TX is analogous, just the other way around: </p>

<p>So, what an antenna tuner is, is really a matching circuit between the impedance of your antenna at the frequency you want to operate at, and the receiver you're using (typically, 50Ω). </p>

<p>Since the impedance is (at least for a dipole) always depending on the frequency, you adjust the tuner to convert exactly the impedance of your antenna at the frequency you want to 50Ω. That makes energy at that frequency come through without losses from antenna to receiver. Other frequencies are mismatched, so they inherently experience reflection at the tuner, and don't end up in your receiver. That's a filtering effect you get for free!</p>

<p>Notice that for resonant antennas, this usually means that if you consider your antenna to be an inductivity, you adjust a capacitor until the antenna-tuner LC circuit is in resonance at exactly the frequency of interest. </p>

<p>So, the amount of frequency ""variability"" a tuner gives you actually depends on the amount of reactive/capacitive loading it can provide <em>compared to the antenna</em>; also note that typically, antennas work reasonably well for frequencies that are exact integer multiples (with the integers that work depending on the antenna type) of their fundamental frequency (but they do have a different directive pattern there). </p>

<p>I do not know the specifications of my antenna nor my device that provides the 3.3V bias voltage.</p>
","<p>It's hard to say whether your active antenna would work properly if provided with 3.3 VDC instead of 5 VDC.  I doubt that any damage would be done, but I'm not the engineer that designed the antenna.  You might consider adding a boost regulator (and the other parts it requires) to your circuit, which could convert 3.3 VDC to 5 VDC.  Here's <a href=""http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Torex-Semiconductor/XC9110C501MR-G/?qs=sGAEpiMZZMsGzNf1qgY4ZMpDq1nayjCKBLbGmREn0Y0%3d"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">such a part</a>, selected more-or-less at random from the astonishing variety of boost regulators on offer.</p>

<p>Your LNA may work fine with 3.3 VDC, so you might as well just try it as-is first.  A boost regulator has an inherently-noisy switching power supply inside, which might raise the noise level at the frequencies used by the GPS satellites, as @AndrejaKo points out, so there is some risk that a boost regulator would impair your circuit.  However, the switching power supply internal to the boost regulator uses many of the external parts that the boost regulator requires; this gives the engineer an opportunity to reduce the noise level on the band of interest by tweaking the component values, if the noise proves to be a problem.</p>

<li>Why does the copper need to be a circle with a gap?</li>

</ul>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Why does there need to be a copper circle and a wire mesh to detect the waves?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The electromagnetic radio field exerts a force on the charges in the antenna, creating a very small voltage and current measured by the radio. The parts must be good conductors for the charges to be easily moved without much loss.</p>

<p>The copper circle is the basic antenna, and the mesh is a reflector, making the antenna more directional. Were it not directional it would still work, but it would be even more difficult to separate astronomical sources from terrestrial ones.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why does the copper need to be a circle with a gap?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The gap is the feedpoint, where the radio attaches to measure the charge movement in the antenna. Without a gap, how would the radio attach? There are other possible ways, but a gap works fine and is easy to build.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How would one determine the sizes of the loop and mesh required to measure radio waves with wavelengths that are tens of meters?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With antennas, all dimensions are relative to wavelength. So if you wanted to build a similar antenna for half the frequency or twice the wavelength, double the dimensions. The spacers would become 60cm long, and the loop diameter 106cm.</p>

<p>That said, 21 MHz is a wavelength of approximately 1.4 meters. All the dimensions in this antenna are significantly smaller than that, making it an <em>electrically small</em> antenna, and it may work just as well for a wide range of frequencies with no modification.</p>

"What to use to build a tower here in the Philippines?","76","","<p>I live in the middle of the Philippines. As soon as possible, financially, I want to put up the best antennas I can build. This includes, mostly, beams for all amateur bands, including, at least, antennas from 70cm to 160m, although for 80m and 160 meters a compromise such as a full sized vertical might be the best solution. It would still require a tower (preferably nonconductive) to support a full sized vertical on these bands. I would, of course, need towers to get the antennas up high enough to be more effective, especially for the lower bands. In accordance with local rules, the towers can only be a maximum of 50 meters high, due to the airport we have here. I have thought that I will probably lose little if I self-impose a limit of 40 meters +/-. Most bands require less than 40 meters for a dipole and even at 160m, a 1/4 wave vertical is only 40 meters long.</p>

<p>I also want to avoid, if possible, rotators. They are expensive and I think I can build an extra tower (or 2, or 3) cheaper than buying the rotator. I also wouldn't need wires that flex and break with age/use. I would rather have several fixed antennas that cover all directions than needing to rotate antennas. I also would consider it a benefit to just switch antennas, without a need to rotate, and virtually no delay to chose any direction, on any band, that I want</p>

<p>There are plenty of sugarcane fields that I rent, or could get access to, where I can put the antennas. There is also a mountain nearby and some these fields have significant slopes to take advantage of, so maybe the towers for most bands can be lower and still very effective.</p>

<p>The biggest question in my mind is WHAT materials I can use to make the tower, and how to preserve them in this harsh environment, all while making it as affordable as possible?</p>

<p>Special materials that need to be ordered and shipped from another country will probably be too expensive. I know that smaller cross-sections will make the load, and required strength lower, and I might get away with cheaper materials if they can be strong enough for the load required and still be small. I also know that smaller cross-sections will probably require materials with greater strength.</p>

<p>I am NOT rich and on a smaller budget, but sometimes can get a temporary increase in income (and I HOPE I can increase my usual income in the future), so it is not unreasonable to believe that if I wait patiently I will have enough money to build towers at some point. I have software to help design the towers safely. I want to use my time, which I have plenty of right now, to be prepared for this so that when the time comes I am ready and can proceed immediately.</p>

<p>Bamboo is plentiful and cheap, but harder to preserve (it is the prefered material if I can overcome the preservation doubts I now have). I also prefer bamboo so that the antennas will perform without any nearby conductive materials if possible, especially if I build fullsize verticals for 80m and 160m.</p>

<p>Steel (unless I use the more expensive and rust resistant varieties) will rust easily here and is expensive, and would need a lot of maintenance. Aluminum is also expensive here.</p>

<p>I have also thought about cement, plastic pipe (large diameter, filled with cement, etc.), pultrusions, using a mix of different kinds materials, etc. Using SOME steel would be acceptable, if it is limited (for cost reasons and also due to detuning the antennas and distorting patterns).</p>

<p>For the higher frequencies it would not need great strength due to the slopes I can take advantage of. I believe that there is little need for towers higher than about .5 to .6 wavelengths for any band except VHF/UHF.</p>

<p>What solutions (especially correct or cheaper materials and/or preservation techniques) does anyone have for this situation?</p>

<p>Sorry for the long post, but I wanted to give all the relevant information that I could.</p>
","<p>Have you thought about how you would get the signal from the towers (that seem to be placed rather at a large distance) to your shack? How will you compensate for the transmission losses? As for your idea of building strong, lasting, 40m high towers with bamboo, I'd think the only people that can advise you on that matter are around you, rather than the average radio amateur.</p>

<p>I've been in the Philippines a couple of times and seem to remember quite some construction being done with bamboo, and bamboo most often used to build temporary working constructions during building. Maybe ask the people who build these for their input? </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The repeater will need to be configured with the SSID of the target network. It must be a model which works with arbitrary networks; many will only work with access points of the same brand.

<li><p>You will need a battery with sufficient capacity to power the repeater over the time it is operating. If the repeater location is inaccessible (so that you're not turning it off when you're not using it) then this may be a serious problem. Check the specifications of the equipment for its current draw before buying, and test it before your camping trip.</p>

<p>You will also need to supply the repeater with the proper voltage. This can be done by using a battery with the proper voltage (possibly composed of several cells/batteries wired in series), or by using a DC-DC converter (power adapter). The converter adds inefficiency but also adds regulation, allowing proper operation over a much larger voltage range and therefore use more of the capacity of the battery.</p>

"How to build a balun transformer for 2m RX with low insertion loss","74","","<p>I'm looking into ways to match a 137 MHz RX dipole antenna to an unbalanced coax + amplifier. I know there are several types of baluns which can be categorized under magnetic baluns (where there are seperate primary and secondary windings) and current baluns which are essentially chokes.</p>

<p>I was hoping I could build a transformer type balun, since this would allow me to choose almost any impedance matching ratio I want. I have FT50-61 and FT50-63 toroid cores, which are advertised to work as wideband transformers from 10-200 MHz.</p>

<p>I tried winding a few 1:1 transformers for measuring purposes and the results were pretty bad, I got at least -3.5 dB insertion loss. I tried using between 2 and 8 windings of different diameters of copper and silver for both primary and secondary. </p>

<p>This is a typical response (depending on how close the windings are and how many I put on it, I can move the peak left and right by a few ten MHz only):</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/oV3pJ.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/oV3pJ.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Now I'm wondering if there is a systematic approach to getting good insertion loss, maybe by moving the peak of the curve to 137 MHz</p>

<p>Any tips are appreciated</p>
","<p>VHF transmission line baluns are very difficult to construct due to interwinding capacitance. As a result, the balun will have an undesirable self resonant point and will not typically reach the desired transformation ratio. Note that a balun does not consist of simple primary and secondary turns but rather primary and secondary transmission lines (2 parallel wires of a specific characteristic  impedance). If a balun is made simply with conventional primary and secondary windings then the core flux plays an active role. Such a design will also have a limited number of practical impedance ratios due to the requirement of a low number of turns to minimize capacitance.</p>

<p>Transformer capacitance consists of capacitance between turns, capacitance between windings, capacitance between layers, and stray capacitance. These can generally be modeled as a capacitor in parallel with each winding.</p>

<p>A better approach is to use a choking balun for common mode suppression and a lumped L, T, or Pi network to achieve the desired impedance transformation ratio. In some cases, a transmission line transformer may also be suitable for impedance transformation. In order to minimize losses, the matching network should be placed directly at the antenna feedpoint, followed by the choking balun.</p>

<p>At VHF frequencies, a choking balun consisting of #31 or #43 ferrite mix beads slipped over the outer coax jacket will be the most effective since any attempt to wind the coax through a toroid form will suffer from interwinding capacitance effects. Consider using 20 or more beads on the coax.</p>

"feasibility of wireless passive crystal earphones","73","","<p>I just learnt about such a thing as a crystal radio receiver and the following idea came to my mind. I have no background knowledge on electronics nor anything related.</p>

Not sure if AM would suffice for the 20kHz bandwidth necessary to cover the full audio spectrum but FM would be more complex for little benefit i think?</p>

<p>The antenna would be inside the string that connects the two earbuds for maybe a max of half a meter length. If two antennas (one per earphone) are needed they can both coexist in the same string but it would be thicker.</p>

<p>This would be compatible with any standard audio plug and have enough range for an apartment.</p>
","<p>A crystal radio is powered by the incoming signal.  If you've ever listened to one, you'll know that the audio is quite faint, although a purpose-built transmitter could probably be made strong enough to overcome that problem.  Traditional crystal radios receive AM only, and not in stereo.</p>

<p>It could be theoretically possible to make a receiver powered by the signal, but it wouldn't be very practical.  You would need a high-power transmitter, which would be against the law in the US and in most other countries.  There would be a tremendous amount of interference for the neighbors, and the problem would be multiplied for people in high-density housing such as a large apartment building.</p>

<p>I think I'm missing the point with multiplying by 100% — that makes no sense to me. Either way I'm not sure how doing something to 9.9 with 100% gets me 79.4%.</p>
","<p>You have entered the formula in your calculator wrong. $10^{−0.1} ≈ 0.794$, as the book indicates. If you got $9.9$, then more likely you entered $10 - 0.1$ instead.</p>

<li><p>MIMO 4G Router works with 1800 MHz LTE</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Is it a good idea to connect GSM repeater via SMA splitter to one of the antenna cables? Will the devices interfere with each other?</p>
","<p>There are different ways to “split” a coaxial connection, and some of them are wrong.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The simplest, cheapest thing you would find in SMA form factor is a <em>tee,</em> a small device with 3 SMA (or other coaxial) connectors. <strong>You should not use this</strong> because it will allow the transmission of one device into the receiver of the other, possibly damaging it with the high power. Also a tee used without care creates an impedance mismatch. Correct uses of a tee are either carefully-measured cases like matching stubs, connecting high-input-impedance test gear such as an oscilloscope, or very low-frequency applications where transmission line length is unimportant.</p></li>
<li><p>You could use a <em>power divider</em> (or combiner, it's the same thing) — this is the same type of device as used to connect multiple TVs to one cable-TV or antenna cable. This will work in principle but the devices may interfere with each other, and the incoming signal will be reduced by 3 dB.</p></li>
<li><p>The best solution in this case, where the two devices are widely separated in frequency, is known as a <strong>diplexer</strong> or <strong>duplexer</strong>. It has three ports, one which you would connect to the antenna and two more which are frequency-specific. You would choose a diplexer whose lower-frequency range includes 900 MHz and whose higher-frequency range includes 1800 MHz.</p>

<p>Because the diplexer contains filters, it will reduce interference between the two devices (if any). In fact, it <em>might</em> be even better than using separate antennas — but it depends a lot on the characteristics and quality of the devices' receivers and transmitters whether there will be a problem at all in either case.</p></li>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/cc3cg.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/cc3cg.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>
This entire setup lives indoors as I'm not able to put anything up on the roof right now.</p>

<p>My understanding of a discone antenna is that the downward diagonal elements are supposed to act as an arbitrary, floating ground plane against which the vertical elements resonate.</p>

<p>This setup works as it is but I'm getting problems with pickup on the metal case of the SDR.  If I put my hand on the metal case (anodised Aluminium enclosure well connected to the ground plane of the receiver PCB) then the noise floor on my HDSDR software jumps up massively.  What was a relatively quiet waterfall becomes a bright red mess as soon as I lay my hand on the case.  That said, I cannot hear any difference in the demodulated signal (2 Meter band, AM for instance).</p>

<p>It seems in my mind like this pickup should be prevented because of the connection to a real earth ground (via the PC's mains power supply).  There is good connductivity between the diagonal elements of the Discone and earth ground (less than 2 Ohms at DC, according to my multimeter).</p>

<p>The USB is about 2 metres long, the Coax is about 3 metres.  All connectors are soundly fastened and have good conductivity.</p>

<p>Edit: The SDR device is entirely USB powered.</p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<p>It is clear that the PC's USB connection is pulling the metal case down to ""Earth ground"".  Is this detrimental to the use of a discone antenna?  Is it bad to have a metal case on an SDR?  Is there anything I can do to improve this setup?</p>
","<p>The symptoms described are consistent with common mode currents. These are undesired currents flowing on the outside of the shield of the coax (desired currents flow on the inside of the shield and the center conductor). The result is that the exterior shield of the coax acts as part of the antenna. By touching the coax or the electrically connected SDR enclosure, your body becomes part of the antenna system altering its performance for better or worse.</p>

<p>Common mode currents can be suppressed by installing a choking balun on the coax as it exits the discone. Ferrite type baluns are usually the best but you can experiment with simply winding 6 to 8 turns of coax in a 6 to 8 inch diameter bundle. This is a compromise balun that works best over the range of a few ham bands. Experiment with the number of turns and the diameter to optimize your results.</p>

<p>These types of baluns can be effective up to 30 MHz or so. With higher frequencies, other methods must be deployed. Unfortunately, the higher frequency solutions are usually effective for a single band and its odd multiples. An example of this is to use a coax connection that is electrically an odd 1/2 wavelength long for the frequency that is being received. This tends to present a high impedance to the common mode currents. But because the length of the coax must be adjusted according to the frequency, it is only practical for a small range of frequencies. Another example of this type of frequency dependent solution is a sleeve balun.</p>

<p>One side effect of reducing common mode currents is that your antenna may not perform as well as it had. Sometimes the coax shield acting as part of the antenna is helpful to the overall antenna performance, despite the negative effects. Experimentation will determine what is best for your situation.</p>

<p>Why the lines go from that bottom copper layer up to the visible side of the board and back down? Layout! Sometimes, it's impossible to connect two things without making two lines cross. So, you build a bridge by taking one trace to the other side of the board and then back after crossing the other trace.</p>

<p>For more info, you'd have to read that IC's data sheet, and the specification of the platform – someone certainly wrote down which pins on these (hidden) connectors do what, and the PCB designer had to live with that. </p>

<p>Generally, having a ground plane next to an unbalanced RF-carrying trace is a common technique – a <em>coplanar waveguide</em>. You're right, in this case, the majority of E-Field should definitely be happening between the two balanced traces, so that's not the motivation here.</p>

"How does an SWR meter really work?","71","","<p>For ham radio operators, the SWR meter is a ubiquitous piece of equipment. There are dozens of standalone models on the market and most modern transceivers and antenna tuners have this functionality built in.</p>

<p>Any ham with an interest in antennas has probably had their hands on SWR meter. Operating them is relatively straight forward but understanding how they work seems to be another matter.</p>

<p>There is an abundance of descriptions in texts, magazines, and on the Internet that attempt to describe how an SWR meter (or its close cousin a directional watt-meter) works. Some of these even state that the meter is able to actually separate the forward and reverse power, voltage, or current. 
After looking at the schematics for many of these devices, this seems dubious. Others attempts at describing its underlying mechanisms, such as <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/questions/6240/how-should-this-swr-meters-directional-coupler-work"">How Should this SWR Meter's Directional Coupler Work</a> don't seem to come to a consensus.</p>

<p>How do these instruments really work? What is the basic math behind it?</p>
","<p><strong>Dispelling the Myth</strong></p>

<p>To begin with, the SWR meter does not have the ability to separately sample the forward and reverse power, voltage, or current. Any description of the device or its circuitry that suggests this capability is flawed. We can show this empirically with two different experiments.</p>

<p>Experiment 1</p>

<p>Connect a 100 ohm resistor directly to the output of the SWR meter (no coax cable) and directly connect the input of the SWR meter to the transmitter (no coax cable). The resistor will dissipate all the power that the transmitter can put out into the 100 ohm load - no reflections of voltage, current or power since there is no transmission line. Yet the meter will show a 2:1 SWR.</p>

<p>Experiment 2</p>

<p>Connect the transmitter directly to the input of the SWR meter. On the output of the SWR meter connect a 75 ohm coaxial cable and attach a 75 ohm load to its end. Since the load matches the Z<sub>o</sub> (characteristic impedance) of the coax cable, there are no reflections of voltage, current or power on the coax cable. Yet the meter will show an SWR of 1.5:1.</p>

<p><strong>How Does it Work?</strong></p>

<p>The SWR meter works by sampling the complex voltage and current at the point of insertion from which it calculates the effective SWR at the point of insertion on a transmission line with a characteristic impedance of 50 ohms (or whatever impedance for which the SWR meter is designed). </p>

<p>The term ""effective"" is used here because the calculation is performed regardless of whether a transmission line is present or not and regardless of the actual characteristic impedance of any transmission line that is present.</p>

<p><strong>Sampling the Voltage</strong></p>

<p>SWR meters use one of three different methods to sample the complex voltage at the point of insertion.</p>



<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ADQya.png"" alt=""schematic""></p>



<p><sup><a href=""/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fADQya.png"">simulate this circuit</a> &ndash; Schematic created using <a href=""https://www.circuitlab.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">CircuitLab</a></sup></p>

<p>In each case, the voltage sampling circuit steps down the higher voltage that is present on the transmission line at the point of insertion to a more manageable lower voltage for the SWR meter circuit. In the case of the resistive and capacitive divider circuits, the upper element is typically adjustable to allow the SWR meter to be calibrated (more about this later).</p>

<p>The voltage present on the transmission line at the point of sampling is the complex sum of all of the forward voltages plus the sum of any reflected voltages resulting from a mismatched load and source. This can be expressed as:</p>

<p>$$V_\text{line}=V_f+V_r \tag 1$$</p>

<p>where V<sub>f</sub> is the complex forward voltage and V<sub>r</sub> is the complex reflected voltage at the point of sampling.</p>

<p>The sampled voltage from any of the above circuits can then be expressed as:</p>

<p>$$V_1=(V_f+V_r)*k_1 \tag 2$$</p>

<p>where k<sub>1</sub> is the scaling constant as determined by the voltage sampling circuit design. </p>

<p><strong>Sampling the Current</strong></p>

<p>Nearly every SWR meter uses the same technique to sample the complex current that is present on the transmission line at the point of insertion. The technique involves a circuit that at first glance looks like a step-up voltage transformer with a load resistor on the secondary, but it is actually a special configuration known as a wide band current transformer.</p>

<p>A wide band current transformer converts the RF current that is passing through its primary side, to a proportional RF voltage on the secondary side. The conversion takes place by placing a load resistor (sometimes called the burden) on the secondary side. The load resistor must be much smaller than the characteristic impedance of the secondary side of the transformer for this current to voltage conversion to be proportional.</p>



<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3U3NC.png"" alt=""schematic""></p>



<p><sup><a href=""/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2f3U3NC.png"">simulate this circuit</a></sup></p>

<p>The transformer is typically a toroid device with the center conductor of the transmission line passing through the hole of the toroid to form a 1 turn primary winding with the secondary winding wrapped multiple times through the toroid form.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tP0Wq.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tP0Wq.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The complex current that is present on the transmission line at the point of sampling is the difference between the forward current and the reflected current:</p>

<p>$$I_\text{line}=I_f-I_r \tag 3$$</p>

<p>where I<sub>f</sub> is the complex forward current and I<sub>r</sub> is the complex reflected current. </p>

<p>The complex voltage resulting from the sampled current using a wide band current transformer can then be expressed as:</p>

<p>$$V_2=(I_f-I_r)*k_2 \tag 4$$</p>

<p>where k<sub>2</sub> is the transformation factor, in volts/amp, as determined by the wide band current transformer circuit design.</p>

<p><strong>Calculating SWR and Power</strong></p>

<p>We now need a way to use the sampled voltage and current to calculate the SWR as well as the forward and reflected power. Most equations for calculating these values involve knowing the forward voltage and the reflected voltage. But so far we only have V<sub>1</sub> which is proportional to the sum of these complex voltages as shown in equation 2. There is, however, another way of expressing the complex current that is present at the sampling point that can help us:</p>

<p>$$I_\text{line}=\frac{V_f-V_r}{Z_o} \tag 5$$</p>

<p>where Z<sub>o</sub> is the characteristic impedance of the transmission line, typically 50 ohms in amateur radio applications.</p>

<p>We can then substitute equation 5 into equation 4:</p>

<p>$$V_2=(V_f-V_r)*\frac{k_2}{Z_o} \tag 6$$</p>

<p>Now we subtract V<sub>2</sub> in equation 6 from V<sub>1</sub> in equation 2:</p>

<p>$$V_1-V_2=\Bigl((V_f+V_r)*k_1\Bigr)-\Bigl((V_f-V_r)*\frac{k_2}{Z_o}\Bigr) \tag 7$$</p>

<p>With a Z<sub>o</sub> of 50 ohms, if we set the k<sub>2</sub> to k<sub>1</sub> ratio to 50, equation 7 is greatly simplified:</p>

<p>$$V_1-V_2=(V_f+V_r)-(V_f-V_r)=2V_r \tag 8$$</p>

<p>Keeping the same k<sub>2</sub> to k<sub>1</sub> ratio but adding V<sub>1</sub> and V<sub>2</sub>:</p>

<p>$$V_1+V_2=(V_f+V_r)+(V_f-V_r)=2V_f \tag 9$$</p>

<p>This adding and subtracting of V<sub>1</sub> and V<sub>2</sub> had in the past been accomplished with a switch on the SWR meter. Now it is more common that V<sub>1</sub> is fed into a center tap of the secondary of the wide band current transformer. With the appropriate circuit values, one leg of the transformer is then V<sub>1</sub>+V<sub>2</sub> while the other leg is V<sub>1</sub>-V<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>Since power is proportional to voltage squared, equation 8 gives us a voltage that is proportional to reflected power while equation 9 gives us a voltage that is proportional to forward power. Each of these voltages are fed to their respective meter movement where the logarithmic scale drawn on the meter face does the conversion of the linear meter deflection, that is based on voltage, to power.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/X4rY3.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/X4rY3.jpg"" alt=""Dual Needle SWR Meter""></a></p>

<p>The conversion of forward power and reflected power to SWR is given as:</p>

<p>$$SWR=\frac{1+\sqrt{\frac{P_r}{P_f}}}{1-\sqrt{\frac{P_r}{P_f}}} \tag {10}$$</p>

<p>Or alternatively the conversion of V<sub>f</sub> and V<sub>r</sub> to SWR is given as:</p>

<p>$$SWR=\frac{1+(V_r/V_f)}{1-(V_r/V_f)} \tag {11}$$</p>

<p>The meter face pictured above shows the intersection of the two needles on the 2:1 SWR line which corresponds to equation 10 for the powers shown. The SWR meter designer simply plots a number of SWR values on the meter corresponding to the intersection of the forward and reflected powers.</p>

<p><strong>Calibrating the SWR Meter</strong></p>

<p>The typical calibration routine for the SWR meter is to attach a resistive load that is equal to the Z<sub>o</sub> of the feedline directly to the output of the meter. A transmitter outputs the appropriate amount of power to the input of the SWR meter. The voltage dividing network is then adjusted such that P<sub>r</sub> is equal to 0.</p>

<p>Since P<sub>r</sub> is proportional to (V<sub>r</sub>)<sup>2</sup>, we can see from equation 7 that this adjustment is simply ensuring that k<sub>2</sub>/k<sub>1</sub>=50 for an SWR meter that has been designed for 50 ohm feedline.</p>

<p>As shown in two pictures，setting a different bandwidth-value in the module, the value of the coordinate axis change accordingly. How did it happen? And I want to know if gnuradio can tell us the bandwidth of signal.</p>
","<p>GNU Radio, like any DSP system, works primarily in terms of <em>sample counts</em>, not <em>time</em>. Therefore, you have to add on time information — a sample rate — to get correct frequency-domain information. GNU Radio does not automatically figure out what the matching sample rates between parts of your flow graph are, so you have to set them up correctly yourself.</p>

<p>The QT GUI Frequency Sink always starts out <em>displaying</em> the entire range of frequencies in the digital signal — that is, between -1 and 1 cycles/sample, or $-π$ and $π$ radians/sample, or $-\frac{f_s}2$ to $+\frac{f_s}2$ where $f_s$ is the sample rate. But the sink does not <em>know</em> what the sample rate of your signal is, so you have to tell it that in order to get a correctly <em>labeled</em> frequency axis. That is what the (unfortunately named) “Bandwidth” parameter of the QT GUI Frequency Sink block does — it sets the scale for the frequency axis.</p>

<p>You should always set that parameter to the <em>sample rate</em> of the signal you are providing to it.</p>

<hr>

<p>In order to actually measure the bandwidth:</p>

<ol>
<li>Once you have set the sample rate properly, </li>
<li>mouse over the left and right edges of your signal, note down the Hz values that are displayed,</li>
<li>and subtract the larger from the smaller.</li>
</ol>

<p>I do not know of any GR blocks that automatically measure bandwidth, but you could certainly arrange to capture FFT data and calculate it on your own outside of GR (using whatever definition of bandwidth suits your application).</p>

"Transition Point Between Fan and Cage Dipoles","70","","<p>A fan dipole is a dipole with multiple active elements, either for different frequencies or different directions (see turnstile antenna) while a cage dipole emulates a larger conductive by having multiple spaced wires for a single band. </p>

<p>As the wires in a cage dipole get farther apart, effective bandwidth goes up... but at some point, you've created a turnstile antenna. What differentiates the two? Is there a transition gradient between them? Is it about the radiating elements being parallel for the majority of their length?</p>
","<p>A fan dipole is usually constructed of a small-ish number (3 is typical) of thin wires, each trimmed to a specific length to have three distinct resonant modes and 3 distinct frequencies. Usually they are of substantially different lengths so each resonance falls on a different band. For example a fan dipole might be designed for 20, 17, and 15 meters.</p>

<p>A cage dipole is more like a single, very fat dipole with the insides of the conductors removed. All of it is about the same length, so we can expect one resonance where the dipole is 1/2 the wavelength, and at odd multiples thereof. However the resonance is wider than that of a thin dipole, since the resonant nodes aren't confined to such a thin line.</p>

<p>There are no hard and fast rules with antenna design. There are certainly possible designs which share characteristics of each of these designs. We simply give names to established categories, much like we do with art, such as ""cubism"" and ""impressionism"".</p>

<p>A turnstile antenna is quite a different beast. It is really two dipoles, each fed with a 90 degree phase shift. Such a thing can't be obtained by simply taking a fan dipole and spreading the elements farther apart. Obtaining the phase shift requires a particular feed arrangement, such as a power splitter with a 90 degree delay line on one of the branches.</p>

<p>After a quick google search it seems like it is not possible. So if it is not possible, could someone explain to me why that is not possible?</p>
","<p>If your RC car used a Bluetooth radio to control it (I'm sure there are some out there), then obviously it <em>is</em> possible and does not require any modification, just the right app on your Bluetooth-supporting phone.</p>

<p>So I'm assuming your question is about the traditional sort of RC car with a dedicated transmitter/controller, and about the <em>general</em> reasons it <em>probably won't work</em>. There are several problems at different levels, but it all comes down to <em>the two ends are too different</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Frequency.</strong> Radio transmissions are at different frequencies both as a fundamental fact of physics (you have to pick one) and to avoid interfering with each other (pick one that someone else isn't using).</p>

<p>There are many physical/electronic factors making any radio more or less specifically built for a given range of frequencies &mdash; the antenna, local oscillator, and filters (if any) are all built for that range and will operate poorly or not at all outside of it. Some radios are designed to work across a very wide frequency range (""general coverage"" receivers, research/hobby SDRs, etc.) but as a result of this they have worse performance at any given narrower range. And for cell phones, the radio performance &mdash; whether you have usable service or not in a given location &mdash; is a key selling point.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Firmware and modulation.</strong> The radio chips in your phone are not completely general-purpose SDR radios &mdash; they are designed to ""speak"" a particular radio protocol (GSM, CDMA, Bluetooth, WiFi, etc.). The specific design allows them to be much more energy-efficient (longer battery life for your phone), but means that they (most likely) cannot be told to switch to the frequency your RC car expects to receive, or to send the format (modulation, protocol) of control signal it expects.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Software.</strong> This is the least fundamental of the issues, but still one of them. Even if your phone's radio hardware could be ""convinced"" to do what you're looking for, you would have to have some way for your application to take control of the radio hardware. Generally, a phone operating system does not have a provision for this, and if it did there would need to be a feature for it also in the driver provided by the radio chipset's maker.</p></li>
<li><p>There are also legal/regulatory issues with being able to program a radio to do something different. In most countries, devices containing radio transmitters which are sold to the general public are required to operate in specific expected ways (specific frequencies, maximum power limits, obeying various more specific rules) and be <em>unable</em> to be reconfigured readily to send arbitrary radio signals.</p></li>

For example, on the x, y, and z axis.  I want to automatically move the antenna to its optimal physical orientation, using a home-made system.  The system knows the frequency we want to turn to, so it shouldn't get confused by stronger signals on other frequencies.</p>

<p>I want to know if sequentially tuning each axis in this way will result in the most efficient orientation of the antenna.  For example, tune the 'x' axis until the signal strength is the highest on that axis, then tune subsequent axis the same way.  Each axis is only tuned once.</p>
","<p>Simple answer: Yes.</p>

<p>More complex answer: No.</p>

<p>Radio propagation is complex. In particular, a desired signal may be received by multiple paths. That means there are multiple directions in which the antenna may point and get improved reception. Some paths are better than others, so there's probably just one direction which is best, but without trying <em>all</em> the directions, you can't know for sure if you've found the absolute best direction, or just a local peak of a sub-optimal path.</p>

<p>Fortunately, it's usually pretty easy to try all the directions, and in very many situations there may not be significant paths in significantly different directions from the best one. Thus the simple answer, ""yes"".</p>

<p>There's also the additional problem that in some situations (HF, especially) the path is constantly changing. What the best path is now is different from what it will be in 30 seconds, so the best we can manage with a mechanically rotated antenna is to orient it in the direction that's pretty good most of the time.</p>

<p>Further complicating the issue is that orienting the antenna for maximum received signal power is not necessarily optimal for communication. What we are actually trying to optimize is the signal-to-noise ratio, so we also want to minimize received noise. That is, in some situations it may be more advantageous to aim a null at the noise, rather than aim a peak at the signal.</p>

<p>Very complicated answer: Yes.</p>

<p>Interestingly, for electronically phased antennas (that is, an array of antennas where each element is fed an independent signal), there exists an algorithm which can find the best (electronically selected) orientation of the antenna array if we know what the signal should be. Frequently this is achieved by periodically transmitting a synchronization signal.</p>

<p>This method is called <a href=""http://www.antenna-theory.com/arrays/weights/mmse.php"" rel=""nofollow"">minimum mean square error weighting</a>. If we know what the signal should be, then we can look at what was actually received by each antenna and calculate weights for each antenna that most closely approximate the expected signal.

<p>You could confused by word ""stationary"", for this question two things can be applicable ""smart antennas"" as stationary antennas or even any other antennas (stationary too), and under term ""adaptive"" I mean ""smart antennas"" in mobile systems (for example in military systems on wheels).</p>
","<p>Non-adaptive antennas in mobile systems are usually omnidirectional, meaning they radiate equally in all directions. They can also have directional antennas, if there is some means for getting them to point in the right direction. Usually that means the vehicle on which the antenna is mounted has to stop.</p>

<p>Adaptive arrays are directional antennas that automatically point themselves in the right direction. This could be determined by the <a href=""http://www.antenna-theory.com/arrays/weights/lms.php"" rel=""nofollow"">least mean square (LMS) algorithm</a>, for example. This algorithm works by finding the coefficients for each array element which minimize the error in some known aspect of the signal, like a sub-carrier, synchronization, or error-correction information.</p>

<p>Since the algorithm is dynamic and statistical, we can't say exactly what the radiation pattern will look like, but generally lobes will be placed in the direction of the desired signal, and nulls in the direction of noise sources.

"what is choking reactance in TLT?","66","","<p>I was studying about the Guanella 1:1 balun and came across the term ""choking reactance"". What does this mean? Why does its value need to be large? </p>
","<p>A ""Guanella balun"" is really just a common-mode choke.</p>



<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JrreI.png"" alt=""schematic""></p>



<p><sup><a href=""/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fJrreI.png"">simulate this circuit</a> &ndash; Schematic created using <a href=""https://www.circuitlab.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">CircuitLab</a></sup></p>

<p>For differential-mode currents, the current on one half of the transmission line is equal but opposite the current on the other half. Likewise, the magnetic fields due to these currents is equal but opposite, so they cancel, and so there's no magnetic field at all. Consequently differential-mode currents see no inductance at all, and pass through as if the choke isn't there at all.</p>

<p>For common-mode currents the magnetic fields don't cancel, and so the choke looks like an inductor. This is the ""choking reactance"", inductance being a specific case of reactance. Ostensibly, we have the feedline where we don't common mode currents to flow (the ""wrong"" place), and we have some other place we'd like them to flow (the ""right"" place). For example in a coax-fed dipole, the ""right"" place is the leg of the dipole attached to the shield.</p>

<p>The idea with a common-mode choke employed as a balun in this case is to make the impedance seen by the common-mode currents on the feedline significantly higher than the impedance to the ""right"" place, whatever that is. Consequently most of the current will flow in the ""right"" place, and very little in the ""wrong"" place: the feedline.</p>

<p>Here's a similar but much simpler situation at DC:</p>

<p><sup><a href=""/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fS3GMo.png"">simulate this circuit</a></sup></p>

<p>Since R1 is significantly bigger than R2, almost all of the current will flow through R2. The idea with the choke is similar, except instead of resistances we are using reactances which are analogous for AC.</p>

<p>So in order for this balun to be effective, that impedance seen by common-mode currents, the ""choking reactance"" due to the transformer, must be significantly higher than the impedance to whatever the other place is where you'd prefer those currents flow.</p>

"What kind of losses do you get from an LC network matching the antenna's impedance?","66","","<p>If you have a transmitter that is perfectly on your frequency but you have an antenna with some impedance what types of losses, and of what magnitude, will you expect from a tuner in between your transmitter and antenna?</p>

<p>For example lets say your system as a whole with no tuner has an SWR of 3 and your system with a tuner is now 1:1. Are there power losses from an LC network used to match impedances? </p>

<p>What are these losses called? Is it easy to calculate wasted power? Is it frequency dependant? Is there a way to approximate delivered power from a given capacitance and inductance on a line with a specific SWR?</p>
","<p>An ideal LC network causes no losses whatsoever, because ideal inductors and capacitors do not dissipate power — they have no resistance. The actual loss in your matching network is determined by the actual resistances of the components. It is frequency-dependent because the overall behavior of the network is, and it is also <em>power</em>-dependent due to saturation of inductors' magnetic cores (unless your inductors are air-core).</p>

<p>The other major source of loss in this type of configuration is <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/questions/7333/what-is-the-actual-loss-in-a-feed-line-with-high-swr"">the loss due to standing waves in the feed line</a> between the antenna and tuner (just as if you were not using a tuner). This is why tuners are best placed near the antenna rather than the transmitter.</p>

"Seeming conflict in the definitions of dynamic range","65","","<p>As I understand it, dynamic range is the difference in dB between the strongest and weakest signal discernible by your receiver. So, the larger the dynamic range, the better, which seems intuitive.</p>

<p>However, calculating reciprocal mixing dynamic range (RMDR - dynamic range determined by the calculation of reciprocal mixing, distance in dB where the two lines cross the noise floor) shows that the closer the slope of the third-order intercept (IP3) line is to that of the ideal line for receiver amplifier compression, the smaller the dynamic range, and you want the IP3 line slope to be as close to the ideal as possible, which seems to minimize the dynamic range, which in turn seems to conflict with the original definition for dynamic range.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4BkxL.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4BkxL.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>What am I missing, since there seems to be a conflict here?</p>
","<p>While the two terms in question share the phrase ""dynamic range"", they are in fact, quite different metrics from one another. Therefore there is no reason to assume any type of conflict or contradiction.</p>

<p>The basic receiver dynamic range is a measure of a receiver's ability to handle a wide range of signal strengths - from the very weakest (typically at the receiver's MDS - Minimum Discernible Signal) to the strongest. Several factors come into play that determine the receiver's dynamic range such as phase noise, noise figure, 2nd and 3rd order intercepts, 1 dB compression point, etc.</p>

<p>The receiver RMDR - Reciprocal Mixing Dynamic Range became significant with the application of frequency synthesizers as the LO (local oscillator) in the superhetrodyne receiver. These synthesizers tend to have phase noise on the skirts of their envelope. Under the right conditions, a signal that is otherwise out of the passband of the IF chain can mix with this undesired LO phase noise to generate interference within the IF passband and thus interfere with desired signals in the passband. Lowering the LO skirt phase noise will improve the RMDR.</p>

"Connecting radio in parallel with inverter in mobile set up","64","","<p>I've just added a leisure battery, split relay and circuit swap loom to a newly acquired Mazda Bongo. Also added was a 1000W pure sine wave inverter, hooked up directly to the leisure battery. That's in the glove box. There's room above that for the radio body, as far as I can tell.</p>

<p>Rather than feed the radio power cables back through the bulkhead, does anyone know if there are any potential problems with hooking it up in parallel to the inverter, i.e. connecting the + and - to the inverter's terminals?</p>

<p>I'm assuming it'll power just the same, only putting the inverter cables under more work if both on at the same time - TV and HF radio, perhaps, at a push. The cables are 16mm, ought to be sufficient for the ampage the inverter can theoretically pull (although I'll be running at most 600W through it intermittently).</p>

<p>Also, the leisure battery reads 13.7v-ish when the engine is on, 12.9v when off. Obviously I'd like to run it with it off. The 12.9/12.5v the battery will run at when engine off is within the +/- 15% tolerance of the Yaesu 857d being used, so that shouldn't present too much of a problem, if I'm not mistaken?</p>

<p>Further note: I'll enable the auto switch off feature I've heard the 857d has, if and when this installation happens!</p>
","<p>There are two things I like to highlight:</p>

<p>1) You are thinking of putting the radio in the same glove box as the inverter; hence you may need extra ventilation/circulation to ensure neither equipment will over heat</p>

<p>2) usually inverters have fuses build into the inverter, which means that the cables between battery and inverter are unfused (fused at the far end). The best practice for mobile radio installs is to fuse as closely to the battery as possible, you divert from this by connecting the radio directly to the inverter terminals. </p>

<p>In regards to 1) I would not put the inverter in the glove box, nor would I put the radio in the glove box. I would try to find better locations in the vehicle with more (air-)space.</p>

<p>In regards to 2) I would run seperate cables from battery to radio, fused as closed to the battery as possible. And I would fuse both positive as neurtral.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.k0bg.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">k0bg</a> runs an excellent website with information about mobile installs. I highly recommend a read.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every transceiver manufacturer, and every vehicle manufacturer, has heretofore recommended <strong>direct to battery connections</strong> (both positive and negative leads), or to so-called jumps points when the battery is indirectly mounted under a fender well, or trunk area. However, that has changed! All late model vehicles, especially those with EIS (Engine Idle Shutoff), have a battery monitoring system. Typically, these systems use a Hall device to measure battery current drain (Electronic Load Detector). However the wiring is done, it must <strong>not circumvent the ELD</strong>. A service manual is essential in these cases. As an alternative, your dealer's service manager is a good resource. In any case, both leads should be <strong>fused as close to the power source (SLI battery) as possible.</strong></p>

","<p>Perhaps the reason for the shortness is to not confuse it with actual data.

<p>It seems weird that an entire frequency would be occupied by a single tone. Is this a coded tone of some kind? It doesn't sound like it modulates at all. Maybe its for testing the tuning of your gear? </p>
","<p>A pure tone is an unmodulated signal — it carries no data. Almost nobody intentionally transmits a pure tone — it would be wasteful. The exceptions are the time-and-frequency reference signals like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWV_(radio_station)"" rel=""noreferrer"">WWV</a>, but they have modulated time information in addition to the carrier which serves as a frequency reference signal.</p>

<p>What you are receiving is almost certainly <em>unintentional</em> transmission. Any oscillator, or clock in the digital-electronics sense, usually ends up radiating some of its output through the attached circuitry. Particularly when the oscillator is inside the receiving equipment, it is known as a “spur” or “birdie”.</p>

<p>The popular RTL-SDR has a 28.8 MHz oscillator inside, so you will see a signal there if the WebSDR you were using is based on that hardware.</p>

<p>Other unintentional transmissions may be more complex than pure tones, either because they are intentionally modulated signals intended to pass through cables (e.g. USB) or because they are controlled or perturbed in some fashion (e.g. switching power supplies under varying load).</p>

  <p>(b) Provisions are incorporated to limit transmission by the station to a period of no more than 3 minutes in the event of malfunction in the control link.</p>

<p>So my question is: Why is ""my talking"" not being repeated as strongly enough to activate radio, but the post-talking burst is?</p>
","<p>You are probably experiencing what is called ""desense"". The strong signal of your transmitting radio is getting into the receiver on the receiving radio and blocking its ability to receive the repeater even though they are on different frequencies.

2017-08-25 16:30:00   -   Hiker descends mountain and leaves TH-72 on summit.
2017-08-25 19:15:44   -   First vehicle comes in range and TH-D72 digipeats an APRS position packet.
2017-08-26 05:09:17   -   Final digipeated APRS packet (all vehicles may have gone out of range at this point).
2017-08-26 06:54:40   -   Final automatic APRS beacon sent from TH-D72 (it seems to have sent beacons up to 00:30:00 apart).

","<p>Your confusion stems from the fact that your mind (and the WX GUI scope sink) uses linear interpolation between the samples. </p>

<p>Think about it like this: at exactly 16 kHz sampled with 32 kHz, you'd get 2 samples per period, right? So, if these samples happen to lie on the extrema of the cosine, you'd get $[+1\, -1\, +1\, -1\, \ldots]$.</p>

<p>With 13.7 kHz not that far away from that, you ""mostly"" get alternating signs, too, but every so and so many samples, you still ""hit"" the same upper or lower half of a cosine twice. That's why things <strong>look</strong> irregular. </p>

","<p>The issue of filtering RS-232 (or any slow digital signal) is not so much the baud rate as it is the required rise and fall time of each bit.</p>

<p>There are two ways to quantify this rise/fall time issue: what does the RS-232 standard say or what does your RS-232 chipset and UART require? I have formulated my answer from the perspective of the former.</p>

<p>RS-232 control signals should maintain a rise/fall time of less than 1 ms. When operating at 19,200 baud, data signals should maintain a rise/fall time of less than 5 <em>u</em>s. The slew rate of the rise/fall time should not exceed 30 V/<em>u</em>S to avoid crosstalk. Your filters must be designed to ensure these rise/fall timing constraints are met.</p>

<p>You did not elaborate on the type of EMI/RFI you are experiencing. Filter types commonly deployed for RS-232 signals include:</p>

<ul>
<li>RC T filters (T for infiltrate and exfiltrate protection)</li>

<li>Ferrite beads (material based on filtering requirements)</li>

"Noticable difference between trunk and roof mount?","61","","<p>Between trunk-mounting and roof-mounting a 2m/70cm antenna, both as through-hole NMO mounts, is there really that big a difference performance-wise? I mean, I know roof mounting is better, but let's face it: looks <em>are</em> a factor for some of us (and especially our significant others), and a trunk mount is much more understated than dead center of the roof. Plus, from a convenience standpoint, if you live in a city, it's nice to be able to park in a garage without removing the antenna.</p>

<p>I've seen the <a href=""http://kv5r.com/wp-content/img/ham/tig/mobileant.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">diagram</a> from Larsen's catalog, but numbers don't tell the whole story. Especially not to a new ham like me. -3dB is half the signal strength gone, or put another way, just half an S-unit. I'm more curious about practical experiences (especially from people who have tried both). Plenty of people act like you're asking for trouble if you don't roof-mount, but truthfully, would I really notice those missing 3dB, and if so, would I mind it? Or will there be other effects that I'll mind?</p>

<p>If necessary, to give the question a little more scope, this is my first mobile installation (if it wasn't obvious). The antenna is a Larsen NMO-2/70B. I drive a 2014 Camry and live in the middle of Philly (think multistory buildings), but take that with a grain of salt. If I'm getting in my car at all, I'm pretty likely going out of town.</p>
","<p>Yes there is a difference but it tends to have more to do with the pattern and efficiency of the antenna than anything else.</p>

<p>When an antenna is mounted on the trunk, the roof line and the occupants of the vehicle tend to block RF energy in the forward direction. The rearward direction is minimally affected. So in this case, depending on the direction you are driving this may or may not make a difference.</p>

<p>Placing the antenna on the roof of the car not only gives it an unobstructed view, but it also slightly increases the size of the ground plane under the antenna. This may help to increase the efficiency (and thus gain) of the antenna somewhat.</p>

<p>When communicating on VHF and UHF, the most reliable communications come when the stations are in line of sight to one another. The roof does give a couple of feet of added height to the antenna possibly improving the chance for line of sight communications.</p>

<p>The net of all of this is that it is difficult to come up with a hard and fast rule if one antenna location will allow communications when the other antenna will not but in general, the roof mounted antenna will be superior.</p>

<p>My advice is to do the best installation that satisfies your and your family's criterion for what is acceptable for your circumstances. You will communicate effectively in most practical situations.</p>

"Can I estimate range of a low power transmission based on power (in mW)?","60","","<p>I've read that radio range is influenced by a lot more than the power output of the transmitter.  From what I've seen, line of sight and interference can be much more significant factors.</p>

<p>Is that also true for really low power transmissions, or is there a way to estimate the range based on power?  I'm talking about cases like the transmitters they used to make to ""connect"" your MP3 player to your normal car radio (pre bluetooth and ""aux"" inputs), or walki talkie's in the same room?</p>
","<p>When a transmitter and receiver antenna are in line of sight with one another, we can calculate the effective loss of the path based on the distance between the transmitter and receiver antenna, the gain of those antennas, and the frequency involved:</p>

<p>$$ \text{Path Loss (dB)} = 20\log(d) + 20\log(f) +32.44 - G_{\text{TX}} - G_{\text{RX}} $$</p>

<p>where</p>

<p>$d$ = distance in km<br>
$f$ = frequency in MHz<br>
$G_{\text{TX}}$ = transmitter antenna gain in dBi<br>
$G_{\text{RX}}$ = receiver antenna gain in dBi</p>

<p>So for example, a 1 km path at 400 MHz with 0 dBi antennas on the transmitter and receiver would have a free path loss of approximately 84.5 dB.</p>

<p>We now need to know the minimum receive power level that the receiver requires to properly decode or playback the information or signal from the transmitter. Let's use an example of a moderate receiver with a minimum signal requirement of -113 dBm. This would correspond to a 0.5 uV signal into a 50 ohm input impedance.</p>

<p>Since the receiver requires at least -113 dBm and we will lose 84.5 dB just due to the path losses, the transmitter must supply at least a -28.5 dBm signal (-113 dBm - 84.5 dB) or approximately 1.4 milliwatts of power.</p>

<p>If there are objects in the path that may absorb or reflect RF power, then these effects must be added to the above analysis. An example of this based on your question would be to model the effect of a human body between the transmitter and receiver. Depending on the frequencies involved, this may have no effect at all or it may increase the path loss and therefore require a higher power transmitter, a more sensitive receiver, or better (higher gain) antennas or some combination of these.</p>

<p>I doubled checked the meter by measuring couple of ""normal"" capacitors and it measured them without any difficulties</p>
","<p>Sure, if your L/C meter is designed to work at those capacitances. The capacitance of a gamma rod isn't much -- it's probably measured in pF. The lowest range of the inexpensive L/C meter I have from eBay is 200pF, which is fine for most of the capacitors in my parts drawer, but not so great for RF.</p>

<p>Also keep in mind: if you are making connections with long alligator clips, these are going to have inductance and capacitance in addition to the gamma rod. Depending on how well the clips chomp down they may add significant resistance, too. Unless you take some very special care to keep those leads short or compensate for them, you are going to introduce so much stray reactance with the leads that any measurement you obtain won't be of much use.</p>

<p>In practice, anything designed to measure the reactances typical at RF stops being called an ""L/C meter"" and starts being called an ""antenna analyzer"" or a ""network analyzer"".

","<p>Let's wrap this up from the back:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And is there any potential separated USB cable?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. You can buy these as isolated USB interface. They make sense in applications where e.g. medical-grade isolation between user interface and device is necessary, or where the device controlled over USB is somewhere that might experience things like discharge from large motors etc.</p>

<p>A CAT (computer-aided tuning) interface, however, classically isn't even USB – it's typically a serial controller (a UART), connected either via RS-232  level signal or TTL signaling. The USB adapter typically just contains a USB-to-serial converter doing the desired signal levels. </p>

<p>It's much easier to electrically isolate RS-232 or TTL serial lines than USB. So do that, you can buy ready-made ICs and boards.</p>

<p>You don't <em>need</em> potential separation, however. Your transceiver's case is typically on the same level as your USB shielding or serial line signal ground. You might want to avoid noisy current loops – but you'd do that using filters/clamp-on ferrites, typically.</p>

<p>There's legitimate concern about coupling noise from switching electronics (e.g. computers) into transceivers – but it all boils down to shielding. And I'd expect your transceiver to shield and filter its inputs reasonably well – after all, what are you expecting when you accept a digital signal? It's going to come from a digital device.</p>

"How is Data Whitening done?","56","","<p>Is it safe to define that Data Whitening is always X-ORing a payload with a pheudorandom sequence known to both receiver and transmitter? </p>

<p>In more detail, lets assume the following case. I have the exact pseudorandom string that is used for Data Whitening of a SX-1234 transceiver (a random transceiver). Lets also assume that I have captured the <strong>already whitened payload</strong> received by another SX-1234 transceiver. Provided SX-1234 does not perform any other encoding steps other than data whitening, if I simply X-OR my received payload with the pseudorandom string, will I get back the originally transmitted data? </p>

<p>If not, what other methods are there for data whitening other than simple X-ORing. </p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Is it safe to define that Data Whitening is always X-ORing a payload with a pheudorandom sequence known to both receiver and transmitter?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, but that's a very common way of doing it. However, you can scramble and whiten a sequence by pushing it through an appropriate Linear Feedback Shift Register, and I'd assume that this is even more commonly applied in practice.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have the exact pseudorandom string that is used for Data Whitening of a SX-1234 transceiver (a random transceiver)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is a rather uncommon case. As said above, I'd assume most systems do NOT just XOR with a fixed sequence, but scramble the data itself.</p>

<p>And even for systems where the data is XOR'ed with a pseudorandom sequence, I'd assume that for whitening reasons, you'd want that sequence to be long. Such sequences aren't stored, but again, generated using things like linear feedback shift registers, or other algebraic approaches. Such a sequence can easily become <em>very</em> long. </p>

<p>So, unless SX-1234 is a very old standard, it's questionable that you ""captured"" the whole sequence. Maybe you mean you've got the generator for the same sequence? Then you ""only"" have to sync up to your data stream. </p>

<p>It's very hard to estimate the current state in that sequence from a short observation (that's a requirement for good pseudorandom generators, and it's often very desirable, again, for autocorrelation/whitening reasons). So your syncing can, often, only be approached by a brute force trial of all possible shift – a usually impractical approach.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Provided SX-1234 does not perform any other encoding steps other than data whitening, if I simply X-OR my received payload with the pseudorandom string, will I get back the originally transmitted data? </p>

<p>No. If SX-1234 is prudent enough to whiten the data, then it'll certainly also employ channel coding (and that can be, if you don't know anything about the channel code, pretty much encryption). Oh, and let's not forget interleaving, which, especially for systems that transmit long streams of data, is employed to convert burst errors into sporadic errors (which the channel code can much easier correct).</p>

"What function do high-pass filters in a direct conversion receiver perform?","56","","<p>Use case: I'm considering hacking into my SoftRock RXTX to bypass the filters, then add external filters. I'm wondering if I can use just the low-pass filters I've already built, or if there's a compelling reason I'd need to also build high-pass filters.</p>

<p>I know a low pass filter is necessary to attenuate harmonics in multiples of the LO. But what about high-pass filtering? Is it strictly necessary or no, and why? In other words, what reason(s) are there for removing frequencies below the band of interest prior to the mixer?</p>
","<p>So, I don't know the Softrock personally, but from your description, it's a <em>switching mixer</em> architecture.</p>

<h1>Receiver side</h1>

<p>What that means is that you mix not by multiplying the input signal with a single harmonic oscillation (a tone), but by switching it on and of.</p>

<h2>Pre-Mixer HPF</h2>

<p>Mathematically, this description is omitting one interesting detail: </p>

<p>The operation done with the input signal $r(t)$ of the downconcerter is not actually a multiplication with a perfect square wave, i.e. a wave that has the shape </p>

<p>$$l'(t)  =A \cdot \text{sgn}(\sin(2\pi f t))$$</p>

<p>but is actually just an ""on- and off"" switching; so in the half-periods where $l'$ would be negative, it's actually zero. This leads to an actual LO function</p>

<p>$$\begin{align}
l(t) &amp;= \max(l'(t), 0)\\
&amp;=A \max( \text{sgn}(\sin(2\pi f t),0)\\
&amp;=\frac12l'(t) +\frac A2
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>Whereas $l'$ has a time-average of zero, we can clearly see the DC offset of $\frac A2$ of $l(t)$!</p>

<p>Now, when multiplying </p>

<p>$$r(t) \cdot l(t) = \frac12 l'(t)r(t) + \frac A2 r(t)$$</p>

<p>we get the sub-$f$ content of $r(t)$ directly in baseband (to worsen it, amplified by $\frac A2$)! </p>

<p>So, with a switching down-mixer, you must have an <em>input</em> high-pass filter to avoid getting low-frequency input signal directly in your desired output band.</p>

<h2>Post-Mixer HPF</h2>

<p>On the output of the same mixer, you'd also want a DC-cancelling high pass filter – just because there's practically zero information in an arbitrary small bandwidth, but having a DC offset on your ADC will simply reduce your usable dynamic range. Anyway, that hpf is usually just the AC coupling you'd do anyways to get your signal onto the center of the $[0;V_\text{Full Scale}]$ range of the ADC.</p>

<h1>Transmitter side</h1>

<h1>Pre-Mixer</h1>

<p>You don't want DC offset from your DAC to reach the switching mixer – simply because that is typically simply a transistor, and imprinting a DC current would shift its operating point and possibly be detrimental to linearity.</p>

<h1>Post-Mixer</h1>

<p>The Mixer will introduce a DC current. You typically don't want that to reach your antenna, your HPA (same effect as for the switching transistor) or your baluns (which might be a DC short, anyway).</p>

","<p>I believe you may have misinterpreted the menu setting. You can select the packet   <strong><em>receiving</em></strong> band (main, right, left)  but the packet <strong><em>transmitting</em></strong> band is fixed on the main band.</p>

<p>The TinyTrak4 has a PTT input connection for the purpose of suppressing data transmissions when the transmitter is in use for other purposes. This would seem to be a good fit for your use case. To take advantage of this feature, simply route your microphone PTT line to this input. When the TT4 sees this input is grounded (via the microphone PTT), it will suppress transmissions.</p>

<p>If you are concerned about the TT4 interrupting a QSO when you are not transmitting but listening to the other station, you could add a delay timer (e.g. 555) to the PTT input to the TT4. Setting the timer for 4 or 5 minutes would hold of any TT4 transmissions during the course of most QSOs.</p>

<p>What would be a good strategy to divide effort between keeping our QSO rate up and collecting multipliers?</p>
","<p>The advice given to me was to go for rate and the multipliers will take care of themselves.</p>

<p>Even if your goal is to spend a fair amount of time running, there sill be times when you get bumped off your run frequency or you are looking for a run frequency or you are warming up or winding down and can spend some time doing search and pounce.  During these time you can still go for rate but how long you wait in pileups might be guided by whether it's a new multiplier or not.</p>

<p>Exactly how much time to spend on these is operator dependent, but you can game it pretty easily with a spreadsheet.</p>

<ul>
<li>Take your rate running, say 100 QSOs / hour</li>
<li>Take your rate cherry picking S&amp;P, say 35 QSOs / hour</li>
<li>Take your rate banging rare multiplier DX, say 12 / hour</li>
</ul>

<p>And graph that in a spreadsheet based on your current totals.  It changes over time, at the beginning, multipliers don't mean much, you give up 8 QSOs per S&amp;P multiplier and it doesn't move the score much.  Later on, when you have 1300 QSOs, that multiplier is worth a rare DX costs 8 (rounding down) QSOs</p>

<p>For instance, using the rates above, say you have 1300 QSOs and 80 multipliers.  Your score is 104000.  If you go for one more multiplier, you are at 1301 * 81 = 105381, versus continuing to run, 1308 * 80 = 104670 a difference of 741 points.</p>

<p>Of course, as time goes on, new multipliers are harder and harder to get so that rate goes down. This is where graphs are handy you can plot this all out with your rates as you go and that will tell you when to switch.  You can also add rate goals to your spreadsheet and things that will help you notice when a band is becoming unproductive and it may be time to switch bands or take a break.</p>

"FSK Rx sensitivity with different deviations","51","","<p>I used an RF generator transmitting FSK packets with a datarate of 50 kbps. The deviation was 12.5 kHz. With this combination of datarate and deviation the modulation index is 0.5. I found that my device undertest had an Rx sensitivity of ~102 dBm. The IF BW is approximately 100 kHz.</p>

<p>I left DUT settings untouched. I changed the deviation of the signal sent by the generator from 12.5 kHz to 25 kHz. Datarate remained 50 kbps. This equals to modulation index = 1.</p>

<p>I found out that the sensitivity was a few dB's better. Someone told me that it is because the symbols are further apart from each other in the freq plane, and thus it is easier for the radio to demodulate it. My question is, why the wider deviation is easier for the radio?</p>

<p>The radio uses low IF receiver. RF is fed to an I/Q- down conversion mixer. The I/Q signals are sampled by IF ADC.</p>
","<p>Your receiver has very wide, excessive bandwidth. The amount of noise power reaching the demodulator is a function of receiver bandwidth. With a narrow band transmitted signal, the noise power dominates the demodulated signal. As your transmitted signal becomes wider in bandwidth, it occupies more of the demodulated bandwidth so the signal to noise ratio is improved.</p>

<p>It may be helpful to think about this in the frequency domain and dividing the received bandwidth spectrum into FFT buckets. Each bucket can be described as having a signal to noise ratio. In those buckets with no signal, the SNR is 0. In the other buckets where there is a signal, the SNR is >0. If we now average the SNR of all of the buckets, we have the SNR of the entire received bandwidth. This analogy shows that for a given receiver and received bandwidth, the more buckets that contain the signal, the better the SNR as viewed over the entire received bandwidth.</p>

<p>It is  worth noting that your two examples transition between narrow band FM and wide band FM. When the DFSK modulation index, <em>h</em>, is >=1 the signal transitions from having two sidebands to a larger, potentially infinite, number of sidebands. It is also worth noting that the actual bandwidth of your DFSK signal will depend heavily on the keying shape or algorithm of your signal generator. An FM transmitter keyed directly with high dV/dt modulating signals will have a wide transmitted spectrum.</p>

<p>The so called Carson rule states that 98% of the signal power of an FM transmitter is contained within a bandwidth equal two times the sum of the deviation frequency and the modulation frequency, This is considered the minimum bandwidth to prevent excess distortion:</p>

<p>$$ BW_{98\%} = 2 \times  \left( \Delta F + FM \right) $$</p>

<p>If you would like to see an improvement in received signal sensitivity, use the minimum necessary transmit bandwidth and narrow your receiver IF bandwidth accordingly. This will minimize the noise power entering your demodulator and thus raise the SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) of the receiver. 
As an example, going from a 100 kHz receive bandwidth to a 15 kHz bandwidth will improve the SNR by over 8 dB.</p>

<p>$$ 10 \times log \left( \frac{BW_A}{BW_B} \right) = \Delta SNR $$</p>

"Power Density Function","51","","<p>A radio receiver needs $1 \textrm{ nW}/\textrm{m}^2$ of power density function, how far away from a 1-watt point source will it continue to work?</p>
","<p>So we have a point source, so it has no gain and radiates evenly in all directions. The result of that is that our waves will look like a sphere. Then we will have the receiver antenna into which those waves will impact. </p>

<p>That antenna has its own effective aperture (in the illustration, I used parabolic antenna, because the effect is most obvious with it), which is the area into which the waves from the transmitter impact. The part that impacts the Rx antenna will be received. In this problem, we don't have specifics of the Rx antenna, but we are given density of the power at the needed distance. </p>

<p>So how do we calculate power density? We simply take the formula for the surface of a sphere, $$P_s=4 \pi r^2 $$ Next, we spread out our 1 watt over that surface, so we have density of $$P_d=\frac{P_{Tx}}{P_s}=\frac{1\mbox{ }W}{4 \pi r^2}$$ Our problem says that $P_d=\frac{1\mbox{ } nW}{m^2}$, so we just need to solve the equation for $ r $ to get the final solution.</p>

"Why is the neper a useful unit for transmission line calculations?","49","","<p><a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/a/9758/218"">SWR Measured at the Transmitter versus SWR at the Antenna</a> says the neper is ""a more convenient unit for transmission line calculations"".</p>

<p>Why exactly? What is a neper, and what about it makes it more convenient than the more common decibel? Are there some examples of equations which are more complicated in decibels?</p>
","<p>A neper, just like a decibel, is a logarithmic expression of ratios. The decibel uses the base-10, or decadic, logarithm while the neper uses the natural, or Euler constant, logarithm.</p>

<p>The decibel is strictly defined as the ratio of two powers. </p>

<p>$$dB=10\log_{10}\left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right) \tag 1$$</p>

<p>While it is common to see a decibel formula based on voltage or current, such a ratio is only valid if the impedance of the two terms is the same.</p>

<p>The neper is simply defined as the ratio of voltage or current (or more generally, 'field' values):</p>

<p>$$Np=\ln\left(\frac{V_1}{V_2}\right) \text{ or } \ln\left(\frac{I_1}{I_2}\right) \tag 2$$</p>

<p>It can be shown that 1 neper is equal to $20\log_{10}(e)$ or about 8.6858 decibels.</p>

<p>One way to think about a natural logarithm is that it can be used to calculate how much time it takes to get a certain growth. The inverse function, e<sup>x</sup>, can be used to calculate growth given a certain amount of time. In fact e is sometimes referred to as the universal rate of growth.</p>

<p>This has many applications in the area of electronics. As an example, the formula for voltage across a capacitor as a function of time (growth/decay) as it discharges through a resistor makes use of this relationship:</p>

<p>$$V_C{(t)}=V_0*e^\left({\frac{-t}{RC}}\right) \tag 3$$</p>

<p>where R is the discharge resistance in ohms, C is the capacitance in Farads, t is the time in seconds, and V<sub>0</sub> is the initial voltage across the capacitor.</p>

<p>Similarly transmission line equations have the notion of growth or decay of voltage and current as a function of time or length. Transmission line attenuation is such as example. The attenuation of a transmission line ($\alpha$) is generally given as nepers/meter or nepers/kilometer. Thus for a given length of transmission line, the attenuated voltage at any point along the line is simply given as:</p>

<p>$$V_{(l)}=\frac{V_0}{e^{\alpha l}} \tag 4$$</p>

<p>where V<sub>0</sub> is the original voltage, $\alpha$ is the attenuation in nepers/meter, and l is the point in the transmission line in meters from the initial voltage V<sub>0</sub>.</p>

<p>The same form of the calculation using attenuation expressed in dB/meter results in:</p>

<p>$$V_{(l)}=\frac{V_0}{e^{\left(\frac{\alpha l}{8.6858}\right)}} \tag 5$$</p>

<p>where $\alpha$ is expressed in dBs/meter.</p>

<p>An alternative form to equation 5 would be:</p>

<p>$$V_{(l)}=\frac{V_0}{10^{\left(\frac{\alpha l}{20}\right)}} \tag 6$$</p>

<p>where again $\alpha$ is expressed in dBs/meter.</p>

<p>Thus it can be seen that equation 4 is slightly simpler in form compared to equation 5 or 6. The simplicity of equation 4 also makes the derivation of the ""rate of growth"" clearer. There is no need to ask, for example, what is the 8.6858 factor doing there?</p>

"Inquiry regarding thermal resistor noise","48","","<p>In the simplest form, how could thermal resistor noise be described? I've looked up online but just found the calculation part.</p>
","<p>Imagine an ordinary gas, like air, inside a room. If the room is perfectly sealed and the air is completely still, we can say that the average motion of all the gas molecules is zero. However, each individual molecule is taking a random path all over, colliding with the walls of the room and other molecules. The only way to get rid of this random motion of each molecule is to cool the gas to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_zero"" rel=""nofollow"">absolute zero temperature</a>.</p>

<p>If you had a sufficiently sensitive microphone, you'd hear those molecules hitting the microphone. But there are so many molecules hitting the microphone all the time that what you hear is noise.</p>

<p>The same thing happens in electronics, but instead of gas molecules, it's electric charges (in metals, electrons) that are moving around. When electric charges move, that's a current. And by Ohm's law, when there's a current through some resistance, there's also a voltage.</p>

<p>So with a sufficiently sensitive instrument, we can detect the individual electrons moving through the resistor as a result of random thermal motion.</p>

<p>The power of this noise is a function of temperature. As the resistor heats up, the electrons move around more, so there's more noise.</p>

<p>For practical calculation at room temperature, the noise power can be calculated in dBm by:</p>

<p>$$ -174 + 10 \log_{10}(\Delta f) $$</p>

<p>Here, $\Delta f$ is the bandwidth of interest, in hertz. For example, single sideband is typically within a 4kHz channel, so at room temperature the noise power within this channel is:</p>

<p>$$ -174 + 10 \log_{10}(4000\:\mathrm{Hz}) = -138\:\mathrm{dBm} $$</p>

<p>More precisely, noise power in watts can be calculated by:</p>

<p>$$ k_B T \Delta f $$</p>

<p>Where $k_B$ is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann%27s_constant"" rel=""nofollow"">Boltzmann's constant</a> in joules per kelvin, and the temperature $T$ is in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin"" rel=""nofollow"">kelvin</a>.</p>

<p>Note that these calculations of power assume that the noise is generated by some source impedance (say, a 50Ω antenna), and is going into an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impedance_matching"" rel=""nofollow"">equal impedance</a>. This is often the case in RF engineering and so works well because we can avoid introducing a resistance term in the equations. When this is not the case, it can be more convenient to calculate the RMS noise voltage, which is:</p>

<p>$$ \sqrt{ 4 k_B T R \Delta f } $$</p>

<p>Likewise the RMS noise current is</p>

<p>$$ \sqrt{ 4 k_B T\Delta f \over R} $$</p>

","<p>So, I asked you to reduce the gain and disable AGC (auto-gain control), and you asked my to explain why :)</p>

<p>That had the effect of the RTL chipset no longer ""overloading"" its ADC with values that lead to negative values in the DSP chain (which is integrated in the RTL chip, I presume).</p>

<p>Normally, an AGC jobs is to adjust the gain so that exactly that doesn't happen. I don't know why yours didn't do that – but it's very probable that the RTL dongle's AGC , being designed for TV, is optimized to <strong>ignore</strong> single carriers (e.g. interference and, in analog TV, pilot tones).</p>

<p>With that out of the way:</p>

<p>Don't you have a <em>pretty</em> signal!
That's extrodinarily clean.</p>

<p>So, this is the old complex signal and positive vs negative frequencies business. </p>

<p>Because you've set your receiver to the center between the higher and lower (FSK) subcarriers, we see them at $+f_\Delta$ and $-f_\Delta$. Now, negative frequencies only exist in complex signals. </p>

<p>A complex tone of frequency $f$ is defined as </p>

<p>$$e^{j2\pi f t}$$</p>

<p>with $j=\sqrt{-1}$ being the imaginary unit, and $t$ being time. </p>

<p>Then, Euler tells us:</p>

<p>$$e^{jx} = \cos (x) + j\sin(x)\text{ ,}$$</p>

<p>or applied to our harmonic signal</p>

<p>$$e^{j2\pi f t} = \cos (2\pi ft) + j\sin(2\pi ft)\text{ .}$$</p>

<p>Now, the cosine is the <em>Real part</em>, ie. what is visualized as the ""upper"" channel in your program, and the sine is the <em>Imaginary part</em>, what's visualized as ""lower"" channel.</p>

<p>Now, what's the difference between two signals at $+f_\Delta$ and $-f_\Delta$? Let's just compare:</p>

<p>$$\begin{align}
e^{-j2f_\Delta t} &amp;= \cos(-2\pi f_\Delta ) &amp;&amp;+ j\sin(-2\pi f_\Delta)\\
&amp;&amp;&amp;\text{We know that $\cos$ is symmetric, $\cos(-x)=\cos(x)$,}\\
&amp;&amp;&amp;\text{and that $\sin$ is anti-symmetric, $\sin(-x)=-\sin(x)$.}\\
 &amp;= \cos(-2\pi f_\Delta ) &amp;&amp;+ j\sin(-2\pi f_\Delta)\\
&amp;= \cos(2\pi f_\Delta ) &amp;&amp;- j\sin(2\pi f_\Delta)\\\\
e^{j2f_\Delta t} &amp;= \cos(2\pi f_\Delta ) &amp;&amp;+ j\sin(2\pi f_\Delta)\\
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>So, the difference between a positive frequency and it's negative counterpart is only that the sign of the imaginary part is flipped. Flipping a sign is nothing but a simple 180° phase shift. </p>

<p>That's exactly what's happening here. </p>

<p>Furthermore, because you can't know the phase of the complex tone compared to your receiver's oscillator, the real part isn't actually a sine (a sine has value $0$ for $t=0$, right) and the imaginary part not really a cosine, but both are shifted by a random phase; that means that when you jump between $+f_\Delta$ and $-f_\Delta$, both tones make a phase jump (and not just the imaginary part). To know whether the frequency is positive, or negative, is however pretty simple:</p>

<p>A cosine is simply a sine, but with a ""phase advantage"" of quarter a wave, or $\frac{2\pi}4 =\frac\pi2$. So, all you need to figure out at any point is ""is the real part $\frac\pi2$ in front of the imaginary part, or the other way around?"", and BOOM, there you go, FSK demodulator :)</p>

<p>This is simply not true. The standard literature on radio theory, wave propagation and the like all use currents and current densities that are coherent with the electrical field. And that goes from positive to negative potential. That implies that current should flow in the same direction.</p>

"SWR Measured at the Transmitter versus SWR at the Antenna","42","","<p>It is fairly well understood that due to transmission line losses, the SWR as measured at the transmitter will be less than the SWR at the antenna.</p>

<p>Some of the new antenna analyzers and some vector network analyzers can 'zero out' or compensate for the losses in the transmission line. This allows them to display the SWR at the antenna while taking the SWR measurement at the transmitter end.</p>

<p>Can something similar be done using a much less expensive, conventional SWR meter or dual needle SWR meter?</p>
","<p>Given the matched loss of the feedline and the SWR at the transmitter, we can calculate the SWR at the antenna in three simple steps.</p>

<p>First convert the SWR at the transmitter to the corresponding magnitude of the reflection coefficient (Gamma), or MRC for short within the context of this answer. The MRC is the magnitude of the complex ratio of the reflected voltage wave to that of the incident voltage wave. We can calculate the MRC using this formula:</p>

<p>$$|\Gamma|=\frac {\text{SWR}-1}{\text{SWR}+1} \tag 1$$</p>

<p>where SWR is the SWR (without the :1 notation) at the point of measurement. </p>

<p>For example, if the SWR at the transmitter is 3:1, the corresponding MRC ($|\Gamma|$) at the transmitter is 0.5.</p>

<p>Now we convert this MRC at the transmitter to its corresponding MRC at the antenna by reversing the effect of the losses in the feedline:</p>

<p>$$|\Gamma_{\text{ant}}|=\frac{|\Gamma_{\text{xmtr}}|}{e^{(-2*L_{\text{dB}}/8.6858)}} \tag 2$$</p>

<p>where L<sub>dB</sub> is the matched loss of the feedline in dB. Note that the division by 8.6858 converts dB loss to Nepers - a more convenient unit for transmission line calculations. The effect of this loss on SWR has been described in <a href=""https://ham.stackexchange.com/questions/9722/does-coax-limit-the-maximum-swr-a-transmitter-sees"">Does Coax Limit the Maximum SWR a Transmitter Sees</a>.</p>

<p>Using formula 2 with a feedline that has a matched loss of 1.0 dB along with the previously calculated 0.5 MRC at the transmitter, we find that we have an MRC of 0.63 at the antenna. We can now convert this to the SWR at the antenna using the formula:</p>

<p>$$\text{SWR}=\frac{1+|\Gamma|}{1-|\Gamma|} \tag 3$$</p>

<p>So we find using formula 3, that the SWR that measured 3:1 at the transmitter 
is 4.4:1 at the antenna.</p>

<p>These formulas are not too difficult to do on a hand calculator, but by placing them into a spreadsheet, it is possible to construct a nice chart depicting the transmitter SWR versus antenna SWR for a given amateur band:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lXAdv.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lXAdv.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>What is ""Low 2"" and ""Low 1""? What are they used for?</p>
","<p>I don't have one of these radios, but as a matter of interpreting the text of the manual, page 8 says that one of the “programmable function key” functions is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>OUTPUT POWER SELECTION KEY</em></strong><br>
  Select the transmit output power
  temporarily or permanently, depending on the pre-setting.<br>
  • Ask your dealer for the output power level for each selection</p>

<p>From this, I conclude that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The radio has at least three transmit power levels, two of which are called “Low 2” and “Low 1”. Perhaps if you push that key it will cycle through those names on the alphanumeric display along with one or more “high” power settings.</p></li>
<li><p>Likely the reason they are not called something more descriptive is that they are arbitrarily programmable and the decision was made not to display the actual power in watts or dBm.</p></li>

<li>Whereas if we have a calculation of 8dBm - (-90dBm)= 98dB this is represented as 98dB and not 8dBm?
Shouldn't we convert both the dBm like <code>(10^0.8-10^(-9))</code> and then convert into dBm.</li>
</ol>

<p>Could someone hep me explain why we represent the first equations result in dBm whereas the second equations result in dB?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>I convert the 27dBm and 3dBm -> <code>10^2.7-10^0.3</code>. But how can we simply subtract the two dBm</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you convert to exponential form then you must simultaneously replace subtraction with division (or addition with multiplication), so you have $10^{2.7} / 10^{0.3}$ instead of $10^{2.7} - 10^{0.3}$. Then you will see that you get the same result:</p>

<p>$$2.7 - 0.3 = 2.4$$</p>

<p>$$\frac{10^{2.7}}{10^{0.3}} = 10^{2.4}$$</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>why we represent the first equations result in dBm whereas the second equations result in dB?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first one is incorrect and the second one is correct. (There must be something else wrong with what you wrote down, because it is not the case that $27 - 3 = 27$, of course.)</p>

<p>Any time you subtract two dB values with a reference level specified (dBm, dBW, dBFS, etc.) you get a ratio expressed as decibels, which is independent of the reference level and therefore should not be written with one.</p>

<p>$$  27\,\mathrm{dBm} - 3\,\mathrm{dBm}=24 \,\mathrm{dB} $$</p>

<p>$$  27\,\mathrm{dBm} - 3\,\mathrm{dBm} \neq 24 \,\mathrm{dBm} \tag{dimensionally incorrect} $$</p>

<p>To understand <em>why</em> these are the rules, consider this exercise:</p>

<p>If we have 1000 mW (or 30 dBm), that is the same as 1 W (or 0 dBW).</p>

<p>Now suppose we compare that to 100 mW, 20 dBm; 0.1 W, -10 dBW. Again, all of these are the same power expressed differently. If we subtract decibels, or divide the regular values, then we get the same number out:</p>

<p>$$
\begin{align*}
1000\,\mathrm{mW} / 100\,\mathrm{mW} &amp;= 10
&amp;
30\,\mathrm{dBm} - 20\,\mathrm{dBm} &amp;= 10 \,\mathrm{dB}
\\
1\,\mathrm{W} / 0.1\,\mathrm{W} &amp;= 10
&amp;
0\,\mathrm{dBW} - (-10\,\mathrm{dBW}) &amp;= 10 \,\mathrm{dB}
\end{align*}
$$</p>

<p>When you <strong>divide</strong> two figures with equal units, you get a unitless (dimensionless) number. When you <strong>subtract</strong> two dB values with the same reference level, the reference level goes away. These are exactly the same mathematical phenomenon.</p>

","<p>Your presumption about how it functions is correct. The skip time is a global setting for all timed skip operations. It is set from the main Menu.</p>

  <p>Since one macro can call another, you may wonder if macro 500 could
  call 501, which could call 502, which could call 503, etc., until you

  limits. One is that if the total time it takes the processor to decode
  and execute the whole chained macro sequence is more than one half
  second or so, the controller may reset itself. It is unlikely that you
  will ever reach this limit (it would probably take more than 20 macros
  are hooked together even come close to this limit). The other limit
  restricts how deeply the macros can be nested (called from another
  macro). This is not a limit on how many commands can be called inside
  of a macro. It is not a limit on how many macros can be executed from
  one Mac. It is a limit on one macro calling another macro that calls
  another macro that calls another macro.</p>
</blockquote>
","<p>Each macro can hold 100 bytes.</p>

<p>There are 200 standard commands, another 300 that are for internal macros and another 500 for user macros.</p>

There I found only one reference to a maximum command length, and it also happens to mention a macro maximum length.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The message length is limited to the maximum command length (about 200
  characters) or if used in a macro, by the space left in a macro (less
  than 100 characters).</p>

It says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q: What are the macro size limits on the RLC-Club?   </p>
  
  <p>A: All RLC-Club macros can hold up to 100 bytes. A byte of macro
  storage roughly corresponds with a digit stored in it, but that
  relationship isn't exact. The easiest way to find out how much space a
  macro takes is to program it, then ask the controller how full the
  macro is with command 054. If you want to figure it out manually, use
  the equation 1 + (3 * NumCommands) + TotalDataDigits =
  MacroSizeInBytes. For example:</p>

<pre><code> 055 500                 ; erase macro - doesn't use any space
 056 500 036 001 002 003 ; speak ""one two three"" - one command, 9 data digits
 056 500 038             ; be quiet - one command, no data digits
 056 500 000 12          ; connect ports 1 and 2 - one command, 2 data digits
 ;
 Total space used = 1 + ( 3 * 3 ) + 11 = 21 bytes.

<ol>
<li>The maximum size of a command is ""about 200 characters"".</li>
<li>The maximum size of a macro is 100 bytes which is ""less than 100 characters"".</li>

<p>I do remember from secondary school the experiment of having a capacitor and a coil in resonance, increasing voltage. Is this why both happen at the same time?</p>
","<p>In general, when you see a block diagram, the point of it is that the blocks contain multiple or unspecified elements, but the diagram accurately represents the boundaries of, and connections between, those elements.</p>

<p>“Tuning” is not a single process, and in most receivers the amplification is in multiple stages interleaved with the “tuning” elements, so having a “tuning” block followed by an “amplification” block (or vice versa) would be incorrect.</p>

<p>“Tuning” consists of both <em>filtering</em> and <em>mixing</em>, and filtering and amplification are usually desired both before and after the mixer(s).</p>

<hr>

<p>Another question we can ask is: given that the receiver is a complex system of many elements, why did the author of this diagram sum it up in these particular three blocks?</p>

<p>If I had made it that way, it would be because these three can be characterized as:</p>

<ul>
<li>The first block deals exclusively in RF and IF signals, and does not change the form of the signal — only its amplitude and carrier frequency.</li>
