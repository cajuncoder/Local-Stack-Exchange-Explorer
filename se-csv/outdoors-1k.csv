"How do you determine how long a hike will take?","237353","","<p>Is there a general rule of thumb for converting miles to hours when looking at a potential hike? For example, how long does it take an average person walking at an average speed to walk a mile on the following types of trails:</p>

<ul>
<li>a mostly flat, easy trail</li>
<li>a moderate trail, with some elevation changes</li>
<li>a strenuous hike, with significant elevation change or difficult terrain</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm thinking of a day hike on maintained trails with people that are neither experienced hikers nor completely out of shape. Basically, the number you'd put in a book or website listing trails and approximate hiking times. But it sounds like even that might be too hard to come up with for a general case.</p>
","<p>You could use Naismith's rule which goes as follows:</p>

<p>Allow 1 hour for every 3 miles (5 km) forward, plus 1 hour for every 2000 feet (600 metres) of ascent.</p>

<p>A lot of hikers in the UK use this as a guide of course bear in mind terrain and altitude! and of course this is not appropriate at higher altitudes.</p>

<p>Some <a href=""http://www.goxplore.net/guides/Naismith%27s_Rule"">sites</a> recommend corrections to the above:</p>

<p>Gentle descent: subtract 10 minutes for every 1000ft / 300m of descent
Steep descent: add 10 minutes for every 1000ft / 300m of descent</p>

<p>... which got me thinking, how high is too high? </p>

<p>I'd guess it's reasonably low. So does anyone have any <strong>empirical evidence</strong> of how high a fall a human being can fall and survive (though not necessarily walk away from)?</p>
","<p>It's not the fall that gets you, it's the sudden stop at the end.  The most detailed data on the effects of large accelerations (or equivalently, decelerations) on the human body comes from research into spaceflight and aircraft ejection systems.  There is a very detailed <a href=""http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19930020462.pdf"">paper from NASA here</a>, from which figure 5 (p. 36) is most useful.</p>

<p>The summary is:</p>

<ul>
<li>it depends a lot on where and which way up you land - feet-first onto a soft surface is best (pretty obvious)</li>
<li>For a hard surface, assuming you don't land on your head, up to about 12m/s impact velocity, you are almost certain to survive (corresponding to a fall from a height of just over 7m).  Though ""survive"" is likely to involve life-changing injuries at the top of this range</li>
<li>Between 12 and 17m/s you may or may not survive (corresponding to about 7m - 12m)</li>
<li>Over 17m/s you are almost certain not to survive (corresponding to over 12m)</li>

"How long does water need to be boiled for to kill all bacteria / viruses?","161664","","<p>This has come up a few times in a few other questions, but I've heard varying opinions from different people in a number of answers and comments on here - some saying that just boiling for a moment is enough, others saying that to be sure you should boil for around 10 minutes, and others saying it doesn't matter how long you boil for because some bacteria can survive it with no problem.</p>

<p>So in short, how long should you boil water you've collected for to ensure it's safe to drink? (I'm discounting filtering like metals which boiling won't remove.) It'd be good if answers could be referenced / backed up since people do seem to have different ideas on the subject!</p>

"How much should your backpack weigh?","122919","","<p>For a multi-day backpacking trip, what is the ideal weight of a backpack? </p>

<p>And what is that max weight that no sane human should go over?</p>
","<p>The ideal weight is zero. The less weight you carry the more you will enjoy your outing.</p>

<p>That being said, one should try to minimize their weight within reason. There exist different schools (Ultralight, super-ultralight, etc.) on what one should carry and how much it should weight. </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/ultralight-backpacking.html"">REI suggest</a> the following categories:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>minimalist - Under 12 pounds (~5.5kg)</li>
  <li>ultralight - Around 20 pounds (~9kg)***</li>
  <li>lightweight - Up to 30 pounds (~13.5kg)</li>
  <li>plush/deluxe - Over 30 pounds</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>*** Typically, in the UL community ultra light is defined as under 10 pounds (~4.5kg). With the popularity of the ultra light movements some big manufactures and stores started branding certain equipment as <em>ultralight</em> although they would be considered too heavy by many UL backpackers.</p>

<p>It is easier to compare packing weights by dividing the weight of items which will remain constant over the course of the trip and the ones who will vary such as consumable items (food, water, etc.).</p>

<p>The constant weight is called the base weight. Super Ultralight (SUL) backpackers aim for a base weight of under 5lbs (2.3 kg). Often this is very dependent on the trip location and weather.</p>

<p>On the other extreme, soldiers can carry from 40-90+ lbs (~18–40+kg) on missions.</p>

<p>My subjective suggestion is the following: I would aim for a <strong>base weight of under 15 lbs (~6.8 kg)</strong>. With food and water included I would aim for under 30lbs (~13.5 kg) and at 20 lbs (~9 kg) I'm a happy hiker heading to town.</p>

<p>It's important to bear in mind that water weights 2.2lbs (1 kg) per liter and is a big factor in the total weight. Depending on the availability of reliable water sources your total backpack weight may be greatly affected. Food usually is about 2 lbs (nearly 1 kg) per day. Food and water should make for 50%+ of your weight.</p>

<p>Edit:  I talked to my doc and the location of the pain is very important in the cause.  Note that this is pain on the outside (side) of the knee specifically, as opposed to pain in the knee or below/under the kneecap.</p>
","<p>Talked to my doc today during a visit for something else.  It's <a href=""http://www.sportsinjuryclinic.net/sport-injuries/knee-pain/iliotibial-band-syndrome"">Iliotibial Band Syndrome</a>.

"How to warm up your cold toes and fingers?","114976","","<p>In winter your hand and feet (especially toes and fingers) may get painfully cold or you may even stop feeling them. How can you warm them up?</p>

<p>This usually happens, when it's below 0°С or when it's slightly above 0°С and your hands/feet are wet.
This can happen if you are not properly dressed/booted or you are not moving enough (e.g. sitting in a camp after a day hike).</p>

<p>(Question inspired by a question on <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/3823/winter-camping-how-to-warm-up-your-boots-in-the-morning"">warming up your boots in the morning</a>)</p>
","<p>I'm answering my own question to share some knowledge.</p>

<p>First, cold toes/fingers is serious. You start feeling discomfort, then a little pain, then you stop feeling them and forget about them, then you get them amputated. So you should <strong>constantly check if you can still feel toes and fingers</strong>, and if not, start to warm them up.</p>

<p>Second, I find most effective and easy the following method of heating:</p>

<ul>
<li>To warm up toes, <strong>swing your leg back-and-forward 30-50 times</strong>. The movement is done with the whole leg (including the thigh), as wide as possible, and it should be powerful.</li>
<li>To warm up your fingers, make similar motion with your arms, except that you can go 360-degree.</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember to make your full 30-50 swings before saying ""blah, it's not working"";)</p>

<p>What happens is you warm blood is driven by centripetal force to flow to the extreme parts of your legs/arms: toes and fingers. Normally they don't get much blood in cold conditions, because your body regulation mechanisms try to keep more warmth at the center of the body by thinning peripherial vessels (it's an overreaction).</p>

<p>If you weren't feeling your fingers/toes before starting this, warming up might be very painful. So it's better to do 20, small pause to let heat reach frozen tissues, a little screaming, another 20;)</p>

<p>Note: if you weren't feeling your toes or fingers for a long time, things may have gone beyond simple treatment. I'm not sure this method is advised in such situation, because it provides fast heating, and all recommendations for treating serious frostbites prescribe slow heating (also see <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/42/what-do-i-do-to-prevent-and-treat-frostbite"">this question about frostbites</a>).</p>

"What are areas of the body which lose heat more quickly, and how can I reduce that loss?","103351","","<p>What are the higher heat loss areas of the body and how can I reduce heat loss in those areas?</p>
","<p><em>My <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/681/what-are-the-high-heat-loss-areas-of-the-body-and-how-can-i-reduce-loss/690#690"">original answer</a> to this question sparked a surprisingly intense debate, so I'm rewriting it to clarify a few points and offer a more holistic answer.</em></p>

<p>Let me start by saying that every square inch of skin on the human body is capable of allowing heat to escape. That is to say, if you wear a jacket with no pants, your legs will lose more heat than your torso -- but if you wear pants with no jacket, your torso will lose more heat than your legs. Both areas are capable of losing heat -- and will do so more quickly when exposed. Therefore, any part of your body that's more exposed to the cold than another part has the potential to lose more heat than other than parts that are less exposed.</p>

<p>This is fairly obvious, but I mention it for completeness' sake. This generally means that you should try to cover yourself as much as possible, especially larger skin surfaces like the torso.</p>

<p>However, the point that I think the OP is trying to get at is that -- all else being equal -- <strong>every square inch of exposed human skin does NOT lose heat at the same rate</strong>. That is to say, <strong>some areas of skin lose heat faster than others.</strong> If you were to stand in the cold totally naked, some parts of you would lose heat more quickly than others. This is an indisputable, biological fact. Allow me to explain:</p>

<p>Human blood serves many functions -- one of which is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_blood#Thermoregulation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">thermoregulation</a>. As an evolutionary adaption, humans have areas on their body that are especially suited for releasing heat, in order to cool us off when we get too hot. In these areas, there is a high volume of blood flow, and that blood passes very close to the skin. These areas are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The skull</li>
<li>The groin</li>
<li>The armpits</li>
<li>Some might also say the extremities, like fingers and toes.</li>
</ul>

<p>In these areas, there is a lot of blood flowing around, and the skin is fairly thin, allowing heat to escape from the blood more quickly than in other areas.</p>

<p>Therefore, if you are in a desperate survival situation where you risk hypothermia, these are the areas of the body you should focus on keeping the warmest. </p>

<p><strong>Armpits</strong> are fairly easy to keep warm, just keep your elbows down and they'll be insulated by your torso and upper arm. </p>

<p>It's important to keep warm, dry underwear in order to keep your <strong>groin</strong> warm as well. </p>

<p>And yes, <strong>YOU SHOULD WEAR A HAT.</strong> While you might not lose the ""majority"" of body heat through your head, it is one of the areas of skin that loses heat most quickly and it should be one of the main things you focus on keeping warm.</p>

<p>The extremities are also important to keep warm. I have friends that go out jogging in the winter wearing shorts and a t-shirt. They don a warm beanie and gloves right before they go out, and those are all it takes to keep them warm in freezing temperatures.</p>

<p><strong>In summary:</strong>
If you have clothes or ways to protect every inch of skin on your body, you should do that. I thought this was basic common sense, but people were squabbling so I'll reiterate. </p>

<p>However, if you only have limited means of protection and you need to focus on warming only a small area of your body, you're best off focusing on the four areas listed above.</p>

"How to avoid exploding rocks","101590","","<p>It seems that every tutorial I read and show I watch shows people using rocks for everything from a cooking surface to boiling water.  However, I have had rocks crack in half on me, and I've always been warned that they can explode from rapidly expanding moisture embedded within them.</p>

<p>How much of a risk is this and how is it best avoided?  A nice flat rock is a great cooking surface in the woods, so if there's a safe way to use them, I would like to.</p>
","<p>There's two main things that generally cause this, the first being the moisture content in the rock and the second being the type of rock. If the rock is wet and you heat it rapidly, any water will turn to steam and put pressure on the rock, forcing shards of it to break off rapidly. Secondly the type of rock matters, layered rocks such as sandstone are much more likely to split and perhaps explode because of the weaker bonds between their layers. As pointed out below, watch out for very smooth rocks - a sign that they may have been on a river bed at some point in their lives and therefore have water trapped deep in them.</p>

<p>If you choose hard, dry, un-layered rocks then you should be fine. When in doubt, you can build your fire on top of the rock the first night and heat it up safely covered to drive out whatever moisture may be trapped.</p>

"How do I tie a sleeping bag to my backpack?","78654","","<p>I recently upgraded to a modern backpack and I'm stumped as to how to tie accessories down to it.

<p>My <a href=""http://www.gregorypacks.com/products/mens/technical/83/z-55"">new pack</a> lacks these generic tie-down anchors, and instead has two (smallish) straps on the bottom.  They're perhaps large enough for my tent, but certainly not large enough for my sleeping bag.</p>

<p>There's a waterproof ""top lid"" that can bind down, it's not impossible to stuff the sleeping bag between the pack and the top lid and cinch it down, but this is sort of awkward and top-heavy.</p>

<p>What's the proper strategy here?  Any tips for attaching my sleeping bag and tent to my pack?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>:  I'm not totally opposed to putting my tent and sleeping bag <em>in</em> the pack, especially for short and light trips, but on a multi-week outing, I may end up with the lion's share of the gear and food to haul, depending on the company.  If there's a clever way to have stuff outside my pack, it would be nice to have the option.</p>
","<p>If your sleeping bag, or its compression bag, doesn't have straps around the outside, you'll need at least four pieces of twine to strap your bag down. Two to loop around the sleeping bag, and two more to link the loops on your bag to the loops on your backpack.</p>

<p>Make sure the pieces intended for linking the sleeping bag to the backpack are tied down by the pieces looping the sleeping bag.</p>

<p>In 2009, there was, unfortunately, a <a href=""http://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/natural-intelligence/Canis-Soup.html"">fatality in Cape-Breton Nova-Scotia</a>. This was the second recorded fatality in North America.</p>

Still, if I am going to be on the trail for a few days in a row, I will develop numerous blisters on my feet.</p>

<p>I have read some suggestions in the past, like an alcohol based solution that mildly dries the skin, and can help harden skin over a long period of time. This is supposed to be dangerous if you dry the skin out too much though. I try to walk barefoot on various surfaces when the weather allows to toughen my feet up with some success.</p>

<p>What are other methods that are safe to harden the skin on your feet? This does not need to be a quick remedy. </p>
","<p>I've never succeed in ""hardening"" my feet against blisters, even when I was barefoot growing up. </p>

<p>However these things have worked for me</p>

<ol>
<li>Vaseline or (preferably) diaper rash ointment before putting on socks  </li>
<li><a href=""http://www.injinji.com/"">Injinji toe socks</a> (If I double socks, these are always my base layer)  </li>
</ol>

<p>These worked on long hikes even when my feet got wet, and even in poorly fitting boots.  Foot blisters from hiking are caused by friction.  Toe socks, in my experience, negate 99% of the friction between and around your toes.  Diaper rash ointment has two purposes.  It repels moisture, and damp feet are the highest friction.  It is also ridiculously slick, and doesn't wipe or wash off easily.  The slick nature reduces friction, and the durability means it is very likely to last for the entire hike.</p>

<p>A lot of powders are sold and used, even baby powder, but in my experience those increase friction once they get damp.  </p>

<p>Another common product is runner's lube (like <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000TS8MHG"">Mueller Lube Stick</a>).  I've never noticed any improvement over diaper rash ointment and runners lube costs more.</p>

<p>I was thinking maybe I should of just put it out of its misery though, a cat has obviously mauled it badly. </p>

<p>What's the easiest/most humane way to kill an injured bird? </p>
","<p>In the UK you should probably contact the <a href=""http://www.rspca.org.uk/home"">RSPCA</a> or <a href=""http://www.rspb.org.uk/"">RSPB</a>.

I presume other countries have similar charities.</p>

<p>If you need to kill the bird yourself I think the best way, without specialist equipment, is to wring its neck. If you do it properly it should kill the bird pretty much instantly. However, you need to make sure to commit fully and not do a half assed job that will cause it more suffering. This is mainly an issue if you are a bit squeamish about it.</p>

The closest thing to ""rubbing two sticks together"" is the <strong>hand-drill</strong>. You will need a fireboard (a small cedar board is good) and a thin, straight stick. A knife is good, too. This takes a lot of practice. Hand callouses help. YouTube has many videos: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=hand+drill+fire"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Fire Plow (YouTube)</a>.</p>

Even further on the skill end of the scale is the <strong>fire plow</strong>. Basically you push a stick along a groove in a board.

Again, see YouTube: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=fire%20plow"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Fire Plow (YouTube)</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Successful friction fires requires both good equipment and good technique.</strong> If you are just starting out, and you won't know if your failures are caused by equipment or technique. This can make learning very difficult. One fix is to buy a good set from an expert. Learn to make fires with it, then make your own kit. </p>

<p>Making any fire requires <strong>multiple skills</strong>, which you apply in a sequence. A friction method will produce a tiny coal. Once you've mastered that, you still need to be able to make the coal in to a flame (with tinder). Once your tinder is going, you need to light the kindling. Usually you'll add progressively larger fuel to grow the fire for your purposes. Then you need to know <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/89/how-to-be-absolutely-sure-my-fire-is-safely-extinguished"">how to put the fire out safely</a>. </p>

<p>Each of these stages is its own set of skills to learn. Each is contextual (type of wood available, season, weather, etc.). </p>

<p><strong>Wet weather</strong> is especially challenging, so start learning when it's not raining. However, watch out for your dry season, when runaway fires are particularly risky. Check with your fire department for <strong>burn bans</strong>. </p>

As people will know opening a tent in the wee hours of the morning will lose all the heat accumulated through the day and take a long time to warm back up. It warming up is nearly impossible if a certain someone has to keep leaving, bolting for open ground.</p>

<p>My question is this: What methods / equipment can be used to warm a tent up rather quickly?</p>
","<p>Basically you should never find yourself in such a situation under normal circumstances. Tents are supposed to keep you warm, and not the other way round. If you are doing that more often then I'd say you have the wrong gear being used at the wrong place.
Yet, there may rise a situation when you need to do it, there are ways to do it, but honestly you'll need to be very careful and cautious about them.
Firstly, Larger tents require more heating, and require more insulation to keep the heat in.</p>

<ol>
<li>The weather will keep on making it cold, so I'll say as a preventive measure you should try and arrange something that can keep you warm, and then may be think about having something that keeps the whole tent warm from inside. Its always necessary to have a insulation between you and the ground, you can do that by means of using air mattresses and inflatable sleeping pads, these are convenient to carry.

<li>As an additional measure you can put a lukewarm water bottle in the sleeping bag before getting into bed.</li>

"Does eating snow help dehydration?","45556","","<p>I have heard many people say that eating snow actually can increase dehydration since the energy required for the body to heat up and melt the snow is greater than the benefits received from the moisture in the snow. </p>

<p>Truth or fiction? And please back it with solid physiological evidence.</p>
","<p>The calories to melt even frozen water are pretty small, and the water gained is certainly greater than that used to aid the use of those calories.</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorie"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorie</a></p>

<p>So 1 calorie = 1 degree celcius (roughly with minor variation).  Okay easy.  Except it takes 30 times that to melt it initially.  Screw snow, let's figure on ice cubes.</p>

<p>1 liter of water frozen to ice 
1 liter water = 1 kg water, (1000c * 30) 30,000 calories to for the first degree and then 36500 for the next 36.5° (to achieve 37.5 °C, temperature of the human body)</p>

<p>66500 little c calories</p>

<p>That's 66.5 dietary calories, because a dietary calorie is actually a kilocalorie.</p>

<p>How much water does it take to process 66.5 dietary calories?  No where <em>near</em> a liter or we'd all be dead the next time we ate a christmas supper.  </p>

<p>But if you're <em>still</em> in doubt... well average daily intake is 2000 calories.  So if we assume ice is net negative then it must take more than a liter of water per 66.5 calories... which means that the human daily intake of water would need to be <strong>30 liters</strong>.</p>

"Which will keep my food colder longer, draining the melted ice water, or leaving it in the cooler?","45508","","<p>Say you have a cooler of frozen food and ice to last for several days or weeks of river-trip / car camping. To keep things as a cold as possible for as long as possible, is it better to leave the cold melted ice-water in, or to drain it out on a regular basis?</p>
","<p>From a thermodynamics point of view, I'd say you should leave the water in.  </p>

<p>Temperature is a measure of the active kinetic energy of the molecules in a substance. Warming up is essentially the surrounding environment imparting some of its kinetic energy into the object being warmed up.  Simply thinking about that, the more you have that needs warming, the more energy it requires to warm, and so the slower its temperature will rise (given the same rate of exchange of thermal energy - the water submerges at least some of the other contents, so if anything this is an overestimate).  Now consider that water has a relatively high specific heat, meaning that it takes more energy to warm it up.  The food inside the cooler won't be warmed up faster than the surrounding water, so since it takes more energy to heat the food and water than just the food, so the food will stay cooler longer.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.igloocoolers.com/FAQs?topic=General%20Product%20Information#q3"">Igloo (yes, the cooler company) FAQ</a> supports this view:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>During use, it is not necessary to drain the cold water from recently melted ice unless it is causing contents to become soggy. The chilled water, combined with ice, more readily surrounds canned and bottled items and will often help keep contents colder more effectively than the remaining ice alone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://www.coleman.com/coleman/colemancom/ProdAdvice.asp?CategoryID=8500"">Coleman agrees</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don’t drain cold water – Water from just-melted ice keeps contents cold almost as well as ice and preserves the remaining ice much better than air space. Drain the water only when necessary for convenient removal of cooler contents or before adding more ice. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think the key point a lot of people forget is that what matters isn't how long the ice lasts, but how long the contents remain under some temperature.</p>

<hr>

<p>Assuming convection is fairly significant relative to the rate of energy input from the outside (a good assumption, I think), it doesn't matter how good an insulator air is, the inside temperature will be the same throughout, necessitating that the rate of heat energy coming into the cooler is the same in both cases, so the ice will melt at the same rate, and once the ice is gone, the cooler with water will take much longer to warm.  I'm still working on the no-convection theory (which would provide at best an <em>extreme</em> overestimate), but in the meantime if anyone wishes to posit that convection is tiny enough to bridge the enormous gap (assuming I find the upper bound does eclipse water), please explain why you believe so.</p>

<hr>

<p>Some math/physics to back this up for the quantitatively inclined.  (This would be so much easier with the MathML markup from the math and physics sites.)</p>

<p>The cooler will be very near perfect convection, the heat is entering the cooler slowly enough that the contents - air, water, and ice - are at the same temperature (namely 32°F/0°C/273.15K). Heat conduction, <code>H</code>, as far as our coolers are concerned depends only on <code>ΔT</code>: <code>H = kAΔT/x</code>, where <code>k</code> is the thermal conductivity of the cooler, <code>A</code> is the area of the cooler through which thermal energy is flowing, <code>x</code> is the thickness of the cooler, and <code>ΔT</code> is the temperature difference between the inside and outside of the cooler (<code>T_out - T_in</code>). Notice that <em>all these are the same for both coolers</em>. Now, melting the ice requires energy of <code>Q = Lm</code> where <code>Q</code> is the total energy required, <code>L</code> is the (latent/specific) heat of fusion, and <code>m</code> is the mass of ice in the cooler. Since the total energy is <code>Q = Ht</code>, we can calculate the time required to melt all the ice: <code>Q = Ht = kAtΔT/x -&gt; t = Qx/(kAΔT) = Lmx/kAΔT</code>. Since all variables are the same for both coolers, it will take the exact same amount of time for the ice to melt.* </p>

<p>*: We are ignoring the air replacing the ice, which would actually give a (very) slight advantage to retaining water. Draining the water in that cooler requires adding heat - the excess heat of the air that replaces the melted water. Fortunately, that excess heat is fairly easy to calculate: <code>m = Vρ -&gt; V = m_ice/ρ_ice = m_air/ρ_air -&gt; m_air = m_ice * ρ_air/ρ_ice</code>. The air comes in with an excess energy of <code>Q = m_air*C_air*ΔT = m_ice*(ρ_air/ρ_ice)*C_air*ΔT</code>. This reduces the energy required from the cooler heat influx, reducing the time required: <code>Q = Lm_ice = Q_cooler + Q_air = kAtΔT/x + m_ice*(ρ_air/ρ_ice)*C_air*ΔT -&gt; t = (L/ΔT - ρ_air/ρ_ice)*C_air)mx/kA</code>. The fractional difference this will make ends up being about <code>4e-6*ΔT</code>, or about <code>0.016%</code> on a rather hot (40°C) day, coming to 2min 18s over 10 days. So we were right to ignore it.</p>

  <p>""Having 'duct tape', 'mole skin', or other adhesive products, and
  knowing how to apply them to prevent blisters in trouble spots.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have no idea of how to use/apply a duct-tape or a mole-skin.
Can anybody please elaborate how to do it? Also, what can go wrong if I do it incorrectly?</p>
","<p>Blisters are caused by friction. Your skin is not very slippery. Applying moleskin and duct-tape over a ""hot-spot"" adds a protective layer between your skin and shoe. Thus as your shoe slides, it rubs against the tape or mole-skin instead of your skin.</p>

<p>Pointers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use enough tape/mole-skin to cover an area larger than the hot-spot. If the hotspot is on the edge of your heel go ahead and wrap the tape up and around the side/bottom so it doesn't shift/move. (Duct tape, being cheaper than mole-skin is better for large area applications.)</li>
<li>Cut mole-skin in a circle (or at the very least, round the corners) to prevent the corners from catching on socks, shoes, etc and peeling off. (With duct-tape, I usually just snip the corners off, since it tends to stick better.)</li>
<li>Use <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tincture_of_benzoin"">tincture of benzoin</a> (a sticky substance) to help the moleskin adhere better to your foot.</li>
<li>If you just have a hot-spot, I find duct-tape works better since it is thinner, and provides a near-frictionless surface.</li>
<li>If you already have a blister, mole-skin / mole-foam (thicker) is better especially if you cut a hole in the center and stick a dough-nut of mole-skin around the blister. The added thickness helps keep your shoe from rubbing the blister in the middle</li>
</ul>

<p>Things to be aware of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Moleskin, being thicker, can take up space in tight-fitting shoes, and shift  the fit-problem / wear elsewhere.</li>
<li>Some areas (between toes) it might be better to wrap the rubbing toe than the rubbed toe (personal preference).</li>
<li>Using too SMALL of a piece of tape/other will result in it shifting, falling off, balling up, etc. In that case, just try to re-apply a larger piece.</li>

"How to clean rock-climbing shoes?","41121","","<p>I have never found a good answer to this one:</p>

<p><strong>How do you clean rock-climbing shoes, without ruining them?</strong></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HNwWl.jpg"" alt=""Funky Old Climbing Shoes""></p>

<p>Let me be more specific.</p>

<p>I have a pair of modern leather-and-fancy-rubber climbing shoes made by a major brand. They fit exactly the way I want and the rubber is still sound. But they reek like I exercise in them (with no socks) six days a week. How do I make these expensive slippers smell less horrifying without ruining the rubber or the leather?</p>
","<p>First, <strong>prevention</strong> is going to give you the best bang for your buck.  Make sure your shoes dry properly between uses by hanging them out, and not keeping them in a bag/trunk/confined space.  During your climbing session, it's a good idea to take your shoes off between climbs, or at least once in a while to let them dry out some.</p>

<p>For <strong>odor control</strong>, I find that spray deodorizers can do a good job.  I don't think I would use powders, but I'm curious what everyone else says.</p>

<p>Once things get <em>really</em> bad, you can give shoes a <strong>wash</strong> (by hand) using warm water, a mild detergent, and a brush of some sort (an old toothbrush works fine).  Wash the insides thoroughly using the brush and soap, it'll take a few rinses to get everything.  Allow the shoes to dry completely, put them next to a fan/heater (but not too close).  Stuff the shoes with newspaper, and change it often.</p>

<p>Generally, I find some brands to be worse for odors than others.  I've had good luck with La Sportiva, and a terrible time with Evolvs.  This is most likely because of the material (leather vs. synthetic).</p>

"What can I do to help relieve joint pain in fingers after climbing?","38210","","<p>After I've been climbing for a while, my finger joints are very sore.</p>

<p>Is there anything I can do to relieve that pain?</p>
","<p>This might sound a bit daft - but you could be holding on to the rock too tightly. Your other questions indicate you might be pretty new to climbing, and it is common for beginners to make this mistake.</p>

<p>Primarily, you should be climbing with your legs - pushing your weight up. Legs are used to your weight - arms, and fingertips, are not. If you are steady on your legs - especially if you are able to get your leg straight so you are standing through bone and not relying on a bent knee - then you should only need to use your hands for balancing yourself.</p>

<p>Obviously, there are times when you really do need to grip harder, and even pull yourself up rather than push, but climbing is as much a thinking game as it is physical, and planning your moves goes a long way to preventing fatigue and injury.</p>

<p>Treating joint pain - ice packs probably help. I'd also think about taking an anti-inflammatory, like ibuprofen or aspirin (not at the same time).</p>

","<p>The simplest ones are like this, and even the more complex ones are typically broadly similar.</p>

<p>Usage is to have set your peg at a useful distance (ie not too close to the tent, as it won't hold the pole/skin out, and not too far away as you might trip over it) and pop the loop round the peg.</p>

<p>Then just slide the tensioner up the guy rope until tight. </p>

<p>Remember to slightly overtighten if you expect rain, as nylon guy ropes stretch a fair bit in the wet.</p>

<p><strong>With the one you have, you already have the loop and the slot. Open up the loop and place this over your peg, then slide the black plastic piece up the rope until tight - the mechanism is the same, the friction is just applied a slightly different way.</strong></p>

"What are the different methods to purify water?","36916","","<p>What methods can I use to purify water? And what's the difference between those several methods (safety, duration needed, ...)?</p>
","<p><strong>Boiling-</strong> 185°F (85°C) water will become sterile in minutes.  Bringing the water up to boiling point will typically sterilize it.  At high altitude you may need to boil for a minute.</p>

<p><strong>Chemical-</strong> Iodine, chlorine, and other chemicals can sterilize water.  Follow directions on products specifically designed for this purpose.  Typically you'll need to mix it and then let it sit for some number of minutes.  Although chemicals are required, this method is often the most convenient as carrying a few pills is simple.  If chlorine scares you, consider that you have been drinking it your whole life in tap water.  Some battery operated systems work with salt and electrolysis, producing chlorine.  This is convenient as well due to the availability of salt.</p>

<p><strong>Distillation-</strong> This method works by distilling the water, usually in a solar still, to remove almost all impurities.</p>

<p><strong>UV Light-</strong> Battery powered SteriPens produce UV light and kill everything including viruses. This is similar to some of the best pool water treatment systems, is very convenient and may work in less than a minute, although pens are costly and you'll need fresh batteries.</p>

<p><strong>Filtration-</strong> As simple and quick as pumping the water through a filter.  Each filter is different, but typically they remove 99%+ of bacteria, but not viruses unless a chemical is contained in the filter. You'll need to replace parts periodically and keep the system clean, but overall its pretty convenient.</p>

<p><strong>Sunlight Pasteurization-</strong> Depending on the sunlight strength and outside temperature, you can leave a plastic bottle of water in sunlight for 6 hours+.  The heat and UV light will make water safe. The downside is that you need to look up or guess how long based on the conditions.</p>

<p><strong>Backwoods tricks-</strong> Survival techniques include many ways of obtaining water that is probably pure.  They include distillation techniques (covered pits with pots, etc), and careful rainwater and dew collection or extraction and filtration by plants or clothing.  None of these methods are convenient for daily use, and some are risky.</p>

<p>None of these methods necessarily protect against chemical contaminants, although some water filters are specifically designed to ""filter"" chlorine or other common chemicals.  I have heard skepticism regarding some of those claims.</p>

"What do I do if a black bear is right outside my tent?","36780","","<p>Even if I was to follow the advice of letting bears know I am in the area, keeping my cooking and anything that smells at least 100m from my camp &amp; downwind, etc, suppose a bear finds my tent and likes the smell of it. </p>

<p>What do I do? Suppose I do have a means of defending myself (maybe a canister of bear spray and/or a gun of some description)?</p>
","<p>I've been up close with grizzly and black bears before, I've had them come sniffing through my camp and I've done nothing but lay quiet in my sleeping bag and wait for them to wander off, which they usually do. Most of the time I don't even know they were there, I just find their tracks the next morning. </p>

<p>Believe it or not bears spook really easily. I've never had to use bear spray or shoot at a bear, they always run off as soon as we let them know we're getting close. So if you're in your tent and a bear is taking his time investigating your site, all you have to do most of the time is just announce yourself and that should be enough to scare them away. <strong>The human voice is the number one deterrent for bears</strong>, so just start making loud noises. </p>

<p>This will work most of the time, but the real problem bears are the ones that are used to humans, especially the ones that have been fed by humans in the past or found food in camps before, if one of these bears wanders into you site and doesn't act like it intends to leave without first finding something to eat, then get your bear spray out, get out of the tent, act big and keep shouting. You need to be pretty close for bear spray to be effective (30ft/9m or closer) so only spray it if your other attempts don't work and the bear is approaching you, or letting you approach him. Do NOT spray it inside of your tent, you will immediately regret it and possibly do yourself some serious harm. Try to get <em>upwind</em> of the bear if possible, and aim for his nose. One good blast and that bear should take off real quick.</p>

<p>Most people only cary one or the other, bear spray or a gun. A warning shot from a gun does just as good as bear spray does. People around here (Canadian Rockies) that hike with shotguns load it with 3 different types of ammo; the first round is just bird shot, to shoot in the air as a warning shot; the second shot is a slug, to shoot past the bear so he can hear the ball whistling past him; the rest of your rounds are all hollow-point bear stoppers, to put the beast down, because if the first two shots don't scare him away then nothing else is going to stop him.</p>

<p>Hunters have bigger problems with bears than campers do, because hunters typically have a fresh kill with them that the bear wants (usually grizzly bears), with campers and hikers, it's usually a case of the hikers sneaking up on the bear unintentionally and surprising it-in which case the bear acts defensively- or bears happening upon a campsite because it's on the side of a trail (bears use trails too) and finding food there.</p>

<p>Shotguns are only necessary if the bear charges, tries to get into your tent, or is following you and you can't shake them off your trial. This is especially true with black bears, if a black bear is following you, and isn't scared off by any of your attempts to get him to leave, then odds are good you're going to have to either fight it off or shoot it, because there have been incidents where black bears have been known to stalk people for food. These incidents are very rare, and will typically only occur in the most wild areas where bears don't have much contact with humans.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... suppose a bear finds my tent and likes the smell of warm man-flesh
  inside of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Coming from bear country, if shouting at it doesn't scare it away and you have a gun, ten out of ten people where I'm from would say <strong>shoot it</strong>. Right through the tent. Don't even feel guilty about it, because if you don't shoot it, then a ranger probably will as soon as you report the encounter (assuming you managed to scare it off some other way). They don't tolerate bears that behave that way because they're  a risk to people's safety. You've probably heard the saying, <strong>""A fed bear is a dead bear.""</strong> They say that because 99% of the time, bears that get hand outs or find
 human food end up getting put down because they always come back for more.  </p>

<p>If you have a bear trying to get in your tent, and you <em>don't</em> have a gun: <strong>FIGHT IT</strong>. You are literally fighting for your life, so kick, scream, hit it in the face with anything you've got. Bear spray will only work if there's nothing in between you and the bear, so try to get out of your tent before trying to spray it, or like I said already, you can actually make things worse for yourself if you spray it inside of your tent.</p>

<p>How important is the ""seasonality"" of a tent? In my understanding, a tent protects against wind and precipitation, which occur in any season; a sleeping bag protects against the cold. Then why are tents sorted by seasons? What does a 5-season tent have that a 4-season tent does not, how does this differ from a 3-season tent, etc.? And what is the 5th season?</p>
","<p>I hadn't seen any of these but a quick Google does indeed seem to bring up a few!</p>

<p>From a quick glance around, though this isn't an authoritative answer, it seems that 5 season tents are specifically designed for the harshness of Arctic-like climates, rather than a 4 season tent being designed more for your average winter in non-arctic conditions. I guess in this sense the 5th season would be the ""uber-harsh"" winter, and therefore 5th season tents (I would guess) could stand heavier winds and snowfalls.</p>

<p>However, the seasons of a tent generally can be important. No, it doesn't protect you from the cold directly but depending on conditions a tent needs to be able to stand up to wind, rain, snow, ice, hail, etc.</p>

<p>As a general guide:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A 2 season tent will likely only be designed for camping in relatively good weather in the sunnier parts of the year. It'll cope with mild rain and wind, but anything really heavy could push it beyond its design. It may have permanent ventilation flaps you can't close to keep you cool that will let wind through but stop mild rain.</p></li>
<li><p>A 3 season tent will be able to stand up to heavier rain and winds, and hence while it'll often have ventilation flaps you'll often be able to close them on a 3 season tent to stop heavier rain and winds driving though. It'll also probably have more / stronger guy ropes, and the material may be stronger too.</p></li>
<li><p>A 4 season tent will be designed for use in winter / snowy climates - so as well as the above will be able to survive snow being driven at the tent, heavy constant winds, etc. Ventilation flaps probably won't be a feature - otherwise even when closed, fine snow could blow into the tent. This will often be replaced with a panel at the top of the inside tent that can be opened to provide some ventilation in warmer climates; but the main purpose of the tent is to protect against harsh elements rather than provide features for warmer climates.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You can see by the general logic why I'd expect a 5 season tent to be an extension of a 4th. Generally, while higher season tents are more durable, they're also more expensive and often heavier - so it's not an all out constant advantage. A 4 season tent in sunny climates would probably be rather uncomfortable without ventilation too!</p>

<li>Under-tent conditions - look for dry ground to camp on, avoid thick vegetation that may be a source of water vapour.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other tips:</p>

<ul>
<li>Consider an elevated camp position, the bottom of a valley may become colder at night increasing condensation. There may also be more of a breeze to help ventilate your tent.</li>
<li>Pitch your tent such that the vents are aligned with the prevalent wind to maximise air flow through your tent. Obviously in high winds you should still pitch you tent to minimise the chance of it being damaged or blowing away.</li>
<li>If weather and biting insects allow, keep the tent door open to maximise ventilation.</li>
<li>Single walled tents, while small and light, are less effective in humid conditions. If you are using such a tent, make sure it is designed to be easily ventilated.</li>

"What's the UPF of a T-Shirt or jeans?","34495","","<p>Many outdoor clothing items advertise themselves with a UPF (Ultraviolet protection factor) of 30 or even 50. How does that compare with a normal cotton T-Shirt or a pair of jeans? Do I have to use sunscreen even when using these clothes? Or is it all a marketing scam?</p>
","<p>The short answer is, <strong>it varies</strong>.  The three factors that most influence the UV transmission factor of clothing are kind of obvious:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Material</strong>: Some materials are better at absorbing UV than others; for example, the paper cited below suggests that polyester absorbs more UV light (particularly UVB) than cotton.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Weave</strong>: The thicker and more tightly woven a piece of fabric is, the less light it lets through.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Color</strong>: Dyes work by absorbing various frequencies of visible light, and many of them will absorb UV too.  Of course, high light absorption at visible frequencies doesn't necessarily imply high UV absorption, but as a general rule of thumb, white or lightly colored fabrics do tend to let more UV through than darker fabrics.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, there are also ""invisible dyes"" that can absorb UV without darkening the visible color of the fabric.  Some UV-absorbent laundry additives are sold specifically for that purpose, but many laundry detergents also contain fluorescent compounds called optical brighteners that absorb some UV light and re-emit it in the visible spectrum.  Also, getting the fabric wet will change its UV transmittance, typically increasing it.</p>

<p>For some numerical values, I did a quick search on Google Scholar and found a paper titled <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-4362.1997.00046.x/abstract"">""Clothing as protection from ultraviolet radiation: which fabric is most effective?""</a> by     Sandra Davis, Linda Capjack, Nancy Kerrand Robert Fedosejcvs, published in 1997 in the <em>International Journal of Dermatology</em> 36(5).  Alas, the on-line version of the paper is behind a paywall, but I'll quote a few relevant sample SPF values from their table 3 below, courtesy of my university library's on-line subscription:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lightweight cotton jersey knit, typical of T-shirt fabrics: <strong>SPF 4</strong> (white) / <strong>18</strong> (dyed blue).</li>
<li>Heavy cotton twill weave, similar to 8 oz. denim: <strong>SPF 12</strong> (white) / <strong>166</strong> (dyed blue).</li>
</ul>

<p>The measured SPF value of 166 for blue denim is basically off the scale: for practical purposes, blue jeans don't let any UV through at all.  The relatively low SPF of the white cotton twill is a bit surprising, though, and indeed is what prompted the authors to test the effects of the blue dye:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""The low SPF of 13 [in table 1] for the white cotton twill (jean fabric) was surprising, as previous researchers recommended denim as suitable protection for many sun-sensitive patients. In a pre-test, a sample of blue denim taken from a pair of jeans was tested in the same manner as the above samples and produced a high SPF value. Since the white twill differs only in color from most denim, the indigo dye in blue denim might be an important UV absorber. [...] Dyeing the fabrics dark blue increased the SPF by more than a factor of three for all cotton fabrics.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Still, even an SPF of 12 is nothing to sneer at, particularly since the SPF values for clothing are not subject to the same kind of inflation as those marketed for dermal sunscreens (which are typically only valid if the product is applied thickly and frequently reapplied).  You might be able to tan a little bit under white jeans if you spend a <em>lot</em> of time in sunlight, but probably not so you'd notice.  The SPF 4 measured for the white T-shirt fabric is pretty low, though: it's a lot better than nothing, but it might not be enough to prevent sunburn if you spend a lot of time outdoors.</p>

<p>However, this study did not cover the effects of laundry additives; for that, we can look at <a href=""http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&amp;context=textiles_facpub"">""Improving Knit Fabric UPF Using Consumer Laundry Products: A Comparison of Results Using Two Instruments""</a> by Jihyun Kim, Janis Stone, Patricia Crews, Mack Shelley II and Kathryn L. Hatch from 2004.</p>

<p>In this study, the authors tested the effects of two off-the-shelf laundry detergents containing optical brighteners, one laundry additive sold as an optical brightener and one sold as a UV-absorber.  While their numerical values don't seem directly comparable, they do report a more than 3-fold increase in SPF for all the products, comparable to the effects of the blue dye in the Davis <em>et al.</em> study, although, for the detergents, the full effect was only achieved after the cloth had been washed over a dozen times.</p>

<p>So my rough, unscientific conclusion from all this would be that, if you're planning to wear jeans and a white T-shirt while hiking in the mountains or sailing, you should either buy a special UV-protective T-shirt, wash your normal T-shirt with a UV-absorbent laundry additive, or just apply sunscreen under it.  But you don't need to worry about the jeans &mdash; there's no way you'll get sunburn under those.</p>

What are the best methods to prevent them finding you interesting in the first place? And what will stop them finding your skin if they do take an interest?</p>

<li>You can spray your socks/shoes with some type of deet spray or some tobacco water (soak some tobacco leaves in water).</li>

"Is it warmer to sleep naked in a sleeping bag?","33174","","<p>When camping in cold weather, some people say it is actually warmer to sleep naked than to sleep with clothes on.</p>

<p>Is that true, or is it better to leave warm clothes on while in the bag?</p>
","<p>When talking about fresh, dry clothes then it's not true. More layers definitely equals warmer!</p>

<p>As pointed out in the comments if you <em>really</em> go to extremes then more layers doesn't necessarily equal warmer, but to get to that point you have to really cram yourself in the bag so there's no insulating air between the layers. You could also make yourself so warm you sweat which would make your clothes damp and cool you down again, but if you just wear warm enough clothes to be comfortable, not sweltering (which is surely what you want anyway!) then you shouldn't have an issue.</p>

<p>Where this saying may come into effect (I've heard it branded around before as well) is when you wear clothes to bed that you've already been wearing so they may be damp, or clothes that are next to damp clothes in your rucksack (somewhat surprisingly regular for the more novice hikers!) and so on with similar situations. In those cases, it's probably best to sleep without than put on damp clothes.</p>

<p>Yes, in certain contrived / specialised / odd cases this may be true. But on all practical levels my experiences, and the experiences of those I know suggest that it's a myth with dry clothes and only comes into play with damp clothes, which most seasoned campers (and many other people too) know tend to easily cool you down anyway!</p>

<p>Keeping a low center of gravity can reduce probability of injury by reducing how far you fall.  Positioning yourself so that if you do fall, a softer part of your body (like your rear end as opposed to wrist or eye) hits the ground first can also help cushion the fall and reduce the chance of injury.  </p>

<p>You can also visually scan the ground for areas that might be rougher (not reflect light as smoothly) or have packed snow instead of ice.  In urban environments, walking along packed snow next to a sidewalk may be safer than walking on an icy sidewalk.  When things start to melt, watch out for and try to avoid places where there's a thin layer of water on top of smooth ice; the fluid can act as a lubricant and reduce friction.  </p>

<p>In particularly slippery conditions, especially downhill, you can ""walk"" with your rear low to the ground and your arms down with palms out just above the ground, and your eyes scanning for rougher areas and/or things you can grab onto if you fall / start sliding.</p>

","<p>I know very about kitesurfing, so I did some research on it. Please look at some of the resources I used instead of taking what I say for granted. I hope that I can provide a simple baseline, and those who know more or want to know more can continue the process.</p>

<p>Most of the information below is summarized, paraphrased, or quoted from this site:
<a href=""http://www.kitesurfingschool.org"">www.kitesurfingschool.org</a></p>

<p>They deserve most of the credit for it - I just condensed this particular info.</p>

<p><strong>Wind Direction:</strong></p>

<p>It is possible to go nearly any direction regardless of the wind direction, though moving upwind is more challenging than downwind, and beginners in particular will have trouble with it.</p>

<p>To keep things simple, there is a ""wind window"" where the wind allows a kite to fly in. When facing downwind, the window is roughly 85 degrees to left and right, and 85 degrees upward.</p>

<p>Ideally, surf in winds that are parallel to the shore, or in winds that go towards the shore at a 45 degree angle (called ""side-onshore wind"")</p>

<p>Onshore winds (where the wind is headed directly from the sea onto shore) are not desirable, because it might blow you directly on land, which would be dangerous.</p>

<p>On the same lines, offshore winds (where the wind is blowing out to sea) are also not desirable (even dangerous) because it is easier to be blown out to sea if you lose control or if the equipment fails.</p>

<p><strong>Wind Speed:</strong></p>

<p>For a beginner, you should train on the beach (not in water) at wind speeds around 7-20 knots (~23 mph) with a trainer kite (or 7-10 knots [~8-12 mph] with a normal small kite). </p>

<p>When you've trained further and practiced, the wind speed and direction is somewhat less important, as long as it is roughly between 10 and 30 knots (~12-35 mph), and your equipment matches the conditions.</p>

<p>Wind speed should not gust very much. More than 8 MPH gusts are challenging to manage. (From <a href=""http://www.mackiteboarding.com"">www.mackiteboarding.com</a>)</p>

<p><em>Low Speeds:</em></p>

<p>It is possible to kitesurf in wind as low as 5 knots, though you need to take advantage of that low wind with the right size of board and kite (large board, large kite, long lines). Kitesurfing School calls wind from 5-10 knots ""extreme light wind kitesurfing.""</p>

<p>They also include a table of ""minimum wind speed (in knots) needed to fly decently:""</p>

<ul>
<li>Inflatable Kites: 5 knots</li>
<li>Flat Inflatable: 4-5 knots</li>
<li>Arc Kite: 4-5 knots</li>
<li>Closed Cell Foil: 4-5 knots</li>
<li>Opened Cell Foil: 3 knots</li>
</ul>

<p><em>High Speeds:</em></p>

<p>Kitesurfing at wind speeds above 30 knots is very dangerous, so keep in mind some rules:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use kite size appropriate for the condition. When in doubt, try your smallest kite first.</li>
<li>Use shorter line to restrict the power zone and the time the kite stays in the power zone. Start from 20m and go down or up as appropriate.</li>
<li>Launch and land unhooked (unless you use the flat LEI kite or bow kite).</li>
<li>Ride unhooked when you are near hard objects (unless you use the flat LEI kite or bow kite).</li>
<li>Wear a helmet.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Surf Conditions</strong> (mostly from www.mackiteboarding.com/kiteboarding-conditions.htm):</p>

<p>High winds equal larger, choppier waves, which are harder to surf. Beginners will want waves that are under 2-3 feet tall. At the higher end of speeds, waves might get up above 3 meters - big!</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>

<p>Ideal wind speed is 10-25 knots, direction is headed onshore at a 45 degree angle (or parallel to the shore), and surf is relatively calm.</p>

"My head torch/lamp has a red mode, why?","28261","","<p>My new head torch has a mode that produces a red light. I've seen this several times and I have no idea when our why you would use it?</p>
","<h2>Red light preserves your night vision.</h2>

<p>Red lights are used in photography dark rooms, military bunkers, submarines, and anywhere you might find yourself working in the dark. It gives you light to see by, while at the same time keeping your eyes adjusted for the dark.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qXruX.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I use my red light mostly when I'm when I'm around a camp fire, in the middle of the night when I'm in my tent, or when I have to go out to do my business in the pitch black. It's also excellent to use when there's a bright moon.</p>

<p>Using your red light in the tent is great because you won't blast your eyes out, or disturb anyone else in the tent, your eyes don't need to adjust to it like they need to adjust to white light. This is exactly why digital alarm clocks have red numbers. @Olin explains some of the science in <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/8082/my-head-torch-lamp-has-a-red-mode-why/#answer-8084"">his answer</a>, and @radpin's comment to the OP links to <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/2075/does-red-light-preserve-your-night-vision"">this question</a> on biology.SE.</p>

<p>Using your red light outdoors in the dark gives you much more peripheral vision. When you're using your white light; your eyes adjust to the light so you can only see what's being illuminated by your headlamp. When your eyes are adjusted to the dark, you can use the red light to illuminate the trail, but you will also be able to see everything that's being illuminated by the moon in the distance. </p>

<p>Try it out next time you're in the dark, give your eyes enough time to adjust to the dark, then turn on your red light. You'll be surprised how much you can actually see.</p>

"Is it better to wear one pair or two pairs of socks while hiking?","28196","","<p>From personal experience I tend to wear two pairs of socks, normally some running socks and then my hiking socks on top of that. It helps me avoid blisters. Quite a few of my friends thinks this is nonsense. But with well worn-in boots I always tend to get more blisters if I wear only one pair. Does anyone know if there is any <strong>scientific reason</strong> for this? or is it just an old wives tale? </p>
","<p>Hiking blisters are from friction.  When things shift, your sock is more likely to stay with your boot than your foot as the two fabrics (or leather and fabric) will catch each other.  This leaves the sock moving against your foot, which causes friction.  When you wear two socks, specifically a smooth liner and a wool hiking sock, the outer sock moves against the inner sock instead of against your foot and less friction is created.  Less friction = fewer blisters. </p>

<p>For the same reason, two pairs of wool won't work as well as what you currently do because the wool is likely to bind and behave like one sock instead of two</p>

"Why go without socks with climbing shoes?","28032","","<p>I've been going climbing (indoor bouldering) for about six months, using shoes I rented at the gym, and wearing socks (and everything was fine). I've recently got a pair of climbing shoes, and want to know why some people wear them without socks. What are the benefits of socks vs. without? Is this purely a matter of taste?</p>
","<p>I am not sure about the being able to feel more, but the most important reason I don't use socks is to avoid the rock boot sliding on my foot. </p>

<p>If you are on a marginal grip using just the edge of your sole, you don't want the boot to move at all. </p>

<p>This is also one of the reasons that rock boots for more experienced climbers are much more rigid than those for beginners - so you know that when you touch the rock, the rubber will grip and not bend.</p>

","<p>Generally speaking wildlife should not be harassed by humans, but left alone. Bites can infect you with unwanted bacteria and require stitches in a hospital.</p>

<p>Large animals should always be left alone because they could be possibly cause people harm. Amongst this group are kangaroos which are to be considered a real possible danger to people, especially if cornered or somehow feel threatened.</p>

<p>Their hind legs can disembowel opponents such as other kangaroos or other animals so they should be considered dangerous to people on foot, especially if they are approaching the animal too closely or scare it by accident.</p>

<p>People should not approach kangaroos on foot but stay away from them as for the same of other large wildlife. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Male kangaroos ""box"", either in play, when asserting their dominance or in serious competition over females. The punching of the front legs is pretty harmless, but the powerful hind legs with their long sharp toenails are a dangerous weapon. <strong>Kangaroos can disembowel opponents</strong>, be it other kangaroos or predators like dogs.- <a href=""http://www.outback-australia-travel-secrets.com/kangaroo-facts.html"">Kangaroo Facts</a></p>

"How to create campfire which will burn overnight?","27737","","<p>I watched a documentary ""Man vs Wild"" which showed the TV presenter Bear Grylls collecting wood and starting a fire. He somehow always manages to keep his campfire burning until dawn. How does one know how much wood to collect such that it is adequate to last throughout the night? Is there a certain method of arranging the wood pile consisting of broken branches and twigs to maximize the period of combustion?</p>
","<p>It's difficult to tell exactly how long wood you've gathered will last you, unless as an expert you can gauge an accurate estimate due to the type of wood, weather conditions and other contributing factors (theoretically possible, but above my ability level.)</p>

<p>However, there are different ways of constructing a fire, and one in particular is designed to burn for long periods, such as overnight, without requiring any maintenance or fiddling about through the night (if done correctly.)</p>

<p>This is known as a <strong>pyramid fire</strong>:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HWnWx.png"" alt=""Diagram of pyramid fire""></p>

<p>You place two logs parallel on the ground to start with, then place a row of smaller logs perpendicular and on top of the original two, then another row perpendicular and on top of that row, and so on. You then light the fire at the top, and instinctively quite bizarrely the fire will then burn downwards (as each level becomes hot enough to ignite the layer below it.)</p>

"Does hiking with a dog in bear country increase or decrease your risk of a bear encounter?","27034","","<p>I've heard various rumors that dogs might help keep bears away, or might be a bear attractant. Is there anything more concrete than anecdotal evidence to go on?</p>

<p>From the companionship end, they are a net positive, helping to calm your nerves when you hear a strange noise (though it can be disturbing when they start growling at some unseen / unheard shadow in the night).</p>
","<p>Keep your dog on a leash.</p>

<p>According the the <a href=""http://usscouts.org/safety/safe-bear.asp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Scouts</a>, dogs are a bad idea in bear country.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Leave your dog at home. A dog often infuriates a bear and may come
  running back to you with the bear in pursuit!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>New Hampshire <a href=""http://www.wildlife.state.nh.us/Wildlife/faqs_black_bears.htm#dog"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">department of wildlife</a> agrees that, while small, the primary risk is that your dog agitates a bear then runs to you for protection with the bear in pursuit.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.nps.gov/dena/frequently-asked-questions-regarding-bears.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Denali National Park</a>, with similar advice</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dogs can sometimes keep bears away from a camp, but very often, a dog initially chases a bear and then the bear chases the dog right back to the camp. Dogs may also harass a bear unnecessarily or pique a bear's curiosity. Dogs must be kept on a leash while in the park and are not allowed on trails, in the backcountry, or left unattended at any time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are more than a few bear attacks where a bear has attacked a person after chasing a dog to that person, even in suburban neighborhoods.  So this is not ""well it's not likely but just in case advice"".  Conversely there are virtually no reports of dogs saving their owners from bears.  Usually it's the owner having to save the dog.</p>

<p>It's very clear that a free running dog in bear country will increase your risk of hostile bear encounters.</p>

"Climbing rope is rated to X UIAA falls. What is a UIAA fall?","26925","","<p>When looking at buying climbing ropes, they are rated to a number of ""UIAA falls"".</p>

<p>What does that mean? </p>
","<p>Although I am not a lab technician it is important to understand the dynamics at play in these tests. Below is the best example I have read on the subject.</p>

<p>For the full article please read below.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.theuiaa.org/upload_area/UIAA/Commissions%20and%20Working%20Groups/Safety/Core%20documents/Research%20and%20Advice/sdarticle.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Behaviour of Rope Under Stretching During Fall - Authors: Vittorio Bedogni (CAI), Andrea Manes</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Internationale_des_Associations_d%27Alpinisme"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">UIAA Wikipedia</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Also included is the section on ""impact force"", which is a factor of the fall height, weight of the climber, amount of rope ""out"" at time of fall, and rope stretch. It is important to know as it can directly effect your safety.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Fall Test Overview</h2>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li><p>Fall Rating <strong>Half ropes</strong> have to pass a minimum of 5 controlled leader simulated falls. These falls are factor 1.77 falls so they are tested to close to the maximum fall that a climber can take (a factor 2). For those interested, a 55kg weight is dropped from a height of 2.30m above a preclipped karabiner. The amount of rope extending to the simulated belayer from the karabiner is only 30cm so that the set-up looks like the image on the left.</p></li>
  <li><p>The weight is dropped with a 5 minute rest in between tests. The diagram on the side is a little out of date though as the test has now been modified so that the rope passes over a 0.75mm metal edge instead of through a karabiner. 3 sample ropes are tested and the weakest one of the three becomes the fall rating. The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Internationale_des_Associations_d%27Alpinisme"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">UIAA</a> (Union Internationale des Associations d'Alpinisme) has a minimum fall rating of 5. 
  It should be noted though that a factor fall of 1.77 is very high and chances are that you will never even have such a high factor fall all your life. So do not interpret this rating as the maximum amount of times you can fall on a rope before you have to chuck it. Also remember that taking huge whippers do not necessarily induce large fall factors (it is often the exact opposite) so don't just think that because you have taken 3 whippers on your rope that you should be starting to think about retiring it. For more information about fall factors you can click here
  Obviously, though, you will be looking for a rope that has a high fall rating as, in theory, it will last you longer. Theoretically thicker ropes will have a higher fall rating than thinner ropes, as you would expect.</p></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/G7ite.png"" alt=""UIAA Fall Test""></p>

<h2>Impact Force</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The impact force measurement is the resulting force that is transferred onto the end of the rope- i.e. you. If you look at the diagram above again, you can see that the peak force generated by the 1.77 factor fall can be no more than 8Kn for a half rope. Basically the lower this figure is the better, not only because it reduces the force on you but also because it will reduce the force on the top runner- i.e. the lower the number the more force the rope absorbs. The flip side of this is that the rope will invariably have to stretch more to absorb more force. Now whilst this might not sound like a bad thing it can be. Situations can arise where you want the least amount of stretch in the rope- e.g. falling close to the ground, when top roping, etc. This is a point that is worth thinking about. If you are used to sport routes then you aren't going to be worried about minimizing the force on your top runner as it’s a bolt, and in addition the more the rope stretches the more you are going to have to climb back up if you fall. On the other hand if you climb a lot on badly protected terrain then the extra stretch may not be a worry if it helps keep the top runner from ripping out.</p>

"Should you pop a blister?","26651","","<p>When I'm home running or on a day hike, I prefer to pierce the skin as soon as a blister forms and drain all fluid from a blister to reduce the pain and further irritation/inflammation. In this case, I know I can get antibacterials and a thorough wash to ward off infection as well as stronger measures if the blister does become infected.</p>

<p>Of course hiking with a tube of neosporin and some tape, moleskin, whatever you prefer is ideal, but I'm wondering what people feel is best for blister care when you are going to keep walking for a few days or more when you discover a nice blister has already formed. </p>

<p>Is there guidance on ""pop it now"" versus ""let it pop itself"" for friction blisters?</p>
","<p>There's a lot of dubious assertions in the answers here, and frankly some bad advice regarding how long to wait before treating a blister. We just had a lecture on blister management in my WFR class yesterday, so I'll give this a go. </p>

<p>The answer to ""should I deflate this blister"" comes down to a very simple question: Will it pop itself if I don't? Any blister on the foot is likely going to pop itself if you don't. Blisters in other locations (typically the hands) may be less likely to. </p>

<ul>
<li>It's always preferable to deflate a blister under (relatively) clean and controlled conditions, rather than let it pop itself.</li>
<li>A blister that pops itself is more likely to get infected, and more likely to spread pus around and infect other areas. </li>
<li>An untreated blister or hotspot <em>will</em> grow larger. </li>
</ul>

<p>It's important to understand why blisters form. Friction causes heat to build up in an area, and the body creates a blister to protect the underlying skin from this excessive heat. If you don't reduce the friction, the blister will worsen. </p>

<p>The first thing you want to do is treat any hotspot before it becomes a blister. When a blister first starts to form, before it is pus-filled, is the optimal time to treat it. Clean and dry the area, then cover it in athletic tape. When possible, wrap the tape all the way around whatever body part is blistered, so the tape adheres to itself and you aren't just relying on the tape sticking to sweaty skin. The tape is there both to cover the hotspot, and also to provide a lower-friction surface to prevent further damage from occurring. You should also readjust your footwear/gloves if possible to reduce that friction. </p>

<p>If a blister does form, <strong>time is of the essence</strong>. The long you wait, the larger the blister will grow, because that heat is still being applied. This is why you should <em>not</em> wait until they end of the day to treat your blisters &ndash; treat all blisters ASAP! If the blister is relatively small and in an area where you can simply stop causing friction, then you don't need to deflate it. This is likely only going to be practical for some hand blisters; foot blisters usually need to be popped. </p>

<p>To pop the blister: </p>

<ul>
<li>Wash your hands first.</li>
<li>Wash the area on and around the blister with soap/water, iodine solution, or rubbing alcohol, and allow to dry. This will reduce the likelihood of introducing bacteria. </li>
<li>Sterilize a needle, safety pin, or similar object over an open flame; or, use a packaged sterile needle if you have one available.</li>
<li>Stab the base of the blister in a couple places, then <em>gently</em> press to deflate. Be mindful of where the pus drains to. </li>
<li>Leave the skin in place. </li>
<li>If you have moleskin, 2nd skin, etc. make a donut-shaped cutout to encircle the blister but not cover it.</li>
<li>Fill the donut hole with 2nd skin, antibiotic ointment, etc. if available. A bit of sterile gauze with iodine on it is an acceptable alternative. This is mostly to prevent infection and cover the blister site. </li>
<li>Cover the entire area with medical tape. Consider what motion was causing the blister to form, and try to apply the tape in such a way that the motion will not strip it off. When possible, wrap the tape around whatever body part the blister is on, so the tape can stick to itself and not just the skin. </li>
<li><strong>Inspect the blister at <em>least</em> every 6 hours!</strong> If you don't inspect the blister and replace the dressing, it may get worse without you noticing. Leave the donut in place, but replace the dressing in the donut hole and the surrounding tape. </li>

"How to keep my legs warm in winter?","26644","","<p>Winter is coming!</p>

<p>Very quickly in Belgium actually, much faster than I'm used to. It's also the first year where I spend a lot of time outside. Soon, that could be a lot of time outside... freezing.</p>

<p>I have plenty of layers to keep my upper body toasty. But I'm still shivering because my legs are way too cold in that jeans.</p>

<p>My plan is to spend the full day outside, or an evening after work, far from any building where I could re-heat myself. Most probably in the forest, and likely to be in a cold/dry or cold/snowy weather. I'd avoid rain, although it can still happen above zero degrees. I'd be partly on the move, partly static to look at stuff and smile, or cook food with my gas burner. I might even spend a night out, at some point, but that's not my priority.</p>

<p>I realise that's a lot of options. Let's make this the priority:</p>

<ul>
<li>cold and snowy (between 5 and -10 degrees celsius)</li>
<li>full day outside</li>
<li>move half the time, stand the other half, with the occasional cooking.</li>
</ul>

<p>Is there anything I could wear (which hopefully looks OK to be in a city with it) that will prevent my legs from freezing me to death?</p>
","<p>One thing you can look into are long-legged thermal underwear - this wouldn't effect how you look on the outside as they go under your clothes and create an insulating layer to help keep you warm. Women can get away with this in everyday life with a nice pair of tights. So for city life, as you stated, this should mean no difference in your every day appearance.</p>

<p>You have mentioned keeping your core warm, and that's great - as your core is warmer the blood that flows from your torso will be warmer, helping to warm your legs, arms and extremities. This is relative but I often find I feel better in general with a nice toasty torso, even if it's just a placebo effect. </p>

<p>Another option that's useful for women (sorry guys, you might not be able to pull this off!) is knee length fur / wool lined boots - this is something I tend to do all winter, when not actually hiking. When hiking and wearing my ankle length hiking boots I'll often wear a long pair of socks under my trousers, and my thick walking socks over these (with my trousers sexily tucked in!) - but again this is mimicking the effect of thermal undies, just up to my calf.</p>

<p>Thermal long legged underwear would do the job.</p>

<p>A quick Google search give you all the info you need:  </p>

<p>Many grasses are edible, in the sense that you can eat it; you simply won't get any energy/nutrients out of it. They consist mostly of cellulose, and our digestive tract is simply not made to break that down (as opposed to, e.g. cows, which employ four stomachs for that purpose). There are however also grasses that are toxic. So when not discerning between actual species, the effect of eating grasses is somewhere between no effect and harmful.</p>

<p>The big wooden things with the curl at the front (toboggans, though some people use the word for any kind of sled) are best for piling 5 or 6 people onto and then all falling off in a tangled heap when you try to turn a corner of any kind. While this is fun, it's offset by the hassle of dragging such a heavy thing back up the hill. </p>

<p>The multipart constructions with seats, turnable skis, etc are similarly a pain to carry back up. I haven't tried the foam boards yet, but they look expensive and I'm not sure what the benefit is.</p>

<p>My suggestion: go to a Canadian Tire (or your local equivalent) and buy a selection of cheap lightweight plastic things: a disc, a rectangle that looks like two kids could sit in it, a carpet, etc (and if there are several of you then get several styles of rectangle) - spend about $30-$40 per person and then throw all that at a hill and find out what you like. If you're on a public hill, you can always give your ""rejected"" sleds to random other hill-visitors, who often show up in a group that has more people than sleds.</p>

","<p>Normal detergent should be able to break down the poisonous oils in question, it shouldn't require any specialist stuff to remove them. Just be sure of a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wash infected clothes separate from ""clean"" (i.e. unaffected) ones to eliminate any possible risk of spreading</li>
<li>Make especially sure you don't overload the machine - leave plenty of room so the detergent can soak the clothes easily. If it's packed full then parts may be left unwashed, or not washed effectively as they could have been.</li>

<p>I understand this depends on a lot of variables, such as the person's fitness, the route they are planning to do, etc, but some approximate numbers would be helpful.</p>

<p>In my specific case, we're both very active. We've been weight training in the gym for the last 6 and 11 years respectively - and it shows.</p>

<p>Our plan is to hike during June this year, <strong>so we have time to train</strong>. Is it realistic to think we could do <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumbria_Way"">Cumbria Way in The Lake District</a>, or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Highland_Way"">West Highland Way in Scotland</a>?</p>
","<p>Start by day hikes where you can frequently exit. For example, find a day hike where after 2 hours, one has the option either to cut it short to a 2½ hour hike in total, or to extend it to 4 hours, and after 4 hours, one has again the option to cut it to 4½ hours, or to make it 6 hours.</p>

<p>If you've done this for several days and find out that 6 hour day hikes are fine for you, you can start doing hikes reaching more remote places where you <em>don't</em> have such an ""exit strategy"". Make such hikes for several days.</p>

<p>If this goes fine too, you can start planning multi-day hikes. Again, start easily: do hikes where you have an exit strategy. Hike from cabin to cabin, where one can decide each day to stop the next day, or to continue for at least one more day. </p>

<p>In summary, when unexperienced, I recommend to build flexibility into your planning. Some unexperienced hikers have no problem hiking a week on stretch. Others find within 2 hours that they have had enough for the day. The only way to find out is to try it out; take it easy, and have an exit strategy.</p>

"FiveFingers or hiking boots?","25053","","<p>I have been wearing Vibram FiveFingers exclusively for three years now. I day hike in them, I exercise in them, I go to to work with them, I hit the beach and swim in them. I have tried wearing ""regular"" shoes now and again and they cause me pain. So the first thought that came to mind when my wife said let's go hike Scotland was cool I'll buy a new pair of TrekSports for the trip. Then I started to worry that maybe I should buy a pair of hiking boots. I have never gone on a multi-day hiking trip, 4-6 miles a day at 3000' elevation change.  I googled a solution but I couldn't find anything definitive. I am heading to Scotland in August. </p>

<p>Should I hedge my bets and buy a pair of hiking boots ""just in case"", or do you think I would do fine with a couple of pairs of FiveFingers? Any opinions or links to where I can get more information would be appreciated. I am really looking for someone that has gone on a multi-day 60 mile or so hike, with their FiveFingers, that can pass along a little advice.</p>
","<p>I would say the answer is somewhat subjective, and in order to make a fair assessment you will need to invest some time. Carrying a 30-pound pack up and down hills with a week's worth of food and gear produces different stresses on your feet and joints than a water bottle and rain jacket. The fit may seem less perfect if the material between your toes starts to dig in when descending a steep slope. Of course, being so accustomed to the VFFs, it might take you an even longer time to break in new hiking boots and get conditioned in them.</p>

<p>Personally, while I might wear my VFFs or sandals on a short day hike, I am skeptical they would be sufficient on a serious multi-day trip. That is no indictment of Vibram the company or the FiveFingers as a product; for many of the same reasons I would not attempt a mountain hike in Tevas, for example. The reasons include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Traction - FiveFingers generally have rather thin soles. In slippery conditions (streambeds, mossy rocks, any kind of wet), having a deeper tread as on a traditional boot will provide better traction and stability. </p></li>
<li><p>Trail obstacles - Any natural trail has some rough patches. VFFs are thin and provide minimal toe protection. Even when trail running in FiveFingers, I can definitely feel pebbles on the path dig into my sole, and remember every branch I stub into. I've also encountered thorny branches underfoot that pierced their side (though not the sole). Remember, you will be weighed down with gear for 4-6 days' travel, not just your day pack, so your footfalls will be much higher impact.</p></li>
<li><p>Cold - VFFs are not designed for warmth; end of story. In a sudden mountain rainstorm, your feet will get much colder than they will in traditional boots and socks.</p></li>
<li><p>Dirt - It will be difficult in muddy, dusty, or sandy conditions to keep grit out of your shoe. This is true to some extent in boots as well, but the effects are moderated with high sides and/or gaiters, tight lacing, and two pairs of socks. I suppose it is possible to wear socks and gaiters with FiveFingers, but I have a hard time picturing an effective combination. </p></li>
<li><p>Bugs and plants - This may or may not be an issue in Scotland, but in my part of the world it is not uncommon to walk through a patch of grass and come out with a half a dozen ticks on your boots and pants, searching for a patch of skin. Chiggers, leeches, sharp reeds, thistle, poison ivy, and other hazards may also be underfoot depending on the trail. I suppose the bugs could be partly addressed with a permethrin treatment.</p></li>
<li><p>Snakebites - Again, this may not be so much an issue in Scotland, but snakes were a known hazard where I grew up in Southern California. A boot and socks are thick enough at the ankle to mitigate injury from a small, young snake, but on the other hand I think I only saw about six snakes in the wild in my entire childhood.</p></li>
<li><p>Stiffness and ankle support - There are pluses and minuses to stiffness, of course, and that is part of the appeal of FiveFingers— that they do not restrict movement. Many hikers are undoubtedly overshod. Still, with a heavy backpack, it is surely easier to maintain lateral stability with a stiffer ankle.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>None of the above may be dealbreakers on their own, but they could impact your pacing; perhaps you walk more deliberately around obstacles or stop more often to adjust your toes. </p>

<p>Is there a risk of serious infection or permanent damage to skin? Or it's just about the pain endurance?</p>
","<p>It depends in part on how you got the blisters, but from the question I think we can take it to mean that they're from friction.</p>

<p>In order of what you can expect</p>

<ul>
<li>They will get worse and larger.   </li>
<li>They will pop.   </li>
<li>The friction that
you haven't dealt with will continue.  It is now rubbing on much
softer skin.  It will literally rub away skin (I've had this happen).   </li>
<li>Sweat, dirt, and bacteria will all be against and open wound in a
warm damp environment (your shoe).  You will get an infection.   </li>
<li>Because feet don't heal quickly or well, the infection will get
worse.   Eventually you'll have to see a doctor to remove the
infected tissue (this actually happened to AWOL, which he describes
in his book).   </li>
<li>Should you be insane enough to continue (this would usually take days) then you'll get a blood infection.</li>
</ul>

<p>Is that an extreme end result?  Yes.  It never happens really because ""walking through the pain"" at that point would be nigh impossible and take an extreme level of willful disregard for your health.</p>

<p>Regarding long term effects, you could have long term effects from even your 30km walk. At about stage three (direct friction to raw skin) you could easily get scarring.  I have a scar on a toe from a blister I ignored on a shorter walk.   It's a permanent annoyance because it now causes blisters on the adjacent toe very easily.</p>

"Will a tent provide some protection from bears?","23000","","<p>When camping in a bear country, will a tent provide an additional protection from bears, as opposed to just sleeping outside or in a hammock?  Provided I take the usual precautions of keeping any food, toothpaste etc in some other place than the one I sleep at?</p>
","<p>Your tent may not provide any physical protection, but your sleeping bag will provide some.  Sleeping bags cover the vast majority of your body, and <strong>the thick material of a sleeping bag will initially provide minor protection from claws and teeth</strong>.  </p>

<p>A common strategy for dealing with bear attacks is to employ counter measures.  Obviously countermeasures are difficult to employ during sleep though.  Having a sleeping bag protect you for 10 or 20 seconds prior to becoming shredded may be enough time to wake and employ countermeasures against the animal.  </p>

<p><strong>Obviously countermeasures need to be the end game in such a strategy though</strong>, because a sleeping bag will not protect against claws and teeth for long.  Bear spray and firearms are both effective countermeasures, and several studies assert bear spray is much more effective than firearms - especially at close range and when employed as an area weapon in the dark.</p>

<p>Other tools might be a camp warning system to give an audible alarm after a trip wire is disturbed.  <a href=""http://www.mec.ca/product/5043-128/brite-strike-camp-alert-perimeter-security-system/?Ntk=productsearch_en_q32008&amp;h=10&amp;q=bear"" rel=""noreferrer"">This device pulls a pin out of a siren device, which activates and audible alarm</a>.

<p><strong>In my opinion, one of the best strategies for employing bear spray after being attacked during sleep is to have a tent mate spray the bear</strong>.  Bears are solitary and don't attack in groups.  A single bear is likely only able to attack a single person at a time.  When camping in groups, the person or people not being attacked are in an excellent position to employ bear spray against the attacking animal.  Line-of-fire issues score another point for bear spray over firearms in such a case, because your buddy might shoot you accidentally while targeting the bear.  It's much easier to recover from pepper spray than a bullet wound.</p>

<p>In the year 2016 there is quite a bit of technology you can use for countermeasures against attacking bears.  If you practice preventative techniques, such as storing odorous materials out of a bear's reach and away from the campsite, then the technology available combined with friends to employ the technology should be more than enough to stay safe in bear country at night.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
Long after answering this question, I came across a bear expert's answer to this tent question in a book titled Bear Attacks: Their Causes and Avoidance.  His exact words are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have mentioned that another technique for minimizing risk while
  backcountry camping around bears is to sleep in a tent rather than
  without shelter.  Sleeping under the stars is one of my favorite
  things to do while camping, but I choose areas in which to do this
  carefully.  My data strongly suggest that people sleeping without
  tents were more likely to be injured, even killed, than were people
  who slept in tents.</p>

What are the benefits on packing the tent and sleeping bag in vs. strapping the tent and sleeping bag to the outside of the pack?</p>
","<p><strong>Outside</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>more room left inside for other stuff. </li>
<li>More likely to rip a hole in your gear when you toss your pack down. </li>
<li>More options for weight placement (which can lead to off-blanced pack.)</li>
<li>More likely to fall off.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Inside</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Better protection from the elements, rocks, branches. </li>
<li>Weight is closer to your center of gravity (and usually better balanced). </li>
<li>Less room inside your pack. </li>
<li>Will never fall off.  </li>
</ul>

<p>Ultimately, it is a matter of personal preference, but I always encourage people to pack it inside -- and insist they do when borrowing my gear.</p>

<p><em>PROTIP: When forced to pack something outside (ie, external frame, or carrying too much stuff) always use closed loop tie-downs that are threaded through a closed loop on both your pack and your gear. That way, if the gear slides off without noticing, it will still be chained to your pack.</em></p>

"Sleeping in twos in one hammock","22288","","<p>My girlfriend and I both like sleeping in hammocks in the outdoors. We now sleep in two separate hammocks. However, I've seen many hammocks that are designed, or at least make it possible to sleep with two people in it. Most notably these two:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.eaglesnestoutfittersinc.com/product/DOUBLENEST.html"">ENO DoubleNest Hammock</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://eaglesnestoutfittersinc.com/product/DOUBLE-DELUXE.html"">ENO DoubleNest Deluxe Hammock</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Possible advantages</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Warmth</strong>: two people sleeping together is warmer (an advantage in colder environments)</li>
<li><strong>Weight</strong>: one hammock is lighter than two hammocks and two tarps</li>
<li><strong>Romantic</strong>: sleeping in two separate hammocks isn't really romantic, after all :)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Possible disadvantages</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Warmth</strong>: two people sleeping together is warmer (a disadvantage in warmer environments)</li>
<li><strong>Space</strong>: it seems to me that you would just keep rolling into each other and won't actually be able to fall asleep; not necessarily from the lack of space, but rather from the natural effect of rolling to the middle of the hammock</li>
</ul>

<p>My question is: has anyone tried <strong>sleeping</strong> (not just relaxing or sitting in it) with two in one of these hammocks? Is it doable? Would you recommend it? </p>

<p>To be honest, I'm fairly skeptical myself, but I wanted to ask this question anyway because of the potential advantages. We also can't try sleeping in it for ourselves, since we both have single hammocks and we don't know anyone who owns a double hammock (and I don't think any store is going to let us try for one night). </p>

<p><em><strong>Please don't just say: that seems/doesn't seem to be a good idea.</strong> I'm looking for people who have actually tried it. I have heard a lot of opinions based on gut feelings already; that is <strong>not</strong> what I'm looking for.</em></p>
","<p>There is <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/a/3478/1908"">another post</a> in which my answer deals with this question among other things.</p>

<p>I have not yet met anyone that has tried to sleep with two people in a hammock that still practices it. I have tried it, and while it's ok for a short nap or just relaxing, for overnight and/or multiple nights it's just not comfortable or practical.</p>

<p>I have owned two ENO Doublenests and they still squeeze two people together no matter what way you set up the hammock, whether it's with sag or not. This is subjective, and you may find that it works for you, but I'm betting you won't. I have many married friends who also hammock camp and they don't share hammocks for sleeping either, even though they're accustomed to sleeping in the same bed or tent. (Actually they usually tent camp so they can stay together.)</p>

<p>One of the other big problems with trying to sleep two people in one hammock is if one person has to get up in the night, it's unavoidable to completely disturb the other person. This is assuming either of you has actually managed to stay asleep while sharing the hammock. The romance factor will have quickly lost it's momentum at this point.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that I haven't tried the <a href=""http://eaglesnestoutfittersinc.com/product/DOUBLE-DELUXE.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Deluxe ENO</a> (9'4"" x 8'4""), and while wider than a <a href=""http://eaglesnestoutfittersinc.com/product/DOUBLENEST.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Double</a> (9'4"" x 6'2""), I have my doubts that it would provide any different result for sharing a hammock overnight.

"What's the minimum diameter cord to use when climbing a rope using a prusik","21808","","<p>If I'm using two <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prusik"">prusik's</a> to climb a rope (one as a foot loop and one attached to harness directly) What's the minimum diameter of cord I should be looking for to remain safe?</p>
","<p>EDIT: When the question was posed I misinterpreted it to be asking the diameter of the ""Climbing Rope"" not ""Cord"" However my answer for Cord diameter is also listed as ""2mm less than cord diameter and not less than 5mm""</p>

<p>I would not go any lower than 7.5mm*, it is a common diameter used by rescue technicians.<br><br>There are several reasons why I recommend 7.5mm, listed below.  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>You need to remember and account for the diameter of your prussik, which following the general rule of thumb, is at least 2mm less than the rope diameter.  <strong>A 5mm (Static,Tech or Nylon) prussik supplies a good amount of grip.</strong>  If you chose a rope of smaller diameter your prussik will be approaching some very small diameter cord.</p></li>
<li><p>A 7.5mm such as the <a href=""http://www.rescueresponse.com/store/sterlings_escapetechs_personal_escapes_ropes_rescues_stetrit.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Sterling Escape Tech</a> provides good abrasion resistance, and has the ability to withstand falls, something a rope of smaller diameter may not be able to provide.</p></li>
<li><p>Any smaller than 7.5mm the rope itself will be difficult to ascend, and if you chose to descend on it the rope will have a tendency to coil up and even knot itself.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>*According to numbers a 6mm static cord can hold 1600 lbs however I would not recommend using it for the purpose of ascending, let's keep it for hoisting the bear barrels into the trees.</p>

<p><strong>If you attempt to ascend a rope using only friction knots please use a safety back up such as the system detailed below!</strong></p>

<p>As a safety precaution tie off the slack end of the rope, using a figure eight on a bite, at progressive intervals and clip to your harness. To avoid having a clutter of these knots all hanging off your harness you might choose to untie and release each previous one. Note, however, some climbers prefer the clutter to potentially getting the trailing rope snagged far below.</p>

"What's the difference between Sport Climbing and Traditional Climbing","21802","","<p>What is the difference between <code>Sport Climbing</code> and <code>Traditional (Trad) Climbing</code>? Is it just that <code>sport climbing</code> uses bolts?</p>
","<p>Both, sport climbing and trad climbing are a form of lead climbing, which means the first climber to go up is not protected by a rope from above. A sport climber uses <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quickdraw"" rel=""noreferrer"">quickdraws</a> which, as you mentioned, get clipped to bolts that have been placed in 10 to 15 foot intervals. At the end of the climb, a sport climber can expect to find a belay anchor consisting of two to three bolts with rappel rings that he/she uses to build an anchor.</p>

<p>A trad climber carries not just quick draws, but a whole rack of climbing gear consisting of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring-loaded_camming_device"" rel=""noreferrer"">cams</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nut_(climbing)"" rel=""noreferrer"">nuts</a> and sometimes <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_(climbing)"" rel=""noreferrer"">hexes</a> that get placed into cracks in the wall. In difficult to protect places there might be a bolt that has been placed by the first ascent team. At the end of the climb or pitch (one rope length on a multi-rope length climb) a trad climber often has to build an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchor_(climbing)"" rel=""noreferrer"">anchor</a> with the trad-gear, but sometimes, just like in sport climbing, routes have belay stations with two to three bolts.</p>

<p>Sometimes the classification of sport and trad climbs gets a little messy. In Joshua Tree National Park in California for example, guide books refer to some climbs as ""bolted climbs."" These climbs are by no means sport climbs, even though the only means of protection on these routs are bolts in the rock. The difference is that those bolts are spaced 30 to 60 feet apart, which means the leader might fall up to 120 feet.</p>

<p>Often sport climbs were rap-bolted, which means the first ascent party rappelled down the rout, placing bolts on their way down. Traditional climbs get established from the bottom up, which means the first ascent party placed bolts they deemed necessary as they were climbing up.</p>

"How to check if a fence or cable has electricity without having special tools?","21559","","<p>You run across a wire cable, or wire fence in the wild, with which you would have to interact in some way. How to check if electricity runs through it without having special tools?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> As the question states it could be a low-voltage fence however I could be checking some sort of cable that I happen to find going over a cliff, which I would like to use as a 'bridge'. (So question includes very high-voltage check too :) ) ...hand-testing shouldn't really be an option...</p>
","<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> - First try to <strong>identify</strong> if the wire is supposed to carry electricity (insulators on posts/wire goes to an electrical box/posted warning signs/ect...). There's really not much you can do to check the wire for current without a device aside from listening to it, touching it (potentially dangerous), or throwing something onto it that might react to a current (something wet/metallic/living/etc...). Maybe hold your arm close to see if your hairs stand up? If you have a <strong>compass</strong>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3WWAghWbjo"" rel=""noreferrer"">you <em>may</em> be able to use it to detect a magnetic field around the wire</a> depending on the type  and flow of electricity. These methods will only confirm that there <em>is</em> electricity in the wire, but without proper equipment, you can't really confirm a wire <em>isn't</em> charged, and you're operating under assumptions and risk shock by touching the wire. </p>

<hr>

<p>If you're asking how to identify an electric fence, the answer is that <strong>there will be insulators on the posts</strong>. Plain wire fences are just stapled or tied to the posts. Also, if the fence emits a powerful enough charge to hurt you, there will be caution, warning, or danger signs posted.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/86ARA.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""><br>
<sup>Insulator on steel post</sup>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YTWwl.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here"">
<sup>Insulator on wood post &amp; electric gate with insulated handle.</sup></p>

<p>I've climbed over electric fences plenty of times, they use them out here to deter bears from getting into certain areas (like the local dump) and keep deer out of crop fields. First few times I climbed through one I felt nothing, so I thought it was turned off (I was a kid at the time). It wasn't until I was holding two wires wide apart so that my dog could get through and touched the back of my hand to the wire above it that I got shocked. </p>

<p>The thing about being a human is that you're typically insulated against the ground to some degree because of the rubber soles of your boots. Electric fences only really work if you're grounded or touching more than one wire. Even if you do get shocked, it's meant to smart, not injure, at the very most you might get a little red burn. Electric fences don't use a constant current, they pulse, sending out shocks that don't feel too dissimilar to a shock from a BBQ sparker. </p>

<p>Of course this is only true for fences designed to keep animals at bay, if you encounter an electric fence designed to keep humans out, they will typically have big signs indicating that they are charged and will hurt you. Razor wire at the top is another give-away. </p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT: In response to edit by OP. If you happen upon a cable that you might want to use for a crossing, first of all, <strong><em>use common sense</em></strong>. Ask yourself, ""Why is this cable here?"" Is it meant to carry electricity, or does it have some other purpose? <em>Your number one priority is still to identify if it is an electrical cable or not.</em> In my part of the world it's common to happen across a forestry cable car for crossing creeks or canyons:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2QZ90.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""> </p>

<p>But they're typically a dead giveaway, the cables don't extend beyond the anchors, and there's a basket with pulley wheels.</p>

<p>You are not going to be able to <em>easily</em> access high-power electrical cables, they're put high up on poles for a reason, <em>and won't necessarily carry your weight.</em> The biggest giveaway that a cable is carrying a lot of electricity is that it will hum. Every power cable I've been under in the backcountry is easy to hear especially if it's raining or snowing. </p>

<p><strong>To be brief:</strong> there's not much you can do to safely detect electrical current in a wire without some sort of a device, but something that you may have on your person if you're in the woods, is a <strong>COMPASS</strong> which you could use to check for an electrical current. Hold the compass near the wire, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3WWAghWbjo"" rel=""noreferrer"">the magnetic field will move the needle</a> if there is a current in the wire. </p>

"What's the most remote place in the contiguous US?","21030","","<p>The United States is a very developed place. Sometimes this can prove to be challenging when trying to find a place to get away from everything, especially east of the Mississippi where I reside.

<li><p>Furthest distance from civilization or any signs of it including anything man-made like roads, forest service facilities, huts/shelters...</p></li>

<p><em>Now, I know this could seem like an opinionated question to some folks, but I'm really looking for places that can be backed up and grounded with as much factual data as possible.</em></p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> <em>I previously said ""continental"" US, when the correct term is ""contiguous."" Oops. Please bear that in mind regarding my comments below.</em></p>

"When/Where do foxes attack humans?","20800","","<p>There is an area that I would like to explore at daytime and at night time.</p>

<p>I have seen only two foxes in that area during the day time. One of the locals told me not to go out at night because foxes hunt as pack and they might attack even a human.</p>

<p>It almost sounds to me like the foxes live close to the area.</p>

<p>Do foxes care day/night when they decide to attack human? </p>

<p>What triggers them to attack a human?</p>

<p>Update 1: To everyone who took time to write answers &amp; comments, I'm really sorry. I somehow thought it was foxes..I should have asked ""When/Where do coyotes attack human?"". However, I think it's nice to know..foxes do not attack human..</p>
","<p><strong>TLDR</strong>:  Foxes do not attack humans. So you can go there day and night. To me this sounds more like a spooking story than reality.</p>

<p>Foxes hunt very small animals, humans are way too big for them. Anyway, in their natural habitat they are extremely shy and will run away from you most likely before you are even aware of its presence.</p>

<p>Foxes with rabies can lose their natural fear of humans. I know that Switzerland and UK are considered rabies free and I believe this is true for many European countries. So this is no concern in these areas, in other parts of the world it is a valid concern. Not specific to foxes but in many species.</p>

<p>Another problem is that foxes penetrate urban areas scavenging for food. There they get somewhat accustomed to people. While this mean that the chances of coming across a fox is higher, they are still shy and will never be the aggressor. Of course the usual applies: If you corner the animal or if you threaten pups, they will attack - but only as the very last measure.</p>

<p>To specifically answer the question about whether they attack at day or night: Neither, as explained above. But as they are mainly night active, you are more likely to encounter one at night so the extremely unlikely event of an attack would be more likely at night.</p>

<p>One personal experience: We once grilled chicken in the forest close to a city. There was one fox who tried over and over to get close so it can steal some chicken. Whenever we saw it and made any motion towards it, it ran away. However it was extremely cunning at moving in the shades of the trees, so with time it got quite close, but never reached its goal. :)</p>

"What's wrong with swimming out far?","20648","","<p>I swim decently - no pro but I can do a couple of km, resting once in awhile.  Many times, both in day and night, in the warm, summer, Mediterranean sea, friends have cautioned me to ""not swim so far out"".</p>

<p>This has happened both in day and at night; I suppose there's a different answer for each.  The water never gets cold at the distances I go, there's no jellyfish or anything like that out there, and I watch out for boats.</p>

<p>So, what's wrong with swimming out far?</p>
","<p>There don't seem to be any detailed statistics, but common-sense will tell you that open-water swimming away from the shore is not risk-free. The hazards can be split into four categories:</p>

<p><strong>1 - Wind and currents</strong></p>

<p>Even in the Med wind and currents can be problematic. On one windy day in 2013, for example, <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2380565/Seven-people-drown-seas-Frances-Mediterranean-coast-80mph-winds-unpredictable-currents-cause-treacherous-conditions.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">seven swimmers drowned</a> along just one stretch of the French coast. The weather can be unpredictable and sudden storms are common. The farther out you are, the more wind and current will come into play.</p>

<p><strong>2 - Boats</strong></p>

<p>You may keep an eye open for boats - but are they keeping an eye open for you? A lot of people in hire boats barely know what they are doing, and every year bathers are run down. As a swimmer you are not very visible, particularly at night. </p>

<p>You can reduce the risk a little by wearing a fluorescent cap and trailing a high-viz float:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/omNSH.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/omNSH.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p><a href=""http://www.swimsecure.co.uk/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Credit: SwimSecure</a></p>

<p>The farther out you are, the more you are at risk from boats that won't be on the lookout for swimmers.</p>

<p><strong>3 - Sea life</strong></p>

<p>Jellyfish in the Med are <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jun/03/jellyfish-surge-mediterranean-environment-tourists"" rel=""noreferrer"">a significant danger</a>, with over 150,000 swimmers being treated each year. Stings can be toxic enough to cause you difficulties. I'm not sure how you can be so confident that there are no jellyfish where you swim.</p>

<p>The farther out you are, the more difficult it becomes to get back to shore if you are badly stung.</p>

<p><strong>4 - Sudden illness or incapacity</strong></p>

<p>Any sudden incapacity in deep water can be fatal, so cramp, heart-attack, stroke, asthma etc will have more serious consequences, particularly if you are swimming alone. </p>

<p>A friend of mine drowned while swimming in warm water when it seems that he simply fainted. He was young, fit and healthy and had never fainted before, so we'll never know why it happened. A prominent member of the wild swimming community in Devon where I live was found drowned while swimming solo in open water. He was super-fit and highly experienced. </p>

<p>You can improve your chances of surviving an incapacity by learning the <a href=""http://www.drownproofing.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Drownproofing technique</a>, which enables you to float efficiently without full use of your arms and legs.</p>

<p>Clearly, the farther out you are the more difficult it becomes to survive any sudden incapacity.</p>

<p>So while you couldn't say that offshore swimming in the Med is unjustifiable, the dangers are significant. Especially if you are swimming alone, it would be more prudent to swim parallel to the shore where you can reach safely quickly if you get into trouble. Is it really worth the extra risk to swim farther out? Only you can decide - but do it with a realistic understanding of the risks.</p>

"Should I run if I see wild dogs?","20600","","<p>Wild dogs appear to be dangerous. Should I be running if I come across one, or should I stand fast and defend myself? They are a social animal, so they will be in a pack almost all the times.</p>
","<p>Wild dogs can indeed be dangerous, and packs can be extremely dangerous.  You do not want to take on a pack of dogs if you can at all avoid it, and running is often a particularly bad idea.</p>

<p>I suggest starting with the basics: try to keep the dog calm and don't try to intimidate it.  This means:</p>

<ol>
<li>Don't make direct eye contact, and remember that sunglasses look like large unblinking eyes.</li>
<li>Don't smile (it bares your teeth, which can be similarly threatening).</li>
<li>Don't approach it, and don't make sudden moves or shout at them.</li>
<li>Do keep an eye on it, and you can try calmly talking.</li>
</ol>

<p>Above all, don't ""act like food"".  Turning your back, acting afraid, or trying to run away will show weakness and probably trigger their prey drive.  Your job is to act bored until they aren't interested in you, then to slowly back away.</p>

<p>If they are still acting aggressive and you have the time, prepare for an attack.  Quickly see if there's anything you can use as a weapon.  If you have a jacket, wrap it around your weaker forearm.  If you have a pack, ready it to fend them off.  Yelling for help may be a good idea, in case others are nearby.  In an attack, two things are very important:</p>

<ol>
<li>Protect your face and neck.</li>
<li>Do not let yourself be taken to the ground*.</li>
</ol>

<p>A dog can move quickly, and trying to hit the dog will likely be counterproductive (unless you happen to have a bat or stick).  Instead, try to keep something between you and it, even if it's just your forearm.  Here is where things start to get ugly.  If it latches onto your arm, remember that you still have your other arm and both legs.  Be careful to keep your balance, and don't worry about trying to free your arm immediately; the one bright spot is that its mouth is otherwise occupied.  Instead, focus on attacking the dog.  This is an excellent time to deploy pepper spray or a knife.  Absent that, shoving a stick or even your arm down its throat may be appropriate, or strikes to its throat and eyes.  (At this point, you are way beyond a newspaper swat to the nose, and there's a good chance you may need to kill it.  Hopefully there's a good chance you outweigh it.)</p>

<p>*If you do get taken to the ground, protect your neck and roll around quickly.  Letting the dog get a solid bite on your arm (see above) will be better than letting it get hold of your throat.</p>

<p>When dealing with a pack you're in significant danger.  A defensible location and weapons will be very helpful.  I suggest a fighting retreat; turn your back and they'll take you down, and they'll probably try to flank you as well.</p>

<p>Finally, if you survive an attack there's a good chance rabies may be in play, so get yourself to a hospital immediately.</p>

"Is the ""Rule of 3"" proven for food?","20427","","<p>The proverbial ""<a href=""http://www.shtfplan.com/emergency-preparedness/survival-priorities-the-rule-of-three_01092010"">Rule of 3</a>"" says you can live three weeks without food.  Are there any documented cases of people actually living three weeks with no food in the wilderness and surviving?  </p>

<p>For those who aren't familiar with the rule, it's that you can't live more than:</p>

<ul>
<li>3 minutes without breathing (drowning, asphyxiation)</li>
<li>3 hours without shelter in an extreme environment (exposure)</li>
<li>3 days without water (dehydration)</li>
<li>3 weeks without food (starvation)</li>
</ul>
","<p>The rule of three may be a useful mnemonic to help prioritise or plan in a survival situation, but it is not necessarily going to be accurate. Survival without food is going to depend on many factors, for example, the nutritional state of the person at the start of their starvation and the amount of energy they expend during the starvation. These factors will shorten or extend the three week estimate.</p>

<p>One example of survival with negligible food intake longer than three weeks is <a href=""http://www.medicaltranslation.com.au/medical-translation-articles/1992/3/8/james-scott-how-i-survived/"">the story of James Scott</a> who survived 43 days lost in Nepal eating only some vegetation and a caterpillar.

<p>On the three minutes without breathing rule, an extreme example that contradicts this is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_Apnea"">static apnea</a> (freediving breath holding) <a href=""http://www.aidainternational.org/competitive/worlds-records"">record of 11 minutes and 35 seconds</a>.</p>

"What types of kayaks are suitable for occasional class 1 and 2 rapids","19929","","<p>According to the scale on this <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitewater"">Wikipedia page</a> (the International Scale of River Difficulty), what are the types of kayaks in the following list that are suitable to occasionally handle class 1 and 2 rapids ?</p>

<ul>
<li>whitewater</li>
<li>sea</li>
<li>recreational</li>
<li>sit on top</li>
</ul>

<p>By occasionally I mean, no more than 20% of the time spent kayaking. </p>
","<p>I understand your goal in asking this question, but I think you're approaching it wrong: you should choose a kayak based on your skill and expected use. Each type of kayak will have benefits and drawbacks in each type of water, and some are completely unsuited for it -- choose one that fits your uses best. A well-known example: a recreational kayak is the wrong choice for kayaking on the ocean.</p>

<p>Class 1 and 2 rapids are fantastic. I think it's probably fair to say that anybody with no skill and the right boat can make it through class 1 rapids with no concern. I think class 2 rapids should probably be handled by somebody with at least a little experience on the water, and the less experienced should always be accompanied by somebody more experienced.</p>

<p>So, I am confident that you could do some class 1 rapids with any of those types of kayaks. For class two rapids, I would first be concerned with your skill level -- both on the water in general, and with the type of kayak being used (and maybe even the specific model). While class two rapids may not require much maneuvering, spinning a 20' sea/touring kayak is going to be practically impossible and therefore impractical; a 14-16' sea kayak is probably manageable for any experienced paddler. A whitewater or completely flat-bottomed rec kayak provide the maneuverability required, however a less experienced paddler will find themselves spinning with each stroke and out of control -- and therefore perhaps in a dangerous situation.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the right choice for a new paddler is a rec kayak. They're fun, easy to use, and relatively cheap to buy/rent. Getting some experience with an eye towards determining what you ultimately want to do will help you make an informed decision. Rent a few times and take a lesson or two and you'll have gained a huge amount of experience to help you know what kind of kayak you really want and will lead you to the best choice.</p>

<p>Experience is king. An experienced paddler will be able to take anything through class 1 or 2 rapids, no doubt. An inexperienced paddler could end up in a dangerous situation. I think it's essential to start out on calm flat water to learn strokes, practice technique, and gain some confidence. On that flat water you can learn to maneuver the kayak around strainers, rocks, or buoys. You can learn how a sweep differs from a front stroke, and what you can make the kayak do with each of those. Also on flat water, try working in windy conditions -- it'll do a surprisingly good job of mimicking how a river and rapids can push your boat around and teach you how to handle it. Once confident, go out on a slow river to put your skills to the test. Eventually move up to some faster moving water, and throw in a class 1 rapid. Try a short class 2 next. Then if you can find it, go through a <em>long</em> class 2 -- you'll get splashed quite a bit and get a solid workout. After working through class 2 you might want to step up to class 3.</p>

<p>While gaining all of this experience you're going to learn how a kayak handles and what it does well and poorly, and more importantly you're going to see how your skill grows with it. As you do this stuff you'll be able to recognize where each type of boat is the right choice.</p>

<p>Trying to more directly answer your question: IMO, a whitewater kayak is only useful for whitewater/surfing waves. A sit on top is good for jumping in and out of the water. A rec kayak is a good choice for many. A short touring/sea kayak is a good choice for many. A long touring/sea kayak is the right choice for racers and travelers.</p>

"How to react to cattle charging towards you?","19668","","<p>Cattle may get aggressive when threatened, or they might just imitate to be aggressive. I have seen cattle charging towards a person when irritated. </p>

<p>How should one react if a cow or bull comes charging towards him/her?</p>

<p>EDIT: I think the word 'cattle' can have lots of possibilities. So I think its better that I narrow down the scope a bit. Lets just stick to the domestic cows and bulls, and strictly not the wild cattle. I am extremely sorry if this edit affects any of the answer significantly. Nonetheless, you all have my upvote.</p>
","<p>In the UK (we don't have many dangerous animals) cows are the most dangerous animals you're likely to come across. They kill about a dozen people every year.</p>

<p>Typically most deaths are caused by herds trampling people/farmers. A lot of people are wary of bulls. In my experience a herd of mother cows is more dangerous, especially if the cows think you are a threat (i.e. have a barking dog snapping at their heels). The single most dangerous situation is a spooked herd running at you in a confined space. So don't put your self in that situation.</p>

<p>Typically, like many things, prevention is better than reaction. So always be aware of cows in a field. Couple of things to be wary of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do the cow(s) have calves? This is typically how most people get into trouble, a mother cow will protect her calf.</li>
<li>Do you have a dog with you? Keep dogs on leads in fields with cows. If your dog is attacked by a cow, <strong>don't try and save it</strong>, a dog will outrun a cow, you won't!</li>
<li>Is it a single cow approaching or is the herd stampeding? A single cow is likely more scared of you than you are of it. Just stand your ground, make a lot of noise, it will likely just run away. <strong>If the herd is stampeding or a bull is running at then you're in trouble</strong>, get to the edge of the field ASAP, try and get something between you and the cow(s).</li>
<li><strong>Stay visible, and make a noise</strong>. Cows are not predators (Taken from
Tim B's answer), they're not out to get you. But a startled cow will run and this may be towards
other people or yourself, if it feels threatened. So make your presence known. Making a noise may attract some careful attention, the cows may think they're getting fed. Don't be too alarmed by this, it's normal and they just think you're the farmer. Typically (I find) cows with calves or bulls will stay out of your way rather than approach you like this.</li>
<li>Is there a bull in the field? If yes, is it alone or with other cows? A bull with cows is likely to be more territorial than a lone bull off season.</li>
<li>Is it breeding season? Bulls will be more aggressive when rutting, hence a bull with cows is more aggressive than on its own.</li>
</ul>

<p>If in doubt (regardless of where the footpath may go) walk around the edge of the field, avoid the cows as best as you can. Farmers are typically happier for you to do this than stamp though their fields anyway. Try not to antagonise the cows (especially if they have calves). </p>

<p>In the UK fields with bulls in must be marked. It is illegal to put bulls in fields with a footpath though it.</p>

"Does packing boots with newspaper make them dry faster?","18854","","<p>In one of the trail journals I read, the author mentions packing her boots with newspaper to dry them out.  On the one hand I can see perhaps some wicking action, but this would greatly reduce airflow.</p>

<p>Will this actually help dry shoes out?</p>
","<p>Yes it does dry shoes much faster. When long distance hiking it is definitely a nice thing to be able to stop in town and dry your shoes overnight using newspapers. It will draw a lot of the dampness right out of your footwear.</p>

<p>This is a known trick and <a href=""http://macgyverisms.wonderhowto.com/how-to/dry-your-soaking-wet-shoes-faster-without-shrinking-them-dryer-0146406/"">many</a> people will <a href=""http://experimentalrunning.blogspot.com/2010/03/old-balled-up-newspaper-trick.html"">attest to its magic</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First ball up some newspaper. I usually use <strong>two large sheets per shoe</strong>, but I'm sure more motivated people could squish in more. Once you have a ball of newspaper shove it into that nasty wet sneaker, and <strong>keep shoving in balls of newspaper until the shoe is full</strong> of newspaper. <strong>Leave it overnight</strong>, and the next day your shoes will be dry! <strong>If they're really wet, you may want to replace the newspaper after a few hours</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some people will also wrap the outside of the the shoe with newspaper and elastic bands. I've personally never used this before.</p>

<p>Before using the newspaper, I usually take a <a href=""http://www.zpacks.com/accessories/towel.shtml"">lightload towel</a> and place it inside my shoe. I will than press on it using my foot and extract as much water as possible from the sole. I repeat the process until no more water is drawn and then use the newspaper.</p>

"What should I do when caught in lightning while in my tent?","18842","","<p>Suppose I'm caught in a heavy thunderstorm while lying in my tent, on my foam sleeping bad, in my nice waterproof tent.  Suppose I have a good campsite so I don't need to worry about flash floods.  However, suppose that I happen to be in a rather exposed place, far away from any forests.  What is the safest thing to do, to minimise the risk of injury (or worse) as a result of a lightning strike?</p>

<p>See also: <em><a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/3012/is-my-tent-pole-a-lightning-rod"">Is my tent pole a lightning rod?</a></em></p>
","<p>The first thing to do is to not pitch your tent in the middle of a flat area when there is a chance of thunderstorms.  Sometimes that's not so easy, but that doesn't make it any less a good thing to do.</p>

<p>For a <i>properly sited</i> tent, the best thing to do during a thunderstorm is to stay put.  Lightning shouldn't hit the tent directly, but it could hit something else nearby.  That can cause large ground currents, which causes voltage over a distance accross the ground.  Inside your sleeping bag on a insulated pad on top of the tent floor should be fairly safe from voltages caused by large ground currents.</p>

<p>If you are in badly sited tent, like in the middle of a flat area with the tent being the tallest thing around, then staying put inside your sleepping bag is still the best thing to do in a bad circumstance.  If lightning does strike your tent, then there is at least some chance the current will be conducted by the wet skin of the tent or the tent poles (if metal).  This will make the current go around you instead of thru you to the ground.  It will be very unpleasant nonetheless, but still a whole lot better than getting zapped directly.</p>

<p>Again, the right answer is to not get yourself into this circumstance in the first place.</p>

"is it a good idea to cover a tent with a tarp to protect for heavy rainfall?","18808","","<p>Last summer, I went camping with my family for the first time. We bought a second hand tent, similar to the one on the picture below. We had a great time, but after a rainstorm that went on for 24 hours, the tent started leaking at the seams at the top, causing the rain to drip down at the inside and soaking our sleeping bags. More rain was coming for the next day, so we were forced to pack up our wet tent and return back home a few days earlier than planned.
Back home, we discovered that the rubbery sealing of the seams had worn out, so we have repaired this, but it might not provide enough protection for heavy rainfall during a next camping trip.
So I was thinking to bring a large tarpaulin and use that to cover the tent at the top.
Is this a good idea ? Or might this get dangerous if heavy wind gets under the tarp ? And should I tighten the tarp directly over the tent (like <a href=""https://tips4camping.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/210c-settingup-tarpovertent-20090905grundylake11-resized.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a>) or keep some distance using cords (like <a href=""http://cdn.instructables.com/FDH/XT78/FA190M34/FDHXT78FA190M34.LARGE.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a>) ?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eXBBz.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<h2>First of all</h2>

<p>you might need to look into getting a new <strong>impregnation</strong> for your second hand tent. This can be done either yourself using sprays or wash-in-products (and in your case a probably huge washing maschine) or by giving the tent for re-impregnation to professionals, i.e. your local outdoor/tent supplier (this can be expensive though). In any case it might be a good idea to get their professional opinion on if and how you could re-impregnate the tent.</p>

<h2>As for the <strong>tarp</strong> idea</h2>

<p>This is totally feasible and also quite cheap. The main disadvantage is the added weight and packing space. But looking at the size of your tent it seems you're likely not carrying it for any kind distance, so the additional weight of a tarp (and the needed additional tent pegs/cords) won't be much of a problem.</p>

<p>I's also possible to just directly tighten the tarp over your tent. This will actually make the entire construction quite a bit more stable I'd guess, as their will be less area of attack for wind. Just make sure to tie the entire thing down well enough and you should have no worries.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong><br>
As correctly mentioned by @mattnz draping a tarp directly onto your fly sheet can lower its life expectancy, as friction between the two (cause by wind for example) can degrade the impregnation a bit. But seeing as your fly sheet is not currently rain-proof in the first place I think you'll still be better off with an additional tarp than without: that way at least you should have a working (read: rain-proof) construction for the time being.</p>

"Should overweight people ever climb?","18545","","<p>I used to be a regular climber, and unfortunately I have put on some serious weight over the last 4 years, and I have not been able to climb as much as would have loved to.</p>

<p>While, I am still working on my schedule to get back to climbing gym, many of the people I know have been trolling me that the apple have fallen far away from the tree now (That, its too late for me to start climbing again). I do my best to avoid those talks, but can't help but notice that it is actually making sense, I haven't seen fat climbers around.</p>

<p>Why aren't there any fat climbers? Or more importantly, should fat people ever climb?</p>
","<p>Should overweight people climb? If they want to, then yes of course they should.</p>

<p>I don't have any hard fact to back it up, but I do know a few climbers that are slightly overweight and have participated in guiding climbing days where some participants where seriously overweight (in some cases due to obvious medical reasons, in other cases I don't know why).</p>

<p>As climbing is vertical, there is an obvious disadvantage of the additional weight. This even applies to friends who do cycling and climbing: They usually complain that they need to lift those huge thighs up the wall. Also looking at pros like Adam Ondra (especially in his younger years) and at kids around 8-12 years, the incredible strength to weight ratio is apparent.</p>

<p>Now that all sounds like I am arguing against climbing when overweight - far from it. You need to adhere to the same principles any beginner or anyone on re-entry needs to: Listen to your body, don't pressure yourself or let anyone pressure you into doing anything you don't feel comfortable with. This is especially hard if you climbed a certain grade some years ago: You won't reach it immediately. Go at an easy level such that you enjoy climbing and start raising the level in a way you feel comfortable with or stay at the level you like, nothing wrong with that.</p>

<p>No matter if you are perfectly fine with your weight and just want to climb, or if you want to climb and lose some weight, climbing is a great activity to do it - don't let yourself be talked out of it by obviously badly informed peers.</p>

<p>Addendum (not directly relevant to the question):<br>
As other answers and comments tend to go in a different direction, let me give a motivation for this answer, skip it if you don't care:<br>
I know the OP does already do high-altitude mountaineering, so I considered this to be about rock-climbing in the narrower sense, not climbing as in every activity involving non-horizontal motion in the broader sense. Also the question is centered on social interactions, being negative about climbing while being overweight - that's what my answer addresses. The question does not mention any technical issues about climbing. There are technical/security related aspects to be considered, but there is nothing preventing you from climbing. This is nothing against other answer, it just provides my reasoning why I don't include such points, as brought up in comments, in this answer.</p>

"What should I feed ravens/crows?","17829","","<p>There are some big raven's I've noticed visit our housing estate in the early am. They're big majestic birds and I quite like them. What food would you put out to encourage these into your garden?</p>

<p>Will they be noisy? They seems fine now, but having lived by a rookery in the past I know the noise they can make can be pretty loud.</p>
","<p>We love crows! I live in America, so our crow is a bit different from the ravens found in some other parts of the world. Although there are many varieties of each, their diets are fairly similar, so to make it easy for me, I'll call them all crows from here on!</p>

<p>Crows are omnivores, and variety is important for their health. Their staple diet, however, is meat in many forms. Since other answers and comments have thoroughly covered that, I'll add a few other things that may work for you.</p>

<p><strong>Seeds and nuts:</strong> In my experience, like yours, crows don't really like bird seed, especially the small seeds we feed the songbirds. They will eat larger seeds, though, like sunflower, (which are plentiful in my yard as that's what we feed our birds year-round) and pumpkin. Crows love nuts! We feed whole, unsalted peanuts in the shell. They take one, crack it on a nearby rock, and pick out the nuts. If we try to make it easier by putting out individual nuts, they will eat them, but if we feed both, they always choose the whole. The same is true of walnuts and almonds, so there must be a desire to work for their food, which probably stems from the same instinct as pulling apart road kill. </p>

<p><strong>Berries and fruit:</strong> For much of the year, crows easily find berries and fruit on their own. They'll eat almost any wild food growing on trees in the woods, or on bushes or vines around your yard. Even things that are poisonous to people are fine food for crows. Some examples are poison oak, sumac, dogwood, and pokeberry. If you've invited crows into your yard, make sure to provide fruit year-round. Grapes, cherries, apples, cranberries, blueberries and figs are all good choices. Our crows won't eat anything in the citrus family, but your birds might.</p>

<p><strong>Grains:</strong> Our crows love dehydrated corn. We sprinkle <a href=""http://kaytee.com/products/cracked-corn.php"">loose kernels</a> from a bag around the yard, and they're gone in a flash! The same corn is available <a href=""http://kaytee.com/products/corn-on-a-cob.php"">on the cob</a>. These are multi-purpose. Many of our larger birds like them, and they're a huge favorite of other backyard visitors, especially squirrels and chipmunks. I've read that crows like other grains like barley and wheat, but I haven't tried those.</p>

<p><strong>Miscellaneous:</strong> Our crows like whole hard-boiled eggs. We take the shells off, but it's probably not necessary. Crows also eat a variety of things that wash up on the beach. I wonder what the fish-equivalent name is to road kill. Maybe ocean kill?! You could try putting out dishes of fish carcass and leftover raw shellfish, but I haven't done it.</p>

<p><strong>Backyard:</strong> Lots of living things in the yard appeal to crows, including insects, worms, spiders and small animals like frogs. Contrary to what some people say, crows can benefit the yard, as they eat the types of grubs and insects that endanger plants and food crops. They do eat some rodents, small birds, and nest eggs, but if we keep the crows well-fed, our other creatures are safer than we think.</p>

<p>As @michael mentioned, crows are very intelligent, and ravens even moreso. They're also quite sociable, and are content to let you sit nearby while they wander around the yard. A friend of mine in Florida has a crow that will take a nut or hunk of meat right out of her hand. Establishing a relationship like that takes time, but is well worth it!</p>

<p>As for being noisy while they eat, I haven't found that to be true. They may squawk when they're hungry, but they seem to make more noise in the trees than on the lawn, or at the feeding areas in our yard. I happen to love the sound, but I love all animal sounds, so I might not be the right one to give you an opinion! Ravens seem to have a wider variety of calls than crows, some being less ear-piercing and more tolerable. </p>

But the problem is that I live in an apartment. <strong>How can I mount a fingerboard in an apartment?</strong></p>

<p>What options are there in an apartment to mount a fingerboard without definitely losing my security deposit? The goal will be to spend a lot of time hanging off of this thing, so it will need to be very reliable bearing my weight.</p>

<p>I have been assuming I NEED to mount this to the wall permanently. Is there another option? Is there an inexpensive way to build a free-standing structure for it?</p>
","<p>You have a few options:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Don't worry about the lease</strong> and accept the fact that you may lose your security deposit.  You can take the board down before you move out, spackle over the holes, and hope the landlord doesn't notice.  I live in the US, and that seems to be the preferred option here.  Everyone I know who has a hangboard has done this, and they seem to get away with it.</li>
<li><strong>Build a system board, and mount the hangboard to the top</strong>.  You can build a freestanding structure like <a href=""http://www.moonclimbing.com/blog/school/build-your-own-moon-board/"">this</a>, and mount a hangboard to the top.  I don't have a design handy, but a friend of mine build a variation of this design where there was space to mount the hangboard on top. This would take up a large amount of floorspace, and be the most expensive option.</li>
<li>Use another product:
<ul>
<li><strong>Metolius Rock Rings</strong>: You could suspend a pair of Metolius Rock Rings from a doorjam mounted pull-up bar, like in this <a href=""http://media.photobucket.com/image/recent/naitcherboi/RockRings1.jpg"">this picture</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Blank Slate board</strong>: <a href=""http://www.blankslateclimbing.com/shop/item/blank-slate/"">here</a>  its another hangboard from a different company, but it comes attached to its own removable doorjamb mounted frame.  I've never actually used one, just seen them advertised.</li>

"How much sea water can I safely drink?","17109","","<p>Anyone who has played in the ocean knows getting a little sea water in your mouth and swallowing it will not kill you.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Seawater contains salt. When humans drink seawater, their cells are thus taking in water and salt. While humans can safely ingest small amounts of salt, the salt content in seawater is much higher than what can be processed by the human body. Additionally, when we consume salt as part of our daily diets, we also drink liquids, which help to dilute the salt and keep it at a healthy level. Living cells do depend on sodium chloride (salt) to maintain the body’s chemical balances and reactions; however, too much sodium can be deadly.</p>
  
  <p>Human kidneys can only make urine that is less salty than salt water. Therefore, to get rid of all the excess salt taken in by drinking seawater, you have to urinate more water than you drank. Eventually, you die of dehydration even as you become thirstier.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/drinksw.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Source NOAA</a></p>

<p>If I am thirsty and I drink sea water, it will make things worse. During normal activities if you have taken in some sea water, you will naturally consume enough fresh water (or fluids) to flush excessive salt out.</p>

<p>Maybe the real question is; if you drink sea water, how much fresh water do you need to drink to off set the sea water you drank?  For every 1 unit of sea water, how many units of fresh water do I need to act as an antidote? </p>

<p>As pointed out in answers to the question <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/4929"">How safe is drinking distilled water?</a> it takes a lot of energy to make fresh water from sea water. Assume you are in a survival situation, with only sea water available, one of your companions has consumed a quantity (1 unit) of sea water.</p>
","<p>How much sea water can I safely drink? = <strong>None</strong></p>

<p>If you drink sea water, how much fresh water do you need to drink to off set the sea water you drank? = <strong>2.8 units of distilled water per 1 unit of sea water</strong> (<em>to neutralize without adding hydration</em>) </p>

<p>The ""scientific"" answer to this question involves a lot of complex math, human physiology and significant variables.  In its simplest form the question has one concept and two factors</p>

<p><strong>Concept</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonicity"">Tonicity:</a> in the same way that water in a container always wants to be at the same level (flat) it also wants to contain the same amount of salt. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paH97dYR6Lg"">Humans are ""Bags of Mostly Water""</a> that need to keep a specific ratio of salt to water, when the ratio of salt to water becomes too great the body dies of dehydration. </p>

<p><strong>Factors</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)#Normal"">Normal Saline</a> is a medical grade mixture of salt and water.  It contains essentially the same amount of salt and water as a normally hydrated human. If you drink this it will not increase or decrease your hydration (<em>you won't get more or less thirsty</em>). It contains 9 grams  of salt (NaCl) per liter of water. </p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seawater#Salinity"">Salinity of seawater:</a>, there are a lot of variables, but on average seawater has a salinity of about 35 grams per liter of water.  </p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>To keep the balance of added salt and added water to a human body.  You need to add them in the in the ratios as they are present, 9 grams per liter.</p>

<p>Seawater has 35 grams per liter of salt, if we mix one liter of distilled (no salt) water with one liter of seawater, we have 17.5 grams of salt for each liter of water present. When you do the math (3.5 / 0.9 = 3.8) it turns out you need a total 3.8 liters of water to get the same ratio of salt to water.  So you need to add 2.8 litters of distilled water to your 1 liter of seawater to be neutral (isotonic).</p>

<p><strong>It ain't simple</strong></p>

<p>There are a lot of variables, and even <a href=""http://www.brighthub.com/education/homework-tips/articles/24750.aspx"">some controversy</a>.  In the end it is undeniable that if obtaining fresh water is difficult, drinking some seawater is not going to make things better. If you are in survival situation, there is no ""safe amount"" of seawater you can drink. </p>

"Why do some knives have one-sided sharpening?","16940","","<p>Although most knives I have seen have their edge symmetrical, others (often serrated ones) have the edge ground out only from one side (the side of the serrations). There are also some straight edge examples, like the <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000PW56QG"">PECK</a>.  Why is this necessary, does it have significant benefits and is it exclusively linked with serrated knives?  </p>

<p>Sorry for not posting pictures, I couldn't google hard enough to find some.</p>
","<p>Serrations are formed on one side due to the method of manufacture (a formed grinding wheel).  I suppose it would be possible to grind serrations from both sides with very careful alignment but I cannot recall seeing this on any production knives.</p>

<p>Single-side or ""chisel grind"" blades not restricted to serrated knives.  Nearly all <a href=""http://korin.com/Learn/About-Japanese-Knives"" rel=""noreferrer"">traditional Japanese knives</a> use this design:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The single-edged blade is a unique feature of traditional Japanese
  knives directly linked to Japanese cuisine. Traditional Japanese
  cuisine aims to preserve and accentuate the true flavors of fresh and
  seasonal ingredients, and a sharp knife is essential to this process.</p>
  
  <p>To achieve their ""unforgettable sharpness,"" traditional knives are
  razor sharp on one side and slightly concave on the reverse side. This
  design creates an overall sharper cutting edge, makes resharpening
  easier, and allows for more sensitive culinary work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This design allows for easier hand sharpening (on a water stone) because of the construction.  The back of the blade (called the ""ura"") is actually hollow, flattened at the perimeter, as seen on <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FKvUQ.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">this chisel</a>. (On knives the flattened area is much smaller and harder to see.)  The front uses a very wide bevel.  Each surface is placed flat on the stone to sharpen and acts as a natural guide, though much skill is still required.  Here is an exaggerated-scale cross section:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XVQJK.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>(<a href=""http://www.tcblades.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/images/cross_section.24091018_std.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">This one</a> is more proportionate)</p>

<p>It allows for a keener cutting edge on a knife of a given thickness.  It also changes the way the knife cuts and the manner in which it is held.  The steel used in these knives needs to be very hard to support the low angle edge but they are fragile as a result.</p>

<hr>

<p>Some manufacturers such as <a href=""http://www.emersonknives.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Emerson Knives</a> use a single side grind, but it does not benefit from the method of sharpening that Japanese knives (and chisels) have because it lacks the hollow back and single flat bevel required.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In use these knives ""steer"" to one side making it difficult to cut straight lines (in cardboard, for example).</p></li>
<li><p>They also bite in asymmetrically, cutting in a shaving motion when held at a very low angle on one side, but requiring a much steeper angle on the other (typically much steeper than double sided blades).  Further, these designs are usually ground on the <em>left</em> side of the knife (as typically are serrations on pocket knives), presumably for appearance when held in the right hand; this is actually backward for right-handed use in a normal grip. (Compare the traditional Japanese knives which have the bevel on the other side.)</p></li>
<li><p>They are not keener (lower angle; thinner) than other pocket knives because the steel and their intended use will not support it.  Because the edge angle is produced (almost) entirely by the bevel on one side the final bevel has to be about twice as steep as comparable blades (around 30°).  This causes problems for guided sharpening systems because they typically do not go up that high.</p></li>

  sharpening Mundials.</p>
  
  <p>Here's a video from Chefs Armoury
  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TPDgdo7jfM"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TPDgdo7jfM</a></p>
  
  <p><strong>1. Prep your stones</strong></p>
  
  <p>Depending on what stones you use, you may need to soak or not. I use
  the Naniwa stones that just need to be wet and don't require soaking.
  I keep a spray bottle for this. I use 400, 1000 and 3000 stones.</p>
  
  <p><strong>2. Make sure your stone is flat</strong></p>
  
  <p>You want a flat stone so that the angle between your knife and stone
  is stye same along the entire length of the stone. If your stone has a
  curve in it, get it flattened first. If there is a noticeable curve,
  ask a professional to flatten it. After this, maintaining a flat stone
  is easy.</p>
  
  <p><strong>3. Decide your angle</strong></p>
  
  <p>Usually 15-20 degrees. I find the Japanese knives are usually at
  around 15 degrees and European knives are around 20 degrees based on a
  bit of trial and error. You'll know if your angle is too low since you
  won't make progress after a few strokes.</p>
  
  <p><strong>4. Holding the knife &amp; stroke</strong></p>
  
  <p>One hand on the handle (of course) holding the knife at the desired
  angle. The other hand, fingers on the flat of the blade. Wrists
  straight. The sharpening stroke is when the knife moves away from the
  edge.</p>
  
  <p>So if the edge is facing towards you, push into blade as you push your
  blade away but release the pressure as you pull the blade towards you.</p>
  
  <p>If the blade is facing away from you, push into the blade as you pull
  towards you and release as you push away.</p>
  
  <p>Make sure you maintain the same angle on both strokes and <strong>always use
  the entire length of the the stone</strong>. If you only use part of the
  stone, that area wears away more quickly and you can't be sure of the
  angle.</p>
  
  <p><strong>5. Sharpening</strong></p>
  
  <p>Start with the coarsest stone. Pick a side, say edge facing towards
  you. I start at the tip of my knives. The tip is usually curved, so
  your hand position changes slightly. After a few strokes, move down
  the edge and take a few stokes. Keep doing this until you have done
  the entire edge applying water as needed.</p>
  
  <p>Now pick up the knife. On the side that is not being sharpened, run a
  thumb or finger across the flat of knife from the spine to the edge.
  On the edge, you should feel a burr. When you can feel the burr along
  the entire length of the edge, that side is done, otherwise it needs
  more work. Now sharpen the other side until you can feel the burr on
  the other side. We'll address a complete lack of burr later.</p>

<pre><code> _  &lt;- Burr
  \
  /\  
 /  \
 |  | Just sharpened side
 |  | 
</code></pre>
  
  <p>Once you have done both sides, go up to your next stone and repeat. </p>
  
  <p>As the stones get finer, the size of the burr gets smaller and harder
  to feel. On a 3000 stone, it gets very fine. If you cannot feel it,
  wash the blade of any material that you removed. This can sometimes
  help you feel the burr. I also find that dry hands work better than
  wet hands when trying to detect the burr.</p>
  
  <p><strong>6. Finishing</strong></p>
  
  <p>When you get to your final stone and have done both sides, you need to
  remove the burr. Just hold the knife at the same angle as you've been
  using with the burr side in contact with the stone, and pull the edge
  of your knife across it to remove the burr.</p>
  
  <p>You can also strop your blade, but it is not necessary.</p>
  
  <p><strong>7. Reflatten your stone</strong></p>
  
  <p>You can do this with a special flattening stone, or a bit of very fine
  sandpaper. I wet some 600 grit sand paper and put it on my bench
  (flattest surface in my home). Then sand the stone down. It only needs
  a few strokes if you do this regularly.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Don't feel a burr trouble shooting</strong></p>
  
  <p>If you have been working at if for a while and cannot feel the burr
  here are a couple of suggestions.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Wrong angle</strong></p>
  
  <p>Your angle may be too low. Increase the angle slightly and try again.
  On a coarse stone, you should be able to feel the burr after only a
  few strokes.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Knife is too blunt</strong></p>
  
  <p>Detecting the burr only works if the knife is close to being sharp. If
  it is too blunt, you need to remove a lot of material before you are
  close to a sharp edge again. Don't do this. If you do, you'll end up
  with an asymmetrical edge.</p>

<pre><code>  _            
 / \                                      /\
/   \  Keep working one side and you get /  \
|   |                                    |   \
</code></pre>
  
  <p>Instead, give a few strokes across the entire length of one side. Flip
  it over and do the other side. Make sure you do a similar amount of
  work so that the edge is symmetrical. The idea is to try and meet in
  the middle. Check after working each side and eventually you will get
  a burr.</p>

"How does one dry clothes in humid weather?","16773","","<p>What are some quick ways to dry clothes in moist weather?</p>
","<h2>Humidity</h2>

<p>Keeping clothing dry in normal weather can be challenging, but high humidity or precipitation regions can make this even more difficult. </p>

<p>That's because humidity is really a ""<strong>relative</strong>"" measure and means the amount of water vapor that the air can hold at a given temperature before condensation. </p>

<p>The condensation can occur in the sky as rain, near the ground as fog, or in your tent as water droplets clinging to the inside. The water can also cling to your clothes, if they hang inside your tent when the relative humidity approaches the ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dew_point"">dew point</a>"" </p>

<h2>Dew Point</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <strong>dew point</strong> is the temperature to which a given parcel of humid air must be cooled, at constant barometric pressure, for water vapor to condense into liquid water. The condensed water is called dew when it forms on a solid surface. The dew point is a saturation temperature.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is important because if you try to dry your clothes in the open air and the temp and humidity are near the dew point your clothes will not dry, if fact they may become more wet!</p>

<p>Many people have seen this when they get up to hike early and there is water clinging to tall grass along the trail even though there was <strong>no rain</strong>. </p>

<h2>So then how do I dry my clothes?</h2>

<p><br>
The nice thing about dew point is that it's totally dependent on the temperature of the air. As the air temp goes up, so does the amount of water it can hold.</p>

<p>The easiest way to increase the air temperature is to use your body, it is a constant 98-99 degrees and you always have it with you.</p>

<h2>So I am a human clothes line?</h2>

<p><br>
Not exactly. Most likely on a long trip you brought a sleeping bag and in that sleeping bag at some point be your body. The air in the sleeping bag will be higher than the ambient temperature, and overnight your clothes will dry.</p>

<p><strong>Below are the basic instructions for a sleeping bag clothes dryer.</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Start by using a relatively dry sleeping bag.</li>
<li>Wear a light set of polyester or other synthetic fabric base layer, which should be <strong>very</strong> lightweight.
<ul>
<li>These will wick the moisture and sweat away from your body.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Get into your sleeping bag and lay your clothing (wrung dry) on top of your legs and torso.
<ul>
<li>Tie socks together and place around your neck</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Zip up the sleeping bag and try to fall asleep. Through the night, reposition the clothes on your body.</li>
<li>After the clothes are dry, place them at your feet.
<ul>
<li>They will dry quite fast, usually within 3-4 hours. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Add another layer of moist clothes if you have them.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 3-5</li>
</ol>

<h2>Suggestions for keeping clothes dry.</h2>

<p><br></p>

<ol>
<li>Keep a lightweight water proof bag to put your dry clothes in during travel.
<ul>
<li>There are waterproof breathable bags which pack down tight and work great for this.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you have a sunny dry day, hike with the clothes tied to your backpack.</li>
<li>If you have lots of people in the tent with you (2-3) try making a drying line inside the tent.
<ul>
<li>Remember to provide for <strong>plenty</strong> of ventilation by opening the rain fly slightly to allow for air flow.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If the temp is lower (50 Deg F) but the humidity high, place clothes around your neck or torso while hiking. 
<ul>
<li>They can partially, or fully dry this way throughout the day.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h2>Other suggestions</h2>

<ul>
<li>Boots are hard to dry when wet.
<ul>
<li>Some people put mini synthetic towels in them to absorb some water, then pop them in the sleeping bag over night too.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Open the zipper by your feet (if you have one), to allow for the moist warm air to escape.
<ul>
<li>This also keeps your sleeping bag dryer, and warmer as a result.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You can also put the clothes on top of the sleeping bag, but my experience has shown this to be less effective.</li>
<li>There will likely be some condensation on your sleeping bag in the morning. 
<ul>
<li>Make sure to dry this off with a towel before it gets into the loft when you repack the bag.</li>
</ul></li>

"How does water depth affect swimming safety? Why do signs, especially in the UK, say ""DANGER: deep water""?","16738","","<p>In many UK lakes, I see signs prohibiting swimming with the explanation <em>DANGER: Deep water</em>.  <a href=""http://www.river-swimming.co.uk/legal.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">This link contains an example</a>.  I don't understand those signs.  Why is a 30 metre deep lake more dangerous to swimmers than a shallow 3 metre deep lake?</p>

<p>Is it because deep lakes may be colder (which depends on mixing)?  Currents (should be less, not more)?</p>

<p>Or does it <em>really</em> just mean <em>If you can't swim, you may drown</em>?</p>

<p><sup>Perhaps they're referring to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraken"" rel=""noreferrer"">Kraken</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nessie"" rel=""noreferrer"">Nessie</a>, or other flesh-eating critters living in unseen depths?</sup></p>
","<p>Well, there's the obvious issue that the bottom may shelve very steeply, so that non-swimmers trying to paddle may drown.</p>

<p>Beyond that, I think there's a specific point and a more general point.</p>

<p>Specifically, deep water is more dangerous in terms of <a href=""http://completeguide.rnli.org/cold-water-shock.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">cold water shock</a>.</p>

<p>In the first 3-5 minutes after entering cold water there can be a gasp reflex or muscle spasms that might cause intake of water into the lungs. Also, blood pressure and heart rate are raised, which can cause heart problems or stroke.</p>

<p>Deep water will remain colder than shallow water. And if the swimmer gets into trouble, they will likely be out of their depth. Also, as has been pointed out in the comments, the banks will often be steep and harder to exit.</p>

<p>The accidents tend to happen to young men with a macho approach to cold water. According to RoSPA (The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cold water shock can be prevented by people getting in slowly and
  acclimatising themselves to the water</p>
  
  <p>But many of these young men tend to jump in and swim out 50 metres
  (150ft). All of a sudden, cold water shock kicks in.</p>
  
  <p>It has nothing to do with how strong a swimmer you are - if you look
  at triathletes, they wear wetsuits to protect themselves against the
  shock of the water.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More generally, it seems that Local Authorities are increasingly taking a US-style legally defensive attitude to any risky activity. Increasingly their reflex is simply to ban swimming to cover themselves.  So from this perspective the notice may simply be an excuse for a ban. Here's the response of an official to an Outdoor Swimming Society petition for access to a lake:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Only if the Outdoor Swimming Society can strictly control and manage swimming on the lake, including providing and paying for the appropriate signage, safety measures, public liability insurance and cover of lifeguarding facilities all year round - and this council can be satisfied that all the necessary safety precautions are put in place and be indemnified against any incidents that may occur - will the council reconsider its position.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good grief - talk about over the top! This was in a lake where sailing and canoeing were allowed, and the Society was asking why swimming had been singled out. This prejudice against outdoor swimming seems to be an English thing - you don't see it so much in Scotland or the Continent.</p>

<p>So what are they going to ban next - sea bathing, perhaps?</p>

<p><strong>Cross-loading</strong> is shown in the middle figure below.  Strength in this orientation should be marked on the carabiner with a left-right arrow symbol.</p>

<p>The gate is a load-bearing member even when the carabiner is correctly loaded, therefore the ""open gate"" strength is much less, as should be marked with a symbol that looks like an open carabiner.  Be aware that the inward gate strength is usually much less than the outward cross-load gate strength because only the locking sleeve holds the gate in place.</p>

<p>There is another weakness you need to be aware of: loading the carabiner at a point or direction away from the spine.  This happens in ""tri-axial"" loading seen in the rightmost figure, or with <a href=""http://blackdiamondequipment.com/en/experience-story?cid=qc-lab-weakness-of-nosehooked-carabiners"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a nose-hooked carabiner</a>.  This is or can be even weaker than the cross-loaded configuration.</p>

<p>Here is another instance of tri-axial loading (<a href=""http://alpineinstitute.blogspot.com/2010/11/triaxal-loading-on-trees.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">source</a>).  This is probably not as weak as a carabiner loaded the same way but upside down, because the offset-D has a shorter lever arm in this configuration, <em>but it is still weak</em>:</p>

<p>Likewise a carabiner loaded with multiple ropes, or a single rope with a bulky knot, <em>even if loaded in the same and proper direction</em> will be weaker on the strand(s) farther from the spine.

"Pros and cons of Tent vs bivvy bag","16552","","<p>Tent vs bivvy bag - different camping experience, protection from the elements, comfort and weight? What are the pros and cons of both? Is it even a valid comparison - e.g. is it viable to rely on multi-day camping if you only have a bivvy bag or on the contrary does it make it easier to find somewhere to sleep?</p>
","<p>Tents, tarps, and bivvy sacks are three different specialized tools for three different jobs.</p>

<h2>Tarp</h2>

<p>I typically prefer a tarp to either a tent or a bivvy sack, but that's because I do most of my camping in California in the summer, when the weather tends to be quite dry. In summer in the Sierra, I usually bring a tarp but sleep in the open and never take the tarp out of my pack. A tarp is easiest to set up if you have trees, and works best if there is no wind. Setting up a tarp takes some skill and practice. In a wind, it's hard to keep a tarp from flapping noisily and keeping you awake. The great thing about tarps is that they can be so compact and light. My tarp is 6.5 oz (180 g).</p>

<h2>Tent</h2>

<p>If I know that a trip is going to involve snow camping, I'd prefer a tent. Some people prefer tents to tarps for summer camping because they keep bugs out, but what works well for me in mosquito season is to sleep in a headnet until the air gets cold enough that the bugs become inactive. Expensive ultralight summer tents can be almost as light and compact as a tarp. </p>

<h2>Bivvy sack</h2>

<p>If I'm planning to do a climb in snow in a single day, but want a safety net in case I need to camp, I might bring a bivvy sack as a more compact and lightweight alternative to bringing a tent that I don't expect to use. I have one and have brought it as an emergency tool, but have never slept in it. I have talked to quite a few people who have used bivvy sacks, and none of them ever had anything good to say about spending a night in one. Everybody complains about condensation building up inside the sack, leaving you sleeping in a pool of water. Bivvy sacks vary a lot in weight. Mine is 8.5 oz (240 g), but I've seen others that are as much as 39 oz (1100 g), which seems absurd to me since you could get a tent that weighs the same amount.</p>

"Is it ok to wear hiking shoes on street conditions?","16288","","<p>I want to buy some comfortable shoes to wear while going to work. I have to walk 4 km every day. I want to use these shoes on rainy (not too heavy) days too. I am looking for shoes for all weather conditions (except heavy rain and snow) that are comfortable for walking.</p>

<p>I have found some shoes but they say ""WaterProof Hiking Shoes"" and I am curious about whether it is OK to wear these kinds of shoes in an office environment or asphalt streets. Do they have any disadvantages on clear surfaces?</p>
","<p>Concerning using hiking shoes on asphalt: it certainly can be done and is a much better option than the other way around (i.e. taking a business shoe on a mountain hike). Hiking shoes are a bit stiffer in their construction and might have a little less damping in their sole which <em>can</em> make them a bit uncomfortable to walk on longer asphalt stretches but this shouldn't be a problem for such short pieces that you intend to do. However, if you decide to stick to a hiking boot, I would try to stay with rather light ones as you won't necessarily need features like ankle support and stuff like that. You could also have a look into the category of so-called ""approach shoes"" which are a bit lighter but may also be more or less waterproof.</p>

<p>Concerning the question about wearing them in an office environment, that depends on the office environment and the dress code there. A professor at my university is often seen wearing his cycling shoes that he uses for cycling to work and nobody cares. Other environments might have more restrictive guidelines concerning clothes and shoes.</p>

"Do iodine water treatment tablets have negative effects?","16279","","<p>I've heard that iodine water treatment tablets can have negative side effects.  </p>

<p><em>Is this true?</em></p>

<p>If so, what are some healthier alternatives?</p>
","<p>Via <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-35-IODINE.aspx?activeIngredientId=35&amp;activeIngredientName=IODINE"">WebMD</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Large amounts or long-term use of iodine are <strong>possibly unsafe</strong>. Adults should avoid prolonged use of doses higher than 1100 mcg per day (the upper tolerable limit, UL) without proper medical supervision.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However I seriously question that 1100 mcg number because people in Northern Japan have been found to consume <strong><a href=""http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/minerals/iodine/"">over 80,000 mcg per day</a></strong> due to a diet high in sealife (mainly seaweed) and they appear to be living just fine.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Pregnancy and breast-feeding</strong>: Iodine is <strong>likely safe</strong> when taken by mouth in recommended amounts. Do not take more than 1100 mcg of iodine per day if you are over 18 years old; do not take more than 900 mcg of iodine per day if you are 14 to 18 years old. Higher intake might cause thyroid problems. The topical product (2% solution) is <strong>likely safe</strong> for use on the skin.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Autoimmune thyroid disease</strong>: People with autoimmune thyroid disease may be especially sensitive to the harmful side effects of iodine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's clearly an issue if you are allergic to iodine.</p>

<p>If you already have a thyroid condition, too much iodine can complicate treatment.</p>

<p>Okay, so here goes:</p>

<p>Purification guidelines are 0.5 mg/L.  Let's assume you need four liters per day (someone can comment a better guideline for water quantity, but I normally drink about four per day when hiking)</p>

<p>2 milligrams = 2000 micrograms.  So yeah, that would exceed the 1100 UL dosage limit.  However if you consider the people of northern Japan to be evidence that the real limit is much higher, then you are in no danger from this dosage.</p>

<p>A note on all of this:  Everything I can find (CDC, webmd, etc) falls along the lines of ""<em>It's probably safe, but we're not sure and it <strong>may</strong> cause these issues</em>"".  </p>

<p>You're extremely unlikely to manage to poison yourself unless you just nom the tablets (a couple thousand of them).  Poisoning <a href=""http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/minerals/iodine/"">occurs in grams</a>, several orders of magnitude more than what is used to purify water.  To poison yourself, you'd need to consume ~2000L of iodine purified water in a short period, at which point iodine is no longer your primary concern.</p>

  <p>Once you have a solid grip, pull the legs with your strong hand, push your thumb down and pull the chin up as quickly and firmly as you can.

"What is the best way to store my sleeping bag for long periods of time?","15870","","<p>I've heard that storing a sleeping bag in its stuff sack for long periods of time will cause it to lose loft, and won't provide as much comfort or warmth when used again.</p>

<p>If so, how should I store my sleeping bag when I won't be using it for months at a time?</p>
","<p>Some sleeping bags come with a larger sack which does not unnecessarily compress the sleeping bag.

"How long will worms last in the refrigerator?","15848","","<p>So, my two kids are old enough to go fishing and have fun, but they get bored after an hour or so.  I purchased some worms from a local shop, and at our rate of fishing, it's going to take a while to use them up. I was told they were pretty fresh, and they apparently came from Canada (and boy are their arms tired...). The worms are packed in a small (6""x6""x2"") Styrofoam box that seems to seal itself pretty well.  They are packed in dirt, and they seem pretty happy when I open the container.</p>

<p>How long can I expect them to last in the fridge?  Is a typical home refrigerator (33-35 degrees) too cold?  They were in a cooler at the bait shop, but I have no idea how cold it was.</p>

<p>Is there anything I can do to make the little guys more comfortable?  How do I know when they are ""expiring""?  I guess they just quit moving, but are there other signs that it's probably time to git rid of them?</p>
","<p>The worms that you more than likely have are what most people know as ""nightcrawlers"".  They should be larger than regular earthworms, lively when touched, and ""juicy"" (lots of crud comes out when you cut them up).  In my experience, nightcrawlers are VERY resilient, given that you always do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Anytime they are not being used for fishing they should be stored in the refrigerator.  I always put them on the top shelf to make sure that they don't accidentally freeze.</li>
<li>They should always be in a slightly moist environment.  When storing, the fridge should be totally fine.  When transporting, I usually just make sure there is ample dirt in the container which helps to hold the moisture.</li>
</ul>

<p>As long as you do these two things I have found that most brands of nightcrawlers will last MONTHS.  You may notice that after a few hours of fishing, your worms will begin to get floppy and less active.  This is not a big deal as long as you can get the worms immediately back into the fridge after fishing (max of about 6 hours out of the fridge at a time), I have found they will rebound and be totally fishable after a few hours in the coolbox.  </p>

<p>One thing I usually do is only take the amount of worms that I think I'll need for my fishing session out of the container and leave the rest in the fridge. (old Chinese food takeout containers work very well, provided you wash them out) making sure to add some dirt into my travel container as well.</p>

<p>It is not clear from your question, but if there are no holes in the container I would poke a few to help the worms breathe.  </p>

<p>As far as knowing when they have died, it should be pretty obvious.  They will stop moving and start to dry up and shrink.  Depending on the conditions, white fungus might start to form as well.</p>

"Are mittens warmer than gloves?","15786","","<p>Given a mitten and a glove (made of the same materials, thickness, etc), is the mitten warmer than the glove?</p>

<p>It seems to me that having all four fingers together in one area (vs separate fingers for gloves) would make it so.</p>
","<p>Gloves or Mittens?</p>

<p>All things being equal (fabrics, thickness, and insulation), mittens are warmer than gloves. Mitts trap body heat by keeping your fingers together and reducing evaporative heat loss. In frigid temperatures, a layered mitt system is the best choice for warmth. Layers dry faster than one heavily insulated piece, and let you swap out wet layers. However, gloves offer better grip and dexterity for fiddling with ice screws and ski bindings. Wearing a shell outer glove and a thin polypro or Windstopper® liner is a good compromise. Your hands will retain some warmth even when you have to remove your outer gloves or mitts.</p>

<p>Tip: In wet, cold conditions, carry a spare pair of gloves or mittens in the inside pocket of your jacket. This ensures you always have warm, dry handwear to put on when your fingers get really cold.</p>

"Why do people who backpack sleep in tents instead of tarps?","15684","","<p>I know that this has been debated for some time (whether it is better to sleep in a tent or a tarp) but recently this debate came up between my friends and me, and I am just feeling out this possible discussion to get more exposure from people who are in the know. </p>

<p>I assume that people who go backpacking because they want to “be one with nature” and escape life. So why do so many backpackers use enclosed tents instead of open tarp systems (which I use and favor). Is it because tents are easier to feel that you are more protected from weather, insects and even wildlife (at least, that is what my friends’ claim, which I don’t buy)?  </p>

<p>In all fairness, I grew-up using a tarp system since I was around 5 years old because my Dad was an ultralight backpacker; that is, I had no choice. That being said, I’ve used tarps in rain, snow and insects, and I have always felt protected enough because I have the experience behind me. Now that I am 20 years old, I feel that a “walled tent” keeps me away from raw nature. </p>

<p>I am curious to see what other opinions think otherwise and are concise and clear about their choice of a tent.</p>
","<p>I think you pretty much covered it.</p>

<p>Advantages of a tent:</p>

<ul>
<li>Keeps more rain/snow out (particularly if you have little skill in tent/tarp setup)</li>
<li>Keeps out insects.  For me, this is the big one - in spring time when the mosquitoes are fierce, being confined to your sleeping bag with a net over your face is not nearly as pleasant as lounging in your enclosed tents.</li>
<li>Warmer (this one is somewhat debatable, but on a a windy cold day, perhaps less.  I know that square tarps let you pitch them to the wind... but winds shift)</li>
<li>Usually easier to setup, especially for novices</li>
<li>Privacy.  Tents are usually very enclosed, so in a busy area, you can change without needing to bury yourself in your sleeping bag.</li>
</ul>

<p>Advantages of a tarp:</p>

<ul>
<li>closer to nature, as you said</li>
<li>lighter (I can't stress this one enough!)</li>
</ul>

<p>I think though, you're forgetting that for lots of people, it's the hiking that's the pleasure, not necessarily the tenting.  So the ""being close to nature"" happens all day and into the evening by a fire.  Not necessarily while sleeping.  I agree that it is nice to be in nature (especially when you can just cowboy camp).</p>

<p>I also like a tarp with bug netting around the fringes, as it covers off the bugs issue.</p>

<p>I agree with you that a tent keeping you safe from wildlife is just wishful thinking :)  Perhaps for some people this is the equivalent for ""putting their head in the sand""... and if that's what it takes to get them out into nature, power to them!</p>

"What is the benefit to telemark skiing?","15627","","<p>Occasionally I've seen skiers free-heeling it down the slopes in telemark style but not understood why they do it. Is the main benefit for exercise, style, control or just to try something different?</p>
","<p>Telemark -- where the toe is attached, and the heel is free to rise up and down -- allow skiers to skin up back-country slopes with a more natural and efficient stride. However, AT (or randonee) rigs allow skiers that ability while doing alpine turns on the way down. </p>

<p>So, in this day and age, why do people <em>still</em> Telemark:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>A different way to enjoy the mountain</em>: The telemark turn is totally different form an alpine turn. The fluidity, the rise and fall, the total compression and release of the spring of your legs comes as close to flying as one can get and still be attached (at least part of the time) to the ground. </li>
<li><em>More stable knees</em>: from personal experience, since I started telemark, the knee pain I experienced chronically as an alpine skier has completely disappeared. I assume this is since my knees are bent in a position of stability, and my center of gravity is closer to the ski and ground during the hard-torque carving of a turn.</li>
<li><em>More athletic way to ski</em>: since you are essentially doing lunges down the mountain, your thighs, hamstrings, glutes, and core get an amazing workout.</li>
<li><em>A new challenge</em>: For me, after decades of alpine skiing, telemark offered (and continues to offer) a new challenge. (By comparison, I got board on snow-board after a few weekends, whereas telemark keeps me on my toes...) </li>
<li><em>Chicks dig guys who telemark</em>: and guys dig chicks who telemark. 'nuff said.</li>
<li><em>Style</em>: Watch expert telemark vs expert alpine skiers. To perfect an alpine turn is a skill. To perfect a telemark turn is an art.</li>
<li><em>Flow</em></li>
<li><em>Zen</em></li>
</ul>

<p>In short, yes to all points in your question. It is different, requires more control, has more room for style, and is a hell of workout. But beyond that, and beyond back-country access, it is pure, unadulterated, fun.</p>

","<p>With the bow it is not the speed of the arrow but the power it is packing. I think the general speed is around 300 fps (90 m/s). There are some compound bows that can shoot faster with thin diameter arrows. </p>

<p>Usually 55 lbs draw is enough to kill any large game. I shoot a 65 lb take down recurve when I train. Then I switch my bow limbs for 50 when I hunt (also train with it but not as much as with the 65).</p>

<p>If you take look at Hoyt website they have hunters taking down buffaloes with 50 lbs bows. </p>

<p>Also a lot depends on your arrow head and the diameter for the arrow. Thinner diameter penetrates deeper. Quality arrow head will slice up the heart so the animal bleeds out in matter of seconds. </p>

<p>Also it depends what you prefer to shoot. Some guys like longbows because of the feel and raw power. But it takes a long time to master.</p>

<p>Most people shoot recurves because they are easy to start with and are affordable. Also the bow generally does not vibrate as much as a longbow.</p>

<p>Then you have compound bows. I don't like them very much. Too much tech and at some point you're just better off with a rifle IMHO.</p>

<p>I know how to do it with two ropes, rope ascenders and on top rope, but is there a way to do it without?</p>
","<hr>

<h1>Advanced climbers only</h1>

<p><i>Climbing is inherently dangerous. Soloing is even more so. Please learn from experienced people and <em>in person</em>, not from Internet. So this answer mainly describes physical principles, supported by <em>some</em> experience that I have. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhAww0CI-Gw"">Here</a> is an excellent tutorial, by a climber more experienced than me, that explains the technique in much more detail.</i></p>

<hr>

<p>There is a belay device, <a href=""http://www.rockclimbing.com/gear/Essential_Equipment/Belay_Devices_Descenders/Soloist_602.html"">Soloist</a>, designed specifically for roped soloing. However, soloing is also possible with the usual <a href=""http://www.rockclimbing.com/gear/Essential_Equipment/Belay_Devices_Descenders/Grigri_2_Belay_Device_13330.html"">grigri</a> device. To add to the general warning on the danger of soloing, let me note that using grigri for this purpose is <a href=""http://www.petzl.com/en/outdoor/grigri-experience#GE-autoassurage"">prohibited</a> by the manufacturer (however, it's possible and some people do it).</p>

<p>First, anchor one end of the rope. If you fall, this anchor will be pulled <em>up</em>, so take this into account when building it.</p>

<p>Then, grab the rope a few metres from the anchored point, and load it into your grigri. Give it a quick pull to verify that the grigri locks (if you loaded it the wrong way, it won't).</p>

<p>Arrange the rope (starting from the other end) on the floor to make sure you can pull it up, and it will not get tangled when unsupervised (while you are climbing). (Note: it's better to stuff it into a backback to eliminate the chance of it getting stuck, but I don't know how to do it properly)</p>

<p>Start climbing the usual way, placing protection regularly. While climbing, feed rope through the grigri when you have the need and opportunity to do so. With grigri, feeding the rope is especially awkward and may require both hands; some people ""mod"" their grigri by drilling a hole to ease that process.</p>

<p>You will have two strands of rope going down; you should pay attention and clip only the right one (the one that is anchored).</p>

<p>You should avoid coming to the awkward situation when the rope stops you from climbing further (grigri ""thinks"" that you fell and locks). If a difficult section is ahead, where you cannot afford fiddling around with the rope, you should feed yourself enough rope to pass all of it.</p>

<p>When you arrive to the end of a pitch, build an anchor (might want to make it so it can support upward loading direction, to serve for next pitch), descend to the previous anchor, collect the protection gear and climb back up, using the top-rope technique.</p>

<p>Things that can go bad when soloing:</p>

<ul>
<li>You fall; grigri gets tangled or stuck in something, and doesn't lock. Some people tie knots in the rope to mitigate this risk.</li>
<li>You fall; since you have no partner, dynamic belaying is impossible, and protection points/anchors are loaded too hard, so they break away.</li>
<li>You fall; since you have no partner, grigri pinches the rope hard, damaging it to the point it is unusable. Now you must bail from the route using this damaged rope.</li>
<li>A rock falls on you, bruising your arm. Now you must bail from the route with a damaged arm, with no one to help you.</li>

<p>You could also double check that you're setting up your tent in a site that will be less likely to have water running along the ground in a heavy rainstorm.</p>

"Numbers on down jackets","15409","","<p>I'm looking for a down jacket. They all seem to come with numbers but I'm not sure what they mean. For example :</p>

<ul>
<li>90/10 Down</li>
<li>Fill Power 700</li>
</ul>

<p>What do they mean?</p>
","<p>They are basically measures for the quality of the down fill.</p>

<p>The 90/10 part refers to the mixture of down and feathers. As down contains nearly no rigid structure, one adds some amount of feathers to give the whole filling some more stability. The example of 90/10 means 90% down, 10% feathers and seems to be quite a typical mixture. I'm not sure about the exact numbers, but mixtures worse than 80/20 or so would give significantly worse insulation.</p>

<p>The fill power, often with the unit <em>cuin</em> or <em>cubic inch per ounce</em>, defines, how good the downs regain their loft after compression. To test this, an ounce of the respective down is compressed in a cylinder for 24 hours. After release of the pressure the volume that the downs regained is measured in cubic inches. Good down for outdoor clothing typically has a fill power of at least 650 to 700 cuin, very good (but also very expensive) products reach fill powers up to 900.</p>

"Transfer data from Suunto Ambit2 without Movelink","14972","","<p>I am testing my new Suunto Ambit2. Great watch! I like the way it can be configured and the analysis of the data! However, I am a little bit surprised to see that the software solution from Suunto only works with an internet connection. </p>

<p>Is it possible to get the data stored in the watch during a training when the computer is not connected to internet? Especially the waypoint from the GPS chip would be interesting for me. </p>

<p>Thank you. </p>
","<p>According to everything I have found on the web and experienced with my own watch, the watch will not register as mass storage so that you could access the recorded logs directly. Therefore you cannot just plug the watch to a random computer and copy he logs like it was a USB thumb drive.</p>

<p>But, there's at least some help:</p>

<h3>Computers running on Windows or MacOS</h3>

<p>What you can do is use <em>Moveslink</em> offline, i.e. you don't have to connect it to the <em>Movescount</em> online service at all or if you have temporarily no internet connection. In this case <em>Moveslink</em> will save the logs locally until it is connected to <em>Movescount</em> in a proprietary <code>xml</code> encoded file. This file by itself won't be of great use in the first place but some nice people already have written <a href=""https://github.com/montant/ambit2gpx"" rel=""nofollow"">a tool to convert</a> the logs to a <code>gpx</code> file. I haven't tried it myself but if I read the documented options right you can choose to just export the GPS positions or other (heart rate etc.) data. The logs are stored in the following location (cited from a no longer available Readme file of the tool mentioned above):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When transfering data with moveslink, an xml file is stored on computer. On Windows, it can be found on locations such as:</p>
  
  <p><code>C:\Documents and Settings\'username'\Application Data\Suunto\Moveslink2</code> (on Windows XP)
    <code>C:\Documents and Settings\'username'\AppData\Roaming\Suunto\Moveslink2</code> (on Windows 7) </p>
  
  <p>Pay attention to the fact these 'Application Data'/'AppData' folders are hidden by default as they are 'system folders'. Change settings of Windows explorer if you want to make them visible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For Windows versions newer than Windows 7 I would try the Windows 7 path, but I can't check since I don't have such a system running here. On a Mac, the path is <code>/Users/&lt;user&gt;/Library/Application Support/Suunto/Moveslink2</code></p>

<h3>Linux computers</h3>

<p>If you are a Linux user and able to follow some console commands to compile the source code yourself, there's a project called <a href=""http://openambit.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">openambit</a>. The authors have dissected at least enough of the communication protocol to allow to download moves from the watch and (optionally) upload them to movescount. They also ship the conversion script mentioned earlier in my post, but at the moment you would have to invoke this manually to convert your moves to <code>gpx</code> files.</p>

<h3>TL;DR</h3>

<p>So to conclude the the information above: You can use <em>Moveslink</em> or <em>openambit</em> offline to download the logs from the watch and there's a tool to convert the files to <code>gpx</code> format. But you will need a computer where you are able to install these tools, therefore you won't be able to use any random computer unless you have the ability and/or permission to install the needed software there.</p>

"Is it really a good workout to go to work by bike every day?","14819","","<h2>Foreword:</h2>

<p>I know there is a bicycle SE where this question may belong, but it is more about the training factor for other outdoor hobbies than about cycling itself. Cycling could theoretically be replaced with another endurance sport even if that is unlikely. </p>

<h2>My Background:</h2>

<p>I have suffered from a knee injury (with surgery) over the last 1½ years and I also will be having more surgery (ankle) in about a month. Next year, when I'm done recovering, and my body is working as intended without any limitations, I want to get back into sports climbing and hiking/mountaineering. As endurance training for those hobbies, I thought it would be great to cycle to work every day (has lot of other benefits too). I live 18km away form my workplace which means about an hour of cycling twice a day.</p>

<h2>Actual Question:</h2>

<p>I don't know any book/website/youtube-channel that suggests training for more than 3-4 consecutive days, as your muscles need time to recover. Having this in mind, is it really a good idea to cycle to work every day for >45 mins (one way) from a training perspective? What also strengthens my thoughts is that when I want to do some kind of outdoor or sports activity on the evening or at the weekend my body needs to ""do work"" for multiple hours at least 6 days per week. </p>
","<p>There's a technicality here that's about the difference between ""training"" and ""being active"". It's important not to confuse the two but where the threshold lies is a matter for an individual.</p>

<p>For the first few weeks, cycle commuting will be training. Subsequent to that, assuming you're not the type to cycle at full sprint everywhere, it's simply a part of an active lifestyle. It goes along with walking to the shops instead of driving, and using the stairs instead of the elevator.</p>

"Why do so many people hike with such light footwear?","14719","","<p>More and more, I see people hiking with very light-weight shoes.  To me, they look like regular sport shoes and they look to be lacking thick soles, waterproofness, or ankle support.  I thought this was a US phenomenon, but I saw that in two UK outdoor stores I visited, most shoes sold are such.  For example, a recent trip to Southern Utah, I partly hiked on popular trails in Zion National Park, such as the trail to Scout Lookout/Angels Landing and the trail to Observation Point.  Both trails include serious slopes where classical hiking boots (see picture below) would appear essential to me, yet I saw hundreds of people who hiked in lightweight shoes that looked unsuitable to me.  I observed the same in Bryce Canyon National Park, where a park newspaper lists improper footwear in a top-10 of injury causes as cause #3, #2 and #1. I did not notice this phenomenon on more remote trails or in other countries such as Norway, Sweden, Spain, Switzerland, where outdoor stores sell hiking boots rather than city shoes.</p>

<p>Why do so many people hike in serious mountains with light-weight footwear?  Is it an active choice?  I've tried sport shoesonce or twice for a short distance, and it was painful — I can't understand that someone would hike anything that isn't flat tarmac in such shoes.  They wouldn't keep my feet dry beyond the first stream crossing, either.</p>

<p>By a proper hiking boot, I mean something like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AVRlV.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AVRlV.jpg"" alt=""light sport shoe""></a></p>

<p>In Scandinavia, many people I meet hike in even higher boots, arguing they are more suitable to keep the feet dry.  I imagine that to be true, but I've never tried hiking in them and I don't think I've seen people using them outside Scandinavia:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uqV50.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uqV50.jpg"" alt=""Swedish boot""></a></p>

<p>Do people actively choose hiking in lighter shoes (perhaps part of the American <em>ultralight</em> fashion?), or is it simply a matter of unpreparedness?</p>

<p>(See also: <em><a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/q/5695/566"">What is the point of hiking boots, versus any comfortable walking shoes?</a></em>)</p>
","<p>Hmm - more of a tirade than a question, but let's assume you sincerely want to learn. There's a good deal of ground to cover, so please bear with me here...</p>

<p><strong>First, technical trail shoes are not ""city shoes""</strong></p>

<p>If we're going to have an intelligent conversation we need to clear this up from the outset. You describe all types of lightweight footwear as ""city shoes"". This is an unhelpful caricature. While street shoes are obviously inappropriate for tough walking, technical trail and approach shoes are designed specifically to provide the grip and robustness required for this type of terrain. </p>

<p><strong>Second - lightweight walkers are not simply unprepared fashion victims</strong></p>

<p>We have to put this in proper context. You imply that anyone using lightweight footwear on difficult ground is simply unprepared or following a mindless trend. In fact, you'll find that the more experienced the walker, the more likely that they will be choosing to use lightweight footwear.</p>

<p>I've been walking the hills for half a century. I've used every kind of footwear, and in almost all conditions I now have a strong preference for trail shoes. And I'm far from alone. Pretty much every experienced through-hiker is now using lightweight footwear, even on quite technical off-trail work like the Sierra High Route. In fact, I challenge you to find a single well-known long-distance walker using the kind of boot you are advocating.</p>

<p>So there are two possibilities. Either the entire community of long-distance walkers is experiencing some kind of collective delusion, or they know something that you are missing...</p>

<p><strong>Third - the traditional case for heavy walking boots doesn't stand up to scrutiny</strong></p>

<p>The specific claims you make for heavy footwear are that it protects the ankles and keeps the feet dry. </p>

<p>But where is your evidence that heavy boots protect the ankles? I can't find any actual research that's remotely convincing. To provide meaningful ankle support, a boot has to be so rigid that it's virtually impossible to walk in the thing. In reality, a walking boot, as against a technical ice boot, provides insignificant ankle support when laced for comfort. On the other hand the high stack height, stiff sole and poor ground feel disrupt natural walking mechanics and leave you clumsy and unstable. I experienced a number of serious ankle injuries in conventional boots. Since I switched to lightweight trail shoes I've never had a problem, and I do a lot of rough off-trail walking. </p>

<p>As for the idea that big boots keep the feet dry, I don't know many real walkers who'd agree. Your feet sweat, and heavy boots don't breathe. But the membranes in so-called breathable waterproof boots quickly break down and leak. And with any practical summer gaiter, water is going to penetrate through the gap at the ankle. Once they are wet, the type of boot you are advocating becomes even heavier and takes an age to dry. </p>

<p>The great majority of long-distance walkers simply accept that their feet will get wet at times. They chose shoes that drain well and dry quickly, and wear merino socks that are warm when wet. On balance, this is much the most successful approach.</p>

<p><strong>Most long-distance walkers agree that the benefits of lightweight footwear greatly outweigh the disadvantages</strong></p>

<p>The real disadvantage of lightweight trail shoes is economic - you're going to be replacing them after every 500 miles or so of heavy use. On every other dimension, they are a much better choice than the old leather monsters that you are advocating.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Trail shoes are far more energy efficient</strong>: research shows that a pound on the feet is equivalent to at least 5 lbs on the back. And on steep rough ground, that's probably an underestimate (the research was done on treadmills). Lightweight shoes are far less tiring to walk in, and you'll be significantly less prone to lower-body strain injuries.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trail shoes are far kinder on the feet</strong>: I've walked thousands of miles in trail shoes and never had a hot spot, never mind a blister. When I walked in big boots I had endless problems with blisters and bruising. Search Google Images for ""hiking blisters"" and you'll see <em>graphic evidence of the misery big boots can cause:</em></p></li>

  <p> <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rXFRT.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rXFRT.png"" alt=""blistered bleeding feet""></a></p>
</blockquote>

<ol start=""3"">
<li><p><strong>Trail shoes are far more nimble</strong>: you'll be significantly more balanced and less liable to fall. Falls in remote country can be serious, so this is a big deal.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trail shoes are far better for stream crossings</strong>. Stream crossings with big boots are a major faff. With trails shoes you just walk straight across. Your feet are grippy and protected during the crossing, and the shoes soon drain on the trail.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As I say, the more experienced the walker, the more likely that they will chose lightweight shoes. And this will be a considered choice based on many thousands of miles of practical experience. You're welcome to choose the footwear you prefer - that's the freedom of the hills. But please keep an open mind and don't denigrate those who make other choices.</p>

"Canadian Law with respect to knives","14171","","<p>I keep seeing slightly different answers for some of these questions.</p>

<p>In summary of what I know already, please tell me if I am wrong.</p>

<p>You can own any knife of any length, with the following general exceptions: </p>

<ol>
<li>It is stereotypically related to gang violence (like the auto/easy opening variety).  </li>
<li>It is designed to be concealed. (I do not really care about the specifics, as I personally am not interested in any knives like either of these)</li>
</ol>

<p>You can carry around anything that is legal to own, but there is a length restriction for concealed knives? Do you need a lawful reason to carry it, in either situation?</p>

<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Self defense is not a lawful reason to carry a knife. Does this mean that if I end up defending myself (from an animal or a human) that it is unlawful to use a knife? Do they just not want you carrying one around just for this reason since pepper-spray would be better?  </p>

<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> I am rather leery of this ""lawful reason clause"". Is just general survival/cutting of things a good enough excuse?<br>
It just does not really make sense to me. A knife is designed to cut things, and I carry one around to cut things with.  </p>

<p><strong>Question 3:</strong> So it is lawful to carry around, in full view, any length of blade? What is the restriction for concealed knives (I have heard numbers from 4"" to 6"")?  </p>

<p><strong>Question 4:</strong> What is classified as ""carrying"", exactly? Does that mean that I cannot transport a big knife in a backpack or bag? What is required for transporting big knives so that police will not call it concealing?  </p>

<p>Specific situation: I really want to get a big-medium sized Kukri as a general survival knife that works well as a replacement hatchet. It is 100% a tool, but it looks like an intimidating sword. So this Kukri is not something that can really ever be carried around in plain view in public; it would attract too much attention. It is specifically related to the ""how do I transport a large knife in public"" Question 4.</p>

<p>But I also like a smallish utility knife. I am thinking of getting a small Bowie within that range (4""-6""). So the exact length requirement is important.</p>
","<p>Canada does not really have any hard and fast rules, with regard to knives. Specifically, except for lists of a few specifically banned styles they do not even mention them. And something that must be kept at the top of your mind at all times is that a knife is not necessarily a weapon.</p>

<p>There are specific lists and descriptions, but suffice it to say you cannot own any gang knifes of knifes designed to be concealed. Specifically, knives that have easy/auto opening abilities are, for the most part, banned or a legal gray area.</p>

<p>The letter of the law pretty much allows you to carry any blade of any size anywhere, as long as you are not going to commit a crime with it, but if it could be considered a weapon it cannot be concealed. Not concealed is a matter of perspective as well; are you transporting your knife in your backpack, or are you concealing it; It depends on the circumstances and the perspective.</p>

<p>In real life cops do not like knives that are too big or too scary looking. If they think you having that knife is dangerous to the public good they will take it away from you, at the very least. I have heard numbers up to 6 inch as being the maximum allowed, but some cops will have a problem with far smaller knifes. It is all about where you are, what you look like, what you are doing, and does the knife look like a tool or a weapon.</p>

<p>Also it is important to know that, while I was completely unable to find any law pertaining to this, Canadian law enforcement do not allow the carrying of self defensive objects. If they believe your knife is for self defence, or you tell them it is, supposedly it will be taken away. The criminal code seems to specifically allow defensive weapons, but I am no law expert. If you happen to have a knife handy for a different reason (non self-defensive reason), and can prove that, you can use it when in danger of your life from an assailant.</p>

"How to light a fire with wet firewood?","13723","","<p>There is a wide variety of pre-cut firewood available when camping. In my experience, even wood that's been kept covered is often very wet and can be difficult to light.</p>

<p>What are some techniques for lighting wet firewood?</p>

<p>Are there ways to tell wet pre-cut firewood from wood that's only damp on the outside?</p>
","<p>I'm from British Columbia; lots of BC is technically a rain forest, which pretty much means you're always starting your fire with wet wood. </p>

<p>The trick to getting wet wood to light is to generate a lot of heat when you first start your fire - that means using <strong>lots of extra kindling</strong>. Cut triple or quadruple the amount of <strong><em>fine</em> kindling</strong> and build yourself a thick teepee with a good amount of tinder to get it started. Regardless of how wet a log feels on the outside, if you split it open, the centre will be relatively dry, so use that for your tinder and smaller kindling. </p>

<p>When you build your fire with lots of wood it's easy to smother your tinder, you need good airflow with wet wood, so make sure it can breathe. Your goal is to get a lot of flame as soon as you light it; this flash of heat will help you get some hot coals quicker, which will dry out the rest of the wood. Completely build your fire before you light it; this helps the fire grow faster once it's lit. You risk your fire burning out if you try to light your tinder first then build it up after it's lit.</p>

<p>To help keep your fire going, stack your fuel wood around the fire like a wind screen; they'll catch a lot of the heat off of your fire and dry out a bit before you need to use them. </p>

"Is there a difference in performance between a fishing kayak and touring kayak?","13682","","<p>Last year my wife and I rented a couple of SOT kayaks and used them to paddle around our local lake. We enjoyed it so much we have decided to purchase our own this year.
We are looking at some entry level kayaks to use at the lakes and rivers here in Illinois. 
I am also an avid fisherman and I would like to get a fishing kayak but I don't know if there is a difference, performance wise, between a fishing kayak and a touring/recreational kayak. I don't want to struggle to keep up with my wife if we decide to kayak for 4 to 5 hours on a river or lake.
Would I be able to use a fishing kayak like a regular touring/recreation kayak?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","<p>Yes, there is definitely a performance difference between different types of kayaks. In fact, there are performance differences among the same types of kayaks. For example, a 14-foot kayak will always track more straightly than a 10-foot kayak. A wide recreational kayak will always have more primary stability than a narrower touring kayak.</p>

<p>Even if you both get the same type of kayak I suspect you'll find they work differently for each of you. No doubt you both do not weigh the same -- if you're heavier, a given kayak will sit lower in the water than for her. That may result in increased stability, or it could mean that you capsize easily. Alternatively, consider height and armspan: if she's short she may find it difficult to paddle in a wide rec kayak where the paddle is constantly bumping the edge of the boat.</p>

<p>In short: you should each look for a kayak that suits you. That means you will see performance differences between the two kayaks, but if the boats really do suit each of you, that won't be a problem because you've found something that fits well. As to a fishing kayak specifically, if you get a longer kayak than her you'll likely be able to keep up with her on a day trip (though at the expense of maneuverability).</p>

<p>Of course, keeping up with a partner is about more than the just the kayak. The paddle will also make a difference (especially its weight as it relates to your fatigue), and paddling technique can be a big difference between feeling good at the end of an outing and feeling whipped.</p>

<p>Bicycle helmets are designed for a SINGLE ground impact.  Like modern cars they are designed to crumple and absorb the energy from an impact.  They probably provide the best protection of any type of helmet because of this design.  Once they've had an impact they are now completely useless though.  This is not a big deal after a bike accident as you can probably stop riding the bike and walk or get a ride home.</p>

<p>Climbing helmets on the other hand are designed for multiple impacts.  They do not absorb impact energy like a bicycle helmet but they can provide protection even after an impact.  This is important when you're climbing because unlike biking you can't always stop climbing just because you've had an accident.  You've got to complete your ascent or return to the ground.  Additionally, most head injuries from climbing are not from the climber falling but rather from rocks falling on their heads from above.</p>

<p>So imagine you've worn your bike helmet to climb and managed to bang your head on the wall.  The bike helmet is crumpled now and will provide no protection now.  Suddenly some rocks fall from above.  You would be severely injured as the bike helmet would not absorb the impacts or even deflect very well at this point.</p>

<p>Added 5/28/12</p>

<p>You can't really compare the standards as they are for different activities and requirements.  As stated above the cycling helmet standards do not require multiple impacts.  EN climbing helmet testing is done under EN 12492: 2000 and these tests require multiple impacts to the helmet.  Specifically a 5kg hemispherical striker is dropped at 30 and 120 degrees (from the horizontal plane) on the top of the helmet from a height of 2 meters.  A flat 5kg striker is then hit on the front, sides, and rear of the helmet.  There are also penetration tests done.</p>

<p>The maximum force that can be transferred to the head 10kN.  So climbing helmets are not designed to absorb as much of an impact.  They are designed for multiple impacts of smaller force instead.</p>

<p>I am not as familiar with bicycling helmet standards, just that their design does not require multiple impacts.  If you've ever seen a cycling helmet after a ground impact you can see clearly it would not provide protection for a second impact.  Rather, they are designed to absorb much higher levels of force by crumpling.  CPSC standards permit only 3kN of force to be transferred to the head.  I'm not sure what weight and how they test this though.</p>

<p>So the short version is that a cycling helmet must not transfer more than 3kN of force while a climbing helmet may transfer up to 10kN.</p>

<p>There are many more standards setting bodies for cycling helmets as well.  I only used the CPSC because it's the most common one on the market.  Snell has a much more stringent standard.</p>

<p>I have seen some of the foam climbing helmets but I'm not sure what the design theory is behind them.  I suppose they would absorb more impact from any single impact.  Once the foam has been impacted it would not provide that level of absorption again though.  The shell of the helmet would still need to meet the multiple impact requirements to be approved by EN.</p>

<p>The other issue is that most cycling helmets have fairly wide ventilation slits.  These are far to large for climbing and could easily allow falling rocks to penetrate to the head.</p>

<p>There are now some multi-sport helmets on the market but these are intended for climbing, canyoneering, and kayaking/rafting.  Cycling and motoring helmets will always require higher absorption levels because higher speeds (and thus force) are involved.</p>

"What exercises should you do before a ski trip to build leg stamina?","13517","","<p>I'm planning to go skiing this winter, having not been for a few years. I remember that in the past, the first few days often ended up being cut a little short as my legs were aching too much from the unaccustomed muscle use. This time I expect it'll be even worse, given how long since I last went skiing.</p>

<p>Are there any exercises I can do in advance to help build up the leg muscles used in skiing? I'm OK on general fitness, I'd just like to do some leg muscle prep if possible in advance, so I can make the most of the trip!</p>
","<p>Skiing is a full-body, high endurance, activity. Being in good cardio-vascular shape is important, and can be achieved through running, swimming, rowing, etc... This can not be over-emphasized. Get your heart in shape.</p>

<p>Assuming you already are in decent shape, here are some exercises that will help you get through those initial days on the hill. I've chosen exercises that require no additional weight -- your body and gravity provide all the resistance you need. (Some can be enhanced by holding light weights if so desired.)</p>

<p><em>--Leg Strengthening--</em></p>

<p><strong>Wall squats:</strong> Sit with your back against a wall, your feet together on the ground, and your knees bent at a 90 degree angle. Hold for increasing amounts of time. As strength increases, raise one leg at a time horizontal out in front of you. Repeating multiple reps of 30 seconds to a minute. Feel the burn.</p>

<p><strong>Lunges:</strong> Take a large step, dropping your back knee to the ground while bending your front knee (try to keep the front knee at a 90 degree angle). Return to standing, repeat for other leg forward. Do 50 steps or more.</p>

<p><strong>One legged speed squats:</strong> Stand with 90% weight on one leg, and 10% on the other. Squat down and stand up as rapidly as you feel comfortable for 20-40 reps. Repeat other side.</p>

<p><strong>Plyometrics:</strong> If you are already in good general shape, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plyometrics"">plyometrics</a> will amp up your legs into bomber ski shape**. Simple moves like:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>jump-squats: lower into a squatting position, feet shoulder width apart, then explode up through standing and jump. Return to squat    position.</p></li>
<li><p>standing three-direction jumps: stand upright, feet together. Jump    up, twisting your lower body so your feet now point to the right, but    shoulders point forward. Jump back to center, then left. Right -Center -Left -Center  -Right. Imagine the snow-flocked pine trees whipping by your face.</p></li>
<li><p>High knee jumps (Jump knee-tucks): Stand upright. Keeping your torso at the same    height, jump your knees up toward your chest repeatedly. (Legs come    up, body stays the same).</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>--Core strength--</em> </p>

<p>Your core is also super-important. Skiing (done right) requires a lot of twisting (shoulders stay pointing downhill while your lower body carves back and forth.)</p>

<p><strong>Crunches, sit-ups, side presses</strong>, etc are all super-helpful and common exercises, so I won't explain them. A new one I've added to my repetoire (thanks P90X!) is <strong>""Mason Twists"" aka Russian Twists:</strong> Sit with your back straight and your legs elevated in front of you so your body makes a V feet at chest level. Clasp your hands. Rotate your torso, and hit the ground on the left side with both hands. Rotate your torso to hit the ground on the right side with both hands. Go back and forth, side-to-side for 40-50 reps in rapid succession.</p>

<p><em>--Balance and static strength--</em></p>

<p>Skiing is a balance sport. Knowing how your body moves, how it is centered, and how your body responds is important. Consider various <strong>yoga</strong> moves:</p>

<p><strong>Warrior 1,2 and 3:</strong> I won't try to describe them here, since they are easy to do wrong. I recommend seeking a yoga class in your area. But the warriors are GREAT for strengthening your knees (common ski injury areas) and learning balance.</p>

<p><strong>Tree Pose:</strong> The ultimate balance posture. In its simplest form, stand with good posture on one leg for as long as you can.</p>

<p>A regular yoga practice will help in all areas of fitness.</p>

<p>*<strong>*NOTE:</strong> Higher-impact exercises like plyometrics can cause injury if done improperly. Land softly when you jump. Do not attempt unless you are in good physical condition. If in doubt, consult a health-care professional. </p>

"When hiking, why is the right of way given to people going up?","13188","","<p>When you're in a path and you encounter another group going the other way, it is said that whoever is going down should stand aside to let those going up pass through. Why?</p>
","<p>There are three good reasons for this: </p>

<ol>
<li>The harder work an uphill hiker has to do</li>
<li>The smaller field of vision of an uphill hiker</li>
<li>They are in that ""hiking rhythm"" zone which shouldn't be interrupted (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertia"" rel=""noreferrer"">Inertia</a>)</li>
</ol>

<p>This paragraph contains everything you need to know:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And most important and most ignored, everything else being equal, give
  the right of way to the hiker going uphill!</p>
  
  <p>Why the latter? Think about how most people hike - usually focused
  downward, a few feet ahead on the trail, watching their footing to try
  to avoid a face plant. If you're headed downhill, you'll generally see
  some distance ahead of you on the trail at the same time as you're
  looking down to where you will set your feet the next step or two.
  You'll see any hiker coming up hill well in advance of meeting. On the
  other hand, if you're hiking uphill, and looking down at the trail,
  your range of vision is really just a few feet in front of you.
  Clearly the hiker going downhill has the visual advantage, and time,
  to adjust his position so the uphill hiker can pass. And, it's a lot
  easier for the downhill hiker to stop and resume than it is for the
  uphill hiker. Think about the interstate trucker or you on a bike - it
  takes more energy and time to restore speed if starting from a dead
  stop. So it is with the uphill hiker, especially if carrying a
  backpack - let her come on through so she can benefit from the ""body
  in motion"" principle in physics. This applies to hikers running
  downhill too. And just because you're running downhill (nobody is
  impressed anyway, and secretly hoping you face plant) that doesn't
  give you the right of way.</p>

  <p>It seems that many hikers—even experienced ones—may not know or always

"What are the dangers of walking barefoot in towns/cities?","13151","","<p>I've walked barefoot practically all summer for every summer I can remember. However now that I'm a teenager my Mum is saying I need to wear shoes because of glass, needles, worms and diseases. I have done some research but no answer is super clear as to ""What are the dangers of barefoot walking?""</p>

<p>I have stepped on tiny pieces of glass that have penetrated (and were tricky to dig out) as wells as bigger shards that didn't get through, and I have burned and blistered my feet out of my stubbornness. So, what are other relevant dangers of walking barefoot in a small town of Canada?</p>
","<p>My family walks around barefoot all the time, not just in the summer.  We used to live in Santa Clara County, California, but now live in Humboldt County of the same state.  We've never had any serious problems and I would not discourage from doing this but there are several disadvantages:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>By far the biggest disadvantage is that you will <a href=""https://letsgobarefoot.wordpress.com/2014/12/20/no-shirt-no-shoes-no-service-where-did-it-come-from/"" rel=""noreferrer"">face significant judgment and discrimination</a>.  While walking barefoot you people will move to the other side of the street, sneer, shout things like ""get some shoes"", etc.  Not everyone does this and outright aggression happens a lot more to the young women in my family than to me (I'm kinda big, they are really small), but it's a pretty serious concern.  This doesn't just apply to strangers on the street, either-- expect to be refused service at many grocery stores, restaurants, and other places of business.  Even public places in the wealthier parts of towns often have security that will lie to and threaten you to get/force you to leave if you are not wearing shoes.  With regard to businesses, you will be told that ""It's against the Health Code for us to allow customers without shoes in the bulding"".  That's, like, the number 1 reason given when they kick you out.  It's also not true (the Health Code prohibits employees from not wearing shoes in certain occupations in certain regions, but neither area I have lived in have forbidden customers from not wearing shoes).  Anyways, the harassment can be a real bother; be ready for it.</p></li>
<li><p>In the snow, it gets really cold.  During the winter, sometimes it snows.  Walking in the snow barefoot is alright for a little bit if your feet are used to it, but you risk frostbite if you're out long.  If there's snow and ice on the ground, you should wear shoes or limit your time outside.</p></li>
<li><p>Feet washing is still important if you walk around barefoot.  On the plus side, you are much less likely to get most common foot diseases and your feet will smell nice because they aren't in a moist, sweaty, warm, dark environment all the time.  On the downside, your feet won't start to smell bad so you might not wash them as thoroughly as you otherwise would.  Basically, just remember to wash.</p></li>
<li><p>The other barefoot issue is that if you step in something gross with shoes you can take your shoes off before entering the house and washing them. I find that it's far more difficult to take my foot off before entering the house! Avoid walking in terrain where you can't see what you're stepping on/in.  This applies to things like tall grass and dense ferns or ivy.  Since you can't see, you have no way to prevent yourself from stepping in something gross, like animal poop, or even something dangerous, like trash.  This actually applies even when you are wearing shoes-- walking through such things damages the plants involved (less meaningfully in the case of grass) and exposes you to wild animal related risks like <a href=""https://canlyme.com/lyme-prevention/risk-areas/"" rel=""noreferrer"">ticks</a>.  It may still be worth it to you, at various points in time, to partake in barefoot activities in grassy or otherwise groundcovered areas, but you should try to be aware of the risks and decide on a case by case basis. Personally, walking through tall grass barefoot makes me uncomfortable, so I don't do it unless I absolutely have to.  No one in my family <em>routinely</em> walks through areas where you can't see what you're stepping in, so, while we haven't had any problems with this besides the occasional, really-gross-but-harmless stepping-in-dog-poop accident, I can't really speak to an overall risk assessment for your off-trail barefoot walking habits.  On-trail and on streets in town you should be able to avoid doing this.</p></li>
<li><p>This doesn't apply to you at all, since you've been doing this for years, but if you haven't walked around barefoot before you may not be aware that it hurts.  Concrete is rough and hard and will sand down your skin, which means that, until you build up callouses, your feet will start to hurt after walking around for just a bit.  As your feet get tougher, it hurts less or not at all, but there's always more terrain that your feet will need to adapt to.  Pine needle mats hurt until your feet get tough (then they can feel good instead-- very squishy XD ), gravel hurts always even with crazy rediculous feet (as far as I'm aware), concrete will always hurt if you walk on it long enough to sand down the callouses, but at some point that's no longer a feasible amount of time to walk.  This isn't a danger, though, so much as it is unpleasant, unless you end up needing to run away from something else dangerous while barefoot and don't have enough callouses yet to support that.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Broken glass, nails, needles, etc are not real problems.  We've never had any serious issues with that.  It's true the streets are dirty sometimes, but you don't go tromping around in the gutter or over broken glass barefoot, and it's not like you end up doing those things on accident.  The danger of that sort of thing happening is exaggerated in the minds of the community, possibly to disguise their more classist motivations for discriminating against the lack of shoes from themselves (see problem with walking barefoot #1).</p>

","<p>Get them lost.</p>

<p>Basically you want to get them out to where they lose their bearings, and then as a group, get them to find their way home.  Good acting helps.  If you can pretend you are <em>also</em> lost then they get the mental experience.  This is a great way to teach people how to deal with really being lost.</p>

<p>There are a couple of key points here, and the first is that <em>you</em> know the area, can navigate, and plan this in advance.  If you have a second adult who can respond to emergency signals (blown whistles, etc) that is even better.</p>

<p>Step 1 - Get them lost.  This can be trickier than it sounds.  A ""trail run"" can be a great method, especially if you aren't actually on a trail.  However, a good conversation will often do the trick just as well.  The key is to trick them into not paying attention.</p>

<p>Step 2 - Reveal that you have ""lost track of the turns"".  Solicit the group to get you home.</p>

<p>It is important that you are always there for safety.  You must always know the way back.  Don't let them get you lost trying to find camp.  Give them enough support so that they can succeed as a group.  </p>

"Is it safe to fire 38 caliber rounds in a 357 magnum pistol?","13066","","<p>I have a .357 revolver.  The rounds have a significant amount of kick.  When I go out target shooting the kick makes it unpleasant to shoot before I have gone through a full box of ammunition. </p>

<p>Someone told me you can fire 38 caliber rounds in a 357, but I am not sure that is a good idea. Is it safe to fire 38 caliber rounds in a 357 magnum pistol?</p>
","<p>Absolutely safe.  The .357 Magnum cartridge was literally designed as a high-pressure .38 Special:</p>

<ul>
<li>Max pressure on a .38 Special is 17kpsi (with the +P specification allowing for 18.5kpsi).</li>
<li>Max pressure on a .357 Magnum is basically double: 35kpsi.</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to prevent people from putting the high-pressure rounds in a gun not designed for them, the cartridge case was lengthened just enough (0.135"") that, properly loaded, it would not fit in the cylinder or chamber of a gun designed only for .38 Special.  But take a .357 Magnum round, dump a bit of powder* (or use the same charge as you load in .38 Special), and you're essentially back to a .38 Special in a slightly longer case.</p>

<p>Shooting .38 Specials in a .357 Magnum can lead to one small problem: Because the .38 case is slightly shorter, you'll get chamber or cylinder fouling a little further back.  If you shoot a lot of dirty ammo and then, without cleaning, try to feed .357 Magnum back into the same gun, you might find rounds getting stuck on that ring of fouling.</p>

<p>Another tiny caveat: There are some .357 Magnum autoloaders out there.  If they're tuned for the recoil impulse of the magnum they may fail to cycle on the lower recoil of the .38 Special.  Of course, as with any gun you intend to use for hunting or defense, you should test fire the gun with the ammo you intend to carry to ensure they work together without malfunctions before taking them into the field.</p>

"When should I use spray-on versus wash-in waterproofer for treating DWR garments?","13065","","<p>There are both spray-on and wash-in products available for treating my DWR (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durable_water_repellent"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Durable Water Repellent</a>), gore-tex, eVent and other garments using products such as nikwax wash-in or nikwax tx-direct.  What types of garments is it more appropriate to use spray-on versus wash-in on and vice versa?</p>
","<p>After considering the existing answers and doing some additional research, here's my take:</p>

<p><strong>Spray-on waterproofing</strong> 
Spray on waterproofing should be used on Multi layer garments. You only want to treat the outer layer which reduces the chance that it will be 'wetting out' quickly, which allows the inner membrane to maintain it's porous properties.  I've found many references for gore-tex which state ""We do not recommend wash-in treatments, as they can hinder your garment’s breathability."" </p>

<p><strong>Wash-In waterproofing</strong>
Ideal for Single Layer waterproof or water resistant DWR fabrics. Probably great for your tent's rainfly, cheap rain shell pants, or your single layer packable windbreaker.  Not so good for your multi-layer gore-tex jacket. Though, you could probably use the spray-on coating for these type of materials as well with little difference in final result.  So, if in doubt, I'd use the spray-on.</p>

<p>Either way, you should keep your garments clean to ensure that body oils and sweat deposits don't clog the pores in the breathable membranes. Most breathable garments recommend using a detergent free tech wash that won't wash away the DWR treatment.  </p>

<p>This doesn't make sense to me, if the charcoal is so great, and all that the rocks and sand bring to the party is dirt, why not just fill the bottle with all charcoal? Not to mention that charcoal is much easier to come by than various grains of sand in a forest or a jungle or whatever.</p>

"Pitching a tent in the rain?","12841","","<p>So I've had the complete and utter luck of never having had to pitch my tent in the rain.</p>

<p>However, with needing to pitch it this weekend and the high probability of rain and potential thunderstorms (I might add, British thunderstorms, so rather tame and mostly lasting 15-30 minutes maximum so we should be able to avoid that) and going to Wales in a few weeks where there is more chance of rain, I was wondering if there were any particular DOs and DON'Ts in regards to pitching in the wet. There will be two of us pitching the tent this weekend, four in Wales.</p>

<p>I know this will vary slightly depending on what tent people have. I happen to have a 4 man tent (Eurohike Sandringham) it has an outer layer, a hanging inner sleeping area with its own attached groundsheet and a separate bucket groundsheet for the other area - so technically it comes in three parts. There are at least a dozen guy ropes, and more tent pegs than I can count, and we have plenty spare.</p>

<p>I would guess there is a case of more haste less speed, but is there anything one should completely avoid when pitching in the wet, or on the other hand something that one definitely should do?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Some people have mentioned 'crawling about' - this won't be an issue in this particular case because of the sheer size of a Eurohike Sandringham - you can stand upright easily, and we can fit our Ford Focus inside when just the outer layer is pitched. But the comments are good to know nonetheless as we won't always have such a big tent! We plan to get a Vango Halo 300 in the future which is much smaller.</p>

<p>I accepted the answer I felt most relevant to my personal situation, however all give brilliant advice to bear in mind in all locations / with all tent types!</p>
","<p>For tents that erect outer first, pitching in the rain is no different to any other time, just don't leave the dry inner out in the rain while putting the outer up. The outer will get wet on both sides anyway. </p>

<p>To make this easier a bit of forward planning is useful, like pack the inner and outer separately so that you can just leave the inner in the car until its needed.</p>

<p>Choose your spot carefully, ideally the lee side of a wall or natural windbreak, on shortish grass (relative to the depth of the tray in your groundsheet) that is slightly higher than the areas around it (avoid boggy and low lying areas where water will accumulate).</p>

<p>Large tents that erect outer first can be pretty floppy in high wind, so extra pegs and guys can be useful. If you have a geodesic tent with flexible poles a pole repair kit (a metal pole sleeve made from narrow pipe and duck tape) can be a life saver too.</p>

<p>Other Essential Kit (esp for Wales): 
Wet weather footwear, even if its not actually raining you'll be walking around a lot in wet grass. Go for total exclusion (wellies) or man up and go for total immersion (sandals). In summer months I prefer sandals as you can wear them when/if the sun shines as well. Outdoor sandals, made from fast drying man made materials are go anywhere footwear, great for paddling around in wet places.</p>

<p>I'd also recommend shorts, wet legs are far easier and quicker to deal with than wet trousers. Save your dry clothing for when you're inside.</p>

<p>Head torch, totally indispensable item, my single best purchase, ever! Try doing anything that requires two hands in the dark without one of these.</p>

<p>I've been camping and backpacking in the mountains in all weather and all seasons for 40+ years, these are hard won lessons.</p>

<p>Above all, a bit of adversity never hurt anyone, and next time you will go prepared.</p>

","<ol>
<li>Keep active.</li>
<li>Bring a good hat. While your body can reduce blood flow to fingers and toes to prevent the core from getting cold, for obvious reasons it doesn't want to reduce blood flow to your head. Thus, it's important to keep your head warm. </li>
<li>Eat sufficiently. Your body needs a lot of energy to stay warm. Don't deny it that energy. Mix food with readily available energy (simple carbohydrates: sugar. Chocolate is GREAT for this purpose) and food with slow-but-long-burning energy (fat. My outdoor club's former president mixes quite a lot of butter into his dinner, which he claims helps him stay warm throughout the night)</li>
<li>Before you go to bed, run a few circles around the campsite to get warm. It is much easier to keep warm inside a sleeping bag than it is to <em>get</em> warm inside a sleeping bag.</li>

"Why is it prohibited to sleep in a tent?","12611","","<p>In many European countries like Germany, it's prohibited to sleep in the great outdoors with a tent.</p>

<p>While I understand that downright camps are a problem due to littering, fire etc., I don't get why a tent is a problem. Like what's the difference anyway if one is sleeping in the open air and in the tent?</p>
","<p>The tent just makes your intent obvious: You planned to sleep there from the beginning. And this is what the authorities want to prevent: Camping in the wild. On the other hand many legislations allow for emergency and high altitude bivouacs, which are inevitable. So the gray area developed where people sleep without a tent in order to escape punishment, as they are just bivouacking. In popular climbing areas in Switzerland they also fine you for bivouacking, as an emergency is clearly not the case (usually people carry stoves and more food/drink than you would ""expedition style"").</p>

<p>So usually the distinction is planned/unplanned sleeping out in the wild, and often this has been adopted to sleeping with/without a tent, even though the two are certainly not equivalent.</p>

<p>Another reason why bivouac is favored over tent: Bivouacking is associated with trekking lightweight, in which case you do not take stuff to throw away (that would be useless weight). So the potential for littering is generally smaller in bivouacking.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> </p>

<p>Due to the interest this question has spawned and some comments, I informed myself about the laws here in <em>Switzerland</em> regarding this issue.</p>

<p>Somewhat surprisingly on a national level Switzerland knows a ""Jedermannsrecht"": Article 699 of the ZGB (civil law) states that access to forest and meadow within the locally common extent is allowed to everyone. Fishing and hunting is excluded from this and regulated on the level of ""Kantone"". This is even more explicit in article 14 of WaG (laws concerning forest): ""Kantone"" have to make sure that the public can access forests. Again restricted locally to preserve nature and events need approval from authorities. Of course this is restricted by further laws about conservation areas, but it should be common place that in any kind of conservation area (there are lots of different kinds around here...), you have to inform yourself whether its allowed or not and in doubt, you don't.  </p>

<p>So one might think ""Why all this fuss about whether you can camp or not in the wild, this says you can..."". The problem lies in the details, which in this case is the access up to ""locally common extent"". As Switzerland is based on federality, meaning very strong independence of the ""Kantone"" and of municipalities, they can basically all choose what they consider ""common extent"". So basically in Switzerland you either ask in every municipality whether you are allowed to or not or you adhere to commonplace rules and the so called eleventh law: Don't get caught. </p>

<p>Still I was not aware about the extent of legal backing for free access to woods around here: Basically you cannot fence any forest area even if you own it privately, as access to the public is granted (and walking through it is the basic kind of access, so you can't exclude it as ""locally uncommon""). I don't know whether this will help anyone, I just felt like writing it down.</p>

"Is there an organization for adults to learn outdoor skills with their kids?","12544","","<p>I had to tie down a tree last night since recent storms broke the guy lines I had placed when I planted it, and I used a tautline knot how-to I found online to tie it, since I was never a Scout. After reading a <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/10334/i-never-adjust-for-true-north-is-this-bad-practice#comment25083_10343"">comment by @KRyan</a> on <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/q/10334/3076"">a recent question</a>, and considering my recent face-to-face with my inexperience, I started lamenting the fact that I was never a Scout. Which got me thinking: <strong>is there an organization similar to the Boy Scouts for adults who want to learn outdoorsmanship?</strong></p>

Hence the OP.</p>
","<p>Volunteer in Search and Rescue (SAR).</p>

<p>I just got certified through my state's Sheriff's Association as a volunteer search and rescuer. I went through a two-month-long class with an intense outdoor ""final exam"" in order to get the certification.</p>

<p>Class topics included: tracking, outdoor clothing and equipment, wilderness navigation (map/compass/GPS), fire/water/shelter/signaling, environmental injuries, equine and canine resources, HAZMAT, crime scene investigations and evidence, lost subject behavior, CPR/AED certification, and yes, plenty of knots.</p>

<p>Now I volunteer in several local SAR groups, including a ground search group, an aircraft-based group, and an amateur radio emergency service.</p>

<p>Every person in these groups has unique skills, and without exception everyone has been friendly and interesting. One of the guys wants to be able to tie 150 knots... and he has a list of them and is working on it. If you want to geek out in depth on <em>any</em> outdoor subject, there is someone to do it with.</p>

"Knee pain when descending a mountain","12415","","<p>It's been said by a specialist doctor that any form of mountain descent would affect your knee caps. </p>

<p>Do old mountaineers have knee problems? Is it related to the way you descend?</p>
","<p><strong>I'll be sticking to the ""Descend and the Knee pain"" part of the discussion here.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>Yeah, there is no doubt that a descend definitely make a knee-pain worst. (I am strictly sticking to the point that its not <em>caused</em> solely by descending the mountain).</p>

<p>The intensity can vary person to person and that is depending upon habits one has developed over the time. <em>Habits</em> here refer to the speed of walking on a descend, Calcium-rich diet,  packing sense, load-carrying abilities, etc.</p>

<p>If you go to a physician, He/She will term this pain as as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chondromalacia_patellae"" rel=""nofollow"">Chondromalacia</a> or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patellofemoral_pain_syndrome"" rel=""nofollow"">Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome</a>. These are the most common types is pain around or behind the kneecaps, which is often diagnosed among not only trekkers, but in runners, skiers, and cyclists.  </p>

<p>I hope this makes one understand that its not only because of the <strong>Descend</strong>.
In a layman's language I'd say its there when you exert your knee, be it in a way with your driving as well sometimes.</p>

<p><strong>The weight/load that you carry, adds more strain to the knees. Period!</strong></p>

<p>A downhill walk with a heavy backpack is definitely a strenuous task for the knees. Its because anecdotal studies say that while descending with each step that you take, the amount of force exerted on you knees is roughly thrice the normal body weight.</p>

<p>The moment you find your knees hurting on a descend, try and keep a steady and a calm pace, need not to rush downhill, if you are carrying excess weight, make sure that the load is distributed in a well manner and see if your fellows can help you with the heavy backpack. Drink adequate water.</p>

<p>If you experience pain on the trail after a hard day of walking, bring along some Ibuprofen/Painkiller or may be some gel/oitment to reduce the pain and inflammation (if there is any) and stretch your quadriceps before you start again. You may also find that wearing a knee brace/cap is helpful.</p>

<ol>
<li>Never hike knee-locked down a steep decline! Walk at a steady, slow pace and keep the knees flexed. The faster you hike, the longer your stride tends to be, which intensifies the weight and impact to your knee.</li>
<li>Do not jump or take long strides: It kills the knee!</li>
<li>If time permits, pick a trail that goes in a zig-zag manner, sideways or s-shaped rather than going straight down hills whenever possible by making your own mini-switchbacks on wide trails.</li>
<li>If possible, plan hikes where the downhill is at the end of the journey rather than the beginning. This way you have consumed most of your food weight, cooking fuel, etc.
Dump unneeded water before heading downhill.</li>
<li>Wear the shoes that are of your shoe size and have good cushion for comfort.</li>
<li>In the long term, make sure your body is prepared for a hike with lots of downhill by doing exercises to strengthen the muscles around the knee, and hike or walk downhill regularly.</li>

"How do you safely cut wood with a knife?","12127","","<p>Several people have talked about having single edge knife so that you can cut down small trees.  What is the proper way to cut or carve wood with a knife?</p>
","<p>You really want a saw or camp axe for this purpose, but if using a knife you want one <em>without</em> serrations.  Serrations are not a replacement for a saw.  A saw cuts a kerf wider than the blade itself so it (with skill) doesn't jam.  Serrations are usually placed near the handle which is exactly where you don't want them because this is where you have the most leverage for a push cut.</p>

<p>Getting onto technique itself, here are a couple of videos that show how to use a small knife (not a chopper) better than I could in words.  If you have a proper fixed-bade you can use batoning which is a very powerful technique, but don't try it with a folder.  (If you <em>do</em> have to use it with a folder, such as splitting wood in an emergency, <em>unlock</em> the handle a small angle so that each hit is not destroying the lock.  This is dangerous and should not normally be attempted.)</p>

"Is it safe to use denatured alcohol as an antiseptic?","12092","","<p>A lot of hikers carry denatured alcohol for cooking.  Is there any risk to using it as an antiseptic for cuts and lacerations?</p>
","<p>No, it is not safe to use denatured alcohol for two good reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Denatured alcohol refers to a class of ethanol produced for <em>industrial uses</em> that has been ""<a href=""//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denaturation_%28food%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">denatured</a>,"" which essentially means ""made undrinkable"" by mixing other compounds that are <em>toxic or unpleasant to humans</em>. The thing is, you, as the consumer, have no idea what exactly was mixed in. Different denaturing agents have different skin toxicities, none of them are pleasant, and some of them are known mutagens. Many countries also require denatured alcohol to be dyed to help prevent accidental consumption.</p></li>
<li><p>Any modern wound management training <em>recommends against using alcohol</em> of any kind as an antiseptic. Although it does kill bacteria, pouring alcohol on a wound also kills perfectly healthy flesh which disrupts the healing process, can result in longer heal-times, and result in higher susceptibility to infection down the road.</p></li>

"What's the difference between frontcountry camping and backcountry camping?","12002","","<p>I know what <em>camping</em> is, but what are frontcountry and backcountry camping?</p>
","<p>Front country is a rarely used term; it would only be in contrast to backcountry. Backcountry camping means that you are not near the road or in a developed area. Typically sites can only be reached by foot or boat, often several hours of travel from any development. Facilities will range from absolutely nothing - camp where you like, try not to make a mess - to spartan - a sign on a tree, a ring of stones for a fire, a latrine pit with a wooden box on it. Your behaviour will typically be more restricted (eg no cans or bottles may be brought) than in a developed campground. </p>

<p>Front country camping is what I call car camping. There are sites with picnic tables, fireplaces, possibly grills, taps, central bathrooms with sinks, perhaps even flush toilets or showers, electricity, there might be a store or an office with a phone, and it's on a road so you can go out and get things if you need them.</p>

<p>Neither one of them matches festival camping, which is a farmers field full of tents with no real camping support (fireplaces, picnic tables) but plenty of event support (food stalls, entertainment.)</p>

"Canvas vs Nylon Tent for Car Camping","11788","","<p>I'm looking for some input to determine which type to camping tent I should purchase specifically for car camping.  I really like canvas tents as many of their features are very appealing but I know they do have a number of drawbacks.  Below is a summary of what I have found in my research.</p>

<h1>My Background</h1>

<p>I do not need this tent to be portable (i.e. carried long distances) as this is intended for week-long trips with the family when camping in a single location, most often (but not always) at developed campgrounds.  My only constraint is with the packed size as I'm currently driving a small crossover SUV which doesn't quite have the carrying capacity of a pickup truck.</p>

<h1>The Comparison</h1>

<h2>Canvas Tents</h2>

<h3>Pros:</h3>

<ol>
<li>Large - Lots of room internally with near vertical walls.</li>
<li>Waterproof - Easily maintained waterproofing using a product such as Kiwi Camp Dry.</li>
<li>Temperature - Cooler in summer and warmer in winter as compared to Nylon.</li>
<li>Durable - If well maintained (not put away wet, will last decades).</li>
<li>Repairable - Simple needle and tread can be used to make field repairs.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Cons:</h3>

<ol>
<li>Heavy - Thick (but durable) material and steel poles contribute significant weight.</li>
<li>Bulky - For similar reasons to #1, they take up a lot of space when stored.</li>
<li>Price - Substantially more expensive than Nylon counterparts.</li>
<li>Stinky - Can develop an odor that's borderline impossible to remove, particularly if ever stored wet.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Nylon Tents</h2>

<h3>Pros:</h3>

<ol>
<li>Weight - Very light, small tents are event backpack-able.</li>
<li>Price - Cheap enough to almost be disposable.  Large tents are not dirt cheap but are still 1/2 the price of their canvas counterparts.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Cons:</h3>

<ol>
<li>Not as durable - Waterproofing breaks down over time and seam leaks are difficult to repair.</li>
<li>Small - Large tents are almost (but not always) dome tents to take advantage of the small/lightweight curved fiberglass poles.</li>
<li>Temperature - Hot in summer and cold in winter.  Slightly invalidated for summer as only ""hot"" when the sun is shining and I'm not in the tent anyways.</li>
</ol>

<h1>My Use Case</h1>

<p>I'm leaning towards a Kodiak Canvas 9x12 cabin tent with a ground cloth and the attached screen porch option.  If anyone has any hands on experience with one of these tents specifically, I'm interested in how it stands up against the aforementioned points.</p>

<p>I elected for this specific model because the attached porch can optionally be setup or tied back to the main tent meaning that I could use it when no other screen rooms are available and we need a bug-free location for cooking and storing gear under a roof.</p>

<h1>The Real Questions</h1>

<ul>
<li>Can anyone offer some advice regarding their experience with the points in my comparison?  I've never stayed in a canvas tent so I am likely missing some important details.</li>
<li>Do you think that my decision to go with the large canvas tent is a wise one?</li>
</ul>
","<p>Is camping to you about the campsite or the outdoor activities?</p>

<p>You've addressed the significant points, but I think the issue can be reduced to two factors:</p>

<ul>
<li>Time required to set up and take down</li>
<li>Physical size</li>
</ul>

<p>Canvas will generally lose both due to the added bulk. So why use a canvas tent? As anyone familiar knows, they're amazing when you're inside them. The more hours you plan to spend in the tent awake, the more attractive canvas becomes as an option.</p>

<p>For short trips where the tent is primarily used for sleeping, they tend to be more of a hassle than they're worth. The longer you stay, or the more time you plan to spend inside, the less of an issue the time and bulk become. </p>

<p>That leaves trip duration as the deciding factor. 
How short of a stay is too short for canvas? Personally, I wouldn't set up a canvas tent for any stay that was less than three nights, and only then if it was a trip that revolved around the campsite. If it's an average trip with lots of daytime excursions, I wouldn't use canvas for anything under a week.</p>

<p>Oftentimes when I go camping with a larger group, one or two canvas wall tents will be set up as the living and dining areas for everyone, while synthetic dome tents will be used for separate sleeping quarters.</p>

<p>If camping is about the campsite, then go with a canvas tent, it'll make for a great experience and, if properly cared for, will last a lifetime. If camping is about outdoor activities, go with the synthetic dome tent and spend the extra money on other gear.</p>

"How many miles per hour can a person travel a day on foot?","11739","","<p>this is my first question.</p>

<p>I want to know how many miles can walk a person in different terrains. The terrains are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Flat (Prairie)</li>
<li>Snowy </li>
<li>Desertic </li>
<li>Boggy</li>
</ul>

<p>If a person have a backpack with some weight... How this weight affects his speed? How much it decrease?</p>
","<p>I hike a lot in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, and around here our 'book time' is based off of a book called the White Mountain Guide. It assumes that you will take half an hour for each horizontal mile and each 1,000 feet of elevation gain, so a 10 mile, 3,000 foot hike would take 6:30 by book time. </p>

<p>This number can be useful for planning purposes, but it should never be taken literally; I'm far from the fastest hiker around, but on a good day and a decent trail I could beat book time by 30%, and of course there are many who could go much quicker. On the other hand, someone not in great shape or taking things slow could easily take longer than the book predicts. So <strong>personal ability</strong> is a huge variable in that regard.</p>

<p><strong>Terrain</strong> also matters considerably- on a fairly flat trail, 3 mph is a reasonable speed (50% faster than predicted!). On a particularly steep or rocky trail, you slow down considerably. There are instances where taking a longer trail with the same elevation gain will actually be faster because of the ease of navigating. Even with the fairly constrained context of trails in this one region, the variance is huge.</p>

<p>And then we get to <strong>weather</strong>. Rain can definitely impede progress, but snow is the big kicker- if you end up postholing through thigh-deep snow, your speed could be well below 1 mph. On the other hand, if you have good traction and you're on a solid-packed trail, you can go faster than in the warm season (especially going downhill).</p>

<p>Basically what I'm saying is that there are way too many variables to give you a reasonable estimate. If you set Scott Jurek (recent AT record-setter) down in Kansas on a nice day, he could probably do 60+ miles and feel good about it. Put some average person in that same area in a whiteout snowstorm and they'd probably struggle to make it from their front porch to the mailbox. There's just no way to make an estimate with massively narrowing the scope of your question.</p>

But very little was about medical or first aid supplies (band-aids, gauze, tylenol, moleskin, etc).</p>

<p>What items would you consider essential to bring in a small first aid kit for injuries or health concerns that could come up during outdoor activities?</p>
","<p>Okay just broke out my kit.  Here's what we carry.  This may seem like a long list, but it's <em>small</em>.  It fits in a ziploc bag (almost).  Also, please note that you should pack for your skill set and first aid training.  If you don't know how to use a splint, it's wasted and will tempt you to do things you shouldn't.  Same goes for sutures.  Know how benedryl and the epipen work before you dose anyone.  You get the idea.</p>

<ul>
<li>Tylenol -- pain where ibuprofen is not ok (ie - patient is bleeding)</li>
<li>Ibuprofen -- pain that involves swelling but not bleeding</li>
<li>Small bandages -- comfort item and to help prevent infection on longer hikes</li>
<li>Triple Antibiotic -- reduce risk of infection</li>
<li>Iodine -- wound care, reduces risk of infection</li>
<li>Medical Tape -- close wounds</li>
<li>Gauze -- for use covering wounds and to stop bleeding</li>
<li>Latex Gloves -- They weigh nothing, sometimes you don't have time to wash (get nitrile if you or your hiking buddies have a latex allergy)</li>
<li>SAM Splint -- breaks and sprains, better than improvising one</li>
<li>Benedryl -- mild reactions</li>
<li>EpiPen -- serious reactions.  One of the few things you will <em>NOT</em> make it out of the woods with is an anaphylactic shock reaction without an epipen or something equally powerful.</li>
<li>Basic Suture stuff -- dire emergencies only</li>
<li>Quick Clot patch (antibacterial) -- slows/stops bad bleeds</li>
<li>Tick key -- hate those bugs</li>
<li>Butterfly bandages - medium cuts</li>
<li>Sudafed -- okay, this is just to handle my sinuses</li>
<li>Hydrocortizone -- soothes some stings, bites, etc.</li>
<li>Tweezers</li>
<li>Lip Balm -- Good for any kind of chapped skin, not just lips.  If your face is badly wind chapped, this can be a godsend.</li>
<li>Moleskin and 2nd Skin -- Moleskin is OK, but 2nd skin with a moleskin over it is unbeatable for blister treatment.  </li>
<li>Something for irrigation of deeper wounds (discovered the hard way that this is important)</li>
</ul>

<p>With the exception of the EpiPen and Splint, this all fits in a quart freezer bag and goes in the very top of my pack in a separate compartment.  We tell everyone where it is.</p>

<p>Everything is also sub-packaged into smaller (cheap) snack size ziplocks.  You don't want your gauze wet or contaminated because you needed a tylenol.  I also packed things together logically (for me).  Bandages, triple antibiotic, and iodine all into one ziploc.  Pills in little containers (packed with cotton so they won't break). </p>

<p>One tip for labeling your pills.  Use a sharpie then clear tape over the writing.  Sharpie will wipe off of most plastic containers in time.  We've never lost the writing this way.</p>

<p>With the EpiPen you will notice that I took a rubber band and attached the medial information sheet to it with all the instructions, warning, cautions, etc.</p>

<p>There's some more information in a <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/980/are-there-any-low-sodium-freeze-dried-meals/984#984"">different question</a> too.</p>

<p>At it's most basic, I've taken a ramen noodle pack, emptied it into a ziplock, then emptied the flavour pack in there too.  On the trail, boil 2 cups of water, throw it in the ziplock, zip it closed, and then wait 5-10 minutes.  If it's cold out, you might put the ziplock in your hat to keep it better insulated, or put it between layers of your clothes (bonus of keeping you warm while you wait!).</p>

<p>There's a couple downsides to freezer bag cooking:</p>

<ul>
<li>You essentially waste the bags, they aren't very reusable after you fill them with hot water</li>
<li>Sometimes the bags get little pinprick holes in them if you aren't careful (i.e. ramen can be sharp if it's crushed in your backpack).  So when you pour in the hot water, you get hot water everywhere!</li>
</ul>

<p>Good upsides though!</p>

<ul>
<li>Very little mess on the trail, just seal up the bag when you're done!</li>
<li>no cleaning dishes</li>
<li>fast and simple on trail</li>
<li>lightweight because all you need to do is boil water, you can use the lightest stoves - alcohol, esbit, or tiny canister stoves</li>

"What are the advantages of short climbers?","11234","","<p>My girlfriend often complains that a route or boulder was created for tall climbers. In my experience that sometimes is true: I easily get a hold, she has to jump. However, Lynn Hill proved that a small climber can achieve wonderful, unthinkable things. </p>

<p>When looking at mixed gender bouldering competitions in Germany (like described in the <em>Art and Science of Bouldering</em> by Udo Neumann)
girls easily manage the guys' problems, but with different techniques.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>What are the advantages of short climbers?</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>How should short climbers train to compensate for their shorter reach?</strong></p></li>
</ul>
","<p>As a disclaimer I'm 6'3"" so this isn't from experience!</p>

<p>As a tall climber you're correct, I have a lot of advantages. Reach can be very advantageous, especially on bouldering.</p>

<p>In my experience the <strong>disadvantages</strong> of me being tall (therefore the <strong>advantages of being shorter</strong>!) are:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have a longer reach but I also have longer levers. This means I
find certain power moves more difficult.</li>
<li>Taller people tend not to be as powerfully built as shorter climbers so again I'm maybe lacking in sheer strength (to weight) sometimes</li>
<li>I find close claustrophobic moves difficult. My elbows and knees can get in the way. Shorter climbers often find these moves easier as they are in more natural positions for them</li>
</ul>

<p>As a shorter climber you need to train for your advantages. So train for power moves. Use your lighter weight and shorter levers to perform dynamic moves. This also has the advantages of allowing you to reach the longer moves that you may struggle with.</p>

<p>Most important is technique. A climber with good technique will out climb any climber with worse technique, regardless of physical features. There are lots and lots of examples of brilliant short climbers The legend that is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Brown_(climber)"">Joe brown</a> was well known as a short powerfully built man. </p>

<p>I wouldn't say a shorter climber should train much different to a taller climber. A shorter climber will often simply need a different <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_(climbing)"">Beta</a> to a taller climber, i.e. a more dynamic move to reach the holds, different foot positions, etc.</p>

<p>I'm a firm believer that the best training is climbing. So stick at it. Try some dynamic jump moves and practice them, use this to help you out of sticky situations. Work on your grip strength (dead hangs, etc.) but I would recommend this to anyone climbing short or tall.</p>

<hr>

<h2>tl;dr</h2>

<p>I climb with a guy who's better than me. He's also a lot shorter than me. It really annoys him when I can just reach something that he can't. But 9 times out of 10 he'll climb stuff I can't. That is simply because he's better and height is almost irrelevant. So don't let height be a disadvantage. Keep practising and getting better and it will become less and less of an issue.</p>

"What foods are unsafe to cook over an open fire?","11167","","<p>My friends and I went camping this weekend and I bought a package of <a href=""http://www.johnsonville.com/lines/brats.html"">Johnsonville brats</a> to cook over the fire. Many a person said that one should 'never bring raw brats to cook over a campfire', their rationale being that raw brats are dangerous to eat because of the possibility of bacteria and/or undercooked meat, but <em>moreso than other types of raw meat</em>.</p>

<p>Specifically, if the brats are fully cooked (I checked, they were!), is there inherently more danger in brats vs other raw meats? Is it a 'pork thing'?</p>

<p>But more generally: assume that no external factors would make the food in question unsafe to eat (such as hot dogs being left out of a cooler - becoming a haven for bacteria, or woods that put off toxic smoke) - are there any foods that are simply <em>not a good idea</em> to cook over an open fire?</p>
","<p>Cooking raw brats over a fire is only dodgy because cooking brats well requires fairly precise (for a campfire) temperature control. Even with hot dogs, it can be a bit challenging to get the whole thing consistently cooked through without burning the outside. With a bratwurst, its larger size makes that especially difficult without some skill or tools.</p>

<p>If you are skilled and patient, you can however cook them over a fire, just like with anything else. However, because of the extra challenge, fully cooked brats and sausages are better. If your fully cooked brats you bought could be eaten right out of the cold package, then you should be fine.</p>

<p>As to pork vs other meats, pork was a bit more dangerous than beef because of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichinosis"">Trichinosis</a>, however to my knowledge in the developed world it is quite uncommon. This is probably why people in your group had that position. However, other common meats have plenty of other nasty critters in them, so it's debatable whether pork is actually any worse.</p>

<p>Much of the danger of a particular meat today is not so much the animal it comes from, but from its preparation. Even chicken meat can be consumed raw if the animal was well cared for and kept free of disease. However, unless you've sourced your meat from a world-class shop, assume it is crawling with dangerous microbes that must be eradicated via cooking, because it almost surely is.</p>

<p>Ultimately, all cooking involves the application of heat, so there is nothing that should not be cooked over a campfire, from a safety perspective. You'll just have to learn the techniques of campfire cooking and you'll be able to cook virtually anything. </p>

","<p>Eating berries and mushrooms is not recommended since there is no general pattern to identify poisonous ones (unless you're an expert on that topic). Even having a book with pictures of edible berries can be tricky as some poisonous ones are disguised as their edible counterparts.</p>

<li>Aid Climbing</li>
<li>Free Climbing</li>
<li>Free solo climbing</li>
</ul>
","<p>All of the above are styles of rock climbing. The differences/similarities are highlighted below:</p>

<h2>Bouldering</h2>

<ul>
<li>Low-level climbing (usually up to about 3m) without the use of a
rope.</li>
<li>Falls are typically protected against by the use of large portable
mats (bouldering mats).</li>
<li>Concentrates on technically difficult short climbs.</li>
<li>Usually (though not exclusively) performed on boulders, as opposed to cliff faces (hence the name).</li>

<h2>Aid Climbing</h2>

<ul>
<li>Uses ropes.</li>
<li>The rock itself is climbed utilising special ladder-like equipment
called ""aiders"".</li>
<li>Items of equipment are placed onto or into the rock face and an aider is attached. The climber then climbs the aider.</li>
<li>Part of the climbing may be done using hands and feet, but at least some portions use aid.</li>
<li>At least in Europe it is also called <em>technical climbing</em>.</li>
<li>One of the earliest forms of rock climbing coming out of the alpinist movement of the 1930s.</li>
<li>With enough effort practically <em>everything</em> can be climbed. Therefore countermovement of free climbing evolved in the 1970s.</li>
<li><em>""Siege tactics""</em> can be used. This can involve people taking months to climb difficult climbs, coming up and down at will (see the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_rock_climbing#1950s"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1958 climb by Warren Harding and team to climb the 3,000 foot ""Nose"" of El Capitan in Yosemite</a>)</li>

"Do polarized sunglasses protect against snow blindness?","10740","","<p>Will regular polarized sunglasses protect me against <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photokeratitis"">snow blindness</a>? And if not what type of glasses/goggles will protect me?</p>
","<p>Regular polarized sunglasses are usually meant for drivers of cars, as these glasses, in addition to darkening the sky, also suppress glare/reflections. </p>

<p>If you travel in snow, light will come from all different angles and directions and will therefore be polarized in all kinds of directions, so a mere polarizer will not filter a sufficient amount of light. I learned this the hard way...</p>

<p>So in addition to a polarizer, any goggles you use in the outdoors should have something that darkens independent of orientation. How much depends on where you want to go. Just in the mountains where there is some snow, or onto glaciers and ice fields where you'll see nothing but snow for days. I don't know the numbers off the top of my head, but I know that the goggles I use for trekking are so dark that I'm not allowed to wear them while driving (some 99% reduction, I believe). This is something people in an outdoors store should be able to explain to you.</p>

<p>Another very important thing to watch out for is stray light. What I also learned the hard way is that clip-on sunshades for your regular glasses let too much light in from the sides. You want to make sure that once you wear your goggles, any light that reaches your eyes must travel through the glasses. Again, on a glacier or in snow, light comes from all directions. Serious expedition-style goggles therefore look a bit like old pilot's goggles, with leather at the sides preventing any stray light from sneaking in. </p>

"What's the difference between water-resistant and waterproof?","10730","","<p>I've gone camping for quite a bit, but when it comes to choosing between water resistant and waterproof gear, I always take the latter.</p>

<p>I'm actually curious if there's a difference between these two terms.  For me, water-resistant always sounded like some cheap marketing gimmick to make the product seem waterproof.  Is there any actual ""real"" difference?</p>
","<p>From my experience, <strong>water resistant</strong> means that <strong>the item will survive a splash of water</strong> but not any form of prolonged exposure.</p>

<p><strong>Water proof</strong> suggest that it is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Impervious to or unaffected by water.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For <em>waterproof</em> items, there is often an IP number provided which helps you understand the level of waterproofness the item offers.</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Code"">IP codes</a> are widely used in the industry.</p>

<p>For example, a <a href=""http://www.petzl.com/us/pro/headlamps/ultra-compact/elite"">E+LITE</a> from Petzl is rated as IP67 per the manufacturer. IP67 means you can expect the light to work if it is submerged in water less than a meter for no more than 30 minutes.</p>

<p>For outwear such as jackets, the bigger issue is that if your jacket is fully waterproof, you will end up wet from your own sweat. The balance between breathability, waterproofness and longevity of the material are all equally important factors in this case. </p>

"Why aren't there any electric stoves that can be used for cooking where you can't build a fire?","10629","","<p>There are quite a few countries where you aren't allowed to make open fires in the great outdoors (I'm sure for at least Austria and Germany). I wondered why nobody has yet thought about electric stoves? </p>

<p>As you can't use common gas stoves (cause open fire/flame), you could use battery powered stoves without a flame. </p>
","<h2>Comparing hydrocarbons with batteries</h2>

<p>As Olin Lathrop wrote, the big problem is energy density: hydrocarbon fuels simply offer a huge amount of energy per unit mass, compared to any current battery technology. To put some numbers on this, we can look at <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia's page on energy density</a>. Let's compare ethanol (probably the least energy-dense of the commonly used camping stove fuels) with non-rechargeable lithium batteries (the most energy-dense of current battery technologies).</p>

<p>Ethanol fuel provides 26.4 MJ/kg; lithium batteries provide 1.8 MJ/kg -- less than one-fourteenth as much per unit mass. So if you had <strong>100 g of ethanol (about 127 ml)</strong> for cooking purposes and wanted to substitute it with electrical power, you'd need about <strong>1.4 kg of disposable lithium batteries</strong>. If you want rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, you'll need about 2.8 kg of them (the energy density is about half that of disposables). As gerrit pointed out in the comments, you also need to think about <em>power density:</em> even if your battery contains enough energy to cook, it might not be able to output that energy fast enough for practical cooking.</p>

<p>Battery technology is improving all the time, but there are no technologies currently in development which would give anything like the order-of-magnitude improvement needed to make them competitive with hydrocarbons for energy density.</p>

<h2>So it's not ideal, but is it feasible?</h2>

<p>It's clear that batteries are far less energy-dense than hydrocarbon fuels, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they're a lost cause -- perhaps the extra weight would be small enough to be manageable, especially if you're hiking in a German forest where the only alternatives to flameless heating are breaking the law and eating cold food.</p>

<p>I'll start by picking a battery pack, then look at how much cooking we could get out of it. This <a href=""http://amzn.com/B009880J6A"" rel=""noreferrer"">E-bike battery pack</a> is currently retailing on Amazon for around 277 USD. Its vital statistics are: 24 V, 11 Ah, 262 Watt-hours or 943 kJ of energy capacity. It weighs about 2.3 kg and can output 15 Amps of continuous power, which gives a maximum of 360 Watts. (I specifically looked for an e-bike battery pack, since they tend to be designed for relatively high power output.) For cooking, let's keep it simple and decide that we just want to boil water, which we can then use for beverages, instant soups, noodles, dehydrated meals, and so on. So we can attach the battery pack to a 24-volt electric immersion heater <a href=""http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Hot-Water-24v-volt-heater-kettle-element-tea-coffee-NEW-/130462659545?hash=item1e602e33d9"" rel=""noreferrer"">like this one</a>. It's rated at 200 Watts, well within the capacity of the battery. I don't see a weight specified on this one, but other similar heating elements I've seen online weigh under 100 g, so our whole electric heating set-up is under 2.4 kg.</p>

<p>How many hot meals can we make with this set-up? Water has a specific heat capacity of about 4.18 J⋅g<sup>−1</sup>⋅K<sup>−1</sup>. Let's say that for each meal we want to heat 500 ml of water from 15°C to 100°C. That's going to require 4.18 × 500 × 85 = 177650 J of energy. Let's round up and call it 200 kJ since the water might be colder and we'll be losing some heat to the pot. As a double-check on this calculation, I just timed my 1 kW kettle bringing 500 ml of 11°C tap water to a rolling boil; it took 210 seconds, so (assuming the power rating is correct) used 210 kJ of energy. Remembering that the battery pack holds 943 kJ and using this higher figure for the water boil, we get 943 / 210 =~ <strong>4.5 half-litre boils from a 2.4 kg electric heating system.</strong></p>

<p>Whether this is practical or not depends on the circumstances and personal judgement. On a two-day hike, this set-up would give you at minimum a hot drink every morning, and a hot drink and hot meal every evening. If you can manage on 560 ml of boiling water per day, you could even stretch as far as four days. The 2.4 kg would probably be unthinkable for a hard-core ultralighter, but it's clearly not an impossible weight to carry. For longer hikes, of course, it swiftly becomes impractical. At this point you probably have to start thinking about solar panels for recharging in the wilderness :-).</p>

<h2>Things are getting better (but very slowly)</h2>

<p>Lithium-ion technology has been on the market since 1991, with variable but fairly continuous improvements from one year to the next. Energy density tends to increase, on average, by a few percent per year. This makes for significant improvements in the long term: as the graph below from Masias et al. (2013) shows, energy density of the common 18650 battery cell improved by a factor of more than 2.5 between 1991 and 2013:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/T5fCb.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/T5fCb.jpg"" alt=""Figure: Energy density trends""></a></p>

<p>Similar trends can be seen in the data of Jeong et al. (2011) and Pistoia (2014).</p>

<p>We can probably expect these marginal improvements to continue at least for a few years more (Tesla seem <a href=""http://ecomento.com/2015/12/16/elon-musk-speaks-about-batteries-and-emissions-at-agu/"" rel=""noreferrer"">fairly confident</a> about it, for instance). So our 2.4 kg weekend water-boiler will probably come down below 2 kg in the foreseeable future, but beyond that it's hard to say. Even if lithium-ion energy density could continue to improve indefinitely at 10% per year, it would take over two decades to catch up with ethanol. Would-be electric hikers might do better to pin their hopes on the development of some entirely new battery design. There are plenty of research groups working on potentially revolutionary new battery technologies, but <strong>potentially</strong> is the key word here: very few bright ideas survive the long journey from notebook to laboratory to factory.</p>

"Is it warmer to sleep with an empty bladder?","10601","","<p>One of the recommendations for sleeping warm is to empty your bladder before bed,</p>

<p>What would be the <strong>scientific</strong> reason for why this is so or possibly why it is not?</p>
","<p>Humans have a few intuitions about how temperature, heat, and liquids work. These intuitions lead us astray for the specific case of a bladder full of urine.</p>

<h3>""Keeping Warm"" / ""Cooling down""</h3>

<p>The first intuition is that <em>things cool down on their own</em>: If you leave a pie from the oven on your counter, it eventually cools down to room temperature.</p>

<p>We believe things cool down (and thus must be <em>""kept warm""</em>) because ambient temperature is nearly always colder than any object which we consider to be warm. In reality, things only cool down when <em>their temperature is higher than the temperature of their surroundings</em>.</p>

<p>This is thermal equilibrium: <strong>in the absence of other processes, an object and its surroundings will eventually match temperature</strong>.</p>

<p>Does this principle of <em>things cool down on their own</em> apply here? No. Urine in your bladder is already at thermal equilibrium with the rest of your body.</p>

<h3>""Cool Liquids""</h3>

<p>We also intuit that liquids are colder than normal matter, because wetting your hands results in a very high surface area-to-mass ratio, causing rapid evaporation. Evaporation is a cooling process, of course.</p>

<p>We also think liquids are colder because they tend to have good thermal conductivity. We perceive the temperature of an object based on the rate of heat exchange with it; that rate is determined by the difference in temperature and its conductivity. Thermally conductive things feel warmer or colder than their nonconductive counterparts because they ""move"" heat more quickly. This is why metal objects at room temperature feel colder than e.g. cotton at the same temperature -- they are the same temperature, but the higher-conductivity object exchanges heat more quickly. It's also why you can put your hand into a 450 F oven without getting burned, but can't safely grab a metal pan at the same temperature.</p>

<p>Do these properties of <em>cool liquids</em> apply here? No. Urine in your bladder cannot undergo evaporation (it's a closed system), and its high thermal conductivity is irrelevant because it's already at the same temperature as the rest of your body.</p>

<h3>Physics</h3>

<p>There are only a few factors we need to consider to determine the nighttime temperature of a camper in a sleeping bag:</p>

<ul>
<li>Starting heat energy: How much thermal energy are we starting off with? Going to bed cold is going to be worse than going to bed warm. Starting with a hot water bottle in your sleeping bag is better than starting with a bagful of ice in your sleeping bag.</li>
<li>Insulation: What is the thermal conductivity between the sleeping bag and the surrounding environment? Well-insulated bags are better than poorly-insulated bags</li>
<li>Exterior temperature: How cold is the surrounding environment? All things equal, colder exterior temperatures will cause a higher rate of heat loss.</li>
<li>Endothermic / exothermic processes: How much heat is the camper generating (e.g. from metabolism)? Humans convert chemical energy (food calories) into heat; if we burn more calories in this process, we'll stay warmer.</li>
</ul>

<p>This leaves us with two possible physically-possible mechanisms of action for the ""full bladder makes you colder"" hypothesis:</p>

<ul>
<li>Endothermic reaction: It's <em>in theory</em> possible that urine undergoes some endothermic chemical reaction, like a one-time-use ice pack. There's no evidence for this happening; urine does not meaningfully change chemical composition over time when sitting in the bladder.</li>
<li>Exothermic inhibition: It's <em>in theory</em> possible that the human body inhibits its own metabolism when its bladder is full. It definitely seems like we'd notice if this were actually the case. Either way, the mechanism of action here is not that we are ""keeping our urine warm"".</li>
</ul>

<h3>Running the numbers: A Sanity Check</h3>

<p>The original claim is that you don't have to ""keep warm"" the contents of your bladder. We've shown that this isn't really a thing, but what if it were? A healthy full adult bladder is about 300 mL of liquid, which would weigh about 300 grams (or half a pound). For a hiker weighing 80 kg / 175 lbs, that's about 0.3% of your total body mass. Is a 0.3% change in body mass really going to significantly change your overnight heating situation? That's implausible at best. Note that the change in surface area (assuming you expand with a full bladder, rather than simply compress other parts of your body) is going to be <em>smaller</em> than 0.3% because surface is a quadratic measure but volume is cubic.</p>

<p>If this effect were actually noticeable, it should be <em>twice</em> as strong for taking a normal #2 (weight 1-3 lbs) right before bed, because you should have to ""keep warm"" your poop just as much as your urine (presumably). No one seems to comment on this. Humans are pretty good at sensing their bladder fullness but not great at sensing bowel fullness when it's within normal parameters, which suggests there's a strong psychological component going on here.</p>

<p>What about a hot water bottle in the sleeping bag with you, a common suggestion? Does this matter?</p>

<p>If we heat up a 1 L bottle of water (1,000 grams) to 100 C (boiling) and it eventually cools to 24 C (74 F, a rough guess at the temperature in a warm sleeping bag), we've added 76 Calories* of heat to our system. Basal sleeping metabolism is about 80 Calories per hour; nearly all of these Calories turn into heat (only the small portion stored as chemical energy, e.g. ATP, don't). So if the water bottle cools down to ambient temperature within an hour (a decent guess), it's almost as good as having another human zipped up in the sleeping bag with you for the first hour, which is definitely something. There's a throughput trade-off here; if you insulate the water bottle a bunch to make it cool down over twice the period of time, you get half the per-time energy output.</p>

"How to straighten a bent tent pole","10581","","<p>During a storm one of my tent poles that used to be straight, became bent. Is there a way to straighten the pole again?
Or is it a bad idea to try straightening the pole because is would likely snap anyhow and is replacing the pole the way to go? (<a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/4412/how-to-find-new-poles-for-old-tent"">There is already a question about finding replacement poles</a>)</p>

<p>As a clarification, a picture of the bent pole. It shouldn't bend at all.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PK55E.jpg"" alt=""Picture of the bent pole""></p>
","<p>Aluminum has a crystal structure and can be hardened using a process called ""work hardening."" Long story short, <em>you've hardened your pole by causing dislocation movements in the crystal structure of the aluminum.</em> If you compare your bent pole to your other poles, you'll notice that it doesn't flex as much as it used to, that is because it is now a harder alloy than the rest. Any attempt to bend it back now that you've somewhat work-hardened it will cause fractures in the alloy. The only way to soften the aluminum is to anneal it, which involves heating the aluminum almost to it's melting point and then letting it cool slowly, but if you try to do that then your pole will be so soft that it won't flex, it'll just bend like welding wire. You would have to know how to re-harden the aluminum after you annealed it and bent it back, not a simple process, and not that cheap to get a metal worker to do it for you. </p>

<p>You're best option is to either replace your pole, or deal with it being bent, unless you have a friend who is a millwright and knows how to anneal and harden alloys. Bent poles aren't that bad, I've been using bent poles in my MSR Hubba Hubba for years. Your pole is still strong, it's just not as straight and flexible as it used to be, annoying, but still functional. </p>

<hr>

<p>You won't be able to get your pole back to what it was, but if you wanted to attempt to get your pole straight and see how much longer it lasts, my recommendation would be to use a pipe or <strong>tube straightener</strong>.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q2RcR.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Just don't expect results, and expect a struggle, like I said, that hardened bend won't bend back easy, if you take the pole to a hardware store then you might find some plumber guy that'll be convinced he could get it straight for you. But don't be surprised after he breaks it or puts stretch fractures in it from trying. You can be surprised instead if he actually gets it straight and it doesn't bend right back the first time you try using it again.</p>

"Climbing with a much lighter partner?","10524","","<p>Both my fiancee and myself bought some climbing gear recently and we're planning our first trip to an indoor rock gym this weekend. We decided to practice our knots and belay technique before we went so we rigged some rope to a chin-up bar to practice letting one person hang while the other person held the ""brake"" position to get used to how it would feel. </p>

<p>The problem is, while I could hold my fiancee just fine, she weighs about 70 lbs less than me and had a really hard time holding my weight, in fact she could barely hold it at all. I'm worried that she won't be able to hold me if I were to fall while climbing. Surely, we can't be the first climbing pair to have different weights...is there a way to fix this? Is there any mechanical advantage of having the ""lever"" of the top rope much higher than the practice chin-up bar is? </p>

<p>EDIT: From some research, it seems like there <em>may</em> be a difference when top-roping vs. lead climbing? For reference, we will only be doing top-roping for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p><strong>FOLLOW-UP: We just got back from climbing for the first time today at an indoor gym and we didn't have any trouble at all. My partner anchored herself to the ground as mentioned in the answers and the weight wasn't even an issue.</strong> </p>

<p>Thanks for any insights!</p>
","<p>In a gym, the toprope will be wrapped over a cylindrical bar. Some gyms have it just over the top of the bar (180 degrees of contact), while others give it an additional full wrap around (540 degrees of contact). In the former setup, a belayer can hold the static weight of a climber who weighs roughly twice as much as she does; the friction between the rope and the pulley keeps it from slipping. In the latter setup, the factor is much larger, maybe 10 or more.</p>

<p>In your chin-up bar test setup, I assume you had 180 degrees of contact. When you say she could ""barely hold"" your weight, are you describing a situation where she was simply sitting in her harness with her weight hung from her end of the rope? She shouldn't be trying to hold the weight with her hands. Only a relatively small force from her braking hand (below the belay device) should be needed in order to keep the rope from slipping through the device.</p>

<p>If it's in doubt whether your partner's body weight is enough to suspend you, she should anchor herself to a weight or to a carabiner connected to the floor. Ask at the desk and they can show you what they have for you to use and how to use it.</p>

<p>In case she isn't anchored and does get picked up off of the floor, it's extremely important for her not to panic and release the rope through the belay device. Practice having her catch a fall when she's expecting it. (You typically want to practice this about 15 feet off the ground. It should be high enough so that rope stretch can't bring you to the floor, but not so high that a fumble gets you killed.) Even in a real fall where you're 50 feet above the floor, if she stays calm and keeps tension on the brake strand, the worst that will happen is that you'll accelerate down to the floor relatively gently, you'll survive, and she'll be left suspended until someone comes along to help.</p>

<p>For toproping, none of this is as much as of an issue as you might imagine. It becomes more of an issue for lead climbing. Even for lead climbing, I've seen very small belayers competently catch big lead falls by big guys.</p>

"Tips for travelling through Europe with just a tent","10457","","<p>Myself and my girlfriend are hoping to start off in the Netherlands and hitchhike our way down to the south of Spain through various French towns / cities.</p>

<p>We are planning on just bringing sleeping bags and a tent. I have a couple of questions for somebody who might have knowledge in this area.</p>

<p><strong>Does anybody have any tips on where / how to find a suitable location to set up a discrete camp for the night?</strong> This one has been bugging me since I know virtually all the land is owned by somebody. </p>

<p><strong>Is there any general hitchhiking etiquette found in Europe?</strong> I have been doing a lot of reading on hitchwiki but would like to hear from somebody with first hand experience (also safety / difficulties).</p>
","<p>I can not give a lot of information about hitchhiking but have spend a lot of time wildcamping in Europe. Sure most land is privatly owned, and most countries have regulations against it, but in most cases you will be fine and undisturbed if you take some things into account:</p>

<ul>
<li>Try to hide your tent, only set it up right before you want to go sleep.</li>
<li>Find a location you don't expect people to show up, little pass by traffic, remote as possible. The closer to a city/village the harder this gets.</li>
<li>Don't use more light (when dark) than required, don't make a fire.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've done this 200+ nights on roadtrips, travelling with a car makes you more mobile to reach rural places, but limits you to roads. When hitchhiking you can be asked to be dropped off and get away from the road on foot. Try to have a good map so you know in what direction to find rural terrain. Start looking for a place to spend the night a few hours before sunset, so you know you have enough time and do not need to find something in the dark. Mountain terrain is often a bit harder because there isn't a lot of horizontal ground, unless you want to visit the Pyrenees I would suggest you try to hitchhike across them in a single day.</p>

<p>Parking lots of nature parks or walking trails are usually an easy target, but may also attract other people, pitch up your tent where it is safe (you don't want to have a camper park on top of you in the middle of the night). </p>

<p>Try to not sleep near a big road, there will be traffic the entire night and you won't get a lot of sleep.
 In the south there are many semi-dry rivers which are attractive and fun to sleep at. I've done so a few times but in retrospect one should really take into account that there may be flash floods, and that is definitely not something you want to happen.</p>

<p>If you want to spend a lot of time in cities, still finding a suitable camping spot may be hard, couch-surfing may be a good alternative for the nights you want to spend in a city.</p>

"Does touching the tent outer wall from the inside make it leak?","10409","","<p><a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/9223/what-are-some-techniques-to-avoid-touching-a-wet-tent-wall"">This question</a> about how not to make anything touch the outer wall of the tent implies that doing so lets the outer tent leak water through. I never head this problem with my <a href=""http://www.vango.co.uk/gb/duke-of-edinburgh-recommended/177-mirage-300.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">vango mirage tent</a> during a recent trip in heavy rain and wind even though my bag touched the outer tent and the wind pushed the outer tent onto the lower parts of the inner tent on the sides. Still from scouting I know that with <a href=""https://www.spatz.ch/default/zelte/zeltart/hauszelt/gruppen-spatz-180.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this Spatz tent</a> the outer tent will leak when touched from the inside.</p>

<p>What materials/surface treatments of tent outer walls do/don't leak water when touched from the inside?</p>

<p>As a bonus but not really outdoor related: What is the reason for one material to (not) leak?</p>

<p>EDIT: The distinction that it is not leaking before touching and leaking after touching is important. It is obvious that when it leaked before and you touch the outer, that the inner gets wet.</p>
","<p>Snow Crash's and WedaPashi's answers explain well, how water leaks through the fabric by capillary action and how touching the inside increases water flow through the fabric. I will try to answer the first part about why this effect is apparent in some fabrics and not so much in others. I base this on two excellent but sadly deleted answers by Dynadin and Aravona. While naturally by rewriting my own interpretation will impact the result, it is still their work who made it possible.</p>

<p>The question of whether it leaks on contact is mostly related around the difference between modern and older tents. This has to do with the hydrostatic head (HH) of the material. So the higher this rating on a material, the more water it can withstand before becoming permeable. Older tents usually have lower hydrostatic head and in addition, they were often untreated materials. Newer tents have materials whose outer surface is treated. This coating prevents water from getting through by capillary action when touched from inside. Without this coating, the only thing resisting the water going through is a higher HH.</p>

<p>As an example a recent tent (Dynadin's): It has three sections: Outer, inner and ground sheet, which are all made from polyester. The inner has no HH, any water will pass straight through. So if you touch it it, you will get wet quickly. The outer has a 5000 HH. Even when you touch it on the inside while it is completely wet on the outside no water gets through. The ground sheet has a 8000 HH. So even with constant pressure on it there will not pass any water through.</p>

<p>Modern tents made of polyester or nylon are most often treated and have a high HH, so you usually do not need to worry about touching the inside - they still wont leak. Cotton and canvas tents (older) are usually untreated and have a lower HH, so they will leak via capillary action when touched from the inside.</p>

"How can I avoid or lessen sweating in a rain jacket?","10305","","<p>I have a nylon rain jacket that I wear to walk my dogs when it rains. It seems that no matter what clothes I wear underneath, I always end up very sweaty. I've tried long sleeves, short sleeves, quick-dry and cotton shirts, but it just happens after about 10 minutes. Of course, Texas weather is generally hot anyway, but still..</p>

<p>Does anyone have tips for avoiding or lessening sweating while wearing a rain jacket?</p>
","<p>Staying dry in a rain jacket requires you to sweat less moisture than the cloths you are wearing can breath out.  </p>

<p>The most effective way to let moisture out is ventilation, unfortunately, that means holes big enough to let water in -e.g. cotton. With a rain coat, apart from wearing it open, Pit zips (zips under the arms) are a very effective way to get a lot of ventilation without letting too much water in (even some very good breathable jackets have them.). The extreme form of a well ventilated rain coat is an Umbrella :) . </p>

<p>The alternate is what are known collectively as breathable fabrics that let water vapour though the fabric, but not water. Goretex is probably the most well known as it was the first to be widely commercialised (It came out of the NASA space program), but there are many others now.  </p>

<p>Choosing a fabric is really a trade off between breathability, water proofness, robustness, and cost. Choose three, accept the fourth. Goretex has different fabrics suited for different tasks, with different pricing.</p>

<p>Humidity significantly affect how breathable a particular jacket is on a given day. If humidity is high and its warm, forget about staying dry, even the very best jacket will not breath enough and you might as well wear nylon (or nothing).  If its cold and dry, even a cheap breathable jacket will breath well enough to keep you dry.  If the outer layer has water build up on it, the jacket won't breath - new jackets have coating (DWR) that makes the water bead up and run off. </p>

<p>In the end, some days you are just going to get wet, and the only thing you can do to stay dry is stay home. The more you spend, the fewer of these days you get. Some days, its just as easy to leave the raincoat at home and wear cloths that keep you warm even if you are wet. </p>

<p>Would there be any advantages to hiking during the night and sleeping during the day?</p>
","<p>There are several reasons, though not all of them would apply for one's usual holiday trip.</p>

<p><strong>Remaining unseen</strong></p>

<p>Obviously, during night its dark and this gives you a fair bit of cover if you want to remain unseen. This reason for traveling at night is common for many hunters in the animal kingdom (and sometimes also their prey), has been used by humans in insecure or hostile territory for centuries and remains a standard technique for some military operations even today. </p>

<p><strong>Evading the elements</strong></p>

<p>Hiking throughout the night and resting in the day can be especially useful in hot, arid conditions. For example in deserts, extreme heat during the day and severe cold in the night often come together. Hiking during the night here serves the double purpose of keeping you active and warm when it is cold while allowing you to save water resources during the day.</p>

<p><strong>Boosting morale</strong></p>

<p>When conditions get worse (cold, moisture), getting up during the night and starting to hike will not only make you feel warm again, it will also boost your morale. Being active, and actively coping with a bad situation rather than staying miserable in the tent for the rest of the night will make you feel better.</p>

<p><strong>You want to avoid tourists</strong></p>

<p>No, seriously, this is a real case in point. Most people travel during the day and one of the reasons we (or at least, I) get outdoors is to enjoy some quietness in the wild. Depending where you are, hiking at night is your best bet to fulfill this dream.</p>

<p><strong>Navigation</strong> (only very theoretical)</p>

<p>Consider a situation where it is all cloudy during the day (so you do not see the sun), you lack a compass and currently have no sense of direction: if you are capable of navigating with the stars, you might consider waiting until dark and hope that the sky will clear up until then. </p>

"How effective are pen launcher bear bangers compared to bearspray?","10231","","<p>So <a href=""http://www.mec.ca/product/4007-146/tru-flare-pen-launcher-kit/?q=bear%2Bbangers"" rel=""noreferrer"">pen launcher bear bangers</a> have apparently been around for quite a while, the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNh-KyndVOk"" rel=""noreferrer"">training video</a> for Truflare looks like something from out of the 90's, but they don't appear to be very popular, and I don't hear many people recommending them as an alternative to bear spray, despite the fact that they're much cheaper than bearspray.</p>

<p><sup>The smaller flare cartridges below are classic red signal flares, the larger cartridges are the bear bangers, which have a delayed explosive charge that makes a <em>really</em> loud bang.</sup></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UxiHd.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I'm familiar with bear bangers that you fire from a shotgun, but those are different, they're actually a large rubber wad that you shoot the bear with, so the bang is the impact the shot makes when it hits the bear. These pen launcher bear bangers get shot in the air, so the bang is the noise from the explosion. </p>

<p>Aside from being a lot smaller and lighter (and cheaper), these seem to me like they could potentially be a lot more effective than bear spray, especially considering you could choose to aim the banger <em>at</em> the bear in desperate situations, and it would be effective from a greater range, and could be deployed against more than one bear at a time. </p>

<p>How effective are bear bangers compared to bear spray? </p>
","<p>Bear bangers and bear spray are designed for slightly different situations.</p>

<p>Bear bangers are intended to use when a bear is still a ways off, but is showing no signs of leaving, or is wandering towards you. The idea is to scare the bear off before he gets close enough that you need to be seriously worried. They generally shoot a few hundred feet.  Looking through online forums, there's some suggestions that they are illegal in at least some National Parks, but I didn't find any specifics. But if you are planning on taking them with you, I'd recommend contacting whoever is in charge of the land you are hiking on, and asking if they are legal. Since they work with an explosive charge, there's also a fire risk (relatively low, but if it's a dry environment, the fire risk will still be high). They are louder than things like bells and shouting, but the principle is the same.</p>

<p>Bear spray is for close encounters. By the time the bear is close enough for the spray to be effective, it's obvious that the bear is behaving aggressively.  According to <a href=""http://www.centerforwildlifeinformation.org/BeBearAware/BearSpray/bearspray.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.centerforwildlifeinformation.org/BeBearAware/BearSpray/bearspray.html</a>, bear spray should be used when the bear is 25 feet away or more, and should be sprayed for at least 6 seconds (enough to deter even a determined bear). Most of the sprays I read about claimed to shoot 30-35 feet. I'd guess that distance is in ideal conditions- warm, no wind. Bear spray is intended as a last resort, once its clear that noise is not making the bear back off. </p>

<p>In short, bear bangers are meant to work as a deterrent, much like bells or shouting. Bear spray is meant as a defense, for use once you are already in trouble, and the bear is clearly behaving aggressively and is close.</p>

<p>Edit: A note on bells, since their effectiveness is being questioned in the comments. A quick internet search shows that their effectiveness is low, and probably varies geographically and with species: Alaskan bears were observed ignoring it, Sierra bears were slightly less likely to attack a group with bells. Maybe because the Sierra bears are more likely to run into hikers wearing them, and hear them as a warning sign, while in Alaska, there's a lot fewer hikers, so it's just an unfamiliar, unimportant noise. But since the bells are cheap, and no one's reported evidence that they increase bear attacks, I'd still be willing to use one. If anyone finds evidence that they really work do work as a dinner bell though, I'll be very quick to change my mind.</p>

"How can I tell if a opossum is truly dead?","10213","","<p>I saw a opossum (the North American kind) on a golf course the other day. It looked pretty dead - there was foam coming out of its mouth and flies buzzing all around it. However, I know opossums can convincingly play dead by involuntarily entering a catatonic-like state. Are there any tell-tale signs indicating a opossum is really dead? Would the flies be buzzing around it if it was actually alive?</p>
","<h2>How to tell if an opossum is truly dead?</h2>

<p>The only safe thing you can do is wait. Commonly after an hour, the ears of the Opossum start to move slightly. This is your indicator to know that it's an actor :) </p>

<p>After four hours of stiff ears, you can be pretty sure that you are looking down on a dead animal. Call the competent authority (local veterinarian, wildlife rehabilitator, animal control etc.) for assistance. </p>

<p>From <a href=""http://www.wildliferescuerehab.com/opossums.html"">Wildlife Rescue Rehab</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Give a ""dead"" opossum the benefit of the doubt before disposing of the
  body. It may be ""playing possum"" as an involuntary response to a
  threat, in which the opossum becomes comatose in the face of danger
  and appears dead. This may last from 40 minutes to 4 hours. During
  this time, the opossum lies on its side, becomes stiff, the eyes glaze
  over, the opossum drools, the tongue lolls out the side of the mouth,
  and green anal fluid may be seen. This fascinating defense mechanism
  helps the opossum survive an attack from a predator because many
  predators give up the attack if they believe the opossum is already
  dead. Leave the area and give the opossum a chance to recover and move
  on. The opossum will <strong>not respond to prodding or poking</strong>. When the
  opossum is about to recover, the ears move very slightly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know that this may not be the answer you were looking for, but it's the only way to be absolutely sure, without touching the animal. Interacting with wildlife (poking with a stick, touching it with the bare hand etc.), is no way to go. </p>

<p>Further reading: <a href=""http://opossumsocietyus.org/how-to-help/orphaned-injured/"">Opossum Society US</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opossum#Behavior"">Wikipedia Behavior</a></p>

<h2>Are there any tell-tale signs indicating an opossum is really dead?</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, the only real sign is that it hasn't made a single movement (the ears ;)) within at least four hours. So, there aren't any real tell-tale signs. </p>

<p>Of course, if the head is apart ... Well, I think you got the concept. </p>

<h2>Would the flies be buzzing around it if it was actually alive?</h2>

<p>The opossum releases a stinking fluid when in fear. So, yes, laying there releasing stinky fluid without any movement will result into buzzing. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fear can cause release of a greenish-colored anal fluid. Opossums
  cannot “spray”, and the only way this unpleasant-smelling body fluid
  can come in contact with you is if your clothes brush the anal area.
  It washes off easily.</p>

"What is the difference between external and internal-frame packs?","10196","","<p>I am starting backpacking and there are both internal and external-frame packs. What is the difference, and is one recommended over the other?</p>
","<p>I've used both kinds of packs.</p>

<p><strong>External frame</strong> packs are generally cheaper, can carry more gear, and allow much better ventilation to your back.  In addition to the main compartment and side pockets, most external frame packs also have an area above and below the main compartment where gear can be lashed.</p>

<p><strong>Internal frame</strong> packs tend to have larger interior volume, allow more freedom of movement, and (especially in areas prone to thunderstorms) don't have large metallic poles that go above your head.  I've seen a few modern internal frame packs that have air channels for ventilation, I've never tried one, but it looks like it may help to keep things cooler.</p>

","<p>If you want to reduce your visual impact on the other people in the area, choose a tent with colors that match the landscape you're going to camp in.  Green in forest or other vegetated areas, brown for the desert, white for winter camping.</p>

<p>However, if you are in trouble and want to be found, it helps to have a very bright tent that stands out.  A tent you can see from kilometers away.  A tent that is going to annoy that other backpacker who was just having the illusion to be alone in the world, and now he or she isn't.  Such a tent might save your life if rescue agencies are looking for you.</p>

<p>So, to reduce visual impact: choose camouflage. To quicken rescue in emergency: choose anything BUT camouflage.</p>

"What is the safest way to purify water?","10119","","<p>There are a number of ways to purify water, off the top of my head we have filters, iodine, and boiling.  Clearly each has some advantage/disadvantage (iodine tastes terrible, boiling takes time).  Which of these is the safest? Is there another method that's safer?</p>
","<p>When you're asking for the safest way to purify water, you're asking for the method that removes the most harmful stuff from the water, like bacteria, viruses and larger impurities like mud or sand.</p>

<p>No one method is really perfect at removing everything, so I usually use a two-stage approach:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Filter</strong>: If the water source is cloudy, your first step should be to remove the larger impurities. You can buy expensive pump filters for this, or you can just pour the water through a sock, bandanna, or any other tightly-woven fabric to remove the larger stuff.</p>

<p>Note that you can probably skip this step if the water you're collecting is clear and fast-moving. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Boil</strong>: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterilization_%28microbiology%29#Heat_sterilization_of_foods"">Heat sterilization</a> is really the only sure-fire way to kill bacteria, viruses and other undesirable microbial life in your water. It's a commonly used technique to clean medical instruments since it's so effective. </p>

<p>It does require a heat source, and it'll take some time to get a full rolling boil. But if you're at all worried about the quality of your water, it's your safest bet.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> As commenters noted, if you're in an area with potential chemical pollutants or metals in the water, you should filter even if the water appears clear. But if you're really in a situation where mother nature's water has been tainted by man-made waste, you should probably pack in all of your own water anyways.</p>

"Sandpapering Finger Tips","10109","","<p><strong>Is sandpapering your finger tips an effective way to improve anything about your rock climbing?</strong></p>

<p>On occasion, I will see climbers in YouTube videos or people at the local crag using sand paper on their finger tips. Why do people do this? What benefit is there? Is this, perhaps, more superstition than practical?</p>
","<p>In my opinion there are a couple valid reasons to use sand paper.</p>

<ol>
<li>File down current calluses, therefore avoiding large calluses from getting snagged/pinching itself resulting in a flapper(ripped piece of skin only attached at a small point).<br></li>
<li>Toughen up the skin, resulting in less sensitive and more durable skin.</li>
</ol>

<p>When you are a beginner it will take time to develop the hard skin on your hands and finger tips, you will get flappers regardless of whether or not you are using sandpaper, the sand paper will just help get that skin tougher faster.</p>

<p>Once you have hard skin I find sandpaper to be a great tool.  Why?  If you can't make it outside or head to the gym you can roll up some sandpaper into a ball and just play with it.  This will keep the skin on your hands in tip top shape for when you get back climbing!</p>

<p>I also keep some on hand in case I get any sort of issue with my fingernails while climbing, I can then use the sand paper to repair the issue.</p>

<p>When removing calluses go nuts until it's level or just slightly raised above the normal skin.</p>

<p><strong>When playing with the ball of sandpaper or sanding your HANDS(ie.Not Removing Callouses) you are not going crazy on high speed with a belt sander!  You are just scuffing up your skin lightly by hand with approximately 60&lt;->220 Grit Paper! I find 150 grit works great!</strong></p>

<p>Useful Tip:  If you're planning on getting onto a campus board shave those nails down with a file or sandpaper! You do not want long nails OR clipped too short!</p>

<p>With regards to the OP's question on practical Benefit I would like to point out the following two photograph's of my hand.  The first before using sandpaper, very difficult to climb, and the second 4 weeks after the first but using sandpaper, much easier to climb.  The second is much dryer and tougher!</p>

"What purpose does a mesh liner serve in outdoors clothing?","9974","","<p>Some outdoors clothing have an inner mesh lining of polyester (or similar) fabric. What purpose does such a lining serve? Does it insulate or is it for transporting humidity from the body?</p>
","<p>The liner acts as a climate control mechanism for your body through a reduction of moisture and an increase in circulation. The synthetic fiber content acts as a wick to pull the moisture away from your skin, while the mesh composition acts as a suspension system that increases airflow by maintaining separation between your skin/undershirt and the remainder of the garment. Additionally, the increased surface area of the mesh allows for greater air to moisture contact. The wicking and increased airflow therefore increases the rate of evapotranspiration, which allows your body to maintain a more consistent comfort level without the need to add or remove layers.</p>

"Is campfire smoke safe for inhalation and cooking?","9969","","<p>Is it safe to burn any kind of wood as campfire if you are going to be cooking on it directly? Like broiling a steak on a grill over the fire where the smoke and the flames will touch the meat. Can some wood produce fumes that are not safe?</p>

<p>What about inhalation? Does campfire smoke cause damage to lungs? I am in Canadian Eastern woods, so mostly willow, pine, maple, birch etc.</p>

<p>The other question is...the wood itself burns hot enough for cooking, so what is the purpose of store bought charcoal?</p>
","<p><strong>No</strong>, it is <em>not</em> safe to burn just <em>any</em> kind of wood, because some woods contain toxins that have the potential to be fatal if inhaled as ash (poison oak, poison ivy). However, most wood found in nature is safe.</p>

<p>There's no such thing as smoke that <em>won't</em> cause damage to the lungs, smoke is a particle, your body has many levels of defense to try and prevent particles of <em>anything</em> from getting into your lungs (nose hairs, sinuses, mucus, coughing, sneezing), but they aren't exactly impenetrable defenses, a little bit of smoke won't hurt you, but avoid directly breathing the smoke from a fire.  </p>

<p>As far as cooking over wood, while bad in your lungs, smoke can actually be very tasty on your tongue, of the four types of wood you listed <strong>maple</strong> would be the best to cook with because it will flavour your food as well as cook it. Best fish I've ever tasted while camping was cooked over a maple wood fire. Pine would be one of my last choices for a cooking fire, as well as any other soft wood, because soft woods burn faster and seem to release more ash into the air which ends up on your food. </p>

"What are the odds that I stand a chance against Wild Boars?","9893","","<p>I have been trekking and camping since last 6 yrs. I have over 600 hikes and about 30 technical rock climbs under my belt. We often tend to camp up in forests, and at our sides, wild boars are pretty normal. Though I have never been under an attack by a wild boar, I just want to know that instead of running away (never in a straight line though), do I stand a chance to pretend to be aggressive if they out-number me? Few of the civilians suggested that it works most of the times if they out-number you. They loose their formation and run away. I just want to know if such a thing happened and/or (deliberately) done by anyone? How safe is it? </p>
","<p>I have come across wild boars about a dozen times (I admit, not that much), in numbers from a single male, mothers with young upto groups of 30-40 and I've never felt threatened. Sometimes the leading (fe)male might approach you aggressively just long enough for the rest of the group to run away and then retreat too. I usually stay silent and try to observe them, which has upto now not been seen as a thread or provoked any aggression. While this is probably no different than your own experience, I have too always anticipated the ""what if"" scenario. What I keep in mind is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Will I be able to distract them by throwing away a jacket or backpack ?</li>
<li>If running/climbing something is no option, how can I or we look bigger than we are and scare them off.</li>
<li>If they attack and you can't get away, how to avoid them hitting your thigh. I believe the main risk for boars is their tusks piercing your thigh and artery which can cause you to bleed to death much quicker than getting help is possible.</li>
</ul>

<p>update:</p>

<p>It may be worth taking into account that in some places animals can become more agressive as they lose their  fear of humans. Here in Europe hunters may feed animals to create artificial overpopulations, which in some places has resulted in the boars affiliating humans with food. Where this is the case, they are much harder to intimidate and scare off.</p>

I don't necessarily want to know the exact minute of the day, but a general idea of how many hours are left until sunset would be helpful. If it's very cloudy or stormy, do I have any hope of knowing the time of day?</p>
","<p>A nice rule of thumb that I've used is to hold you hand out at arms length, with the first four fingers of your hand parallel to the ground. Your finger's width represents about 15 minutes of sunlight. So, for example, if I held up my hand and measured about 10 finger widths from the horizon to the current location of the sun, there would be somewhere around 150 minutes, or 2 and a quarter hours, of sunlight left.</p>

<p>This obviously only works as a good guess, and as you approach the poles it gets less reliable. There is also the question of your finger size. Someone with very small or very large fingers will get different results. I've had good success with it by rounding up on my guesses (I have small hands).</p>

So what causes them to expire? Are they still safe to use after their expiration date?  That is, will they be dangerous or will they just not be as effective?</p>
","<p>There are two common chemical options to water purification; chlorine and iodine. Both forms use some kind of expiration date.</p>

<p>The consensed quantity of the chemical slowly degrades. Some things like sunlight cause the degradation process to speed up, so these are usually packaged in foil (as in your case) or brown glass bottles. Different recipes and forms cause different degredation speeds, the people who have studied the numbers published the expiration date you are looking at.</p>

<p>The expiration date is usually a safe date for the tablet when stored properly (temperature, moisture, sunlight, etc). That means you can probably go a few months past the date and not worry about anything. theoretically you could use larger quantities of tablets that are much older but that's dangerous territory and not very weight conscious. The reality is the tablets are cheap enough that whenever possible you should buy new.</p>

<p>When I did my first Himalayan trek, my guide there had told me that those with a low blood pressure (BP) are more susceptible to Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS). The logic according to him was that low BP along with high altitude will result in the blood flow to the brain reducing further and the symptoms of AMS are more likely to occur at an earlier stage in those with a low BP.</p>

<p>Hence, is there a scientific relationship between BP(either low or high) and AMS? </p>

<p>Please try to include references for the answers.</p>
","<p>There is no documented scientific relationship between individual blood pressure and AMS.  Furthermore, your guide appears to be completely mis-informed as to the mechanics of AMS.  The most common symptom of AMS - a roaring headache - is caused by swelling of the brain as the body attempts to make up for reduced oxygen in the blood by pumping harder and faster (hence an increased heart rate).

We would like to go on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gro%C3%9Fer_Priel"" rel=""noreferrer"">Großer Priel</a>, 2515&nbsp;m. The plan is to go for three days (sleeping two nights in a tent on a snow).</p>

<p>She has enough experience (for her age) going to the mountains. Also she is physically strong. She has a winter sleeping bag, and it was already tested during autumn.</p>

<p>I would like to ask if there are any special reasons <strong>why not to go with small kid to mountains in winter</strong>? For example, from medical point of view. Maybe small kids could immediately freeze.</p>

<hr>

<h1>Because of the big interest in this topic I'll write a short summary based on the answers:</h1>

<h1><em>First of all I decided to reconsider the route!</em></h1>

<h2>The following risks await a kid in the mountains in winter based on their importance (according to my opinion). Most important listed first:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Inability to function alone. Kid should be, let's say, self-contained during an emergency situation (should be able to call emergency\setup emergency locator, should be able to carry a sleeping bag and emergency shelter all the time, should be able to find a suitable place and set it up in a wind\storm, be mentally tough, etc.).</li>
<li>Bigger risk of hypothermia because of small body volume.</li>
<li>Experience of the guide.</li>
<li>Deep snow is very hard for short legs.</li>
<li>Equipment. Proper equipment in mountains is a must.</li>
<li>Risk of avalanches and dependency on weather. There is no direct correlation between kids and avalanches/weather. It's a danger for everyone.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>There are a lot of comments about mountain experience. This topic is not to judge my experience and the experience of my daughter. But anyway, I would like to share what experience my daughter has:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I decided to <strong>reconsider the route</strong>, so don't be afraid.</li>
<li>All the kids are different. This is very important! My daughter is physically very strong. She is doing 15 push-ups and 3 pull ups. She can swim a swimming pool length under the water on one breath.</li>
<li>She has experience sleeping at 2500&nbsp;m in a tent during autumn.</li>
<li>Close to our apartment we have a forest and small hills. So we are training to walk with heavy backpacks at night. She is very excited that we are going somewhere.</li>
</ul>
","<p>Other people have addressed several concerns that I would have bringing a young child into the mountains during the winter. One concern that I haven't seen addressed is; what if something happens to you because <strong>the average 6 year old is going to be <em>entirely</em> dependent on you</strong>. If you become compromised for any reason the child more than likely isn't going to be able help you or fend for themselves effectively. While it is certainly true that accidents can happen anytime of the year, winter is unquestionably more risky. </p>

<p>If you're going to take a 6 year old into the mountains in the winter apart from all the other precautions that people mentioned I'd highly recommend that you don't take the child without them being able to do the following things <strong>efficiently in storm/adverse conditions</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Access and activate an emergency locator beacon that they have on their person at all times.</li>
<li>Be able to carry on their person at all times, an emergency shelter that they can setup/use in storm/adverse conditions and live in alone for at least a couple days</li>
<li>Be able to recognize what is the best location they can reach to wait and setup their emergency shelter for a rescue (ie don't setup camp on a cornice)</li>
<li>Be able to leave you broken/bleeding/unconscious/dieing/etc to setup their emergency shelter in a safe location to ensure their survival because they recognize they don't have the strength/skills to help you</li>
<li>Be mentally tough enough to not leave the emergency shelter during a storm even if that storm lasts for over 24 hours, and they're alone, and they're ""sure"" they hear you moaning for help.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you can be confident that your 6 year old child can do all of those things then I'd say you have a very unique child. If they can't then you need to decide for yourself if your child's <strong>almost certain death in the snow, in the event of an accident</strong>, due to fate or your miscalculation, is worth the risk.</p>

<hr>

<p>As an aside another risk with children is putting them in a situation that is uncomfortable and makes them not want to do similar activities in the future. For example if the first trip a young kid takes skiing they get cold, wet, and fall constantly they aren't going to be excited to go again. If the first several times they go skiing they are warm, comfortable, and get to drink extra hot chocolate they'll be more forgiving with the intermittent wet, cold, and generally crummy day. If you do decide to take your daughter out snow camping I'd recommend you do absolutely everything in your power to make it go off without a hitch or you're going to have a hard time getting a second chance.</p>

"How should I prepare my body for prolonged exposure to heat?","9770","","<p>Today I hiked for about 4 hours, and I ended up with sun stroke (terrible headache, trembling etc.). The heat was moderate (about 30°C, 86°F in shade), and the way was half in forest. I had a baseball cap on my head and I drank a lot (about 2.5 liter water). I was not dehydrated, judging from urine amount/color. So in theory, I did what was necessary to prepare myself. However, it seems that my body was overwhelmed in spite of this.</p>

<p>Is there anything I can do to prepare my body for heat? The people on Savanna, for example, are living with much higher temperatures and full day exposure to sun, and I wouldn't handle that in my today's condition. Is this a genetic factor, or it can be trained, for example sauna, intensive exercises or simply exposure to heat?</p>
","<p>There are a few things that influence your body's ability to regulate heat. Nutrition, clothing, behavior, and practice are the big ones. </p>

<p>Nutrition is important as far as making sure you're properly hydrated and are replete with electrolytes. It's possible to become dehydrated even while drinking enough water. To fix this, make sure you consume salts such as sodium chloride, potassium chloride, or others you can read about here <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolyte#Physiological_importance"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolyte#Physiological_importance</a>. </p>

<p>Clothing is important as well, and is easy to do incorrectly if you're unfamiliar with how. You've mentioned you're in a forest, which means you don't have to worry about providing your own shade. Focus on wearing lightweight clothing which allows ventilation. Generally, do not wear cotton. It will absorb several times its weight in water, allowing chafing while preventing your sweat from properly evaporating off your skin. The sweat must evaporate from your skin or a layer of clothing near your skin in order to cool you off; this is called evaporative cooling. Underclothing should also not be cotton, again due to chafing and because your groin is just about the warmest part of your body. Soaked cotton allows much less airflow than soaked wool or synthetics. Wool or wool blend socks are usually best at providing ventilation for your feet to reduce blisters and overheating. The baseball cap you mentioned before is probably also a bad idea, especially if it's cotton. A wide-brimmed hat capable of providing shade while still allowing ventilation is a much better idea. Your head generates a lot of heat, and must be allowed to properly reject it to the atmosphere in order to avoid overheating your brain. </p>

<p>Behavior is a much more simple category for improvements. Stay in shade, move slowly, and move even more slowly if you start to feel hot. Do not hesitate to take a break in the shade. In fact, take a break before you feel like you need to. Don't wipe sweat away unless you must. The sweat must remain on your skin to be effective. If you're producing excess sweat to where you're dripping, it may make sense for comfort reasons to wipe it away, but you wouldn't want to keep, say, a towel with you to clear your brow every few seconds.</p>

<p>Practice is even simpler. Exposing your body to heat while exercising will generally cause you to thermoregulate more effectively. Your body will produce more blood and vasodilate more readily, allowing the blood at the surface of your skin to ""donate"" larger amounts of heat to the air (if below 38 degrees) or to evaporating sweat (if between 38 and 100 degrees (I really hope you're not going anywhere over 100 degrees)). This is how you see people who live in the tropics or mediterranea go about their day comfortably without sweating like a northerner does. </p>

<p>TL;DR:

"Cheese and eggs on backpacking trips","9738","","<p>I have taken some hard cheeses onto backpacking trips quite successfully without spoilage, but I have not dared taking more than I can eat in about 3 days. Eggs I have not dared to take. I am interested in how long people have gone in arid climates before their cheese/eggs became inedible. I don't mind sweaty cheese or even some mold, but I do not care much about food poisoning in the backcountry.</p>
","<p><strong>Cheese</strong>:</p>

<p>Long time. Especially hard cheeses. You can just cut any mold off the edge that might creep up. Cheeses sealed in cheese wax (gouda) are a good bet.</p>

<p>I've had extra-sharp cheddar un-refrigerated in the AZ desert for 8+ days, in the rocky mountains for 15+ days with no issues (aside from sweat.)</p>

<p>Blocks last longer than a pile of shredded cheese.</p>

<p>Be smart. Keep an eye on it. If it smells foul, don't eat it.</p>

<p><strong>Eggs</strong>:</p>

<p>With shells intact, raw eggs last surprisingly long.</p>

<p>In the Borneo rain forest (just below the equator = hot) we would get pallets of 300+ raw eggs shipped up to camp that we would store, un-refrigerated in the shade, for 30 days at a time. (This was after however long un-refrigerated in the truck, the shop, and the supply boat...)</p>

<p>Sure, there was some spoilage - but a very small percentage. Just crack them into a separate container first before tossing them in your dish.</p>

<p>Or use an old farmers test: put your raw eggs in a bucket of water, ""If they sink, they're safe. If they float, they fail.""</p>

<p>Other people suggest cracking the eggs into a sterilized lexan bottle (rinse with bleach first) and then freezing (or not). These reportedly last for several days. (&lt;-I have not tried this).</p>

<p>As a distant last option -- they are doing some pretty decent things with powdered eggs these days...</p>

<hr>

<p><em>Caveat: These are my personal experiences. I am sure there are some official FDA guidelines and other related official paranoia. Possibly even tails of death and disease from eating day old cheese. Fine. Follow those if you choose.

"If you are buried in an avalanche will you survive?","9683","","<p>Obviously, my best chance of survival is in <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/7217/what-is-the-first-thing-to-do-when-buried-in-an-avalanche/7221#7221"">not being buried</a>, but if I am unfortunate enough to become buried in an avalanche what are my chances of surviving it?</p>
","<p>There have been quite a few studies on this. There are various factors that will affect this, these include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Position in the snow: people upside-down sometimes live longer because the brain has more blood flow</li>
<li>Equipment you may be carrying (aqualung, etc.)</li>
<li>Injuries or bleeding: if you bang your head you could be dead before the avalanche even stops, etc.</li>
<li>Type of ground the avalanche happens on: people may not be able to safely get to you or you could be ""washed"" off a cliff, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Baring the above your chances of survival are linked to the <strong>time spent buried under snow</strong>.</p>

<p>That all said, the good news is you will likely survive under the snow longer than you think:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The only finding giving grounds for optimism is that the initial
  survival probability is much higher than previously assumed. Indeed,
  of the 123 skiers extricated within 15 min, only 8 were dead and,
  moreover, only 2 had died of asphyxia (extrication times 10 and 15
  min), whereas the remaining 6 skiers had all sustained fatal injuries
  during descent of the avalanche.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The important time frame is the first 15-35 min:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The survival probability then plummets from <strong>92% at 15 min</strong> to only <strong>30%
  at 35 min</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The rate of survival then typically slowly decreases. One factor in this slowing of the death rate is the effects of the cold on metabolic rates:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is known that the snow cover prevents rapid hypothermia (maximally
  3 degrees C per hour) and that oxygen consumption decreases
  significantly with lowering of the body temperature and loss of
  consciousness</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By the time you get to 130 mins the survival rate is only 3%.</p>

<p>If you're lucky enough to survive intact in an avalanche, ""death is (typically) due to a combination of ""slow asphyxia"" and hypothermia.""</p>

<p>So the important thing to remember is to find and get people out as fast as possible (while still staying safe yourself). ""Professional help should be sought immediately after, but not during, the (15 min) critical phase.""</p>

<hr>

<p>As MichaelKjörling says below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you can summon help immediately after someone is buried in an
  avalanche, without leaving the site, I would argue that doing so is
  probably better. Cell phone, emergency light, radio, anything you have
  on hand to draw attention to the predicament. Even a ski stuck in the
  snow might very well help</p>

"How to freeze a water container without deforming it?","9623","","<p>I like to take a frozen Nalgene bottle of water to my Bikram Yoga class. The problem is, every bottle I have used so far becomes deformed and, as can be seen in the picture below, the bottom bulges out making it difficult or impossible for it to stand upright until some of the ice melts and it pops back in.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GHJLX.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Eventually, the exposure to expanding substance over time causes the bottle to break. What can I do to freeze my water without deforming the container?</p>
","<h1>Don't fill the container</h1>

<p>You can't win in a battle against the laws of physics. Water expands when it freezes, so you need to leave some room in your bottle for it to expand into. What I find works best is to <strong>fill your bottle just over half</strong>, then <strong>freeze it <em>on its side</em></strong>. <em>This will give the ice more room to expand than if you freeze it upright.</em> When you grab your bottle from the freezer, top it up with cold water; the ice being frozen along the length of your bottle will rapidly cool the water, and you'll have a easier time getting water out when you want a drink. </p>

<p>Apparently, if you're trying to rappel in a situation where you have to leave gear at the top to get down safely: use a Rap Ring.</p>

<p><strong>How do you use a Rap Ring to rappel?</strong> (I would appreciate images of any complex knots or gear setup involved.)</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5rRCU.jpg"" alt=""simple metal ring""></p>
","<p>It's not complicated. Let's say you're using a long piece of webbing to build the anchor. Before you tie the ends of the webbing to make a loop, you put the webbing through the rap ring. Then when you form the loop, the ring is linked into it. When you form the master point of the anchor (i.e., the loop that you would normally put a locking biner through), you do it so that the rap ring is there in the master point. Now you rappel off of the rap ring.</p>

<p>To make sure you don't lose the rope, you go through the usual procedure of tying the middle of the rope to something before you throw the ends down. Then before you rap off, you remove the knot so that you'll be able to pull the rope down at the bottom.</p>

<p>All you're leaving behind is the webbing and the rap ring, both of which are cheap to replace. Having the rap ring lets you avoid leaving behind a locking biner, which is more expensive. Sometimes you will see anchors that have been permanently left in place (e.g., on canyoneering routes), and what's left behind is a rap ring.</p>

"Where should a band be tied to stop bleeding from wound?","9589","","<p>Suppose a leg is wounded (either from a gunshot or a knife) and there is significant bleeding. We see in movies that a fabric is tied around the place of bleeding to decrease/stop bleeding.  </p>

<p>My question is: <em>where</em> should you apply the tight bandage, exactly <em>on</em> the wounded spot, <em>above</em> the wounded spot, or <em>below</em> the wounded spot?</p>

<p>The context is that you are in The Great Outdoors where you cannot promptly get a trained medic to help and you need to use your first-aid equipment to treat the wound yourself.</p>

<p>Please also provide explanation. Thanks. </p>
","<p>""tight bandage/band"" = Tourniquet.  An emergency tourniquet is generally used as a last resort, especially in civilian applications, for all blood flow below the application of an emergency tourniquet is stopped, and can subsequently kill the tissue, leading to eventual loss of the limb below application.  <strong>Never attempt to apply a tourniquet unless you are qualified to do so. A tourniquet is a last resort to stop bleeding and is used to save life at possible loss of limb.</strong></p>

<p>Where: place a 2 inch or wider tourniquet 2-4 Inches from the wound towards the heart.  <strong>Never wrap your tourniquet directly around a wound, fracture, or joint. Doing so may cause severe pain and permanent physical damage to the patient.</strong></p>

<p>Place some sort of padding underneath the tourniquet and wrap the tourniquet material around the limb several times.  Use a torsion device such as a strong stick-like instrument that is 1 foot or longer. Tie an overhand knot over your torsion device, and then tie another. This will ensure that you have reached the torsion necessary to stop the bleeding entirely.  Tighten the torsion device by twisting it in one direction until the material is tight around the limb and/or the bright red bleeding has stopped.  Tie the loose ends of the tourniquet around the ends of the torsion device. This will help to ensure that your tourniquet does not loosen.</p>

<p><strong>Please do understand that</strong> Two hours is considered the length of time a tourniquet can be in place before neuromuscular injury and functional loss begin. For applications longer than 2 hours, cooling the limb may help delay injury and loss of function. <strong>The best method to save a limb is rapid transport and converting to a less-damaging means of hemorrhage control as soon as practicable.</strong> [Walters TJ, Mabry RL.

Would it be worth a try or can I be sure it doesn´t work as well as climbing shoes?</p>

<p>_  </p>

<p>Of course, you would need to train your feet to get the strength you need. But considering the amount of training climbers put into their hands and fingers for things like ""one-finger-holes"" I think this is probably no good reason for not trying it with your feet...</p>

","<p>I climb barefoot and in vibram five-fingers (KSO's), climbed in them for the first time in 2008 and loved them, where they excel is in roofs and overhanging problems because you can hook holds a lot easier with your toes, but for tougher wall climbing with small features (5.11+) I still use climbing shoes.  </p>

<p>Vibram five-fingers don't work very well for edging, so you have to change your footwork when you're climbing in them and think of your feet more as another pair of hands. The technique I use is to basically smear your foot on the front of the hold and use you toes to crimp on the top of it, you'll get some pretty bad cramps in the bottom of your feet while you're training them, so roll out on a tennis ball after.

<p><strong>What are common climbing techniques for strongly overhanging walls and roofs?</strong></p>

<p>In order to avoid a strength oriented climbing style and focus on technique.</p>
","<p>Here are a couple</p>

<h2>Climb on your Skeleton</h2>

<p>Overhanging climbing is hard work and tiring. You need to reduce the stress on your muscles by letting your skeleton hold as much of your body weight as possible. Keep your arms straight and your muscles relaxed, don't try and hold yourself against the face. Pull only when you need to pull</p>

<h2>Use your shoulders/Twist your body</h2>

<p>When reaching on overhanging terrain in order to make better use of your skeleton (above), if you twist your body (for example) to the left with your (for example) right hand straight, your left hand will be able to reach further without you pulling with your right bicep. This allows you make tough moves with the lowest amount of effort.</p>

<h2>Keep moving</h2>

<p>Unless your Adam Ondara your going to get more tired on overhanging terrain. Try and keep moving. If you have to keep stopping to work out moves, etc. your going to run out of energy. Visualise the moves, etc. before you start. this will save energy when you get to the moves as you won't have to try and figure them out when you get to them, all the time wasting energy.</p>

<p><strong>Foot work is even more important on overhanging terrain.</strong></p>

<h2>Keep your feet up</h2>

<p>Don't let your feet fall behind your hands. If your too stretched out you will swing away from the wall and you'll have to pull hard to get back on it. You want your knees bent most of the time.</p>

<h2>Use your feet to hold weight</h2>

<p>You can't expect your hands to hold your entire body weight for an extended period of time. You need your feet to hold as much of your weight as possible. To do this you need to tense your core. This requires core strength(stomach/back) which may take some time to build. You also may need to use techniques such as heel hooks. The idea being that your feet are working to actively hold you against the wall rather than simply being along for the ride!</p>

"Are dark or bright clothings preferable in the desert?","9403","","<p>Natives from regions which are really hot and have a high sun intensity are wearing sometimes white/bright and sometimes black/dark colors.</p>

<p>I mean there has to be a better strategy in terms of heat budget and radiation protection (which seem to be the two main enemies).</p>

<p>Black absorbs the heat most so the clothing gets hotter. I've read that the difference is low when you wear your stuff very loosely like the Bedouin and other desert dwellers do. That being said black clothing is said to protect better against sunburn. I don't know why though.</p>

<p>No major advantages for any color? </p>

<p>I could think of ethnic/cultural/religious reasons but in my opinion comfortable living should be the main reason for a choice.</p>

<p>E.g. <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/a/1653/2653"">here</a> is said bright clothing wins. If you have a look at the nature the bright=cool, black=hot works also. E.g. the Namaqua chameleon regulates the temperature with its color:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.ingrids-welt.de/reise/nam/bilder/kuelittle11.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.ingrids-welt.de/reise/nam/bilder/kuelittle11.jpg</a></p>
","<p>I have always been advised to be in bright/light colours during the trekking expeds in regions which are known for bad sun.  </p>

<p>Everybody knows that Black clothing absorbs more heat(radiation). The lighter you wear, the lesser heat you attract(radiation). Now there is a point rightly said above that the darker colours will emit it faster as well, but the media for emission is very important. We, human, emit the body heat in the form of sweat (usually, the most of the times). After a certain amount/threshold, Sweating is trouble-making. The more you sweat, the more body-necessary fluid you loose rapidly.</p>

<p>The physics, or I should say, the physiology of that is something like this:
Perspiration is our major Thermoregulation mechanism. The more you exert (Specifically, out in the sun, not resting), the more your muscles heat up due to exertion, more sweat is produced, the more fluid you loose. How the sweat is produced? When the gain of the hypothalamic feedback system increases in response to the increased body temperature, the more Perspiration is needed. And, sweat contains majorly Water, then Minerals, may be Urea (hence Salt??)
In that case, the darker your clothes are, Higher is your skin temperature, and so higher is the Perspiration rate.</p>

<p>Now, addressing to the example you have posted above, it says that, the Namaqua chameleon regulates the temperature with its color, yeah agreed, but there are a lot complicated points about hydrating and body-temperature maintaining phenomena and mechanisms in Cold Blooded animals, typically the Reptiles. You can't directly co-relate their phenomena with our body-temperature maintaining mechanism, Because reptiles are Ectotherms, they get their body heat from outside (external environment), and they lack the ability to generate heat in the body, unlike Humans for that matter..</p>

<p>And, I honestly don't have much wisdom about dressing sense of the desert dwellers. But, I can ask you to observe a thing about it: Those (beautiful, if you can say so) women wearing a <a href=""http://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burqa"">Burqa</a>, their skin tends to get reddish as they spend time in sun wearing  the Burqa. Can you think of the Reason??? Heat may be?
Nonetheless, the attire they prefer to follow has deeper roots in traditional sense, but again, that has been the way for nearly centuries now, and these people being experiencing all of it's stuff definitely know what and why they are doing it.</p>

<p>Go for Brighter colors when you plan to trek at any place where there you are expecting the temperature to be above you body temperature by 4-5 Degree Celsius.</p>

"How should I remove a leech?","9302","","<p>Once a leech is attached, what is the proper way to remove it?  </p>

<p>(I'm assuming that the method would generic for all leeches, but if there are special kinds, please note that).</p>
","<p>I used to think I knew the answer to this, from having a couple of very small leeches, but this guidance from wildmadagascar.com is quite comprehensive:</p>

<ul>
<li>Identify the anterior (oral) sucker which will be found at the small end of the leech.Put your finger on your skin adjacent to the oral sucker</li>
<li>Gently but firmly slide your finger toward the wound where the leech is feeding. Using your fingernail, push the sucker sideways away from your skin.</li>
<li>Once you have dislodged the oral sucker, quickly detach the posterior (rear) sucker (the fat end of the leech). </li>
<li>Try flicking the leech or prodding with your fingernail.</li>
<li>As you work to remove the leech, it will attempt to reattach itself.</li>
<li>Keep the wound clean -- minor cuts in tropical climates can quickly become infected. The leech itself is not poisonous. The wound will itch as it heals.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are some popular methods of removal that are definitely not advised, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>holding a flame or a cigarette to the leech</li>
<li>using salt, vinegar, alcohol, cola etc</li>
</ul>

<p>These will cause the leech to quickly detach, but it will also regurgitate its stomach contents into the wound, possibly introducing disease!</p>

"Can I heat a shelter with fire?","9246","","<p>So I built my survival shelter and I decide a nice fire would really warm things up. Is there a way I can build a fire that would heat the shelter without too much smoke?

<p>Is there a way to build a fire to do this? Side note, I am assuming a typical low crawl in shelter, would there be a better one to use with fire?</p>
","<p>To avoid starting fire inside your shelter, you can do it outside and use a screen (sorry for my drawing):<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ATCQy.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>This is view from aside. On the upper picture there is a widely used method for sleeping under a screen (a piece of fabric). Screen is set above your sleeping place at 45 degrees and the heat is reflected from the screen towards you, so you are warm from almost any direction. I've tried this at -15 C and it worked like charm.</p>

<p>You can use the same idea - set a screen or a couple of them to ""focus"" the heat on your shelter (on the entrance hole, missing wall, whatever). This way you can't get all the heat your fire produces, but you'll be able to capture a good part of it. I haven't tried this in practice, though. You profit is that you don't need to worry much about your shelter, the fire gets enough oxygen and no smoke comes inside.</p>

<p>P.S. Ther is another drawing of the same method:</p>

<p><strong>When would actually one want to wear exactly cotton socks?</strong> </p>

<p>A few ideas come to mind, but they are just shooting in the dark:</p>

<li>in the city or short hikes, to retain moisture in the sock, and not fill the shoe with salt and grease</li>

</ul>
","<blockquote>
  <p>When would actually one want to wear exactly cotton socks?</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>Hygienic reasons where washing your socks hot (95 °C) and frequently is important.<br>
I guess the most common such reason (besides being doctor/nurse/...) is having a fungal infection. In that case in addition to the proper medication you should change your socks frequently (if they get moist even more often than daily) and wash them really hot so your feet do not get re-infected next time you wear those socks and get them moist.<br>
However, in that foot condition long hikes closed boots are not a good idea, so not sure whether this is an ""outdoor"" answer.<br>
I've successfully washed synthetics socks at 60 °C many times that were rated at 30 °C, but never tried out how they take washing at 95 °C. </p></li>
<li><p>I wear cotton socks a lot in everyday life, in winter also woolen socks. I prefer synthetic or wollen socks for longer (several days without time to properly dry boots) hiking tours because I'm afraid once the whole foot-sock-boot business is thoroughly moist (the only time I didn't get moist feet on hiking/skiing so far was a winter spent in Manitoba), the cotton socks would lead to more blisters because they are usually less soft/smooth than the woolen or synthetic socks.  </p></li>
<li><p>As to the retain moisture part, I'm not so sure how much that matters in a closed shoe/boot scenario: usually it is much easier to dry a cotton sock than getting the corresponding moisture out of the shoe.<br>
(I guess that is what you were driving at with the not fill the shoe with salt and grease sentence? - though for a leather shoe grease would probably be good, but neither salt nor moisture is.)</p></li>
<li><p>In the office, I keep a spare pair of (cotton) socks in case I get really soaked biking there (I prefer to change also synthetics socks if they are thoroughly wet). I rarely have cold feet, and drying cotton socks on my feet that are slightly moist after the bike ride to the office is no problem once I've changed the shoes (when sitting at the computer, I usually slip out of the office/lab shoes). </p></li>
<li><p>Yes they do have a decided price advantage, and in my experience they last at least as long as the synthetics socks. My woolen socks last longer but then I wear them less frequently.</p></li>
<li><p>If outdoors includes activities where you return indoors in the evening: I often wear cotton socks when working outdoors. I don't see a big difference whether I have to wash the socks because they are dirty or because they are dirty and moist.  </p></li>

"Is it dangerous to sleep in a tent alone in a forest in -20°C?","9208","","<p>Can I spend the night alone in a tent in a forest outside Stockholm in -20°C without risking my life?</p>

<hr>

<h2>The backstory</h2>

<p>From the end of January, I'm starting my studies in a suburb of Stockholm. I've decided to, if it turns out plausible, not rent an apartment, but live in a tent. (This is not out of frugality, but out of a will to try something new.)</p>

<p>I do have friends who I could visit once a week or so to prepare food and wash my clothes, so I think I can solve the practical problems, or at least those that I've come to think of. I'd camp in one of the forests, maybe 1 km from ""civilisation"". I'd have access to showers etc at university every day.</p>

<p>However: I don't want to freeze to death in my sleep! That's very important to me. I've read that the nights can get as cold as -20°C (-4°F). With the proper preparations, would this be a plausible way of living, at least for a month or so?</p>

<p>I do have camping experience, and have been hiking for three weeks, but only in summer.</p>
","<p>Yes, it is definitely doable.  -20&deg;C is only -4&deg;F.  The real question is whether it is doable by <i>you</i> at the level of discomfort and hassle you are willing to put up with.  Only you can answer that.  At best we can point out what the hassles and discomforts will be.</p>

<p>First, your fear of dying of cold in your sleep is silly.  You'd have to do something pretty stupid to die of hypothermia, and even that's not going to happen when you're inside the sleeping bag.  The main danger will be from frostbite, but that again would largely need stupidity to help it along, although that's easier to do than outright death from hypothermia.</p>

<p>Your tent will be a long term fixed installation you set up once at a time and conditions of your choosing.  You can therefore afford a larger and heavier tent with more stuff you bring in once.  Definitely get a tent you can stand upright in.  That will make changing clothes much quicker and more comfortable.  Since you should be able to keep water out of the tent, get a nice down sleeping bag and a few light blankets.  The down bag should be rated for most nights, then put the blankets on top for the few unusually cold nights.  Since again weight is not really a issue, get a full sleeping bag, not a mummy bag.  They are simply more comfortable.  Get a good insulating pad, and another two as backup.  Get a tent large enough to fit your sleeping bag and something to sit on next to it, like a folding chair.  Put something under the legs to spread out the weight to that they don't hurt the tent floor.  Get one of those rubber-backed mats people sometimes put just inside their doors and put it just inside your tent.  That allows a place to step with boots still on, then you can sit down on the chair with boots still on the mat to take them off.  The crud stays on the mat, which you can shake clean by reaching outside after having put on your down hut booties.</p>

<p>Some things are going to be a hassle.  At -4&deg;F you want to keep your gloves on whenever possible, but some tasks will be difficult that way.  You end up taking your gloves on and off a lot, trading off efficiency with cold fingers.  Get a pair of polypro glove liners.  They are thin and still allow many tasks to be done, but provide at least a little insulation.  Their main advantage is that any metal you touch won't immediately conduct the heet from your hand away.  Touching bare metal at -4&deg;F is a good way to get frostbite.</p>

<p>Be prepared for some discomfort no matter what equipment you have.  The toughest part will be getting yourself out of the sleeping bag in the morning.  You'll really have to will yourself to leave the warm comfort of the bag and get into the air at probably the coldest part of the day.  At some point you'll have to change your clothes and get undressed in the process.  That's going to be cold.  It won't be cold long enough to be any real danger, so it's really a mindset issue to get over.  Whether you can or not and are willing to push yourself in that way only you can say.</p>

<p>You say you have access to heated buildings during the day, so it would make things a lot simpler for you if you don't have to deal with cooking and eating at your camp.  Perparing food outside in the cold takes a lot longer than in a heated kitchen, severly limits what you can do, and may also risk predator encounters depending on what is around your area in the winter.</p>

"Dome tents vs popup tents, are there any inherent pros or cons besides price and ease?","9152","","<p>I was lucky enough to be given an almost new double skin popup tent.</p>

<p>Where I'm camping right now it's got windy a couple of times and rainy a couple of times.</p>

<p>A friend of mine who is camping in his (several seasons old) dome tent says he thinks they're an inherently better design than popup tents against wind.</p>

<p>But is this necessarily true? <strong>Is it generally considered that popup tents have a particular set of advantages and disadvantages in comparison to dome tents?</strong> ... apart from these points which I think are obvious:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dome is cheaper than popup.</li>
<li>Popup is quicker and easier to pitch, and arguably quicker and easier to stow (at least once you've learned how!)</li>
</ul>
","<p>The big advantage that classic dome tents will have with strong winds is the addition of the guy ropes. With a popup tent, in high winds the stress will be on the tent itself, with guy ropes the stress is on the ropes and (when erected properly) a certain amount is channelled down to the ground via the pegs.</p>

<p>Now this isn't to say popup tents will break the minute they hit a moderate wind - but the point I find most people don't consider much is that when popup tents <em>do</em> break, they use such a combination of internal poles / springs that they're near impossible to fix in the wilderness with tools you may have on hand. Quite simply, there's much more to go wrong, and much less chance of fixing it if it does.</p>

<p>If you apply this ethos to a dome tent in high winds, if something breaks it's very, very likely to be the guy ropes that go first (because they're what should take the brunt of the force.) If you awake the next morning to find a couple of guy ropes snapped, 10 minutes later they can be near as good as new with a short piece of paracord and a moderate knowledge of good knots.</p>

<p>Combining those together I'd say that at lest for serious use, popup tents are not as well suited to high winds as dome tents.</p>

"How do you repair a plastic kayak?","9004","","<p>So roughly a month ago my other half and I brought ourselves each a SOT plastic kayak, we've been out on the water for maybe 2 hours total paddling time, but mine filled up with water.</p>

<p>We found a hole, approx. 1cm by 0.4cm, in the seam of the plastic in one of the two rear drainage holes, <em>too small to get your hand down easily</em>. I am currently talking to the manufacturer about a replacement.</p>

<p>However this has lead me to wonder (outside of warranty) <strong>how would I go about repairing a hole in a plastic kayak?</strong> Varied sized holes, and temporary and permanent fixes, I understand will vary.</p>
","<p>The main issue with repairing plastic hulls is that is that most adhesives don't bond very well to the plastic. For temporary repairs duct tape is the way to go. Its quite adhesive and waterproof. If the hole is too big use the duct tape to secure something else waterproof (e.g plyboard or plastic) in place. If possible try and do both inside and out. </p>

<p>If you want to do a permanent repair there seem to be two options:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.westsystem.com/ss/molded-plastic-boat-repairs/"">Repair in a similar way to fiberglass</a>. I.e. Sand the surrounding area and apply a fiberglass patch and epoxy. The one significant difference is that the area around the hole should be flame treated before applying the patch by lightly heating with a propane torch or similar. This helps the epoxy bond to the surface. Be careful not to burn your boat though.</p>

<p>The alternative, more conventional, way is to <a href=""http://www.windriderforum.com/smf/index.php?topic=832.0"">melt/weld more plastic into the hole</a>. I suspect this is what a professional would do if you asked them to do the repair. <a href=""http://www.instructables.com/id/Fixing-a-plastic-polyethylene-kayak-with-a-hole-/"">Here's</a> another good article on it. For smallish holes you want to get some polyethylene welding rod (presuming the boat is polyethylene) for large holes you need to get a patch. The basic idea is to melt the rod into the hole using a hot air gun or hot metal. As you've melted two of the same material together this repair should be very strong.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I'm mainly a dinghy sailor so haven't actually repaired any plastic hulls. This is just based on my general understanding of boat repair and reading the internet.</p>

"Why would one aim off when navigating with a map and compass?","8950","","<p>Sometimes while navigating with map and compass, the advice is to aim off i.e. to aim either to the left or right of the intended destination, as opposed to straight for it.</p>

<p>Why and when would one want to do this?</p>
","<p>The reason is that you could miss your destination and hit a trail and know that you are almost there, but not know which way to turn.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/398uh.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/398uh.png"" alt=""diagram of aiming off""></a></p>

<p>If on the other hand you had gone for Point B in the first place, <strong>you would know that when you got there, you needed to turn left</strong>. That is why one would aim off.</p>

<p>This works well when you are going for  a single point on a well defined line like a trail or stream.</p>

<p>Note: </p>

<p>The error is exaggerated for artistic purposes, but if you were to go for the destination straight off, your margin on either side is how far you would be able to see the destination from. </p>

<p>On the other hand, while aiming for Point B, so long as one doesn't end up to the left of the destination, one is fine, and that is a much wider margin or error.</p>

"How harmful is the rising/setting sun?","8850","","<p>Often, while hiking, my companions and I treat the very early/late sun as being less harmful (as far as skin cancer and UV radiation are concerned).

I typically face upstream and use my hiking poles for stability. However, I'm not a fan of soggy boots, so I tend to go barefoot, which adds to the risk of slipping on slick rocks or stepping on a sharp edge.

I'm often going solo and on well maintained trails, but without a bridge at the streams. And because of leave-no-trace principles, I don't want to construct anything to cross on top of (e.g. fall a tree).</p>
","<p>It depends on how many crossings.  If very few, I do them barefoot and change.  If there are a lot of crossings in a short distance I have shoes that I just wear for the entire hike.  I'll cover both.</p>

<p><strong>General Rules</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>Don't use rocks if you can avoid it.  Stand <em>on the bottom</em> of the
river.  Just don't try rock hopping - you're asking for serious injury. (Yeah, I've done it too, without getting hurt, but it's a bad idea.)</li>
<li>Use a hiking pole (or two) for added stability.</li>
<li>Avoid funnels with rapid current.</li>
<li>If you feel unstable then put your rainfly on your pack and float it or, at the least, unbuckle the belt so you can ditch it if you go under the water.</li>
<li>When you step, wiggle your foot before putting weight on it.  If it's slippery try a different footing.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Barefoot</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Try to avoid stepping where you can't see.</li>
<li>Do not go barefoot in high traffic areas that could have broken glass.</li>
<li>Most river rocks aren't sharp, but use caution.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Shoes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>If there are so many crossing that it's not practical to change, I just hike in shoes.</li>
<li>Look for aerated shoes that will drain fast.  Find something that's still a good fit.  This will vary from person to person.  It seems that everyone I meet uses something and swears by it and there is nothing else possibly better ever...</li>
<li>Test first.  I do this with places that allow returns.  I put the shoes on <em>with socks</em> and hose them until soaked.  Then I walk five miles.  If my feet hurt, I return them.  I do take care to not beat them up in that five miles.</li>
</ul>

<p>We do Jack's River here in GA every year.  Last trip I used <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B003UNKJ4Q"">these</a> and they worked amazingly well for 16+ river crossings in 8 miles.

<p>The long answer: you can reduce the pressure in the fuel bottle, and this will reduce the flow rate of the fuel.</p>

<p>This is done by pumping fewer times! The exact number will vary over bottle size and amount of air in it--how full it is.</p>

<p>After you brought your pot to a boil, using the stove at regular pressure as per the manual, remove the pot from the stove and turn off the gas valve. Once the stove is off, take a hold of the bottle, hold it up vertically, and carefully unscrew the pump to release the pressure. <strong>Do this carefully, and be sure there is no flame immediately nearby, because if the fuel vapour lights up, you are going to have a very bad time.</strong> Once the pressure is released, re-seal the pump on the bottle, give it one or two pumps, open the fuel valve and relight the stove. If your flame is still too strong, repeat this procedure with fewer pumps. Ultimately, it's the pressure in the fuel bottle that determines the flow to the stove.</p>

<p><strong>The vapour coming out as you depressurize the fuel bottle can catch fire if you are not careful. You must be sure there are no fire sources nearby that will light it!</strong></p>

<p>Given the risk involved, I think it's best to avoid doing this. I have been able to make fancy rice, soup, sauce, eggs, pancakes, and other types of meals that benefit from simmering on this stove with regular operation. An easy solution is to simply elevate the pot higher over the fire. If you know you will be in a setting that calls for long-term simmering, then an LPG stove will do a much better job of it. </p>

"Why do seagulls circle around at high altitudes?","8755","","<p>I was recently at a music festival in a field here in the UK. It was a nice hot day and I was staring up into the lovely blue sky. I noticed there were high numbers of seagulls circling above, seemingly riding thermals to a great height (they quickly became speks in the sky).</p>

<p>I started wondering, what are they up to? I couldn't make sense of it. </p>

<p>If they were riding the thermals as a mode of transport, they didn't appear to be going anywhere (just round and round in circles). </p>

<p>It didn't make sense that they were doing it to spot food either (that I thought). There was plenty of food about, but none of them appeared to be making any attempt to come down. </p>

<p>It almost appeared that they were simply riding the thermals for fun.</p>

<p>So why would these birds by seemingly riding thermals for no reason? </p>
","<p>For the same reason carrion birds circle over fresh kills: They're waiting for an opportunity to swoop in and get some food. All the gulls see is a large gathering of humans, which typically means dropped chips, bits of hotdog buns, discarded scraps, leftovers on tables, people throwing bits for the birds. Wherever you have big gatherings of large mammals there will be flocks of scavengers. You'll see the same behaviours in nature too, scavengers will follow herds of deer or caribou waiting for one of them to either drop dead or get picked off by a predator so they can swoop down to pick away at what gets left behind. The reason they ride the thermals and circle overhead is so they can conserve energy while they watch and wait.</p>

"What are some good gluten-free foods for backpacking?","8509","","<p>I have quite unfortunately found out several months ago that I'm <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluten_sensitivity"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">gluten sensitive</a>. Nearly all my meals I've planned and eaten on the trail have included wheat, and thus gluten, in some fashion. I'm still learning how to eat satisfyingly gluten-free at home, and on the trail this has proven to be even more of a challenge.</p>

<p><strong>What are some good-tasting, calorie and nutrient-rich meals that I can pack on the trail that are gluten-free? For Breakfast, Lunch, and/or Dinner?</strong></p>

<p>Answers can include full-prep from raw ingredients, freeze-dried type meals, or any other variation.</p>
","<p>I follow a paleotic diet (which is gluten-free) for fairly similar reasons. I will give you some of my recommendations; I have tried them all myself except for the hard boiled eggs:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Beef jerky/pemiccan</strong>: it is very nutritious. It's my number 1 recommendation for food on the trail (regardless of whether you have celiac disease or not). You can <a href=""http://www.marksdailyapple.com/how-to-make-pemmican/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">make it yourself</a> if you want to. </li>
<li><strong>Dried fruit</strong>: water is heavy, so dried fruit is a lightweight and nutritious snack. A little bit sugary perhaps, but that shouldn't be a problem on the trail (when you're burning lots of calories). Raisins are my personal favorite in this category.</li>
<li><strong>Coconut oil</strong>: also very nutritious and high in healthy fats. You can eat it raw, cook with it or you can <a href=""http://www.freecoconutrecipes.com/index.cfm/2012/1/9/gluten-free-coconut-cookies"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">make cookies</a> with it.</li>
<li><strong>Honey</strong>: either raw or used in recipes.</li>
<li><strong>Raw nuts</strong>: again: nutritious and lightweight.</li>
<li><strong>Dried seaweed and kale</strong></li>
<li><strong>Hard boiled eggs</strong>: as long as you have a hard container that keeps the shell from breaking, they won't spoil for two to three weeks. That's what I've heard, at least, I haven't actually tried it myself yet.</li>
<li><strong>Canned sardines</strong></li>
<li><strong>Food bars</strong>: <a href=""http://tankabar.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Tankabars</a>, <a href=""http://thepurebar.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Pure Bars</a>, <a href=""http://www.kindsnacks.com/kind-store/buy-kind-bars"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kind Bars</a>, <a href=""http://www.larabar.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lara Bars</a>, and many others </li>

<li><strong>Vegetable chips</strong>: these <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B006RIELJ0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">carrot chips</a>, for instance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, most food in nature won't contain gluten. It's not something you should rely on (i.e. I would also take enough food with me), but some knowledge of the local fauna is always a good thing. However, it's <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/266/how-can-i-identify-edible-berries-fruit-from-poisonous"">a difficult subject</a>, but it just is one more option that you may be interested in.</p>

<p>It seems hard at first to find out which foods you can and cannot eat and to find good substitues for each of them, but you get used to this fairly easily. I at first thought that this would never be doable to head into the wild whilst following this diet (which is more restrictive than a gluten-free diet), and now I feel as if I've got more than enough options. After a while, it feels just as ""natural"" as your previous diet.</p>

"What are the consequences of — illegally — using a 446 MHz PMR in the North American wilderness?","8395","","<p>I've recently bought a pair of PMR446 walkie-talkies with some 5–10 km range, operating at 446 MHz.  We've happily used them in Sareks Nationalpark in Sweden.  Now I'm moving to Canada, where this frequency requires a license.</p>

<p>My options are to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Buy another pair for use in Canada</li>
<li>Get a license</li>
<li>Use them anyway without a license</li>
</ol>

<p>Suppose that we're hiking in a remote mountain region of British Columbia, Yukon, or Alaska.  In all likelihood, nobody is going to be nearby.  What are the likely consequences if we use it anyway — for us, and for others?  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=PMR446&amp;oldid=590068233#Usage_worldwide"">Wikipedia notes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>PMR446 radios use frequencies that in the U.S. and Canada are allocated to amateur radio operators. PMR446 radios can only be used in North America by licensed amateur radio operators. The conflicting allocations have been something of a nuisance to North American amateur operators due to use of the equipment by European tourists in the U.S. and Canada.[citation needed]</p>
  
  <p>Instead, the U.S. and Canada uses the FRS system, which provides a similar service on slightly different frequencies. FRS frequencies are allocated to the emergency services in Europe, notably the fire brigade in the UK, police in Russia.[2] Interference with licenced radio services may result in prosecution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Will PMR446 usage in North America likely lead to prosecution, and/or endanger anybody?</p>
","<p>In both the U.S. and Canada, amateur radio operators serve an important role in providing emergency radio communications during war, disaster, terrorist attack, or whatever other emergency. So amateur radio operators <a href=""http://www.n5fdl.com/davids-blog/2013/9/2/unlicensed-cheap-chinese-radios-can-cause-trouble.html"">take an extremely dim view of unlicensed operators</a> using frequencies allocated to amateur (or sometimes commercial) radio. Many will even hunt down unlicensed transmitters and report them to authorities. Radio Amateurs of Canada says that fines can <a href=""https://www.rac.ca/en/amateur-radio/regulatory/enforcement/"">""run to hundreds of dollars,""</a> but in the U.S., <a href=""http://www.arrl.org/news/florida-ham-issued-25-000-fine-for-operating-an-unlicensed-radio-transmitter-and-interfering-with-li"">fines <em>start</em> at $10,000 and go up dramatically</a> from there.</p>

<p>In the U.S., <a href=""http://www.arrl.org/band-plan"">446 MHz is used nationwide as a simplex calling frequency</a>, so if you are transmitting on PMR 446 channel 1 at 446.00625 MHz, you almost certainly <em>will</em> be noticed, and you probably will be noticed on any other channel. This frequency is also in <a href=""https://www.rac.ca/en/rac/services/bandplans/70cm/"">the band plan in Canada</a> for the same purpose.</p>

<p>If you can avoid doing so, it's a good idea to not use amateur radio frequencies without being licensed. It's not terribly difficult or expensive to become licensed, so it's an option worth looking into. Even so, in this band in both the U.S. and Canada amateur radio operators are <em>secondary</em> users of the band and must yield to primary users, such as...the U.S. military.</p>

<p>If you are close enough to a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAVE_PAWS"">PAVE PAWS military radar</a>, your PMR446 transmission also may interfere with it, since it uses the same frequency band. In your proposed travel, the nearest such installation is at the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clear_Air_Force_Station"">Clear Air Force Station</a> in Denali, Alaska. You do not want to mess with the US Department of Defense's ability to detect intercontinental ballistic missiles.</p>

<p><strong>My recommendation would be to replace the radios with FRS/GMRS radios</strong> and to keep the PMR446 radios, in case you ever return to Europe. (Note that GMRS does not require a license in Canada, but it does in the United States.)</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-Use_Radio_Service"">MURS</a>, which has been available in the U.S. for several years, was supposed to be introduced in Canada in 2014, but this has been <a href=""http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/eng/sf10822.html"">deferred indefinitely</a>. It has higher transmitter power limits (2 watts) and, interestingly, far fewer users, at least in the U.S. When these radios eventually do become available in Canada, this may make a good alternative to FRS/GMRS if you need <a href=""http://radiofreeq.wordpress.com/2013/07/07/survivalist-radio-communications-ham-vs-cb-vs-frs-vs-gmrs-vs-murs/"">longer range</a> or signal quality.</p>

<p>Interestingly, while searching the Internet in relation to this question, I learned that <a href=""http://www.cmlmicro.com/products/CMX883_Baseband_Processor_for_FRS_MURS_PMR446_and_GMRS_Leisure_Radios/"">some radio baseband processors can handle FRS, GMRS, MURS and PMR446 on the same chip</a>, so in principle a switchable radio could be built that would operate on FRS/GMRS or MURS in North America and PMR446 in Europe, but I was not able to find any such radio on the market. Such radios might appear on the market in the next few years, or I might need to search more thoroughly. It may also be illegal to market such a radio in some countries.</p>

<p>Along the same lines, many mass-market PMR446 radios have a nearly identical version with the same model number which is programmed for FRS/GMRS instead, so if you are happy with your existing radios, you can buy (nearly) identical ones that use FRS/GMRS.</p>

<p>Another option is to purchase a programmable radio, and program in the correct frequencies corresponding to FRS, GMRS, MURS or PMR446, depending on where you will use it. The two main problems with this approach are also legal: Such radios are usually certified as business radios and thus may not be entirely legal to operate unlicensed, and their power output may also be higher than is allowed for unlicensed operation on these frequencies. One popular example of such a radio is the <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B007H4VT7A"">Baofeng UV-5R</a>. In its low power mode it still transmits at 1 watt, higher than the maximum 500 mW allowed for FRS. It's less likely that you will be caught for this, but it is still possible.</p>

<li>Take a fine file or sandpaper and make sure there is only clean metal on the electrode tip. Often times these get corroded and dirty.</li>
<li>Use a Scotch-Brite pad or steel wool to clean the burner itself so that it also exposes clean metal. DO NOT use sandpaper on the burner.</li>
<li>Get some <a href=""http://www.walmart.com/ip/CNC-QD-Electronic-Cleaner-11-oz/16817418"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">electrical contact cleaner</a> and spray it directly into all orifices of the igniter. Also spray out the burner to clean out any dirt and dust. It's recommended that you wear gloves while doing this.</li>
<li>Shake the ignitor and the burner to remove any excess cleaner and let it dry for 10-15 minutes.</li>
<li>Reinstall the igniter in the stove and position the tip of the electrode about 1/4"" or closer from the surface of the burner.</li>
<li>Try to ignite and check for spark.</li>
<li>If you still don't get a consistent spark, <a href=""http://www.backcountry.com/jetboil-maintenance-kit"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">replace the igniter</a> with a new one.</li>
</ol>

<p>However my personal recommendation is forget the built-in igniter and keep the lighter (or other external ignition source), which has multiples uses, weighs very little, and is easily replaceable. The small built-in piezo-electric igniters all wear out rather quickly. I have a stove with one that no longer works and have friends with JetBoils with the same problem.</p>

<p>Also the replacement igniter is only $5.95. So in my opinion it's not worth trying fix the old one for that price if you don't want to depend on a lighter.</p>

"Why do many climbers appear to not trust their belay loops?","8327","","<p>The belay loop is the strongest part of the climbing harness, so why do so many climbers not trust it?<br>
It’s very common to see climbers backing up their belay loop with a separate piece of webbing or clipping their belay carabiner through the waist and leg tie-in points to avoid the belay loop. I’ve even seen some climbers cut the belay loops off their harnesses because they’re “old school” and never had a belay loop when they first started climbing.<br>
What I believe so far is that one could not possibly generate enough force by rappelling or holding a big lead fall to cause a belay loop to fail. Not even close. </p>

<p>Then Why Are Belay Loops Not Trusted?
When I started climbing I was asked to concede a fact that the Belay Loops are just there to hold the leg loops to the waist loop.</p>
","<p>I've seen this kind of behavior.</p>

<p>I think there's a tendency for people to want to continue to do things the way they're used to doing them, and the way they were originally trained.  It can be a little frustrating when someone comes along and tells you that the new ""right way"" to do something is different that what you've done before. </p>

<p>Also, if you're an experienced climber, you were probably trained several years ago.  When new recommendations enter the climbing community, they're introduced in books and training classes that are mostly taken by beginners.  So you have a situation where the people with the most up-to-date training don't have the context to fully understand what they've been taught, or necessarily apply it safely.  This makes experienced climbers unlikely to take their advice.</p>

<p>I've felt this myself - I used to rig a backup autoblock off my leg loop, until a friend convinced me to extend my rappel, and put the autoblock on my belay loop.  It was honestly hard for me to hear, because my friend was actually pretty inexperienced, and I'd been climbing for 3 years at that point.  But I eventually came around.</p>

<p>FWIW, I hope we can all at least agree that harness manufactures recommend that climbers use the belay loop to belay, and <em>both</em> tie in points when they're tying in or putting a sling or anchor chain on their harness.  At least that's what's indicated on this guide from <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20131029101238/http://www.petzl.com/us/outdoor/advice-on-harness-use_us"" rel=""nofollow"">Petzl</a>.  Other things may be safe, but I'd want to see some indication that they were at least <em>tested by the manufacturer</em> before doing it.</p>

<li>Being comfortable and without big technical difficulties (in respect to the skills of each person in the party) this earns a lot of speed. This is often done in steep ice or on easier to medium difficult rock climbs (common e.g. on UIAA III or IV climbs)</li>

<li>If there is no risk of crevasses, this can only make sense if you walk e.g. on a snow ridge where you have no possibility to use protection: In case one falls, the roped-in friend has to react very fast and jump on the other side of the ridge. This is very difficult and therefore needs experience. I was told this should only be done by mountain guides going behind the client.</li>

<li><strong>Moving without protection not being roped together</strong>

<ul>
<li>No backups. You have to feel absolutely comfortable with the terrain you are moving in.</li>

<hr>

<p>For me it looks very unlikely to have hidden crevasses in the terrain seen in the picture. So for option (3) it is much more likely that the roping together introduces a much higher risk here than going without rope. Especially if you tie in 5 people (!) it is not very likely that the members will hold the party if somebody falls. It will be more like a chain reaction with very fatal consequences, not only for the one who falls, but for the whole party.</p>

<p>I once was guided in South America on rocky terrain in a five-member party without using protection. For me this is similarly a no-go but the guide said it's OK and he does it all the time. For me this is not the way to move in the mountains, but opinions differ.</p>

<p>I say you use one of the options (1), (2) or (4) depending on how comfortable you feel in respect to the experience and skill level of all (!) members of the party. If you can't find a conclusion the way to react is: don't ascend further - return to a route which is safer for your group.</p>

<p>For me it seems that the wall is not that steep so that option (1) is too slow. Especially if you only have 1 rope for 5 people. So I would either search for spots to use mobile protection to place a camelot or nut. Or I would try to find rocks to guide the rope properly - descriped in (2). The only good alternative for me is that everybody feels safe and all are moving unroped (4).</p>

"What to teach someone who wants to start lead climbing?","8311","","<p>I have a friend who climbs with another group.
She recently had her first couple of experiences as lead climber (sport climbing).</p>

<p>I'm concerned that she doesn't have the required theory for lead climbing, and whenever possible I lecture her on <a href=""/questions/tagged/knots"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged 'knots'"" rel=""tag"">knots</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/safety"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged 'safety'"" rel=""tag"">safety</a> or whatever I can come up with.</p>

<p>For example, she was unaware that the rope-carabiner in a quickdraw should face <a href=""http://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/quickdraws-slings-webbing.html"">away from the direction of travel</a>. And for all I know, her group uses a very small subset of common <a href=""http://web.mit.edu/spelunk/www/rope-calls.html"">rope calls</a>.</p>

<p>Fortunately, she's eager to learn, and she's an avid reader.</p>

<p>However, being <em>mostly</em> a self-taught climber, I find it hard to sum up all the basics you need to know.</p>

<p>Other than lending her my books, <strong>what are the essential key-points she should be taught?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Edited</strong> to add that this is for sport climbing.</p>
","<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: Climbing is considered a dangerous activity. No written material can substitute proper teaching. The following is a just a list of topics, but you should seek a professional instructor.</p>

<p>There are quite a few important things, assuming you mean sport-leading (trad climbing involves more):</p>

<ol>
<li>Quickdraws: understand about gate directions, z-clipping, reverse-clipping, rope-travel, and rope-drag. Practice clipping techniques.</li>
<li>Belay device: auto-locking (grigri) vs. standard friction device. Rope feeding technique,  assessing slack in the system, when to feed out more slack and when to ""listen"" to the rope (e.g. be ready to catch a fall.)</li>
<li>Lead belaying: feeding out rope, amount of rope to feed (slack), how to do it (see belay device,) belayer position and stance (safe location, ready to be yanked/jerked by sudden tension/pull due to a big fall), catching falls (work on soft/dynamic catch, possibly jumping), <em>never</em> letting go of the brake hand (<a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/q/14455/2199"">PBUS</a>), spotting until first bolt is clipped.</li>
<li>Communication: ""Clipping!"", ""Clipped!"", ""Falling!"" in addition to standard climbing phrases.</li>
<li>Lead Climbing: clipping bolts (at waist height unless there's a good reason to do otherwise, clipping rope without putting finger through gate (lots of practice), quickdraw orientation (biner gate facing away from rock,) rope management (with respect to feet in particular,) <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/5657/learning-to-fall-when-leading-what-is-good-fall-technique"">falling</a> (being ready to land, watch your ankles, wrists, head, etc.)</li>
<li>Anchors: full top-rope anchor vs. double-quickdraw vs. cordellete, in addition: standard anchor stuff (SERENE, understanding direction and distribution of load, etc,) cleaning anchors (safely, personal anchor system, how to transition from belay to PAS and back safely)</li>
<li>Multi-pitching, belaying from the top (using grigri, using auto-blocking (reverso, atc guide)), belaying from an anchor (as a second), cleaning as a second</li>
<li>Understand dynamic ropes, fall factors, stretch, etc.</li>
<li>Explain foam helmets (protection in fall, not just from rockfall from above), belay gloves</li>
<li>Knots: clove/full hitch (for use as personal safety using the rope attached to your harness), munter/half hitch (emergency belay, say, if you dropped your belay device...), right-hand bowline (useful for anchoring trees, for example), rethreaded bowline (safe for ring-loading, non-capsizing), understanding behaviour of knots under pressure: ring-loading, capsizing, blocking knots, passing knots (to pull knots through rings/biners), etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>Should already know: rappelling, setting and cleaning anchors, using a prussik as third-hand belay in rappel, ascending on a prussik, </p>

<p><em>Personal note</em>:, I can forgive new climbers most things, except for the severe lack of practice in belaying. This is a serious issue, where a lot of self-taught and non-indoor climbing climbers often lack until very far in their climbing careers, due to a reasonable unwillingness to practice on shoddy outdoor anchors and on their own ropes. It's absolutely worthwhile to go to an indoor gym every now and then and spend a few hours practising leading, falling, and catching falls.</p>

"Why does sunscreen not work all day?","8295","","<p>All over the internet it says that sunscreen does not work all day, but does not say anything about why.</p>

<p>Why does sunscreen not work all day?</p>

<p>Does the matrials get destroyed by the UV rays? Or is it because they evaporate?</p>

<p>A product called p20 claims 10 hours but does not provide any evidence, which does not seem trustworthy.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The general principle is to reapply every two to four hours,"" dermatologist James Spencer, MD, of St. Petersburg, Fl, told WebMD. ""Sunscreen does go away with time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://gizmodo.com/how-sunscreen-works-and-why-youre-wrong-about-it-508910004"">http://gizmodo.com/how-sunscreen-works-and-why-youre-wrong-about-it-508910004</a></p>
","<p>All sunscreens are physical barriers, designed to absorb or reflect UV radiation. They rub off over time, and they will rub off faster when exposed to water/moisture, most commonly from sweating or swimming. Friction (e.g. from towel-drying) also removes sunscreen.</p>

<p>Some <a href=""http://www.ewg.org/2014sunscreen/the-trouble-with-sunscreen-chemicals/"">chemical sunscreens do break down when exposed to sunlight</a> and require the addition of other chemicals as stabilizers. This is less of a concern with mineral (zinc or titanium oxide) sunscreens.</p>

<p>The most common recommendation is to reapply sunscreen every 2-3 hours, but this doesn't take into account many variables such as individual sun-sensitivity, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunscreen#Sun_protection_factor_.28SPF.29_and_labeling_requirements"">SPF</a> of the sunscreen, and type/level of activity. So the 2-3 hour guideline is a blanket recommendation that won't necessarily prevent one from burning. In fact, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11712033"">a 2001 study</a> suggests that earlier re-application is more effective:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Advice given to sunscreen users should be to apply sunscreen liberally to exposed sites 15 to 30 minutes before going out into the sun, followed by reapplication of sunscreen to exposed sites 15 to 30 minutes after sun exposure begins. Further reapplication is necessary after vigorous activity that could remove sunscreen, such as swimming, towelling, or excessive sweating and rubbing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for claims of all-day (or x-hour) protection, time estimates are based on a rough calculation using SPF. According to the <a href=""http://www.ewg.org/2014sunscreen/faqs-your-sunscreen-questions-our-answers/"">Environmental Working Group</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SPF is a measurement of sunburn protection, primarily caused by UVB rays. If your skin would normally burn after 10 minutes in the summer midday sun, for example, wearing a thick layer of an SPF 15 sunscreen would theoretically allow you to stay in the sun for 150 minutes (10 x 15) without burning. This is a rough estimate, however, and your own skin, the type of activities you do in the sun (e.g. involving water or sweat) and the intensity of sunlight may affect how much safety it gives you. SPF ratings can be confusing or misleading. The numbers do not reflect the degree of protection from UVA rays, which cause skin aging, immune suppression and cancer. The FDA has warned that high-SPF products can create a false sense of security, contain higher concentrations of allergenic or irritating ingredients and offer little additional sun protection (Branna 2011).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Moreover, manufacturer claims are likely based on a best-case scenario that would involve applying a thick layer ~20 minutes before going outdoors to allow for the lotion to bind to the skin, minimal sweating and friction, and perhaps even use of additional protection measures such as a hat or umbrella.</p>

"What to do at the top of a sport climb","8238","","<p>I dabble a little at leading trad, but have never led a sport route. </p>

<p>If I do a sport lead, I want to make sure I don't make some stupid mistake when I get to the top. For example, I don't want to drop the rope or miscommunicate what I'm doing to my belayer. Suppose I get to the top of a sport route where I'm still on a vertical wall. There is a redundant bolted anchor, and I want to get on that anchor, be lowered, and end up with a top-rope setup. </p>

<p>Can anyone lay out all the typical steps, including knots and verbal signals? </p>

<p>What should have on my belt besides quickdraws? A sling and locking biner? </p>

<p>What etiquette issues are there? </p>

<p>What common problems arise (e.g., not being able to complete the climb), and how do you deal with them?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose I get to the top of a sport route ... and I want to ... end up with a
  top-rope setup.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>""Top-rope setup"" implies that someone else is going to climb the same route after you get down, right?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can anyone lay out all the typical steps...?</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li>Hang a locking karabiner (or a pair of non-locking quickdraws) on the anchor</li>
<li>Clip your rope into it (don't forget to lock the karabiner)</li>
<li>Tell your belayer that you are going to load the rope (we usually shout ""Take!"")</li>
<li>Double-check your setup, then tell your belayer to lower you (we usually shout ""Down!"")</li>
<li>Pick your quickdraws on the way down</li>
</ol>

<p>We sometimes omit step 4 in some very obvious situations (climbing with the same partner for months/years; easy and tedious routes) - I cannot recommend that to anyone, but I admit that we <em>sometimes</em> neglect that extra precaution.</p>

<p>When you are done with the route, and want to retrieve your gear, the last person to climb must clean the route (see Liam's answer).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What should have on my belt besides quickdraws?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you have 2 quickdraws at the end of your climb, it's enough. I usually also have a spare locking karabiner; I use it when quickdraws somehow don't fit (e.g. rubbing against a convoluted wall below the anchor, or karabiner gates catching on some protrusions and coming open).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What etiquette issues are there?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The classical dilemma is about hanging the top-rope on your gear vs hanging it on the fixed anchor:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you hang the top-rope on the fixed anchor, you don't leave any of your gear on the top. This is good because it leaves no room for error, and because whoever climbs with the top-rope doesn't feel obliged to get to the top of the route - one can give up, take the rope and go away.</li>
<li>If you hang the top-rope on your gear, there will be much less friction applied to the fixed anchor, which will let it live longer (I heard it makes a huge difference with popular routes).</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>What common problems arise, and how do you deal with them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If someone is top-roping and cannot get to the top, cleaning the route is problematic. One option is to have the climber pull himself on the rope - I cannot imagine a situation where one would fail to do this using a top-rope - maybe if extremely exhausted, or injured?</p>

<p>A possible problem is when several parties want to climb the same route - either you climb the route another time to retrieve your gear or trust the last climber to clean the route properly (without accidentally falling down), and return your gear to you.</p>

"How to preserve cheese while backpacking?","8233","","<p>Are there specific techniques for carrying/storing cheese while backpacking for a longer time so it doesn´t spoil?</p>

<p>This question is related, but different: <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/q/3398/3143"">Cheese and eggs on backpacking trips</a></p>
","<p>Additional to the two great answers already given I want to share my own experience, repeating some things and adding some:</p>

<h2>Choose your Cheese carefully</h2>

<p>As already mentioned, harder cheese will last longer. Good sorts (I don´t know if available outside Europe): Parmesan, Manchego, ""Bergkäse"".</p>

<p>The cheese will start to mold on the surface. Take this into account, bring large pieces instead of many small (or even slices). Don´t take cheese with holes with you.</p>

<p>As already mentioned by others cheese with a peeling of wax or of other kind will be a better choice since this part of the surface is covered.</p>

<p>I haven´t tried it yet, but I would refrain from bringing mold cheese (like Roquefort)in warm to hot climates/seasons since their taste will get stronger very fast and its hardly to predict how their (non-harming) mold will grow and affect spoiling.</p>

<p>Vegan ""cheese"" may be an alternative for you, since it is less prone to molding, especially if you want cheese stretch for pizza or pasta. However, conventional hard cheese should still be better.</p>

<h2>Keep your cheese cold</h2>

<p>Heat will make your cheese sweat and mold. This makes it easy to carry cheese in winter, but challenging in hot climates. Some tips for keeping it cold:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The refrigerating device suggested by Kate is great. If you don´t have a lake or stream at your disposal, you can try putting it under stones or something alike. Just make sure it doesn´t get eaten by animals - mice and racoon will open most bags, also plastic ones. </p></li>
<li><p>During daytime (in case you are moving), put it at the coldest spot available. Deep in your backpack, it can maintain a cold temperature for quite a long time, especially if you put it near water reserves (e.g. a hydration pack/camelbag). If your paddling, the bottom of your canoe/kayak will be quite cold and a good guess. However, this may conflict with the next point</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Keep your Cheese dry</h2>

<p>Moisture is as bad as heat. While you don´t want to put it in a plastic bag (see also next point), you definitely don´t want it to get wet, as it makes it mold a lot faster. You could put it in a permeable bag and then, together with other stuff (food or clothes, while the latter will probably start to smell) in a bigger, water-proof bag. This will prevent it from sweating as well as from getting wet.</p>

<h2>Put it in a prepared cloth</h2>

<p>I read about this technique for storing it and have tried it out with great success:
Take a clean cloth (e.g. a towel) big enough to wrap your piece of cheese. Soak it in vinegar and let it dry off. If you want to make sure its soaked, you can repeat this. Now (after drying it thoroughfully!) wrap your cheese and carry it always in this towel. It's the best way to store it, the cloth is now kind of antiseptic and will repel mold and is, on the other hand, very permeable.
You still want to make sure it doesn´t get wet.</p>

"How durable is cuben fiber in real, practical use?","8159","","<p>For years I've seen high-tech <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuben_Fiber"" rel=""nofollow"">cuben fiber</a> gear and drooled over how incredibly lightweight it is, and longed to buy or make some of my own equipment with it. (Then upon seeing the price tag, well, my mouth then closes.) It's made of Dyneema so it's theoretically quite a strong fabric for outdoor gear as well. It's become almost a staple material among the super-ultralight gear crowd, but I don't personally know that many people (well, none) who have any equipment utilizing this wonder-material. It's also not common among mainstream manufacturers, being primarily used by cottage gear-makers or DIY outdoors enthusiasts.</p>

<p>What research I've done online is also not very convincing because it is generally based on what the material is <em>supposed</em> to do, and not what it actually does in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p>What I'm interested in knowing is:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>How durable is cuben fiber? How does it stand up to abrasion, punctures, tearing, repeated folding/packing...</p></li>
<li><p>How does it's durability compare to sil-nylon (silicone impregnated nylon) which is quite the mainstream lightweight fabric today. (Also much cheaper.)</p></li>
<li><p>And once it's damaged, how difficult is it to repair? Does it have ""self-healing"" properties like sil-nylon?</p></li>
</ul>
","<p>Cuben fiber is not as durable as some other materials used in the construction of backpacking gear. In backpacking lighter often means less durable which is generally true for cuben fiber as well. A cuben fiber backpack will probably hold for 2000 miles (e.g, a thru-hike) but not much more. For this reason, there is now a hybrid cuben/nylon material which is a bit heavier (2.92 oz/sqyd) and more durable. It can definitely be expensive if you use it everyday for long hikes.</p>

<p>Cuben fiber <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gfcuCh7h04"" rel=""nofollow"">resists puncture and tearing relatively well</a>. Not so much with abrasion and folding. I have a rock sack (for bear bagging) made of cuben and it is heavily beaten up.</p>

<p>Cuben fiber is less durable than sil-nylon in my experience. It also depends on the application (tent, stuff sack, pack, etc.).</p>

<p>Once damaged, it is easy to apply duct tape to it for field repair. You can also use <a href=""http://www.zpacks.com/accessories/tape.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">cuben fiber patches</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>From <a href=""http://www.zpacks.com/FAQs.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">ZPack FAQ</a> backpack section:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Should I go with the normal 1.43 oz/sqyd Cuben Fiber Material or the
  heavier 2.92 oz/sqyd Hybrid material?</strong></p>
  
  <p>I used packs made with the 1.43
  oz/sqyd material on my 2007 Pacific Crest Trail and 2009 Continental
  Divide Trail thru-hikes. In both cases the packs lasted the full 2600+
  mile trips (with some duct tape repairs) but the material was very
  frayed and ready to be replaced by the end.  If you want the lightest
  backpack possible the 1.43 oz/sqyd material is fine, especially for
  shorter trips.</p>
  
  <p>Many people including Joe and Sheryl have completed thru-hikes with
  our newer Hybrid material backpacks. Those packs held up much better
  and were still in good condition at the end. The material only adds a
  couple ounces to the weight of a pack, a small price to pay for the
  added durability on a long trip. <strong>If you are doing a thru-hike, get the
  Hybrid Material</strong>, such as our Arc Blast pack!!</p>

<p>I've always presumed that it is edible but I'm not 100% sure. Can you eat wild garlic? </p>

  herb,[7] boiled as a vegetable,[8] in soup, or as an ingredient for
  pesto in lieu of basil. The stems are preserved by salting and eaten
  as a salad in Russia. A variety of Cornish Yarg cheese has a rind
  coated in wild garlic leaves.[9] The bulbs and flowers are also
  edible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is great, but I'm not sure I trust wikipedia! <strong>Does anyone have any experience of eating/preparing these?</strong></p>
","<p>Here in Slovenia, the use of wild garlic is quite widespread. Although the whole plant, including bulbs, is edible, leaves are most commonly used. </p>

<p>I tried only leaves so far, so I can share my experience with only them.</p>

<h2>Gathering</h2>

<p>Young, light-green leaves are a bit more aromatic, but smaller; older are darker and larger. I pick a mix of both and look for undamaged, clean leaves. (I found very few with a bit chewed out by some animal; sometimes there are some webs on the bottom side, maybe spiders, not sure. It's no problem removing them, but if a leave is already ""settled"" I like to leave it intact.) I pick a leaf with the stem, somewhere at the middle.</p>

<p>Leaves of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lily_of_the_valley"" rel=""noreferrer"">lily-of-the-valley</a> are similar to wild garlic and are poisonous. To confirm that a leaf is wild garlic, I do the following: </p>

<ul>
<li>smell the leaf (must be like garlic),</li>
<li>look at the underside of the leaf (a bit lighter than the top),</li>
<li>each leaf grows from the ground on its own stem, whereas lily-of-the-valley grows several leaves from one stem (seen <a href=""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Convallaria_majalis10.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>),</li>
<li>lily-of-the-valley has pronounced lines on the underside (also seen in the linked image above).</li>
</ul>

<p>A good handful should be enough for one person for a risotto. I put it in a paper bag and it stores well several days in the fridge, but it's best used fresh to keep the most aroma.</p>

<h2>Use</h2>

<p>Wild garlic can be used raw in salads or more commonly to add flavor to soups, risottos, etc. It can be made into a pesto for later use.</p>

<p>Rinse leaves before use. Chop them to your liking and add them towards the end of your dish so it retains more flavor.  You can also sauté it on olive oil or butter beforehand for a minute.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Added two recipes</p>

<h2>Wild garlic risotto</h2>

<p>Boil risotto rice (half to one cup per person) with just enough water that it's mostly gone when the rice is done (commonly around 1 unit rice, 2 units water). Melt butter in a pan and sauté chopped wild garlic (30-40g) and 2-3 cloves garlic for a minute, add cooking cream, season to taste (nutmeg makes a good seasoning here). Pour this into the risotto a few minutes before it's done, mix well, cook until the rice is done.</p>

<h2>Wild garlic pesto</h2>

<p>Chop 250g wild garlic, 10 garlic cloves, 200g sunflower seeds (or pine nuts), mix with olive oil, season with salt and pepper. You can blend it all in a blender for a finer paste. Fill into a jar and top with olive oil.</p>

","<p>Ski wax, like many subtle aspects of sports, is subject to a lot of lore. While there is strong science behind wax, the details of how it affects your daily ski trip is hard to pin down.</p>

<p>That said, there are several situations that cause me to re-wax my skis (and we are talking about PTEX based alpine-style skis here, with a melted-in base wax, rather than hand-applied glide waxes used on cross-country or nordic skis):</p>

<ol>

<li>After 10-20 days of skiing - this is about when I notice that my skis aren't behaving like I want them to. May vary strongly based on your habits and ski locations.</li>
<li>If I scrape it all off skiing over tree branches or rocks (happens a lot).</li>
<li>If the snow conditions change considerably. The main reason would be to change to a ""warm"" wax for better performance on warmer, wetter snow.

<p>For example: I'm having intermittent wrist pain. How can I supportively tape it, yet not restrict it <em>too</em> much, and also not completely cover the palm.</p>

<p>Answers may relate to injury prevention or support, or just general protection of the fingers, hands, or wrist. Please be as descriptive as possible and pictures and/or videos are preferred in any explanations. Personal experience on effectiveness and tips with these tape jobs is also welcome and preferred.</p>
","<p>I am only familiar with a couple but I wouldn't be surprised if there are many more for certain injuries or specific applications (e.g. ankle taping for off-widths).</p>

<h2>Crack climbing</h2>

<p>For crack climbing ""tape gloves"" are very helpful in keeping the thin skin on the backs of your hands and knuckles from getting torn up.  There are several slightly different methods and a search should bring up plenty of results, but here are a couple:</p>

<h2>Finger ""pulley"" protection</h2>

<p>Many people tape fingers with the idea of protecting the ligament ""pulleys"" of the finger flexor tendons, usually following an injury.  I have read in several sources that this is ineffective, at least so far as in actually supporting the ligament, because it would have to be damagingly tight to work as people suppose it does.  This page, also from Chockstone.org, suggests that it may serve to limit (bad) motion or simply remind that an injury exists:</p>

"What is a freestanding tent and why should I want one?","8072","","<p>What is a free-standing tent? What are the advantages of a free-standing tent as opposed to a tent that isn't, and what are the disadvantages?</p>

<p>See also:
<a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/q/3130/566"">What is a self erecting tent and why should I want one?</a></p>
","<p>A free standing tent can be put up in a location that won't let you put pegs into the ground, such as on a rocky surface, because it establishes structure of its own and the pegs are just to keep it from blowing away. You can tie the tent to rocks or trees if pegs won't go into the ground. In a pinch, you can use rocks inside the tent to keep it down, or rely on your own weight.</p>

<p>There are other benefits too. In 30 years of camping I've set up on solid rock maybe twice. But I can't count the number of times I've unpegged the wet tent, carried it somewhere sunnier than where I pitched it, and even rolled it on one side to expose the wet base to a breeze. I've also unpegged a tent that still had bedding in it, put it in a canoe, and moved it to another (very nearby) site and then pegged it back out again.</p>

<p>If you plan to camp with small children, then you should enjoy being able to set up the tent in the least tent-peg-friendly location of all (and one where both rocks and trees are in remarkably short supply): your living room. Great place to practice setup and for the kids to practice sleeping in it.</p>

"Can/Should I cook in my tent?","7996","","<p>When camping in bad weather I'm always asking myself if it is a good idea to cook in my tent with a gas cooker. Obviously there is the danger of fire. But how dangerous is this really? Can you easily burn down the tent? And are there any other dangers? Maybe carbon monoxide poising?</p>
","<p>Absolutely not! Fire is the obvious risk, but carbon monoxide poisoning should be taken seriously as well. If the weather is bad, at the very least cook under the vestibule with maximum ventilation.</p>

"Raw meat on hikes","7972","","<p>When backpacking we often carry raw beef which we have salted and frozen, usually cut into strips that can be easily cooked through.  I'm confident that this is good for 24 hours, and I know that meat actually keeps for a lot longer than we think after growing up with refrigeration. </p>

<p>How long is it safe to keep raw meat on a hike?  (assume temperate conditions, not jungle, not dessert).</p>
","<p>It would say it varies to a high degree since the source of the meat and the cut of the meat will be the primary factors in determining how many bacteria (and which type) will be on the surface of the meat. I wouldn't want to trust hamburger or mass market ground meat for even a few hours not refrigerated - so any meats that are mechanically tenderized or ground would be off my packing list. Assuming a solid cut of meat, you have to now think about surface bacteria primarily and rancidity / decomposition of the entire cut of meat secondarily.</p>

<hr>

<p>Practically, a nice cut of meat from my local butcher might be something I'd keep for three days or longer with temperatures in the 40 F (4.4 C)range. The <a href=""http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Factsheets/Refrigeration_&amp;_Food_Safety/index.asp"" rel=""noreferrer"">USDA standards for refrigeration</a> and <a href=""http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Factsheets/Meat_Preparation_Fact_Sheets/index.asp"" rel=""noreferrer"">meat preparation</a> are good ones to know for both cooking (assuming your meat is contaminated and you need to kill harmful bacteria) and storage. There is a margin of safety on the USDA guidelines, but at least you'll know what risks you are taking when you exceed them.</p>

<p>I would feel much more comfortable if I was bringing solid cuts of meat from a butcher that I know has whole animals or high quality sources. Your butcher will be invaluable for advice as well on how long certain cuts of raw meat will age. He or she can steer you towards the best cuts when you let them know your plans.</p>

<p>I would be inclined to salt or seal the exposed portions of a large cut of meat and slice off portions as you eat along the journey. Proper cooking will be even more important since bacteria will have much more time to grow if you cannot maintain the meat in the temperature range where bacteria are dormant. With all the sous vide methods for cooking meat inside a sealed package, it seems like you are taking a lot of risk for no real payback in terms of quality of the campsite meal by packing raw meat.</p>

"What do the climbing terms ""Redpoint"", ""Pinkpoint"", ""Flash"" and ""Onsight"" mean?","7872","","<p>In climbing what do the terms <strong>Redpoint</strong>, <strong>Pinkpoint</strong>, <strong>Flash</strong> and <strong>Onsight</strong> mean? </p>

<p>Where does it come from?</p>
","<p>The two terms specifically refer to the finer aesthetics of <strong>Lead Climbing</strong>, in which a climber will either create intermediate anchors using gear (referred to as traditional climbing), or will use the bolted anchors on a wall (referred to as sport climbing), and clip the rope to them as he/she ascends for protection.</p>

<p>To understand the two terms, you will need to understand some other terms first: <em>Onsight</em>, and <em>Flash</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Flash</strong>: If you were to climb a route using either of these two methods, and made it to the top of the route both without falling, and without resting your weight on the belay chain, you have successfully flashed the route, congratulations!</li>
<li><strong>Onsight</strong>: If you did all the above without getting any <strong>Beta</strong>, then you have successfully on-sighted the route, you get a double congratulations! (<em>Beta is defined as any information pertaining to the climb, like where the hardest moves are or the best ways to get through or avoid them</em>).</li>
</ul>

<p>If you fall or rest on the rope (held by your belayer) during your first attempt to flash or on-sight a route, but know that you could have done better, you may decide to try again after coming down.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Pinkpoint</strong>: A successful second, third, or twentieth attempt to climb the route from start to finish, without either falling or resting on the rope, will net you the pinkpoint, hi-five!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Redpoint</strong>: Lastly, the redpoint, which is only slightly different to the pinkpoint, refers to climbing the route in exactly the same way, but while having to place the gear to protected the route as you ascend. If you managed to do this, you have redpointed the route, double hi-five!</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The difference between redpoint and pinkpoint can seem subtle, so here is a picture from Alli Rainey's site to better explain. The route he is climbing on the left side already has some quick-draws in place to clip to, the route to his right however, does not. A climber going up the right side of the picture would have to take quick-draws with to attach to these hangers.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/COClk.jpg"" alt=""Alli Rainey Climbing in Scotland""></p>

<p>The term redpoint originates from German climber Kurt Albert in the 70's. He painted a red-circle at the base of a climb which he later filled in once successfully free-climbing the entire route.</p>

<p>Matt Dickinson (the other side of Everest) eats <strong>Muesli</strong> and <strong>pistachio nuts</strong>. </p>

<p>Lou Kasischke (After the wind) was very fond of <strong>M&amp;Ms</strong> (and write a few time his despise for oatmeal)</p>

<p>Jon Krakauer (Into thin air) eats also <strong>M&amp;Ms</strong> and <strong>some candy bars</strong>.</p>

<p>Graham Ratcliffe (A day to die for) seems to enjoy a few <strong>Mars</strong> bars.</p>

<p>Ed Viesturs (No shortcuts to the top) advises to eat a few candy bars, like <strong>Twix</strong> and <strong>Snickers</strong>. He also mentions <strong>energy gels</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On the summit day, it's important to go as light as possible. Lunch, which you eat almost anytime during the day, can be as little as a candy bar or two - Snickers, Twix, and hard semisweet chocolate bars are my favorites.

"How to attach signs to trees considering tree growth?","7814","","<p>I am trying to determine the best way to attach trail signs to trees in the woods.</p>

<p>The problem with trees is that they grow.  If you firmly embed a nail in the wood, the tree will eventually grow around the nail head.  When we put up small plastic trail markers (what we use a blazes), we deliberately leave a &frac12; inch or so gap between the nail head and the marker.  Put another way, we don't bang the nail in all the way.  This gives the marker room to slide along the nail, instead of the growing tree pushing all around behind the nail head, and eventually buckling and cracking the plastic marker.</p>

<p>I am now going to put up some aluminum signs that will last much longer than the plastic trail markers.  A tree could grow multiple inches over the expected life of the sign.  What I'd like is a way to mount the sign so that it stays on the outside, moving with the growth of the tree instead of getting swallowed up by it.</p>

<p>It seems that just the right diameter and length of nail might do it.  You want the sign to be held, but the nail be able so slide out as the tree grows and pushes against the sign.  What diameter and depth might that be? What studies are there that have looked into this? What experience do you have with this?</p>
","<p>Given that trees don't push outward, one option is to use lag bolts, and once a year two go around and turn them out a little bit so they are never engulfed in the growth.</p>

<p>The amount of turning you'll need to do and the frequency will depend on the speed of growth and how secure you need the sign.  If you can leave a half-inch out of the tree and have the sign hang on it, as you are currently doing with nails, and if they are slow growing trees, you may only need to turn them every few years.  Fast trees with no bolt head gap may need to be loosened twice a year or more.</p>

<p>While the signs are light a thicker lag bolt than necessary should be considered so you can exert the force required to loosen it after the tree re-seals the damage caused by it and makes it much harder to turn initially.</p>

<p>There are a lot of resources about <a href=""http://www.thetreehouseguide.com/constructiontutorials/fixturesandfastenings.htm"">fixing items to trees</a> in the tree house communities and businesses on the internet.  There you can find out more about <a href=""http://treehouses.com/joomla/index.php/construction/garnier-limb"">how trees grow with items attached</a>.  There are situations where <a href=""http://www.treetopbuilders.net/fasteners/"">a tree will exert apparent pressure</a> on items affixed to the outside, but the issue is that the pressure isn't great enough to overcome the friction of the fastener into the heartwood. Most accounts suggest that if small nails are used on large flat boards, some trees will push the board away, pulling the fasteners through.  Otherwise the board is engulfed as well, becoming part of the tree (and a vector for disease and damage)</p>

<p>Treehouses are usually built using lag bolts with several inches of space between the tree and the board attached to the lag bolt.  Once the tree grows to the board, the tree house must be adjusted to move the board away from the tree again, and the lag bolt loosened or re-positioned depending on the tree house redesign.</p>

<p>Stainless steel or hot dipped galvanized bolts are needed for long term tree attachment use.</p>

"How should a climbing rope be stored?","7741","","<p>I've purchased my first climbing rope and am wondering how it should be stored when not in use.  I have a rope bag which I assume is a good home for the rope; should it be kept tightly coiled inside the bag; loosely flaked, or stored entirely differently?</p>
","<p>In a bag at the back of your closet will be fine. Your rope is made of nylon, which does not like the following:</p>

<li>halogens (chlorine, flourine etc. and their compounds)</li>
<li>bleaches and strong soaps</li>

<li>dirt (sand is especially bad)</li>
<li>cats</li>
<li>rodents</li>
<li>sharp things</li>

<ul>
<li>gasoline</li>
<li>common oils</li>
<li>other stable plastic-like products</li>
<li>water (see note about salt water)</li>
<li>sub-zero temperatures</li>
<li>mold, mildew, other organic products. They may live <em>with</em> the nylon, but cannot live <em>off</em> the nylon.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nylon is perfectly happy in a clean, dry, dark place.</p>

<p>Salt water doesn't damage nylon. Salt inside your rope (after the water dries) is millions of tiny knives going to work on the fibers with every movement. If you are near the ocean and it gets wet, keep it wet. Seriously - put it in a cooler and add more ocean water. When you get home, rinse repeatedly in fresh water including an overnight soak. If the rinse water still tastes salty, do it again.</p>

<p>Sub-zero, dry nylon is fine. Frozen, wet nylon tends to break. Frozen, wet ropes that are warmed up and dried out will be fine.</p>

"Is bear spray effective against other animals?","7731","","<p>Is bear spray (pepper spray specially formulated to be effective against bear attacks) effective against other animals, especially mountain lions or wolves? Or is there something in it specifically targeted towards bears that would make it less effective on other attacking animals?</p>
","<p>Given that the active ingredient is capsaicin which is used in self-defence sprays for all types of purposes, bear spray should be effective on anything with tear ducts, soft tissue, sinuses, eyeballs, etc, (and will totally dominate a bean burrito**).</p>

<p>The discriminating difference between ""bear spray"" vs ""self-defense"" spray, vs. law enforcement ""occupy-protester"" spray is a combination of volume, range, spray pattern, and percent capsaicin and oleoresin capsicum (capsaicin is what gives the spray the ""heat"" ranging in the 1-3% range, while oleoresin capsicum is pepper oil extract that contains the capsaicin).</p>

<p>Other than that, it is all essentially the same stuff, and has been used effectively against bear, moose, dogs, cats, and people.</p>

<p>However, as pointed out in other answers, each animal's behavior / attack pattern varies, meaning your ability to implement pepper spray in a timely effective manner may be limited. Knowing what threats are in the area you are traveling, and the best way to prevent an encounter in the first place is your BEST plan. </p>

<p>**NOTE: although capsaicin IS the same thing that gives chillies their heat, (and in fact is isolated from chillies) DO NOT use bear spray or other self defense sprays as a flavor enhancer. I point it out as a segue to illustrate that Pepper spray is only effective as an active counter-attack measure sprayed directly in the face of an assailant, and should NOT be used as a ""repellent."" There have been reports of people spraying bear-spray on their tents and sleeping bags like mosquito repellent which is basically the same as turning yourself into bear-sized buffalo wings.</p>

<p>I'm no outdoor expert, but is it generally advised that people take both types of glasses? I won't be doing any mountaineering or ice climbing, but at what point do sunglasses become insufficient in protecting my eyes? </p>
","<p>When I first planned my trek in Himalays I was suggested to keep my Gogs and Glares with me when I am outdoor-bound, in snow.<br>
A good article in my Adventure related Database rtf files says: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hours of bright sunlight can burn the surface of the eye, causing a temporary but painful condition known as Photokeratitis. Over time, unprotected exposure can contribute to Cataracts, as well as cancer of the eyelids and the skin around the eyes.</p>
  
  <p>UV exposure also may increase the risk of macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness in people over age 65. While cataracts can be removed surgically, there is no way to reverse damage to the macula, the area in the center of the retina.
  To protect your eyes, it is important to wear sunglasses that block out harmful UV light.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A coating of snow reflects nearly 80% of the sun's rays. This means that your eyes are subjected to 80% more light on a clear day when the ground is covered with snow than when you are on a grassland.</p>

<p>One more tip for ya fellow: I guess, You know that Retina is that magical thing which makes you see things by simply converting light into electrical signals and send it to brain. To make you see something, most of the light is incident on the center of the Retina. And, the retina is more sensitive to Blue and Yellow light. Thats why I chose to have a Blue tinted Snow Gog. So, one such glass will help your eyes filtering out most of the light that is not blue or yellow and will make it easier to see objects directly ahead.</p>

"What is a typical elongation of a dynamic climbing rope?","7678","","<p>I'm looking into buying a rope for rock climbing, and I know that I need a dynamic rope for lead climbing. However, trying to find information on the elongation percentages of ropes is proving tricky.</p>

<p>Some sources say that an elongation of 6.5% is typical for a dynamic rope, but  others put this number at around 30% (with a maximum allowed of 40%). The rope I'm looking at is a 6.5% elongation, and the salesman says it's dynamic. However, some websites reference static ropes at ""under 10% elongation"" while others say ""1-5%"".</p>

<p>Can someone help clarify?</p>
","<p>You are apparently confusing static and dynamic elongation.  You must use rope that is UIAA-101 / EN-892 certified for the task at hand.  You will be buying a Single type rope unless you specifically know otherwise.</p>

<p>Quoting <a href=""http://bealplanet.com/sport/anglais/savoir.php"">Beal Ropes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Dynamic elongation</strong>:<br>
  This is the stretch of the rope during the first UIAA test fall. It must be less than 40%.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Static elongation</strong>:<br>
  Measured under a load of 80kg it must not exceed 10% for single rope, 12% for double rope, and 10% for two
  strands of twin rope together.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you see the static elongation <em>must be</em> no more than 10% for a Single climbing rope, yet to meet the impact force requirements the dynamic elongation is going to have to be much higher than that (though it may not exceed 40%).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Impact force</strong></p>
  
  <p>Values required by the Standard:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Single rope: Impact force lower than 12kN holding the first factor 1.77 fall with a mass of 80kg.</li>
  <li>Double rope: Impact force lower than 8kn holding the first factor 1.77 fall with a mass of 55kg.</li>
  <li>Twin rope: Impact force lower than 12kN holding the first factor 1.77 fall with a mass of 80kg, on two strands.</li>

  <p>The impact force printed in the technical notice must not be lower

"Should a carabiner ever be clipped to the tie-in loops and should anything other than a carabiner ever attach to the belay loop?","7670","","<p>I'm a beginning climber and am trying to resolve conflicting instruction related to tying into  my harness.</p>

<p>During a recent outing a friend (an experienced climber, but not an instructor) was showing me the basics of switching from climbing to rappelling.  The basic steps followed were:</p>

<ol>
<li>Climbing to the anchor while on belay, tied in directly to the
rope</li>
<li>Securing a sling to my belay loop by threading it through itself,
then securing it to the anchor via a locking biner (<strong>first
question</strong>)</li>
<li>Securing the rope to myself, then untying from it</li>
<li>Halving the rope, attaching my rappel device, and using a locking
carabiner to secure the device to the tie-in loops (<strong>second
question</strong>)</li>
<li>...the rest isn't really relevant</li>
</ol>

<p>So my questions arise from the usage of the belay and tie-in loops.  I've been taught by a trained instructor that rope should never be tied directly into the belay loop as it can generate excessive friction and cause failure.</p>

<p>My first question relates to my friend's instruction to secure the sling to my belay loop without a carabiner.  This made me wonder if we were misusing the belay loop.  Her rationale was that the tie-ins were occupied by the rope, and since the sling would be used to hold my static weight (and not a fall) that there was no risk of excessive friction.</p>

<p>My second question comes from attaching my rappel device.  I was instructed to clip it through both tie-in loops rather than the belay device.  Again her rationalization was that the belay loop was occupied by the sling.</p>

<p>And a final question related to the first two: most of the reasoning for this approach was to keep the tie-ins and belay loop occupied by a single sling / biner / rope at any time.  Is it unsafe to have multiple connections to a single point while switching from climbing to rappelling (e.g. a rope and sling through the tie-ins, or two biners through the belay loop if I'm clipped to both a rope and a sling)?</p>
","<p>Question: <strong>Should I girth hitch my main belay loop</strong></p>

<p>Answer: <strong><em>No!  You shouldn't girth-hitch a sling to your belay loop.  The belay loop should only ever be in contact with a carabiner, as the trained instructor told you.</em></strong>  As the instructor told you, girth hitching to the main belay loop will cause it extra wear, and make it wear out faster.</p>

<p>You <em>can</em> girth hitch slings through the two ""tie-in"" points that the belay loop itself runs through - on most harnesses those tie-in points are designed for that - they're extra thick, have a protective nylon layer, and since they're two of them, they're redundant.  But...</p>

<p>If you're asking about the ""easiest"" system to use, I'd recommend getting an ""anchor chain"".  There are a few different ones on the market (see <a href=""http://www.outdoorgearlab.com/Anchor-Chain-Reviews/buying-advice"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">link</a>).  They are specalized slings that solve this problem you're facing, and many people find them more convenient than using slings.  Also, because they're a commercial product, they come with instructions.  :)</p>

<p><strong>Question:  Should I run a carabiner through both my tie-in points, or the main belay loop</strong></p>

<p>Answer:  DO NOT clip a carabiner through the two tie in points.  This will ""cross-load"" the carabiner.  Also, it will put the rappel device awkwardly close to your person and clothes.  Instead clip it into the belay loop.  That's what a belay loop is for.</p>

<p>See <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/1384/what-does-it-mean-to-cross-load-a-carabiner"">this question</a> for images on how to tie in and a brief explanation of the reasoning behind.</p>

<li>bring a small hand whisk to keep the tent swept out and use it at every takedown, plus daily if you stay in one spot</li>
<li>if your knees or backside are sandy, get them brushed off before you get in the tent. Use your dry hands, or the tent whisk, to get the worst off while you're still outside - ideally, step a few feet away from the tent while you do so</li>
<li>buy replacement sliders for your tent zippers and keep them permanently in a tent pocket or your repair kit. Sand abrades the inside of zipper sliders and keeps the zipper from closing. Replacing them is a matter of minutes and presto - your zipper closes again</li>
<li>hang things up even if they aren't wet, to keep them out of the sand or to give sand a chance to fall / blow out of them. To that end, get several clotheslines up pretty much as soon as you've set up camp, and always bring a dozen clothespegs with you (I keep mine in the rope bag)</li>
<li>work out a way to get from your sand-rinsing place to the tent without picking up more sand. This may mean taking a towel to the rinsing place and coming back dry, or it may mean setting the rinse station up somewhere that has a no-sand path back to the tent area. Or you might go the baby powder way and keep water out of the desanding process.</li>
</ul>

<p>I can generally avoid sand even on a beach site, and just keep a towel at the border of sand and vegetation, but a forest site can have a lot of ""bittiness"" - shreds of tree material I guess - that most of this also applies to.</p>

"How do you go upriver in a canoe?","7583","","<p>Let's say you want to be a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyageurs"">voyageur</a>, canoeing on a river like the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Saskatchewan_River"">North Saskatchewan</a>.  (We'll leave aside the current state of the beaver pelt industry.)</p>

<p>What do you have to do differently to travel upriver, rather than down?  Is there any particular equipment that's more useful when traveling upriver?  Are there any river/weather conditions that would make the journey easier?</p>
","<p>Upstreampaddling can be very exhausting, but in genereal it's more predictable than paddling downstream. I got my knowledge purely out of experience and not out of books, i paddled down the whole Rhine and in the process of it i had to change direction a few times, so i'll try to provide you with a rundown of the essential learnings.</p>

<p>A River just flows downstream if you've never been on a river, if you've ever been on water (this includes the bathtub) the first thing you'll notice is that water is a very dynamic Element, the current of the water is dependent on multiple factors.</p>

<ol>
<li>How wide is the river</li>
<li>How deep is the river</li>
<li>How fast is the river</li>
<li>Is the riverbed flat (like in canals) or is it a natural riverbed with inconsistencies like large rocks etc.</li>
<li>Weather conditions (e.g. wind)</li>
</ol>

<p>All of this factors play a major role on a river, especially everything that happens above the water (weather) because you'll most likely got the biggest surface above the water. Below i tried to scribble my thoughts, as you see there are different signs from which you can read the river, see list below with explanations.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/A6MmO.png"" alt=""Current by Riverbed""></p>

<ol>
<li>Riverbed gets deeper - this will slow down the river, since the same amount of water has more space to flow.</li>
<li>Riverbed gets shallow - this will speed up the river, because there's less space for the same amount of water to flow, you can identify those spots by the ""mushrooms"" the water will build here.</li>
<li>If the riverbed falls back down again like in my scribble watch out because there might be a whirl under the surface which will feel like something is sucking your paddle down.</li>
<li>Flat riverbed - not much surprises here, those are the parts where you can eat your lunch etc.</li>
<li>Large Stones etc. in riverbed/uneven - You'll be able to identfy those spots by the waves building there, depending on the speed of the river this will result in whitewater, avoid this parts with your Canoe, speed of river will change between superfast and reverese.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now more details for your question ""how to travel upstream""</p>

<p>At the outer side of curves you'll have the current with you, this is very counterintuitive, as you see you'll have to change the side of the river from time to time, more about this topic later on. Always keep in mind that sharp stones under the surface are most likely to be at the side of the river, depending on the waterlevel this leads to capsizing or a broken boat.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YKBSk.png"" alt=""Currents in a river, and how to paddle upstream""></p>

<p>To change Sides of the river, you'll need to do some ferrying (see scribble below) this is probably one of the most hectic things you have to do. Because you don't want to lose distance here, and if not everybody works together you'll end up needing to cross the river again because you traveled back and need to get to the outer side again.
If you travel downstream it's very counterintuitive since you have to paddle backwards to ferry across a river.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yykzD.png"" alt=""Ferry movement""></p>

<p>In general going upstream is not much of a problem, if you know how to read the water.
Just as a reminder, make sure to wear safetyequipment (livevests, and tethers) so you minimize the risk of drowning. Rivers no matter how they look have the risk of strong underwater currents which are not always possible to read, those currents really drag you down with no chance of ever catching a bit air again, always keep this in mind and you'll be save.</p>

"What type of rope should I use for roof work?","7561","","<p>Am going to do some repairs on my roof, (not a climber).
not sure regarding the type of rope I should get?</p>

<p>Also, any advice as to how to secure the rope to my harness?</p>
","<p>If you're not a climber, then don't buy a climbing rope for doing roof repairs. If you're going to buy a rope for a very specific job, then you should get the right equipment for the job. </p>

<p><em>For about the same cost as a climbing rope</em> you could get a full <strong><a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000JFK77C"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">roofers kit</a></strong> that comes with a:</p>

<ul>
<li>5 point safety harness</li>
<li>50ft lifeline</li>
<li>anchor plate </li>
<li>3' shock absorbing lanyard:</li>
</ul>

<p>A couple reasons why you <strong>shouldn't</strong> use climbing gear for roof repairs: 
If you slip, you are most likely going to end up <em>upside down</em> as soon as you slide off the roof if you're wearing a climbing harness instead of a body harness; You put your expensive climbing rope at risk of damage that will make it <em>useless</em> for climbing (nails, saws, getting stepped on, sharp edges, etc.) You risk overloading the rope with more shock when you take a fall on a short length, the dynamic qualities of a rope are most effective if you have a good length of rope to absorb the shock. </p>

<p>Unless your plan is to use repairing your roof as an excuse to invest in some climbing gear so you can get into climbing after, then I would recommend buying a roofers kit, and asking your roofing questions on <a href=""https://diy.stackexchange.com/"">this SE site</a>.  </p>

<p>If you <em>are</em> using the roof as an excuse to buy climbing gear (I come up with any excuse I can), then what you want to do is get a good <strong><a href=""http://www.mec.ca/AST/ContentPrimary/Learn/Climbing/RopesAndWebbing/ChoosingRopes.jsp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">single</a> rope that's >10mm</strong> of whatever length you want, a <strong><a href=""http://www.mec.ca/product/5031-582/edelrid-chest-harness-unisex/?q=chest%2Bharness"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">chest harness</a></strong>, a <strong><a href=""http://www.mec.ca/product/5035-386/metolius-alpine-pas/?q=personal%2Banchor"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">personal anchor</a></strong> (<a href=""http://www.mec.ca/product/5035-281/petzl-scorpio-vertigo/?q=feratta"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">lanyard</a>/<a href=""http://www.mec.ca/product/5016-280/black-diamond-18mm-nylon-slings/?f=10%2050001%2050282"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sling</a>) and a <strong><a href=""http://www.mec.ca/product/5031-657/petzl-basic-ascender/?q=ascender"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mechanical ascender</a></strong>. Anchor one end of the rope to the ground on the opposite side of the house you're working on, either to a tree or your truck or something that's a lot heavier than you, then simply throw the rope all the way over the top of the house. <strong>Don't tie into the rope</strong>, instead put the ascender on the rope and tie into your harness with your personal anchor, then run it through a biner on your chest harness and clip it into the ascender. Voila, you've just rigged your own roofers kit out of climbing gear.</p>

"How can I tell if Chinese rock climbing gear is reliable?","7473","","<p>Most (if not all) the big rock climbing brands do manufacture their gear in China - carabiners, cams, slings, whatever.</p>

<p>Now, I stumbled on this:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.aliexpress.com/store/group/Climbings/1453743_258307418.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.aliexpress.com/store/group/Climbings/1453743_258307418.html</a></p>

<p>It looks like well made gear and the price is interesting. 
The brand isn't well known though. I am very curious about Chinese brands and I feel like those devices may rival the most famous ones. But, I don't know for sure. Considering that most if not all production is made there, the Chinese must have the skill and the know-how.</p>

<p>How can I judge whether these products are reliable?</p>

<p>Thanks so much.</p>
","<p>While I'm not too familiar with this brand, a 2013 article on BackpackingLight (largely paywalled) discussed <a href=""http://www.backpackinglight.com/cgi-bin/backpackinglight/2013_developments_canister_stoves.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">recent developments in canister stoves</a>, most of which are now manufactured in Asia.  I think some of the comments from that article, and a <a href=""http://www.backpackinglight.com/cgi-bin/backpackinglight/made_in_china.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">preceeding 2009 article</a> discussing Chinese manufacturing of outdoor gear, may apply here as well.</p>

<p>Manufacturing quality can range from very high to quite low.  (Most high-quality Western brands are also coming out of Chinese factories now.)  An OEM factory doing a ""few extra runs"" in the evening, or making cosmetic tweaks will likely produce goods that are still of decent quality.  A factory that hasn't had direct contact with Western designers and is simply creating products that <em>look</em> similar is much more likely to have quality issues.</p>

<p>One problem identified in the 2009 article was that the manufacturers may not be familiar with the design history, and thus not understand why certain decisions were made.  (They also may not be familiar with the actual end use of the product.)  This can result in cost-cutting decisions that also impact safety or performance, particularly with manufacturers that don't have in-house engineering talent.</p>

<p>The 2013 article has a more optimistic view, noting some of the in-house Asian stoves makers are showing ""serious design and development work"".  An example of this would be with the Chinese stove-manufacturer Fire Maple, which appears to have added skilled engineering talent to their company and is doing its own development.</p>

<p>Returning to the ""GoodMakings"" company and their climbing hardware, I would be curious as to whether this company is an OEM for more well-known brands, as that suggests a better chance of manufacturing quality.  (Someone with access to the appropriate testing equipment could likely order some of their items and run a few tests.)</p>

<p>Now for the questionable bit.  I see their helmet displays the <a href=""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:UIAA_Safety_Label_logo_color.svg"" rel=""noreferrer"">UIAA Safety Label</a> (the image on the back of the helmet), but am not able to find mention of this brand in the <a href=""http://www.theuiaa.org/risk-management.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">UIAA's database</a>.  This is worrisome, and suggests a possibility that the certificate markings may be ""purely decorative"".</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> It appears the company is now a UIAA safety label holder, and has at least received certifications for some of its hardware.  Based on descriptions of GM products listed on <a href=""http://storrick.cnc.net/VerticalDevicesPage/VerticalHome.shtml"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://storrick.cnc.net/VerticalDevicesPage/VerticalHome.shtml</a> GM may be an OEM for smaller western companies, now expanding under its own name.</p>

"How to help birds with water?","7466","","<p>In India, the monsoon lasts for 4 months between June and September. Since last week or so the rain is gone, and this monsoon hasn't been decent, the rainfall had been it's lowest since the 1970's and we are already facing a water-scarcity. The temperature has already reached 38 <sup>o</sup>C.   </p>

","<p>Providing water for birds in summer is always a brilliant idea, not just to drink but for them to have a nice bath in!</p>

<p>Usually bird baths are actually kind of shallow, or rather the edges usually are dipping gently into a deeper pool in the middle. This kind of dish on a balcony would suffice. </p>

<p>Our multipurpose bird feeder came with a rather small waterbowl. About 8 inches diameter and 1 inch deep, this does suffice as well and I have seen birds drink from it but never bathe. I think this is due to the fact it's got vertical edges.</p>

<p>There is a slight issue with leaving water out in so far as the hotter it gets the faster it will evaporate and therefore in a sense it will be a waste (taking into account a water shortage). </p>

<p>You can also get <a href=""http://www.selections.com/gardman-wild-bird-hanging-fresh-water-drinker.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">water drinkers</a> though. These act exactly like a chickens water bowl, and should still suit most birds. </p>

I have carried mine up in a small pack, but I end up taking hardly any pictures, since it is so cumbersome to get to it. What do professional climbing photographers/videographers do?</p>
","<p>I wish I was still in Yosemite for this one. I used to climb with some fairly well known climbers back in the day, ""Big Wall Pete"" Takeda, the Parker Brothers, even happened on Peter Croft after he taught a class and we climbed for about 45 minutes. Big Wall used to work for ""Climbing"" and did a number of photo shoots, I know how they get the pictures from above and away from the rock using bivouac style set ups, but I never asked about taking the big cameras up. We used to take cheaper cameras up. We would tape a loop on them, throw a biner on it and drag it up that way. Almost always wrapped in a protective padded bag attached separately. If you drag it behind you and in its own case, it is easier to get to than say in the center of your food bag. Just remember that the camera is never to come un-clipped. You could rig up something with a 6' sling attached to the back of your harness and then a second carabiner closer to the camera and clip it to say your hip, with a camera bag for protection. This will give you quicker access, if that is an issue, but at the cost of being in the way.</p>

<p>The biggest reason why we stopped taking cameras up had more to do with the relatively lame angles you get from taking it from another climber's perspective. Either you get their feet or the top of their head. To get better shots, you need a separate team climbing ahead with bivouac gear to push you away from the rock, this will give you a lot better angle to shoot from. And if you are going to be taking a DSLR, I am guessing you are a lot more serious about the shots, so you might want to look into getting that set up figured out. For quicker and easier shots, you can lock off and stand horizontal off the rock. This is easier, and more of an angle than just hanging, but might not bring justice to taking a DSLR up the rock.</p>

"Is ankle support a myth?","7390","","<p>There seems to be an <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uywIYQEHZLs"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ongoing holy war with ""boots people"" vs ""shoes people""</a>. A comment on <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/13907/should-i-give-up-on-my-new-hiking-boots"">this question</a> caught my eye:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...Ankle support is a myth for most folks....</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now I've always worn boots and I beleieve that ankle support helps a lot, especially when I'm tired. When I do wear shoes (approch shoes etc) I get sore ankles. So for me boots work. But I've seen many opinions stating the opposite.</p>

<p>Opinons aren't much use though... </p>

<p>Has there been any studies on this? what were the results? </p>

<hr>

<h2>Parameters of the question</h2>

<p>I'm only really interested in the use of boots in a <strong>hiking</strong> setting. Not climbing, technical terrain, etc. So imagine walking a moderate mountain trail with a moderate pack in summer. Which would be best.</p>

<p><strong>I don't want this to turn into a <em>I prefer</em> question. So please do not state your personal opinion in an answer. I really only want quotes from good studies on the subject</strong></p>
","<p>Since you asked for actual studies, I think a study on general ankle support in sports will be helpful (It focuses on basketball and volleyball, but has also some generic information that might be useful): <a href=""http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/31/2/102.full.pdf+html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Here</a> is a study on ankle support in general. </p>

<p>One should note that hiking does not seem to be affected by that much ankle injuries in general, as mentioned after the abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[...] Some sports like basketball and volleyball
  have high ground reaction forces when players
  land from a high jump, which accentuates the
  sprain and the rate of injury. This accounts for
  these sports having 79% and 87% of inversion
  sprains respectively and 2.5 times more ankle
  injuries than walking or hiking. [...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On injury prevention:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[...] As has already been mentioned, although some
  limitation of ankle range of movement can be
  achieved with taping and bracing, it is doubtful
  whether tapes and braces will withstand the
  forces of an inversion sprain [...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the summary:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[...] that both mechanical
  and functional stability of the ankle
  can be improved with taping [...]</p>
  
  <p>[...] Both taping
  and braces have been shown to prevent
  ankle sprains in basketball and soccer players, [...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the key points:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Restrict range of movement</li>
  <li>Reduce reinjury rate</li>
  <li>Improve proprioception</li>
  <li>Limitation of movement is lost after exercise</li>
  <li>No negative effect on most performance tests</li>
  <li>Little negative effect on other joints</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Summa sumarum, what I gained from reading this paper:</p>

<p>Ankle support does indeed help - so I guess high boots will indeed help too. But: If you have healthy ankles the differences might not be significant. 
When the ankles are already instable support seems to be desirable.</p>

<p>I recommend reading over the paper on your own to gain a better picture.</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT:
<strong>* Disclamer: This patent does not link to any research that confirms the following statements, take them with a grain of salt.*</strong></p>

<p>In further research I stumbled upon the <a href=""https://www.google.com/patents/US4213255"" rel=""noreferrer"">following patent</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[...] The sole is so configured that the boot can be defined to hold the wearer's ankle substantially more firmly than has heretofore been possible. The sole is so shaped that the sole configuration itself effectively performs the rolling action, both on initial contact and on take-off from a step or stride, which would otherwise require flexing of the ankle and foot muscles during normal walking. Thus, the present sole makes it possible to construct a hiking boot which has substantially improved performance in terms of protecting the wearer from fatigue and injury while walking long distances over various terrains. [...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The text above basically states that with this sole less ankle movement is required, therefore reducing the risk of fatigue and therefore injury:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[...] holding the hold the wearer's ankle substantially more firmly [...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where we get to the ""the force needs to move somewhere else topic (knee)"" which is not evaluated, as so often.</p>

<hr>

<p>The US army <a href=""http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA373522"" rel=""noreferrer"">performed a test</a> on hiking boots in 1999 - quite an interesting read, but with no real value besides that high top boots have different effects on ankles too.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Asolo AFX 535 (boot 10) scored very well as to perceived comfort, prevention
  of slipping, and rate of oxygen consumption during unloaded walking. It performed
  poorly at preventing foot or ankle pain [...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The study also considered </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[...] shielding the foot from rocks and stones [...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>which is obviously a factor if you want to compare high top vs low top boots. It has a slight impact on ankle injuries that <strong>could</strong> be prevented by higher boots, so you might want to factor that in for further research.</p>

<p>I haven't used any purification tablets or boiling (generally) and suffered no ill effects.
I always ensure the water is fast running and 90% of the time it's fed from mountain springs, so I've always assumed it's safe, in fact I'm sure I've read it's generally cleaner than most tap water!</p>

<p>I'm not sure where I picked up this information, I'm pretty sure my Dad used to do this.</p>

<p>There will be very limited chemical pollutants (from fertilizers, etc.) in the water as the area has virtually no arable farming.</p>

<p>Mining is probably the worst potential pollutant but I always check the source of the water(I've been walking in the are since I was very young and know the sources of most of the streams)</p>

<p>Am I mad or risking my health? </p>
","<p>I think your assumptions are correct. To my knowledge in a mountain environment you are quite safe as long as you follow some simple rules, which you mostly already named:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The water was not standing, i.e.</p>

<ul>
<li>it comes from a stream that is rather fast and</li>
<li>the stream is big enough that it is not just a connection of puddles or ponds where the water rinses from one to the other.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>There are no sources of contamination upstream. As you mention, thinkable sources are </p>

<ul>
<li>agricultural areas where fertilizers or herbicides could have been used</li>
<li>meadows, where cattle was present</li>
<li>mining</li>
<li>(quite unlikely) the water runs through some geologic formation where harmful stuff gets washed out.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>As long as you have checked such stuff, you should be quite safe with flowing water in mountain areas. Even the streams of melting water that build up on the surface of glaciers on summer afternoons will be rather fine then.</p>

<h2>If you are in Southern Hemisphere:</h2>

<p>In southern hemisphere, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polaris"" rel=""noreferrer"">The North Star, Polaris</a> is not visible, so You'll need to identify the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crux"" rel=""noreferrer"">Southern Cross</a>, also known as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crux"" rel=""noreferrer"">Crux</a>. The Southern Cross is constellation that has 5 starts, the 4 of them being brighter than the other and angled together and quite far away from the 5th star, Acrux aka <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Crucis"" rel=""noreferrer"">Alpha Crusis</a>. Draw an imaginary line towards the ground from the axis that intersects Acrux. That is the south, so the north will be exactly opposite to it and behind you.</p>

"Why are tourniquets not recommended as a first aid for a snakebite?","7251","","<p>Why are tying the tourniquets or restricting bandages not recommended or in fact to be avoided to treat a snakebite before getting the proper medical attention?</p>

<li><a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/q/4798/2303"">What are the first aid precautions to be taken in case of a snake bite?</a> </li>
</ul>
","<p>There are several issues with tourniquets for snake bite:</p>

<h2>It's likely too late anyway</h2>

<p>The venom will spread rapidly though your system (as Weda says, the lymphatic system is the main carrier, not blood). The chances of you getting a tourniquet on before this has happened is minuscule. </p>

<h2>It keeps all the venom in one place</h2>

<p>Even if you do somehow manage to contain the venom, it's all in one place now! This means that a single area gets an incredibly high dose of venom. Bear in mind many snakes deliver a bite strong enough to kill several adult humans, now concentrate all that venom into a single limb. The damage caused is massive. The tissue dies and infection gets in.</p>

<h2>The tourniquet is likely going to damage the limb as much as the bite</h2>

<p>Stopping the blood is going to (obviously) starve the limb of blood.  This is going to cause necrosis (dying off of tissue) which causes infection. Tourniquets are not to be used lightly. They should only ever be used as a last resort to prevent someone bleeding out. A limb that has had a tourniquet applied for a long period of time is a dead limb and will likely need to be amputated.</p>

<h2>Eventually the tourniquet needs to be removed</h2>

<p>So now you have large amounts of damaged tissue, etc in this single limb; eventually someone has to remove this tourniquet or else you're going to lose that limb anyway. Doing so releases all the venom and damaged tissue, necrosis, infection, etc. into your blood stream. Rather than containing the venom, you've concentrated it and released it anyway along with lots of other nasties...</p>

<hr>

<p>The best thing to do if you get bitten, is to get antivenom FAST! Your priority should be this; don't waste your time or effort trying to suck the venom out or contain it. Simply get to the nearest antivenom ASAP.</p>

"I never adjust for true north. Is this bad practice?","7190","","<p>This question (<a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/10227/calculate-true-north-with-a-compass-and-map"">Calculate true north with a compass and map</a>) got me thinking. I rarely bother adjusting compass bearings for magnetic north. Is this bad? I understand the theory but I just rarely bother. It's never seemed to have caused me any problems. </p>

<p>I mostly navigate in mountainous areas, I wonder if this is more relevant in flat featureless areas? Typically the terrain is just as big a navigational aid as the compass (even in low visibility) and the compass points me at the correct ridge, etc.</p>
","<p>This map (and the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_declination"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia article</a>) will explain why you don't have a problem (in the UK, I'm guessing), but others do, elsewhere. </p>

<p>In the UK, you can ignore it at the moment, but you need to understand WHY you're ignoring it :)</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uugm9.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uugm9.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>As an aside, compare this with the declination in 1872... Then, the declination error in the UK would have been between 20 and 30 degrees west!</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FxW4d.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FxW4d.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Typically when walking on a bearing you need to allow a margin of error of about 5°. (ie, when 'aiming off', allow at least 5° of error). So the sub-one degree at present in (most of) the UK isn't a big issue. </p>

<p>One thing other haven't mentioned is the precise impact of ignoring the declination. Let's imagine we need to pace 500 metres on a bearing in thick Welsh fog across typical Welsh moorland to reach a bridge on a stream. We know we can't possibly hit the bridge directly, so we need to 'aim off' to a point upstream, and then walk downstream to find the bridge.</p>

<p>You can only follow a compass bearing accurately to within +/-5° (errors both in working the bearing out on the map, and actually following it on the ground. A 5° error over 500 metres would mean we miss our target by about <strong>44 metres</strong> <a href=""https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=500%20*%20tan%20of%205%20degrees"" rel=""noreferrer"">(500 * tan(5 degrees))</a>, so we'd want to 'aim off' by that amount as a minimum. Let say we aim off by 50m.</p>

<p>Now, if the declination is 1° and we ignore it, our worst case error angle changes to 6°, meaning we could end up 52m from our aim point - very slightly downstream of the bridge.</p>

<p>But if we ignored a declination of 10°, we'd be up to 134m from our aiming point, and so far from the bridge we'd miss it completely.</p>

<p>Of course, there's one thing worse than ignoring declination: That's adding it when you should be subtracting, or vice-versa. The potential 25° error (10° declination, wrongly applied, plus 5° general error) would put you almost 250m from you intended destination.</p>

"What are the dangers of swimming in natural waters?","7182","","<p><em>What are the dangers of swimming in natural bodies of water?</em> In essence I would like to know about all types of waters, but <em>I am mostly interested in sea</em> because it is most relevant to me. Like many people I enjoy taking a swim when at the sea side, and like many people I find that the stronger and bigger the waves the better. But then all the bad sea stories you've heard come back and it's really annoying, because what you constantly hear (at least when you're younger) is not how the sea works, but instead you hear threats and shallow warnings like 'if you swim too far off, the sea might pull you in'. The problem is I (and many other people I know) simply don't know anything about how the sea behaves.</p>

<p><em>Maybe you're aware of some bodies of work for lifeguards or something similar that might shine some light on the matter?</em></p>

<p>Note: The sea side I visit most often is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_Sea"">Baltic Sea</a>'s south-eastern shore (Lithuania).</p>
","<p>This is highly dependent on the type of water as well as the location, but I'll summarise a few things to be aware of. In many locations most of these dangers won't factor in, but they're useful things to bear in mind if you're trying to assess the danger of a particular body of water. I'll focus on the sea here - for other things such as rivers similar things apply (but there's obviously other things to look out for, different kinds of wildlife, waterfalls, etc.)</p>

<p><strong>Currents</strong>: Yes, there are areas of sea that can ""pull you in"". (The same obviously applies for rivers here, but this is less commonly thought of with the sea.) More dangerously, there are also currents that can ""pull you under"". Similarly, and sometimes just as dangerously, there are areas of the sea that can ""pull you along"" the coast horizontally. This can sometimes be dangerous simply because it's much easier to miss, and can pull you into dangerous areas such as:</p>

<p><strong>River outflows</strong>: Along the same guise as currents, but these can often hide at full tide and seem to appear very suddenly and strongly if you move into them.</p>

<p><strong>Quicksand</strong>: Not often thought of when you're in the water, but if you decide to stay on the bottom for a while and hit a patch of this, it can root you to the spot.</p>

<p><strong>Watercraft</strong>: Again, something that's often missed, but stray jetskis (for example) can seriously injure or kill you if they hit you full on.</p>

<p><strong>Hidden depth</strong>: While you can often expect beaches to fall down at a gentle angle, there are often hidden areas that can suddenly drop away. While not an inherent problem if you're a good swimmer, these can often be associated with undercurrents too - so beware. Personally I'll only swim on beaches I'm familiar with at high tide (and have seen at low tide) to try and mitigate this somewhat.</p>

<p><strong>Wildlife</strong>: This varies greatly - some areas can have deadly sharks (or similar) in them, and these risks go without saying! However, bear in mind more common things such as jellyfish (some of which will just give you a nasty sting and others that can be lethal) and crabs (which will give you a nasty nip if feeling threatened.) Know what lives in the waters you're swimming in, and be prepared accordingly.</p>

<p><strong>Sharp rocks</strong>: This goes hand in hand with wildlife in that sharp limpets can also live on rocks, making matters worse - but just because the entrance into the water looks sandy, doesn't mean it is all the way through. If you swim at high tide and stay in while the sea recedes, you may find yourself painfully clamouring over all types of nasties. Same goes if an unexpected large wave throws you against such rocks.</p>

<p><strong>Pollution</strong>: Like any body of water, you should be aware of pollution - especially after storms many runoffs will quickly head into the sea containing a variety of toxins and bacteria. In some countries / areas factories are still permitted to dump waste into the sea directly, in this case I wouldn't even risk getting in the water!</p>

  <p>If I am using a water-pump filter. Is it necessary to combine this with a water purification tablet?</p>

Neither the filter nor the tablets are needed. You're better off focusing your efforts on avoiding the real reason that backpackers are likely to get sick, which is hand-to-mouth contamination. Practice good potty hygiene, and don't share pots with your hiking partners (whose gut flora your body hasn't got a tolerance for).</p>

<p>If you're traveling in the third world, or drinking water that you collected downstream from a poultry farm in Arkansas, that's a different matter. Filters work against protozoan cysts. Tablets kill bacteria and viruses. Another good option to consider is a steripen, which treats water using UV light. It kills cysts, bacteria, and viruses, is more compact than a filter, and is faster than tablets.</p>

<p>Iodine is a nutrient that your body needs. That's why they iodize salt. So the question is not really whether iodine is bad for you but whether a certain amount is good or bad for you. The lethal dose in humans is a couple of grams, and it kills you by oxidizing proteins. A typical concentration used for purifying drinking water is about 3 mg/liter, so by drinking a liter of water you're getting about a thousandth of the lethal dose. For comparison, a gram of iodized salt has about 0.02 mg of iodine.</p>

","<p>Your body does not store significant amounts of water (most of the, usable, water in our body is in blood plasma). Unlike energy which can be stored as fat or carbohydrates, water has no real storage mechanism. This is why you will die of thirst long before you die of hunger.</p>

<p>As such, once your body reaches its optimal hydration point it will expel excess water (you go to the loo). Your kidneys control this process. If you ingest large quantities of water your kidneys will react to expel the excess. No storage will happen. </p>

<p>This can also put extra strain on your kidneys and lower your blood salts level. So even if this was practical it'd be ill advised. Drinking far too much water in a <strong>short period of time</strong> (remember it's not stored, your kidneys will eject the extra water as fast as they can) can lead to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyponatremia"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hyponatremia</a> or (<strong>in extreme cases!</strong>) <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_intoxication"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">water intoxication</a> and even (eventually!) death!

<blockquote>
  <p>13% of the athletes who finished the 2002 Boston Marathon were in a

  <p>Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include nausea and vomiting,

  seizures, and decreased consciousness or coma</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You lose water naturally though sweating, urine, moisture evaporated from your lungs, etc. (you also produce water when you convert glucose to energy but this will be outstripped by your loss of water, typically).</p>

<p>You need to replace lost water constantly. The key to optimal hydration is little and often, because too much and your body will expel it, but too little and you become dehydrated. There's no way to avoid this mechanism.</p>

<ol>
<li>Are very strong for their weight, although ""lightweights"" must have fragile treatment.</li>
<li>Have excellent performance in most ocean conditions.</li>
<li>Last a long time when properly cared for.</li>
<li>Look amazing.</li>
</ol>

<p>Disadvantages</p>

<ol>
<li>Price is 30-50% higher than comparable plastic boat.</li>
<li>Are more prone to spidering when put in contact with rocky shores.</li>
<li>Repair is difficult and should be performed by a trained expert.</li>
<li>Must be be dried thoroughly after use to prevent mold growing in the fiberglass. </li>
</ol>

<h2>Overall</h2>

<p>If you are looking at a high end plastic boat from the likes of Current Designs, Nigel Dennis, Valley, or similar you will likely be happy with the performance unless you are a very high end paddler. Many of the lower priced plastic boats however don't perform well in rougher conditions. </p>

<p>If you are a true performance boater you probably already know that you want a fiberglass boat. Just be prepared to take care of it, and it will serve you well for a long time.  </p>

"How do you dry wet socks when camping/backpacking if it's raining and the socks cannot be hung to dry outside","6693","","<p><strong>How do you dry wet socks when camping/backpacking if it's raining and the socks cannot be hung to dry outside?</strong></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4CT36.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<hr>

<p>I've been compiling a list of recommendations on this subject for a little while.  Please add to the list if you can.  I hope you find this useful.</p>

<ul>
<li>Stuff them inside your thermal underwear (while wearing them), each
sock on top of a thigh, and wear to sleep</li>
<li>Wrap the socks in a hand towel, wring towel tightly, and hold the
wrap as  moisture equalizes between the items</li>
<li>Place a wet sock on each of your hands and warm the socks carefully
beside a low-setting camp stove</li>
<li>Stuff pack towels within sock and allow towels to wick moisture away</li>
<li>Stuff socks into the base of your sleeping bag</li>
<li>Insert an activated hand warmer into each sock</li>
<li>Boil rocks (caution:  rocks can explode) and insert the hot rocks
into the socks</li>
</ul>
","<p>Sleeping with the socks on your torso is the most effective method I have found, and it does not require anything you wouldn't already have. For this, you just:</p>

<ul>
<li>Take socks off</li>
<li>Put them inside your shirt, under <strong>all</strong> layers of clothing. They should be touching your skin.</li>
<li>Sleep</li>
<li>Wake up in the morning with dry socks.</li>
</ul>

<p>This works with a lot of things: socks, gloves, hats, anything that could get wet. You don't need a fire, extra fuel, towels, hand warmer, etc... Putting the socks on your legs also works but your core is a much warmer furnace. A good meal before you go to sleep goes a long way.</p>

<p>You can dry clothing during the day (while you hike) using the same method, just make sure they don't fall out. Sometimes, I put them inside an inner pocket.</p>

<p>I <em>always</em> carry two pairs of socks: one to wear and one to dry. I alternate every night and morning, so that I am constantly wearing dry socks. I have found this to be critically important to be comfortable while being cold or wet.</p>

<p>NOTE: I am assuming synthetic or wool socks. Wearing cotton socks in the outdoors is generally a bad idea. After a few days of this method, your sleeping bag will start to accumulate some moisture (especially bad with down bags), so it's a good idea to dry it out when the weather clears.</p>

"Where can I find an iodine crystal water purification product?","6685","","<p>For years I used a product called Polar Pure for water purification when weekend backpacking. It was an iodine based solution, so not great for a thru-hike, but fine for a week or less. Specifically, it used iodine crystals which slowly dissolve over time and can work for a couple thousand treatments.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the company that makes the product is based in California where iodine is on a list of substances the state is changing regulation on in an attempt to stop crystal meth production.</p>

<p>Are there any companies in Europe or elsewhere that can ship legally to the US that produce something similar to Polar Pure?</p>

<p>The features I am most interested in is a small container that is able to treat thousands of bottles of water over time.</p>
","<p>Polar pure, the most effective water treatment product availble, is now back in stock and availble for sale on amazon.com</p>

<p>I would like to thank everybody for all there support, it was an unfortunately long process due to the ""meth heads"" that were using iodine, the same chemical used in polar pure, to make crystal meth. This caused the dea to create much strictness regarding the sale and purchase of iodine.</p>

<p>Polar pure has been in negotiations with the dea for approximitly 4 years and we are now happy to say we are back in business with limited restrictions.</p>

<p>1 of the restrictions regarding consumers is that polar pure must be sold directly to consumers which is why we began selling them direct to consumer on amazon.com with an authorized distributor by the dea.</p>

<p>The second restriction imposed on consumers is the quantity per purchase. A customer may purchase as many bottles of polar as they see fit however we are only allowed to ship 1 bottle per customer per day. So if a customer purchases 5 bottles of polar pure we would ship 1 each day and the customer would receive 1 each day as well. We apologize for this inconvienance however it is a strict rule enforced by the DEA.</p>

<p>Polar Pure uses a unique chemical process that kill All waterborne bacteria up to 99.99999% including viruses. There is no filter on the market that can kill or cleanse water as effectively and as economically as polar pure.</p>

<p>Recently a new product was released for sale using only a filter and no chemical solution with the claim that is will kill 99.99% of bacteria but makes no claims regarding Water borne viruses which can cause hepatitis!, this is because water filters cannot filter at the necessary micron level needed to kill viruses. Viruses are about 0.004 microns in size, even the best of filter can only reach 0.2 microns in size. </p>

<p>That being said I am now proud to reintroduce polar pure to the market place for people to safely and effectively as well as economically treat water for all their purification needs</p>

"What sleeping bags are needed for a northbound thru-hike of the AT","6676","","<p>If you were attempting a thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail, starting roughly now (being mid to late March) and going northbound, how many sleeping bags and of what types would you need, assuming cost is not an option?</p>

<p>So a little background. I've talked to a number of people who have thru-hiked northbound on the AT, and have heard about the various sleeping conditions. Assuming a pace of about 5 months, would different bags be needed for March in GA, June in VA, August in VT, etc? Obviously I don't plan on carrying more than one bag at a time, but if need be bags could be mailed to spots on the trail at certain dates.</p>

<p>Minimizing weight is always #1 on the priority list, but staying warm up north in the later months would be #2. I've mostly lived in the VA region of the AT, so I am used to backpacking with a very lightweight sleeping bag in summer months. </p>

<p>Also, I'm hoping for this to be information given a usual year, not necessarily the spring going on right now in 2012. I am planning to thru-hike the AT in 2013.</p>
","<p>It somewhat depends on how warm you sleep and how much you're willing to layer up in your bag.  I've met people who claim they used one 30F bag the whole trip (with thick layers at the start, and used as a quilt through the rest of the trip).  I would call them ""ultralight freaks"".</p>

<p>The more normal setup is to start with a 0-20F bag, depending on your normal warmth level, then transition to a 30-45F bag/quilt once the weather turns (and send home the extra layers).</p>

<p>I've only met a few people who used synthetic bags on thru-hikes, and they were all quilt users, so assuming you go for down, I would aim for these companies (in this order):  Western Mountaineering or Feathered Friends, Montbell, Marmot (only 800+ fill, the rest of their bags aren't so good), Mountain Hardware.  There are a bunch more of course, but when you're going to spend 130-150 days in a sleeping bag, it's worth getting one that will still be lofty at the end of your trip, and for that you have to shell out for good down fill.</p>

<p>If you're more interested in quilts, Jacks R Better, or Nunatak if you are literally made of money.</p>

<p>You mentioned a 5 month hike starting in March - by my calculation you would be done in August which should make weather issues moot, even in Maine.  So you would likely be fine with your summer bag til then.</p>

<p>Note I have not hiked the AT, but I have hiked the PCT and CDT, and listened to endless gear talk from my hiking partners.</p>

<p>PS: if you are totally insane, do what this guy I met on the CDT did: used a garbage bag as his sleeping bag for the first half of the AT (he started later though - June).  Sound comfortable?</p>

"What is the proper way to tarp tent to avoid condensation?","6653","","<p>I tried pitching a tarp instead of a tent this weekend.  In worked well, kept off the rain etc, <strong>except</strong> for the condensation.  It was far worse than any condensation I've ever had in a tent.  We had other tents nearby and they didn't experience the same issue.  There were rivulets of water running down the inner underside of the tarp leading me to believe it was not just our breathe condensing.  One of our sleeping bags was totally soaked.  There was one rainy night and one dry night and both nights the condensation was horrible.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a specific way of pitching a tarp setup to prevent this?</strong></p>

<p>A quick google only has answer like ""Well this can occur in any shelter"", but while true, it was definitely MUCH worse in the tarp tent.</p>

<p>For reference (edited with more detail)</p>

<ul>
<li>We had our tarp pitched similar to the method in this, but with a much lower opening and pitch (to keep the rain out): <a href=""http://www.joeldare.com/wiki/_media/backpacking:tarp_tent.jpg"">http://www.joeldare.com/wiki/_media/backpacking:tarp_tent.jpg</a></li>
<li>We got significantly more condensation than breathing alone could account for.  Most condensation ran down the tarp to the ground and even then I could squeeze almost half a liter out of each of the sleeping bags.</li>
<li>The tarp was pitched as above, but with only a 3' opening.</li>
<li>The sides were staked down to prevent airplaning.</li>
<li>The tarp was your classic blue poly tarp: <a href=""http://www.rei.com/product/796850/blue-poly-tarp-12-x-10"">example</a></li>
</ul>
","<p>A poor tarp pitch can lead itself to condensation.</p>

<ul>
<li>Did you use a plastic ground sheet? Water running under the tarp when it's raining can cause a lot of humidity inside the tarp.</li>
<li>Were you pitched on long grass? Plant life can increase condensation under a tarp. This can also be alleviated by a plastic ground sheet.</li>
<li>How close to the ground was your tarp pitched? Was there any breeze going through the tarp?If you don't allow air to freely move then the humidity is simply going to build up under the tarp. Increasing air flow by increasing exposure to outside elements might seem counter intuitive, but it's likely you'll end up considerably drier and warmer inside even if a little rain splashes in from the sides or the wind is constantly blowing on you.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tarp camping is absolutely an advanced technique. There are countless ways to pitch a tarp and it takes knowledge, practice, and experience just like anything else.</p>

<hr>

<p>Expanding my answer some :)</p>

<p>Condensation occurs because it is warmer and more humid inside the tarp than it is outside. If you have a breeze or stronger wind, it's easy to reduce condensation by creating an opening on the windward side and having the opposite side wide open, allowing for good airflow. If it gets to the point where the wind is too cold then you are likely passed the point gathering condensation so you can reduce the wind entrance.</p>

<p>Next on your agenda is to increase the steepness of the tarp sides in the pitch. Steep sides means gravity is pulling the condensation down the sides instead of pooling on a flatter pitch, waiting to drop down on you. A taut pitch is also necessary here because sag in the tarp gives water a place to collect that isn't on the ground.</p>

<p>Camp in higher (and dryer) places. This applies to all camping. Moisture gathers in the valleys and even a spot a few meters higher in elevation can make a difference. Meadows are similarly bad.</p>

<p>And in conditions where condensation is simply unavoidable, the only course of action is to occasionally wipe down the inside with a bandana. Even double wall tents get condensation in conditions like constant rain.. they're just not going to notice it as much thanks to the mesh blocking most water drops.</p>

"Can you boil an egg in dirty water?","6638","","<p>I'm going on a one day hike, and I want to cook an egg whilst on it. I'd like to avoid carrying excess water, and the route goes past a couple of waterfalls and several streams, so there is no problem in acquiring extra water. However, I don't know whether there would be risks from bacteria in the water getting into the egg, meaning I would have to purify the water first.</p>
","<p>First things first. <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/a/5109/2766"">You do not need to purify all water sources</a>. Just because it is not out of a tap does not make it immediately dirty. Most fresh wilderness water (providing it isn't stagnant, etc.) is fine for drinking. </p>

<p>If the water is actually <strong>dirty</strong> (e.g. polluted, stagnant, in a built up area, etc.) Then <strong>no</strong>, don't boil your egg in it. </p>

"Considerations for older campers?","6611","","<p>I grew up car camping with my parents several times a year, but as they've gotten older (early 60s), they basically stopped camping. </p>

<p>Recently, they've expressed interest in camping again but I'm concerned that all of their gear is between 10 and 15 years old, bulky, awkward to assemble, and just an overall pain for them. For example, they have an old tent that's difficult to setup and very heavy (<a href=""https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/28/a7/30/28a730ea91e8f5cac3151e14525c039f.jpg"">kind of like this</a>), and I'm sure sleeping on their old 1"" pads will be unacceptable.</p>

<p>We will always be car camping, cooking over camp stove, etc, so weight/size isn't generally an issue unless it's particularly heavy.</p>

<p>What sorts of considerations, gear, practices, should I/we/they acquire to help them get back into car camping?</p>
","<p>My wife &amp; I are both in our mid-50's, and we stopped going car camping a few years ago largely because of the lack of sleep and difficulty getting into and out of our tent.  Our last trip we were so tired that I was hallucinating on the drive back home &amp; we had to pull over on a mountain road to take a nap before we carried on.</p>

<p>Even the nice mattress suggested in @shemseger's answer didn't solve the problem (we have a Coleman queen sized, very comfortable to sleep on, not so easy to get down onto or back up from).  My biggest problem is arthritic knees, and to a lesser extent, arthritic back.  We've since bought a <a href=""http://www.cabelas.com/product/CABELAS-OUTFITTER-COT/1752509.uts"">very nice cot from Cabela's</a> and a very nice <a href=""http://www.rei.com/product/848570/therm-a-rest-neoair-dream-sleeping-pad"">Thermarest NeoAir Dream</a> mattress for me.  We've yet to take them camping, but being able to sit down on the cot to get dressed/undressed, put on or take off your shoes, is a very-very nice feature.  The air mattress just makes it better.  My wife is much more spry than I am, so sleeping on a good air mattress (which we have, just can't remember what it's called) on the ground is still OK with her, but I think if we ever get back into camping, a cot for her is in the works.  My brother has almost the exact one we bought, and she slept on it last time we visited, and quite liked it.</p>

<p>As far as tents go, ours is still an older, fairly low (as in you can't stand up in it, not even my wife who's 5'-0""), style tent.  If we were to start camping again, we'd look at much higher tents so there's standing room, at least in the center.  It just makes things easier to do when your mobility is somewhat limited.</p>

<p>The recommendation for good chairs is a very good idea as well.  My arthritis makes sitting at picnic benches unpleasant pretty quickly.  We have a couple of very good camp chairs, as well as one of the one's shown in the answer above.  I don't particularly care for it, but my wife will fall asleep in it in moments if given the opportunity.</p>

"When is it OK to hike off trail?","6591","","<p>I visited my local forest preserve recently (in a suburb of Chicago, IL) and found new signs every mile or so that read something to the effect of </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Please stay on the trail so as to preserve the natural environment
  beyond the trail.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Part of the joy for me in visiting a piece of nature is to go <strong>off</strong> the trail from time to time, so I found this new notice a bid disheartening. This particular forest preserve is about 4 miles long and 0.25 miles wide with a small river/stream running through it, and has lots of deer within its boundaries. My initial guess about this new rule is that perhaps because of the small size of the preserve and the amount of people frequenting it, they needed to create this additional restriction to minimize the wear on the surrounding land/habitat.</p>

<p>After doing Google search on ""off trail hiking"" I found at least one national park that says it's OK to do this on their property: <a href=""http://www.nps.gov/dino/planyourvisit/off-trail-hiking.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Off Trail Hiking</a>.  So, I now know that ""hiking exclusively on the trail"" is not a universal rule in the US.</p>

<p><strong>My original question:</strong> How common is this rule of staying strictly on the trail for forest preserves vs. a state/federal forest park?</p>

<p><strong>My updated question (based on some responses below):</strong> How to know whether it is alright to hike off-trail in a particular nature area when there is no signage saying otherwise?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Followup:</strong> The comments below inspired me to take the basic hour-long Awareness Course from the ""Leave No Trace"" website: <a href=""https://lnt.org/learn/online-awareness-course"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Online Awareness Course</a>.
I thought it was very informative in addition to the other info on that site, and helped address my question.</p>
","<h1>Leave No Trace</h1>

<p>I grew up in a place that was surrounded by open wilderness. There are no, ""stay on the trail rules"" there. After spending a lot of time in Parks, where there are a lot of rules, and comparing them to growing up in the lawless wilderness, I have to admit that the Parks are a lot prettier. Visiting the wild trails and campgrounds from my youth now is kind of disheartening, because the lack of regulations has basically destroyed the areas compared to how I remember them as a kid.</p>

<p>This question really ventures into <em>Leave No Trace</em> ethics. Even if you're not in a Park or forest reserve, the fact that you <em>can</em> go off trail shouldn't serve as an invitation to indiscriminately trample around in the forest. Even the wild animals will make trails and stick to them, that's what most of the trails in the woods back home were; game trails made by elk, bears or mountain sheep. If I'm venturing into untamed forrest, and find a game trail, I'll typically follow it for as long as I can. </p>

<p>As a rule of thumb, always stick to the trail, especially in frequented areas. In places where venturing off trail is allowed, try to do your best to minimize your impact on the forrest floor. Back home we had a lot of deadfall in the lodgepole pine forests. So we could actually move through the woods without touching the ground by walking on the fallen logs. Avoid stepping on vegetation, especially soft mossy fragile areas, and look for routes that follow more rocky ground. </p>

<p>To answer your question, be responsible and do your best to make sure you're familiar with the rules for the area you're in. If you are in an area where hiking off trail is permissible, please be respectful, minimize your impact on nature while you do, and for the sake of future outdoor enthusiasts; <strong>Leave No Trace</strong>.</p>

"Are longer kayaks faster than shorter ones?","6573","","<p>I've been researching which kayak I'd like to buy, and I keep coming across the notion that longer kayaks are faster than shorter ones. I can understand that shorter kayaks have a greater tendency to alter course with each stroke, thus affecting your overall forward velocity, but if you correct for this in your calculations, it seems to me that a longer kayak would have more overall surface area than a shorter one, and would thus be slowed.</p>

<p>It is perhaps the case that this slowing of the longer kayak is not as pronounced as the loss of forward velocity experienced by the shorter kayak. Is there something else physically going on that affects the kayak's performance in the water that I'm not thinking of?</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr: is there any truth to the fact that, all things being equal, a longer kayak will have a higher top speed for a given kayaker, and if so, why?</strong></p>

<hr>

<h2>Edit</h2>

<p>Note that I ask about length specifically. In other words, two boats of identical design and type, with identical beam widths, identical hull materials, and the same pilot.</p>
","<p><strong>Executive summary: All else equal, a longer boat will have a greater hull speed. A greater hull speed means less drag and hence greater speed for a given amount of ""paddling effort"". Hence, longer kayaks can be said to be faster than shorter ones.</strong></p>

<p>The bit you're missing is that boats make waves, and these waves can make it harder to go fast. Selectively cutting out some sentences from <a href=""http://antrimdesign.com/heavy-boats-light-boats-and-hull-speed.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A boat displaces its own weight in water. When the boat is moving, it must push that much water out of the way as it goes forward. Each boat creates a bow wave and a stern wave. When a boat reaches ""hull speed"" the bow and stern waves coincide to make one huge wave system. A heavy boat gets trapped in its own wave system. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kayaks aren't heavy boats but they generally follow this rule, and generally follow the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hull_speed"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hull speed</a> rules. If you look up those rules then you will see that the length of the waterline is the crucial factor with a longer waterline giving a higher hull speed. This is because the resistance offered by the standing wave is greater than the friction of a larger wet surface area. If you think about it this makes sense because a primary advantage of water transport is hugely reduced friction compared to ground transportation.</p>

<p>If you aren't convinced yet you can look at the experimental results and pretty charts found <a href=""http://www.paddlinglight.com/articles/tutorial/how-much-faster-is-the-longer-kayak/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>. Their research showed that the longer kayak in their test set had the least drag, but the smallest boat at times was easier to paddle than the medium boat. So in practice a longer kayak will most likely be fastest, but ultimately a better designed but slightly shorter kayak might be faster.</p>

<hr>

<p>(Just for fun)</p>

<p>Another thing to keep in mind is a longer kayak gives you more <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4hb84A9h28"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">room for passengers</a>.

<li>Poison Ivy (smoke can cause lung damage in some cases)</li>

<p>In addition, be aware that any wood containing sap (pine for instance) will tend to spit, so don't cook directly on such a fire, otherwise your food may get coated! These are generally OK to use if your food is well above the fire though.</p>

<p>Increase distance before you increase weight.  I would not recommend adding weight until you can hike 5 miles comfortably. </p>

<p>Once you get to 5 miles, start carrying an empty pack.  Next add your layer clothes (maybe it's cool enough for a jacket, but not needed when you warm up)  Next add just a water bladder for drinking.  To the extent that you can, I recommend packing things you will actually hike with.  One, the weight is more representative, and two, the weight is going to be dispersed more realistically for actual hiking.  If you train with other things in your pack just for weight you are more likely to train for a pack that's off balance.</p>

<p>Buy and learn how to use hiking poles.  They really do help, even starting out.</p>

<p>If at all possible, exercise doing something you like, or in a place you like.  If training is just misery you go through to learn to hike, you're less likely to train (and hike).  Pick the day, time, and place that you are <em>least</em> likely to skip every week.  Pick someone to go with you who will encourage you to never miss a hike.</p>

<p>If you seriously overweight, I would suggest first shedding the pounds by taking up swimming.  This will greatly reduce the strain on your knees.</p>

"Most efficient training before alpine hiking/climbing?","6434","","<p>I am planning a trip to the Alps, where I'll do some mountaineering, mostly on rocks (little or no ice) at altitudes around 4000 m. I expect to do mostly scrambling, with only a few places per day where we'll need to climb with protection.</p>

<p>In the time left (a few months), I would like to improve my fitness. I can devote 30-60 minutes a day and a few additional hours at weekends.</p>

<p>Which types of exercise should I do, to prepare my body most effectively?</p>

<ul>
<li>Running
<ul>
<li>How important is it to do interval training?</li>
<li>Is it important to run uphill? Downhill? If yes, how steep?</li>
<li>Should I carry weight?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Walking
<ul>
<li>I can devote a few hours at weekends to hiking with weight. How important is this? Should I carry the same amount of weight that I expect to use in the mountains? Maybe more? Or should I carry less, and aim for speed instead?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Biking
<ul>
<li>I do mountainbiking for fun, but I feel that it doesn't give me much advantage in fitness for mountains. Is there any way to adjust mountainbiking for this specific purpose?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I do gym and rock climbing 2-3 times a week. Do I need any other anaerobic exercises?</li>
</ul>
","<p>Instead of running or walking, I recommend you go to the gym and do the <strong>Stairmaster</strong>. This will provide an aerobic workout while building the muscles you need for hiking and scrambling. This is what I do to get in shape for backpacking trips.</p>

<p>Edit 3/5/2015: Providing an answer to anatols questions in the comments:
I use the Stairmaster 4-5 times a week, 30 minutes each. The speed will depend on your aerobic profile: the idea is to spend the first five or ten minutes building up to your target heart rate, and spend the remainder of the workout keeping it within the target range. You can search online for ""aerobic target heartrate"" for details. I carry a small electronic pulse-meter to measure my heartrate. Although after you've done this a few times you'll get to know your body and you can pretty accurately guess your heartrate without it. You can use the Stairmaster with or without backpack. I recommend both. With the backpack will greater strengthen the specific muscles and better simulate the backpacking experience. Without backpack is just as good for your heart too.</p>

"Are barberries edible?","6422","","<p>Barberries are so common around here that there would be enough for a fruit serving a day for quite a while. But there is a problem: I do not know whether or not they are edible. Are they edible in any quantity?</p>
","<p>I often found myself following these steps from <a href=""http://www.sassurvivalguide.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Lofty Wiseman's Survival Guide</a>, even though I was not in a life or death emergency situation, and never had any problems. It allows you to safe check all vegetation. These methods have proved themselves on several occasions during my time in the army. 
I am not encouraging anyone to use this method in a non-survival situation, unless he/she feels comfortable doing so. </p>

<p>Always adopt the following procedure when trying out potential new food plants, only one person testing each plant. NEVER take short cuts – complete the whole test. If in any doubt, do NOT eat the plant. Should stomach trouble occur, relief can be gained by drinking plenty of hot water; do not eat again until the pain goes. If it is severe, induce vomiting by tickling the back of the throat. Charcoal is a useful emetic. Swallowing some will induce vomiting and the charcoal may also absorb the poison. White wood ash mixed to a paste with water will relieve stomach pain.</p>

<p><strong>INSPECT</strong>
Try to identify. Ensure that a plant is not slimy or worm-eaten. It will be past its best, with little food value other than the grubs or worms upon it. Some plants, when old, change their chemical content and become toxic.</p>

<p><strong>SMELL</strong>
Crush a small portion. If it smells of bitter almonds or peaches – DISCARD.</p>

<p><strong>SKIN IRRITATION</strong>
Rub slightly or squeeze some of the juice onto a tender part of the body (under the arm between armpit and elbow, for instance). If any discomfort, rash or swelling is experienced – DISCARD, reject in future.</p>

<p><strong>LIPS, TONGUE, MOUTH</strong>
If there is no irritation to the skin proceed in the following stages, going on to the next only after waiting five seconds to check that there is no unpleasant reaction:</p>

<p>• Place a small portion on the lips</p>

<p>• Place a small portion in the corner of the mouth</p>

<p>• Place a small portion on the tip of the tongue</p>

<p>• Place a small portion under the tongue</p>

<p>• Chew a small portion</p>

<p>In all cases: if any discomfort is felt, such as soreness to the throat, irritation or stinging or burning sensations – DISCARD, reject in future.</p>

<p><strong>SWALLOW</strong>
Swallow a small amount and WAIT FIVE HOURS. During this period eat or drink NOTHING else.</p>

<p><strong>EATING</strong>
If no reactions such as soreness to the mouth, repeated belching, nausea, sickness, stomach pains, griping pains in the lower abdomen or any other distressing symptoms are experienced, you may consider the plant safe.</p>

<p><strong>WARNING</strong>
POISON! There are two fairly common poisons in the plant world, but both are easily detectable:
Hydrocyanic acid (Prussic acid) has the taste and smell of bitter almonds or peaches. Most notable example is the cherry laurel (Prunus laurocerasus), with laurel-like leaves, which contains a closely allied poison. Crush the leaves and remember the smell. Discard ALL plants with this smell.
Oxalic acid, whose salts (oxalates) occur naturally in some plants, for instance wild rhubarb (mostly in the leaves) and wood sorrel (Oxalis acetosella). Recognizable by the sharp, dry, stinging or burning sensation when applied to the skin or tongue. Discard ALL plants which fit this description.
• AVOID any plant with a milky sap, unless positively identified as safe (such as dandelion).</p>

<p>• AVOID red plants, unless positively identified, especially in the tropics. The red-streaked stalk of wild rhubarb is edible but its leaf is poisonous. Hemlock has reddish-purple splotches on its stem.</p>

<p>• AVOID fruit which is divided into five segments, unless positively identified as a safe species.</p>

<p>• AVOID grasses and other plants with tiny barbs on their stems and leaves. With a magnifying glass you can see them as hooks rather than straight hairs and they will irritate the mouth and digestive tract.</p>

<p>• AVOID old or wilted leaves. The leaves of some trees and plants develop deadly hydrocyanic acid when they wilt – including blackberry, raspberry, cherry, peach and plum. All may be safely eaten when young, fresh and dry.</p>

<p>• AVOID mature bracken (Pteridium aguilinium). It destroys vitamin B in the body, setting up a peculiar blood condition which can cause death. </p>

"One-day hike around Prague","6371","","<p>I'm planning on visiting Prague and I was wondering if there are any nice one-day (two-day tops) hikes that I could do around there.</p>

<p>It doesn't have to be in the mountains, although that would be best. I can settle for a really nice long walk in a neighboring forest trail or something along those lines.</p>

<p>As long as I have some nice views, interesting vegetation and maybe some wild life - I'm happy!</p>
","<p>It depends a lot on what exactly you mean by ""around there"".  While there are no real mountains in the immediate area around Prague, you can find a number of great places to hike there.  If you a willing to go a bit further, you can find some nice mountains, too. Also, I am not sure if by two day hike you mean a backpacking trip with sleeping outdoors, or if you plan to find some other means of accomodation. </p>

<p>I can give you some information that is based on my own experience from over 20 years ago, together with chats with friends and information availabe on the web. </p>

<p>First, two useful pieces of information everyone looking for hiking or backpacking opportunities in Czech Republic:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The country is crisscrossed by an extensive system of inteconnected hiking trails, that allows you to get on foot from pretty much any place to any other place. The system is maintained by the <a href=""http://www.kct.cz/cms/czech-tourist-klub-kct"" rel=""noreferrer"">Klub Českých Turistů (Czech Tourist Club)</a>, and consists of two components: trail markings and corresponding maps.  Each trail is assigned one of four colors: red, yellow, green or blue.  It used to be that red color was reserved for long distance trails, often following a long mountain range or a similar such feature, yellow trails were shorter, branching from the red ones, and green and blue were reserved for local or connecting trails, but as far as I can tell, that is no longer strictly followed. </p>

<p>The trails are marked in terain by trail marks that look like a horizontal color stripe (red, yellow, green or blue) between two horizontal white stripes, like this:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kzY1M.png"" alt=""Czech trail marks""></p>

<p>They are usually found on trees, rocks or buildings, and can <a href=""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Modr%C3%A1_zna%C4%8Dka_na_kameni.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">look like this</a>.</p>

<p>At places where the trail changes direction, it is often marked using an arrow version of the mark:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3eLyi.png"" alt=""Trail mark arrow""></p>

<p>There are several other variations, marking a spring or well, historic ruin, vista point etc.  Intersections of trails usually have pointers telling you what direction to take to get to various locations, as well as their distances in kilometers. </p>

<p>The other component of the trail system is a collection of maps, that have the color coded trails mark in them.  They are usually quite detailed and easy to use.  You can buy them in any bookstore, newspaper stand, and in many museum and souvenir shops.  The online map server at <a href=""http://mapy.cz/#x=14.269430&amp;y=49.938782&amp;z=12&amp;l=16"" rel=""noreferrer"">mapy.cz</a> has a setting that shows the trails as well. </p></li>
<li><p>The second thing is of interest to backpackers.  While it is illegal to ""wild camp"" in Czech Republic, in most areas it is a fairly common practice.  If one is smart about it, one can usually avoid detection, and even when discovered, if you clearly behave well, do not damage the environment, do not litter etc, and behave politely, forest or park rangers often let you go.  There is some dispute about it, but it seems that it is actually legal to sleep in the woods as long as you do not make a fire and do not build any kind of shelter.  There are number of exceptions, mainly in national parks and nature preserves, but in general, you can sleep in woods if you do it in a smart way. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now, back to hiking opportunities near Prague. There are actually several shorter but nice hikes.  One of them is the <a href=""http://mapy.cz/#x=14.386238&amp;y=50.046417&amp;z=13&amp;l=16"" rel=""noreferrer"">""Prokopské valley""</a>.  You can either take a bus to the Zlíchov station and take the blue trail up to the valley, or, from Jinonice subway station, yellow and green trails both go down. The valley has a number of interesting geological features. Other interesting areas are ""Modřanská rokle"" on the other side of the river, area around Roztoky and Suchdol in the north, the Botič valley in the east, and several other smaller areas.  These are all shorter hikes, partly through urban or suburban environment, but can be quite nice. </p>

<p>For longer hikes, and more natural ones, I recommend the region in the south of Prague.  It is more hilly, with some prety good hiking.  </p>

<p>Probably the most mountain like part of this region is the area called Brdy.  It is a range of wooded hills that stretch from the southern edge of Prague for some 50 or 60 km south west past Příbram.  Unfortunately the central part of this range belongs to the military and is mostly closed to the public, but the northern part has some very nice hiking.  There are several ways how to get there from Prague: </p>

<ul>
<li>The main red trail starts at what I remember used to be a small insignificant city <a href=""http://mapy.cz/#x=14.383572&amp;y=49.953583&amp;z=14&amp;l=16"" rel=""noreferrer"">bus stop at Zbraslav-Báně</a>.  From there it continues the entire length of the ""northern"" Brdy.  I highly recommend to follow it all the way to the Plešivec mountain.  It would make a good long one day hike. If you want to continue for two days, there are number of places to camp for the night in that area.  If you are lucky, you may even find a place with a makeshift shelter and a fireplace. If you do, please treat it gently.  There is a tradition in this region to very carefully clean the fireplace when you are leaving, and to leave a small fir branch pointing in the direction in which you left in the <a href=""http://vandracky.rajce.idnes.cz/PODZIMNI_POLEDNI_POTOKY_-_Brdy_19.10._08_doplneno_17.11./#Brdy_19.10._052.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">middle of it</a>. If zou want to return back to Prague, you can walk down to Hostomice, Jince or another small town and take a local train to Zadní Třebáň, where you switch to the main line and return to Prague. You can also continue further, with several option, perhaps following yellow and green trail further south west.  It skirts the military zone, entering it at several places that are open to public, and follows all the way to the town of Rokycany. Another option is to partially backtrack, return to Dobříš, and follow for example the blue trail to the Vltava valley, which has plenty of local hiking opportunities, and generally good transportation back to Prague. </li>
<li>Instead of trying to find the red trail in Zbraslav, you can take a train from the Smichov train station to either of Dobřichovice, Mokropsy or Všenory.  From any of those stations, you can take a blue trail that will take you up the hill to the main red one.  You can also take a bus to Jíloviště, the bus stop should be on or near the main red trail. </li>
<li>Finally, you can take a train from the Bráník train station to Dobříš, and enter Brdy from that direction. </li>
</ul>

<p>To get some idea what you can see in Brdy, you can look at <a href=""http://www.etf.cuni.cz/~moravec/fotky/english/ind-hreb.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">this site</a>.</p>

<p>Another great area for hiking, less hilly but perhaps more interesting, is just on the other side of the Berounka river.  The ""Český Kras"" (Bohemian Karst) is somewhat more popular and can be, at least in some areas, quite crowded, but if you avaid the most obvious tourist attractions, you can find some excellent hinkng. </p>

<p>Again, there is a number of ways how to get there:</p>

<ul>
<li>For the longest hike, you can actually continue the Prokopske Valley hike described above.  From the central part of the valley, you take a blue trail to Slivenec.  In Slivenec you switch to the red trail, and take it to Kalinův Mlýn, where you switch to a blue trail again.  (You can also get to Kalinův Mlýn from the upper end of the Prokopske Valley, if you take a blue trail from there. From Kalinův Mlýn, you follow the blue trail pretty much south to <a href=""http://mapy.cz/#x=14.309160&amp;y=49.974930&amp;z=13&amp;l=16"" rel=""noreferrer"">Kulivá Hora</a>, where you switch to a red trail towards Karlštejn. </li>
<li>Another option is to take a train from the Smíchov station to Radotín (you shold also be able to get there by a city bus).  In Radotín, you can get directly onto the <a href=""http://mapy.cz/#x=14.342173&amp;y=49.979907&amp;z=13&amp;l=16"" rel=""noreferrer"">red trail towards Karlštejn</a>. </li>
<li>You can also stay on the train for a little longer, get off in Černošice and take a green or blue trail from there.  Both of them will eventually meet the red trail to Karlštejn. </li>
</ul>

<p>You will then follow the red trail through Karlík valley and Mořinka all the way to Karlštejn.  The castle in Karlštejn is a very popular tourist attraction, and can be pretty crowded.  Most visitors take a train or bus to the village, and climb the souvenir shop encrusted road up to the castle. The red trail will bring you to the castle from different side.  You will still have to pass through some of the madness, but you will avoid the worst.  You can visit the castle if you want.  Then continue on the red trail past the castle.  Keep following the red trail till you get to an intersection of several trails called ""Propadlé Vody"".  From there you have number of options, but my favorite always was to take the yellow trail to the north, marked on the map as <a href=""http://mapy.cz/#x=14.145368&amp;y=49.968964&amp;z=14&amp;l=16"" rel=""noreferrer"">""Svatojánský okruh""</a> (St. John circle).  It will take you past the Arnika cave, through some interesting long abandoned limestone quarries all the way to a vist point on the top of the cliff overlooking the St. John valley and the monastery. Bacrtacking a bit and following the trail further will take you down to the valley. </p>

<p>From there, you have several options.  You can take the blue trail north and catch a train or bus in Vráž.  You can stay on the red trail and end up in the city of Beroun, with several options for transportation back tp Prague.  Or you can take the yellow trail south to Srbsko, where you can take a train back to Prague.  </p>

<p>If you want to hike more, you have a number of options, including those:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can pass through Beroun westwards to Nižbor, where another area with numerous hiking opportunities opens: <a href=""http://mapy.cz/#x=13.912548&amp;y=49.988656&amp;z=11&amp;l=16"" rel=""noreferrer"">Křivoklátsko</a>.  You can spend some time there, or you can turn south through Zbiroh, and eventually end up in Brdy.</li>
<li>If you end up following the yellow trail to Srbsko, instead of getting on a train, you can cross the river and the train tracks, and follow the yellow trail throu th ebeautiful Koda valley, then to Koněprusy, where you can visit some very nice and quite famous caves. You can then follow the yellow trail to the Popovice train station, or turn south, and by a combination of marked trails and roads get to Brdy. </li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, my third suggestion is the Sázava river valley. Take a train from the Bráník train station to Pikovice, take a red trail, cross the river and follow it upstream (again, depending on how much time you have, you may want to start closer to Prague, or even in Prague. You can catch the same red trail in Zbraslav or Vrané.  In fact, it is just a different part of the same red trail that leads through Karlštejn.)  The trail will closely follow the Sázava river, with a nice view of its rapids. You can follow it all the way to Kamený Přívoz, where it will cross the river again.  There you will have several options.  You can take a train back to Prague, follow a series of green, blue, red and yellow trails back to Pikovice or even to Prague, or continue on the red trail to Prosečnice.  From there you can take the yellow trail through Vlčí Rokle (the Wolf Ravine), which is quite interesting and nice. After that you will have a whole scale of possibilities, there are number of trails that you can take, most of them leading you eventually to a train or bus station. </p>

<p>Hopefully this will be at least somewhat helpful.  Enjoy your visit.  Perhaps one more advice: Czechs are generally rather fond of hiking, and many of them know their hiking areas quite well.  If you are going there for a conference, for business, of to visit friends, you may want to ask your hosts where to hike. They will probably be able to give you a better, more current advice, and perhaps they will even go with you. </p>

"Should I get trekking poles for snowshoeing, or stick with ski poles?","6366","","<p>Being an avid skier I have ski poles lying around, so I've always used those.</p>

<p>Do proper trekking poles offer any advantages for snowshoeing? </p>
","<ul>
<li>Trekking poles can telescope down and pack away.  </li>
<li>If you happen to have a shelter that uses trekking poles to hold it up, sometimes you need to be able to set your poles to a different height.  </li>
<li>Some people also like to lengthen/shorten their poles depending on whether they are going down or up hill.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your shelter doesn't require them, I think the answer is ""Ski poles are fine"".  Then, in the rare case where you want to walk without poles, you can tuck them horizontally in the small of your back (through your pack straps).  If you like to go up or down with different length poles, just grasp the ski pole at a different spot on it's body.</p>

"Will Black Bears actually follow you up a tree","6358","","<p>I always see it pointed out, when discussing how to handle/avoid bear encounters, that black bears can climb trees.  Granted, but does that matter?  Has there ever been a case of a black bear pursuing someone up a tree in order to attack them?  </p>

<p>It seems logical to me that bears wouldn't fight in a tree like that unless forced to as they are busy using claws for climbing, but I'm not exactly an expert.</p>
","<p>The question asks for an instance where a bear climbing a tree attacks a human. I found a <a href=""http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/09/06/wash-hunter-chased-up-tree-bitten-by-black-bear.html"">news article</a> of a hunter being attacked by a black bear in a tree.</p>

<p>I don't think this is a completely satisfying answer since the question implies the question: Why would a bear expend the effort to climb up a tree to attack a human? I am not a bear expert but I read this <a href=""http://www.bearsmart.com/about-bears/dispelling-myths/"">article</a> which states that bears are known to kill one another by throwing each other off the tree they're fighting on. So your assumption that the bears are <em>busy using claws for climbing</em> might not be true. In fact, bears are quite capable climbers as shown in this insanely cute <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAB9-VGIkzM"">video</a>.</p>

<p>EDIT: I didn't explicitly answer the first part of the OP: <em>Does it matter?</em><br>
Given the fact that bears are capable climbers, and given that they have inflicted damage while climbing, would lead me to assume that their ability to climb trees does matter when one is trying to avoid being harmed by a bear.  </p>

","<p>The easiest way to carry a <strong>back</strong>pack is on your back. If you're looking for a bag for cycling, then you either need to invest in some pannier bags, or some <strong>bike</strong>packs:</p>

"How to find new poles for old tent?","6330","","<p>I have a nice and small tent I really like that is around 30 years old.  It is from Sierra West, but I don't remember the model name.  Here is a picture so that you can see the size and general construction:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NYgij.jpg"" alt=""""></p>

<p>This tent is held up with two bows of fiberglass rods that fit into each other.  A small bow of 4 rods makes the arch at the foot end, and 6 rods are used at the head end.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, one of the rods has just broken:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nZW9I.jpg"" alt=""""></p>

<p>The rod is 14 inches long, the fiberglass part is 6.5 mm in diameter, and the outer diameter of the aluminum piece is 9.5 mm.</p>

<p>The fiberglass is cracked near the aluminum sleave, and it is rough with fibers sticking out at the right end where it fits into the aluminum sleave of the next piece.</p>

<p>The problem is, the company that made this tent seems to have vanished and I don't know how to get replacement rods.  I'd like to get a complete set of rods, since if this one went the others are probably not far behind.  There seem to be aluminum rods available with bungy cord in the middle, but finding a set that is exactly the length this tent requires seems to be impossible.</p>

<p>Anyone know how to get parts for this old tent, or have any other ideas?</p>

<h2>Added:</h2>

<p>Yes, it's easy to find generic replacement tent poles, but the ones I have seen are all quite different from what my tent uses.</p>

<p>This is a particularly small tent and the radius of curvature is significantly smaller than other tents.  This means the thicker poles that are easy to find would be stressed much more.  Mine are only 6.5 mm diameter, probably for a good reason.</p>

<p>The replacement poles are also much longer than mine.  I suppose the long poles could be cut down, but cutting fiberglass is tricky and can easily damage the material if the right tools aren't used, which I probably don't have since I don't know exactly what the right tool would be.  I am imagining just cutting with a saw would fray the fibers, which is basically cracking the fiberglass, which can't be a good thing.</p>

<p>Another issue is that the pole ends need to fit into the grommets on my tent.  I rather doubt there is such a thing as a standard grommet diameter.</p>

<p>This is not as easy as just Googling for ""tent pole replacement"".  Surely someone here has been thru this process before and has some words of wisdom?</p>

<h2>Added 2:</h2>

<p>This is in response to a comment asking for more details of the rods.<ol></p>

<p><li>The grommets that the end of the tent poles fit into are just circular metal disks with holes in them.  I don't have the tent here, but the inner diameter of these holes is a little larger than the diameter of the tent poles, which is 6.5 mm.  The picture shows a middle piece, but the end pieces have black plastic end caps, with the tips of those being about the same diameter as the fiberglass rod (6.5 mm).</p>

<p><li>The fiberglass rods are solid, so have no inner diameter.</p>

"Will a down sleeping bag recover 100% after being squeezed if it's not for a long time?","6297","","<p>It is well known that a down sleeping bag should be stored as open as possible when not in use, but that can be squeezed and compressed to a very small fraction of its size when necessary (that feature is among down's best appeals).</p>

<p>I would love to know for sure if storing the sleeping bag in a compression bag down to its minimum volume (or, almost that) for several hours, like, 16 in a row, or 24 perhaps, will allow it to recover <strong>fully</strong> when the trip is over; or if over time even short bursts of tight compression like that are going to slowly ruin it.</p>

<p>I'd like to invest in such a piece of jewelry but I'd want to be sure that with proper care it would last for a lifetime or so.</p>

<p>Thank you so much. </p>
","<p>I emailed <a href=""http://featheredfriends.com/"">Feathered Friends</a> and <a href=""http://www.phdesigns.co.uk/"">PHD</a> about this issue. I only got a reply from FF so far:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A compression bag greatly reduces the size of a sleeping bag. There is
  no limitation to compressing down, as long as the down is not being
  stored compressed for an extended period of time, It will not be
  damaged.if you are taking it out and using it everyday. Just don't
  leave it compressed while not on a trip. As for the larger backpacks,
  some people believe compressing down can damage it. That is true for
  lower grades of down, but we only use the finest quality down so that
  does not apply to Feathered Friends products.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is reassuring.
EDIT:
Also PHD got back. With this link, which I couldn't find before asking. And yeah its states that quality down not only does not degrades but actually benefits from occasional compression! From <a href=""http://www.phdesigns.co.uk/cleaning-down-sleeping-bags-and-clothing"">this link</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some years ago, when testing the effects of repeated compression on
  down and various synthetic waddings, we found that after thousands of
  compression cycles the waddings had all lost between 30% and 40% of
  their loft, as expected. By contrast the down was 5% loftier than
  before - the compressions had merely warmed it up! This illustrates
  that down is not the fragile touch-me-not substance some people think.
  Treated right, it will give good service for a very long time.</p>

<h2>I'd like to know which kind of arrow would slow down or kill a bear</h2>

<p>Every arrow with a broad-head (= hunting point) attached. It doesn't matter whether it's made out of wood, aluminium or carbon, if the arrow fits you and your bow. </p>

<h2>Which vital spots should I aim at</h2>

<p>The lethal zone which is in that case the heart and the lungs. </p>

<h2>Which kind of bow should do the job</h2>

<p>Just like the arrow section: every bow on earth can do the job if it's strong enough. Nowadays you would choose a compound or recurve bow. If you like to shoot a long-bow it doesn't matter either. 
The problem is that it has to be incredibly strong. Too strong for most untrained shooters. That leads us to the next point...</p>

<h2>What is the minimum weight of a bow to bring down a bear</h2>

<p>Okay, let's start off with the kinetic energy you need to ""put in the bear"" in the worst case (full featured grizzly bear). It's 70 ft. lb. or 95 Joule.</p>

<p>Check out this chart for example from <a href=""https://www.biggamelogic.com/ArticlesNews/tabid/136/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/288/Calculating-Kinetic-Energy-For-Archers.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Big Game Logic</a>:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hAjj1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hAjj1.jpg"" alt=""Chart""></a></p>

<p>Let's take an arrow which weights 500 grains. It's something one would use to stand against something like a grizzly. To get the energy of 70 ft. lb. it needs to travel with at least 250 fps (feet per second). We need to find a bow which can accelerate a 500 gr arrow to 250 fps. </p>

<p>A <em>Bear Archery Grizzly</em> with 48 pounds manages to accelerate a 503 gr arrow to 140 fps. So approximately you'll need at least 65 pounds. A <em>Bear Archery Grizzly</em> isn't even build with this poundage :) However, back in the days Grizzlies were shot with a 55-60 pound Grizzly-bow (that's why the name). </p>

<p>I'm a well trained archer (about every second day) and would overestimate myself even with a 50 pound bow. </p>

<h2>Which diameter and broad-heads to use for bears</h2>

<p>A small diameter since you need penetration. Shafts like the Axis should do the job. I would recommend three-bladed broad-heads cause bears have quite thick skin and you want them to bleed, don't you?</p>

<hr>

<p>P.S.: <em>Just a safety advice: a bear isn't something to f%!§ with even with a gun =) An untrained (in terms of archery) person is never ever able to bring one down even with a perfectly set up compound bow.</em></p>

"How can I hike across the Grand Canyon if I don't have a backcountry permit?","6176","","<p>I am going to try to hike across the Grand Canyon in May, from the South Rim to the North Rim, and back. Unfortunately, I have discovered that I am probably too late to secure a back-country permit for the week I plan to be there. </p>

<p>My original plan had been to camp at Bright Angel, then 2 nights at Cottonwood (whilst I hit the North Rim and then came back), then again at Bright Angel, and back to the South Rim.</p>

<p>My question is, what is my best option for still taking my hike? </p>

<p>Here are some ideas that occurred to me, but I'd like to hear from people who have done it if any of these are feasible:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Try to full cross the canyon, each way, in a single day, so as to not need it. (Is this really feasible? I'm fat, I'm 40, and I do want to see things along the way!)</p></li>
<li><p>Pray hard that a permit is available when I show up. (I hear they reserve a percentage, but don't know how likely it is that I could secure one.)</p></li>
<li><p>Set out even without a permit, and just find a discrete place, not in a campground, where park rangers won't look for a permit. (Dodgy in the truest sense of the term - but what happens if they do find me?)</p></li>
<li><p>Just show up in the campground and take my chances without a permit.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>On the bright side, I will be in the area from May 12 - May 22, but knowing how to plan would be helpful.  (Zion and Bryce both seem too close to pass up)</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>For future use, backcountry permits open up on the first of the month four months prior.  On February 1st, for example, all of June becomes open to reservation.  I'll save you the time of calculating - May opened up in January, and by February 24th, there was NOTHING in any campground in the corridor any time in all of May.  Phantom Ranch was fully booked (they open up 13 months in advance).  Moral of the story - April, May, and June are busy.  Make your reservations ASAP!</sup></p>
","<p>In the corridor zone (where you are planning) you are only allowed to camp at designated campgrounds, which are secured on a reservation basis. If they are full, of the options you list, <strong>2. Pray hard a permit is available when I show up</strong> is your best bet. </p>

<p>The park leaves a percentage of permits unreserved for the main corridor (which includes the Bright Angel trail, and the North and South Kaibab) to accommodate walk-ins on a first-come first-serve basis. They are limited.</p>

<p>Lets look at the others:</p>

<p><strong>1. Try to cross in a single day</strong>: That's how people die.</p>

<p><strong><em>Hiking in the Grand Canyon is like no hiking you have ever experienced.</em></strong></p>

<p>OK, people do rim-to-rims, but this is not recommended for anyone first visiting the canyon - even experienced hikers from other regions at the top of their game. The desert environment, coupled with the vast elevation loss (and gain) creates a hiking situation most people can't comprehend. Its the descent that really gets you: hiking down stairs for 7-9 miles (11-15km). </p>

<p>The best description I have heard from a participant on my trips: ""<em>Put on your boots, nail a 2x4 across the bottom of them, stick your feet up in the air, and have your friend pound on that 2x4 with a sledge-hammer for 6 hours.</em>""</p>

<p>And regarding your last criteria (seeing things), between the pain, your heat exhaustion, dehydration, and the rush, you won't see anything along the way.</p>

<p><strong>3&amp;4. Set out even without a permit, clandestine camp, or show up at the campground</strong>: Aside being illegal, that is just plain rude.</p>

<p>The permit system does not exist to ruin your vacation, but rather tries to maximize the number of people that can <em>enjoy</em> the resource without <em>destroying</em> the resource, OR destroying the experience of others. The main corridor is already the most highly-traveled place in the canyon.</p>

<p>It is also one of the most well-patrolled regions of the canyon, so your presence would be noticed. If you are caught, you will be charged with a federal misdemeanor (Federal misdemeanors can carry fines of up to $5,000 and six months in jail.)</p>

<p><strong>As a 5th option, you can get permits to wild-camp in one of the neighboring zones.</strong></p>

<p>Wild-camping is allowed in different zones, and if you head east or west on the Tonto trail a mile or two, there might be more availability. However, those areas do not have ready access to water, or other amenities, so it is imperative you are experienced with desert back-country travel.</p>

<p><strong>A 6th option</strong> is to check the availability of rooms at <a href=""http://www.grandcanyonlodges.com/lodging/phantom-ranch/"">Phantom Ranch</a> located at the bottom of the canyon.</p>

"How can I clear spiderwebs in my path while hiking?","6161","","<p>I went hiking this weekend in a national forest on trails that see little use.

"How to tow a canoe with a bicycle?","6159","","<p>There are a few pictures on the internet of people towing canoes with bicycles, there are even complete solutions that you can purchase for the task.  But what is really involved, what are the challenges and the solutions?</p>

<p>Related <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/6948"">How to carry a bicycle in a canoe?</a></p>
","<p>This answer is based on a 17-foot plastic Coleman canoe with an aluminium frame. The length and the plastic increase the challenges. I have over 100 miles experience now, with legs of 14 to 15 miles. </p>

<p>After much online research I purchased a <a href=""http://www.seattlesportsco.com/paddling/boat-carts/atc-all-terrain-center-cart.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Seattle Sports All Terrain Canoe Center Cart</a>; there is an option that includes a tow bar to connect it to your bike, but that is for a max of 16 foot canoe.  The Seattle sports hitch is a low mount hitch; most of the home made solutions you find on Google are high mount: see <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/25282/what-are-the-safety-concerns-of-a-high-vs-a-low-mount-trailer-hitch"">What are the safety concerns of a high vs a low mount trailer hitch?</a></p>

<p>Pretty much all the commercially available carts are designed with a couple of padded rest points that your canoe or kayak will rest on.  This might be OK for short distances or with an empty hard-shell (fiberglass type) boat with nothing in it, but for a relatively soft plastic canoe, loaded with gear, traveling more then a mile or so, in warm (or hot) weather, the issues start to build up.</p>

<p>Problem one: a trailer hitch.  See <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/27234"">Trailer connection, off the shelf parts and proven performer</a>, for my solution.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JAGlI.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JAGlI.jpg"" alt=""the hitch""></a></p>

<p>Problem two: keep the canoe on the cart. The strap that comes with dolly is not going to work, I tried several variations and a single strap is problematic for any distance.  Every time you hit a pothole the dolly moves a bit.  Pretty soon the dolly has slid back and is partly sideways; your 3-foot wide canoe is making a 5-foot wide swath behind you. I tipped the canoe over on my first outing, brushing against a pole, had to stop every mile and recenter it.</p>

<p>Solution is four straps; the image shows 5, but the center strap turned out not to be required (and is more likely to wear (<em>break</em>) when you brush against things. Two straps pulling the dolly back and center, two straps pulling the dolly forward and center.  I used 15-foot ratchet straps in the front, and wrapped around the trailer hitch before hooking to the seat.  You don't need much pressure; it just needs to be snug.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/e0Aee.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/e0Aee.jpg"" alt=""Straps ""></a></p>

<p>Problem three:The plastic hull is resting on the padded bars of the cart; this was okay at first, but the warm weather and time started causing the canoe to be come deformed. I tried using a strap between the bars for the keel to rest on, but I started to notice the canoe rubbing on the cart wheels (<em>and damaging the canoe</em>).</p>

<p>Solution build a wood deck on the dolly. There is a space for the keel; now most of the weight is carried by the keel. The large flat area (<em>shaped to minimize pressure points</em>) provides balance and are helps to reshape the hull.  It is easier to get and keep the boat centered on the cart.  This added a couple of pounds, but it has been more then worth it.  The canoe can't rub against the tires. I actually picked up about 2 miles per hour on the first outing with the wood deck. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JeJBx.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JeJBx.jpg"" alt=""Canoe on Dolly""></a></p>

<p>Although not shown on any of the images above, I also used a bungee cord to support/lift the hitch a way up the seat post.  Without it the hitch would occasionally drag on the rear tire.</p>

<h2>Pulling the Canoe</h2>

<p>Actually towing the canoe is not as bad as I had expected.  </p>

<p>It is heavy, and the cart tires are relatively wide. Racing bikes have skinny tires for a reason: less friction.  Here, I have all terrain tires on the bike and the canoe dolly.  All of which means it is harder to go fast. It also means you go over rough terrain easier and have more control, so it is trade-off.</p>

<p>It is long, I mean really long.  The national move yourself trailer rental company (US) does not even rent a trailer as long as the canoe. <strong>AND</strong> because the dolly is in the center of the canoe, it pivots in the center of the canoe when you turn.  When taking a sharp corner the back of the canoe can swing out 8½ feet (nearly 3 meters): if you are on the center line of a road, and turn sharp, the canoe could hit a car parked on the side of the road.  I recommend you practise turning, well away from things that might get damaged (<em>e.g. in an empty parking lot</em>).</p>

<p>With some practice, you can tow on roads without difficulty and on most areas of bike paths fine.  Slow down for corners; get off and walk everything around narrow corners.  Sometimes the bike must be carried or disconnected from the canoe to make it through tight corners or narrow areas.</p>

<p>My canoe is about 3 feet (1 meter) wide; many bike paths in the US have posts to prevent motor vehicles from going on the path, These seem to mostly have about 3½ to 4 feet of space between them so the canoe does fit. You will want to walk through while learning but now I am able to bike through about 95% of them.  Get lined up well before you get to the posts and don't turn until the entire canoe is through (the tail will swing and hit a post).</p>

<p>Expect the canoe to rub in tight spots even if you are moving it by hand; bring extra straps to connect it to the dolly.</p>

","<p>The term you're looking for is <strong>""low-residue diet""</strong> or ""<strong>low-residue meal</strong>"" (for some reason, the medical community tends to avoid the term ""poop"" in their technical terminology). Simply googling on those terms will get you a lot of good advice; <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/ibd-crohns-disease/low-residue-diet-foods"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">WebMD</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_residue_diet"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a> are good starting points.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A low residue diet is a diet designed to reduce the frequency and
  volume of stools while prolonging intestinal transit time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In general, you'll want to avoid dietary fibre. Minimize wholegrains, fruit, vegetables, and seeds. Tender meat, eggs, and dairy are good choices. Carbs should be of the heavily refined variety -- for example, white bread and white pasta. Pilots on long missions traditionally go for steak and eggs as their pre-flight meal.</p>

<p>Note that full digestion (from eating to defecation) can take <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/digestive-system/expert-answers/faq-20058340"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">well over 24 hours</a>, so start your low-residue diet a day or two in advance.</p>

<p>Finally, I would <strong>very</strong> strongly advise to have a plan B! No matter how carefully you plan your diet, you can't 100% guarantee sealed bowels for your entire hike, and in that case it's much better to be prepared. If you're in a no-poop zone, carry <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/q/4196/8887"">a WAG bag, poop tube, or similar</a>.

  weight and durability.</p>
  
  <p>For instance, a sport climber who is projecting hard routes is taking
  a zillion falls that are all relatively short—that puts a huge amount
  of stress on one very small section of rope, and the rope simply loses
  its elastic properties there and goes flat. Contrast that to the trad
  climber who is falling much, much less, but is usually on terrain that
  is less than vertical—this subjects the rope much more to abrasion of
  the sheath. Then there’s the ice and alpine climber who virtually
  never falls, but is routinely dragging the rope over sharp edges,
  blocky terrain, getting it wet and drying it, etc.</p>
  
  <p>... how climbers wear it out—if they wear it out from falling a lot,
  or if they wear it out from abrasion on rough rock. ... one of the
  differences in construction we use that reflects these design
  priorities is the relative thicknesses of the core vs the sheath — we
  can make two 10mm ropes, one having a thin core and thick sheath, and
  the other having a thick core and thin sheath. All other things being
  equal, the rope with the thick core and thin sheath will hold more
  falls before going flat, but wear faster from abrasion; and vice
  versa.</p>
  
  <p>... so we sacrifice the falls-held rating—which reflects to a large
  degree how long a rope will last under repeated hard falls—in order to
  build a rope that will be ultra-durable under very harsh abrasion
  conditions and will be more difficult to scrape through to the core.
  ...</p>
  
  <p>Some of our ultra-thin single ropes like the Serenity 8.9mm have a
  relatively thin sheath because even with all the tricks we can muster
  we still need a certain amount of core in order to pass the UIAA test
  for a single rope—in this case we use a thinner sheath to achieve a
  very low weight and thin diameter, but we do thins knowing that this
  is a very specialized rope that is only appropriate under very
  specific circumstances. ...
  <strong>People also need to recognize that even though these are single ropes,
  and even though the diameter is larger than our Genesis half ropes,
  under conditions where the main danger is cutting or abrasion the
  thicker rope might actually be LESS durable and have a lower safety
  margin.</strong></p>

<h3>Climber's size is very important</h3>

<p>The <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/q/508/133"">UIAA fall testing</a> standard uses an 80kg mass for single ropes, and a 55kg mass for double (half) ropes.  From <a href=""http://www.supertopo.com/climbing/thread.php?topic_id=833631&amp;tn=165"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""Whitehorse Jeff"" on SuperTopo.com</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In answer to the oft repeated question:"" Why do they test half ropes
  singly with only 55kg"", I was the American delegate (of the AAC) on
  the UIAA Safety Commission when the Half Rope Standard was put in
  place. Tests done at the time by Pit Schubert of the DAV (German
  Alpine Club) showed that any half rope that would withstand 5 UIAA
  test falls with a 55 kg test mass would also withstand one UIAA test
  fall with the 80kg mass. The argument presented to the members of the
  Commission at the time was that it would be impossible to get the
  lighter ropes which climbers (and guides ) wanted, to pass a harsher
  test, and that the real goal was to insure that a half rope would
  sustain at least one of the worst imaginable falls in the field, that
  being the fall represented by the UIAA single rope test. The repeated
  falls caught with the 55kg mass were accepted as the minimum
  repeatable test standard to insure this desired result.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From Jean-Franck Charlet UIAA SAFCOM President <a href=""http://www.supertopo.com/climbing/thread.php?topic_id=833631&amp;tn=0&amp;mr=0#msg840270"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">as quoted by Francis Baker on SuperTopo.com</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The half ropes are for being used alternatively one strand in a runner
  and the other in the next runner. Therefore when falling the climber
  just fall on one strand, so the UIAA has considered that one strand of
  half rope must be able to withstand once the fall of a climber of 80
  kg in fall factor 2 . But doing just a test with one fall is not very
  convenient and reproducible so the UIAA has searched for which mass, 5
  falls are equivalent to 1 fall with 80 kg. The following formula has
  been found by experimentation :</p>
  
  <p>N x M^4 = Constant</p>
  
  <p>where N is the number of falls withstand by the rope when a mass M is
  used.</p>
  
  <p>Using this formula we find that withstanding 1 fall with 80 kg is
  equivalent to withstanding 5 falls with 55 kg . ( 1 x 80^4 = 5 x 55^4 )</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the empirically determined formula we see that for survivability of the rope (and climber) in a fall weight matters in the extreme; a fourth degree exponential relationship.  Of course not every rope can be expected to rigidly follow this exact relationship but it was determined to be reliable enough to be the basis for a very important safety standard.  (See addendum.)</p>

<p>Applying the formula: a rope that will survive five 80kg UIAA drop tests, the minimum single-rope standard, will probably only survive a single 105kg UIAA-type drop (<code>5 (80/105)^4 ~= 1.68</code>) and might fail on the <em>first</em> drop of a 120kg mass (<code>5 (80/120)^4 ~= 0.99</code>).  The same rope may be anticipated to survive 22 55kg UIAA drops (<code>5 (80/55)^4 ~= 22.38</code>).  Graphically:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eChDL.png"" alt=""Simulated UIAA drop equivalents""></p>

<p>This plot includes the minimum spec for each UIAA standard, as well two more robust samples each for the Single and Half types.  While the UIAA drop test includes a margin of safety via a rigid drop mass that exerts considerably greater impact force than a human body, <a href=""http://blackdiamondequipment.com/en/qc-lab-retiring-old-ropes.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">old ropes lose a considerable portion of their strength</a>.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>It should be apparent that rope size should be matched to climber size.  This is not usually ""the way it's done"" but anything else goes against both empirical data and simple engineering principles.  Observe that the calculated margin of safety for a 100 kilogram climber on a burly 11mm rope with a 15-fall rating is about the same as that for a 60 kilogram climber leading on a single strand of mid-range (9 fall) ""Half"" rope.  This should not actually be a surprise but it probably comes as one to many anyway.  The strength of a given construction of rope is proportional to its cross-sectional area, and the area (or linear mass) of an 8.5mm Half rope is 60% that of an 11mm rope.</p>

<p>Skinny single ropes which manage to pass or exceed the UIAA fall rating do so at the expense of abrasion and likely cut resistance, so ""there is no free lunch"" in this regard.</p>

<p>Of course there are not reports of above-80kg-climbers routinely falling to their death as a result of rope breakage.  Surely this is partly because the UIAA single rope standard is practically quite high, but it is probably also because ropes are rarely tested with extreme falls.  For the paper <a href=""http://www.caves.org/section/vertical/nh/51/Hang_Em_High_Final.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hang 'Em High: How Far Can You Trust Your Belay Device?</a> the authors conducted a survey of climber's weights and their biggest lifetime falls (results on pages 8 and 10).  According to it falls approaching factor 2 are rare, as are climbers above about 100kg.  As ropes continue to be manufactured thinner and thinner, if you or your partner is on the heavy side do you really want to be the test case?</p>

<p>On the other end of the scale lightweight climbers are arguably climbing on greatly over-specified ropes much of the time.  Since Half ropes pass the same drop test as Single ropes, but with a 55kg rather than 80kg mass, such ropes appear to provide as much safety for a 55kg climber (including gear) as does a Single rope for an 80kg climber.  As stated at the beginning of this post fall rating is not the only concern, but it is unlikely that a Half rope is cut more easily by a 55kg climber than a Single is by an 80kg climber as the PSI (weight over area) is the same.  Further, as described by the Mammut representative (above) a robust Half rope like the Genesis has a much more burly sheath than a skinny single like the Serenity.</p>

<h3>Further examination of the relationship between mass and drops held</h3>

<p>In the comments <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/users/651/davidr"">DavidR</a> questioned the formula used to approximate the relationship between test mass and drops held.  Therefore I went searching for empirical data.  Unfortunately I do not have access to raw test data so I compiled a table of manufacturer ratings for every multi-certified dynamic rope that I could find.  Some ropes or data points were omitted because they were rated e.g. ""20+"" rather than a specific value.  Please be aware that to the best of my knowledge manufacturers are under no legal obligation to provide accurate drop test numbers; they are only required to meet the minimum standard, and the UIAA only provides a ""PASS"" rating to the public.  Here are the results:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1sqUD.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>On the left is the name of the rope; the next two numbers are the drop mass (80: Single, 55: Half, 40: Twin), and the number on the right is the derived exponent required match the drop test numbers.  Triple-certified ropes have three pairings on the right.</p>

<p>Two things should be quickly apparent: there is wide variation in the figures, and none of them are as high as four.  Some of the variation may come from the manufacturers rounding figures e.g. a specification of ""Falls: 6 Half, 20 Twin"" instead of ""21 Twin"" etc., but I suspect a lot of the variation is real as well.  Since none of the derived exponents exceed four, I conjecture that <strong>4</strong> in the formula given by Jean-Franck Charlet was arrived at as an upper bound; indeed this makes sense given the way it is used in the safety standard.  As a histogram the data looks like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FvTin.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The mean is 2.97 with a SD of 0.55.  </p>

<p>Using an exponent of three the simulated drops chart looks like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5HZae.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Note that on this chart the UIAA Twin and Half standards are <em>very</em> close.  While one <em>cannot</em> assume that a Twin could pass the Half test, given the large extreme spread if nothing else, there is evidence that the two standards are in fact quite close: the skinny double-certified ropes themselves:</p>

<p>The processes are identical, one just cites one specific kind of material while the other offers a more general application base. </p>

<p>In case of page deletions here is a brief summary of the information:</p>

<p>Shelters made out of cuben fabric never need re-coating. All other fabrics do have a coating which will degrade over their lifespan, mainly due to rubbing, the degrading effect of UV light from the sun and storing it wet. Shelter fabrics usually have either one of those two coatings: a silicone coating or a PU-coating (polyurethane). Tent floors usually have a PU-coating while tent flysheets usually have a silicone coating. However, a PU-coating is still used by some manufacturers on their tent flysheets. It is important to know which kind of coating has been applied to your shelter as each of these two kind of coatings need another product and solvent for re-coating. Some tents like for example those of MSR even have a different coating on each side of the fabric of the tent fly, a silicone coating on the outside and a PU-coating along the inside. If you’re not sure about the type of coating, try to contact the manufacturer.Coatings based on silicone are the easiest to renew. In case of a PU-coating it is more difficult to find the right product and solvent. </p>

<p>Ok, what do you need?</p>

<p>These are the necessary items for a silicone coating:</p>

<p>White spirit
A tube of silicone: transparent and odorless (without additives)
A silicone syringe
A clean pot or jar
An accurate weighing scale (one gram accuracy recommended)
A paint brush
A pair of protective gloves (you’ll notice I didn’t wear gloves but you should know better)</p>

<p>For a PU-coating you’ll need an urethane based product and an appropriate solvent. One can also try the expensive option like Tent Sure Tent floor sealant from Mcnett or the Nikwax variant. Otherwise the method for a PU-coating will be rather similar as I’m going to explain for a silicone coating.</p>

<p>1.Pitch the tent in a well ventilated area, preferable outdoors(on a sunny day). If weather conditions cause a good bit of dust and debris to carry in the air wait, or move indoors. While minimal dust will not affect the quality of your application large particles (like the neighbor mowing) will affect adhesion. </p>

<p>2.Clean to prepare fabric for coating. 
Make sure that fabric is completely dry before attempting to recoat.</p>

<p>3.Prepare mixture:<br>
Pour white spirits(15) and silicone(1) into a jar (weighing) the components so that there is a 15:1 ratio. As a general guideline try to using a 1.5g/1 sq. m estimate when purchasing materials. Consider each side of your tent/tarp an independent area if you are going to coat both sides.<br>
Stir until spirits and silicone are dissolved. </p>

<p>4.Paint mixture onto fabric ensuring that no runs or drops gather on the fabric. Once dried touch the surface to determine if coating is thick enough. IF necessary apply another coat. Some minor discoloration may be noticed due to operator errors. (Who can perfectly and evenly paint that kind of surface?) </p>

<p>5.After you are confident the tent is 100% dry test the coating with a spritz of water. If the water beads and runs off you have succeeded. If not repeat steps 1-5 again. </p>

","<p>Your body just doesn't have a reaction on skin contact right now.  However most people will develop a reaction after enough repeated exposure.

With regular contact, you will develop an allergy, and though it could take years, it will take a lot less if you start eating the stuff.</p>

<p>The part of poison ivy that gets you is Urushiol.  It's absorbed readily by the mucous membranes of the throat.  If you eat the berries and develop a reaction you are potentially developing a reaction all throughout your throat, etc.  If this happens, your throat will likely swell shut and... being miles from medical care... you'll die.</p>

"Is it unsafe to ride the chair lift with a backpack?","5920","","<p>I like the convenience of having a backpack when I ski.  </p>

<p>Last winter one of the lifties at the local ski hill gave me guff about my backpack, claiming that it was unsafe.  I wore the same backpack to different slopes around the Northeast US all winter, and he was the only person to ever say anything about my backpack being unsafe. </p>

<h2>Is it unsafe to ski or ride the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairlift"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">chair lift</a> with a backpack?  If so, what are the associated risks?</h2>
","<p>With a dash of common sense, and a modicum of skill I'd say packs are safe on a chairlift. One winter I skied over 100 days at Jackson Hole Mountain Resort. I wore a pack the vast majority of those days. I never once felt that any of my packs at any time were decreasing my safety or the safety of others on the lift, tram, or gondola.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.outsideonline.com/2069911/your-local-chairlift-death-trap"" rel=""noreferrer"">According to Outside Magazine</a> (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chairlift accidents happen, too, but <strong>the greatest dangers on lifts come from inexperienced skiers slipping during loading, or children and distracted riders</strong> falling to the ground. In December 2014, a woman caught her ski on a support pole at Hunter Mountain in New York and fell to her death. Colorado is one of the few states that require resorts to report injuries resulting from lift falls. In the past five years, 74 people were injured falling from lifts in that state, according to numbers provided to Outside by the Colorado Passenger Tramway Safety Board. The agency classified three of those as the lift operator’s fault.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Notice that they didn't mention, packs.</strong> I believe this is because most people who wear packs wear them responsibly. Also I think it is worthwhile to consider that in a 5 year period a busy skiing state like Colorado experienced on average ~15 falls annually. This is a very low number considering the thousands upon thousands of trips people take on ski lifts in Colorado annually. For more <a href=""http://www.safebee.com/outdoors/how-avoid-ski-lift-accidents"" rel=""noreferrer"">concrete numbers</a> (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the past 42 years — during which skiers took more than 16.3 billion chairlift rides — only 12 people have been killed, according to the National Ski Areas Association (NSAA). In fact, <strong>you’re eight times more likely to get hurt riding an elevator than hitching a lift up a mountain</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Some general tips I'd offer are:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Don't wear a big or bulky pack.</li>
<li>While seated <a href=""http://www.safebee.com/outdoors/how-avoid-ski-lift-accidents"" rel=""noreferrer"">carry the backpack on your lap</a>, with only one arm in one strap, and any waist belt unbuckled. This way you can sit fully back in the chair, ensure your pack's straps don't get caught in anything during the ride up, and it is easy to ditch the pack in the unlikely event it gets caught on something.</li>
<li>If you feel uncomfortable lower the safety bar. This is a good safety tip regardless if you are carrying a pack or not.</li>
<li>Don't carry a pack until you can get on and off the lift smoothly. If you can't do that then you don't need the extra concern.</li>
<li>Don't carry a pack if you are nervous on chairlifts. If you are already worried then you don't need extra gear to worry about.</li>
<li>If you ever feel uncomfortable mid ride you can always hook an arm over the back of the chair lift. That will dramatically reduce your already slim odds of falling off the lift. Once again this can be done if you're wearing a pack or not.</li>
<li>Follow lift operator directions. If the lift operator is giving you instructions that you feel are unreasonable exit the line and bring the issue up with the administrative team at the mountain. If the mountain has a strict no packs policy then evaluate if you want to continue to ski/snowboard there without a pack or take your business elsewhere.</li>
</ul>

<p>Like I said at the start I don't think wearing a pack is a big deal. Keep in mind you've already decided it is safe enough to sit on a chair suspended several stories in the air with strangers in possibly windy and icy conditions. Once you've made that decision, wearing a pack responsibly probably isn't going to be the straw that tips this activity into ""unsafe"" territory.</p>

","<p>One reason (and I don't know enough to suggest this is the main reason) is for identification.</p>

<p>When putting a tent up you may have a bundle of fabric that you need to set down on an uneven surface, sort and erect. Having it in black distinguishes it from the varied colours of the tent walls so you can always place your tent floor down, without having to check all the sections. The floor is the strongest, most heavily waterproofed part of the tent skin, so this also means you are less likely to end up with a damp tent from placing it upside-down on damp ground, or tears from catching branches or roots on a thin piece of tent fabric.</p>

<p>Found another reason:</p>

<p>Because the floor is manufactured using a different process to the rest of the tent, making floors that matched the tops would require more complicated processes and cost more. A constant black means any floor can be fixed to a top of the correct size.</p>

<p>What exactly is an offwidth crack?</p>

<p>What makes offwidth hard to climb? Or less subjective: What technique is required ascend an offwidth?</p>
","<p>Off width cracks are cracks that are too big to finger jam or fist jam, but too small for you to fit inside and chimney climb, so you have to come up with really awkward and very physically excerting moves to get up them, like climbing upside down (literally). </p>

Off width climbing is a lot of grunting, struggling, and trying to wedge your various body parts any where you can. You come out at the top dirty, sweating, scraped up all over and absolutely exhausted. </p>

<p>A common technique to get through off widths is to essentially use your arms and legs the way you would use your fingers in finger cracks, shove as much as you can inside the crack and then bend them to get them jammed. Other than that, the answer to how you climb offwidths is, ""However you can.""</p>

"Ski set that does both downhill and backcountry?","5794","","<p>So I know very little about skiing and have only skied about 3-4 times. I would like to ski more this winter. </p>

<p>I want to purchase a ski set, but I don't know which one to get. Here is what I wanna do, most likely I want to do more of backcountry skiing, but I also would like to do random downhill skiing as well. So basically I would like to purchase something which might not be the best but good enough for both types of skiing . </p>

<p>I read about telemark skis and they tend to do the both. Are there any other options out there? Are telemark as much fun as normal backcountry and downhill skis? </p>
","<p>In addition to telemark, there are randonnee, aka alpine touring bindings. These are basically regular alpine bindings, where the heel can be released, for climbing. When going downhill, the heel can be clipped back in, for greater support during steep alpine descents.</p>

<p>Telemark skis usually aren't super great for climbing on their own, and usually require removable skins that are put over the skis for grip when climbing. When it's time to descend, the skins are removed. Whether telemark skis are fun or not will depend on the person, however, there are plenty of people that do it and think it is a lot of fun. The telemark turn is different and needs to be learned and practiced, and it is said to be a lot better on your knees, and brutal on your quads. You are also required to grow a big bushy beard if you want to telemark.</p>

<p>Neither telemark or randonnee are as common as cross-country or alpine setups, but both are common enough that gear should be easy to aquire at reasonable prices, for example REI typically keeps both in stock.</p>

"Am I packing too much for a 2-3 day hike in the forests?","5742","","<p>I have decided that I would like to hike.</p>

<p>I have read a bit on hiking, and bought some gear and a backpack to get started. I want to start with backpacking through mostly flat forests, and later advance to mountains in Poland, like Bieszczady, and Tatry.</p>

<p>The problem is, when I put on my backpack and put on the hip and chest belts, it felt heavy and cumbersome, making me lean forward. I was wondering — am I so out of shape, or did I pack so much unnecessary things?</p>

<p>My backpack weighs about 10.5 kilograms (or about 23 pounds) without the food and water with all the equipment I would like to take on a two to three day hike. Is this too much? For a two-day hike, I would like to add at least 3.5 liters of water, and around 1 kilogram of food, bringing the total weight to about 15 kilograms (or about 33 pounds). For a three-day hike, my backpack weighs about 16 to 18 kilograms (or about 32 to 40 pounds).</p>

<p>Here's what's inside my backpack currently:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A sleeping bag</p></li>
<li><p>A tent for two people</p></li>
<li><p>A foam camping mat</p></li>

","<p>You're bringing all the right things... (the only thing I would question is why a flashlight as well as a headlamp? - though if it's just a small flashlight, no big deal- I sometimes bring a spare headlamp).
20kg's is 44 pounds and 30-40lbs is about right for a 3 day trip alone.  The only way to get the weight down is by bringing lighter (i.e. more expensive) versions of what you've already listed. </p>

<p>In terms of the pack feeling awful, some of it is indeed getting used to carrying weight over many kilometers and many days, but one of the biggest factors to your comfort is a properly fitted pack.  </p>

<p>The best thing you can do is go to an outdoor shop and see if they can help you adjust the pack you already have... sometimes it just takes some adjustments of the pack to make it fit you better.  A properly fitted pack makes ALL the difference in the world to your comfort.  That being said, you are still carrying 20kg's, good fit or no, it's a bit of weight and so you will feel it to some degree regardless. </p>

<p>Aside from pack fitting, the way you pack your pack also makes a difference.  The ideal scenario is: </p>

<p>Mid-weight stuff on the bottom of the pack; heavy stuff in the middle of the pack- so that the weight can be distributed properly within the suspension system (i.e. shoulder straps and waist belt); lightest stuff on top.  That's the general rule.  Don't spend too much time on it, but keep it in mind. </p>

<p>From what you said though, I think there's likely some adjustments to the pack you could make, or, the pack just doesn't fit you.  And, yes, you do need to get used to hiking with weight again.  :)</p>

<p>Research pack-fitting online/on youtube.  Some key things are that you shouldn't have a giant space between your back and the pack - if there's a big gap, then you might want to gently bend the metal stays (depending on what kind of pack you have) so that it fits closer to your body.  Usually a big space will cause the pack to kind of pull you backwards, and so you will tend to lean forward to compensate. </p>

"How easy is it to magnetically destroy a compass?","5730","","<p>I have quite a lot of items with built-in magnets in my backpack, like a mobile phone, an iPod or headphones. How easy is it to destroy my compass by putting it too close to these items?</p>
","<p>The only reliable information I seem to be able to find points to the fact that if you store a compass next to a strong magnet for a long period of time, it can wreck it. Additionally, it seems that some people have reported their compass becoming demagnetised when stored adjacent to something like a phone, headphones etc. though this appears less common. </p>

<p>My advice would be to keep your compass in a case when in your bag with other such items. As long as the compass itself isn't touching something else with a weak magnet in, I doubt it'd be enough to wreck it (in the short term anyway.) I tend to store my compass in a separate pocket of my rucksack in its case, and I'd say that separation is enough. I highly doubt you need to be so careful as to keep it on an entirely different side of your rucksack or anything like that.</p>

<p>For long term storage I'd be a bit more careful - my compass stays in a drawer with nothing else magnetic in it (just various other outdoors bits such as maps, paracord, etc.)</p>

<p>For the reference, the above applies to weak magnets. If for any reason you were carrying something with a very strong neodymium magnet inside I'd be a lot more careful! Sounds silly, but I do often if I'm putting out magnetic Geocaches.</p>

"Rain soaked leather jacket- how to repair?","5726","","<p>I have a genuine full grain 1.3 mm cow hide motorcycle jacket that was caught in rain. It wasn't a downpour but I was in the rain long enough for the jacket to be pretty wet, not just the surface. I have previously treated my leather with conditioner frequently, designed specifically for motorcycle jackets that boasts waterproof ability. </p>

<p>When I got home, I dried the jacket surface out with a cloth, and applied conditioner very generously. Then left it to hang dry in my closet. </p>

<p>After a few days of hanging to make sure it is completely dry, I noticed parts of the leather had stiffened/hardened. No cracks or anything like that. But rather it feels and looks like it became tighter on certain areas, and it doesn't look as smooth. (since it got tighter parts of my jacket now have a funny concave.)</p>

<p>My question is, is damage like this repairable? By applying conditioner? Or is it permanent? What is the recommended procedure to treat leather jacket after it has been soaked? </p>

<p>Ps. My leather gloves made of genuine full grain leather also has the same issue, the palm patch felt nice smooth and soft but now it looks and feels dry and hardened. Since my gloves are thinner leather, it seems a lot worse than my jacket. Can this be repaired as well? </p>

<p>Edit: I have read about this stuff but they all seem different, and I can't find a certain answer. Anything would help! If you had any experience please share! </p>
","<p>It is normal to a certain degree that wet leather, after drying, is a bit stiffer than before.</p>

<p>The effects will generally be worse</p>

<li>the faster the leather dries (so <em>don't</em> dry over a heater!)</li>

<p>Normally the stiffness should go away soon if the items are worn/used: after a short while they should be quite supple again.</p>

"""Tag line""/""pull cord"" for multipitch trad: what kind and when needed?","5666","","<p>I normally climb with a single 10 mm x 60 m rope. On some multipitch trad climbs, I don't expect to have to rappel off, but I might have to in an emergency. Many people carry a special-purpose 6 mm rope for this purpose, referred to as a ""tag line"" or ""pull cord."" They can then do a full 60 m single-strand rappel and use the thin rope to pull down the climbing rope after them after each rap.</p>

<p>It seems as though there is probably not a single rule as to what to bring: no tag line, a tag line, or a second climbing rope that you could lead on. There should be some decision-making process based on knowledge of the route. I'm not very experienced at multipitch.</p>

<p>Folks who are more experienced, <strong>what factors would you look at?</strong> For example, if there are three pitches, each more than 30 m, do you say something like this to yourself? -- ""If I split each pitch in half and rap off with a single rope, then that means leaving gear behind in six places, and I would run out of gear before I get to the bottom.""</p>

<p>I guess the argument for bringing a second real climbing rope would be that otherwise if you pull on the tag line and it gets stuck, you're in real trouble. However, canyoneers do this regularly.</p>

<p>You can get 6 mm spectra rope, which is lighter than nylon but expensive and just as bulky. <a href=""http://www.espritropes.com/water.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">Polypropylene ropes</a> are almost as light as spectra, but I haven't been able to find a dealer and don't know how the cost compares with spectra.</p>
","<p>In the absence of someone more experienced commenting, here is my take:</p>

<p>This topic has been discussed on various climbing forums, but a strong consensus has yet to emerge in the US.  (Outside the US, you are probably climbing on doubles, and so the question doesn’t arise.)  I do sense an increased appreciation for climbing on doubles, and using a thin tag line does have its risks.  I also suspect that a tag line made more sense when 10mm or thicker ropes were the standard compared to modern skinny ropes.  <strong>Thus, for someone with less experience I would recommend using a half rope instead of a thin static line.</strong>  If you are going to use a tag line, what follows is an overview of factors to consider.</p>

<p>First, even though you already have a single rope, consider whether your routes might be better suited for a 70m rope or for double rope technique.  The first option might eliminate the need for a second rope entirely, and the second provides additional safety benefits.  You’ll see more of a benefit using doubles on long multipitch routes.</p>

<p>A tag line, particularly a static line, is best suited for purely vertical routes (e.g. Yosemite big walls).  The lack of stretch in a static line will aid in hauling; if you are climbing close to your limit, you may want to use a tag line to haul your pack.  Some also prefer using a thick (10+mm and durable) single rope with a static (more durable, potentially less likely to snag) tag line in environments where the rock is particularly hard on ropes, e.g. desert sandstone.  Somewhat in opposition to this are those who feel the best approach to rope-eating cracks is to <strong>ensure the second rope is suitable for leading on, so that when a rope does get caught it can still be retrieved without an effective free-solo</strong>.</p>

<p>Many people report lines 6mm or narrower are especially prone to tangling, kinks, and other rope management issues.  (Narrow lines are also hard on your hands, whether pulling the rope after a rappel or during hauling.) One recommendation is to knot such lines at regular intervals and hang the knots on a carabiner as an alternative to flaking the line.  Another is to use a stuff sack as a feeder bag rather than throwing it down and dealing with the resulting tangles.  Thicker lines will help with this but reduce the weight benefit.  Once you reach the 7-8mm range you might as well use a half rope; consider the 7.8mm Edelrid Apus or the 7.3mm Beale Gully.</p>

<p>A more wandering route presents a case where half ropes would provide a benefit in reducing rope drag. <strong>A route known for sharp edges or to be prone to rockfall presents a good argument for the insurance of a second rope.</strong>  Consider also your retreat; a long series of rappels at the end of the day or due to an incoming thunderstorm will be much easier with double ropes.  If you are attempting multiple rappels with odd-sized ropes, having to pull the heavier rope back up each time to feed it through the anchor means extra effort expended (refer to [3] below); doubles make this a non-issue.</p>

<p>Regarding leaving gear behind, I have difficulty imagining situations where this would be considered as anything other than an emergency option.  (Obviously this does not include the occasional bit of webbing and rappel rings or “leaver biners”.)  Your options for building a suitable rappel anchor halfway down a pitch may be very limited, and cams are not exactly cheap.</p>

<p>As to materials, <a href=""http://www.rockandice.com/lates-news/spectra-versus-nylon"">Spectra and Dyneema</a> have low melting points, rendering them vulnerable to friction and unsuitable for rappelling.  They are also slicker than nylon; knots tied in them can fail at lower forces than expected (the core separates and pulls through the sheath).  For this reason a triple fisherman’s bend is recommended instead of the traditional double fisherman’s bend.  They are also less durable over time; repeated bending cycles can soon reduce their strength below comparable nylon alternatives.</p>

<p>Polypropylene floats, and that’s probably its main benefit.  It’s weaker than nylon, not as durable, and also has a low melting point. The ropes you linked have a polyester sheath in order to add strength and block UV.  Personally I would avoid it, especially in an environment that would abrade the sheath.</p>

<p>Now, some cautionary bits.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If using a static tag line, cut it a bit longer than your lead line to account for stretch (e.g. 65m rather than 60m.)</p></li>
<li><p>If rappelling on only a single line, use a carabiner block (tied on the thicker line) rather than assuming the knot won’t be able to pass through the anchor.  (It can and has.)</p></li>
<li><p>If rappelling on both lines, the thinner line will feed through the rappel device faster.  Feeding the thicker line through the anchor will mitigate this.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tie stopper knots and back up your rappel.</strong></p></li>
</ol>

"If I'm caught in lightning above tree-line, what should I do?","5658","","<p>We all know the general lightning guidelines, but what if I am above tree-line and caught in a freak lightning storm. Is it better to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Run like mad to toward the trees </li>
<li>Lie flat, and find religion  </li>
<li>Find any imperfection in my surroundings (boulders, creek-bed) and
try to wedge myself between / below it.</li>
</ol>
","<p>Okay - I found that both my Langmuir (Mountaincraft and Leadership) and my Mountaineers (Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills) have pretty good advice about lightning. I would advise anyone planning on heading out into the hills to read both of these excellent books - Langmuir is <em>the</em> book for British Mountain Leader Training, and the Mountaineers covers a lot extra information for activities over in North America.</p>

<p>I don't think being away from the treeline is particular problematic (unless you are the only thing on a very flat piece of ground).</p>

<p>As long as you are not on the top of a ridge/hill, then there is a safe ""shadow zone"" on the side of the hill - I think something of the order of 2/3 of the way between the hilltop and its base. The only thing is - you should sit on top of a plastic sheet or your backpack to prevent picking up stray eddy currents from the ground.</p>

<p><strong>From Langmuir</strong> (Mountaincraft and Leadership, 3rd Edition):</p>

<p>You can get a shadow from a 7m or taller cliff where the safe zone is between 3m from the base out to the height of the cliff - this means standing 5m from a 7m cliff should reduce your chance of a lightning strike (note - <strong>reduce</strong> - there is still a chance you can get hit, there is no 0%). There is a diagram on page 227 of 3rd Edition - I can't find one to link to, unfortunately. He doesn't say how steep the cliff should be, though.</p>

<p>If you enter a cave for shelter (or dive under a boulder) - you must have at least 3m head room (so - 5m total) and 1m to either side.</p>

<p><strong>From The Mountaineers</strong> (Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills, 6th Edition):</p>

<p>These guys are pretty clear:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If thunderstorms are forecast:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Do not camp or climb in a narrow valley or gully</li>
  <li>Do not plan to climb or hike in high, exposed areas</li>
  <li>Watch small cumulus clouds for strong, upward growth</li>
  <li>Keep track of weather reports</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>If you spot a thunderstorm:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Get away from water</li>
  <li>Seek low ground in an open valley or meadow</li>
  <li>Move immediately if your hair stands on end</li>
  <li>Do not stand under trees, especially in open areas</li>
  <li>Do not remain near metal or graphite equipment</li>
  <li>Insulate yourself from the ground with your pack or a foam mat</li>

<p>I have been really cold a few times. It seems to me that getting warm again was more painful then the getting cold.  Hypothermia has nothing on the ordeal of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aron_Ralston"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Aron Ralston,</a> and wandering around in the dark or a blizzard seems like a good way to find a very painful end.  </p>

<p>So if I am hunkered down, waiting for the Sun to come out, what should I expect to feel if I won't be seeing the Sun again? </p>
","<p>It's not that bad. </p>

<p>First of all, distinguish between hypothermia and frostbite.  The latter is when your flesh actually freezes.  Water crystals do a lot of damage.  It is extremely painful when thawing.  </p>

<p>If you get cold enough for numbness to set in, that too will be painful on warming.</p>

<p>Hypothermia, not so much.</p>

<p>First symptoms:  The 'umbles:  Stumble, Fumble, Mumble.  Your fine motor coordination goes.  Note:  Mumbling may be just caused by cold cheeks and lips.  Mumbling in this case is much more like someone who has had too much booze.</p>

<p>Involuntary shivering.  If you can force yourself to stop with an act of will, you are still ok.  In danger, but ok.</p>

<p>Sometime in here you stop being rational.  </p>

<p>Once you stop shivering you are in big trouble.  Muscles are too cold to work, which means they have stopped generating much heat.  Your body temp drops really fast now.</p>

<p>Consciousness fades.</p>

<p>As your core cools, heartbeat gets irregular, your lungs start filling (pulmonary edema) and death results.</p>

<p>The shivering phase is unpleasant, but not painful.</p>

<p>Note that in my outdoor experience I've seen mild to moderate (uncontrolable shivering) on several occasions.  </p>

<p><strong>The symptoms do not always show up in the same order.</strong></p>

<p>Sometimes this may be that no one (including the victim) noticed.  Sometimes they just don't happen that way.  Some may be the complications of low blood sugar, dehydration, exhaustion.</p>

<p>Note that hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) will also show the 'umbles and the irrationality.  Dehydration also has similar onset.  Both make hypothermia more likely, the first because there is less fuel to create heat, the second because the circulation system is sluggish and can't move glucose, O2, and heat around as effectively.</p>

<p>In all three cases treatment for early stages:  sugar and hot drinks, </p>

<p>For hypothermia: dry/more clothing, shelter from wind, more movement if conscious.</p>

<p>It does NOT have to be below freezing to die from hypothermia.  You can die of hypothermia in 70 degree water.  Takes hours.  In 50 degree water far less.  In 35 degree water you aren't able to do much for yourself after about 20 minutes.  Unconsciousness is another 20 minutes or so.</p>

<p>For non-water sports, the dangerous temps are around freezing.  It's hard to stay dry at those temps.  But being immobile on mountain ridge at 50 F in a storm can kill you with hypothermia.</p>

<p>Wind makes it worse.  It keeps moving the warm air next to your skin away.<br>
Wet makes it worse.  Water evaporates and cools.  It also reduces the effectiveness of insulation.  The combination is deadly.</p>

<p>Small people (children, women) are more susceptible than larger.<br>
Skinny people are more susceptible than fat people.</p>

<p>In both cases, the core is closer to the surface.</p>

<p>If you get to the cesation of shivering, you have a life threatening situation.  If you are far from help the victim is very likely to die.  </p>

<p><strong>Don't let it get that far.</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Training:  Know the symptoms.  Teach the symptoms.  Teach the responses.  There is merit in going out on a cold windy day, having people peal down then put on a soaking wet t-shirt.  Do this near a heated building obviously.  Talk about the symptoms as they occur.  When someone can't stop shivering, go inside.  Have hot drinks and a roaring fire handy.  </p></li>
<li><p>Buddy system.  Pair everyone up.  Practice calling out ""Buddy Check"" and have people talk to their buddy.  Since 'umbles are usually first this is a quick check.</p></li>
<li><p>More experienced personelle double check.  If hiking, the easy way to do this, is to step off the trail and look at faces as they go by.  Fall in and chat to any zombies.  Do this from the start of the trip to recognize the differences.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep people hydrated.  Lots of people won't drink enough if it's just water with no flavour.  Make sure they drink.  Train them to notice their pea color.  Colourless to light yellow.  No problem. Dark yellow to orange.  Get them to drink.  (Some foods and vitamins will darken your urine.)</p></li>
<li><p>Keep people fed.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Every case of hypothermia I've seen has been near the end of the day when people were running on empty.  As  leader on day hikes, I always carried a couple of bread and honey sandwiches (easy fuel) If I didn't use them, I took them for lunch the next day.  Candy bars work well too.  Eatmores and snickers are hard to eat when cold.  The mini bars available at Halloween are easier to eat, and easy to share.</p>

"Are there any techniques for starting and maintaining a fire in snow?","5556","","<p>What are the techniques for starting and maintaining a fire in a survival situation when snow is present?</p>

<p>I would like to know if there are any known techniques for starting and maintaining a fire in the wild for survival reasons when there is snow on the ground.</p>

<p>Does the amount of snow alter the technique that is required?</p>
","<p>Aside from what is mentioned in the answers to <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/8204/how-to-light-a-fire-with-wet-firewood/8205#8205"">this</a> question (<a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/8204/how-to-light-a-fire-with-wet-firewood/8205#8205"">How to light a fire with wet firewood?</a>) the things you need to be concerned about in winter are the cold, frozen wood, and your fire being extinguished by snow.</p>

<p>On winter camps one story that always went around was one of a man who died because after he built his fire and was just barely getting it going, a sluff of snow fell from the tree he was taking shelter under and extinguished it. By the time he had built it back up again, his hands were too frozen to strike a match. So make sure you're building your fire away from anything that can extinguish it. </p>

<p>As far as preparing your fire, you don't have to worry too much about how much snow is beneath it as long as it is somewhat packed down and you have a base of limbs or logs. The best thing to do is lay a base of logs on the snow and build your fire on top of that, then your tinder is protected from the melting snow, which to be frank doesn't really melt that fast even after your fire gets going. When I was a kid we started a huge bonfire on a mountain lake once because we thought it'd be cool to watch it burn through the ice and get extinguished in the lake. The once 20ft flame fire simply burnt out after a <em>long</em> time and didn't even make a dent in the ice, it just made the surface wet and slick. </p>

<p>Frozen wood can take even longer to burn than wet wood can, because you have to thaw it out first, so select your wood by taking dead branches high off the ground without any snow on them, or actually fall a dead tree and take the wood from the top and chop your wood really fine to get the dry stuff from the centre. </p>

<p>My favourite winter fire is made using four-foot logs between two and four inches in diameter. I set two larger logs parallel on the ground, then start laying the other logs across them until I have a 4ft x 4ft grill. Take a few of the logs out of the middle to start the fire with a typical tipi fire, then once it starts burning and you get few coals, replace the logs. <strong>This type of fire has several advantages:</strong> </p>

<p><strong>First</strong>, you don't have to cut as much wood, the logs are quick and easy to cut because they're skinny, and you don't have to chop any. You simply cut small deadfall trees, or use large branches. In my part of the world we have lots of lodgepole pines, which choke the sun out to the forest floor and kill off a lot of smaller trees, so there's an endless supply of smaller deadfall, perfect for firewood. </p>

<p><strong>Second</strong>, after you get a good bed of coals, this fire becomes the perfect fire for warming you up and drying things out, because it's a low-flame, high-heat type of fire. Your logs will burn through in the middle and fall into the coals, when they do, simply tuck the fallen logs under the others and replace them with new ones on top. You will quickly have a 16 square-foot bed of hot coals covered by a grill of skinny logs with very little flame. It's also excellent for cooking because you have the same amount of area to put pans and kettles (just make sure they're sitting on the new logs). </p>

<p><strong>Third,</strong> You can use frozen logs once the fire gets going. When you're replacing logs, you can throw icy frozen solid logs into your grill and they will quickly thaw out and start to burn. </p>

<p>As an aside, one thing I always carry with me now in the winter is white gas or starter fluid to start my winter fires if it's taking too long to do so with tinder. In emergent situations, you may not have the ability to prepare a proper fire as is illustrated in the frozen-hands story I shared above. But with lighter fluid, you don't need much dexterity to squirt that on and throw a match at it. </p>

"Is it safe to drink snow?","5548","","<p>If it snows, is it safe to drink the water when it melts? What sickness can I get from snow? I am in Europe and would like to know for here, but other places would be interesting too.</p>
","<p>If it is clean, fresh snow, it is safe to drink. This is basically drinking rain water. It hasn't had time to pick up pollutants when it is newly fallen. I live in New England, and kids do this all the time. You get taught early to only do this with white snow.</p>

<p>Make sure that the snow is actually clean: the longer it sits, and the more urbanized an area is, the more likely it is to be dirty and to have picked up pollutants. If it's brown or gray snow beside a road or path, or yellow snow where an animal urinated, it's no longer drinkable.</p>

<p>As far as what sickness you can get, it will depend on what's in the snow. With yellow snow, I'd assume you could get the diseases you'd usually get from drinking water with animal waste. If it's beside a road, you'd be ingesting heavy metals and chemicals found in car exhaust. </p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>:
In response to the comments as to the general safety of drinking rainwater, </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.harvesth2o.com/rainwater_safe.shtml#.Vo7e0pXluAY"">http://www.harvesth2o.com/rainwater_safe.shtml#.Vo7e0pXluAY</a> - This is from a person who tested their own cistern (a holder for rainwater), and includes no information on the cistern's cleanliness, or whether it is open to the air and debris. Even so, the water was purer than well water or tap water the tester checked in New Mexico. The only significant pollutant was bacteria, which tend to grow when you store water.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/gdwqrevision/rainwater.pdf"">http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/gdwqrevision/rainwater.pdf</a> - In the first sentence WHO simply assumes rainwater is drinkable straight from the sky, and the rest of the article is about storing and purifying after storage. If contamination directly from the sky was a major concern, it is reasonable to expect WHO to mention it when discussing rainwater harvesting.</p>

<p>And anecdotally, when I've lived places where drinking rainwater was the norm, the only concern was bacteria from the cistern, not airborn pollutants.</p>

"Is a smartphone or dedicated gps receiver better for navigation in the desert?","5547","","<p>For most backcountry navigation I use a topo map and compass when necessary. Generally I'm following known trails and combined with some basic awareness of cardinal direction and land features I don't really need electronics.</p>

<p>This fall, I'm going to a large desert that's fairly off the beaten track with little in the way of established trails. There are some features I'd like to be dead-accurate on (water sources, primarily) so that when I find them I'll be able to accurately record their position for future use. </p>

<p>I'm trying to decide between my phone, a Samsung Galaxy S5, or a dedicated GPS receiver (Garmin, etc). GPS receivers seem a bit more bullet proof, seem to have a more stable operating system, and as a dedicated device probably have better battery life.</p>

<p><strong>What would be the main reasons why someone would pick one versus the other?</strong></p>

<p>Also, I have a 16K mAh Anker battery, but given the weight (~11oz) I'd prefer to not lug it around if possible.</p>
","<p>Most GPS receivers in phones work not nearly as good as stand-alone GPS devices. Usually, one wouldn't notice this because phones use assisted GPS where they get the orbital data and/or almanac of the GPS satellites as well as the exact time from the GSM network. Also, they have an approximate position of the device.
Without that data, phones are very slow getting the position. Usually it works ok if there is still AGPS data downloaded, but that data goes stale after a few days.</p>

<p>Downloading the full almanac data from one satellite takes 12.5minutes. </p>

<p>Some phones I used instantly forgot the data sent by the satellites after closing the app using GPS. This means another 12min wait on the next usage. </p>

<p>Standalone devices are optimized for that situation. While some of them can also use AGPS data, they are expected to work without it. No such device will, for example, ""forget"" the almanac and expect it to be downloaded from the internet.</p>

<p>I have a fairly recent Sony Xperia Z3 phone at the moment which can use Glonass satellites in addition to GPS but without Internet, a ~5 year old i-Blue 747A+ beats it by far. Faster fixes and more accurate position.
If you insist on using your phone (or want it as a backup) I suggest you buy a bluetooth GPS tracker/mouse and use that with your phone. On Android, there are apps to use the GPS position via Bluetooth instead of the built in receiver.</p>

<p>You can test how well your Galaxy S5 works by downloading the app <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eclipsim.gpsstatus2&amp;hl=de"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GPS Status &amp; Toolbox</a>, disable all data connections (Wifi and mobile), reset the AGPS data using that app, restart the phone and then get the GPS position. You will notice that it is very slow. After the phone got a first fix, try to close all apps using GPS, wait a few minutes and try to get the position again. Do the same but restart the phone.
This should give you a realistic estimation of how well your phone will serve you in the desert.</p>

"Any reason to carry a mug outside of the backpack?","5489","","<p>We all know this typical Hollywood hiking backpack with an attached sleeping bag and a dangling camping mug. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/baDgsm.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/baDgsm.jpg"" alt=""hiking""></a></p>

<p>As I currently build a custom backpack, I wondered if there is any good reason to leave the mug outside of your backpack?</p>
","<p>A mug outside the backpack is far <strong>easier to reach</strong>.</p>

<p>In some areas, you will pass streams very often.  During my first ever backpacking trip, with a group of Swedish people hiking Kaisepakte – Pessiskåtan – Lapporten – Tältlägret – Abisko in September 2005, most people had a mug hanging outside so that they could reach it immediately.  Every 5 minutes or so, we would cross a stream and people would drink a few draughts.  I believe some of them did not bother to carry a water bottle at all, as we were probably never more than 500 metre from a stream during this hike.</p>

<p>In fact, Swedish mugs often have a hole specifically for attaching the mug outside the backpack:</p>

<p>I imagine it's considerably less useful in desert areas or in areas where it is essential to filter water before drinking.</p>

<p>I can't think of any good reason to leave the sleeping bag outside though, unless there is no space inside.</p>

<p>(Incidentally, when I for the first time saw the advice that one is not supposed to camp near water sources, I was somewhat confused, for taking this rule literally would render large areas of the Scandinavian mountains off-limits for camping)</p>

"Any tips to reduce chance that I have to get up and pee in the night (not counting dehydration, of course)","5478","","<p>Well, here's the situation. You're on an outdoor trip in winter. It's cold outside and after a long day all you want to do is crawl into your warm sleeping bag and not get out of it until the next morning. Unfortunately, shortly after reaching the warmth of your tent, you feel the urge to pee and have to get up and out again.</p>

<p>The obvious solution to just pee right before you go to bed doesn't seem to help as somehow the act of warming up in the sleeping bag seems to encourage a second round of peeing. </p>

<p>It's ok in summer, but in winter it REALLY sucks, especially if you're traveling light so you only have your ski boots to get into and your tent is small and cramped anyway...</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>
","<p>Three things</p>

<ul>
<li>pee right before you go to sleep. I know it seems obvious, but people forget</li>
<li>keep warm and sleep well. You can wake up just bursting to pee in the morning, or you can wake up kinda needing to pee at 3am and you can't get back to sleep. The sounder you sleep the more likely you can sleep through kinda needing to pee</li>
<li>don't drink a LOT of liquid in the evening. Don't deprive yourself, but if you chug back a litre of something just because you like the taste of it, you know where that litre will end up :-)</li>
</ul>

<p>In my opinion, a pee jar is a terrible idea, especially with kids. It would just lead to pee all over the tent one way or another. Not wanting to go out in the cold to pee is a good motivator and if you don't get up in the night at home, you shouldn't have to get up in the night when you're camping.</p>

"What are some good tips and techniques for packing a backpack?","5474","","<p>How do I pack a backpack to prevent injury to my back and keep it comfortable while hiking?</p>
","<p>The key to keeping your back happy is to drive as much pack weight to your hips as possible.  A side note on weight is that the lighter your pack overall, the happier your back.</p>

<p>A lot of the packing order depends on your particular pack, but in general, the bottom of a pack is below your hips.  Therefore, it is best to put something big and light in the bottom.  A fleece is one idea, or your sleeping bag (if it's down, might be less great if synthetic due to the amount of crushing that will happen).</p>

<p>Now that we have the level of stuff above your hips, heavy things go next, right against your back.  I like to put my food bag on one side and the tent on the other.  Down the middle, cooking gear, maps, books, etc.</p>

<p>If there is room left away from your back, stuff your sleeping pad and random clothes.</p>

<p>On the top all this stuff, put whatever light items you have left (i.e. repair kits, first aid kit, rain jacket).</p>

<p>The key to this idea is that your heavy things are silo-like, i.e. tightly packed stuff sacks.  That way their weight will be driven to your hips, and anything stacked on them will also drive weight to your hips.  The ""looser"" your packing job, the less efficiently this will happen.</p>

"Should one attempt to rescue a stranger from a crevasse or wait for mountain rescue?","5448","","<p>Imagine the situation. You are somewhere in the montblanc massif crossing a glacier and you come across a pair of climbers. You/ I are well trained in crevasse rescue, but are not a certified guide. </p>

<p>One of the pair has fallen into a crevasse but is conscious, and is being supported by his partner in self arrest. The victim is unable to climb out.</p>

<p>You call mountain rescue and they say they will be there in 30 mins. <strong>Should you attempt to hoist the victim out with a 3:1 system or just wait for the pros?</strong></p>

<p>At the very least, I would attempt to build an anchor to take the load off the self arresting climber. Assume sufficient but basic equipment: prussics, karabiners, axes, screws, maybe a petzl micro traxion...</p>

<p>Please qualify answers with experience or repeatable references. No personal opinions.</p>
","<p>Yes, you absolutely should rescue the climber when the situation allows.</p>

<p>The reason that matters most is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_trauma"" rel=""noreferrer"">suspension trauma</a>: Prolonged motionless hanging in a harness can lead to loss of consciousness and eventually even death. Of course you say the victim is conscious, so he might be able to move or even install a foot-loop to transition weight to his legs. You also state that he can't climb out, so it is likely he is injured so he might not be able to do this. In any case, even if he is not in immediate danger for suspension trauma, free hanging in a crevasse is not a comfortable position to be in (personal experience). So assess the situation together with the climber in the crevasse and take a decision.</p>

<p>I am not saying you need to get him out in every situation, but if the situation permits it, you should. So as usual contact the victim to evaluate his condition and position. If he is unhurt, able to get weight off the harness, but for some reason can't ascend and rescue is hard to do due to an immense snow lip at the crevasse border - by all means wait for the professional rescuers. They have material like tripods to solve such a situation.</p>

<p>There might even be a legal argument about denial of assistance if the victim comes to harm due to the prolonged stay in the crevasse and it can be proven, that you were able to help but didn't. However I doubt this can happen unless you are a professional yourself. Still this is also morally relevant: Do you want to be in the situation where you need to ask yourself the question: What if?</p>

<p>As I raised legalities I assume the following argument comes up: But what if the climber is injured during rescue?<br>
The premise is that the climber is conscious. So you can communicate during the entire rescue and you should. Then the risk is minimal.</p>

<p>Addendum:<br>
I specifically didn't go into details of the rescue, as that was specifically not what the question asked: They are experienced in crevasse rescue. So when I say you should help when applicable, I obviously mean to the extent that makes sense given the situation (I specifically said so) and under the number one principle of any rescue: <em>Keep yourself safe</em>.</p>

<p>I have read over the answers to ""<a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/464/what-are-some-proven-methods-of-training-for-week-long-backpacking-trips-in-high"">What are some proven methods of training for week long backpacking trips at high altitude?</a>"", which covers coming to Colorado for a hiking trip across several 14-ers.

<li>Most questions relating to altitude sickness agree that the best way to acclimate yourself is to go to high altitude regularly. Given that this is not an option, is there any way to mitigate the risks somewhat? </li>
<li>If she climbs the mountain the day after she arrives, will this make much of a difference?</li>
</ul>
","<p>The other answers already gave lots of information about altitude adaption, so I will focus on one certain point:</p>

<p>AMS (acute mountain sickness) evolves when staying at high altitudes. It is a pathologic disease with potential severe consequences. This should not be mixed up with the immediate influences of high altitude on the body like decrease of physical performance, fast breathing or even headaches. </p>

<p>These symptoms can be very troublesome and prevent a successful ascent, but as long as you descent the same day, they will vanish. So it is very important to take the possibility of a need to turn back on the ascent into account when planning. But going fast to high altitude does not put you at risk for AMS and thus long term medical problems.</p>

<p>I live at 600m altitude (~2000 feet) and climbed mountains of up to 4200m (14000 feet) several times. In my case I always did an ascent to a mountain cabin the first day and climbed the peak the next, so there was a certain ""acclimatisation"". I never had any headaches, just the normal decreased physical performance. A friend of mine ones made a trip from 600m (2000 feet) by train to 1500m (5000feet) and then an ascent to 4400m (&lt;15000 feet) in one day. He had a nasty head ache when reaching the summit, but absolutely manageable, and by the time he was home he was fine. The next day we went multipitch climbing.</p>

<p>So in my opinion it is perfectly save to do day trips to high-altitudes as long as one can turn back when experiencing problems. Of course this is all considering a healthy and fit person, if one has a history of heart or lung problems, it is obvious this does not apply.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Most questions relating to altitude sickness agree that the best way to acclimate yourself is to go to high altitude regularly. Given that this is not an option, is there any way to mitigate the risks somewhat?</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>While the above answers the other questions, I want to address the implication in this question:<br>
I understand the statement put in the question about acclimatisation the following way: By going to high altitudes many times (but not staying up high) you build a lasting resistance against high altitude sickness. This is <strong>not</strong> the case.  </p>

<p>How long the effects of high altitude acclimatisation after getting back down to low altitudes lasts is an ongoing subject in research and kind of controversial. But many findings suggest, that you loose the effects of acclimatisation to high altitude faster than you build them up.  </p>

<p>Of course when going to high altitudes to do mountaineering often you will train some resistance to the symptoms described above as with every other training in sports. But this is no substitution for true acclimatisation and wears off if not trained, like everything else.  </p>

<p>So you practically have to live in high altitude to really be acclimatised, not just go there regularly.</p>

<h2>Keeping feet dry</h2>

<ol>
<li>While hiking, use gaitors that come above your socks and divert water away from the wicking material.</li>
<li>Keep your boots well oiled, using a product like Nikwax, or minkoil. This keeps the leather from absorbing water as much. </li>
<li>In normal conditions (not marsh hiking) use baking soda or similar powder to absorb the natural sweat from your feet.</li>
<li>There are impermeable ""bags"" you can put over you foot while wearing a liner sock, then put your foot into a medium weight sock. The bag keeps out water, but also keeps in sweat. 
<ul>
<li>Note that once the humidity within the bag reaches 100% your foot will stop sweating.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h2>Getting feet dry, after being wet.</h2>

<ol>
<li>Carry extra shoes in any backcountry travel which breath well, and are light.
<ul>
<li>Keep them totally dry through the day in a bag.</li>
<li>My favorite are crocs, because they are simple, light, and cannot absorb water.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Keep one pair of socks for sleeping, and nothing else. </p>

<ul>
<li>The best material for these are full synthetic, not wool or cotton, since the polyester cannot absorb water.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Provide enough time for your feet to completely dry out each night.</p>

<ul>
<li>Don't go tromping around camp in your ""dry"" socks, they are for the tent and sleeping bag  only.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h2>Drying Wet Socks</h2>

<ol>
<li>Place them around your neck, or over your chest and they will be dry in the moring. 
<ul>
<li>If you are a heavy sweater wear a silk weight shirt and pants to absorb and wick moisture, or place socks on top of sleeping bag. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hang socks from ""in tent"" drying line if the air temperature is high and humidity is low.
<ul>
<li>If not the socks will not dry at all.</li>

"In what conditions is a four-season tent needed?","5423","","<p>Growing up hiking the southern Appalachians, I've never actually needed a four season tent.  However we are starting to look at hikes around the country where the temperatures and conditions get worse in the winter.  What's a good guideline for knowing when to bring the four season tent instead of the three?</p>
","<p>I think there are two primary distinctions between ""4 season"" (winter-capable) and ""3 season"" tents: Air flow and room.</p>

<p>In a 3 season tent, you generally want good ventilation and you pretty much leave it at that.  You have to consider this issue a lot more in a winter tent.  The difference is that in a winter tent the water vapor in your breath will condense and eventually freeze.  This brings up a set of issues that just don't exist when ice can't magically form from nothing inside the tent.  Winter tents can generally be shut pretty tight, but not completely tight.  You need some outside air exchange, but it needs to be possible to limit and control this.</p>

<p>The other issue is one of space.  I have a tiny 3 season tent that is just enough for me to lie down in.  That's great because it's light and small and can be pitched in many more places that would be out of the question for a tent with a larger footprint.  However, the downside of this is there is very little room inside.  Most of the time, it's not that big a deal to have to open the tent to sit up.  However in winter you really want to be able to do a few basic things inside the tent, like get fully dressed in winter gear.</p>

<p>Just out of curiosity to see what the issues really were, I took my little 3 season tent on a single overnight in the middle of winter.  I knew there were going to be some un-comforts.  The point was to understand them better.  It was -5&deg;F in the morning, so this was a decent test.  Condensed and frozen breath wasn't that much of a issue because the tent is reasonably well ventilated even with all the rain covers in place.  However, getting up and going in the morning was really awkward.  When it's that cold you really don't want to get out of your sleeping bag to get dressed at all, and you really don't want to open the tent to do it.  I managed it, but it took a lot of squirming around and significantly more time than if I could have sat up.  Having a vestibule for boots that is accessible from inside would have been really nice.</p>

<p>On a separate note, I also learned that a single thermal foam pad under the sleeping bag when the snow is that cold isn't enough.  The cold manages to get thru to you because the sleeping bag (was a nice down bag) is compressed where you are lying on it.  Enough body warmth gets thru the compressed foam pad at pressure points that it re-forms the snow there a little and makes things quite more lumpy by morning than they were in the evening.</p>

","<p>The answer is it depends. <a href=""https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/publicroads/03jul/06.cfm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Highway noise</a> is typically 70-80 dB at 15 m. To a first order approximation, sound waves obey the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">inverse square law</a> where there is a 6 dB drop every doubling of the distance. This means a sound source that has a level of 72 dB at 15 m would have a level of 0 dB at 60 km. While <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_threshold_of_hearing"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">absolute threshold</a> is typically described as 0 dB, highway noise probably becomes imperceptible from the forest background noise at 30 dB, or about 3.8 km from the highway under ideal conditions.</p>

<p>The first order approximation is not very good. This <a href=""http://www.mne.psu.edu/lamancusa/me458/10_osp.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">book chapter</a> seems to touch on the key factors meteorological conditions (e.g., temperature and humidity), terrain (e.g., hills and what is on the ground) and obstructions that will influence the propagation of the sound. Some of these things cause sound to get attenuated quicker while others can cause it to propagate further (e.g., a forest can act as a wave guide). If the <a href=""https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environMent/noise/regulations_and_guidance/polguide/polguide05.cfm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">vegatation</a> is thick enough, it can provide substantial attenuation (10 dB per 61 m). Further, the inverse square law is for point sources and, as the linked chapter points out, highway noise is potentially better modeled as multiple point sources 9or maybe even a line source if there is lots of traffic). As I said, the answer depends.</p>

"What's the problem with electrolyte imbalance and how do I mitigate it?","5333","","<p>In the past week I've seen two answers mentioning electrolytes; one about the <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/a/3924/566"">grand canyon</a> and one in an answer on a question that was actually about wildlife, but where other desert dangers were described <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/a/3918/566"">as well</a>.</p>

<p>In the context of outdoor sports, what are electrolytes, why do I need them and where do I get them from?  The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolyte"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia article</a> describes that <em>this includes most soluble salts, acids, and bases</em>.  So is it simply a matter of eating salted food to compensate for the salt lost by sweat (for example, eating salted nuts), or are the problem and solution more subtle than that?</p>

<p><a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/a/3918/566"">This answer</a> mentions <em>Gatorade</em>, which appears to be a brand for commercial sports-themed beverages.  The sport drinks I've tried in the past I found very distasteful, moreso the ones in powdered form.  Do I need those, really, or will other food do, too?</p>
","<p>There are two types of water-based concerns while doing strenuous activity in the desert: <em>dehydration</em> and <em>hyponatremia</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Dehydration</strong> occurs when your body is not getting enough water, and is the most common. Symptoms include irritability, headache, lack of energy, bright yellow/orange and infrequent urine. You lose water while you sweat, but in hot climates you don't necessarily notice since it evaporates so readily. Along with that water, you also lose electrolytes (salts and minerals) that your body needs. Lose too much of those, and drink too much water without replacing them, and you tip the balance in the direction of hyponatremia.</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyponatremia"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>Hyponatremia</strong></a>  (which the questions linked allude to) is a very serious condition on the other end of the scale that occurs when one drinks too much water without replacing the salts sweated out. It is affecting more and more people exerting themselves in hot climates due to our increasingly ""sodium free!"" diets.</p>

<p>Your body needs salt to function, and as you sweat, you lose that salt (and other nutrients) which water alone will not replace. Usually this isn't a big issue, and the salts get replaced with meals etc. But if you are sweating a lot and drinking <em>anything</em> (water or sports beverages) to excess, hyponatremia can set in.</p>

<p><em>Symptoms of hyponatremia</em> include headache, nausia, irritibility, disorientation, dizzyness, vomiting, seaizures, coma and death. It is not to be taken lightly. Interestingly, some of these symptoms are the same as dehydration... but if you are experiencing the above while your urine is still clear and copious (likely because you have dutifully been pounding drinks down) it is probably hyponatremia.</p>

<p>Prevention:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Regulate Water Intake</strong> : if your urine is clear and copious, chances are you are sufficiently hydrated. Ease back, even if you are thirsty.</li>
<li><strong>Eat Food.</strong> Salty food. Pretzels, nuts, trail mix, granola bars... anything you can find. The general advice among Grand Canyon guides is eat regularly throughout the day. If you do that, drinking plain, clear delicious water is fine. However, <em>drinking only sports beverages and not eating is setting you up for trouble</em>**</li>
</ul>

<p>**Sidebar: Several sources suggest that sports beverages can actually <em>increase risk</em> of hyponatremia since their deliciously tasty tangy sweetness can cause one to drink more fluid than they would otherwise.</p>

<p>Advice from the doctor at the Grand Canyon clinic as reported in the <a href=""http://www.nols.edu/alumni/leader/99fall/hypowhat.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">Wilderness Medicine Institute</a> regarding the issue:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Prevention is a matter of being sensible, which is so often
  the case. Drink lots, yes, but eat salty foods regularly while
  exercising in heat. ""Relying on electrolyte replacement drinks alone,""
  writes Dr. Myers, ""is absolutely ill advised.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If a patient is approaching a hyponatremic state:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dr. Myers warns, that giving oral electrolyte replacement drinks, such
  as Gatorade, alone might damage the patient. These drinks are so low
  in sodium and so high in water the dilutional imbalance may be
  increased.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a final note, this is not to advocate NOT drinking water while hiking, since Dehydration is just as bad and far more common. Be smart. Drink what you need, but not more. Be aware of what you body is doing.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Additional sources,</strong> all of which authoritatively conclude the sports beverages do not prevent the onset of hyponatremia. If you are drinking to much, it is too much, regardless of what you are drinking.</p>

"NNN (front clip) vs. telemark style bindings for backcountry XC skis","5294","","<p>I finally got to demo backcountry skis this past weekend and generally liked them better than regular skinny skate skis like they use for competitions because I like exploring off trail.  However, I had regular (NNN, I think) bindings and I still felt like I could use more heel control upon turns as my feet would pivot around the binding clip in the front as that is the only point of attachment between the foot and the ski.</p>

<p>Then I saw a lady that had skis as wide as mine and with a steel edge but she had telemark style bindings with a harness going around her heel and I think her toes didn't clip in but were just pressure gripped to the front part of the binding.  At first sight, it looked like that kind of binding would give me the heel support and control upon turning and in deeper snow. Of course, that system requires a different boot.</p>

<p>I would like to hear some more aspects of this telemark style binding vs the one I was using (front clip or NNN).</p>

<p><strong>SOMEWHAT RELATED:</strong>  <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/7646/why-dont-xc-skis-have-edges"">Why don&#39;t XC skis have edges?</a></p>
","<p>It isn't the bindings that give you the control you're looking for as much as it is the <strong>boot</strong>.</p>

<p>What you're looking at here is the crossover from old-school to new-school technology. Telemarks with the toe bails and heel cables have been around forever. The cables reduce heel friction, and do offer more down hill control, but there are newer technologies out there that pretty much render telemarking obsolete.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NnqX6.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>You're talking more about the culture of skiing when you start talking about telemarking than you are about superior technology. Telemarks were the backcountry ski of choice for many years, but AT skiing is quickly overtaking it on the Alpine skiing scene, and NNN and SNS have been dominating the X-country scene for years already because they are lighter, easier to use, don't ball up with snow and ice, and are cheaper, leaving Telemark as a kind of niche sport with a strong cult following. But even telemark is evolving more into AT, you'll notice that the telemark boots on the far right in the picture below are also <a href=""http://www.dynafit.com/en/equipment/bindings.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">dynafit</a> compatible, so you could use those boots with both telemark or AT bindings.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QUouJ.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>As you can see from the image above the two styles of skiing both have their extremes but also share some middle ground. </p>

<p>If you're just getting into it, and want to invest in new gear, I would seriously recommend going with an AT setup if the type of backcountry skiing you want to do is going to be mostly looking for an untouched slope to ski down, but if you're more interested in long tours, but want more control, then go with a beefier SNS setup like the one pictured second from the left above. I personally am partial to the SNS system over the NNN system, because they have a deeper heel grove that offers more heel control in my opinion, even more so with the SNS pilot.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hArUS.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Your other option is to demo some more gear, or pick something up second hand, I typically try a new sport out first on used cheap gear, then if I really like it, save up and invest in something good. We live in a day and age where there are lots of technologies that favour slightly different styles. So who knows, maybe you're a tele-groupie and just don't know it yet and telemark is the direction you want to go. There are still newer technologies coming out for telemarking, like the NTN binding system, and I hear they're developing hydraulic knee braces that allow telemarker's legs to last almost as long as AT skiers on the slopes (jokes, telemarkers will always burn their legs out way faster than ATers).</p>

"Why do horses need to wear shoes?","5292","","<p>Lately I chatted with my neighbor while the farrier was there, to provide her horses with new shoes. Later it made me wonder why they even need them. They don't have any in the wild, so why would they suddenly need some metal bars to walk properly? </p>
","<p>There are a few reasons why horses need (and in some cases need not to wear shoes).</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Weak hooves / easily cracked or damaged, or mentality. Some horses are prone to easily damaging their hooves. We had one pony who had worn shoes his whole life (he was around 14 when we brought him) and when his shoes were removed he had trouble walking and even over a space of 2-3 weeks was so distressed with lack of shoes the farrier had to come out and put the fronts back on (he had to not have rears due to stable rules but he managed fine with just fronts!). Wearing shoes slows the wear and tear horses get on their hooves.</p></li>
<li><p>Stability. Shoes for domestic / competition horses can come with stud holes. You use studs in bad weather, over the winter, in poor ground conditions. They are little bullet like screw in bits of metal that help the horse get grip in the bad conditions. This makes it harder to walk on the flat but are often used in Cross Country or sponsored rides in the winter seasons. I used these when I competed, when not in use you put a stud plug or some cotton wool in the hole.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8cWzD.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8cWzD.jpg"" alt=""horse shoe studs""></a></p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li><p>Management (this is a sort of side effect that's useful). All horses, even 'wild' ones need a way to care for their hooves. Shoes have a sort of bonus in so far as you really can tell when the farrier needs to come give them a trim! The 'wild' Dartmoor ponies even get rounded up once a year to have a trim because overgrown hooves can leave horses unable to walk.</p></li>
<li><p>Reason <strong>NOT</strong> to shod a horse - safety for other horses or humans. Imagine being kicked by a steel toe capped boot... but harder.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Horse shoes come along the lines of wearing shoes as humans, all a hoof is is a giant nail which needs trimming and care (You do yours don't you?).</p>

<p>Domestic horses should be re-shod or have their hooves filed every 4-6 weeks to maintain their hooves unless they throw a shoe. This is probably the biggest downside to shoeing a horse - in very muddy conditions older shoes tend to pull off like a welly!</p>

<p>Isn't Nor'easter supposed to move from the Northeast to Southwest, hence its name? But the recent Nor'easter that hit the Northeast right after Hurricane Sandy seems to have moved from the southwest to northeast, according to the meteorologic graphics that were shown all day long on TV.  Can someone explain?</p>
","<p>Yes, ""Nor'easter"" is derived from ""north-easter"" meaning the winds come from the northeast.  That is exactly what happens in a nor'easter.</p>

<p>You are confusing the wind direction with the travel direction of the storm.  The whole storm moves up the coast, but remember these are counter-clockwise rotation cyclonic storms.  The winds that bring the most stuff and the notorious bad weather hit the New England coast from the ocean.  These are usually the leading or northwesterly regions of the storm, so the winds themselves come from the northeast.</p>

<p>Remember that the names evolved long before people understood large scale weather patterns.  All people in Cape Cod, Gloucester, or ""down east"" Maine knew was that the nastiest weather accompanied by serious precipitation come howling from the northeast.  While not universally true of course, it's actually not that far off in the larger scheme of things.  ""Normal"" weather here in New England comes from the west.  Notable exceptions are the ""Montreal Express"" being cold and dry from the northwest, and a nor'easter bringing strong winds and serious precipitation from the northeast.  ""Nice"" weather from the northeast basically doesn't happen here.  The old mariners and fishermen knew a lot about local weather without understanding the global picture.</p>

"What should I do to avoid ticks other than wear particular clothing?","5265","","<p>Today I've learnt that one can't vaccinate against Borreliose, also known as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyme_disease"">Lyme Disease</a>. I've thought that I can't get that (yeah, that was stupid) and so didn't really care about ticks. However, since one really has to care about them, what should one do to avoid a bite in the first place? </p>

<p>Edit: </p>

<p>I don't ask for clothing only. I ask for tricks (like put your pants in your socks), chemical tools (creams etc.), natural tools (""cover yourself in honey"" or something =)), landscapes/specific places to avoid, time periods to deny and maybe even special kinds of movements to make or to avoid (and so on). </p>
","<p>You will pick up ticks by spending a lot of time outdoors, but I routinely find them after walking across 10 ft of grass between my car and my front door. No matter how much prevention you practice, keep an eye out for Lyme symptoms, and go to the doctor for antibiotics if they show up. A vaccine would be much nicer.</p>

<p>The socks-in-your pants method is very popular, but I've never been convinced it actually works: I usually find ticks around my head and neck, and deer ticks (the type that spread Lyme disease) are so tiny that it takes very little for them to hide. I feel like I'd need a skin tight light colored jumpsuit for this to be truly effective. Lighter colored clothing makes it easier to see ticks, but they still look like specks of dirt.</p>

<p>DEET is very effective against mosquitoes, but only slightly effective against ticks. Permethrin treated clothing is much, much more effective. You can buy treated clothing (such as InsectShield), or you can buy the chemical and do it yourself (Read all instructions carefully). I don't have the reference with me, but I read one study where ticks that walked on the clothing fell off and died within a foot of crawling. This is what I prefer to use when I'm hiking. Treated pants at the least, and a treated shirt if it's available.</p>

<p>The other thing to do is check yourself often. Look at your legs and clothing every time you stop. When you stop for the day, look yourself over as much as possible. If you don't have a mirror, have someone else check your back, where you can't see.</p>

<p>Ticks prefer to hang out on the tips of plants, usually in the sun. They have an instinct to reach the highest places possible. This does not mean you won't find them in the shade, but if you walk through a sunny field during tick season, you've got a very good chance of picking one or more up. </p>

<p>They prefer to bite you in the warmest places possible, ideally someplace with some cover. The head and groin area are most popular, but I've also had one on my hip and on my neck.</p>

<p>Having climbed at many many indoor walls (all over the uk) and done multiple outdoor climbs (bouldering and trad) pretty much universally I can climb much higher grades indoors than out. </p>

<p>For example at my local gym I I boulder at about V4-5. Outdoors I've completed one V1. In fontainebleu I was struggling at V0.</p>
","<p>The biggest difference in indoor climbing is that your routes are mapped out for you.  It can be challenging to figure out the proper sequence, but it's much easier if you know where all the holds are right away.</p>

<p>Another big factor is the abundance of large(ish) foothold.  When setting in a gym (from 7 years of personal experience) even the tiniest jib can be very positive.  Outdoors you struggle with purchase and deal with dirt/sand/etc... Which makes footwork even harder.</p>

<p>Some gyms make their grades soft on purpose, I've never really been able to understand why.  They think it's beneficial to the beginner climber, but consistency is more important.  Where I worked (in Seattle, WA) the grades would always stiffen back up when the setters got back outside in the summer, and soften a bit over the winter.</p>

<p>If nothing else, indoor routes are <em>set</em> with the intention of being climbed a certain way.  When we set we know the moves will work.  Outside it's just a blank canvas with a grade attached to it.</p>

They don't take up much space, they're easy to reuse (just boil) and they provide a fair bit of heat for a while.</p>

<p>However, try as I might I can't find any equivalent reusable packs that work the other way - i.e. they set of a reaction that draws in heat and makes them cold for a while, and then (I'd expect) you could put them in the freezer for a while to reverse the process.</p>

<p>I wouldn't really use them for hands, but they could come in useful for cooling you down generally - placing at the back of your neck for instance.</p>

<p>Do such things exist? Technically I don't see why it's not possible but I haven't seen any around at all.</p>

<p>EDIT: After a bit of looking around I stumbled across <a href=""http://the-therapy-connection.com/Jack-Frost-Instant-Reusable-Insulated-Ice/M/B000KWP79W.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">these</a> - perhaps they do exist after all! Has anyone used them? It looks like they're geared more towards medicine than general use but if the effect's the same that's fine by me.</p>
","<p>Instant ice packs, <a href=""http://www.koolpak.co.uk/products/original-instant-ice-pack-2/"" rel=""nofollow"">like this one</a>, which are usually used for treating sprains and strains sound a bit like what you are looking for. They use a chemical reaction to cool, but, they are single use only.</p>

<p>Such instant ice packs work by mixing ammonium nitrate with water. The hydration of ammonium nitrate is endothermic (absorbs heat). Perhaps unintuitively, you would need to apply more heat to dehydrate the ammonium nitrate <em>and</em> keep it separate from the moisture you are removing to be able to reuse. I guess this would be difficult to achieve in a simple reusable pack.</p>

<p>Personally, I like using my <a href=""https://www.buffwear.com/catalog/index.php/cPath/52"" rel=""nofollow"">buff</a> dipped a stream or river and worn round my neck to cool down.</p>

"What can I do about a rock climbing ban?","5090","","<p>Authorities have recently banned climbing in my favorite site ""for safety reasons"". This is, in my opinion, unfair, and was done for unknown political reasons.</p>

<p>What can I do to hopefully change their minds so that climbers can continue to access the site? </p>

<p>Also, what proactive/ preemptive things can I do as a climber so that this doesn't happen in other climbing areas? </p>
","<p>Access to climbing areas is an ongoing issue in many climbing areas. In the United States for example, it is claimed that 1 in 5 climbing areas is threatened by an access issue. There are many <a href=""https://www.accessfund.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">funds</a>, <a href=""http://squamishaccess.ca"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">societies</a>, and advocacy groups who work on behalf of climbers to protect public access to climbing areas, to keep them open to the public for recreational climbing. Try searching for an access group that works in your area.</p>

<p>The issue of access is not always so simple, as there can be multiple factors to consider when it comes to certain crags. Around where I'm from, there's pretty much open access to <em>everything</em>, because most of the climbing areas are on crown land. There are however a lot of cliffs and boulders that are on private land, and private land owners have the right to prohibit trespassing on their property. </p>

<p>The biggest concern with climbing on private property in some countries is liability. In North America for example, If someone gets hurt climbing a private crag, then the landowner is legally liable, and can be sued. Most land owners prefer to restrict access to their lands instead of risking the possibility of even one lawsuit. Local authorities are especially likely to restrict climbing on municipally owned lands, because they are regularly subject to a plethora of ridiculous claims (people frequently sue towns and cities because they can't be bothered to be accountable for tripping over their own feet on the sidewalks, and hurting themselves). In the USA this is especially common because in many cases suing is the only option an injured person has for paying their hospital bills.</p>

<p>One sensitive issue with a lot of climbing areas is the presence of native art on the rocks. I know of several areas nearby that are prime climbing areas, but climbing there is somewhat controversial because it can do damage to the ancient art on the stone. Access to areas where native art is present is often restricted, and it just so happens that in most places where native art is preserved on stone, the rock is prime for climbing.  </p>

<p>If climbing has been banned at your crag ""for safety reasons"" then it sounds like a local authority issue, in which case your best chance of restoring access is to partner with a access group, and petition the local authority. If you can show the authority that an area can be responsibly climbed, then they may work with you to open access to climbing. Talk to the CAO or City Manager about presenting to your council, that should always be your first course of action when seeking change in a policy in a municipality.</p>

<p>As far as preventing access issues, what you need to do is demonstrate that the area is being used responsibly. Leave No Trace ethics will ensure that no flags are raised about improper use of an area. I've seen crags full of garbage and covered with graffiti. </p>

<hr>

<p>There's a now-popular climbing area close to where I live that used to be closed to climbing. The Town of Frank in Alberta used to prohibit people from climbing on the millions of boulders which were the result of the worlds largest rock avalanche, that buried most of the Town early in the 20th century. I remember when signs used to be posted on the side of the road telling you that climbing on the rocks was prohibited. Today it's a renowned bouldering area with <em>thousands</em> of established problems, with more new problems being established almost weekly. Access was granted after it became clear to the municipality that bouldering was a huge tourist attraction, and promoting the area attracts a lot of tourism and benefits local businesses. </p>

","<p>This term is pretty vague. This paragraph describes it pretty well however:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dry camping means different things to many people.  The common
  definition I hear from people is camping in a location where
  electric/water/sewer connections are not available at each site.  This
  definition is very broad and includes everything from camping at a
  commercial campground with centralized facilities to driving out into
  the woods and pulling off into the trees.</p>

<p>You may have more luck <a href=""https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=dispersed%20camping"">looking up dispersed camping</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dispersed camping is the term used for camping anywhere in the
  National Forest OUTSIDE of a designated campground. Dispersed camping
  means no services; such as trash removal, and little or no facilities;
  such as tables and fire pits, are provided. Some popular dispersed

"How do I treat hot spots and blisters when I have no moleskin?","5069","","<p>A few times I've been out walking or backpacking and have no moleskin with me.  Sure enough, my boots start giving me blisters.  How can I prevent or treat hotspots and blisters without using moleskin?</p>
","<p>The key is reducing friction. Duct tape can be a good preventative as long as you get it on before a blister forms. After the blister is there, it's harder to recommend as once you're ready to remove the duct tape, you might pull the blister along with it. </p>

<p>Other options are to make sure you're wearing dry non-cotton socks. If you find your feet sweat a lot while walking, make sure you have good moisture wicking socks or you change your socks as the moisture builds up. Rotating socks gives one pair a chance to dry out while wearing the other.</p>

<p>If you're in the middle of a hike and forming hotspots without any tape, extra socks or moleskin to help, you may have to just slow down. Take a break, take your boots and socks off and give everything some time to dry out. It may be all you need to get back to civilization without developing full blisters.</p>

"How many calories does hiking burn?","5061","","<p>My girlfriend and I went for a walk on Sun. We climbed 3 peaks in Snowdonia. My girlfriend had one of them Nike tracking apps running on her phone all the while. In the end it gave us these stats:</p>

<pre><code>Distance: 20Km (as the crow flies)
Time: 8 hours
Calories: 4000
</code></pre>

<p>The calories though were based on us walking on the flat. It didn't allow for the fact that we'd climbed over 1000m multiple times. </p>

<p>So how many calories did we realistically burn in the period of time we were walking? or is there a better way to work this out?</p>
","<p>Those values seem to be over-exaggerated. I was once measured by the professional equipment (from the local university) and my callory usage was 5000-6000 kcal a day, with average 20 km hike and 1000 meters elevation. This included the normal metabolism per day (about 2000-2500 kcal) + increased metabolism because of cold temperatures in night. The measures was based on blood pressure and skin temperature, from what I know it was the top-tech device for current state of knowledge. </p>

<p>So the hike 20km + 1000 meters elevation would make about 2500-3000 extra callories for male about 65 kg, with heavy backpack. Those are the extra callories burned, the basic metabolism is not included. </p>

<p>The app may include estimated base metabolism, but the distance made is not enough data to estimate that value. That strongly varies between individuals. Therefore to realisticly measure your metabolism, you need to measure pulse and body temperature.</p>

"How to react to an aggressive boar","5016","","<p>As far as I know, boars are pretty aggressive when they have piglets. In the appropriate season, one might happen to hike into the path of an overprotective mother and get attacked. </p>

<p>How do I react to an aggressive boar? Are there any warnings or do they just instantly rush towards you? </p>

<p>Loosely related: <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/q/4203/2303"">What are the odds that I stand a chance against Wild Boars?</a></p>
","<h2>Possible threats</h2>

<p>First of all we should consider what threats may apply: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Potential Threats to Hikers from Wild Pigs wild boar with sharp tusks</strong></p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>Feral pigs can exhibit aggressive territorial behaviors.</p></li>
  <li><p>Hogs may weigh up to 300 pounds or more, can charge at least 11 mph    and can quickly attack hikers.</p></li>
  <li><p>Boars have four extremely sharp tusks up to five inches long that can    severely injure or kill a hiker.</p></li>
  <li><p>Hikers can contract disease (undulant fever, etc) from any contact    with an infected hog.</p></li>
  <li><p>Pigs can contaminate water sources with their feces.</p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I think it's especially interesting that a boar can harm you <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_boar#Diseases_and_parasites"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">more</a> than just with its direct physical charges. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xd3vN.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xd3vN.jpg"" alt=""Sharp tusks""></a></p>

<h2>How an attack looks like</h2>

<p><a href=""http://friendsoftheboar.blogspot.de/2011/10/what-to-do-in-encounter-with-wild-boar.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Friends of the boar</a> have summarized how an encounter might look like from the beginning. I want to show of the warn signs which should ring your bells to prevent an actual charge. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(If you see a group of boars,) at least one of the boars will become
  more active now, usually a juvenile, and will walk towards you, maybe
  a little nervous, sometimes turning round to return to the others. The
  move towards you is for a better look, for they have very poor
  eyesight.  Others may soon join in.  It may take just a few seconds
  for this to happen.</p>
  
  <p>Now, this is not aggression. They are not ganging up on you, but are
  being brave and facing their potential threat. They are like children
  now, excited and about to be proud of warning mum that they have
  spotted you. Mum may now join in, sniffing you and deciding whether to
  walk or run away. If she decides to run, she will belt out a loud
  grunt or snort, and turn tail. At this moment, all the younger boar
  will also flee at high speed away from you.  It's all rush and noise,
  and you hear feet stampeding away. That's usually it.</p>
  
  <p>Mum may stop shortly afterwards and take another look at you, maybe
  even walk back towards you. Again, this is not aggression. She is
  saying to you, ""You saw how fast we are so don't bother following.""
  She will either stay and start feeding again, or if you move towards
  her in the hope of a photo, she will grunt again and run.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How does a boar behave if push comes to shove? </p>

<p><a href=""http://friendsoftheboar.blogspot.de/2011/10/what-to-do-in-encounter-with-wild-boar.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Friends of the boar</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_boar"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Even in these terrible circumstances for the boar, the boar attack is
  very fast and is not a charge made from many meters away. The boar are
  close to the aggressor, maybe just a second or two away.</p>
  
  <p>Actual attacks on humans are rare, but can be serious, resulting in
  multiple penetrating injuries to the lower part of the body. They
  generally occur during the boars' rutting season from
  November–January, in agricultural areas bordering forests or on paths
  leading through forests. The animal typically attacks by charging and
  pointing its tusks towards the intended victim, with most injuries
  occurring on the thigh region. Once the initial attack is over, the
  boar steps back, takes position and attacks again if the victim is
  still moving, only ending once the victim is completely incapacitated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also be aware that there might be a different ""charge style"": </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A female bites you.  Her head doesn't lower. Instead, look for her
  shackles on the shoulders to rise and maybe her tail stand erect.  She
  will also growl.  </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>How to react</h2>

<p>A boar doesn't charge instantly. It gives you warnings (a lot of them actually - see the previous section). I know, the question is more about the point where it's already too late, but it's worth to mention how you can prevent a charge in the first place. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(If a) boar may walk straight at you (...), stand tall and shout at
  (it). Move towards (it) confidently but not aggressively, and (it) will
  probably move out of your way.  If (it) follows you don't panic but
  keep walking away - (it) will soon get fed up. Just be confident, if
  (it) is tame she will not hurt you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nearly the same thing applies to react to a the described ""bite attack"". If ever you see these signs, move away confidently, reassuring her with soft words rather than screams or shouts. </p>

<p>You may sometimes hear a growl from scrub where she is hiding with her
piglets. If you ever hear growling in the scrub, don't wait to see her, go back immediately from where you came.</p>

<p>You should take these actions to defend yourself: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>How to Survive if Threatened:</strong></p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>If you ever have a faceoff with a hostile pig your best option to defend yourself may be to climb the nearest tree, boulder, car, etc.</p></li>
  <li><p>You want to get at least 6 feet off of the ground because large pigs can somewhat ""walk"" up a tree trunk with their front legs.</p></li>
  <li><p>If a pig charges and you can't escape you can try to sidestep very quickly to avoid the potential swing of its tusks.</p></li>
  <li><p>Your last resort may be to physically fight back with whatever means possible until the mauling ends.</p></li>
  <li><p>While fighting back try to remain standing. People who fall or are knocked to the ground can sustain more serious injuries.</p></li>
  <li><p>Most assaults on humans are over in under one minute.</p></li>
  </ul>

"What is an equalette anchor?","5006","","<p>When setting up belay there are many ways to connect the anchors. One way is called equalette and is supposed to adapt to a certain extent to the direction of pull.</p>

<p>How is such an equalette constructed? If there is not one definite way: What are different ways of setting up an equalette and how do they differ?</p>

<p>There is a question <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/6854/when-to-set-up-a-cordelette-and-an-equalette"">""When to set up a Cordelette and an Equalette?""</a> where an partial image is supplied and a commentary debates whether this even is an equalette, so the topic seems to be debatable.</p>
","<p>The equalette is the evolution and combination of the cordalette and sliding-x. It makes up for the short comings of each system, while incorporating their strengths to produce a more SRENE anchor.</p>

<p>One of the criticisms of the <strong>cordalette</strong> is after you've tied the master knot, you have potentially poor equalization if you deviate from your set direction of pull. The <strong>sliding-x</strong> anchor offers auto-equalization, but at the expense of adding friction and elongation to your anchor system.</p>

<h2>Equalette:</h2>

<p>The below image shows an <em>example</em> of an equalette, it looks complicated at fist glance, but the strength of an equalette is that you can tie it with any combination of clove hitches and other knots to meet your needs given the availability of anchors on the rock, it's not necessarily meant to be tied the exact same way every time. For example, if you have four or more placements, then you can tie into them all using clove hitches vs using a figure eight on a bight on the third anchor in the image below. <strong>You adapt how you tie your equalette to your given situation.</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/L87Op.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/L87Op.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p><sup><sup> Image Credit: Freedom of the Hills</sup></sup></p>

<p>The equalette is tied from 6m (20ft) of 7mm or smaller diametre accessory cord tied with a double or triple fishermans knot depending on the material of the cord.   </p>

<p>To set it up, first tie of a 25cm (10"") section with overhand limiter knots near the middle of the equalette, this is going to be your self-equalizing clip in point. Where exactly you tie it may be offset from centre depending on where your anchors are relative to the direction of pull, but wherever you tie it, you're going to be left with two larger loops on either side. This is where you're left to your own creativity, using any combination of knots, tie the loops to your anchors using one or more elements per side. </p>

<p>Using two locking carabiners is preferable for clipping your rope to the equalette, clipping one biner into each of the loops between the limiter knots. You can still use just one carabiner, as long as you put a half twist in one of the loops to make a sliding-x, but this reintroduces friction into the system.</p>

<p>An equalette may seem complicated at first, but it addresses the shortcomings of other systems, and needn't take any more time to set up than other systems. </p>

<p>I had a few questions (though one was answered already here > <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/q/1845/3313"">What should be carried in a standard Geocaching bag?</a>) but my main question is typically for the UK due to people nature here, though all ideas are welcome.</p>

<p>So far we've a small geocaching kit consisting of pens, extra paper and lunch bag style plastic bags to help protect damp logbooks (of which thus far we have found many). Sometimes we pick up a few small items that we add in - so far we haven't taken any items out of a cache - these were mostly small toys, coins, etc. This is commonly what we find in caches as well.</p>

<p><em>Most caches we find currently are small (excluding micro) with the odd regular. And per item we would look to pay £3 or less, as we can find 6-7 caches per day out, but price does not necessarily constitute value to an outdoorsman. I would reserve pricier items for harder caches (4-5) but we are currently only finding 1-3 rated caches.</em></p>

<p>I am loathe to leave things like matches or fire starters or other useful outdoor tools such as that due to <em>idiots</em> who might abuse them.

<p>To quote a user's comment: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... could it give you any diseases or make you vomit to the
  point of dehydration, etc...</p>

","<p>This is a good question, and there are actually some scientific issues to consider.  I think morally we can all agree that it would be wrong to kill someone to eat them.  But let's consider the situation where you're starving, and someone has just died in front of you due to no fault of your own.  Is it ""safe"" to eat them?  Will it benefit you?</p>

<p>The first issue to consider is that most disease organisms are specific to the species they infect, or at least have a high affinity to a small number of species.  Therefore the more related you are to the dead animal, the more likely you are to pick up a disease from it.  Of course there are general pathogens too, so cooking the meat is always a good idea.  However, with something that can host the same diseases and parasites you can, like another human, the danger is even higher.  You really really want to cook the meat.</p>

<p>Another less obvious issue is what parts to eat.  Some organs contain high concentrations of hormones that can disrupt our normal processes if taken into the body as a whole.  The exact composition of most hormones is species-specific, although they will still have similar broad affects across species.  For example, insulin for use by human diabetics used to be harvested from pigs.  On the large tree of life here on earth, humans and pigs are quite close, so it worked, although probably not quite as well as true human insulin.</p>

<p>In particular, avoid glands like the pituitary and thyroid.  Such parts are even carefully not included in beef for human consumption, for example.  Eating human thyroids would likely be even worse than eating cow thyroids.</p>

<p>I would definitely avoid central nervous system parts, like the brain and spine.  The chances are rare of the dead human in front of you carrying a prion disease, but this is where the prions we know about apparently concentrate.  Note that prions are not destroyed by cooking, so you can't make prion-infested tissue safe for consumption in the back country.</p>

<p>This may sound far fetched, and it is, but it has happened.  Look up a disease called <i>kuru</i>.  Some time apparently in the 1800s at least on person in Papua New Guinea got infected by a particular prion.  Due to the cannibalistic customs in that area, his flesh was eaten, more people were infected, their flesh eaten, etc, until kuru was a serious problem by the min 1900s.  Once cannibalism in that area stopped, no new cases of kuru occurred.</p>

<p>Of course if you're starving, you're facing death by other means too, so it's a tradeoff of probabilities.  What I'd probably do is eat the obvious muscle tissue, after proper cooking of course.  Most of the edible flesh on the legs and arms is muscle.  Unless death by starvation is imminent, I'd stay away from other parts.</p>

"How to clean bones found outside?","4997","","<p>On a recent walk my girlfriend and I discovered a decomposed horse carcass, nothing but bones left. We took some photos and moved on. She's now decided that the bones would make great ornaments and we should go back and pick some up...?!</p>

<p>How is the best way to obtain and clean bones found in the wild? Preferably without obtaining some kind of skin eating disease in the process?!</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/C3Kh7.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>The great thing about finding bones outside is that for the most part, they're already clean! I'm from a small hunting town, going out for hikes to look for bones and sheds is a popular thing to do in the spring. I found bear skull on a game trail once, you don't need to do much more than collect them in a garbage bag or a cardboard box, old bones aren't toxic, just dirty. If you're going to use them for garden decorations then I probably wouldn't do anything to them, just drop them back in the dirt once you get them home, but if you plan on bringing them inside then you'll certainly want to clean them.</p>

<p>Taxidermists have several methods for cleaning a skull, the trickiest part is always de-fleshing (and getting the brains out) which is often done with maggots or beetles, but can also be done by boiling the skull, or just soaking it in water (which is stinky and gross). In your case it looks like nature has already done all the dirty work for you! All I would do no is boil the skull for a bit (outside, some BBQs having heating elements that work good for this) to disinfect it and soften up any grime you may need to scrub off (use a bottle cleaning brush to get up inside the skull and scrub away any leftovers) then proceed to whitening the skull. </p>

<p>Whitening is best done with Hydrogen Peroxide, you can use the over the counter stuff from the drug store, or you can buy the heavy duty stuff from a taxidermist. just soak the skull in a tub overnight or for a day or two (no longer or you can start to ruin the skull) then let it dry for about the same amount of time. </p>

<p>After your skull is nice and white, you can superglue any loose teeth back in place, and finish your skull with a spray coat of clear wood finish. </p>

<p>Of course you could always give your local taxidermist a call to see how much he would charge you to clean them up himself, you'd be surprised how cheap they'll do some jobs, it would probably be good to consult them about the condition of the bone either way.</p>

<p>I've heard some people say that singeing the tick with a match makes the tick detach and fall off. However I've also heard that the fire method makes the tick essentially vomit and is worse than just ripping the tick off. </p>

<p>What is the best method?</p>
","<p>Use tweezers, grip as near to the head as you can, and pull gently and evenly but firmly - it should come off cleanly. If it doesn't then be sure to remove the head rather than just leave it in there. Then clean the area with alcohol and be sure to keep an eye on it in case any rashes or other untoward symptoms appear. The likelihood of this depends on the area but it always pays to be aware.</p>

<p>I wouldn't recommend the commonly cited more ""violent"" approaches such as burning the tick or trying to twist it out. That will often do more harm than good and has a greater chance of leaving the head still embedded in the skin.</p>

<p>If you're worried about potential diseases then be sure to preserve the tick so it can be analysed later by a lab if necessary to determine any infections it may have been carrying.</p>

"Bowline knot, end at the inside or outside?","4933","","<p>Why is it advised (here at Outdoors) to tie a bowline knot with its ending on the inside (""Standard Bowline"") and not at the outside (""Cowboy Bowline"")? See pictures below.</p>

<p>If you're unlucky the end can get stuck, and you can't untie it.</p>

<p>Scenario: Tie a boat with a bowline knot around a pole. The end can get stuck between the line and the pole. With the wind pulling, forget the trip or cut it.</p>

<p>Also, I use different knots, but this is an official knot for tying a boat.</p>

<p>I couldn't find a pic with a pole and have no camera, but imagine a pole in the loop (of the inside bowline) to the left of the end. Then the end can be in between the loop and pole. Then imagine a tremendous amount of weight pulling the line.</p>

","<p><a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0385040253"">The Ashley Book of Knots</a> (published 1944) references the outside bowline as ""inferior"" but just says weakness nothing specific. In America the ""outside"" bowline is often called the ""Dutch"" bowline or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_bowline"">Cowboy Bowline</a>. So since, you ask, why is the bowline on Outdoor Stack Exchange tied with the end on the inside? because that is the classic bowline. End on the outside is a variant, like the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_bowline"">Double Bowline</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_bowline"">Water bowline</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosemite_bowline"">Yosemite Bowline</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowline_on_a_bight"">Bowline on a Bight</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_bowline"">Spanish Bowline</a>, or any of several others.</p>

<p>The general problem with the Dutch bowline is if something grabs, pulls or catches the tail end while its on the outside the knot will come undone easier. Under a shifting load with nothing snagging the end, it will last roughly half as long. Also, the Dutch Bowline is prone to capsizing (basically coming undone) if the dangling outside end is pulled the wrong direction, again it could just snag on something while the knot itself is pulled in another direction. </p>

<p>Please note, all of the above are arguments given by others. None of this has really been substantiated, but people will swear by it. I agree that there are several better knots to use in the example given, but addressing that wouldn't answer your question.</p>

"Week long trek, how far each day? pace?","4930","","<p><strong>Background info:</strong>
For environment, it is southwestern British Columbia and the weather is fair and there is plenty of water around.</p>

<p>Pace wise, on level terrain, with or without water I have sometimes been able to travel 20-30km (~15mi) with no break but feel quite sore and dead in the end beyond my lingering endurance. Going on 10-15km with breaks seems to be nice, and recoverable.</p>

<p>How should I go about my first week long trip in terms of distance, each day?</p>

<p><strong>My draft plan:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Wake up and do my morning routine</li>
<li>Hike from 7-noon (5hrs = ~20km with my ~40lb (18 kg) pack big pack)</li>
<li>Take an hour or two break for a main meal</li>
<li>Hike until 5pm or so (~4 hours = ~10-15km)</li>
<li>Set up camp, small nightly meal for energy and soak in the sunset.</li>
</ol>

<p>The journey is roughly 150km in a valley route by the way, which if I do that routine each day without falter can be done in ~4 1/2 days, but I plan to give myself lenience and visit small towns/and interesting things along the way giving 7 a good margin.</p>

<p>How's my routine sound? should something like every second day be half the distance, to help preserve my legs from lugging 40lbs (18 kg) or as felt is needed? (I tend to overdo it.) Any tips or hints on sustaining long distance travels for journeys many weeks long if I were to above this relatively simple starting trek, that I can practise?</p>
","<p>My personal opinion is you may be being a little bit optimistic on your speed. I would probably aim for 20-30km per day (~15 miles) if you have not done such a long trip before and are reasonably fit. Although there are several factors to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Hiking with a 40lb pack is significantly different and more tiring than hiking with just a day pack, especially if you get sore knees. This is a good reason to get hiking poles, although I know some people don't like them.</p></li>
<li><p>Doing a week long hike is not just doing a day hike seven times. You don't get a chance to recover fully in between each day, especially if didn't sleep particularly well because you're in your tent and rain/wildlife/whatever.</p></li>
<li><p>Terrain is also a significant factor. 20km on the flat != 20km with 6000ft of climb. As a rough guide <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith%27s_rule"">Naismith's rule</a> adds 1 hour (~5km distance) for every 2000 ft of ascent. If your route involves any bushwacking/river crossings these can take a significant amount of time too.</p></li>
<li><p>Your camping arrangement is also a concern. If you are wild camping distance is not too important. You can just go at your own pace and are only limited by the availability of suitable camping spots. However, if you are camping at a fixed campsite/campgrounds or otherwise have limited camping options it is better to be conservative on the distance you need to travel. There are few things worse than having some unforeseen detour/delay and then having to navigate to you camp in the dark.</p></li>
<li><p>This is more personal preference but I prefer to have several more regular stops than have one big stop for lunch. This may be because I mostly walk in the UK where it is often raining so stopping for long is grim. Also when it is nice regular stops are good for admiring the scenery and stuff.</p></li>
<li><p>Hiking is generally more enjoyable if you don't push yourself too hard. On one hand completing a challenging hike is very rewarding in its own right. However, speed and distance aren't everything. If you're hiking for a week you probably want to actually enjoy it while its happening. It is therefore important to not be completely exhausted/in pain because you've tried to do too long a walk. Some people I know may disagree with this idea. They also run mountain marathons for fun so....</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In conclusion 5 days would be a reasonable time to do your walk in, although it is definitely good to leave a couple of days extra in case there are any unforeseen issues/interesting detours/you're not as fit as you thought.</p>

","<p>If the wind is blowing from all directions, then you need to get as low as possible to the ground. Do your best to find a spot that is somewhat sheltered from the wind. The lee of a crest usually works, but if you have wind blowing from all directions then try to find a recess in the ground - a low spot where the ground that slopes up in all directions away from your bed, just make sure the ground you're setting up on won't pool water. If you can, build up a wind screen around your tarp using rocks, even if the best you can manage is a short wind screen of only an unstacked ring of rocks around your tarp. </p>

<p>Your priority is to seek shelter from the wind. It would be unwise to try and use your tarp to do this in such an exposed environment (not to mention deafeningly noisy). I've tried setting up a tent in the Nevada Desert with 90km+ wind gusts, personally, I think the easiest thing to do is simply lay your tarp flat on the ground, pile rocks around the edges then slip in underneath it. It's not worth bothering with poles and tie lines, you don't want any wind to get underneath your tarp.</p>

<p>If no rocks are available, then your best bet would probably be to use the tarp as an emergency blanket, and wrap yourself up in it, then lay on top of the edges. If you're serious about trying to set up your tarp, the configuration I'd try first would be the Mushroom fly from the illustration below, which isn't much different from my suggestion to pile rocks on the edges of your tarp and slide in under it, except that you've got a small pole in the middle.</p>

","<p>When checking to find out what kind of earthworm we might be discussing, I found sources listing anywhere from 100 to over 6,000 species.  That wasn't very helpful so I'll just skip it and assume you have some common variety of earthworm that's present around many parts of the world!</p>

<p>The short answer here is that they were most likely trying to get to a place where they could dig a tunnel, and succumbed to the elements along the way. The actual elements, however, may not be exactly what we had in mind. It doesn't sound like it got cold enough to freeze them, so I doubt that's why they died. (An interesting fact from <a href=""http://www.infoplease.com/t/sci/earthworms/"">here</a> is that earthworms can freeze solid and still live if the freeze is slow and they do not thaw out and refreeze often. I don't think that applies here, though!) Likely it was a combination of things, including a few that DudeOnRock already mentioned.</p>

<p>Earthworms always have tunnels, but as the weather gets cooler, they dig deeper and wider in preparation for the winter. A quick temperature drop can cause them to come out for a short while instead. They don't come looking for warmth, though, but as a mission to find a different place in your yard to dig more trails and hunker down for the winter. They may also grab some snacks, like bugs, along the way, to give them energy for the cold weather to come. Your stones are pretty tight, but there may have been something in the crevices that they wanted to eat. </p>

<p>The most common cause of environmental earthworm death is dryness, and I think that's the bottom line here. Something happened along the way which caused them to dry out, which resulted in their demise. </p>

<p>Earthworms breathe, meaning get oxygen, through their skin. Without enough oxygen, they literally suffocate. In order to absorb the oxygen, however, they must be wet all of the time. This explains the coating of slime (mucus). It's protective.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q. How do earthworms breathe?
  A. Earthworms respire through their skin, and therefore require humid conditions to prevent drying out. They coat themselves in mucus to enable the passage of dissolved oxygen into their bloodstream. <a href=""http://www.biologyjunction.com/earthworm%20facts.htm#breathe"">Source.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>They need to be wet to dig the tunnels for the winter, (up to about 6 feet or 2 meters, depending on the location and species), to eat, and to procreate. They have no bones, and move through a series of muscle movements which only function when wet. </p>

<p>If it had recently rained, and your stones were wet, they may have been attempting to use them as a shortcut to their final destination. One of the reasons earthworms come up in the rain is to make traveling easier. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q. Why do worms come onto driveways and sidewalks when it rains?</p>
  
  <p>A. Dr. Dennis Linden, Cindy Hale, and other worm experts say that worms come to the surface during rains (especially in the spring) so they can move overland. The temporarily wet conditions give worms a chance to move safely to new places. After rain or during high humidity are safe times for worms to move around without dehydrating. <a href=""https://www.learner.org/jnorth/search/WormNotes3.html"">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>From <a href=""http://www.todayshomeowner.com/earthworms-taking-over-driveway/"">Why are earthworms taking over my driveway</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When the soil is too dry, they burrow deeper to find moisture. When the soil is wet, they move closer to the surface. When there is adequate surface moisture or humidity, they venture out above ground and look for new places to burrow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even if your terrace was nice and warm, they would not have been looking for a warm place to hang out. In general, it's very dangerous for earthworms to be out during the day. Light dries them out, literally paralyzing them when they're in it for more than an hour. They lose the ability to seek a safe spot, and die on the rocks.</p>

<p>Also, basements and garages can not support life for earthworms, so they're not generally programmed to seek shelter in those areas. They may be protected from harsh temperatures, but since there's no opportunity for digging, eating, obtaining moisture, or hibernating they'll pretty much always die. If you ever find a live earthworm inside, putting it out may save it. Even if it's winter, if you can dig an area in the dirt more than a few inches deep,  putting them in it can give them a fighting chance. Most likely they'll freeze, but not always. </p>

<p>This brings us back to where we started. I believe they were on their way to a place for a permanent winter home, and something happened along the way which caused them to dry out. That dryness was the likely cause of death. </p>

<p>Interesting fact:</p>

<p>This wasn't true in your case, but it's worth knowing that earthworms which are curled into a round ball are usually alive, even if you don't see them moving. Due to a variety of environmental factors, they enter a state similar to hibernation, in that their metabolism slows down, but the worms are awake. In winter, it's called ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diapause"">diapause</a>"", and in the summer it's called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aestivation"">aestivation</a>.  Curling up is mostly to preserve their water and oxygen. If you find them like that, they should be carried to a warm, moist area on the grass, if you have one. At some point, they'll come out of it and go about their activities. </p>

","<p>Pneumonia is not what you have to be worried about in this situation. It is a serious pathologic condition of the lungs commonly (but not exclusively) cause by viral or bacterial infection. Unless you were previously infected it is not likely to catch anything away from civilization.

If you already have frostbite and have any means of calling rescue, do that. If you feet are still fine you can walk towards civilization, walking should keep your feet from getting frostbite at 0 degrees with apropriate shoes. When stopping your wet feet are in high danger of cooling out, so you cannot stop for long. Including other problems like the blisters you will probably develop with wet feet it will probably be inadvisable to try to go on, so again get rescue if you can. In case this is no option you will just have to walk on, there is not much to do. For the night you can obviously remove the shoes and thus should be fine (or at least not worsening).</p>

"Leaving a fire unattended for a few hours, then returning","4907","","<p>What is the best way to leave a fire unattended for a short time and then to return to use it again? </p>

<p>Here is my imagined scenario: arrive at a camp site and start a fire in a pre-made iron fire pit. Cook and eat dinner over the fire. Then, leave the fire unattended and go hiking for a few hours. Then return and cook dessert over the fire. There will be tents in the vicinity. </p>

<p>Should I put it all the way out and then restart it from scratch, or is there a more effective, but still safe, way to leave the fire unattended?</p>

<p><strong>Edit after @ShemSeger's answer:</strong></p>

<p>Of course I do not want to leave ANY chance of a fire spreading, so maybe a better way to phrase my line of thinking is: what is the best way to completely put out a fire that I will be returning to? I imagine that soaking all the wood in 6 inches of water will make it difficult to restart. Is burying the best way to go?</p>
","<h1>Fires must be attended at all times!</h1>

<p>There is no such thing as, <em>""the best way to leave a fire unattended for a short time,""</em> your fire is either being attended, or your fire is thoroughly extinguished and your pit is left cold, <strong>no argument</strong>. There are no conditions where an open pit fire can be left alone and be 100% guaranteed not to spread. It's the people who ignorantly assume they can walk away from their fires who are often responsible for carelessly ignited forrest fires. My father is a fire captain in a small mountain town in the Canadian Rockies, his department is regularly called out all summer long to extinguish brush fires started by unattended fire pits.</p>

<p>If you have plans to leave your campsite after a meal then you should probably plan a meal that can be prepared <em>without</em> a fire, or which can be cooked using a stove, either that, or you prepare a small fire, just big enough to cook with, then extinguish it before you leave, you can still use your partially burned wood when you get back, just put it on top after you've got a new fire going again.</p>

<p>Not only is never leaving your fire unattended a universal rule, it's also a <em>written</em> rule in every park and campground. In some places it's even illegal, and you can be fined for doing it.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> <em>(in response to OP edit to question)<strong></em>:</strong> If the fire is <strong>hot</strong> <em>(doesn't matter if it's above ground or below)</em> then you <strong>cannot</strong> responsibly leave it unattended. </p>

<p>If you are planning to leave camp immediately after cooking over a fire, then you should to take those plans into consideration while initially building it. Use only as much wood as you'll need to cook, and start cooking as soon as you have some hot coals and the flames die down a bit. Once you start cooking, <em>stop</em> adding wood to the fire. The coals will burn hot for a long time, and provide you with a good constant heat if you build your fire right. When you're done cooking, kill your fire by spreading the wood out in your pit and exposing the coals. The flames should die almost immediately as the insulation provided by the logs is removed. Spread the coals around your pit and stir them into the dirt/ash beneath. At this point, <strong>soak</strong> the coals and logs, and continue to stir the coals around until they are cool enough to touch. If you can't put your hand on them, then they are still too hot to be left alone and can easily reignite themselves <em>(I've seen fires come back to life long after they had been ""extignuished"")</em>. Pour as much water as necessary onto your fire until it is cool enough to touch.</p>

<p>At this point, you may safely walk away from you fire. When you return, rebuild your fire with <strong>new wood</strong>, and use the burnt logs to either help build the base of your log cabin or leave them around your new fire to dry and add them on top after. The old wood will dry out quickly enough, and continue to burn to ash.</p>

"Can I upgrade my MSR Wisperlite International to also be able to burn propane?","4895","","<p>I used someone else's Wisperlite Universal for the duration of a trip and it looks like the only functional difference is a jet that can be attached for burning propane. Can I purchase just that jet and burn propane with my Wisperlite International?</p>
","<p>This question honestly could be too localized on these specific products. However, considering the ubiquity of these stoves I find it is probably quite useful information to know if they could have interchangeable parts.</p>

<p>MSR's Whisperlite International &amp; Universal stoves are very similar products, but they have some fairly notable differences. Let's call the <a href=""http://www.cascadedesigns.com/msr/stoves/simple-cooking/whisperlite-international-2012/product"" rel=""noreferrer"">Whisperlite International</a> the WLI and the <a href=""http://www.cascadedesigns.com/msr/stoves/simple-cooking/whisperlite-universal/product"" rel=""noreferrer"">Whisperlite Universal</a> the WLU just to make it a bit easier.</p>

<p><strong>Let's look at the WLI &amp; WLU parts first:</strong></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BJuJd.png"" alt=""Whisperlite International""></p>

<p><em>taken from <a href=""http://media.cascadedesigns.com/pdf/MSR_WLI_StoveInst_EN_USJC_LORES.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">MSR WLI product manual</a></em></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YPOd.png"" alt=""Whisperlite Universal""></p>

<p><em>taken from <a href=""http://media.cascadedesigns.com/pdf/MSR_WLU_StovInst_EN_USJC_LOWRES.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">MSR WLU product manual</a></em></p>

<p>As you know, the WLU is the newest iteration of this famous stove that is compatible with not only multiple liquid fuels, but also canister fuels. To achieve this the WLU departs in design from the WLI by having two adapters on the fuel line: one to connect to a canister and one to connect to the traditional MSR pump. This means the WLU's fuel line and generator tube are different parts from the WLI. The WLU has a UC jet that is designed for use with canisters in addition to the liquid fuel UK and UG jets used for both stoves. <em>(The older model WLI uses different jets than the current model WLI.)</em> The WLU also includes a canister stand for more efficient burning in cold weather and with low fuel.</p>

<p><strong>So theoretically a WLI could be converted to a WLU with the following parts:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Fuel line and generator tube</li>
<li>Liquid fuel line adapter</li>
<li>Canister fuel line adapter</li>
<li>UC jet for use with canisters</li>
<li>Canister stand</li>
</ul>

<p>However, purchasing these parts would take a call to customer service of Cascade Designs, as they are not available through standard channels. Though your local MSR outdoor retailer may be able to order these parts for you. The real issue is going to be whether the cost of these parts is actually much cheaper than buying the WLU.</p>

<p>Either way, it does seem possible to convert at least the current generation WLI into a WLU.</p>

"Is burying human waste always the lowest-impact solution?","4829","","<p>According to leave-no-trace principles, one should bury human waste (poo).</p>

<p>But burying damages plants and roots.  Is this really always better than not burying it and pooing on the surface?</p>

<p>(Of course, the only way to truly leave no trace is to not go at all.)</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> <em>This assuming a context when I am carrying everything on by back; solutions that require carrying significant additional mass are not preferred.</em></p>
","<p>In more temperate climates (forests, jungles, etc.) burying feces <a href=""https://lnt.org/learn/principle-3"">is preferred</a> as it will be broken up by microbes in the soil while being somewhat protected from the environment.  Plant growth in these areas is also rapid enough that cut roots are generally a non-issue.  (I'm assuming you aren't hacking through larger roots.)  In general the warmer the climate the better the decomposition.</p>

<p>Deserts, canyons, and alpine areas above treeline represent special cases; there is generally a lack of organic soil in which to bury waste and vegetation grows very slowly, if at all.  In such areas, particularly heavily impacted ones, packing out waste via WAG bags is preferred and sometimes legally mandated.</p>

<p>On rarely-visited routes in the high alpine there are <a href=""http://blog.alpineinstitute.com/2008/08/human-waste-disposal-in-alpine.html"">two other options</a> which are sometimes used: the first method is to go on a rock then toss it down a moraine or crevasse.  The second is to smear it into a paper-thin layer on a rock facing the sun; the sun and wind will slowly bake and abrade it away.  (It's worth noting that the Leave No Trace Center for Outdoor Ethics found most people don't spread it thin enough.)</p>

<p>Regarding toilet paper, many advocate packing it out.  I've heard differing opinions on how well it decomposes in the wild, and often that's climate dependent.  Outside of areas with good organic soil I would pack it out.  Another option that many use is to skip toilet paper and use snow, rocks, or leaves instead.</p>

<p>In terms of supporting data, <a href=""http://www.crctourism.com.au/WMS/Upload/Resources/bookshop/humanwaste.pdf"">one Tasmanian study</a> looked at decay rates of different products (facial tissue, tampons, as well as bleached and unbleached toilet paper) at different sites and with or without added nutrients (i.e. poo).  The <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479704001781"">actual paper</a> appears to be paywalled, but the results suggest unbleached paper is slightly better, tampons decay much slower than the other products (and should probably be carried out), and outside of alpine/subalpine areas decay proceeds at a good pace, particularly when combined with waste:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There was a significant site×time×treatment interaction in the generalised linear model for mean decay rates which included 6 m (a/w), 12 and 24 months (Table 2). At 6 months over autumn and winter mean decay of products was well-advanced at the coastal eucalypt forest and the grassy eucalypt forest, but negligible in the lowland rainforest, the heathy eucalypt forest, the montane moorland and the western alpine sites (Fig. 2). By 24 m decay was almost complete (at least 75% decayed) at all sites except the montane moorland and the western alpine site (Fig. 2). At all sites, except lowland rainforest, there was a significant positive impact of nutrient addition on decay (Fig. 2). The impact of nutrient addition on decay was most marked at six months over autumn–winter (Fig. 2).</p>

"Is it offensive to ""just hike"" on a pilgrim's path?","4797","","<p>I am considering taking a pilgrim's path - Olaf's Trail - in Norway (about 3 weeks). However, I don't want to do it for any religious reasons. I just saw this trail in pictures and thought: ""What a great hike!"". </p>

<p>Would it be offensive towards the pilgrims or the Catholic religion in general to ""just hike"" on this trail without religious motives? </p>
","<p>No, it would not be offensive.</p>

<p>A survey of 200 pilgrims on the Camino de Santiago found that motivations were as follows, in order of importance:</p>

<ol>
<li>Exercise</li>
<li>Adventure</li>
<li>Peace, solitude, relaxation</li>
<li>Spiritual (but not explicitly religious)</li>
<li>A lifetime experience</li>
<li><strong>A religious pilgrimage (9.6%)</strong></li>
<li>To meet people.</li>
</ol>

<p>Source: <a href=""http://caminoways.com/camino-stats-top-reasons-people-walk-the-camino"" rel=""noreferrer"">Top reasons why people walk the Camino</a></p>

<p>As you can see, under 10% viewed their walk as a religious pilgrimage, and this is on a route between two Catholic countries. In a country like Norway with only 5% of Catholics I would imagine that the percentage of religious pilgrims would be smaller still. So as a non-religious walker you would be very much in the majority.</p>

<p>Is this use of these old pilgrimage routes offensive to the minority who still use them for religious reasons? I know people who have completed the Camino and have read many accounts - I've never seen it even hinted that this was an issue. Provided you are sensitive to the feelings of the pilgrims you can be comfortable that no-one will object. And as Ken Graham has pointed out in his comment, pilgrimages are not a sacrament of the Catholic Church and are open to all.</p>

<p>So it would be perfectly appropriate to walk the route to simply enjoy the country and the experience. I hope you have a great time! </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Historical note</strong></p>

<p>If you've ever read Chaucer's <em>Canterbury Tales</em> you'll know that motivations for pilgrimage have always been varied. In the regimented medieval world, this might be your only opportunity for a holiday and an adventure. As with the modern holiday industry there were package tours, guidebooks and accommodation touts.</p>

<p>I found the following account of the atmosphere around shrines like St Olav's and Santiago de Compostella:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the sanctuary itself, particularly the famous ones, pilgrims would be met by a large noisy crowd. In a city like Trondheim, where many pilgrims wandered to visit the grave of St. Olav, there were many people making money from the pilgrims.  Amongst the fellow pilgrims, there would be buskers and entertainers, market stalls and pickpockets, beggars and prostitutes. There were primitive postcards and souvenir pilgrim-badges to buy from licensed traders. Pilgrims showed particular interest in the exotic products, spices, wines and silks, not available at home. Many pilgrims also indulged in a little bit of 'duty free', hiding their purchases from the customs men or bribing the appropriate officials to turn a blind eye.</p>
  
  <p>Inside the sanctuary, things were little quieter. As the day progressed, crowds grew and the wine flowed freely. At Santiago de Compostella, the priests despaired that 'all sorts of noises and languages can be heard together, discordant shouts, barbarous singing in German, English, Greek and every other language under the sun'. (Sumption: 213) The behaviour was such that many sanctuaries, such as Durham in England, employed the equivalent of 'bouncers' to keep order and eject those who behaviour was considered too 'rude'. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If anything, the non-religious hikers of today are more respectful than the religious pilgrims of the past!</p>

<p>Have anyone ever made a make-shift harness out of such tape slings?</p>

<p>Now, Why don't I carry a actual Harness with me, is valid question. I'd do that most of the times, but yeah the way like the last time around I missed it, I may again do the same.</p>
","<p>I'll preface this by saying I've never tried this in a real world application myself, but I was curious and found some instructions for creating quick harnesses out of webbing from a web search.</p>

<p>I want to add that I am in no way endorsing this for climbing or prolonged use beyond a static hang or an emergency situation.  I've heard and read that rope/webbing harnesses can be quite painful and can possibly cause injury if someone were to fall in them, due to lack of padding.</p>

<p>The first way I found is from the <a href=""http://blog.alpineinstitute.com/2011/02/harness-alternatives.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">American Alpine Institute blog</a>, which, half-way down the page mentions the diaper sling shown below, and then another alternative called the Swiss Seat <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qogNohudpo"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">shown in a Youtube video</a> or <a href=""http://www.animatedknots.com/harness/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">similarly here</a>.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Ipz0.jpg"" alt=""Swiss Seat Harness from Animated Knots""></p>

<p>The next is called a Diaper Sling. <a href=""http://www.bogley.com/forum/showthread.php?23400-Make-a-Diaper-Sling"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">From here</a>:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MrWNC.jpg"" alt=""Diaper Sling Instructions""></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Diaper Sling</p>
  
  <p>You'll need one piece of 1-inch tubular webbing. The length will vary
  depending on the size of your waist and thighs but 12-feet is usually
  plenty.</p>
  
  <p>Create a loop out of the sling by tying the ends together with a Water
  Knot.</p>
  
  <p>With the loop horizontal (parallel to the ground) run the top half of
  the loop across the small of your back, and the lower half of the loop
  below your buttocks. Keep the knot towards the front so that it is
  smooth against your back and thighs.</p>
  
  <p>Then, reach between your legs, to grab the lower loop and pull it in
  between your thighs. Keep holding on to the original loop!</p>
  
  <p>Finally, clip the whole mess together.</p>
  
  <p>Ta-da.... you have created a diaper sling.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I used the instructions to create a test diaper sling myself, and it seems like it would hold me, but if i really needed a harness I'd probably opt to spend the time making the Swiss Seat.</p>

<p>As I mentioned above, mountaineering harnesses can be little more than stitched webbing with some added thickness which might be a better alternative if this is going to be more than a one time use.</p>

<p>One last comment addressing your question. I don't know your exact use case, but using rope while crossing streams/rivers is generally risky business. <a href=""http://www.adn.com/node/1387901"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">For example</a>, ""The two hikers had tied themselves onto a rope that had been placed across the stream earlier this summer. They lost their footing and were pulled under by the current."" Though there are techniques to use rope and anchors to successfully cross streams/rivers, when misused the rope can get pulled into the water, creating lots of drag and usually taking whoever is attached right off their feet. You might be quite experienced with this, so I'm just leaving this as a general fair warning.</p>

","<p>I can only partially answer this question, and my information is not particularly up-to-date, but I've contacted a friend who has been there recently and added his answers to my own.</p>

<p>In April 2004 I flew Kathmandu-Lukla, and returned via bus from Jiri to Kathmandu. I remember the flight costing about a hundred dollars. My friend flew in September 2013, and he says it cost around $300. He says the price varies from day to day and season to season. Both he (recently) and I (then) booked the flight just a few days - no more than three - in advance after arriving in Kathmandu.</p>

<p>On the way back, it took me five or six days to walk from Namche Bazaar to Jiri. Unlike the area from Lukla to the Everest Area (and the Gokyo area, which I also visited), the trail back to Jiri was relatively empty of tourists, though the Nepali villages were no less bustling. I was walking alone, but I didn't feel much of a risk. Of course feelings of danger are a very subjective thing, but that was my experience.</p>

<p>After arriving in Jiri, I bought a local bus ticket back to Kathmandu in the evening, and took the morning bus, and arrived in Kathmandu that evening.</p>

<p>Some caveats:</p>

<p>This was during the civil war / Maoist rebellion. On one hand, that sounds a bit alarming, but the situation did not affect tourists <em>that much</em> (though I'm very glad for Nepal that it's over).</p>

<p>The difference between the area above Lukla and between Lukla/Namche and Jiri was relatively extreme. Above Lukla there were hundreds of tourists around, and it was easy to meet people - I arrived alone and found traveling companions quickly. Below Lukla I met less than ten tourists a day.</p>

<p>The big caveat is that this was a very long time ago.</p>

"Protection from rain - running vs. walking","4731","","<p>Let's assume there's a reason to stay dry from rain. You've a form of a basecamp which can keep you dry. </p>

<ul>
<li>Running reduces the time spent in rain</li>
<li>Walking reduces the amount of drops you ""run against""</li>
</ul>

<p>There may apply other reasons, too! Just share them. I just wanted to give an idea what the question is all about naming these two points. </p>

<ul>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>(...) what we care about is not the number of drops that hit us, it's our
  ability to maintain our body temperature (...)</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>I have seen (and had) many 'accidents' from running in the rain</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li>Running may attract wildlife</li>
</ul>
","<p>It depends on the amount of rain and on the surface you are running/walking on. Now, there is unquestionably a threshold where the amount of rain makes the time exposure factor so significant that running wins without any doubt.
However for lighter rain there might be another factor that turns the result. </p>

<p>I remember reading a news paper article about running versus walking in the rain with text from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_News_Agency"">NTB</a> (and as far as I remember the experiment was conducted by NTB itself as well) maybe 10-20 years ago, where the conclusion was that walking made you least wet, based on weighing the clothes before and after the experiment. Unfortunately I am unable to find any references to it now.</p>

<p>Searching for it, I found many references to mathematical calculations like for instance <a href=""http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/63759.html"">here</a>, which presents the assumptions for the calculations</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are, as you pointed out, two  sources of wetness - the rain
  that runs into you (on your head and  shoulders), and the rain that
  you run into (on your front).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and this is not correct, there is also a third source of wetness - water thrown from the ground with you shoes. And for this factor running is much worse than walking, which also was the conclusion from the NTB experiment.
Of course running in urban areas where the rain does not penetrate the ground is much worse than running on grass for instance.</p>

<p>So for heavy rain running is best (ignoring the risk of falling), for lighter rain it depends and walking might be the best option. The fourth source of wetness, sweat, I do not think is very significant compared to the other three.</p>

I understand that the most basic functionality will theoretically be the same, i.e. be securely attached to you and have a sturdy loop you can tie/clip into. I'm interested in knowing what differences there are beyond the most simple functionality though. If I were to purchase a harness, what types of features would I be looking for that would lend themselves to climbing vs. mountaineering or both?</p>
","<p>There are many types of specialized harnesses, including harnesses for sport, trad, and mountaineering. Personally I use the same harness for trad and mountaineering, and it works fine.</p>

<p>For trad climbing, you want four gear loops. Since people don't carry such heavy racks for sport and mountaineering, some harnesses specialized for those activities may not have that many gear loops.</p>

<p>For sport climbing, there is no real need to go to the bathroom while keeping your harness on. For mountaineering and multipitch trad, this becomes more of an issue, especially for women. Some harnesses have leg loops that are easy to drop or release for this purpose.</p>

<p>For mountaineering, you need to be able to put on your harness while wearing boots and possibly crampons. For this reason, it may be more convenient to have adjustable leg loops.</p>

<p>For trad it's pretty common to have to hang on your harness for a long time while belaying. That's going to be more comfortable if you have wide, padded leg loops.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that people used to just tie in with a bowline on a coil. Manufactured seat harnesses are a relatively recent invention. Some people who prefer a light and fast style of mountaineering just use a loop of webbing that they can make into a diaper sling.</p>

"Paramo vs Gore-Tex jackets?","4691","","<p>I'm considering replacing my North Face Gore-tex jacket as it's starting to get a bit tatty, some of the zips are breaking, etc.</p>

<p>I've seen quite a few <a href=""http://www.paramo.co.uk/en-gb/index.php"">Paramo jackets</a> about. I'm presuming they're quite good as they are the jackets I see a lot of mountain rescue members and mountain guides wearing. </p>

<p>A mentioned this to a friend and he said, ""they're the marmite of mountain equipment, some people love them, others hate them"" but didn't elaborate further. </p>

<p>So what does a Paramo jacket do that's different to Gore-tex? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each? </p>
","<p>I have a high-end gore-tex jacket and my wife has Paramo.  I also have Paramo trousers.  They are quite different: Gore-Tex is designed to be a physical barrier that prevents water getting through, while Nikwax Analogy (the fabric in Paramo jackets) is designed to be highly water-repellent and wick water quickly from inside to out rather than being actually waterproof.  Buffalo (pertex/pile) is a similar concept in some ways.</p>

<p>In practice, my experience is:</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Analogy is softer and quieter (no rustle)</li>
<li>Analogy is much more breathable than Gore-Tex</li>
<li>Analogy is less likely to wet out as the DWR is particularly good - so breathability in tough conditions is also better</li>
<li>Because it's not based on the idea of a watertight barrier, rips and tears are easier to repair - just sew</li>
<li>Paramo is an <a href=""http://www.ethicalconsumer.org/shoppingethically/bestbuylabel/p%C3%A1ramo.aspx"">Ethical Consumer Best Buy</a> company  - the fabric can be (and is) re-used to make new garments, the process doesn't use PFCs (see <a href=""http://www.nikwax.com/en-gb/aboutus/persistentflurocarbondanger.php"">this page</a> for some references - biased but does link to research), the production directly supports social projects in Colombia <a href=""http://hillandmountain.paramo.co.uk/Why-Paramo/Why-choose-Paramo/Ethical-production"">link here</a>, etc etc.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Nikwax Analogy is heavier than nearly all Gore-Tex fabrics</li>
<li>it also tends to be warmer (I guess could be an advantage in some conditions)</li>
<li>Analogy will let some water in under pressure (sitting on wet grass, leaning on wet rock, sometimes under rucksac straps), though it dries and wicks out very quickly</li>
<li>I think the Paramo jackets are pretty ugly.</li>
<li>less garment choice as fewer companies use Analogy (apart from Paramo, <a href=""http://www.cioch-direct.co.uk/"">Cioch</a> also use it - and they do made-to-measure/custom)</li>
</ul>

<p>I really rate Paramo: many have been the times when I've been clammy sweaty and cold inside my Gore-Tex while my wife has been dry and comfy.  I particularly like the trousers: they are so breathable and comfortable that they can be worn next to the skin all day (in cold conditions), saving the annoyance of dragging waterproofs on and off as the weather changes.  However it is warm and heavy.  For Scottish winter it's probably ideal; for mountain marathons less so!</p>

<p>It's worth adding that this relates to the standard jacket (Cascada).  Paramo also do a line of tops with separate water repellent and wicking layers, so you can mix and match according to conditions - possibly saving some weight if conditions aren't too bad.  I have no experience of those.</p>

"How to safely store a propane/butane/isobutane canister in a vehicle?","4689","","<p>The canisters that I have purchased so far have included a warning not to let the canister get above 120 degrees Fahrenheit.

<p>I would prefer not to leave on a backpacking trip with an extra canister left in my vehicle and come back to find that it had exploded. What are some things that I can do to prevent that from happening?</p>
","<p><strong>The background</strong></p>

<p>It took me a moment to find it, but an example of a car in which this happened can be seen <a href=""http://bushwalk.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=18061&amp;start=30#p251344"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>.  If the fuel in the canister becomes sufficiently warm the pressure can rupture the canister.  Usually the bottom everts first, popping outwards, although I have heard of instances where this was immediately followed by it coming apart, so this should not be considered any form of early warning measure.  At this point you have a few ounces of liquid butane that's rather far above its boiling point and suddenly under very little pressure, so it almost instantaneously transitions to gas and vapor.</p>

<p>Such an event is called a BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion).  Fire does not need be involved; in the referenced image above there are no signs of fire damage.  If you are particularly unlucky, friction or sparks can ignite the cloud of vapor, possibly resulting in a fuel-air explosion.</p>

<p><strong>How to avoid it</strong></p>

<p>Don't park your car in the sun, or don't keep fuel canisters in it.  However, on some trips this might be unavoidable.  I suggest considering the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>For vehicles with a separate trunk, store the canisters in the trunk and not in the passenger compartment, which will be heated more due to the greenhouse effect of the windows.</li>
<li>Find a way to insulate the canisters, such as placing them in an ice chest or wrapping them inside a blanket or sleeping bag.</li>
<li>Depending on your area, caching them outside the vehicle may be considered.  Of course, that also makes them more likely to grow legs and walk away.</li>
<li>Sunshades, car covers, and cracked open windows may also help.</li>

"Is Paradoxical Undressing a stage beyond Hypothermia?","4658","","<p>We all have discussed and read Hypothermia quite a lot of times and are aware of general concepts about it. What made me wonder the most was an incident about a mountaineer on Mt. Everest.
With the sort of wisdom I have, I still can't see why he is still alive (No offense, that is a great thing and I am awestruck as well as very happy for him) and how he made it.</p>

<p>That guy was stranded, it was a team of two if I got the whole documentary right. And they did summit and this fellow here, got stranded and had a Bivouac between Camp III and Camp IV. Later in the morning he was found undressing himself and standing at a cliff which seems like he is totally out of his mind. He was later rescued by a team who gave up on the summit attempt and chose to bring him down.</p>

<p>Looking at the situation, He should have died of the Hypothermia.
Is Paradoxical Undressing a later stage of Hypothermia? Because the actions/symptoms speak absolutely otherwise.</p>

<p>Have anybody more study or information about this stuff? Yes, I can simply browse for it, but there is too much sci-stuff and physiology stuff said about it, and that didn't help much.</p>

<p>How can it be treated? Does the same treatment as Hypothermia helps to treat this thing?</p>
","<p>Between the moderate hypothermia stage it has been noted that a body will trick your senses into thinking it is burning up. So you naturally begin to strip.  Here is a more direct answer from Survivaltopics.com </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A funny thing happens to people when they get hypothermia. Many of them strip off their clothes as one of their last acts before they die. This is common phenomena among fatal hypothermia cases and is known as “paradoxical undressing”.  Why in the world would someone who is literally freezing to death take off their clothes?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s the answer from SurvivalTopics.com:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now the key to what causes paradoxical undressing. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction"">Vasoconstriction</a> occurs when the smooth muscles within the vasculature contract. This effort requires a steady input of energy in the form of glucose from the body’s energy stores. However, due to a lack of blood now travelling to these muscles, they eventually tire. As the muscles of the constricted blood vessels run out of energy, they fatigue, relax, and open up. This is known as vasodilation.</p>
  
  <p>With vasodilation of the blood vessels, an infusion of warm blood from the core of the body rushes into the peripheral extremities. This causes the hypothermia victim to feel overly warm and to start shedding layers of clothing, contrary to the reality that their body temperature is continuing to drop.</p>
  
  <p>The victim’s warm blood rushing from their core, coupled with the removal of warm clothing, causes their body temperature to fall even faster. This serves to hasten death from hypothermia and results in another case of paradoxical undressing.</p>

"Fishing Rods: One Piece or Two Piece","4647","","<p>A number of fishing rods you can buy have models that are 2 piece and models that are 1 piece. I have heard people say their rods snapped in half when they were 2 piece. However, it would be extremely beneficial as far as portability to have 2 piece. What are the pros/cons of each? Would one be better than the other? Since this may be brand specific, I am thinking mostly about Shakespeare Ugly Stik models, but any general information would help!  </p>
","<p>I fish for everything from 9"" brook trout to 15 lb. bluefish to 40 lb. striped bass on both fly rod and spinning tackle, and honestly I don't think I would say that one is better than the other except for the fact that with 1 piece rods you don't worry about losing your tip, OR that with multi-piece rods you can cart them around more easily (and reduce the risk of slamming the tip in a door or something.)</p>

<p>Nowadays the difference between the two is getting almost too little to talk about. Some will argue that a 1-piece is more sensitive, casts better, and is stronger. One thing for sure is that a 1-piece will never separate when casting or fighting fish - something that happens more than you would think due to people not checking the connection in their two piece rods.</p>

<p>That said, most fly rods are multi-sectional. Since they depend on their flex to fight fish and their strength to cast line, it could be argued that having multiple sections is a non-issue. Modern ferrules and lines do a great job preserving sensitivity.</p>

<p>I believe that only Lamiglas is making 1-piece surf casting rods larger than 10'. From what my tackle shop says, a change in shipping rates made it too costly to ship anything longer. So everyone else is making two piece rods for anything longer than 10'. </p>

<p>I have both one piece and two piece. I mostly fish a 1-piece simply for the fact that I never have to pack them and I won't have to worry about the tip flying off after a cast. BUT, if packing size plays any part in the decision, I don't hesitate to take a multi-piece rod. </p>

"Toothpaste in the back-country and the principle of leave no trace","4647","","<p>I am a staunch proponent of leave no trace. I don't carry dish detergent (sand and small rocks work much better on stainless steel anyways,) and I don't use soap or shampoo, not even of the biodegradable kind (being smelly I have heard might even help with repelling mosquitos...) I do however use toothpaste, and am feeling pretty bad about it, since I leave a chemical behind in the wilderness. When I spit out my toothpaste, I attempt to spray it over a large area, to avoid creating concentrations of the chemical, and I avoid leaving it behind on fragile vegetation, but I would like to find an alternative that adheres more to the leave no trace philosophy. What are my options without sacrificing the health of my teeth on those multi-week treks?</p>
","<p>Even for ""multi-week"" trips, brushing with water alone is not going to compromise your tooth health. The abrasive action of the brush does most of the work, and missing the flouride hit for a few days won't affect your teeth in the least. Plus, it saves weight. So, the best LNT option: <strong>don't use it</strong>.</p>

<p>If you MUST use toothpaste (or an alternative), try a few of these options:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Swallow it</strong> - pick up a toothpaste made for babies and children made with the explicit understanding it will be swallowed. (Even regular toothpaste says, ""do not swallow more than used for brushing"" which seems to indicate it won't hurt...)</li>
<li><strong>Pack it out</strong> - If you are truly leaving no trace, then you are packing out your poop too right? So coordinate your tooth brushing with other trace-forming activities.</li>
<li><strong>Spray it</strong> - The ""broadcast spray"" method has long been championed whereby you spew the toothpaste out in a fine mist so there is no ""blob"" of toothpaste to attract hungry critters. It does spread the smell, so do this FAR away from camp in bear country.</li>
<li><strong>Dilute it</strong> - in some areas, the recommended method is to spit normally, then urinate on it so there is not a large gobble-worthy glob for some critter to munch on.</li>
</ol>

<p>And remember, even if you are using baking soda, or other ""natural"" alternatives, <em>these still need to be dealt with properly using one of the above methods</em>. It is pretty gross to arrive in a well-camped area and see white minty smears on all the vegetation regardless of whether it's ""natural"" or not.</p>

"What are the measurable prerequisites of strength and/or flexiblity for starting to climb in a climbing gym?","4638","","<p>If I were a couple of decades younger, I would seriously consider trying climbing in a climbing gym, but I doubt I have enough flexibility, and I would feel horribly out of place.  The thing that attracts me is the total concentration required; there are things I want to put right out of my mind at least temporarily.  </p>

<p>But I am curious:  is there a measurable criterion for what level of upper body strength a person should have before even beginning?  Are there any other measures of strength or flexibility that are pre-requisites for starting this sport?     </p>
","<p>No, there are no particular prerequisites for indoor climbing. Strength, flexibility, endurance will come along the way. Just take a look into any gym, you will see small, large, fat, weak people. In my place there regularly is a one-armed guy...</p>

<h1>The gym</h1>

<p>Look for a large, well-run, popular gym. Good signs are:</p>

<ul>
<li>A nice, inviting website which shows all rooms/walls of the gym; explains how everything functions; explains any rules.</li>
<li>Beginner and advanced courses.</li>
<li>Being chock full at prime time.</li>
<li>There should be a small gym-inside-the-gym with assorted equipment (boards to hang from, maybe some weight training stuff).</li>
</ul>

<p>I would <em>strongly</em> suggest taking a beginners course. Those <em>are</em> available for adults. While it may feel weird, just shrug off the feeling. Do not be shy, talk to the coach, ask questions, actually <em>do</em> what she says, and so on.</p>

<h1>A partner</h1>

<p>But the main reason for taking a beginners course would be to find another beginner to start your journey with! Exchange phone numbers with someone who seems to be close to your level of body strength, fitness, etc.. Find a weekly ""jour fixe"" where you regularly meet. The time/day-of-the-week of the course is a good starting point, as both of you obviously had spare time right then!</p>

<p>Then just go and climb. You will find that you will improve very quickly. Do not be shy watching better climbers (i.e., everybody else). Nobody will think bad about you; most people will remember how it was when they started.</p>

<p>The partner is important because a) motivation and b) talking about how to tackle different problems. As both of you will have different arm/leg lengths, mobilities, etc., you will quickly see that you will take different approaches to climbing, so you will learn from each other, even if you both are beginners.</p>

<h1>Bouldering</h1>

<p>I tried to get into indoor top-rope climbing twice, and it did not work out. The problem is that you are absolutely tied (sic) to having a partner around (so no spontaneous night at the gym) and downtime is <em>much</em> worse. One of you is <em>always</em> not climbing; and when the gym is full, the fullness is much worse, so to speak, since each climb takes longer. Also, frankly, I had incidents with lazy/inattentive partners while my life was literally hanging from a thread... </p>

<p>Bouldering to the rescue! I encourage you to skip all the complexities of top-rope climbing, and go straight to bouldering, if you have a gym that focuses on that. Bouldering might not look like much, but it is <em>very</em> intense, and since you do not have a long climb for every route, it is much easier for the route setters to give you many, many more diverse problems.</p>

<p>If a bouldering hall is full, it's not such a  big problem. You get queues in front of the walls, but since each attempt takes only a few dozen seconds, 1-2 minutes max, you get to climb rather sooner than later. Also, when the difficulty rises, you need the time between tries to recover your strength anyways, so it is actually good to see what others are doing at ""your"" problem.</p>

<p>Given that throwing them away was one option, I didn't see the point in trying anything <em>weak</em>. We all know the phrase ""kill the mold on your shoes or destroy them trying"". These are tough sandals and have seen quite a bit of abuse during the years. I'm a bit emotionally attached, which means that I don't really want to throw them away. Here's what I did exactly:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>wet cleaning with a brush and a regular general purpose cleaning agent</strong>. As suggested by @Russel (+1 for that), this keeps the mold from getting into the air and thus into me. The downside is that it also destroys the custom fit footbed out of dirt and sweat, which took me almost a decade to build up. What a bummer!</li>
<li>Then I got myself some <strong>cleaning agent that's specifically made for (against) mold</strong>. The purpose is to clean bathrooms, not shoes. But as they say, the enemy of my enemy is my friend. When shopping for this stuff, go for the most ridiculous name that you can find. Mine was labelled ""mold annihilator"". If you can find one with an image of Vlad the Impaler or Hitler, even better, go for those! Otherwise, buy the one with longest list of warnings. They usually contain bleach.
As @Shem suggested: <strong>let them soak</strong>.</li>
<li>I then put them into the <strong>washing machine</strong> to get rid of the Chernobyl cocktail. The slowest setting (400rpm) and 40°C worked great. If you have, put them in a bag and add some additional load to the machine.</li>
<li>Then I dried them in the sun quickly.</li>

<ul>
<li>Belaying can take quite some time, so you're asking the person to give up a chunk of their recreation time to a total stranger. It's not like you're asking someone to help for 30 seconds</li>
<li>You're putting your life in their hands, literally. That's a big decision. What if they're also a complete novice but feel embarrassed to admit it. I wouldn't let anyone belay me unless I was confident they knew what they were doing and trusted them to do it</li>
<li>Don't go to a two-person sport venue by yourself. What if you get to the cliff and no one else is there?</li>

<p>Find a climbing partner(s). Learn together. It can be rewarding and build a great relationship as you both improve. You'll have someone to share your climbing highs and lows with.</p>

<p>Of course I feel bad for the brown squirrel but people around here act like it's the end of the world. They say that it somehow matters for the overall habitat/natural environment. Does the growing number of grey squirrels and the according shrinking number of brown squirrels really effect the complete natural balance? </p>
","<p>Yes, they do damage habitats, namely from bark stripping, and disease. This is why the UK class them as a pest. However it is not limited to grey squirrels as red squirrels also strip bark, but they have much smaller numbers proportionally so their damage is proportional. Lack of grey squirrels therefore does not wholly prevent this damage. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In addition to displacing this native species they
  frequently cause damage to woodlands by stripping bark
  from the main stem and branches of trees</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This has an effect commercially and natively. This can lead to a loss in food for red squirrels, birds, dormice etc.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Such damage acts as a major disincentive to the planting of
  broadleaved and coniferous trees for timber as it reduces
  the value of the final crop. Increasingly wider impacts are
  being recognised as potentially of major significance to
  woodland conservation, biodiversity and sustainability. In
  time damage may lead to a loss of particularly vulnerable
  species (e.g. beech) within the mature canopy of woodlands
  and this may be accompanied by loss of associated fungal
  and invertebrate fauna and their predators. In addition,
  there may be indirect competition, e.g. for food, between
  grey squirrels and native fauna such as the red squirrel
  and common dormouse; or predation by grey squirrels,
  e.g. on woodland bird populations. Grey squirrels also carry
  squirrelpox virus, an infection fatal to red squirrels.</p>

"eating ash in Soviet Union","4599","","<p>My Polish grandfather in early 1950's was sent by communist regime to a gulag. People were starving there and malnourishment was common, so they came up with idea of burning some kind of trees and eating the ashes.</p>

<p>Do you know what kind of tree can be devoured like this? And why ashes? How does this method work?</p>

<p>I'm asking here, because it is strictly a survival thing.</p>
","<p>This is not a survival technique. </p>

<p>The way to determine how many calories is in a particular food item is to measure the amount of heat energy emitted when an item is burned. Anything burned to ash is basically calorie free as far as food value goes.</p>

<p>Ash is composed of whatever was unable to vaporize into smoke in a fire. The hotter the fire, the more material burns. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_ash"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wood ash</a> has a lot of calcium carbonate and potash (potassium salts) (~35-55%). Traces of metals in the wood will be concentrated in the ash, because it takes a very hot fire to vaporize them. Wood ash can be used to fertilize plants, but not people. It probably wouldn't poison you, and you might get a few trace elements (or some heavy metal poisoning, if the ashes were concentrating some of that).</p>

<p>This is the sort of desperate measure you can try when you are starving to death, and are willing to try anything, even stuff that rationally, you know won't help. I'd expect it to stave off starvation about as well as eating dirt: there might be some questionable, miniscule benefit, but don't plan on it as a technique to live longer.</p>

<li>Carefully mark the location of the leak with a needle/pin (you've got to fix the leak anyway) as you will lose it as soon as you rinse the soapy water away. You may try a grease pencil or china marker but not much else will write on a soapy wet surface. <em>(Note that a grease pencil or china marker can leave residue which can impede adhesion of the patch. If you use one of those, make your reference marks outside of the range of where the patch will go. A pin or needle is best.)</em></li>

<p>I've had to use this method several times and it always works. Be systematic about it so you can keep track of what you've checked. Usually leaks occur on the bottom of your pad, or they could be at a failing seam, so target those areas first. Also you might have to refill the bottle once or twice before you find the leak, depending on the size of the pad and just how lucky you get. If you're mix isn't sudsy enough, add more soap.</p>

"What to do if you cross paths with a buck?","4588","","<p>On my last bike ride I was riding on a trail and I was going pretty fast, fast enough that I went around a corner really fast and there was a doe right in front of me. I stopped as fast as I could. We both looked at each other and it looked more scared than I was. I was looking around to make sure there wasn't a buck near by. If it was a buck I had run into, it would have been more likely to attack me. So now my question is, what should I do if I run into a buck? Should I bring anything to protect myself that won't kill the animal? Pepper spray perhaps?</p>
","<p>Specifically for biking, they do make spray cans to keep dangerous animals away. Most of my experience with these products have been dealing with loose dogs. I would think it could be used for an animal the size of a buck, but obviously more research than my word should be taken there.</p>

"What is a hammock ridgeline and how do I use it?","4542","","<p>I'm working my way into ultralight backpacking (Knee problems) and have taken interest in hammock camping to drop weight during the summer months. I've hung and slept in hammocks before and found them quite comfortable, but I hadn't heard of a ridgeline until I bothered to look for a solution to rain/bad weather (kinda necessary in the Pacific Northwest).</p>

<p>My question contains several parts (forgive me if these are brutally obvious): </p>

<p><strong>What is a hammock ridgeline? Where is it attached (to the hammock, the attachment points, etc)? What do I use it for?</strong></p>
","<p>A ridgeline is generally used to suspend a tarp above a hammock. It attaches to the trees at or near the level that the hammock attaches to them, but it is pulled tight so that it is well above the level you will be sleeping at.</p>

<p>Some hammocks, such as a Hennessey, have integrated ridgelines. Others, like ENO, do not.  In the Hennessey hammocks, the integrated ridgeline helps to provide an asymmetric shape for the hammock (which offers a wider, flatter sleeping area), while also providing support for the tarp.</p>

"Why do some birds fly in a V-formation?","4509","","<p>When birds gather into groups, they fly in a variety of different formations and patterns. </p>

<p>Some birds fly in a formation that looks like the letter ""V"". Several species of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goose"" rel=""noreferrer"">geese</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelican"" rel=""noreferrer"">pelicans</a>, and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibis"" rel=""noreferrer"">ibis</a> are just a few of the more commonly known. This is their normal flying behavior, but can be more evident during migration due to the large numbers headed in the same direction. </p>

<p>Many of the other common birds fly in swarms or flocks without any obvious pattern. There's also a type of flock, exhibited breathtakingly by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starling"" rel=""noreferrer"">starlings</a>, which is called a <a href=""https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/bird-and-wildlife-guides/bird-a-z/s/starling/roosting.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">murmuration</a>. It's a group of literally thousands of birds flying in magnificent and unique patterns.</p>

<p>I took the picture below over a lake in Rhode Island, United States, recently. The geese had just taken off and were flying in some side-by-side V-shaped groups. As they got farther away they gathered into smaller, tighter, individual V-shaped groups. Of course I've seen this behavior before, but on that particular evening, as I watched these geese leave the area, I began to ponder it more deeply. </p>

<p>Why do some birds fly in a V-formation? Is it just a random pattern or is there a reason for it?</p>

","<p>They fly on the wing currents produced by the birds in front of them. It's similar to drafting someone in front of you while cycling or racing. The leader is breaking trail, and the followers are benefiting by exerting less energy. They end up in a V-formation as birds join up one after the other and find a wing to fly on. After a while, the leader gets tired and falls back onto the wing of another, giving a different bird the opportunity to spear-head through the wind.</p>

<p>Here's a National Geographical article that details the specifics: <a href=""http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2014/01/15/birds-that-fly-in-a-v-formation-use-an-amazing-trick/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Birds That Fly in a V Formation Use An Amazing Trick</a>.</p>

<p>From the article: As a bird flaps, a rotating vortex of air rolls off each of its wingtips. These vortices mean that the air immediately behind the bird gets constantly pushed downwards (downwash), and the air behind it and off to the sides gets pushed upwards (upwash).</p>

"How do I treat a blister? How can I prevent getting them in the first place?","4485","","<p>When hiking with a new pair of boots or if I haven't been hiking in a while, my feet might get blisters.  </p>

<p><em>How can I treat a blister and keep hiking?</em>  Are there things I can do to <em>prevent getting blisters?</em></p>
","<p>Here is my magic blister treatment method.  You need to have this stuff in your kit:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanolin"">Lanolin</a>:  Yes, otherwise known as sheep grease.  Sold in pharmacies as an aid for breastfeeding mothers.  It is essentially a lubricant wax that will keep a blister happy and not stuck to what you put over it.  You put a daub of this directly on the blistered area.  Polysporin or that type of thing does not last as well as this stuff.</li>
<li><strong>Lambs wool</strong>: Take a bit of this and cover over the lanolin.  Regular cotton balls do not cut it.</li>
<li><strong>Athletic Tape</strong>: Use large strips of tape to cover over the blistered area and enough on each side to keep the tape attached.  Make quite a few layers.  You'll know it's enough when you put your boot back on and walking no longer hurts.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can do this and leave it on until the end of your trip.  Ideally, you don't want to get the setup wet for the first day.  If it's pouring out, cover the whole mess with one layer of duct tape.</p>

<p>I'm honestly not sure why it works, but I have fixed some horribly nasty blisters with this method and walked for 100s of kilometers afterwards.  One particular happened on the Pacific Crest Trail, walking across a desert section, I wore a large circular area off my heel.  When I eventually limped to a halt in the first bit of shade I found, this stuff together got me moving again with zero pain.  Without fiddling with it, I was able to walk for days afterwards, 30+km per day.</p>

<p>I know that giardiasis and many other diseases take a week or two to develop by which time I will have either died in the wild, or have been rescued. Are there quick-acting ones that will debilitate me faster than dehydration?</p>

<p>To drink, or not to drink?</p>
","<p>Dehydration will very quickly reduce your ability to undertake the activities required to survive and so finding and conserving water should be a very high priority in any survival situation. </p>

<p>Clearly there are potential dangers associated with drinking contaminated water but these need to be weighed against the dangers of dehydration. As with most survival decisions this is based on a balance of risks to the best of your knowledge. </p>

<p>If at all possible you should find the safest possible source of water and your basic outdoor kit should include several methods for treating drinking water but if it comes down to a choice between drinking iffy water and dying of thirst then the answer is obvious. </p>

<p>The only exception to this is when you suspect that the only water available would do you more harm than good. Salt water or anything which is obviously grossly contaminated may just speed up dehydration, many water borne diseases cause diarrhea and vomiting which will just dehydrate you faster. </p>

<p>Ultimately this comes down to your preparation, both in terms of the equipment you have with you and your knowledge of the environment you are in and planning for finding water in an emergency should be part of your preparation for any expedition. </p>

<p>Similarly if you are unsure about the water you have available it is sensible to hold off drinking it until you do actually need to. </p>

"Can I mix fuels when using the MSR whisperlite international stove?","4461","","<p>I have an MSR whisperlite international stove. Can I mix fuels when both require the same jet?</p>

<p>Background: When backpacking I often just carry one fuel bottle, filled with white gas. On my last trip I was running low on fuel and wanted to stock up. The only fuel I was able to get was unleaded gasoline. I didn't want to waste the white gas I had left, and wasn't sure if I could just fill up the bottle with the gasoline, mixing the fuels. Has anyone experienced or heard of adverse effects mixing fuels?</p>
","<p>Not all fuels mix well. However, in the case of <em>white gas</em> and <em>unleaded gasoline</em>, one is basically a (much) cleaner version of the other, so you're not mixing so much as diluting the white gas with its inferior (for cooking) sibling.</p>

<p>Still, you would get better performance out of the remaining white gas if you don't mix it with the unleaded. There's really nothing stopping you from carrying the gasoline in a lightweight bottle (say, a plastic water bottle, or an old nalgene. Just be sure to mark it very well and dispose of it responsibly afterward to make sure nobody drinks from it) and filling it into the stove fuel bottle after you've used up the clean white gas.</p>

<p>Another issue with using fuels other than white gas in the whisperlite is that they burn dirtier. There is more carbon buildup in the stove, and you will likely have to service it or unclog it sooner with more usage of less clean fuels. So make sure you have the tools and the know-how for disassembling, cleaning, and reassembling your stove in the field (obviously, you should only disassemble the parts that are clogged in the field, and then do the complete service at home when you return from your trip.)</p>

<p>Now, the caveat emptor with burning gasoline in your camp stove is that this gasoline isn't really designed for cooking and heating, but is intended primarily for automotive purposes. As such, it has many additives and dyes in it that are toxic and or dirty, and you should make sure to minimize skin contact and inhalation of fumes as much as possible. <strong>More importantly, wash your hands with soap after handling the stove and gasoline, and ESPECIALLY BEFORE HANDLING FOOD!</strong></p>

<p>Then again, the above precautions should be taken with regular white gas as well... So yeah.</p>

"Minimum safe rappel rope diameters?","4457","","<p>9mm is considered minimum for a vertical rappel with a nylon or polyester kernmantle rope, 6mm with <a href=""http://www.scarpa.com/edelrid/rap-line-60m"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">high strength aramid</a>, but what if your rappel isn't vertical? What's the minimum safe rope diameter for rappelling a slippery slope that may be 60° or less? </p>

<p>I'm asking because we plan on going here this summer:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NdAAp.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""> </p>

<p>Where if you make one slip then you're going for a wild luge run to the centre of the earth with an unhappy ending.</p>

<p>I'd rather bring one <em>really</em> long rope, then carry several heavier, shorter ropes. </p>

<p>I picked up one of these a while back: <a href=""http://www.bluewaterropes.com/product/mini-rescue-8/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mini Rescue 8</a><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bqSMF.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""> </p>

<p>which is made for rappelling on 7.5-9mm ropes. I'm not really familiar with any common situations where you rappel on a 7.5mm rope, but I'm thinking that using one as a fixed line for a non-vertical descent may be one of them.</p>

<p>When is it considered safe to use ropes &lt;⌀9mm for a descent?</p>
","<p>It isn't that unusual to use 8mm rope in caving on vertical (at least in Europe) especially in deeper caves with more rope to carry down and of course, back out again.</p>

<p>In the US cavers tend to rig pitches from a single anchor and take care that there are no sharp bits of rock the rope could come in contact with and use rope which is more abrasion-resistant. In Europe we will place intermediate anchors (a ""rebelay"") on longer pitches which helps prevent rope rub and speeds up abseil and ascent as the pitch is split into sections. Also this means that thinner rope can be used as there should be no chance of abrasion because of rubbing on rock.</p>

<p>Ropes are rigged such that the chances of the rope rubbing anywhere on rock is reduced to nil (or as near as possible) because when prusiking back up ropes, any rope rub will damage the rope and with thinner diameter ropes, the safety factor with respect to damage is much reduced. </p>

<p>I often visit a local old lead mine with a 100 metre shaft which is generally at an angle 45 degrees or steeper with several large steps or platforms cut into the rock at different points. Even though the angle is nowhere near vertical, the shaft is not straight as it wasn't bored by a tunnelling machine but formed partly be natural activity and partly by miners. This means that a single length or rope would rub at various points, both on the lower side of the shaft and also on the upper side.</p>

<p>Cavers do not use Figure of Eight or similar descenders due to the fact that they twist the rope and can be dropped when attaching or detaching to or from the rope. Cavers use either racks (<a href=""http://www.petzl.com/en/Sport/Belay-devices--descenders/RACK?l=INT#.VNNfoNKsU3Q"">for example</a>) or ""bobbin"" type descenders (<a href=""http://www.petzl.com/en/Sport/Belay-devices--descenders/SIMPLE?l=INT#.VNNf3dKsU3Q"">for example</a>) as these do not twist the rope and remain attached to your harness even when loading or unloading the rope.</p>

<p>Although you intend to descend a slope, if it is of any real length other than a few metres, I would treat it as a normal abseil (or rappel) and would be happy to use 8mm rope (bearing in mind my points above). However, below this diameter I would be worried about the ability to absorb any shock in a fall or any possibility of damage from abrasion. Even on a slope, a fall can occur. For example an intermediate belay could give way. </p>

<p>Known numbers:  1443R, 1622E, 10G, 10GX, 1460, RV, 14M... (may be others)</p>

<p>A Note:  I can just go buy a ""Tyvek Footprint"".  However I believe the products specifically marketed as footprints are just one of the above types, re-branded and marked up 10x.</p>
","<p>From what I've discovered there are really two main types of Tyvek: hard-structure and soft-structure. The numbers you refer to are variations in applications of the two types. Hard-structure, type 10, is most commonly recognizable in the housewrap application and is suitable for a ground cloth. It is stiff, noisy, and loud but that can be remedied. Soft-structure has two main varieties: types 14 and 16. Type 16 (1622E, 1673) is not suitable for a groundcloth as it has lots of tiny holes in it. Type 14 (1443R) has a soft hand and is just as water resistant as type 10 (10G or 10GX) so either type 10 or 14 will work for your application.</p>

<p>I might recommend the hard-type as it will be easier to lay out your groundcloth to cut and measure. After you have completed it you can then wash it several times to soften it and make it more manageable. It also will be easier to find as you can get it at both Lowe's and Home Depot. However, I don't know if you can buy small quantities there. You also might check construction job sites (with permission) as they often have some left over that they just throw away. I got almost 30 yards of good Tyvek this way because they had tossed it.</p>

<p>Elsewhere people are largely left to their own devices so practices range from finding a good ledge to leave your waste on, doing it straight over the edge or using a 'sh*t put' method involving pooping on a stone that can then be thrown away from the wall. </p>

","<p>Already some great answers here. TBH, haven't been able to go through all of them, so adding in a short summary as what I do and ask people to follow.</p>

<h2>Answer to question 1:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Rule of thumb: Never ever ever <em>ever</em> try to handle a snake.</li>
<li>If you don't know what snake it is, whether venomous or not, or a semi-venomous, refer rule #1.</li>
<li>If you don't know a snake well enough, you obviously don't know how far it can strike. Then, should you go near it? No. Refer rule #1.</li>
<li>If you know what snake it is, beware, refer rule #1.</li>
<li>If you don't know a snake well, you can never be sure whether it's a juvenile or grown adult; in that case refer rule #1.</li>
<li>If you don't know a snake well enough, you don't know if it is haemotoxic, chemotoxic or neurotoxic, refer rule #1; but WHY do I need to know that? Because if somebody is bitten, the medics will ask you what snake it was, and how it looked, so that they can start treatment with the appropriate anti-venom. </li>
<li>If it's not passing, and just laying on the path, ask someone to keep an eye on it and the other should see if you all can try to take a longer turn and bypass it.</li>
<li>If there is no way to bypass it and it doesn't move, wait, keep an eye on it, keep a very safe distance, bang your feet, in most of the cases it would just mind its own business and disappear. No snake <em>likes</em> to be poked with a stick. I believe poking a snake with a stick is part of <em>don'ts</em>, like don't provoke them, don't irritate them. </li>
<li>Most of the time, snakes happily avoid a face-off with any threat whatsoever, not only typically human. They know you are closer, than it being the other way round. So most of the times you would come across one, it's because you entered its hiding place, or habitat. So, even if you don't know what snakes there are in a particular area, it's okay, but you would want know where they usually are so that you can avoid those places. Example: An abandoned mine. </li>

<p>Stay safe. </p>

<p>I am glad that you are willing to know more and asked the question #2: +1 for that.</p>

<p>Unless it is not specified that <em>which</em> rattlesnake it was, you can't tell.
As we all know, rattlesnakes are of different types.
They are further classified into <em>Crotalus</em> (the larger ones) and <em>Sistrurus</em> (smaller ones). Please note that this classification is not based on its physical size. </p>

<p>There are 30 <em>Crotalus</em> species identified, 2 or 3 debated about.
And there are 3 <em>Sistrurus</em> species identified.</p>

<p>Eastern diamondback rattlesnake, Western diamondback rattlesnake, South American rattlesnake, Timber rattlesnake, Red diamond rattlesnake, Mojave rattlesnake are the common <em>Crotalus</em> ones.</p>

<p>The largest of them are usually Eastern or Western Diamond Back ones. Eastern Diamond Back rattlesnakes can grow up to 150 cm (approx 5 ft). Though <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Monroe_Klauber"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Laurence Klauber</a> have documented 7 ft long Eastern Diamond Back rattlesnake. Western Diamond Back rattlesnakes are typically 4-4½ feet long. So that quite normal if you come across a rattlesnake and it is 3½ to 4 feet long, it dangerous.</p>

<p>There is an exceptional case that I would love to tell you about.
<em>Crotalus</em> ones are larger ones, right. Exception: Side Winder. The average adult is 2-2½ ft long. </p>

<p><em>Massasauga</em>, commonly known as Black to Grey Rattlesnake, is a Sistrurus one and can grow up to 2½-2¾ ft. This fellow further has 3 subspecies that I am not going to talk about.</p>

<p>The whole point is, it doesn't matter if a snake is juvenile or grown, a rattlesnake or some other Pit Viper or some Adder which also is a Viper but not a Pit Viper. Gobbledegook?</p>

<p>Stay safe, stay away, Since you can't be assured that a smaller snake is more dangerous or less dangerous. </p>

<p>In this particular case you have talked about, unless I don't know what rattlesnake it was, I can't really say if it was a juvenile or an adult one.</p>

<p>UPDATE: After your edit, you answered it yourself. Grows up to 3 and a half feet. The poor fellow was bitten by an adult Timber Rattlesnake.</p>

"What to look for in a quality tarp?","4353","","<p>I'd like to purchase a tarp as some point, both to put up over a small camp at some point, and to use over a hammock.</p>

<p>When I've camped with my uncle he's used a folded over builders tarp, which has worked so far but I have seen other that have leaked, either 'out of the box' or due to fire damage (hot sparks from a fire causing tiny holes).</p>

<p>What are the characteristics to look out for in a quality tarp, and how can I spot them before I buy them?</p>
","<p>Most tarps have a coating applied to them.  DWR should be avoided, it's only water resistant and will eventually drip.  Silicone impregnated (aka silnylon or sil-nylon) is lighter than polyurethane-coated, and is supposed to be equally waterproof, but some people say silnylon can mist during heavy rains but it's more likely from condensation than permeability.  A tarp that is polyurethane coated will usually have a flame retardant element added to it. Some tarps are coated with both in order to meet flame retardant standards.  Polyurethane coatings are always on the underside, and may peel with time.  Silnylon strengthens the fabric, while polyurethane weakens the fabric over time.</p>

<p>TLDR; If you have money and weight is of importance, go for silnylon, otherwise go for polyurethane.</p>

"What is the difference between a rifle and a shotgun?","4310","","<p>This is one of those things, that seems like it has just always been in my knowledge. A recent comment <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/11797/what-kind-of-shot-is-in-the-shells-i-just-purchased#comment29109_11797"">about rifles on a question about shotguns</a> got me thinking, it really is not all that simple.</p>

<p>They make slugs that you can fire in a shotgun, and they make shot you can fire in a rifle. </p>

<p>If they can both shoot either slugs or shot, is there a difference? Are the names rifle and shotgun interchangeable? If there is a difference what are key points that distinguish them? </p>
","<p>The  term 'rifle' comes from the fact that the barrel of a rifle has spiral grooves (called rifling) cut into the inside. When the bullet is fired  it is forced into these grooves which in turn cause it to spin as it travels down the barrel. This spin around its long axis creates a gyroscopic effect which stabilises it in flight dramatically improving its accuracy and the consistency of its trajectory. </p>

<p>This axial stabilization also means that the bullet can be made with a more aerodynamically efficient shape (typically a cone or cylinder) as it is much less prone to tumbling end over end in flight. </p>

<p>A consequence of this is that a rifle bullet is a tight fit in the barrel and so very little of the gas pressure generated by the propellant can get past it compared to a shotgun and so typically a rifle requires a rather heavier barrel than a shotgun as it must contain greater gas pressures even though a shotgun shell may have a greater mass of propellant. </p>

<p>A shotgun is designed to produce a spread of shot over short to moderate ranges which  makes it easier to hit small fast moving targets, such as small game and especially birds in flight. the limitation is that its stopping power and accuracy decrease quickly with range. </p>

<p>In a military context shotguns have the advantage that they have high stopping power at very short ranges, can hit a target without careful aim* and have a very versatile  selection of rounds for different purposes. They are also particular useful for breeching unarmored doors either with buckshot, solid slugs or specialist breeching rounds there are also specialist rounds for firing gas and pyrotechnic munitions through light doors and walls as well as for shattering windows (relatively) safely.</p>

<p>*In response to comments I will clarify this point by adding that shotguns are well suited to quickly acquiring and hitting fast moving targets of opportunity both because of their spread pattern and general handling characteristics. Here 'careful aim'  was perhaps the wrong choice of words but the point is that they work well for reflexive type shooting styles both in the context of game shooting (eg birds flying from cover) and certain military contexts. This is especially the case over moderate ranges in close terrain (eg dense forest or outdoor urban terrain) shotguns may be a very effective weapon as an initial counter to ambushes or unexpected contact with the enemy at short range. </p>

<p>Solid slugs in shotguns are normally primarily  intended as anti-material  rounds for use against light vehicles etc at fairly close range but they can also be used to improve effective range and accuracy against personnel. </p>

<p>Pump action shotguns also have the advantage that a single round can be loaded and fired very quickly from an unloaded weapon. For all of these reasons shotguns are often used as primary or additional weapons by at least one member of units specializing in close quarters, urban or hostage rescue. </p>

<p>In contrast rifles are accurate and effective at much greater ranges. Although shot rounds for rifles do exist they are pretty rare. </p>

"Which fingers to use in a 2 finger pocket when rock climbing?","4286","","<p>While rock climbing, when crimping a hold, I always use my index finger (and whatever other fingers fit) since I can stack my thumb on top. For two finger pockets is it better to use your index and middle finger or your middle and ring finger (assuming either pair fit).</p>
","<p>For the sake of your tendons, it is better to use your <strong>ring and middle finger</strong> in two finger pockets, because of how your muscles in your forearm insert on your fingers, and how they're wired to your nervous system. </p>

<p>You essentially only have one muscle which acts on <strong>all</strong> of your fingers, called <em>flexor digitorum profundus</em>. This muscle fans out into four tendons which insert on the distal phalanx (finger-tip bone) of each finger. </p>

<p><sup><em>Flexor digitorum profundous, shown in blue:</em></sup><br />
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lIgIY.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lIgIY.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>You have many other muscles in your hand as well, which also act on your fingers in multiple different ways, but when you're pulling hard on your finger tips, it's <em>flexor digitorum profundous</em> which is getting pumped. </p>

<p>What's interesting is that this muscle is innervated by more than one nerve; the medial aspect is innervated by your ulnar nerve, but your lateral aspect is innervated by your median nerve. You can isolate the intervention of these nerves in your middle and pinky fingers, but your ring finger kinda gets caught in between, It's literally impossible to flex either your middle or pinky fingers at the tips without the ring finger at least partially flexing as well, so it's better to pair your ring finger with your middle and flex them together.</p>

<p>Your ring and middle fingers are typically closer to the same length as well, which tends to make it more comfortable to hold in a pocket, you're also more secure in the hold when you can use your forefinger and small finger to stabilize your hand. </p>

<p>Your angle on the pocket while moving past the hold, as well as its size and shape, may make using your forefinger more appropriate, but for the most part, it's better to grab two finger pockets with your middle and ring fingers. </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Party trick:</strong><br />
Demonstrate to people that is it <strong>impossible</strong> to curl any of the fingers on your hand independently other than you forefinger. </p>

<p>First establish that there is a difference between <em>bending</em> a finger and <em>curling</em> a finger. Bending means you're just bending the finger at the first joint past the knuckle, you aren't engaging the fingertip, curling means you are using both the first and second joints, and engaging the fingertip. </p>

<p>Your ring finger is half innervated by the ulnar nerve, and half innervated by other nerves, so if you curl either finger beside your ring finger, your ring finger will curl at least half-curl, if you curl your ring finger, the fingers on either side of it will half curl, if you curl both your middle and small fingers, your ring finger will curl with them, and there is nothing you can do to stop it <em>(except cheat and only bend your finger instead of curling it)</em>. The more force you use, the more your other fingers are going to curl.</p>

"Do mountains really make their own weather, and if so why?","4272","","<p>Forecasts for the mountains generally seem to be somewhere between useless and unreliable. Afternoon thunderstorms, clouds that come out of nowhere, unexpected rain showers, etc... Anyone who has spent some time in the hills has a story or three of getting caught by unexpected weather, and we're always taught to be vigilant and prepared.</p>

<p>Do mountains really make their own weather? Why is that?</p>
","<p>In a sense, yes. While mountains don't literally ""make their own weather,"" they <em>do</em> sometimes provide additional catalysts to create <em>localized disturbances</em> which you might otherwise characterize as ""weather"" (thunderstorms, clouds, rain, etc).</p>

<p>In a broader global sense, weather events occur when masses of air with differing characteristics suddenly collide. When there is a sudden change in things like temperature, pressure, or humidity, it causes moisture to precipitate out of the air (rain) and/or sudden changes in patterns of airflow (wind). </p>

<p>In the typical (non mountain) case, these differing air masses meander around the globe in complex patterns that are at least <em>somewhat</em> predictable over shorter periods of time. Hot moist air is ""far away over there"" but will collide with cooler, dryer air over here within {x} days or so. It's somewhat predicable and reasonably consistent.</p>

<p><strong>Contrast that to the typical meteorological circumstances of a mountainous terrain</strong><br>
You have (typically) a warmer, heavier, moister weather system hanging out down around the base of the mountain. Near by (typically just a few miles away), you have a looming mass of much lighter, cooler, dryer atmosphere sitting right next door. So, essentially, it takes only a small shift in wind to make these two systems suddenly (and unexpectedly)  collide. </p>

"Can you boil/decontaminate water with heat from a magnifying glass?","4251","","<p>A bit hypothetical, but ruling out being able to use a solar still, or the SODIS method, could you make water drinkable by using the suns heat through a magnifying glass?</p>

<p>Paper self ignites at 451° F , water boils at 212° F, but that is at one concentrated point when paper burns using a magnifying glass.

<p>I realize you could then start a fire, and boil water in a metal container but i am just curious if it is possible to heat the water enough to be drinkable without placing it on a fire using this method. As fires cause smoke lets say you are in a less than desirable place where the smoke from a fire could give away your location when you didn't want it to. </p>
","<p>Let's do some back-of-the-envelope calculations.</p>

<p>The specific heat of water is the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of a particular amount of water by 1 degree C. This is 4.186 joules/gram °C <a href=""http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/thermo/spht.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">(reference)</a>. </p>

<p>To raise the temperature of 1 L of water (1000 g) by 80 degrees C (to boiling from room temperature), would be 4.186 * 1000 * 80 = 334,800 joules.</p>

<p>The amount of sunlight falling on a square metre of the earth's surface is at maximum about 300 watts/m² <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_energy"" rel=""noreferrer"">(reference)</a>. A watt is a joule per second, so this means you could get 334,800 joules from a square metre of sunlight in 334,800 / 300 = 1116 seconds, or about 19 minutes.</p>

<p>Of course, a magnifying glass with an area of a square metre would be rather heavy and unwieldy to carry. A largeish one of 9 cm (3.54 inch) diameter would be about 64 cm², or 0.0064 square metres. Using this magnifying glass would boil our 1 litre of water in about 157 times as much time, or about 175,000 seconds, or just over 48 hours.</p>

<p>As you can see, the amount of energy you can collect directly from the sun is insufficient to boil any useful amount of water in a reasonable time. Even if you only wanted a small drink of 100 mL, it would still take all afternoon.</p>

"How to belay on top of a pitch","4198","","<p>When doing a multi-pitch and you reach a belay station (the top of a pitch) you can choose between belaying the lead climber from the body (like you do e.g. indoors where you aren't doing multi-pitches) or from the belay station (anchor) itself.</p>

<p>Can someone experienced please compare those types of belaying? What are pros and cons? What should be preferred in which situation?</p>

<p>I know for example that you have to care if you are using a Tube (e.g. BD ATC Guide or Petzl Reverso) and you are going to belay from the body because the device will fail if the pull of the rope isn't coming from above.</p>
","<p><strong>Belaying Multi-pitch</strong></p>

<p>It's often recommended to belay off the harness (an ""indirect"" belay) when belaying the leader, and off the anchor (a ""direct"" belay) when belaying the follower.   Use of an indirect belay for the leader reduces the force on the anchors, but does require consideration of how the belayer may be pulled in a fall.  Use of a direct belay for the follower similarly minimizes the force on the anchor by avoiding the pulley effect.</p>

<p>When the anchor pieces are extremely solid (e.g. bolts), a direct belay may be desirable in both cases.  Still, do bear in mind that neither setup is mandatory; if a direct belay would place you in an awkward or less secure position then an indirect belay would offer, you should probably use the indirect belay and vice versa.</p>

<p><strong>Belaying the leader</strong></p>

<p>Should the leader fall before placing any protection, and continue falling past the belayer, the direction of pull then comes from below, and so the belayer must reverse their braking direction.  As the belayer may not recognize the implications of this and thus not respond quickly enough, it's common to want to find some way to redirect the rope.  However, an easier way to address this is for the belayer to bring their brake hand around behind their hip, rather than making a habit of braking purely downwards.  Having your hand further from the device when it's locked-off may also reduce rope burns in a high fall factor situation as more rope can slip through the device before it has to also slip through your hand.</p>

<p>If a redirect is still wanted, the leader can do this by clipping the rope into the shelf, master point, or the topmost piece of the anchor, which the belayer may unclip once additional protection has been placed.  Alternatively the belayer could lower themselves a few meters below the anchor.  I've also seen it suggested that the previous leader could climb slightly above the belay station in order to place an initial piece, and descend to build the belay anchor.  (This makes an exception to the ""never back-clip"" rule, as back-clipping this piece lets the rope run the correct direction when the other climber takes the lead.)</p>

<p>Redirecting the belay by clipping the anchor may slightly reduce the fall factor due to the additional rope out.  However, it also means the belayer will be pulled violently into that piece when such a fall happens.  The pulley effect will also multiply the force on the anchor (or the particular piece that was clipped) in contrast to a direct belay.  Thus, unless the clipped piece is solid (e.g. a bolt) and the belayer can also be anchored to prevent them smashing into it, it may be preferable for the leader to simply place good protection soon after leaving the ground rather than clipping the leader's rope into the anchor.[1]  (Of course, if you have an extremely solid anchor, you might also consider a direct belay.)</p>

<p>A strong argument for an indirect belay (off the harness) is that by incorporating the belayer into the system, some of the load on the anchor is shifted to the belayer's stance.  This may be helpful if the quality of the anchor or gear is in question.  If you do use an indirect belay, be mindful of the direction a fall will pull the belayer.  It's also advisable to clip the belay device into both the rope tie-in loop and the belay loop when doing this, in order to prevent discomfort from the harness being twisted in two different directions.[2]  (Clipping the belay loop vs. clipping the tie-in loop is also a way you can further adjust the amount of force going to the anchor.)</p>

<p>On the other hand, a direct belay (off the anchor) will be much easier to escape if something goes wrong, and essentially eliminates the weight of the belayer as a factor in catching falls.  This may be beneficial if the leader significantly outweighs their belayer, but it also means that it's harder to give a ""soft catch"".  It also places significantly higher forces on the anchor and gear.[3]  (Along those same lines, use of a tube-style belay device such as an ATC or Reverso will allow additional rope slippage that further reduces the impact on the anchor.)</p>

"How to overcome fear of falling in lead climbing","4184","","<p>I used to really enjoy climbing (almost all indoors).  I was bouldering around V2-3 and leading at 5+.  The mismatch was all down to fear of falling - I would repeatedly bail or fall from routes that I felt were well within my ability because of it.  It quickly got to the point where it started interfering with my enjoyment of leading.</p>

<p>I'm a cautious kind of person and am happy being limited by my lowish tolerance for risk (that's a decision I take), but the fear is not rational - e.g. I have no fear while clipping the 2nd bolt although a fall here is probably the worst place on an indoor wall to fall.  I get to a point where I'm scared and just freeze - I know the next move but my arms and legs just will not obey so I hang there, get tired and panicked and then either downclimb to the previous bolt or fall off.  What makes it worse:</p>

<ul>
<li>being above a bolt</li>
<li>body weight not above feet (side pull, overhangs)</li>
<li>empty space below me (overhangs, stepping across onto the other side of a dihedral)</li>
<li>dynamic moves</li>
</ul>

<p>I have taken a few falls, but I don't seem to get used to it.  The irony is that I quite enjoy a big fall <em>as soon as I have left the wall</em>.  Up to that point it's all panic and terror and climbing badly.</p>

<p>Any tips on how to overcome this?  Or should I just give in and stick to bouldering and slabs!   <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/5657/learning-to-fall-when-leading-what-is-good-fall-technique"">This question</a> looks similar but covers the techniques for falling safely.  My problem is all in my head.</p>
","<p>Everyone who climbs suffers from this to some degree, so you need to accept that doing this will make you scared. </p>

<p>I've had very similar issues to the one's your describe over the years. I've tried several techniques to help with this with mixed result. From my personal experience the below <strong>didn't work for me</strong> (they may for you)</p>

<ul>
<li>Fall training, i.e. taking a fall deliberately to get used to it.</li>
</ul>

<p>This helps with your fall technique but for me it failed to address the issue. I wasn't scared of taking a controlled fall I was scared that I couldn't hold on while clipping, etc.</p>

<ul>
<li>People shouting encouragement/telling me to get on with it</li>
</ul>

<p>This just annoyed me/made me more frustrated than anything, which made me not want to get into that situation even less, which made me more annoyed at them and me, repeat until I end up shouting at them to simply p**s off and storming away from the crag in a terible mood.. :)</p>

<ul>
<li>Putting pressure on myself to succeed</li>
</ul>

<p>Partly as a result of the above I ended up getting into a mindset that I was just being silly and I should just man up and get on with it. again, for me this simply made the matter worse, to the point where the grade I could lead gradually got worse.</p>

<ul>
<li>Visualisation</li>
</ul>

<p>This is where you visualise the moves and convince yourself you can do it, etc. <strike>Bit too hippy for my liking, I just couldn't do it. :)</strike></p>

<p>Coming back to this question later, I've now started using this more and more. I often find working though moves in my head, thinking about falling, etc. repeatedly desensitises me. So I now use this technique more than I did at the time of writing.</p>

<hr>

<p>Ok so what <strong>did</strong> work for me:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Coming to terms with it</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>You will get scared, that's fine don't fight it just accept it. ""Ok I'm scared, now what"". This helps you think though the panic.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Turn your brain on to fight your chemical response</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Panic/fear is a chemical response to being in a dangerous situation. Your body is flooded with Adrenaline and you go into <em>fight or flight</em> mode. So do you fight or flight? <strong>Well neither</strong> your 10 meters off the ground attached to a rope, <em>neither option is helpful</em>.</p>

<p>You have two options, fall (fine your not bothered by this but ultimately this just releases more adrenaline and makes matters worse) or engage your brain and out think your chemical response. Start concentrating on what's around you, focus on your breathing, get this under control, your safe remember that, where's the next really good hold, I need 5 mins to just get myself in order, try not to down climb but if you do, do it slowly and controlled.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Stay put/stay calm</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Try and wait it out. Don't simply let go and don't down climb. Wait, close your eyes, concentrate on your breathing, wait for the adrenaline to die down to an acceptable level, then continue. Try and hold on at this point (as opposed to letting your belayer ""take""), realise you can probably hold at this point longer than you realise. Rationalise the situation</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Try to turn the negative into a positive</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>So you get scared when you climb and get swamped with Adrenaline?! Isn't this why your doing this? for the buzz? The Adrenaline! Turn the negative into a positive. Next time you get scared, try and enjoy it! I know this can be hard but adrenaline can be pretty enjoyable if you learn to deal with the fight or flight response.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Break the vicious cycle</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>You get frustrated because your not climbing at your ability which make your more anxious which makes you push yourself, which makes matters worse, repeat. STOP, go for a boulder, relax, enjoy yourself, the wall's not going anywhere and you can come back whenever you want. Your supposed to be enjoying this!</p>

<hr>

<p>The above is based on my personal experiences. Different people will react differently to this. You need to find a solution that fits you. </p>

<h2>A nice story</h2>

<p>For me the turning point was when I was trad climbing, outdoors. I was leading an easy(ish) pitch but it was harder/more exposed than I'd expected. I found myself balanced on an arete 3-4m above my next placement which (in my head at least) would never hold a fall. I couldn't take a fall here, I had to get my sh*t together or I could hurt myself (in reality I was probably perfectly safe but I'd worked myself into such a state that I felt in real danger). I sat there slowly praying looking for a placement and not finding one, gradually I started to feel better, </p>

<p><em>""hold on this hold is solid, I could hang here one handed for about a minute easy""</em></p>

<p><em>""Now my legs stopped shaking that foot placement is about the size of my living room""</em></p>

<p>""There's a crack there, why the hell couldn't I see that before?, what's that? a number 10""</p>

<p>""Bloody hell I could hang a mini off of that placement""</p>

<p>It suddenly occurred to me that indoors I would of just let go and become annoyed at myself. But by sticking it out I'd overcome it. I felt awesome at the top and jumped about like an idiot. My girlfriend didn't understand what the fuss was all about, <em>""That was easy?!""</em></p>

<p>Whenever I feel like I'm loosing it I try and remember this situation and how focused I felt once I'd gotten control of my emotions. </p>

"How do I attach a hammock to trees?","4183","","<p>On my next vacation, I will be camping in a tent on a designated campsite. I saw somebody use a hammock for lounging during the day last time, so quickly got a cheap hammock from eBay, with a ""let's see if that works for me"" attitude. </p>

<p>The hammock came, and it is a piece of silk with a spread of ropes on each short end. The ropes are braided together into a loop. I think this might be intended for a specialized hammock stand, but I won't have one, I'm hoping there will be a usable pair of trees in or around the campsite. It is roughly this style: </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vQOLu.jpg"" alt=""hammock type""></p>

<p>How do I attach it to the trees? Can I use any old cord and wrap it around a tree trunk? Won't it slide down? What cord thickness do I need? Are there special knots I should learn? Is there something more convenient than a cord, e.g. some kind of short belt with clasp? (I've seen long ones for fastening kayaks to car roofs, for example). If I want to buy something for this purpose, 1) how is it called, 2) which shop has it, and 3) how do I use it? </p>
","<p>I hang my hammocks using the same slings I use for anchors while climbing, a girth hitch around the the tree is more than sufficient, but wrapping the sling around the tree twice, then tying it with a <strong><a href=""http://www.animatedknots.com/waterknot/"" rel=""noreferrer"">water knot</a></strong> is best. It holds well, it's easy to adjust the height, and it doesn't slip when weighted. The wide surface area of the webbing is better for the tree than cord too, because it doesn't cut into the tree. </p>

<p>You can attach the hammock directly to the anchor using carabiners if the trees are just the right distance apart, or you can use a length of cord to attach the hammock to the anchors by tying a <a href=""http://www.animatedknots.com/bowline/index.php?Categ=boating&amp;LogoImage=LogoGrog.jpg&amp;Website=www.animatedknots.com"" rel=""noreferrer"">bowline</a> or <a href=""http://www.animatedknots.com/fig8follow/index.php?Categ=climbing&amp;LogoImage=LogoGrog.jpg&amp;Website=www.animatedknots.com"" rel=""noreferrer"">figure eight follow through</a> to the hammock, and a <a href=""http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/clove-hitch-carabiner-8129423.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">clove hitch</a> onto a carabiner clipped to the anchor.

"How do I set a top rope anchor?","4163","","<p>When rock-climbing, I need to set up a top-rope anchor so if I fall, it will minimize chance of injury.</p>

<p>So, how would I safely set one up?</p>
","<p><strong>First</strong> - Please do not <strong>only</strong> rely on answers in this site for creating top rope anchors. This is something that your life depends on, or the life of someone you care about, take it seriously.</p>

<ul>
<li>Seek the advice of an expert in person: At the local climbing gym, or guiding service. </li>
<li>Creating climbing anchors is <strong>not</strong> something you learn simply by reading, you must do this through experience and practice. </li>
<li>If in doubt... <strong>don't trust it</strong>, there is a lot of shady climbing bolts and anchors out there, skepticism is the name of the game. </li>
<li>Seek local knowledge of a climbing area before trusting existing anchors </li>
</ul>

<p>Now with that our of the way...</p>

<p>Use the following acronym as a guide to anchor creation. </p>

<p><strong>E.A.R.N.E.S.T.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Equal</strong> tension - Multipoint anchors must have equal tension on all anchor points. </p>

<p><strong>Angles</strong> appropriate - No angle of tension shall exceed 60 degrees</p>

<p><strong>Redundant</strong> - No single anchor point failure shall cause the entire anchor to fail. Also no anchor point should share a primary connection to any other anchor point.</p>

<p><strong>Non-Extending</strong> - No anchor point failure will cause other load points to be shock loaded.</p>

<p><strong>Strong</strong> - Each individual anchor point could hold all climbers in the case of the worst possible fall </p>

<p><strong>Timely</strong> - The anchor can be constructed and decontructed in a matter of time which does not cause a safety risk in itself.</p>

<p>Also John Long, the grandaddy of modern rock climbing has suggested the alternate acronym to use for mnemonics. </p>

<p><strong>S.R.E.N.E.</strong></p>

"How resistant to water is Tyvek in practice","4157","","<p>Tyvek is labeled as ""water resistant"" and not ""water proof"", but I'd really love to know <em>how much</em> is the fabric resistant to water in practice.</p>

<p>Some people built tarps or even tents out of it, but I was not able to find any tests result of the actual water resistance of the fabric - or better, of the fabric<em>s</em>, since there's more than one version of it.</p>

<p>Is there any information about how much rain could a tyvek sheet actually take before starting to leak? Did anybody made any tests? Thank you so much.</p>

<p>EDIT.
Thank you so much for those values, I missed them. But still, can you please describe how do those numbers relate to actual outdoors (that means, rain) practice? For instance, is ""15"" a light rain for about one hour? Is ""1016"" comparable to heavy rain for several hours non stop? I'd love to get an idea in simple terms of rain if that's somewhat possible and if anybody has an experience with it.</p>
","<p>As you stated in your question, there are many different Tyvek fabrics, some are only water resistant, whereas others are completely waterproof (such as is used for express mail envelopes and printing materials). There are lots of forums online that discuss the use of Tyvek tarps for backpacking, to determine how water resistant your fabric is you need to know <em>which</em> fabric you have.</p>

<p>Rain resistance is measured and expressed as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_head"" rel=""nofollow"">hydrostatic head</a> in millimetres (mm). This indicates the pressure of water needed to penetrate a fabric. Heavy or wind-driven rain has a higher pressure than light rain. Standing on a groundsheet increases the pressure on any water underneath. Fabric with a hydrostatic head rating of 1000 mm or less is best regarded as shower resistant, with 1500 mm being usually suitable for summer camping. Tents for year-round use generally have at least 2000 mm; expedition tents intended for extreme conditions are often rated at 3000 mm. Where quoted, groundsheets may be rated for 5000 mm or more.</p>

"How do you tie in to the centre of a rope?","4139","","<p>Suppose you're leading a short pitch (20-30m) and you have two followers, or you want to double rope the route, and want to simply half your rope and tie into the centre, pulling the two halves up behind you. What's the best way to tie the centre of the rope into your harness?</p>

<p><strong><em>EDIT:</strong> For clarification, I'd prefer a method that does not incorporate having to use a carabiner to attach to the rope.</em></p>
","<p>The easiest way is to tie a fixed loop in the middle of the rope (figure 8, alpine butterfly, bowline on a bight, etc) and then clip the climber in to that loop using two locking carabiners. Two carabiners are used here in order to avoid the scenario of a single carabiner rotating into a cross-loaded orientation during a fall and failing as a result.</p>

<p>However, my preferred method is to tie in directly to the rope, with no additional carabiners, using a bowline on a bight. This can be achieved by tied the knot using a long bight that can be passed over the climber's entire body instead of just being passed over the rest of the knot. This gives you a bowline on a bight tie-in with a very large loop, which you can feed back through the knot to reduce the size of the loop before climbing. You then need to expand the loop afterwards before untying. Those who don't know how to tie or visually inspect and verify a bowline on a bight should not attempt this, as incorrectly tying the knot can easily result in a knot (or lack thereof) that is of inadequate security or even completely insecure.</p>

<p>Another method for those more familiar with the figure-8 is to tie a figure 8 loop in a bight, just in the rope, not yet attached to the climber, making the loop large enough to fit over the climber's entire body. Then tie this into the climber's harness using a cow hitch (AKA lark's foot or girth hitch), by passing the figure-8 loop though the tie-in loops and then over the climber's whole body. This gives you a cow hitch tie in (which alone is insecure) backed up with a figure-8. The backup 8 will initially be way to far down the rope, due to its loop initially having been tied large enough to fit over the climber's body, but you can easily feed rope through to snug the figure 8 down against the cow hitch. As with the bowline version, you need to feed rope back through the knot to expand it before you can untie.</p>

<p>Edit: Images, as requested.</p>

"Can I use one helmet for both kayaking and skiing?","4105","","<p>I am doing little kayaking and just a bit more skiing (the seasons for both are very short where I live). Both of these need helmets, but I feel reluctant to buy 2 items, each of which will see little use.</p>

<p>So I wonder whether I can buy 1 helmet that will be sufficiently safe (but not necessarily convenient) for both activities.</p>

<p>My thoughts so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>A kayaking helmet must be sturdy enough and protect the ears and the back of the head. I see no contradiction with skiing.</li>
<li>A kayaking helmet must have holes. No problem for skiing.</li>
<li>A skiing helmet should protect from cold. However, I don't really need this - it's never too cold where I am skiing.</li>
<li>I am not proficient enough in all the details, so I am afraid to miss some important considerations.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, how can I choose a kayaking helmet that is also suitable for skiing? Or vice versa?</p>
","<p>As the protection required in these activities differ, there are different standards for helmets: EN 1385 for kayaking and EN 1077 for skiing. There are of course even more norms for other helmets. So technically, you need a helmet that fulfils both these norms. I am not aware of a helmet that has both norms. I do however use a Kong Scarab, which fulfils the norms for kayaking, cycling, horse riding and climbing and I do use it for spring ski touring (due to lots of ventilation). I am confident that a helmet that can protect me in a cycling crash can handle a skiing crash too. So in the end it is also a personal assessment whether a certain helmet is actually appropriate, where the norms it fulfils are good indicators of its capabilities.</p>

"In cold conditions, will you freeze faster wearing wet clothes than not wearing any?","4062","","<p>I have heard that in cold conditions, you'd freeze faster wearing wet clothes than not wearing any. I cannot find any proof that this is true. Is it?</p>
","<p>This depends on the actual type of clothing and mostly on the wind speed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The wind evaporates moisture from the body. Since evaporation is a cooling process and absorbs latent heat away from the body, the person feels colder. Skin always has moisture on it. Just like a tree transpires, the human body is constantly having water evaporated from it. Wind intensifies this process. A hot day with a breeze will feel more comfortable than a hot day with calm wind. Wind and evaporative cooling are closely linked. The higher the wind, the greater the amount of evaporative cooling, especially if air is dry.</p>

"How to walk silently in the woods?","4052","","<p>Today I walked in the woods and it was quite late in the evening. While I was walking, a deer jumped and ran away. I guess I disturbed it while it was sleeping. And it came to my mind that I'm the only one who is making some noise at this hour.  </p>

<p>So my question is:  </p>

<ul>
<li>What is the best way to become like a ghost, in respect to shoes, clothes, walking technique etc?  </li>
</ul>

<p>I'm interested in how hunters (not modern ones) prepared for the silent hunt with primitive weapons.</p>
","<p>When I was a boy I learned about a tribe of natives (Lipan Apache) that had an initiation into manhood which involved plucking a hair from the tail of a live deer. These people had developed a mode of stealth that allowed them to walk right up to deer–head on–without the deer sensing their presence or noticing their advance. I adopted the technique for moving through the woods silently, but never to the point where I could stealthily touch a deer. </p>

<p>I'll skip the masking your scent and disguising your appearance parts and just give you the silent walking part.</p>

<p>First of all, you must have good balance, so take a semi-squat stance to lower you body weight. With each step, you will balance on one foot, while you test the ground ahead of you with the smallest toe of your other foot. You want to plant your foot where it isn't going to make any noise, first touch the ground with your small toe, using it to part the grass or move leaves, then gently rock onto your lateral arch down to your heel as you shift your weight onto your forward foot and flatten it out onto the ground, the last part of your foot to touch the ground is your big toe. Complete the step by transferring all your weight to your forward foot, then feel ahead with the other.</p>

<p>The deer touchers did this very slow, averaging about 80 seconds per step, in a breeze they could rock with the grass and branches and go about 60 seconds a step. The super slow speeds were so the deer wouldn't register them moving, even if they were staring straight in their direction. </p>

<p>When nothing's watching you you can move quickly through the woods stepping this way, just touch with your small toe first and ease into each step, when you get good you tend to <em>glide</em> more than you stride. The part to practice is making contact with the ground without making a crunch, it's easy to do on a path, but harder to do when moving through the bush.</p>

<p>As far as what clothes and shoes to wear: the deer touchers went barefoot and wore nothing but a loincloth and ash from a fire, but any soft soled shoe will work for foot wear, toeshoes would be the best. For clothing you don't want to wear anything synthetic, nylon and polyester make that whishing sound when you walk. Soft cotton or wool is best for moving silently, think ninja knickers, light and breathable.</p>

"What do I do to prevent and treat frostbite?","4049","","<p>I'm going to be winter camping, and I'm concerned about getting frostbite. What can I do to protect myself?</p>
","<p>It is <em>much</em> better to avoid frostbite than to treat it. You can easily lose fingers and toes to frostbite. When you are camping in the winter, you cannot go into the lodge and warm up like you do snow skiing. You should really pay attention to frostbite.</p>

<p>If it is much below freezing and you have numb fingers or toes, you should take some kind of action. If you have more clothes, use them. Chemical foot or hand heating packs work well and can prevent frostbite. You can warm your fingers or toes on someone else's stomach. You might be able to move around a lot and warm up your fingers or toes.</p>

<p>When your body starts getting cold, it reduces circulation to your extremities (fingers and toes) and they get cold. If you can warm up your whole body, it will warm your fingers and toes.</p>

<p>You can also get frostbite on your face if you leave it exposed to the wind. Your face warms up easier than your fingers and toes, though. If you have any numb spots on your cheeks, ears, or nose, warm them up. You can also see fresh frostbite on a face -- it's usually kind of white colored.</p>

"Trail gun for protection against bears","4038","","<p>Choosing a trail gun is proving more challenging than I would like. </p>

<p><em>What handgun calibres are powerful enough to provide some protection against aggressive  bears?</em></p>

<p>I want something manageable enough for a smaller framed shooter ( whether that be a younger shooter, a female shooter or like me a shorter guy... 5'7"" ).</p>
","<p>The short answer is ""bear spray""; a firearm is really not the most effective option.  That said...</p>

<p>I will assume you are looking for grizzly protection, since you didn't specify the bear and black bears are relatively shy.  Again, using spray is a far more effective way of improving your odds; a review of its use in Alaska found a 98% success rate, with no fatalities.  On the other hand, bringing or using a firearm does not appear to do anything to improve your odds in a bear encounter.</p>

<p>This is likely due to a number of factors, one being that most people's aim goes totally to pieces under stress, another being that the animal is, well, a bear.  On all fours it's nearly as tall as you are, it outweighs you by several hundred pounds, it's faster than most residential speed limits, and unlike many humans it doesn't freeze up or faint when shot in a non-vital area.</p>

<p>However, since you ask, a .44 Magnum with 240 grain bullets is considered sufficient, assuming you can place your shots on target and learn to handle the recoil.  (Ok, yes, this does fall into the ""hand cannon"" category.)</p>

<p>Given your question, I assume you are not qualified as ""expert"" in terms of shooting ability.  This means that if you want to be effective you will need to put in a great deal of time at the range, hopefully with a good instructor so you develop proper habits.  (A good goal is 3"" groups at 25 yards.)</p>

<p>I would also strongly recommend the Herrero book below, to better understand bear behavior.</p>

"Should I eat when I don't have anything to drink in a survival situations?","4032","","<p>I've had a pretty interesting discussion beneath <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/13356/is-it-a-good-idea-to-drink-blood-to-avoid-dehydration"">this survival question</a>. A <a href=""http://www.outdoorlife.com/blogs/survivalist/survival-skills-5-myths-dehydration"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">source given in the answer</a> to this question states that you shouldn't eat when dehydration can become or is a problem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(...) (A) simple rule(:) If you have nothing to drink, then do not eat.
  Eating anything, even watery foods, takes water from your system to
  create the slurry that will be able to move through your GI tract.
  Eating without drinking can lead to constipation, or worse, an
  intestinal blockage. If you are suffering from dehydration, and have
  watery foods available try squeezing out the liquid through a cloth.
  I’ll often do this with summer berries to create a drink. Blueberries,
  raspberries, blackberries, and other watery wild edibles can be mashed
  and squeezed to make a juice that offers hydration and even a few
  calories and vitamins, without wasting the water it would take to pass
  all those skins and seeds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, I'm a little bit skeptical if this rule of thumb really applies. Also my discussion partner disagreed with this statement. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don't believe that's true. (...) So any water your body happens to
  add plus any water contained in the food will be reabsorbed in your
  large intestine, the net result being a water gain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, is it true to say: ""If you have nothing to drink, then do not eat.""?</p>
","<p>In a survival situation without water you will die in days and without food you will die in weeks. So in general, there is no need to eat in a survival situation. That said, the quick burst of energy you can gain from eating a surgery snack could make all the difference (e.g., a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharknado"">sharknado</a>).</p>

<p>There is probably little harm eating a little after one day without water. Your body will still have enough ""water"" to be able to digest food. Your body will also be in the process of conserving water so the amount of water lost in your stool will be limited. If you manage to live for 4 days without water, you probably should avoid eating as your body may not have enough water to digest the food. Again, a sugary snack might still be helpful in a sharknado.</p>

<p><strong>What is the harm in eating</strong></p>

<p>The chemical reactions for breaking down carbohydrate and fat are different. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis"">Hydrolysis</a> is the process by which the chemical bonds in the carbohydrate are broken with the addition of water. The water is ""destroyed"" in hydrolysis. Dehydration synthesis (a type of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensation_reaction"">condensation reaction</a> is used to breakdown fat. This process ""creates"" water.</p>

<p>This means that in extreme situations, ignoring sharknados and the such, you want to be using fat for energy. Since our body does not store much carbohydrate, in survival situations your body will rely on fat (and to a limited extent on protein). If you are going to eat and you have a bag of sugar and a stick of butter, go with the butter.</p>

<li>Fold edges into the wall dimensions (folded edge <strong>under not over</strong> the tarp.)</li>
<li>Make sure no edges extend beyond the rain fly</li>

<h2>Place waterproof tarp <strong>inside tent</strong></h2>

<ol>
<li>Purchase a good quality waterproof tarp slightly larger than tent footprint dimensions.</li>

<li>Place tarp in the tent, and fold edges to wall dimensions (fold so that <strong>edge is over</strong>, not under the tarp) </li>

<p><hr>
The reason for the difference is that no matter how hard you try, in all but bitter cold conditions you will have some melting of the snow under your tent. This invariably gets onto the tarp surface and makes the tent floor wet, or icy. </p>

<p>I have never purchased an aftermarket tent floor, because they are overpriced and can be easily made following the steps above.</p>

<p>If you are ambitious you can create a custom floor by cutting, and melting the tarp edges. Then re-grommeting the tarp so that it can be independently staked to the ground. This I have found is usually unnecessary for all but the most fickle travelers.</p>

<p>The problem answering the question in a more straight forward manner you have waterfalls like victoria falls (pictured below) that would almost certainly result in a fatal fall if you were to go over, but the chance of flushing over even when on the edge of the waterfall are low because of the depth and flow at the lip. </p>

<p>In an emergency type scenario ropes can be helpful to mitigate risks, but require careful application as they add complexity to a potentially dangerous situation. Again experience goes a long way. </p>

<p>I'd also be interested to know about the historical usage of different methods if known.</p>
","<p>You can cook meat on a wooden skewer, piecing it like a kebab, and turning it frequently to prevent burning and to allow it to cook evenly. Similarly you can do this with two sticks and have the meat tied between the two. This is useful for smaller chunks, but becomes difficult with larger ones. You also will have to take care with dripping fat which can spit in the flames.</p>

<p>In the same way meat can be spit roasted, but you would have to prepare a spit out of logs for this which could be too excessive.</p>

<p>You can also cook meats on a heated rock, which is a technique still used in restaurants today for steak cooking. This should be easy enough if you have prepared a fire ring. A flat clean rock is best, and you can take the rock out of the fire to prevent spitting or over cooking.</p>

<p>You can leaf wrap the meat and cook it over coals (I saw this on TV done with a deer, over heated coals and covered by sand / dirt) and leave it for a few hours. - I'm almost certain I saw this on Time Team, but can't remember the era.

<li><p>Better strength*/diameter ratio.  550lb paracord is 5/32"" (4mm) in diameter generally.  Twisted poly of a comparable strength is around 3/16"" (4.75mm).  So the paracord will pack smaller.</p></li>

"Snake on chest while sleeping?","3993","","<p>Now, this is not very common, however I have heard it enough times from people to know that it actually does happen.</p>

<p>When sleeping in the open or in an open tent (yes, i know you shouldn't), snakes can 'crawl' up on you due to the heat that you emit. I know of a few cases from friends of mine in which the snake was on top of the sleeping bag on the chest/stomach area. I don't know if that is usual practice or just accident. And both stories they got rid of it by either notifying other members of group, which took care of it, or by removing it by hand.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a safer, more intelligent way to remove the snake from your chest?</strong></p>

<p>And I know that you should avoid this situation all together, however if you've missed something out, you might wake up to that. What do you do?</p>
","<p>If you end up with a snake on your chest while sleeping, you can rest assured that the snake is not in an aggressive mood. It's on top of you because it thinks you're cozy and warm, if it's cozy then it's going to be pretty mild tempered. I imagine you could easily grab it behind the head and take it out of your tent. If you don't want to touch it, just flip the top of your sleeping bag over it, get out of your bag, gather it up, then go shake your bag out away from your tent. Snakes only strike when they feel threatened, if a snake is getting snuggly with you, then it obviously doesn't feel threatened. The most important thing to do would be to remain calm and don't make any sudden movements that might startle the snake, chances are good that it could be asleep, the next most important thing to determine is <em>what kind of snake is it</em>? You only need to worry about it if it's poisonous. </p>

<p>One way to prevent snakes from slithering up to you is to clear away everything on the ground around where you're sleeping. Snakes don't typically like to slither out into exposed areas, so if you clear away all the leaves, sticks and grass then the snakes may just stick to the shrubs and go around you. Sleeping in a hammock or off the ground some other way is also advantageous in preventing this kind of critter encounter.</p>

<p>Your situation could be worse. My aunt was camping alone one time and a big black bear found her and snuggled up to her in the middle of the night, it laid down right on the zipper of her sleeping bag, trapping her there. She had no choice but to wait it out. After a long night of loud bear-snores the bear eventually woke up and just wandered off. My experience with snakes is that they typically want to get away from you, if I had a snake on me I'd probably just bat it off and away from under the bag and roll away from it, chances are good it'll be like, ""Holy crap that was a living thing I was on!"" and just slither away back into the bushes.</p>

I've seen suggestions of using paraffin in conjunction with other materials as a firestarter, so it seems like paraffin-coated paper could be really useful, as well as really easy and cheap to acquire and bring with you anywhere (plus it's somewhat waterproof).  However, I've never really seen any mention of it before.</p>

<p>I'll probably try some experiments with it later, but was wondering if there were other thoughts on the matter.  It might not even be possible; after all, it seems like some wax papers might be meant to go in the oven without burning (and I'm not talking about parchment paper).</p>
","<p>Just got around to trying out some experiments, and so far it seems to be pretty robust.  In most of the things I've tried, it lit immediately and was consumed entirely, no need to re-light (except for the wet test, I'll mention below).  I used a lighter, so I can't be certain other methods (flint, bow, etc.) will ignite it as well, but given how quickly it lit they might not be much different.</p>

<ul>
<li>Loose crumpled ball: Burns quickly, all gone in about 15 seconds.</li>
<li>Folded into a tight square: Burns very slowly but steadily.  Took (approximately) five minutes to burn out.  This seemed pretty optimal for starting a fire.</li>
<li>Folded into a tight square, soaked in water for a while: After squeezing out most of the moisture, it seemed somewhat dry so I tried to light it.  It lit but wouldn't stay lit.  I unfolded it and let it sit to dry for a couple minutes, then refolded it.  After that, it lit and burned pretty much the same as the dry folded test.</li>
<li>Crumpled in a ball for a while: Pretty much the same as the tight square, though it might've lasted slightly shorter and burned with a larger flame.</li>
<li>Folded and kept on top of a warm oven for a while: Doesn't seem to have run or melted; it didn't stick to or run into the paper towel it was tucked inside.  Discolored from the heat but lit and burned without any problem.</li>
<li>Folded in my wallet: Going to just leave it in there for a while and see if it affects how it lights.  By this point I'm assuming it won't have much of a problem, but I'll update this if it has any effect.  EDIT: It's been a while, but as I recall, the paper that had been left in my wallet for a few weeks basically worked the same as fresh paper.  Overall effects might vary based on brand and pocket temperature, but it seems a viable way of storing some emergency fire starter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other notes are that the tightness that it's folded affects how much ash is left behind; if it's folded lightly, it all but disappears, but the tightly folded square leaves a significant chunk of ash behind.  I wasn't able to detect any chemical or plastic smells while it was burning, but that doesn't really guarantee for me that it's not making any toxic fumes so I figure it's safer to avoid inhaling around it while it's lighting.  The brand itself may matter -- for all this I used Reynolds.</p>

"Backpacking Through Rain","3990","","<p>My friends and I are setting off on a hike this Friday through Michigan's UP. I've been watching the forecast which, to be fair, is never accurate in Michigan. Nonetheless, it shows a good amount of rain. We have been planning this for a little over 3 months now, and already have the time taken off work so moving the trip isn't possible.</p>

<p><strong>What precautions should you take when going on a backpacking trip around the length of one week?</strong></p>

<p>We are water-proofing our bags and tents tonight, and all of our food are in safe containers to keep that dry as well.</p>

<p><strong>How would we dry wet clothes, if need be?</strong></p>

<p>I don't think cold will be too much of an issue during the day - it should be in the mid 70's consistently, but at night it can get down pretty low (40 is normal, could be lower).</p>

<p><strong>If we need to dry clothes/towels/bags/etc WHILE it is raining, what methods are best?</strong></p>

<p>This may not even be possible. We may just be stuck avoiding getting our clothing wet, which shouldn't be much of an issue.</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>What precautions should you take when going on a backpacking trip
  around the length of one week?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Build a rough route card, <strong>where</strong> you plan to be and <strong>when</strong>. Give it to someone you trust who will keep track of you. That way if you get into serious trouble and can't get help yourself there will be someone to raise the alarm. Better than lying in a ditch with no hope of rescue...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How would we dry wet clothes, if need be?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A fire is a good option here, if you get the fire nice and hot (and your in an area where fires are appropriate, i.e. fire pits, etc.) you can hang your clothes out on branches near the fire to dry (careful no to set fire to your clothes and don't do this with anything with a low melting point, GoreTex, etc). It'll also keep you warm. Your clothes may well get smokey but after a week of not washing you likely won't notice that :)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If we need to dry clothes/towels/bags/etc WHILE it is raining, what

<p>Your going to struggle here, I would always keep a dry set of clothes. Keep these sealed in a bag and only put them on when you can stay dry. That way, if you can't dry out your day clothes at least you've got some dry night clothes to wear. though putting the wet one's back on in the morning will be unpleasant...</p>

"What should one do when get a cramp while swimming?","3977","","<p>I'm not a really good swimmer. While swimming casually, when I get a cramp in my thighs or toes, it definitely makes me panic a bit and hampers my swimming in a bad way.</p>

<p>What should I be doing if I get a cramp when I am swimming?</p>
","<h1>Survival Float.</h1>

<p>A <strong>survival float</strong>-also know as a <strong>deadman float</strong> or <strong>jellyfish float</strong>–is when you relax your body, over-inflate your lungs, and try to stay afloat using natural buoyancy by either laying out on your back or your front. On your front you obviously need to come up for air regularly, but on your back you can relax and just focus on your breathing and relaxing the cramp. I know people that are so buoyant they can actually fall asleep and take naps floating on their backs on lakes.</p>

<p>A couple of summers ago I agreed to swim across a lake with my much more fit cousin. I tried keeping up with her for the first bit, but just past half way across I got a wicked cramp in my side. I was in the very middle of a lake so I had no choice but to keep on going. How I coped with the cramp was to first change my stroke (freestyle, to breast stroke, to side stroke, to back stroke). Eventually I had to stop kicking my legs and focus as hard as I could at relaxing the muscles where I was cramping. When the cramp got real bad, I ended up on my back in a survival float using gentle figure eight wrist motions to keep me moving towards shore. </p>

<hr>

<p>@Sherwood Botsford shared a very specific survival floating technique in the comments called <a href=""http://www.drownproofing.com/"">drownproofing</a>. It's very similar to a deadman float except you are vertical and <em>under</em> the surface of the water, only using very gentle motions to just bring your mouth to the surface every 10-12 seconds for a new breathe of air. </p>

"How to dry wet shoes quickly?","3972","","<p>Is there a way to dry the shoes out when they get wet? I am referring to situations specially when I can not hang them out to dry.<br>
Consider a situation wherein I am trekking in the night, and I need to cross a stream and then I know that I am not gonna walk much through wet places (mud, grass lands, etc), but I am gonna walk for sure. So is there a way to dry them out faster? So that I don't get blisters.
Had this been a daytime I could simply hang them out in the sun for a while when I plan to have lunch or rest for half an hour or so..</p>
","<p>Consider whether you really need to have dry shoes before going thru all the trouble.  In the winter, wet footwear can be a serious problem.  However, when it's warm out there is really no danger from wet shoes.  The only issue may be that you simply don't like the feel of it.</p>

<p>In situations where its warm enough and there is no real danger from wet shoes, keeping the shoes dry is not necessarily the best answer.  Here in New England, trails regularly have wet areas when they aren't frozen.  The way I often deal with this is to decide up front that I simply don't care if my shoes get wet.  It's actually quite liberating to not worry about it.  It makes getting thru wet areas and crossing stream much easier.</p>

<p>There are a few things that help make this work, mostly being the right shoes and the right socks.  I use shoes with cloth uppers that therefore breath easily, and fairly thick wool socks.  Thick wool socks versus thin cotton or other synthetic make a huge difference.  With this setup it's really not uncomfortable at all to walk in wet shoes.  You don't get that sloppy squishy feeling, and I've never gotten blisters or felt any rubbing due to the wetness.</p>

<p>On the plus side, you feel much freer to just walk around anywhere.  You stop worrying about getting wet, finding ways around large puddles in the middle of the trail, when the beavers have flooded the road with 2 inches of water, crossing streams, etc.  All around it makes for more enjoyable hiking.</p>

<p>I know this may sound somewhat unintuitive, but give it a try before just assuming this makes no sense for you.</p>

"How to get kinks and twists out of a climbing rope?","3931","","<p>One complaint about using the Munter hitch for belaying is that it twists and kinks the rope. After doing a full rope length rappel with a Munter hitch down a slightly overhanging face to the base of the climb, what is the best way for a pair of climber to get the twists and kinks out of the climbing rope (you can assume the rope is still hanging from the anchors and the climbers are standing on a wide open and secure area).</p>
","<p>Good grief.  The question was about getting the kinks out, not the merits of the Munter (which is invaluable, see  David Fasulo's <em>Self Rescue</em>).</p>

<p>The <strong>best</strong> option, while on the rock, esp. if it is a nice day, is to hang your rope from one end, and slightly weight the other (to keep it from blowing around, tangling in trees, whatever).  If you have a swivel (e.g. like you would use on a haul bag), you can use that to connect the rope to any anchor and tension the rope (this can be in a parking lot, just be sure that the car you tie it to is your own).  Both of these will gently uncoil the rope.</p>

<p>Another option is to do an old-fashioned mountaineers coil and just make sure you are twisting the rope in the correct direction.</p>

"Wood versus plastic trail signs?","3929","","<p>My town (Groton MA, USA) has 110 miles of trails open to the public, but virtually no signs helping people navigate at intersections in the woods.  I am on the Trails Committee, and I'm pushing hard to address this.</p>

<p>Initially I figured we'd just do whatever other organizations do that have been at this for a long time.  Just about all backwoods trail signs I've ever seen have been simple routed wood.  It seems the US forest service has been using this type of sign for many decades, perhaps a century.  For example:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/oIa09.jpg"" alt=""""></p>

<p>This happens to be from the Tonto National Forest in AZ.  It's about as typical a trail sign as there is in the US.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CMuzS.jpg"" alt=""""></p>

<p>This one is on the top of Mt Lafayette in the White Mountain National Forest of NH.  Again, it's basically the same design.  The sign at top was recently replaced, and I'm not sure if it is more yellow due to being newer and not weathered yet (this location is above treeline open to the sky all year), or whether it's the new ""composite"" material that is plastic and wood.</p>

<p>Presumably the Forest Service has looked into this and converged on something that works and has low lifetime cost.  If it's good enough for the US Forest Service, it's good enough for me.</p>

<p>However, we have had several people pushing us to use newer plastic material that is claimed to last longer than wood, although its also much more expensive.  The main body of the plastic is white, but the front has a layer of dark green on it.  Routing lines into it cuts thru the front layer to expose the back, so you get white letters on dark green.  I've seen these signs and they are quite readable.</p>

<p>The question is, do you know of any experience with different materials for trail signs?  Are most wood because that's all that's been available until now?  Are there organizations that are using newer materials where they would have used wood signs in the past?  If so, is there any longevity data, lifetime cost data, etc?</p>

<p>Also, any opinions on the esthetics?  If you were hiking the back woods of a small town in New England and came accross non-traditional trail signs, would you think <i>Yuk, this high-tech stuff doesn't belong in the woods</i>, or <i>Cool, these guys are keeping up with the times</i>, or something else?</p>

<h2>Added about plastic signs</h2>

<p>I didn't have a picture of the type of plastic sign I described, so I took one yesterday afternoon:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kK9YR.jpg"" alt=""""></p>

<p>This sign is by the side of a road, so is larger than what would be in the woods.  However, this is the material I was mentioning.  Apparently it is also available in brown.  I have been told that this material will last much longer than wood, and is supposed to be able to stand up to long term UV exposure.</p>

<p>I have meanwhile heard back from one sign maker with some good arguments against pressure treated wood.  That and Karen's point about not knowing what volunteer resources might be available in the future to replace worn signs has me leaning towards a format like the wood signs shown above, but using the plastic material shown here.</p>
","<p>As a New Englander who hikes a lot, I’d say that the sight of any good signage is so startling and unexpected that the appearance of the material should be a distant secondary concern to the signs’ utility. </p>

<hr>

<p>There are a few things to consider that you haven’t mentioned:</p>

<h2>How long will you be on this trail committee?</h2>

<p>Are you likely to have other board members in the future who are enthusiastic enough about signage to upkeep what you put out? Its very, very common to find trails that were last marked 10 or 20 years ago, but with no-one directly responsible for upkeep, or the responsible person being overworked, updating marking falls by the wayside, and you’re left back where you started with unmarked trails. If theft isn’t a concern, I’d go with the longest lasting sign you can afford for this reason alone.  I’ve never worked for a group involved in trailwork that wasn’t hurting for both money and labor, but putting up expensive signs takes just as much time as putting up cheap ones, and if you can’t count on people willing and able to replace them, make sure they rarely need to be replaced.</p>

<h2>How likely is it that signs will be stolen?</h2>

<p>If you have attractive signs, some people will see them as fair game to carry off and use for décor, especially if the sign has interesting words, or a common name (Johnson Hill, for example).  It’s an ironic problem, but very real.  It means a great deal of extra labor and expense, and the more costly the signs are, the more expensive the problem. </p>

<h2>Are the signs going to constantly in the shade, or in a swamp?</h2>

<p>In either case, wooden signs can potentially have a much shorter life than expected because of damp.  Will you need to use chemically treated wood to keep them from getting covered in moss and rotting? If so, I’d lean towards plastic in these cases, because the lifespan of wood can drop from a couple of decades to less than one.</p>

<h2>Have you considered Metal?</h2>

<p>And another potential sign material is etched metal. When I worked in the desert, these were the only signs that could stand up to decades of direct desert sunlight. I’m not sure if they were aluminum or stainless steel. </p>

<h2>Ambiguity</h2>

<p>Another consideration for signs is ambiguity of placement. For example, the sign you posted for Mt Washington is pointing to at least 15 destinations in at 4 directions. I haven’t tried to use that sign in particular, but I’ve often had difficulties at intersections where one sign tries to tell everything.</p>

<p>You end up spending 10 minutes discussing which direction Snooky’s Nook is in, or is that direction actually Bartman’s trail, which you know goes 5 miles out of your way (or more).  If you can put maps at main intersections, the more directionally challenged hikers will love you. Baring that, put signs 10-20 feet away from the intersection, on the trail, if you want to be really unambiguous about what is where.</p>

<hr>

<h1>A few alternatives</h1>

<p>I’m also going to suggest a few alternatives to written signs.</p>

<p>Have you considered alternatives like blazing trees on the most popular trails? Painted blazes do need to be repainted every few years, but if you do other trail maintenance, the additional effort isn’t too bad. The Blue Hills outside of Boston uses coded blazes painted onto trees, combined with small numbers at trail intersections. They’re more urban than you, so theft is a greater concern, but I really like their solution. The numbers are unobtrusive, but at the same time are unattractive enough to not encourage theft. However, what makes this work exceptionally well is that they have very good, very easily available maps that hikers can buy (leave money in a box on the honor system). I don’t know if you’d have the resources to create the high quality maps for distribution, and keeping maps in stock is something most organizations fail at.  The more access points, the harder it becomes.</p>

<p>Another good color coded trail system is at Noon Hill in Medway, run by the Trustees of the Reservation. It’s part of the Charles River Reservation. They have color coded trails and maps on pedestals at main intersections.  It might be less practical with over 100 miles of trail than with their 10-15 miles, but I love running across maps when I’m hiking in unfamiliar areas.</p>

"What is the correct way to attach an autoblock to your harness for rappelling?","3923","","<p>When rappelling and using an autoblock consisting of a french prusik knot it seems there may be some options on how and where to attach the autoblock to my harness.  </p>

<p>Is there a correct placement on the leg loop to attach the autoblock?  </p>

<p>Is there a correct orientation for the carabiner?</p>
","<p><strong>Leg loop verses main belay loop</strong></p>

<p>You'll find recommendations for placing an autoblock on either the leg loop or the main belay loop.  Some concerns about either placement are:</p>

<p><strong>Leg Loops</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>If you're placing an autoblock on your leg loop AND you're using a ""quick release"" buckle, the carabiner that's holding the autoblock can catch on the buckle and release the tension on that leg loop.  It probably wouldn't make you fall out of your harness, but would be uncomfortable, and you'd hang at an odd angle.</li>
<li>The leg loops of a harness aren't strength-tested independently of the harness as a unit.  Also, if the autoblock did manage to catch the entire weight of the climber, it would place a different stress on the leg loop than a person normally weighting the harness would.  If you had a harness with stitched leg loops, like the Black Diamond Chaos, the weight of the autoblock would be pulling the stitches apart (this is not the direction of force you have when you weight a harness normally).</li>
<li>I no longer put my autoblock on my leg loop for the reasons I mention above.  I originally did, when I had a different harness, but my 2 current harnesses are the new Misty Mountain Cadallac, and the Black Diamond Chaos, one has quick release buckes, and the other has stiched leg loops.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Belay Loop</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>If you're placing an autoblock on your belay loop, you have to make sure and extend your belay device when rappeling (using a sling or something like the Metolius PAS).  This issue is that if the loops of the autoblock are too close to the belay device, they can get caught in it, and jam the rappel system (probably making you unable to decend the rope, but possibly forcing the rope to ""fail open"").  If you got stuck in this fashion, it would be pretty difficult to free yourself, esp. if you were in a free-hanging rappel.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sorry for not giving a single recommendation, as in many situations in climbing, there are multiple options, and its important to know what the tradeoffs are.</p>

<p><strong>Carabiner</strong></p>

<p>As per usual, you want to make sure your carabiner is loaded along its spine.  That is, longways.  So, one end of the carabiner will be running through the leg loop or belay loop, and the other end will have both strands of the autoblock coord.</p>

<p><strong>What I do</strong></p>

<p>I place my autoblock on my main belay loop, then extend my belay device with a PAS.  The rope runs down between my legs, and I can use either hand to control my descent.  My autoblock is made out of coord that I measured and cut specifically to be too short to catch up in my extended belay device.</p>

"What is the impact of clothing color in a tropical jungle environment?","3904","","<p>I heard that light colors attract less insects than dark, that dark colors could be warmer, and I was advised against wearing white in the jungle. Where can I get a comprehensive list of the effects different colors will have in a tropical jungle environment? Do these effects differ in different environments?</p>
","<p>According to one study of one species of mosquito, ""attractiveness was found to vary inversely with their reflectivity or brightness, although the different textures represented in the series tended to obscure the generalised relationship"" (Brown 1954).</p>

<p>Meaning the brighter the clothing, the less attractive for one species of mosquito found in Canada... I can't find any more recent studies, or any that extend this to tropical mosquitoes / bugs.</p>

<p>I can offer, however, personal experience from two years working in the tropical rain forest of Borneo: they are gonna get you.</p>

<p>Whether there is a significant reduction in mosquitoes, black flies, or leeches that stems from wearing different colors, I have not noticed... and since it only takes one malaria (other disease) infested mosquito biting you to infect you, your best bet is to use a <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/392/what-type-of-mosquito-repellent-is-most-effective"">DEET based repellent.</a></p>

<p>As far as <em>other impacts</em> go, bright colors make you more visible to animals and birds, thus reduce your chances of seeing them. Dark colors, camouflage and the like can help increase your odds of seeing the illusive rain forest residents. That reason alone informs my wardrobe choice.</p>

<p>And although conventional wisdom says lighter colors will keep you cooler - this only is a factor where there is sunlight. Dark colors absorb more light/heat than light colors which reflect more. However, in the tropical ""jungle"" sunlight is not much of an issue - and you will be hot/sweaty regardless of what color you wear.</p>

"Probability of Being Struck by Lightning","3898","","<p>I just moved to a new place (Edmonton, Alberta) and I wasn't really prepared for the strange weather here.  My room is really hot right now and I want to sit outside for a bit in the rain where it's cool.  But there's a LOT of lightning and <a href=""http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/outdoors.htm"">http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/outdoors.htm</a> says to always get inside in a lightning storm when possible.</p>

<p>What are my actual probabilities of being struck if I sit outside in a lightning storm.  Should I really worry about it?</p>
","<p>Here's a lot more advice than you aked for: </p>

<p>Around 24000 people in the entire world are struck by lightning each year. Supposing you live to be 85, that's 2 million people in your lifetime. On 7 billion people alive today, that's a lifetime chance of 1 in 3500 -- your chances are pretty slim anyway :)</p>

<p>But, to be more elaborate: your chances of being struck depend entirely on your surroundings. As you indicated, you're going to be near your house, which is of course much higher than your body height, and thus closer to any lightning cloud, and thus a much more likely target for lightning to strike. Provided you have a lightning rod (or similar) installed, the rod is the most direct way for a bolt to go into the ground, and will therefore considerably decrease your chances of being struck (NOT reduce it to zero though -- lightning is pretty predictable, until it's not). </p>

<p>There are a few caveats here -- if you do not have a lightning rod, your house is all wet from the rain, and you're touching a doorknob or standing near a pillar or something, a bolt <em>may</em> choose to use your body as a ""least resistance"" path to the ground (although water lines or power lines inside your wall still form a much more likely candidate). When a storm is directly overhead, alway open doors, windows, etc. with your right hand, while standing on your right leg -- this reduces the chances of the current moving through your heart in the (unlikely) event you are struck this way. </p>

<p>Also, if the bolt is conducted into the ground by a rod (or a tree or power line or similar), and you're standing near the point of entry, there may be secondary effects that can harm you (indirect impact). These are on average much less severe than a direct hit, but are known to have been lethal in some cases.</p>

<p>If you're NOT going to be near your house, make sure you're going to stand near tall things (<strong>NEAR</strong>, not under). Be sure to stay well out of the region where the tall thing might reach you should it be struck, break and fall. </p>

<p>Suppose worst comes to worst: you find yourself in the middle of a severe thunderstorm in an open field. In that case -- if you can find a (few) long stick(s), or have one of those tents supported by fiberglass sticks with you, stick them in the ground, straight up, in a large circular pattern, <em>before</em> the storm is directly overhead. If there is no time, just skip it! Then (in the center of the circle) make yourself as small as you possibly can, while also making as little contact with the ground as possible. That is, crouch down, keep your head low between your knees, standing on the balls of your feet, keep your feet close together, and start praying. Stay that way until the worst of the storm has passed. Don't even look up until you are sure that the average time between lightning and thunder is at least a second. </p>

<p>But the very best thing you can do is of course avoid these situations all together. Inside your house, or a cafeteria, motel, pub, any place <em>inside</em> you can find, is the safest place to be. Inside a car is also perfectly safe due to it being an effective Farraday cage. Really anything you can find, a bus stop, stable, a cave (if you're in the mountains, God forbid), hunter's cabin, anything. </p>

<p>This is what I always got as advice from guides I met on hiking trips. I always stuck to it, but actually, I never verified any of it :) (aside from the odd documentary on TV).</p>

<p>Different question, but but it contains a lot of the same releveant information for an answer to this one also; basically <strong>either one will work well</strong>.</p>

<p>Short summary: Your rope is designed to absorb the impact of your fall, while a sling is absolutely not. In the videos presented by DMM you can see what happens when the sling is forced to absorb the impact of a fall, and it's not pretty. There might be some marginal decrease to impact force on your protection (namely spikes in this case) by using Nylon slings, but it's rarely going to be a measurable difference.</p>

<p>A good and attentive belay, and a soft catch is your best defense from high impact forces, and any UIAA approved sling can be expected to hold the force of a falling climber <em>when being belayed by a rope</em>.</p>

"Tips for hunting nocturnal deer","3868","","<p>I recently moved to a property on 20 acres and I'm a total noob when it comes to hunting. There are several deer stands setup all over the property mostly along the tree line overlooking some open fields. I've done some scouting and have found tracks, rubs, and trails all over the place including in the open fields. I've set out corn and have found fresh tracks around it and have seen it eaten. I've sat in a few of the stands at all different hours and have not been able to actually see any deer. Finally I went out and bought a camera and have set it up around some of the corn plots that I've put out. The only time I've gotten any pictures of deer has been either 2 hours after dark or sometime in the middle of the night and they were some pretty large does. I have yet to get anything in the middle of the day. </p>

<p>What should I be doing to try and draw them out or find them during actual hunting hours? I'm certain that part of the reason they're only coming at night is because now that we're living there they are aware of us and stay away. Any and all suggestions would be much appreciated.</p>
","<ul>
<li>Follow their patterns.  You need to know where they sleep, eat, and drink.  20 acres is small, are they only on your property for food?  water?  Can they get these anywhere else?  Find the trail and be patient.  </li>
<li>You will almost never see deer in the middle of the day.  Dawn and dusk are your friends.</li>
<li>If they are sleeping on your property stalk hunt them.  You startle them awake, they run and, bingo.</li>
<li>If they travel, try to create a funnel.  Create a place they have to go through to get from point A to point B.  Once you have them moving the way you want, you will have better luck of catching a straggler.</li>
<li>Hunt days where it sucked the night before.  Very cold and/or very rainy nights followed by clear mornings will generally do better.  Deer will want to hunker down in the bad weather and wait when they can.</li>
<li>They move at night less during a new moon, you'll have better dawn/dusk luck during this time.</li>
<li>Make <em>sure</em> your approach paths do not screw with travel, even when scouting.  You scout like you hunt.  Don't scare them off with your noise and scent when going to and from your cameras.  </li>
<li>20 acres isn't much to be hunting on.  You definitely need to manage your land and your use of it.  Pet and human movement will affect the deer.  You may have to decide which you want more, as using the land for hunting may require giving up other enjoyments of the land.</li>
<li>Learn what your neighbors do. Is there heavy predator pressure around you?</li>
<li>It definitely depends on where you are, so perhaps add to your question what specific area you live in (at least down to a regional level).</li>
</ul>

<p>Not directly your question, but things I'd like to add for anyone reading.</p>

<ul>
<li>Trail cameras have legal restrictions in many states.</li>
<li>Baiting (ie, food plots) is illegal in many states.</li>
<li>Most states have laws about hunting similar to drug laws, putting you at risk of asset forfeiture -- in this case it could result in you losing your entire house and land.  Enforcement officials do not have to get a conviction to seize your land and it can take years to regain it even if you are not convincted.  Make sure you know the regulations <em>before</em> you put out cameras and food plots.</li>

"How bad do circumstances need to be before activating a PLB?","3866","","<p>Personal Locator Beacons (PLBs) can be carried during outdoor activities to use in case of an emergency. But are there any guidelines on what exactly constitutes an ""emergency""? For example, what about the following situations:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You slip and fall on a trail several hours away from the trailhead, breaking several bones and putting you in intense pain. Should you hobble back to the trailhead to call for help or activate the PLB?</p></li>
<li><p>You are bitten by a rattlesnake, experience symptoms of envenomation, and are several hours away from your car. Do you attempt to hike back and call for help or activate the PLB?</p></li>
<li><p>While skiing in the morning in an isolated area of a ski resort, you run into a tree and break bones. No one responds to calls for help. Do you activate the PLB or wait until nightfall to see if anyone finds you?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Those are kind of contrived examples, but basically when is it appropriate to use a PLB? If the answers are different for different countries, I'm wondering specifically about use in the US.</p>
","<p>There are three criteria to be balanced in my thinking on the situation of when and if to activate a call for help to a rescue service:</p>

<ol>
<li>Do you have the skills and training to extract yourself safely from the current situation? Equally important is your assessment of what other means of communications are likely to be available in the timeframe your current emergency demands.</li>
<li>Will activating the beacon now give rescuers more time to assess the situation or do you have time to delay and avoid occupying scarce and potentially costly responder assets.</li>
<li>How long will it take for your other safety nets to trigger? How many people know where you are and when you are expected back? Will they call the authorities or just assume you are back and forgot to check in with them?</li>
</ol>

<p>I am not advocating delaying a call for help when life is in danger, but instead to only hesitate when you are comfortable that you can handle the situation or that help is near so you can postpone calling on resources when you don't really need them. Similarly, if you are going to need help, everyone is better off if that request gets made <strong>now</strong> rather than later.</p>

"Why are there separate seasons for archery and firearm hunting for deer?","3860","","<p>I was reading up on Pennsylvania's hunting regulations and noticed there are different seasons for the hunting of deer with bow-and-arrow and firearms. Why is this?</p>

<p>I can understand hunting seasons in general, because you don't want to disrupt the mating and birthing cycles, but why does the method affect this? One kill is one kill...</p>
","<p>I think the main reason for this is that the hunting styles are a lot different between the two. Archery hunters often don't wear orange and get very close to the their prey while gun hunters wear orange and are able to hunt at ranges of hundreds of yards.</p>

<p>Combining those activities at the same time increase the risk of archery hunters being shot by gun hunters.</p>

<p>It evens the playing field between the people who are currently hunting and keeps the archery hunters from getting irritated by all of the noise the gun hunters are making.</p>

<p>Often archery seasons are much longer because the chances of success are much lower.</p>

<p>My sleeping bag is rated to -8C ""comfort"", so I assume that will be sufficient.  I also have one of those small self-inflating mats for ground insulation.  I have a small three-season tent.</p>

<p>It's only a short weekend trip.  Friday night will be camping by the car (elevation 350m), and obviously I can take all manner of warm things.  Saturday morning, drive to start and then <a href=""http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/things-to-do/Walking-tracks/Corker-trail"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">walk</a> to <a href=""http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/camping-and-accommodation/campgrounds/Wombat-Creek-campground"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wombat Creek</a> (elevation 1400m) and set up camp.

","<p>So at 5C, with 60Kmh winds, that gives you a <strong>feeling</strong> of about <strong>-2C</strong> <a href=""http://atlantic.ctvnews.ca/ctv-news-at-5/weather-blog/i-had-to-dig-out-my-mittens-and-the-wind-chill-chart-1.1526944"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">See here</a>. Not zero, If the air temperature gets to 0C then there's a potential for about <strong>-9C</strong>.</p>

<p>You want to be aiming for a laying system so you can adjust your core temperature with movement, if you stop you'll want something to keep you warm. </p>

<p>I'm not sure you have anything like that in that list. I'd say what you have is fine for when your moving but if you need to stop for any period of time your going to get cold fast. </p>

<p>I'd add at least another thick fleece if not a down jacket if you can get one.</p>

<p>Also be wary that if the worst should happen and you get injured, in those temperatures <strong>hypothermia</strong> is a real concern. I'd also pack some kind of survival bag (or bothy bag) to give you shelter from the wind. </p>

<p>I'm a bit concerned by your <code>full length cargo pants (these are cotton)</code> also, see <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/7571/does-cotton-really-kill""><strong>Does cotton really kill?</strong></a>. Cotton is a bad material for these kinds of situations, typically. You'd be better off with some kind of man made fibre.</p>

<h2>TL;DR</h2>

<p>Seems a bit light to me, you may be fine but if your the temperature drops more or you need to rest/stop then you likely going to get cold fast. If you have too many layers then you carry a little too much weight, if you don't have enough then you could get into some dangerous ground. If in doubt be cautious.</p>

"How should I choose between setting up a Cordelette or an Equalette climbing anchor?","3819","","<p>I was going through anchoring techniques and I came across this well-received question:<br>
<a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/4835/anchor-without-cordelette"">Anchor without cordelette?</a> </p>

<p>How should one decide when to go for a Cordelette or an Equalette?</p>
","<p>I've had to deal with this question a lot teaching anchor building. When people have asked in the past I normally suggest they <em>use the anchor you are most comfortable setting up, as they will both definitely work.</em></p>

<p>That said, if we want to dive deeper into the rabbit hole, it's important to identify some distinct differences between them.</p>

<p><strong>Equalette</strong>: Typical top-rope setup on bolts or gear using a sewn-sling or cord. Characterized by carabiners on separate strands, most often with limiting knots to each side. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i255.photobucket.com/albums/hh131/daveebel92/IMG_0265.jpg"" alt=""Equalette Anchor""></p>

<p>Advantages over Cordelette:</p>

<ul>
<li>Anchor is self-equalizing (meaning if you pull the load 20 degrees to the left, it's still going to distribute the weight between the two points).</li>
<li>Faster if pre-setup and tossed around your shoulder (when you get to the bolts at the end of a climb, attach one slide to each bolt and you're done).</li>
<li>Stronger than cordelette if tied using a sewn-sling.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><strong>Cordelette</strong>: Mostly now seen where an Equalette isn't. Characterized by a huge knot joining all connection points together.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ETnH9.jpg"" alt=""Cordelette Anchor""></p>

<p>Advantages over Equalette:</p>

<ul>
<li>Just as easy to setup with 3, 4 or even 5 pieces of gear as it is with 2 (making it more versatile for trad anchors or suspect ice anchors).</li>
<li>Cheaper than sewn-slings if you need to leave it behind.</li>
<li>Faster to set up from scratch, and much much faster to re-rack when you're ready to take it down (often only one knot needs to be removed, and it's usually much bulkier and easier to untie).</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>While discussions about anchors, (especially theoretical holding power), may rage on for generations to come, you can probably make some good rules of thumb by thinking about the most significant differences.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For single-pitch climbing: use an Equalette setup whenever the route traverses
  significantly, and use a Cordellete when the route follows a direct line up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Additional reading:</strong> Lots of anchors variations exist - the <em>Triplet</em>, <em>ACR</em>, and <em>Sliding X</em> to name a few. They are all useful to know also. In a multi-pitch context, having a master point involving two carabiners is a major pain so the Equalette would be off the table for me. The more anchors you can tie, the more you can plug in what makes the most sense.</p>

"What are the options for kayak self-rescue without a paddle float?","3803","","<p>In a standard kayaking class, you're taught solo self-rescues using a paddle float and assisted rescues using another kayak. Then there are eskimo rolls. But I've also heard about other self-rescue techniques after a wet exit without a paddle float (ladder, cowboy, scramble). What options are there for kayak self-rescues without a paddle float or a friend, and in what conditions would each be used?</p>
","<p>Being without a sold ""roll"", partner, or paddle float can make it quite challenging for a novice to re-enter their kayak after a capsize. However there are techniques which will make it easier to get back in your boat safely.
<hr>
<strong>Note</strong>: All of these should first be practiced in mildly shallow water, in flat water. Don't practice in rough water until you can achieve these in flat water. <strong>However</strong> no self rescue can be called <strong>confident</strong> until you can reliably perform it in conditions <strong>rougher</strong> than you like to paddle in. You are most likely to capsize in <strong>rough</strong> conditions, not flat water, so work up to the challenging stuff. <strong>With a partner or group.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Second note</strong>: No amount of reading or self study is substitute for a good teacher, and practical experience. Don't think that because you read this article that you now are competent in self rescue. You can only get that from practice. Join a paddle club, and get <strong>face to face assistance</strong>.</p>

<p>Now that's out of the way...</p>

<h1>From easiest to most challenging...</h1>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: All except the wet entrance and roll should be attempted with a partially empty boat. Do this by tipping the boat from the bow with your body weight and using a quick flip.</p>

<h2>Ladder Crawl</h2>

<p>Beginning from the back of the boat:</p>

<ol>
<li>Stow your paddle in the deck rigging, to get it out of your way, and prevent losing it.</li>
<li>Orient so that bow is perpendicular to the prevailing direction of the waves.</li>
<li>Holding the stern, use your body weight to bring the stern under the surface. </li>
<li>Wait for a swell to raise the boat bow further, then make a quick kick with your feet, and launch your torso on top of the stern decking.</li>
<li>Keep your body low, and your legs wide in the water.</li>
<li>Slowly work forward to the cockpit, staying low.</li>
<li>Drop your butt into the cockpit</li>
<li>Kick your legs over the cockpit combing and into the boat.</li>
<li>Pump out remaining water, and reapply the spray skirt.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Rodeo</h2>

<ol>
<li>Same as above, store your paddle in the deck rigging, try to make it perpendicular to the boat.</li>
<li>Orient the boat so that the bow and stern are in line with the direction of prevailing waves.</li>
<li>Approach the stern of the boat <strong>perpendicularly</strong> and grab onto the <em>safety lines</em>, <strong>not bungees</strong> along the sides of the boat.</li>
<li>Wait for a wave to raise the bow, then launch your torso onto the stern deck.</li>
<li>Kick one leg over the stern and orient with your head towards the bow.</li>
<li>Follow steps 4-8 above in ""The Ladder""</li>
</ol>

<h2>Side-entry without float</h2>

<ol>
<li>Insert paddle into rigging, behind cockpit, and twist to lock into place. 

<ul>
<li>Orient with paddle blade face, ""<em>Feathered</em>"" against the water. (Increases resistance after weighting, lowering roll chances)
2.Place leg on top of paddle, grab cock pit combing, and kick opposite leg up and into the cock pit.</li>
<li>You will end up face down, looking toward the stern of the boat.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bring other leg into cock pit (<strong>quickly</strong>), and twist body to orient towards the bow (<strong>slowly</strong>).</li>
<li>Remove paddle from rigging. </li>
<li>Pump out remaining water and re-apply spray skirt. </li>
</ol>

<h2>Re-entry and Roll</h2>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: This is a move usually only achievable by someone with a semi-consistent roll. Also, do not worry about the water in the cockpit unless it is <strong>completely</strong> full. Water can actually help, because the boat will sit lower in the water.</p>

<ol>
<li>Leave the boat turned upside down. (<strong>Do not</strong> flip right side up!)</li>
<li>Orient the boat so that the bow and stern are perpendicular to the direction of travel of the waves. 

<ul>
<li>Waves should be washing over the side of the boat. (Usually a bad thing)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Align yourself along the side of the boat, and grab the cockpit combing with your inside hand.</li>
<li>Slide your legs into the cockpit partially. </li>
<li>Take a breath and slide your legs all the way into the cock pit while submerging your body under the water.</li>
<li>Take your paddle, align it parallel to the boat so that your lead hand (strong) is forward.</li>
<li>In a fast but consistent motion make a 180 degree arc. 

<ul>
<li>Use the weak hand as a fulcrum.</li>
<li>Let the strong hand break the surface of the water. </li>
<li>At 90 degrees drive lead hand underwater by arcing your back and plunging your body <strong>deeper</strong> under water. </li>
<li><strong>Complete the motion</strong>, and finish with your back near the stern of the boat.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Your boat (with any practice and luck) will be on top of the water right side up. </li>
<li>Empty the boat of water, and re-apply the spray skirt.
<br></li>
</ol>

The only data I have been able to find so far on moose mortality from MVCs dates from 1980 (from <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.424.8675&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The toll of the automobile:

<h3>Sustainability of the Moose Population</h3>

This source summarizes the management of the moose population in in Sweden and is part of a larger project funded by the European Union’s 7th Framework Research Programme.  Hunting appears to be conscientiously regulated in Sweden with due regard for the management of game populations.  However, I am not knowledgeable enough to critique this report.  Of the ungulate populations in Europe (not just Sweden) the report says:</p>

  <p>Some countries, where the total ungulate population has increased to its highest level since the Ice Age have raised a general concern for negative ecosystem impacts due to overgrazing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The support for hunting among the public in Sweden is strong. There is
  thus a wide acceptance for hunting, in terms of wildlife management

  recreational hunting is however lower.</p>

"What's meant by poundage or weight of a bow?","3779","","<p>I see a lot of posts in <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/archery"">archery</a> which contains topics about the ""draw weight"" or ""poundage"". I assume that it doesn't have to do anything with the actual weight of the bow. </p>

<p>So, what does it mean (in depth)?</p>

<p>This is especially interesting if you consider that there are <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/9998/is-there-a-minimum-poundage-required-for-bow-hunting"">minimum limits for hunting</a>. </p>
","<h2>Short answer</h2>

<p>The draw weight of a bow is the pull weight which applies to your fingers on the string while the bow is fully stretched. This weight changes with the length you stretch the bow. So, to compare different bows, the bowyers often refer to 28 inches. This indication often looks like this <code>50#@28""</code>. This basically means that you have to hold 55 pounds (#) if you pull the string 28 inches ("") back. </p>

<h2>TL;DR answer</h2>

<p>I've already talked about the draw weight a little bit in <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/9984/should-i-use-a-double-or-triple-broadhead-for-boars"">this question</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Draw weight:</p>
  
  <p>The force required to hold the string stationary at full draw is often
  used to express the power of a bow, and is known as its draw weight,
  or weight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's easy as that, really. It's just the force one needs to apply to pull the bow.</p>

<p>However, you have to hold in mind that this indication doesn't really say something about the bow. It's like someone is saying: ""My (not further defined) vehicle has 120 HP."" What do you know? Nothing, to be honest. You'll ask the person about the kind of his car and motor. You may also want to know the weight of it and so on. </p>

<p>The same thing applies to bows. First of all the poundage is mostly given for 28"" draw length*. This is just a standardization cause every archer has its own draw length depending on his anchor and body size. Refer to it as the 3000 rounds per minute which are used to measure the horse power of a car. </p>

<p>So, let's say an archer is shooting a 35#@28"" bow but has a draw length of 26"". He is effectively shooting about a little bit over 30 pounds. Just like a 100 HP car driven at 2000 rpm has only about 80 HP or something. </p>

<p>The other thing to hold in mind is that it doesn't have to do anything with the speed of the bow (how fast the arrows fly). This depends on your bowtype (e.g. recurve-bow, longbow, compound-bow), your bow material, your string, your arrows and so on. Just like you don't know anything about the vehicle in the first place. Things just get clearer the more details you get (it's a sports-car, it weights x kg ...). </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Draw length:</p>
  
  <p>The maximum distance the string could be displaced and thus the
  longest arrow that could be loosed from it, a bow’s draw length, is
  determined by the size of the archer.</p>

"Theft and tent camping","3748","","<p>I used to go tent-trailer camping as a kid ('60s and '70s, west coast US and Canada) and don't recall worrying about people going into our campground and stealing things. Now I'm thinking about getting back into camping (tent, not tent-trailer, and now in New England), and am worried that, if we pitch a tent, then go off to the beach or something, someone will steal our stuff.</p>

<p>Is that a reasonable concern? If so, is there something I can do to keep from getting ripped off?</p>
","<p>In most places I think the risk of theft while camping is generally low. People who choose to do camping for their holiday often don't give the impression of having lots of expensive gear. Even if some camping gear is quite expensive you either need specialist knowledge to know its value and/or its resale value is quite low. Added to the relatively low payoff there are often people around campsites even during the day (although this varies a lot by location) which would increase the risk of thieves getting caught. Therefore, campsites rarely attract dedicated thieves.</p>

<p>However, you are still leaving all you possessions in your tent easily accessible/unlocked so some precautions are advisable. Mainly, I would try and lock any valuables, particularly electronics, in your car or similar. At least hide then somewhere not obvious. </p>

<p>While things such as sleeping bags can have significant value I think the chance of anyone stealing them is very low. Personally, I would be more concerned about people breaking into my house while I was away.</p>

"What is the difference between single and double wall tents?","3746","","<p>Tents are described being either single or double wall.</p>

<p>What is the difference and when is one preferred over the other?</p>
","<p>The difference between a single wall tent and a double wall tent is the rain fly (or lack thereof). A single wall tent has only one layer of fabric, this layer provides protection from the elements, and is the only walls of the tent. A double wall tent usually has a mesh inner tent with a fly that sits on top to protect you from the elements. </p>

<p>The benefits to the single wall tent are it's lightness (because there are fewer parts) and it's price (again fewer parts means cheaper tent). The downsides of a single wall tent are that ventilation can be poor causing condensation to build up in the tent. That brings us to the double wall tent, it's primary benefit is keeping condensation from building up. (Newer double wall tents have mitigated the heaviness of the additional fabrics by using newer materials that are pretty light.) </p>

","<p>Most survival experts recommend parachute cord. From <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute_cord"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Parachute cord (also paracord or 550 cord) is a lightweight nylon kernmantle rope originally used in the suspension lines of US parachutes during World War II. Once in the field, paratroopers found this cord useful for many other tasks. It is now used as a general purpose utility cord by both military personnel and civilians. This versatile cord was even used by astronauts during STS-82, the second Space Shuttle mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>

"How to keep contact lenses from freezing during backpacking in cold temps?","3672","","<p>My fiance and I are planning our first backpacking trip together. I am an experienced backpacker, so I can handle most questions he has and I already have most of the gear that we'll need. However, he wears contacts and is worried about losing contacts and keeping his contacts from freezing. He is very near sighted and has astigmatism. I have never worn contacts or glasses so I'm not sure how to deal with this. </p>

<p>Issues: </p>

<p>+Our backpacking trip must occur in spring or fall due to his job, and will probably occur in places where snow and cold temps are possible if not likely. I read that contact solution freezes at 28 °F (-2°C).  I have been out spring backpacking in single-digit temps °F (-18–-12°C).</p>

<p>+His glasses no longer fit his prescription. </p>

<p>+We're a little broke, so buying new glasses ($400! per pair!) or a different type of contact lens is not really doable for us. </p>

<p>+Leaving contacts in overnight is something he will not do. </p>

<p>To handle the losing contacts issue, I am planning on having him bring at least 2 spare pairs of contact lenses (and if he loses 2 contacts, we'll bail). To handle cleanliness issues, I have ordered hand wipes and we'll bring at least two travel bottles of contact solution. So my question is how to keep contacts in the contact case from freezing in cold temps? (Also, any contact-wearing backpackers have any additional tips for backpacking with contacts?)</p>
","<p>HTH all of y'all .. I've learned it all the hard way. </p>

<p>To address a few of the points:</p>

<ol>
<li>Your fiance is ABSOLUTELY correct to not wear them overnight, can get eye pits, etc.  not fun.  painful, no vision.  been there done that, refuse to do again.</li>
<li>For the prescription it sounds like I'm in about the same boat. even with insurance i paid $300 for new glasses recently.  TAKE THE GLASSES as a fail safe.  the contacts are more do-able, with some preparation.</li>
<li>The nalgene purified water will work .. to a point.  it isn't the same salinity as what is in your eyes, so it feels off, and will be irritating to his eyes.  not so great for enjoying the natural beauty of rugged land.</li>
<li>Yes contacts can be had for relatively inexpensive compared to glasses, but still require a recent prescription.  And once you're in severe astigmatism territory, it doesn't save THAT much.  Not everyone has YOUR prescription, some folks are worse off (and some are better), but I guarantee the farther the prescription is from 20/20 .. the MORE it costs.  Having the same trait is not equal to having it in the same severity.  </li>
</ol>

<p>Get some hand heaters, like for gloves, or shoes .. they should last 4-6 hours .. grab the 8hr if you can find them .. and they only cost a few dollars. Those will keep the solution warm enough to not freeze for the time period those temps would occur. They can also be used to melt out ice should it form pretty quickly (they get TOASTY hot).</p>

<p>If you can't find those, as listed above, put the storage case in your sleeping bag. To warm it up QUICK, best to use the heaters above, or use armpits. warmest place on the body outside of the groin. Regardless, when storing: INSULATE.  find some thermal wrap (like the tinfoil lined stuff) or layer tinfoil and paper with felt or cloth (and repeat a few times) as an insulator, and wrap it all around the saline bottle, with the hand heater in between.  The more wraps, the better insulation, the longer it lasts in colder temps.  That takes care of the cleaning component.  The bigger thing is the storage case that they sit in overnight.  Would not want to try and chip them out of ice blocks in the case in the AM.. but if that happens wear glasses for a few hours until it warms up.  same thing though, since that is usually smaller than the saline bottle (and if you're going for up to a week one of the small bottles (4-6 oz) is FINE.  don't haul more than you need.  You'rr talking about 5-10 drops to rinse when removing from storage and putting in the eyes.  so call it 30 drops a day, allowing for some spillage.  Once in the eyes, natural body temp will keep them from freezing.  No worries there. I've skiid/hiked in sub zero with contacts in and they are WAAY better than glasses.</p>

","<p>You have several options for keeping your toes warm, but ultimately, toes are going to get cold on really cold days... it is just part of the fun.</p>

<p>Try the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unbuckle your boots while riding up a lift (or stoppping to rest in the back-country) -- this allows circulation to more freely access your toes.</li>
<li>Wiggle your toes within your boots to keep the blood flowing</li>
<li>Err on thinner socks to keep the amount of insulating area in your boots at its maximum. Cramming more fabric into your boot is counter-intuitively a bad idea.</li>
<li>Try <a href=""http://www.rei.com/product/679011/bootglove"">boot coozies</a>. (I was just gifted a pair, but haven't tried them. I'll post here if if/when my pride can allow me test them...)</li>
<li>Pocket hand/toe warmers contain different chemicals/powders that can create heat when activated. Try placing these <em>inside and the back of your thigh along your arteries</em> to warm the blood heading to your toes.</li>

"Is it realistic to teach yourself rock climbing?","3659","","<p>I've been wanting to get into rock climbing for a while but I live in a very flat area with no climbing gyms around. I'm planning on moving to the Pacific Northwest soon and I wanted to know what the general consensus was about teaching yourself to climb. Obviously it would be easier to have a guide, but I'm also trying to save money wherever I can. </p>

<p>I've seen a lot of people recommend this book: <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1594851387"">Freedom of the Hills</a> as a good way for getting into it and learning everything you can. I've been researching as much as I can online.</p>

<p>Is it a realistic goal to teach yourself how to climb or is it really necessary (and safe) to be taught by a professional? Does anyone have experiences or stories of this?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>EDIT: I should mention that I won't be all by myself, I have a partner to climb with, just another novice, my fiancee. I guess I meant more like professional instruction vs. self-taught. </p>
","<p>With dedication you could learn to climb at a top-rope or bouldering climbing gym without professional instruction.  The key skill there is belaying, and you could learn that from videos.  However I would never recommend this route if <em>good</em> instruction is available.  You may have difficulty separating Internet know-it-alls from experts, therefore you may not know if you are following wisdom or nonsense unless you get professional instruction.  While learning from an experienced climber <em>may</em> help, there are also a lot of experienced climbers with bad safety skills, so having survived X years of climbing is really no proof of good fundamentals.  At the very least gyms usually offer a one-session intro class that teaches how to belay, put on your harness, tie in, etc.</p>

<p>If you wish to do real (outdoor) climbing you <em>will</em> want both instruction and someone experienced to climb with; there are simply too many things you don't know you don't know in my opinion.  The books I've read don't cover everything, and some things just can't be learned from that medium anyway.  Rather than ""hiring a guide"" I recommend that you find a rock climbing course.  Vet the instructor.  I took one at a local community college and I was fortunate enough to get a very good instructor, but I know that some people who took a course at the same place a few years before I did learned techniques that my instructor would have failed, saying they were deprecated by the <a href=""http://amga.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">AMGA</a> over 20 years ago.</p>

<p>Books lay things out in an organized and systematic form that you can easily reference.  <em>How to Rock Climb!</em> by John Long was required reading for the first climbing course I took, and I haven't seen a better book of the same type.</p>

<hr>

<p>Blackbear asked:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'm wondering what your opinion would be on what gear to buy first and what gear to possibly rent? I'm a bit hesitant to go out and buy all new gear if it turns out that we're not good at it, or don't end up liking it. As far as I can tell, buying a <strong>harness, shoes, belay device, chalk bag and some locking carabiners</strong> would be a good first step. Is climbing rope generally supplied in climbing gyms? </p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Shoes</h3>

<p>If you have an interest in climbing and no nagging injuries that would make it painful or difficult I simply can't imagine you not enjoying <em>some</em> style of climbing.  It takes a while to figure out what climbing shoes should feel like, but honestly I would just buy the first pair from REI so that you can return them if they don't work out or you realize they are the wrong size.  I chose to use rental shoes and I got a nasty case of nail fungus for the first time in my life; it ended up costing me a lot more than new shoes would have.</p>

<p>Fit to the shape of your foot is most important.  It doesn't matter how ""good"" a shoe is if it doesn't fit you right, and feet vary a great deal, so don't look at what other people are wearing as a guide.  You want a shoe that feels like it was vacuum molded to your foot: zero gaps anywhere, but not compressive.  In other words ""fits like a glove"" or as close as you can get.  Some shoes stretch very little, some stretch quite a bit, so you won't really know how a shoe will fit until you've worn it for a while.  I highly recommend buying from a place that lets you return them even after they are worn, rather than guessing they will stretch and fitting them too tightly.  Good climbing is usually about using your feet well rather than hauling yourself up with your arms, and you won't use your feet well if they hurt; avoid that.</p>

<h3>Top-rope or Bouldering</h3>

<p>You'll want to decide whether to start with bouldering or top-rope climbing.  I recommend top-rope, but I'm a scaredy-cat and like the safety of a top-rope.  Ideally I think you should start out on top-rope to safely learn fundamentals and good footwork, and to give your tendons and ligaments time to strengthen.  Muscle grows faster than connective tissue; injuries are common for those who push too hard right from the start.  Avoid hang boards and other training devices in your first year of climbing; you'll build both strength <em>and</em> skill by actually climbing, and do it more safely.  (Excessive focus on strength may cover bad technique; this is probably why girls often seem to learn faster than guys.)  After perhaps six months of top-rope climbing switch to indoor bouldering for a while to build power and additional skills.  After that you should have a sense of the kind of climbing you want to do and a decent foundation for whatever direction you choose.</p>

<p>If you have an athletic foundation and don't mind a little risk you may prefer (indoor) bouldering. (You could e.g. dislocate an elbow or break a wrist if you fall wrong, even with pads.)  There you'll only need shoes; you can improvise a ""chalk pot"" or the gym may provide one.</p>

<p>If you choose top-rope look for harness packages that include a belay device and belay carabiner (also known as an HMS carabiner) and sometimes a chalk bag; you'll usually save a bit of money this way.  (As you will by getting last year's model on closeout.)  The Black Diamond Momentum package is a popular choice.  Don't spend a fortune on a harness; the very light and expensive ones are for competition climbers and won't make a lick of difference to you, other than possibly being <em>less</em> comfortable.  (An exception is if you are doing mountaineering and want a low-profile harness to fit under a hip belt, as my instructor explained, but I have no experience with that yet.)  Learn to belay with an ATC or other ""tube-style"" device (my preference is the Black Diamond ATC-XP); a ""Gri-Gri"" or other such device will only lead to bad habits at this point and cost far more.</p>

<p>I have never heard of a gym where you bring your own rope for <strong>top-rope climbing</strong>, so yes, they are provided.  (You'll need a UIAA certified Dynamic rope for lead climbing but you aren't ready for that yet.)  A number of gyms even have auto-belay devices now which let you climb without a partner; it is an auto-braking system that lowers you slowly when you fall off.  If you climb on an auto-belay make sure you do an <em>extra</em> safety check since you won't have a partner to catch mistakes like putting your harness on wrong!</p>

<h3>Safety</h3>

<p>Make sure all your safety equipment (harness, belay device, carabiners, etc.) is properly certified.  Look for a logo like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Aste0.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Be aware that there are counterfeit climbing goods in existence so buy only from reputable sources.</p>

<p>Carefully read all of the instruction booklets and labels that come with your gear; they will warn you against various kinds of misuse that could kill you, such as <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/a/1415/133"">improperly loading a carabiner</a> or using bleach on your harness.  Make sure that you are using all equipment as intended.  (For example there are climbing ropes that are meant to be used <em>only</em> in pairs; the booklet should make this clear even if an incompetent sales person does not.)  If a piece of gear does not come with a booklet contact the manufacturer for this information; every piece of gear I have purchased has come with such a booklet.</p>

"Trekking near Berlin","3647","","<p>Last year I asked about <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/3531/rifugio-mountain-hut-trek-in-austria"">mountain hut treks near Vienna,</a> and the answers I got helped me plan a wonderful trip. This year I'm going to be in Berlin in June, and would be happy to do a (fairly laid back) two-three day trek somewhere near there. One thing I've read about is a 416 km trail that encircles Berlin, <a href=""http://www.wanderbares-deutschland.de/wanderwege/wanderwege-karte.html#19"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the 66 lakes trail</a>. However, I haven't found much information - certainly not in English - and even in German, I'm missing something like <a href=""http://huetten.alpenverein.at/huettenHome/DE/index.php?lang=en"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the Austrian hut finder site</a> which I used last year to find a good area in Austria.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any suggestions for a specific part of the 66 lakes trail, an alternate suggestion, or know of a good resource to help plan something near Berlin? (When I say ""near"" I mean up to a three hour train/bus ride to a good starting point.)</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> An example of a nice resource that I stumbled upon: <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/Berlin-Hikers/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the ""Berlin Hikers"" Meetup Group.</a> Their list of past events is a useful (and English) guide to hikes around Berlin that I can use as a starting point for planning a longer trip. It seems like they've been to many of the places Paul mentions in his answer below.</p>
","<p>I have so far not been hiking close to Berlin. However, I know to areas that might be worth a try:</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreewald"" rel=""noreferrer"">Spreewald</a> and the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecklenburg_Lake_District"" rel=""noreferrer"">Mecklenburger Seenplatte</a>. Also I just learned about the ""Märkische Schweiz"", a small low mountain range. I have never heard of the 66 lakes trail, so I can´t give you information on that.
Note that you can reach the baltic sea in about three hours, maybe that´s something you would like?</p>

<p><strong>General tips</strong></p>

<p>During my research, I was quite surprised how scarce information is in English (I am german). However, at most tourist bureaus people should be able to speak it, so phoning or mailing them is a good idea. You can try that directly in <a href=""http://www.visitberlin.de/en"" rel=""noreferrer"">Berlin</a> or at the suggested places (links follow). If you already know, where you want to hike (the 66 lakes trail e.g.), you can ask them directly for places to sleep.</p>

<p>Berlin itself is a big city with some nice places for short walks, but nothing I would call hiking. Around it lies the state of Brandenburg. It is mostly flat, has few forests and a lot of agriculture. Due to this, cycling and paddling (where possible) are more popular, hence my question if you consider that.</p>

<p>Despite this, there are two major long distance trails passing by: the <a href=""http://www.traildino.com/trace/continents-Europe/countries-Germany/trails-E10"" rel=""noreferrer"">E10</a> and the <a href=""http://www.traildino.com/trace/continents-Europe/countries-Germany/trails-E11"" rel=""noreferrer"">E11</a>. <a href=""http://www.era-ewv-ferp.com/walking-in-europe/e-paths/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Here</a> you can find general information on the E-trails and <a href=""http://www.fernwege.de/d/e10/etappen/skizze/index.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a> on their particular way in Brandenburg (in German, sorry).</p>

<p><strong>Spreewald</strong></p>

<p>Very beautiful lowland forest. Most people go here to kayak along the small streams and channels in the Spree. There are cycling trails as well as dayhikes. The E10 crosses here (Werben till Groß Köris would be the etaps), so there should be a marked long distance trail. If I would be to hike near Berlin, I would give this a try because it is by far the nicest nature in this area. There are a lot of small villages and, during summer, tourists and it is far from wild. There are a lot of places where to sleep, it can be a little expensive though.
<a href=""http://www.spreewald.de/urlaub-im-spreewald/naturerlebnisse/wandern-im-spreewald/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Here</a> is their tourist information - all German, but you should be able to contact them directly. If you are also interested in history/culture, I would definitely give it a shot, since it is one of the few areas in Germany where there has been preserved some kind of folklore.</p>

<p><em>Get here</em>: ~ 1.5 hrs to Lübben or Märkisch Buchholz by train, about 50-80kms.</p>

<p><strong>Mecklenburger Seenplatte</strong></p>

<p>An area with a lot of lakes: Made for paddling and cycling. However, the E10 passes by, so there should be some hiking possible ( <em>I just read that it hasn´t been realized yet between Strasen and Stralsund, which would contain the part through the Seenplatte. This information might be outdated, but please check with the tourist bureau!</em> ). It would be a good idea to get in touch with their local tourist information, since there are some less densely inhabitated areas where its nicer to walk. They also provide some information in, well, lets call it ""semi-english"" on their <a href=""http://www.mecklenburgische-seenplatte.de/seenplatte_erleben/Aktivsein/wandern/Wanderrouten/index.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">homepage</a>.</p>

<p><em>Get here</em>: ~1.5 hrs to Neustrelitz by train</p>

<p><strong>Märkische Schweiz</strong></p>

<p>A nature reserve with a lush forest, some rolling hills and lakes. For information <a href=""http://www.maerkischeschweiz.eu/cms/front_content.php?idcat=31"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a> (again, in German - sorry!). The E11 seems to pass it. You can probably ask also in Berlin about it.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.meetup.com/Berlin-Hikers/events/190824802/"" rel=""noreferrer"">This is a description</a> of the latest <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/Berlin-Hikers/"" rel=""noreferrer"">""Berlin Hikers""</a> day hike in this area.</p>

<p><em>Get here</em>: ~1 hr by train (switching to a bus brings you closer to the forest, but you can walk through fields instead)</p>

<p>Hope you find this information helpful - maybe you could give a small update about your choice and experience afterwards?</p>

<p>EDIT3: Some small improvements for the ""Märkische Schweiz"" area (Eyal)</p>

<p>EDIT2: After @bashophils suggestion I will add the Saxon Switzerland and steal his links.</p>

<p><strong>Saxon Switzerland</strong> </p>

<p>The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxon_Switzerland"" rel=""noreferrer"">Saxon Switzerland</a> is a low mountain range very popular for rock climbing due to the large amount of cliffs. In my personal opinion it is one of the most beautiful places in Germany. A big part of it is a national park. Two options for hiking there would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Following the <a href=""http://www.saechsische-schweiz.de/en/home-malerweg/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Malerweg</a>, a 8-9 day round trip. You can easily pick only a part of it, I specially can recommend etaps 2-5, but I don´t know the last ones. You have to pay attention where to sleep, though.</li>
<li>Getting a room in the area, e.g. in Bad Schandau, and do a couple of dayhikes from there.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both possibilities will surely provide a unique experience. I didn´t mention this area at first, because it is rather far away and doesn´t belong to the Berlin region. Also, it really merits a visit on its own (like the nearby state capital of Dresden). </p>

<p><em>Get here:</em> ~ 3(fast train) hrs /4.5(slow=cheaper train) hrs from Berlin to the start of the Malerweg or to Bad Schandau in the heart of the area.</p>

<p>EDIT1: I just realized I should probably mention that all this is not about ""untouched nature"" but more or less cultivated lands. I would not call this suggestions a place for an <em>outdoor</em> experience, but more for a couple of nice dayhikes since you will have to sleep inside. Nevertheless, it can be beautiful, just don´t expect wilderness.</p>

There are different sizes and a large variation in markings. The behavior appears similar, so the gender isn't obvious. </p>

<p>They all have names, including Long-tail Chip; Short-tail Chip; Chubby Chip; Skinny Chip; Dark-striped Chip; Light-striped Chip; Pointy-head Chip; Speedy Chip; Lazy Chip; Silly Chip; Brave Chip; Shy Chip. They're all Smart Chip, because they're brilliantly adept at getting into bird feeders and tall pots. They can also reach, and eat their way though, plastic bags of food and nuts which are 6 feet up on shelves in the garage.</p>

<p>Without picking them up, is there a way to tell a male from a female? </p>

<hr>

<p>Update as of April, 2017:
Four weeks ago a very pregnant chipmunk popped up out of a hole in the snow. We memorized her markings to the best of our ability. We saw her again a few days later. Since then, we've been feeding her near that hole every day. She dutifully gathers up the seeds and corn and pops back down. Since the babies stay in the nesting burrow for six to eight weeks, she'll probably keep feeding them until then. In the meantime, many other chipmunks are now very active in the yard. There's a wide variety of sizes, shapes and colors, and there are holes everywhere. The only way we know about the female is that we saw her when she was pregnant. </p>

<p>We're interpreting this rudimentary experiment as further proof that, as @ab2 said, we really can't identify the gender just by looking at them.  </p>
","<p><strong>As to the OP's question:</strong></p>

<p>The answer is <em>Most Probably Not.</em>  </p>

<p>From <a href=""http://www.ct.gov/deep/cwp/view.asp?a=2723&amp;q=345000"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.ct.gov/deep/cwp/view.asp?a=2723&amp;q=345000</a>, a State of Connecticut publication on the Eastern Chipmunk:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is no difference in appearance between males and females.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From <a href=""http://www.ehow.com/how_5750910_tell-chipmunk-male-female.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">How to tell if the Chipmunk is male or female</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>•Pick your chipmunk up with your hands and place him on his back, with
  his rear closest to you. Your chipmunk will probably wiggle and
  protest, therefore, it may take a few times to successfully keep the
  rodent on its back.</p>
  
  <p>•Locate the genitals and anus. These features can be found towards the
  end of the chipmunk and will appear as two distinct bumps.</p>
  
  <p>•Look at the genital area, which is located above the anus. In the
  genital area, males will have two bumps that are about one centimeter
  apart from each other. In females, the bumps are touching each other.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a pet site. The site did not mention any characteristics as a clue to the gender; it went straight to this procedure. This is not definitive, but if you could tell just by looking at the whole chipmunk, they would most likely have give you some clues before describing this procedure.</p>

<p>It is possible that by close observation of behavior in the spring, you could tell which was male.  From <a href=""http://animals.mom.me/mating-habits-chipmunks-10739.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Mating Habits of Chipmunks</a> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In April, mature male chipmunks are ready to mate two weeks before
  females and sometimes compete with each other for females</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Addressing Ben Crowell's comment (you may be seeing two species):</strong></p>

<p>From <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_chipmunk"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia, Eastern Chipmunk</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The eastern chipmunk (Tamias (Tamias) striatus) is a chipmunk species
  found in eastern North America. It is the sole living member of the
  chipmunk subgenus Tamias, sometimes recognised as a separate genus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipmunk"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia, Chipmunk</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chipmunks may be classified either as a single genus, Tamias (Greek:
  ταμίας), or as three genera: Tamias, which includes the eastern
  chipmunk; Eutamias, which includes the Siberian chipmunk; and
  Neotamias, which includes the 23 remaining, mostly western, species</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It doesn't flat-out say so, but I interpret this as the Eastern chipmunk lives in eastern NA and the other species live in western NA (23 of them) or Siberia.
It's that word ""mostly"" which means we can't be 100% sure that you don't have more than one species. (But we know Ben has a lot.)   </p>

"Does a bird really abandon the nest? Will similar birds re-use it?","3626","","<p>This <em>may</em> appear a bit opinion-based. </p>

<p>Birds take a while and a lot of effort to build a nest. Is it okay to take that pretty nest as a sample or a show-piece to put in a personal balcony or a garden?
I don't know if they or the same kind of bird re-use it. Basically, I have seen birds abandoning the nest after they are done with it.</p>

<p>For example, there is bird called the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baya_weaver"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Baya weaver</a>, which has a beautiful nest. See the pic below. I have seen plenty of them, haven't studied them at all.</p>

","<p><strong>Is it okay to take that pretty nest as a sample or a show-piece to put in a personal balcony or a garden?</strong> </p>

<p>This can be a simple question of size.  A large nest, like an eagle's nest, is of course too impractical to take away! but, a really small nest is generally built in a season.  Birds are used to that.  The smaller the nest, the more really good places there will be to build it, from the bird's point of view... unless nest-building habitat is really scarce, in which case, leave it! to be used or ruined or re-used as 'nature' would have it.</p>

<p>Also very important:  if it is a protected or endangered species' nest, you shouldn't even go near it, much less take it away with you.  As an example, California Condors tend to be very easily 'spooked' off the nest when brooding eggs or young... which can lead to loss of the chick or viable egg.</p>

<p>And also important:  for some species, if it is not a highly-constructed nest like that of a typical songbird, which nest is woven together or otherwise wholly made-on-site, the nest can be very scarce as resources go.  Cavity nest sites, for instance, are re-used by many species because such cavities are both rather secure locations, and are also scarce or in short supply - or, require extensive labor to chisel and hollow out.<br>
Another point is, some species have only hollow stubs to nest in - and, for some, the supply of (suitably sited) hollow stubs, or stubs of trees that could be hollowed out with some effort (but for weaker species, not too much i.e. partially rotted softened wood) ... is quite scarce, and a drastic limiter to that species' continued abundance.  I think the American Wood Duck is a good example of this.  They could be more abundant if there were more completely undisturbed (they are very shy and nervous as a consequence of being nearly exterminated/extincted by overhunting etc.) suitable stubs of softened wood near suitable bodies of water... but such rotted wood is eliminated by forestry practices etc.</p>

<p>So in sum:  </p>

<p>Leave rare/endangered/shy species' nests alone and untouched... you could be doing them a great favor, and/or saving yourself from a punitive visit from a Warden or police.</p>

<p>And leave stubs and hollowed-out nests where they are.</p>

<p>And don't take anything large, of course!</p>

"Venomous/Semi-Venoumous Snakes at Higher Altitudes","3616","","<p>When we camp in rainforests or even country side forest, we are supposed to be very careful about Reptiles, especially Snakes. In India out of the many venomous snakes, I have found Pit Vipers to be very common.<br>
That is why I have always considered the possible threats while choosing a campsite.<br>
But at Higher altitudes, like the Himalayas I do not have any information regarding their habitats. If I google it, I may get the information that I need. But, as far as I know and what I have learnt about Vipers, is, they have an organ called Jacobson's Organ which makes them to sense the heat signatures.  </p>

<p>In regions around Mt. Everest (where I will be going), in Sagarmatha National Park, they have <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloydius_himalayanus"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> Himalayan Pit Viper. I have confirmed that from a friend who is a Herpetologist and has worked in that region but never have had a chance to study the Himalayan Pit Viper.</p>

<p>For my question, this himalayan pit viper is just an example in case of Himalays, there can be many other species than Pit Vipers. I chose to ask w.r.t this because it is commonly found there. In other parts of the world, I believe there are Venomous Snakes, for that matter this question can also be taken as part where it generally snows!</p>

<p><strong>My question is:</strong> If it is true about Pit Vipers being able to trace the heat signatures, does camping in the areas where it snows unsafe? Because, when it snows, it's obviously cold, and so is our body temperature. Yet, will one such reptile be able to trace the heat signature?</p>
","<p>The key to survival of any species in any part of the world is having a sustainable source of food. This applies to snakes as well.</p>

<p><em>For snakes, humans are not food</em>. For them, rats, lizards, scorpions, frogs etc act as food. When you specifically talk of snow covered areas, it is impossible for a snake to live. Or any cold blooded animal for that matter.</p>

<p>I know for a fact that snakes are found in the Himalayan region. Some of them are: Kraits, Naja najas, Pit vipers etc. All of these are found in regions having vegetation (thereby providing a source of food).</p>

<p>Hence, if you are camping in snowy areas, you need not be worried about the snakes. But I would suggest that you take precautions while camping in areas like Leh/Ladakh. These areas do have snakes, although the density is much lesser than what you would find in the Kumaon/Gharwal regions.</p>

<p>General rule of thumb is, mountains with good amount of vegetation or foothills of mountains with vegetation can have snakes. Mountains covered with snow cannot have a sustainable population of snakes.</p>

","<p>First step is to try to find out what, among what you have, they do like.  Maybe they hate freeze dried beef stroganoff but like freeze dried spaghetti and meat balls.  To the extent you can without being totally unfair to the rest of the party, give them more of what they like, even if it means you have to eat more beef stroganoff, which you don't like either.  They must like the trail mix and the chocolate and the cheese....let them have somewhat more than their share of that, but not all of it. </p>

<p>If a modest effort at accommodation doesn't work, treat them as you would a bratty child -- which is what they are.  Tell them:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I know this isn't Cordon Bleu cuisine, but it is what we have.  Eat it
  or starve. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The rest of you have to be united in this approach. </p>

<p>After a few days, maybe step up the pace of the trip.  If they get hungry enough, they will eat.  Do <strong>not</strong>, repeat, do <strong>not</strong> worry about their starving. </p>

<p>It is usually impractical to split up, because the party usually has only one stove and one of some other essentials.   </p>

<p>Lastly, never travel with them again.  </p>

"What makes certain mountains more dangerous than others?","3590","","<p>Why do mountains like K2, Nanga Parbat and Annapurna (36 successful attempts, 47 failed) have higher fatality rates than, say, Everest or Cho Oyu (79 successful attempts, 28 failed)? <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest_mountains#List"">(source)</a></p>

<p>Can I use these statistics to determine what aspect of mountaineering is the most dangerous, between the summit ridge, sudden weather changes or shaky snow bridges?</p>
","<p>I personally had a similar sort of a question when I first went through similar kind of stats about these mountains. Getting introduced with these stats is different than totally understanding the mountain and the pandora box it opens. For getting acquainted with the reasons for so many failed attempts, one needs to read tactical data and expedition reports. Understanding the weather is not a case because many a times bad weather make a <em>walk in a park</em> kind of a summit go horribly wrong.  </p>

<hr>

<h2>Logistics and Supplies:</h2>

<p>Along with the weather, the location makes it more difficult. These big tough-to-climb mountains are not easily approachable. Consequently, many a times you find the local support (labor would be an inappropriate term to use for these great people) like Sherpas and Porters tough to find, fund and convince to come. So things are too difficult with limited support.</p>

<p>If you compare population of these local services around Mt. Everest with other mountains like K2, Kanchenjunga, etc, you would definitely get higher numbers for Mt. Everest,  Lhotse and Cho Oyu. May be that is one of the crucial reasons for higher ratio of successful summit attempts to Failed attempts. It will be reasonably wrong to correlate this ratio with <em>""The Death to Summit Ratio""</em>. Many a times at these great mountains, failed attempt is death and vice versa. And there is a significant number of expeditions where people actually made a summit and unfortunately passed away on the way down the mountain. Afterall, its not only about standing humbly on the summit, but its more about being there at the top tip and get down the goddamn mountain.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Some Technical Data</h2>

<p>One of the factors that makes K2 so challenging is the sustained technical difficulty. Period! It is like a cone of ice and limestone, and has slopes of 45 degree angles or more. Climbers typically fix up to 2,500 meters of rope on the south side routes, and up to 5,000 meters of rope on the north ridge route. It is a consistently steep pyramid, dropping quickly in almost all directions. Speaking of the weather, the sudden storms are caused in part because the peak is so much higher than the mountains around it, it juts up into the upper layers of the atmosphere and like a rock in a river can create eddies in the jet stream, with good weather on one side of the mountain, and life-threatening conditions on the other. That is not exactly the case for Mt. Everest, it being surrounded by another 2 Eight-Thousanders.  </p>

<h2>Speaking of technical difficulties:</h2>

<p>That said, its a fact that Mt. Everest is not a <em>walk-in-a-park</em> and <em>Any-Rich-Tom-Dick-Harry-can-summit</em> thing either, but apart from void weather and a moderately difficult ice wall before <em>""Hillary's Step""</em>, Mt. Everest unarguably put much less challenges to a summit-optimist at higher shoulders of the mountain where rescue is difficult and unlikely, as compared to that of K2, Eiger, etc.</p>

<p>K2 has its own agenda to deny a summit by means of Serac and Bottleneck above Camp IV. There is no need to even comment about how tough it is.  Once <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Bonington"" rel=""noreferrer"">Chris Bonigton</a> was asked, ""What makes K2 such tough mountain to climb, even than Mt. Everest"". He had replied, ""It's enormous, very high, incredibly steep and much further north than Everest which means it attracts notoriously bad weather,""</p>

<p>On the North face Eiger there is are 2 technical challenges much talked about.
One of them is called ""Hinterstoisser traverse"" named after Andreas Hinterstoisser and the other one is called as <em>""The Traverse of the Gods""</em>. Personally, I had my jaw-dropped when I first watched a documentary on Eiger North Face route. All the North Faces in the Swiss Alps were already climbed, but Eiger had parried away all attempts till it was first climbed on July 24, 1938 by Anderl Heckmair, Ludwig Vörg, Heinrich Harrer and Fritz Kasparek in a German–Austrian party.</p>

<p>I have not read and studied much about Nanga parbat, so it will be inappropriate to comment about the technical difficulties it offer.</p>

<p>For Annapurna the technical difficulty is considered to be graded over Hard Severe for the climbing parts of it. The fact that it is considered as the one of the most sensitive Avalanche-Prone areas, adds more woes to climber's expedition.</p>

<p>Overall, the technical difficulty level, Weather, Local Support altogether make world's few mountains tough ones to scale. The same goes without saying for many other mountains in the world which have considerably lower number of successful summits and a relatively dangerous Death to Summit ratio.</p>

<hr>

<h2>TAT (Turn Around Time), Height Gain and Supply Management</h2>

<p>Its also interesting to compare the height gained from Base Camp to Summit.<br>
Height Gains:</p>

<ol>
<li>From Everest Base Camp (South) to Summit: 3484 m.</li>
<li>From Nanga Parbat Base Camp to Summit: 3800 m (Approximately)</li>
<li>From Annapurna Base Camp to Summit (Annapurna I): 3961 m</li>
<li>From K2 Base Camp to Summit: 4711 m</li>
</ol>

<p>Does the height gain and the distance matter? Yes it does! Because these are all tall mountains and located at a higher altitude, the small change in weather is a major concern and the night sinks in so bad. The actual time for the Summit from the Pre-Summit Camp is a very short time-window. The Expeditions always have (if not, then should have) agreed upon a TAT (Turn Around Time). Turn Around Time is what ethical mountaineers refer as the time, clocking which every expedition member should turn back to the lower camp, no matter how close the summit is.
This window between Start of the Summit attempt and TAT is substantially favorable for an expedition team in case of Everest as compared to the other mountains.</p>

"NIS mounting plate for x-country skis: why only for NNN bindings?","3550","","<p>I see a lot of higher-end cross country skis now have an NIS mounting plate to enable the mounting of bindings without drilling any holes (and easy adjustment).</p>

<p>But why are the only NIS compatible bindings that I can find just for the regular NNN norm? What about SNS Profil and Pilot, and also NNN BC? Is there a technical issue here, or do is have to do with patents?</p>

<p>(I know you can just drill any binding onto a NIS-equipped ski.) </p>
","<p>The first part of your question: ""why non SNS bindings for NIS plates"" seems to be purely a matter of proprietary systems and corporate competition. SNS is Solomon's baby, NIS is a collaborative between Fischer, Rossignol and Rottefella to make a truly Integrated System. Likely, Solomon is not allowed to integrated the NIS plate into their skis, so has little interest in making their bindings work on other's skis.</p>

<p>Rumors occasionally surface suggesting Solomon is working on their own adjustable system (that may or may not work with NIS) but to date, nothing has been produced.</p>

<p>As for NNN BC - since NIS and NNN share the same blood, it seems likely the lack of NIS BC bindings is due to structural reasons. BC bindings are tougher for the torque you find in typical Back-Country settings, and you'll probably want a ski that goes with it (wider, metal edges, etc). Also, perhaps the adjustable NIS plate couldn't handle truly BC type skiing (this is just conjecture).</p>

By Gordon G. Giesbrecht, James A. Wilkerson, the treatment gained popularity in the Napoleonic Wars because </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>rapid rewarming from open campfires or other sources of dry heat
  caused so much devastation.....Dry heat from ....open fires....cannot
  be controlled. Excessively high temperatures are usually produced,
  resulting in a combined burn and frostbite, a devasting injury that
  leads to far greater tissue loss.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This treatment is not advocated by modern medicine. According to <a href=""http://www.surviveoutdoors.com/reference/frostbite.asp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Survive Outdoors, Inc</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Until the 1950’s frostbite treatment consisted of rubbing snow over
  the affected area. However in 1956, Merryman disproved this treatment
  intervention. He instead encouraged the public health service medical
  officer in Tanana, Alaska to try rapid re-warming, with great
  success--Hence, the beginning of a new and effective treatment for
  frostbite.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Edit in response to comment from @imsodin</strong>, who said ""rapid re-warming could be misinterpreted"".  True.  <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/frostbite/basics/treatment/con-20034608"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Mayo Clinic</a> site says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Gently rewarm frostbitten areas. Soak hands or feet in warm water — 99
  to 108 F (37 to 42 C) — for 15 to 30 minutes. If a thermometer isn't
  available, test the water by placing an uninjured hand or elbow in it
  — it should feel very warm, not hot.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/frostbite/basics/treatment/con-20034608"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Mayo Clinic</a> site also says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don't rub the affected area and never rub snow on frostbitten skin.</p>

<p>Thus, not only rubbing with snow, but rubbing with anything, is a no-no for frostbite.  Rubbing will further damage already damaged tissues. </p>

"How to be safe on lake and river ice and what should I do when I fall through?","3503","","<p>It's late October and in cold, northern hemisphere climates, winter has arrived, and moderate northern hemisphere climates will follow soon. In my area, small lakes are already frozen and people have been ice-skating already. The rivers and large lakes will freeze soon, too.  Fresh, blank ice can be amazing for ice-skating, ice-biking or just walking on the ice. Snow-covered ice is often passed through when skiing or snow-mobiling. But ice can be quite dangerous, certainly in the beginning of the season.</p>

<ul>
<li>From a safety point of view, what should one always carry along when crossing lake and river ice?</li>
<li>What should I do when I fall through such ice?</li>
</ul>

<p>My question covers all, from small ponds to long rivers to big (>100 km²) lakes.</p>
","<p>When it's possible you will be crossing ice on your route, there is a couple of stages:</p>

<p><strong>Planning at home</strong></p>

<p>First of all, you should explore the area of your trip. The question is are the water sources frozen and how thick is the ice</p>

<ol>
<li>Small lakes in the forest, where there is no winds and no water flow, freeze first. If you know that a couple of small lakes in the area froze a week or two ago, then you can assume that all the other have probably frozen too.</li>
<li>Big lakes, which are visible from satellites, can be checked directly on MODIS <a href=""http://lance-modis.eosdis.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/imagery/realtime.cgi"">daily satellite images</a>. After you find the lake on the image (which is difficult) you can tell if it's frozen by its color: white is frozen, dark is open water. If the lake is frozen, you should check a week or two back to see if it was already frozen and there were any chances for the ice to thicken.</li>
<li><p>Very big lakes (like, >100 km^2) may be partially frozen for months. You can see it on the images. You'll have smooth white fields near the shores (fixed ice), dark open water in the middle, and mixed dark/white pattern in between - floating ice. The trick is that fixed ice may split off and start floating any time, if it's near the edge (and sometimes far from the edge too). On the other hand, sometimes local authorities publish ice coverage maps for very big lakes.</p></li>
<li><p>Rivers are very treacherous. You can examine other rivers to roughly estimate that there is (or isn't) <em>some</em> ice on your river, but you should concider width and speed of the current. But river ice is not uniform and most rivers have areas open during the whole winter (where the current is faster and at shallow places). They may be very hard to detect, so you'd better just cross rivers and avoid walking <em>along</em> the river.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>And give the ice some time to thicken. This depends on the temperature much. I'm not going to give any numbers here, each case is unique.</p>

<p>If you are going far from home, it's wise to ask locals about ice situation.</p>

<p><strong>Estimating on the spot</strong></p>

<p>Now you are following your route and have a (probably) frozen water in front of you. It doesn't mean you <em>have</em> to cross it. First, think it over again, because going back is less evil than dying or having your chilblain fingers amputated.</p>

<p>Check if there is any trace of open water. Avoid areas, where snow seems darker or lower. Avoid areas near water plants and rocks. If it's spring, avoid areas near shores (they unfreeze faster). Stop right away if you feel vibration or hear cracking. Never test ice strength with a kick of you foot, use a long pole instead (this applies mostly to crossing rivers, because you are not going to strike with a pole after each step on a big lake).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, <strong>there is no method</strong> to test that the ice is 99% safe. You are the closest when you know that a couple of people (N times as heavy as you/your party) have crossed it 5 minutes ago, but still...</p>

<p>Yes, you can use an ice screw to test ice thickness, but you can't do it all the time.</p>

<p><strong>Alleviating the concequences of accidents</strong></p>

<p>If you have fallen into the water, it's very difficult to escape yourself: </p>

<ol>
<li>you are cold</li>
<li>you get stiffer every second</li>
<li>you may panic</li>
<li>ice is too slippery and/or too fragile to climb</li>
<li>your clothes and equipement (backpack, skies) make it much worse</li>
<li>there may be underwater currents pulling you under the impenetrable ""roof"" of thick ice</li>
</ol>

<p>The main advice is</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Have another person</strong> following (<em>but not closely!</em>).</li>
</ul>

<p>He will have much more chances to help you. He should have a rope ready (you too, because <em>he</em> might accidently fall). He should not come too close to avoid following you into the water. He should be quick. You both shouldn't panic. He will have much better success starting fire (or calling ambulance).</p>

<p>Other advices are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Drop your equipement as fast as possible (your backpack's belt should be unfastened all the time and you ski binding should allow underwater unfasteneing). Drop your heavy clothes too, it's wet anyway.</li>
<li>Have a personal awl (a sharp metallic piece with a handle) very accessible (like hanging at your sholder) to climb slippery ice. Or at least use youe ski poles, etc.</li>
<li>Have matches/lighter in a waterproof package close to skin, so that you can start a fire immediately after rescue.</li>
<li>If it's possible, have an inflatable boat with you (I mean, inflated and tied to a roap in your hand). A warm diving suit + lifejacket + a boat make crossing not-so-frozen lakes quite easy and safe (tried it myself).</li>
</ul>

<p>When you are out it's very important to get warm ASAP. And if the warming has to be delayed, move intensively. If you don't feel your fingers, swing your arm/leg about 50 times like a pendulum with full force. If you still can't feel the fingers, you can only save them by <strong>slowly</strong> warming it. And, yes, fingers are not as important as life.</p>

<p><strong>Bottom line</strong></p>

<p>Ice safety is very complex and this topic can't cover anything.</p>

<p>Take ice seriously. Really. It's deadly and it's not an exaggeration. Lots of unprepared people fall and die each winter. And I know half a ski-tour group with an experienced leader drown two years ago on a big lake. I know two sportsman lost their fingers after unsuccessfully crossing a small river. I know a very experienced and fully prepared man escaped just with a couple of deep cuts on his face - he was lucky.</p>

<p>If you seriously plan crossing ice in a remote area, please be prepared, find a book or big article on the subject, consult with an experienced one and use your brains.</p>

<p>And still it's solely your responsibility.</p>

"What hazardous wildlife is there in the UK?","3469","","<p>And what situations should I try and avoid in regards to wildlife and areas prone to hazards in the UK?</p>

<p>Edited my question to cover the other answers more as they were very good additions to the wildlife aspect.</p>
","<p>In the UK we have, comparative to other countries, very few venomous creatures. However the false widow and adders are still a risk. </p>

<p><strong>False widows</strong> have mostly been recorded in the South of England and Wales (though I've personally never seen one) but have been recorded to have bitten and hospitalise people, whilst this maybe when out and about it has also occurred when people are asleep in their own homes. There are other spiders that are capable of biting humans, but of the 650 or so species in the UK only 15 or so can do so. False widows are also considered non aggressive.</p>

<p><strong>Adders</strong> are the only venomous snake in Britain (and again after 25+ years here I have never seen one, only a common and harmless grass snake) however the NHS still records roughly 100 cases of bites in a year. They are more common to heathland and sea cliffs. Be wary if you have a dog out with you as there are reported dog deaths and dogs being bitten by Adders in the UK as well. They will likely only bite when feeling threatened, and if you do see one in the countryside, just be careful, avoid handling and let them be. <strong>(I have now actually seen one! Slithered across the grass when walking the dog, 26 years it took to see one!)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Deer</strong> should be treated respectfully in the UK if you happen to see any of the species (Personally saw a young Roe deer buck holding some rutting ground in my local forest.) We have Red, Roe, Fallow, Sika, Water deer as well as Reeve's muntjac. Some of the larger deer obviously have antlers over the autumnal months and can be agressive during the rutting season but the likelihood is when out walking they will run from you - the issue here is being careful at night when driving they can come running out across the road (happens to me at least once a month) and they can go through a windscreen if hit. Also for dogs not used to deer, chasing them (also known as worrying) can lead to conviction and fines.</p>

<p><strong>Badgers</strong> should be avoided whilst out night walking, again more commonly when out with dogs, due to their ability to destroy footpaths / walking routes with their dens. Near where I live badgers have almost completely collapsed a footpath by digging dens underneath it, which is something to watch out for. The likelihood of seeing one would be slim however, but dogs who like running down holes should have an eye kept on them. As a note they also are likely to be a bTB carrier (bovine tuberculosis).</p>

<p><strong>Cows and Bulls</strong> are however a very common cause of injury when out in the British countryside. Cows can stampede when they feel threatened, especially when they have calves in the field. There were 215 injured and 6 deaths recorded in the UK between 2008-2011 due to being trampled by cows. However a good farmer will always signpost a Bull field or when cows have calves - allowing you to enter <em>'At your own risk'</em> or leaving you to take another route.</p>

<p><strong>Wild boar</strong> were reintroduced in 2004 to the Forest of Dean, there have been reports of damage to gardens, and attacks on walkers, dogs, and riders in the area.</p>

<p>Some people can worry about their dogs as <strong>Myxomatosis</strong> is a threat in the UK to British rabbits, but it is not a threat to dogs or humans, but is to pet rabbits so try not to handle wild injured rabbits if you see them unless aiming to take them to a vet or the RSPCA for treatment - and if you do this, anti-bacterial hand sanitizers will help prevent spread of infection.</p>

<p><strong>Fleas and ticks</strong> are also common both domestically and in the countryside in the UK and they can be nasty for both humans and dogs, and Lyme disease can be passed onto humans by ticks.</p>

<p>There is also a debate / request you can find online and that comes up in wildlife searches for the reintroduction of Wolves to Scotland - however currently there are no wolves in the UK.</p>

<p>Edit: <strong>Seagulls</strong> can also be a pest when eating along the coast as they can swoop down grab food from your hand, as they can get quite large these birds shouldn't be hand fed or encouraged. </p>

I'm curious both in terms of utilising existing common equipment, such as torches, and in terms of any new or unusual lights that might be used specifically for this purpose (or others of course.)</p>
","<p>My own preferred method is to use a <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00BMMF83O"">UCO candle lantern</a> attached to the loop in the ceiling, it generates light that radiates outward, and also generates enough heat to make the tent enjoyable when you're settling in for the night.  </p>

<p>I combine the above with a headlamp for personal reading.</p>

"What to do when a moose blocks the trail?","3457","","<p>We were hiking in Colorado a couple of weeks ago (i.e., mid-June).  One day, I took Trail A and my husband took Trail B.  As he rounded a bend, he saw a moose on the trail about 50 feet away.  He stopped.  The moose did nothing.  He continued walking towards the moose. When he got to about 30 feet from the moose, the moose ambled off the trail, and, partially screened by trees, started eating.</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>Other than neglecting to take a picture, did my husband do anything wrong in this encounter with a moose?  (That is, was he dumb?) Should he have waited at the 50 foot range (when he first saw the moose) for the moose to leave?  Waved his arm?  Spoken or shouted?  Or is a slow-ish, confident approach good?  (I would have stopped, taken a picture, and waited until the moose left.)    </p>
","<p>Having been around moose before, I would say that is would have been better to either stop and wait for the moose to leave or swing in a wide loop around the moose. In some areas like <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/grte/planyourvisit/wildview.htm"">Grand Teton National Park</a>, it is illegal to approach closer than 25 yards and you can be given a ticket. </p>

<p>I have never seen moose act aggressively towards a human, but I figure that anything that outweighs me by a factor of 5-10 times has the right of way.</p>

"Camping with a dog for the first time","3451","","<p>In a few months my fiance and I will be joining two friends camping. My friends chocolate labrador will be joining us for the weekend. My fiance and I, whilst both dog lovers, have no experience camping with a dog. </p>

<p>We have a decent four man tent with a large living area, which you can easily stand upright in and a bucket ground sheet. So there should be plenty of room for the four of us and the dog.</p>

<p>The dog is well trained but as a chocolate lab is rather excitable at times and has a tendency to want to play with wild animals (especially squirrels!). </p>

<p>What would be a good way to:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Keep her entertained in the tent whilst we are not hiking?</p></li>
<li><p>Keep her free to move at night but not allow her to escape and run amok?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Edit: Just to say this is regular camping (not wild) but would likely be on farmland in North Wales.</p>

<p>Second edit: Also predominantly on the first night we won't have hiked at all and we would have driven for a few hours so she will likely be excitable then, as stated by both answers and comments I understand she will be knackered after our main days hiking.</p>

<p><em>Just an addition</em> as I made some assumptions which lead to some confusion (I'll know better next time I ask a question), firstly that it would be understood a bucket groundsheet is separated from the main tent - this assumption is due to the bi-annual tent show we go to never having a connected groundsheet for 4 man or larger tents so my apologies there! And also for the confusion about where the dog would have to sleep as leaving her outside the tent in the UK is not an option (despite the high chance for rain, we wouldn't want a kind soul calling the RSPCA on us for neglect, or risk her running off, or the slim chance she would be stolen...) so apologies for that confusion also.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> From advice from some family friends we're staging a trial run in a few weekends to see how the dog gets on with our tent (and allow us to prep it) thanks again for all the wonderful answers / advice here.</p>
","<p>I regularly backpack overnight with two dogs (one is a great dane / lab mix) in the US.</p>

<ol>
<li>A tired dog is a good dog. I have an advantage of several miles of hiking in, but you can still tire the dog out when you get there. A frisbee (flying disc) and swimming works well for my big guy (the lab mix), my smaller girl is tired from the hike itself. Whatever works for the dog, it's well worth bringing along.</li>
<li>Don't leave the dog alone in the tent. At all. Not even for a minute It's a great way to have a torn up tent.</li>
<li>Staking the dog on a long lead may work well in farmland in North Wales. I backpack in the Sierra Nevada mountains (bear and mountain lion country), so my dogs are not tied up ever when we pack. We do a patrol of the campsite before bed (I use a flashlight), and then my dogs spend the night in the tent with me. Most nocturnal animals stay far from the tent because they smell the dogs, and our food never comes near the tent site, so that doesn't attract anything.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'll echo the advice on a bed for the dog. I tried to skimp on a mattress for them because I didn't want to pack it in. Guess what -- two dogs totaling over 75 kg can easily shove you off your pad during the night, and the ground is very hard and cold. Now I <em>always</em> pack that dog mattress and we all sleep better. :)</p>

"How should I vet belayers? What should I look for?","3443","","<p>The other night I went to the climbing gym, intending to look for a climbing partner once I got there. (My usual gym climbing partner isn't available to climb as often as I want to.) The gym provides a whiteboard where you can write your name if you're looking for a partner.</p>

<p>A woman came up to me and offered to climb. She said she was there with a friend, but the friend didn't know how to belay. This was my only real clue that she herself might be inexperienced as a belayer -- probably the two of them were mainly there to boulder. I checked that she had the card tied to her harness that the gym gives you if you've passed their belay test. I belayed her on a climb, and then she belayed me. The belay device was a grigri.</p>

<p>When I was ready to be lowered after finishing the climb, she initially dropped me about half-way down the wall at very high speed, then suddenly stopped me and lowered me much more slowly the rest of the way. When I got to the bottom, she was very embarrassed and apologetic. She apparently hadn't understood how to control the speed when lowering with the grigri, and had probably just pulled the lever back all the way and let go with her hand on the brake strand. She left immediately after this.</p>

<p>Does anyone have suggestions on how to screen potential belayers in a situation like this, and what to do if they seem inexperienced? The best thing I'm coming up with so far, other than checking for the belay card, is to ask explicitly how experienced they are. (A lot of people seem to ask, ""How long have you been climbing?,"" which is probably a nice neutral way of getting this kind of information.) Then if they say they're inexperienced, I can give them a quick mini-review.</p>
","<h3>Be observant</h3>

<p>If you go to the gym often take note of who the regulars are and their general abilities. You aren't going to know everyone's name but you might get a rough idea of their capabilities. This will give you introduction lines like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I haven't seen you around here very much. Are you new?</p>
  
  <p>I noticed you mostly stick to bouldering. Last week this lady almost dropped me. Do you mind if we run through a quick refresher together?</p>
  
  <p>I noticed you have been working XYZ route with your partner. Just incase you haven't seen me belaying people do you want me to demonstrate my belay technique?</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Experienced doesn't mean experienced with a GriGri</h3>

<p>I climbed for quite a while before I handled a GriGri. Instead of asking if they're experienced, <strong>ask if they're experienced with a GriGri</strong>. In the comments <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/users/3277/david-richerby"">David Richerby</a> nicely expanded this idea:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Asking ""Are you experienced in [this specific skill]?"" rather than ""Are you experienced in [this general area]?"" is excellent advice for almost any situation. Don't assume that somebody who is generally experienced necessarily has experience with the specific thing you need.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Ask to join a group instead</h3>

<p>Scout a few pairs and notice how comfortable they are on belay. When you're comfortable with their abilities explain your situation and ask if you could join their group. This strategy admittedly works better if you're moderately social so you aren't walking up to them completely cold. I know I'd help out a friend in that situation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hi Erik and Ben, my partner couldn't make it tonight do you mind if work this route with you guys for a little bit?</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Look at their gear</h3>

<p>You can tell a lot about a climber based on the gear that they wear. Does the person have really worn shoes, and a brand new harness? Either the person just got a new harness or they've been mostly bouldering. Does the person have a harness with nut tool dangling on the back? Odds are the person is doing some trad climbing outside of the gym. </p>

<hr>

<p><a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/users/2199/roflo"">Roflo</a> also added a comment about weight disparities. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'd like to add that I've seen long-time belayers struggle when faced with a climber that's considerably heavier than they're used to. I even recall one guy saying something like ""be careful, I'm heavier than I look"" to every new belayer he met.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you think you're a deceptively heftier person than the average you might want to consider mentioning it.  Ideally the belayer would be extra vigilant for those kinds of things with a new partner, but that obviously isn't always the case.</p>

"When rock climbing, what is the difference between top-roping and leading?","3443","","<p>I'm starting to learn how to rock climb, and there seem to be two types of climbing, top-rope climbing and lead climbing. What's the difference between the two, and what would be better for a beginning climber?</p>
","<h2>Top Roping:</h2>

<p>Top roping has an anchor at the top of the climb. The rope goes from the belayer at the bottom, all the way up to the top, through the anchor, and back down to the climber. If the climber falls, he or she only falls they only drop a little bit, provided the belayer has taken up all the slack. Additionally, the belayer pulls the rope up and brings it <strong>in</strong> to take up slack on the climber.</p>

<p><strong>Top roping is most definitely the way to go for a beginner.</strong></p>

<h2>Lead Climbing:</h2>

<p>With lead climbing, the rope isn't always above the climber. Using fall protection either attached permanently to the wall, or placed by the climber, the climbing climbs, and periodically clips the rope into the protection as he or she ascends. If the climber falls, they will fall a distance equal to twice their height above their last placed anchor, plus the amount that the rope stretches, which may be a significant distance. Opposite to top-roping, in lead climbing the climber pulls the rope up, and the belayer lets the rope <strong>out</strong> to allow the climb.</p>

"Paracord rope strength","3441","","<p>I have recently come into possession of many thousands of feet of paracord, more than any practical use would dictate. So this started me down the addictive path that is weaving and forming it into various more practical or at least decorative uses. One of the extremely easy knitting styles using a spool loom allows for some pretty elaborate rope design, and also allows for compact bundling of cordage into ropes that unspool into much longer cord lengths. Since this is ultimately still one strand just doubled back x times per pin in the loom, I would assume it gains no strength in this process, and by nature of all the additional bend radii I would further assume that it actually looses some strength in this process...</p>

<p>So what I would like to know is there any definable equation / references by which one can calculate the relative strength of a rope constructed of single cords in relation to the knit?</p>

<p>I am not looking to make climbing rope or push its limits, I never really see this being used as anything more than novelty items like leashes, gear holding, bracelets, and gun slings. I am just curious what the deduction is from the 550# relative strength of the cord to start with and how much it decreases with a 2 pin knit vs a 3 pin, 5, etc... Just so I would have some frame of reference if any of it ever had to be load bearing.</p>

<p><strong>Errata:</strong>
An example of the rope in question, this is a three plat knit using single cord over three pins in a spool loom. It produces a rope diameter of about 1"" and compacts the cord about 4.5""(ish) per link, so 50' of <em>rope</em> is actually a manageable 200+ length of cord. <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/20Qst.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/20Qst.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xRr4i.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xRr4i.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Original milspec 550 cord, I looped some over a limb, supported my body weight (190#) and only a few inches off the ground, bounced as hard as I could in effort to test its breaking strength, it held with no obvious signs of damage.</p>

<p>So though I would never climb on a homemade rope as a first choice, it seems it would not be an issue if I <em>did</em> need to, it is somewhat stretchy, I got about a 2' stretch out of about 20 feet of rope before it seemed to hold me in a solid position.</p>

<p>Using that homemade loom and a Philips head screwdriver as a tool, I made about 25' in an evening, so practical way to store a decent length of cord...</p>
","<p>You'll need to test to be sure, but it will lose quite a bit of strength.</p>

<p>When I sailed, I was taught that you lose as much as 80% strength by tying a knot. So if you have 500 lb paracord, by this estimate it could support about 100 pounds reliably when knotted. The weakening is at the point of the knot, so multiple knots doesn't further decrease the strength, it just gives you more probable failure points, all at 20% of the original strength. </p>

<p>The problem here is that the 80% loss is a conservative rule of thumb. That's good if you need to plan for something where your life depends on the line NOT breaking, but your knotted rope can probably hold more than 20% of it's rated strength.</p>

<p>I found a rope maker who <a href=""http://www.neropes.com/Resources/sail_reprint.pdf"">tested some of their own ropes</a>, and described both the testing protocol and the results. The result was that you lost between 35% and 68% of a rope's strength, depending on the type of line and the knot. Splices lost significantly less strength, but since you aren't splicing that's not really relevant. There are probably other lines and knots that lose even greater strength.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>This answer is about an unbroken cord with a knot in it. Rope is designed to be strongest when all fibers in it are straight, so the bent fibers, while bent, are significantly weaker than the surrounding straight fibers. The more severe the bend, the greater the weakening. If you untie the knot, the rope goes back to being straight and regains its strength. </p>

<p>The picture looks like any weight on the braided cord would be supported by the equivalent of multiple strands, and the braid might not compromise the rope's strength as severely as a true knot.</p>

<p>Braiding a single cord as you did functions kind of like wrapping a line between two anchor points several times. Any force placed on the ends will pull on all the bends, so the full force won't be on any single bend. In your picture, the force would probably be distributed between several bent strands, so it could support several times what a single knotted cord would support. But all this means is that if you really want to know, you need to test it. </p>

<p>I know I might have to struggle first couple times as I am only beginner and this skis is made for intermediate - advanced skiers. </p>

<p>What do you guys think? Any suggestions and recommendations will be highly appreciated :) </p>
","<p>This is a very personal, subjective thing, and I don't think anybody can tell you exactly what type or even style of ski to get when you're first starting out. The perfect ski depends on how much you weigh, how that mass is distributed, what types of conditions you typically ski in, whether you ski on groomed paths or narrow trails, and many other considerations. For that reason, the advice I would give you is, <em>don't</em> buy your skis right away, and <em>do</em> rent some so you can get a feel for what works best for you. To make a brief analogy, I wouldn't rush out to buy a fancy road bike if I wasn't sure yet if I'd rather go mountain biking or road biking a lot. </p>

<p>Renting skis gives you the opportunity to try many different styles and sizes without having to make a long-term investment. You might inquire with local shops as to whether they have any discount program for repeated rentals. After you determine what kind of skis you really like, then you can start considering buying some. </p>

<p>Another thing to check out are ski swaps and discounted gear sales. You don't necessarily <em>need</em> brand-new skis to start out with; in fact, many experienced skiers primarily buy used gear. You could easily get 2 pairs of used skis for the same price as 1 pair of new skis, and having two different types of skis will give you more flexibility for different snow conditions and types of ski routes. </p>

","<p>I don't have personal experience with black bears, but only brownies.</p>

<p>If you encounter a bear in 10 meters away from you that means you surprised it or the bear is coming after you. In a night scenario with a whistle and flashlight the surprise cannot be a real life case. That means bear is actually after you and that's very bad.</p>

<p>Black bear may want to hunt you down and eat or flashlight itself attracted the bear to check on you. Bears are curious animals and many things may attract them. At least I saw many bears coming to camp just to check out who's had a fire going.</p>

<p>With any bear in any encounter the key is not to anger the beast. Your flashlight will not blind the bear, neither will strobe. It will just make you to look like a threat and enrage the bear. And the gold rule is to never ever to piss off the bear.</p>

<p>Using the light to make you look bigger is the way to go. Since bear came to you backing away will not work, the bear will follow. That means you need the bear to loose interest in you. If bear decides to abandon you because you are big and scary or it satisfied its curiosity that's a win. If that didn't worked and it gets aggressive and especially charges throw you flashlight. To the ground next to bear or in to a bear targeting nose if it's already charges. It will have bear occupied for a while. And you can slowly back off. Or if the bear was after the flashlight it will go away once it chewed it.</p>

<p>If that didn't work apply standard self defence. Pepper spray and fighting back with that ever means you have.</p>

<p>Then there are the following already mentioned benefits indoors: Big pool of climbing partners, lots of courses, easy access, independent from weather and probably more. The last point makes it very suitable to learn the basics of or improve strength for climbing.</p>

<p>However if all of the above is not a problem and your goal is to climb outdoors and for mountaineering, learning to climb outdoors has its distinct advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Route finding/knowing rock:<br>
Indoors the route is given with colourful plastic things. Well, you don't have that outdoors. The sooner you learn to recognize usable holds and fit placements the better. And while bolts will lead your way, you still get a feeling for lines which is one of the most important factors on alpine climbs.</p></li>
<li><p>Climbing style<br>
Indoor climbing focuses a lot on holds and strength. Outdoor climbing is much more about feet and friction, also for holds. This is really a huge factor. Lots of indoor climbers climb harder routes after a short time of intense training than I do, but outside I still surpass them.</p></li>
<li><p>""Habits""<br>
Checking whether the hold is loose before putting your weight on it, recognizing potential dangers like ledges and many other small factors will become a habit the sooner you stay doing them.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So start climbing now indoors, learn rope handling, build endurance and strength and whatever else, but as soon as it is possible, go climb outside. In addition to the factors above, it is also much more fun ;)</p>

"How to treat a severe allergic reaction while hiking?","3389","","<p>Suppose you are out hiking, many hours from the trail head and someone has a severe allergic reaction (ie, anaphylactic shock or Anaphylaxis).  In this case, what is the best course of treatment to maximize their chance of survival until they can reach a hospital?</p>
","<p>Anybody who has severe allergies which could lead to anaphylaxic shock should carry appropriate medication with them. Typically, that would consist of:</p>

<ul>
<li>An antihistamine (e.g. benadryll)</li>
<li>An epinephrine auto-injector (aka ""Epi-Pen"")</li>
</ul>

<p>Benadryll is available over the counter and you should have it in your first aid kit. Epi is by prescription only (at least in the US), so the individual who has allergies should carry their own. If you're leading a large group, you may be able to get a prescription and standing orders for trained staff to carry and administer epinephrine to group members. </p>

<p>Many people think that just injecting epi when somebody has an anaphylactic attack is the entire treatment. It's important to know that <em>epinephrine does not fix the underlying issue!</em> It only helps to reduce swelling, helping to re-open the airway. You <strong>must</strong> fix the cause of the reaction! </p>

<p>As soon as an exposure to a known allergen occures &ndash; even if the person isn't having a visible reaction &ndash; you need to <em>immediately</em> have the person take an antihistamine. Antihistamines are drugs that suppress the histamine response, i.e. the body's overreaction to an antigen. This is what actually reduces the severity of the allergic reaction itself. Correct dosage depends on the person; consult the instructions on the antihistamines or talk to a doctor. </p>

<p>The important consideration with an allergic reaction is maintaining a clear airway. If you get the antihistamines into the patient immediately, it's possible that the reaction will be contained and the patient will not develop anaphylaxis. In the event that they do develop anaphylaxis, that's where you need to monitor their airway and administer epi if necessary. If the patient is having difficulty breathing, encourage them to take deep, calm breaths, and to pace their breathing off yours. </p>

<p>If the patient is unable to maintain a clear airway, be prepared to administer epinephrine. Epi-pen trainer kits are widely available through first aid training programs, so if you expect to be traveling in the wilderness with people who may require epi, you should do the training. The auto-injectors have clear instructions on them; typically you just remove the blue cap, place the orange end of the auto-injector on their thigh, push down hard on the epi-pen to trigger the injector, and hold it in place for at least 30 seconds. The epi is administered automatically at the correct dosage. Make sure to carefully follow the directions as individual auto-injectors may vary in how exactly they are administered. Epi wears off after 10-15 minutes, so most people will carry either a dual-injector or two injectors, so that a second dose can be administered if necessary. When injecting, always hold the injector gripped in your fist, do not place anything over either end of the pen to ensure you don't accidentally inject it into yourself!</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z8GHp.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z8GHp.jpg"" alt=""epi pen""></a></p>

<p>Make sure to monitor the patient's vital signs throughout, and continue to monitor their condition after the initial treatment. Ensure that any secondary issues such as bleeding from a bite, etc. are taken care of as well. </p>

<p>Once you've stabilized the patient, you need to start planning for an evacuation. Anaphylactic reactions are life threatening. If you are in a very remote area and have access to an emergency locator beacon or other outside communication, it's appropriate to request emergency assistance. </p>

<p>As always, the most important thing is to be adequately prepared. Understanding the allergies (and other medical concerns) your group members have, what treatment options they have, and how to use them is critical. You should know all of this information for every member of your party <em>before</em> heading into the wilderness, so that if an emergency situation does arise you're already prepared. Most people with medical concerns which could require your immediate intervention will be happy to show you how to handle it should they need your help. In this particular example, epi injectors differ in appearance and operation, and knowing exactly how to use the injectors belonging to members of your party will save you precious time should you actually need to use them. </p>

"What happens when someone dies on Mount Everest?","3385","","<p>I have read that Rob Hall's body (who died very near the summit in 1996) was discovered. However I have not seen any validation of that. I just watched the movie Everest and I'm curious. Has it been confirmed that his body has been found?</p>

<p>When someone dies on Mount Everest, are there attempts made to recover, or track location of bodies? </p>
","<p>Above about 7500-8000meters, currently they are left there. </p>

<p>One opinion based answer is because Everest climbers are selfish. Given many people who climb Everest won't abandon a summit attempt to save a life, do you really think they care enough to risk their life to bring a body off the mountain?  (Current rates are 4% fatality of all summit attempts, presume body retrieval would be similar.)</p>

<p>A more charitable answer is because above about 8000 meters you are in the death zone. You are slowly dying. You have very limited strength, and no reserves. It is impossible to do much more than put one foot in front of the other. You have very limited reserves (weather, food, water, warmth and blood oxygen level) and ""going to plan"" can become life threatening if just a couple of minor issues come up. As such, body retrieval, even if possible, is very dangerous, and more than likely, will just create more bodies. Who would risk their life to retrieve a body - would you? Give the presumed answer, the next moral question is is it right for you to ask someone else to retrieve a body and risk their life?  Given the problem of the difficulty of moving a body, you could perhaps make it possible by bringing the bodies down in pieces small enough for one man to carry, there are a significant number of cultural and moral barriers to this approach.</p>

<p>Even if you decide morally of all that is is OK, you then need to establish a price. There is a minimum cost of probably 1 million dollars (based on 10 men, Everest summit a costs of $100K each). Is it worth spending 1 Million dollars to retrieve a body?  If its not 1 Million dollars, why not - why can you retrieve a body for less than that of when a summit attempt costs over $100K? </p>

<p>Ok, so now we have got past the morals and established the cost, you hire someone, and go up there and they die in the attempt. What are the laws in your country around paying someone to do a job when you knew the job carried very high risk of death?  </p>

<p>So the real question should be ""Given what happens to a body and the fatality rate, why are so many allowed to climb it?""  </p>

<p>Hopefully in time technology will make it practical and safe at a reasonable cost to remove these bodies, till then, its just an accepted fact of the Everest gravy train. </p>

"How do I read a topographic map?","3364","","<p>When navigating in the backcountry, you'll usually bring a topographic map that shows the terrain so you can tell if there will be steep slopes or cliffs that might make the route difficult. </p>

<p>A sample topographic map is:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gVaWx.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>How do I read and understand the map? What do the lines and numbers mean?</p>
","<p>A topographic map, as we see here, is made up of a number of lines.:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Every point on a given line is at the same elevation.</p></li>
<li><p>Where the lines get closer the slope is steeper, and vice versa. But
that doesn't tell you directly which way the slope is going, so they
put numbers on the lines - the slope goes up towards the higher
numbers.</p></li>
<li><p>These numbers indicate the line's actual altitude, this can be height
above sea level or above a particular reference altitude, usually the
lowest or average point in the area.</p></li>
<li><p>The map's legend should tell you what the reference and units are,
from the numbers here I'd guess it's feet above sea level (a mile up,
so perhaps somewhere in Colorado).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The map shown in the question indicates what a number of features look like.  Hills and holes are concentric circles (look at the numbers to figure out which), and when you have lines getting very close or joining (even going under another, see the upper-left corner), that's a cliff. </p>

<p>The path of steepest ascent (or descent) is directly perpendicular to the contour lines; the black lines seem to mostly be following one such path, especially the dashed branches. So if you like a challenge, walk across the lines, if you prefer to stay flat, walk along the lines, and for a gradual ascent, walk somewhere in-between.</p>

"Walking through an active railway tunnel during a long distance walk","3354","","<p>There is a long trail in the mountains near where I live. It requires one to walk through a Railway tunnel which is roughly 1.2 miles long and is not straight.</p>

<p>Usually, there is a margin between the train and the walls of the tunnel. The worst margin I have seen is of 4 ft., but that was with two lines (2 tracks), I can simply go to the other track if the train comes on the track where I am walking. If two trains come, one from each direction, Trouble, I'll have to make sure that I stand still between the two tracks (fundamentally wrong and a bad bad idea) or safer lay down between the two tracks, or at the corner of the tunnel wall.</p>

<p>The bast case margin that I have seen in the same section is of 6-8 ft.
And there are safety alcoves where the maintenance guys stand while the train passes. I am not sure if they are equidistant for all the tunnels. </p>

<p>What are the precautions that one should be taking while using such a tunnel?</p>

<p>Obvious thing: A headlamp and/or a Flashlight is being carried along. Using the tunnel is not entirely legal, but that is not much of an issue either. Railway authorities know that people use the tunnels, but they have never taken an action since the terrain only allows that as a shortest possible way. </p>
","<p>First of all, next time I'm in India I'm gunna give you a call so you can show me where that tunnel is. Second, the only real precaution you need to take is to ensure that in the event of a train encounter, that there is room for the train to pass by safely with you in the tunnel.</p>

<p>I've actually been caught in train tunnel with a train coming the other way. We just laid down beside the tracks against the tunnel wall and waited for the train to pass, then continued on without any problems. </p>

<p>A light would be a luxury, but it's unlikely you can get lost in a train tunnel, and it's not like you're going to be encountering any obstacles that you have to worry about tripping over, or large hole you can fall in. Even with a light I'd probably turn it off and see how far I could go just following the tracks in the dark. You certainly don't have to worry about light when  train comes, those tunnels get <em>really</em> bright when a train rolls through. </p>

<hr>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Another consideration you should probably make, is what side of the tunnel would be best to stand on if you encounter a train at a turn. You said the tunnel wasn't straight, train cars don't stay over the tracks when they round a corner, the ends hang over the outside of the turn, and the middles hang over the inside. On a sharp turn, you may want to retreat to where the tunnel straightens out again. </p>

"What happens to rappel anchors?","3346","","<p>When setting up a rappel anchor, using things like webbing, rings, that kind of stuff, what happens to the anchor when you get to the bottom? Assuming you can't hike to the top and grab it, do you most people leave it behind? I've seen some instances where people don't use artificial anchors, but just wrap the rope around a tree and then pull the rope down when they're done.</p>

<p>It seems awfully wasteful, and against LNT to just leave a bunch of webbing on a rock. Thanks!</p>
","<p><strong>Yes</strong>, it does get left behind.</p>

<p>Descending rings are meant to be used to facilitate the recovery of ropes, they save your rope from getting horribly dirty, damaged, or stuck, and leave much less of an impact than rappelling off of a tree or branch. </p>

<p>Pulling you rope off of a tree will saw into the trunk and leave permanent scars, it could even possibly lead to the eventual death of the tree. </p>

<p>Yes it leaves a trace, but they're fairly inert articles, and it's unlikely that anyone will ever find your sling except for fellow alpinists, they're only typically used for fast descents off long alpine routes in places where there's no other way down (aside from down-climbing, which is how most climbers get into accidents).</p>

<p>If an alpinist finds a descending ring while on a descent, the proper ediquette is to cut the webbing, retire the ring and replace it with one of your own–as it's never advisable to use climbing gear that you don't know the history of–but usually they will inspect the ring and the webbing to see if it's still usable. Someone my reuse it if they feel that it is safe, sometimes they will reuse the ring only but add a sling of they're own, leaving the original sling as a backup. This is when things get messy, when old slings start to pile up, but some responsible climber eventually comes along and cleans the mess.</p>

"How to walk as a roped party on a glacier?","3325","","<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ccUOO.jpg"" alt=""Glacier""></p>

<p>If you want to walk on a glacier you usually do this roped together as a team. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>How to walk as a roped party on a glacier?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What I have to pay attention to when knotting the rope?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Related question: <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/1264/mountaineering-glacial-traverse-rope-up-or-go-it-alone?rq=1"">Mountaineering / glacial traverse: rope-up or go it alone?</a></p>
","<p>First of all: <strong>Walking a glacier contains some serious risks</strong> and roping up is not enough to cover that risks, but also knowledge of crevasse rescue is needed. Therefore <strong>I strongly recommend a glacier course</strong> where all those things are taught.</p>

<p>Now for some basic things to consider when walking a glacier as a roped party:</p>

<p>When walking a glacier, one normally does not place any protection where the rope is fixed or runs through, therefore the only thing to hold a fall of a team member into a crevasse are the other team members. The problem is, that the force exceeded by a falling person attached to your harness can easily tear you down, especially if you have not been awaiting it.</p>

<p>Therefore the base rules are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do not walk a glacier with less than 3 persons on a rope. Some people also go as two-person teams but this is only acceptable under very special circumstances (e.g. glacier known to have little to no crevasses, both are very experienced in glacier walking and crevasse rescue...), but it is not recommended.</li>
<li>The group size should not exceed 6 to 7 persons, otherwise the whole rope party will get rather slow. Bigger groups should be split into several rope parties.</li>
<li>The less people there are in a rope party the more rope should be between them. For a 3 person party, 10 to 12m of rope between them are recommended, for larger groups distances around 8m are OK.</li>
<li>Whenever possible, try to walk through the crevasse zone perpendicularly to the crevasses. Walking parallel is quite risky, especially if they are covered with snow, as crevasses can extend under the surface much longer than they appear.</li>
<li>While walking, do not allow for slack rope between the members. If one is falling into a crevasse and there is slack rope between them and the next member, the falling body is able to gain some speed before the rope tightens and catches the fall. The more speed the body already has, the higher is the chance that other team members are carried away and cannot hold the fall. [1]</li>
<li>For the same reason, one should keep the rope straight, i.e. do not walk zig-zag lines but as straight as possible. If someone falls while the group is taking some zig-zag path, they will get pulled sideways <em>and</em> have again the possibility to gain some speed before the others can catch them.</li>
<li><em>If</em> someone needs some slack rope, for example when they have to jump across a crevasse, they shall tell the members in front and behind them about how much slack is needed. If someone has to jump, the other members should be extra prepared for a fall. </li>
<li>Keep the rope straight as long as you are in crevasse terrain, also during breaks. Gather only when the rope leader has secured a spot with safe ground and commands the team to come up.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another point to know and be aware of is the point where it is better to go everyone on their own instead of roped up. Hard-frozen snow, especially firn does provide nearly no friction. That means that if someone falls on a slightly inclined firn surface, they will immediately gain some speed and if their fall is not stopped immediately, can easily tear away the other members of their rope party. Once this has happened, it is nearly impossible to stop such a sliding rope party as whenever one of them can arrest his fall, the others still falling will tear him away again. The case, that all members are able to arrest at the same time is negligible and will happen only by very rare chance.</p>

<p>This is already the case for rather slight inclines of about 25°.[1] Here the doctrine (at least in the German speaking countries) is that the risk of one member stumbling and taking away the whole rope party outweighs the risk of a crevasse fall (crevasses tend to get less frequent as the terrain gets steeper) and therefore it's better to go unroped at that point.</p>

"When should you repair rock gouges in skis?","3325","","<p>When downhill skiing (although I assume this would apply to cross-country skiing or snowboarding as well), when should a gouge caused by a rock or other obstacle be considered large or serious enough to take the skis in for base repair, and when can it be ignored?</p>
","<p>The two biggest risks from gouges:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Core Shot</strong>: This is when the gouge cuts through the base material* to the core layers of the ski (usually wood or composite material). If moisture gets in between those layers (it will), it can cause the various layers of your ski to separate. This process of de-lamination will rapidly destroy your ski or snowboard and can not be repaired.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Edge Separation</strong>: If the rock catches on your edge enough to pull it out from between the core and base layers, or mangles it enough to create a gap, this can result in several issues: De-lamination (see above), affect turn performance (you have no edge / uneven edge), laceration risk (those things are sharp even when they are in proper position).  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Fortunately, both of these cases can be repaired to nearly good as new if you have the tools/knowhow -- but only before de-lamination begins, so act quickly.</p>

<p>Beyond that, minor scrapes, dings, etc. that don't make it to the core -- even super-long and gnarly looking ones -- are fine up to your personal preference. They will effect your glide, and can affect performance, and might cause excessive snow build-up in adverse conditions, but your skis will be structurally fine.</p>

","<p>Moss grows best in the shade (and damp, but most relevant here is shade). Because of the curvature of the Earth, in the northern hemisphere the north side of trees is shadier than the south side, so if moss grows on only one side of a tree, it is likely to be the north side. In the southern hemisphere, the whole thing is mirrored so the moss is on the south side.

However, sometimes I'm with people who use bladders such as a CamelBak, and I offer to go and fill water bottles, so I have to fill theirs. Maybe I just need to ask them to explain or demonstrate the technique for me, but I find it really slow and difficult to fill those things, especially when I'm filling from a lake or pond. Is there a trick? If I stick the bladder under the surface, it sort of crumples, and when I pull it back up, it's only about 10% full. The best method I've improvised so far is to fill one of my own rigid bottles with water, then pour that into the bladder.</p>
","<p>The answer depends a lot on the style of bladder, there are a couple different styles.</p>

<p>I have a classic camelbak, which has a nalgene sized opening on it and a handle to hang onto for filling one handed, so it's real quick and easy to stick in the water and fill up:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JLEqI.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I've had other types of water bladders though that you had to fold the tops over and slide on a top piece. These types of closures are not as user friendly, but apparently leak less, and are able to hold back a lot of pressure which is why they're used on the fancy <a href=""http://www.geigerrig.com/hydration-packs/accessories-reservoir-bladders-bite-valves-backpacks.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Geigerigs</a>:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8Pmxg.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>These ones aren't super easy to fill in flowing water, you need to use two hands and depending on the flow they tend to spill a lot. Easiest thing is exactly what you were doing, fill a bottle and pour it into the bag, I always carry an extra nalgene, even when I'm carrying my camelbak, it's handy to have for those small streams where you can't seem to get your bladder under the water. </p>

<p>Personally, I prefer the Camelbak twist closure over the slide tops, even though it can be a pain to open if you tighten it too much, and it does drip a bit sometimes, they're just easier to fill.</p>

"How to heal ""blown tips"" faster after a climb?","3296","","<p>I just started rock climbing recently (by the way, it's awesome!). I tend to tear up my fingertips though when climbing on rough rock or for long periods of time. It takes a couple days for them to heal enough to where there's no pain when I press on them (after one day, the pain is minimal, but they re-open easily). Is there any way to help them heal faster?</p>
","<p>Listening to your body is spot on.  Let the finger heal completely before climbing again.  This is very important, as a split tip is very likely to split in the same spot again.</p>

<p>Prevention is very important, and will help keep tips from splitting in the future.  Start by moisturizing the skin regularly, especially after climbing.   Use products like <a href=""http://www.climbonproducts.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Climb On</a> and <a href=""http://www.jtreelife.com/products/healing-salve"" rel=""nofollow"">Joshua Tree Salve</a>: they will help the skin regenerate.  This is very important in the winter when the skin is drier.</p>

<p>You can use an emory board to sand away dead skin; smooth skin is less likely to have a line of weakness that can split.  If you have a big callus that is about to rip, file it down.</p>

<p>Your skin will build up calluses, but it does take time to adapt.  Don't rush it, and keep things progressive.  Pick climbs that don't have extremely sharp holds.  When climbing, make sure your hands stay dry: use chalk to prevent soft skin that can split.</p>

<p>I've heard people using super glue to heal splits, but I've also heard it's a terrible idea from other people.  Tape can also be used over the split, but I find the loss of sensitivity very distracting.</p>

<p>If you are looking for something other than 550 paracord the major questions to ask are what diameter do you need and what strength. Almost any where you go from 550 paracord it will get more expensive. For comparison Mammut is a company that makes climbing rope and rates their rope all the way down to 2mm (which is rated for .85kN) and 2mm is usually around $.10/ft.</p>

<p>For your uses 550 Paracord will probably work best and be cheapest. </p>

"Why do shin splints happen?","3262","","<p>I've gotten shin splints on long hikes - once 2 weeks into a hike, and another time 2 <strong>months</strong>.  I wasn't able to determine how I got them though, which has really annoyed me!  I get that I could probably prevent them with proper stretching or warming up or something, but I'd be just as happy to understand why I would get them well into a trip.  </p>

<p>On the first hike, it was after a really hot day (40C+) but nothing was special about the trail, just pretty easy walking.  My pack was fairly heavy for me, due to lots of water, maybe 35lbs.  I hiked 30km that day.</p>

<p>On the second hike, I got them the day after a very, very rainy day.  On the rainy day I had a quite light pack at ~18lbs, hiked maybe 40km.  </p>

<p>I'm not sure what other details might be relevant.  I would say in both cases I was in reasonably good shape, certainly well past the breaking in period of a long hike.  </p>
","<p>Shin splints (tibial stress syndrome) can be cause by tendons, muscles, or stress fractures. It's an ""overuse"" injury, with multiple causes, so there's not a single treatment. Some things that might help:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Step softly. If you pound your feet when you hike, it can aggravate shin splints.</p></li>
<li><p>Ease up on running a week or two before hiking. Running causes shin splints more than hiking.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have flat feet or overpronation, you might try arch supports.</p></li>
<li><p>Ibuprofen (or other <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nsaid"">NSAID</a>) and ice can help the symptoms.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep your legs warm when you hike. Neoprene calf sleeves can help with this, and the compression may help too.</p></li>
<li><p>Running on hard surfaces (concrete, asphalt) and uneven surfaces can contribute to shin splints. A rubberized track is the best option for running. Since there are not many rubberized hiking trails, good padded soles can help for that.</p></li>

<p>The exact scenario:<br>
We were hiking a ten mile trail on US Forestry Service land with river crossings and came upon an abandoned tent.  It was one of those larger four man, twenty pound tents and damaged beyond use.  We do carry bags that we use to ferry out other trash we find but there was no room in our packs for an extra tent.  </p>

","<p>When it's unsuitable for removal by your group, contact the relevant authority for that land and let them know the type of litter and its location (pictures and GPS coordinates are helpful). For example, in cases of extreme littering, U.S. federal land management agencies will sometimes organize major cleanup efforts to pack out trash with mules or even a helicopter if there is enough litter in a remote area to justify it.</p>

<p>The small leaks should be reasonably easy to fix. Especially if it is just the gelcoat that is damaged rather than a complete hole. The gelcoat is the hard outer waterproof layer which covers the fiberglass. In this case you need some <a href=""http://www.duncanyacht.co.uk/showpartnumber.asp?CategoryID=2463&amp;PartNumberID=48409"">Gelcoat filler</a> or similar. Follow the instructions, clean and sand the surround area and apply the filler.</p>

<p>The large hole will require a bit more work. You'll probably need to make the hole bigger and cut out the surrounding damaged area, sand around it before cutting some glass fibre roll to size (a bit bigger than your new hole). Then apply a resin, either a polyester resin and finish with gelcoat when dry or expoy and no gelcoat (I would probably use expoy, doesn't look as nice but is stronger).</p>

<p>Most boat shops/chandlers sell <a href=""http://www.duncanyacht.co.uk/showpartnumber.asp?CategoryID=2463&amp;PartNumberID=48411"">repair kits</a> which should have everything you need.</p>

<p>I would not worry about resharpening, as from your description there are no steep ice sections on the route. If there are and you like using your own hands, start filing.

Just follow the steps described <a href=""http://www.summitpost.org/so-you-want-to-sharpen-your-tools-eh/179394"">here</a> (will need some imagination as yours looks quite different to begin with).</p>

"What sleep quality do you get in the outdoors?","3225","","<p>I should say I haven't ever done anything very outdoorsy, but I would like to make sleeping outdoors a part of the bicycle touring which I hope to do. But a worry for me is that I have always had problems getting proper sleep even indoors, and I want to make sure that I maintain a healthy lifestyle.</p>

<p>Personally I am very easily distracted by the breeze and by outdoor noise or the general openness (whenever I try to read a book in the park). What is your experience? Would a tent or tarp be better for being closed vs open? Earbuds? Would animal noises be able to wake you up in the night? Is it possible to sleep properly in heavy rain?</p>
","<p>Quality of sleep can depend on a multitude of factors. These are some of my experiences:</p>

<p><strong>Quality and appropriateness of gear</strong></p>

<p>Most people sleep poorly if they get too cold or too hot. Having a quality sleeping bag that is appropriate for your climate and time of year will definitely increase the likelihood that you will get quality sleep. Material matters when it comes to sleeping bags. Down will regulate temperature better, but is useless when it gets wet. Synthetic materials are poor at regulating temperature, but keep you warm even when they get wet. Don't buy cotton.</p>

<p>Having a sleeping pad will contribute to a good night's rest. The ground acts as a heat sink, especially when your sleeping spot is on sand or rock. Forrest duff will act as an insulator, and I will go lighter on the sleeping pad if I know in advance that I will be staying below the timber line. When it comes to sleeping pads, you have a choice between air mattresses and foam pads. The former can be a bit noisier and obviously can be susceptible to leaks, but, in general, is lighter and more comfortable. The latter is cheaper, and can withstand a beating.</p>

<p>Some people sleep best in a tent. Some people sleep best under the open sky, or as close to it as possible. In the summer, I often just bring a tarp in case it rains, since I have a hard time getting up in time if I sleep inside a tent. Tents (or insect nets) are a major plus when setting up camp next to mosquito-infested waters.</p>

<p><strong>Maintenance of gear</strong></p>

<p>If you get wet you will sleep poorly. Make sure you keep your sleeping gear dry. I keep my sleeping bag in a dry-bag to prevent it from getting wet.</p>

<p><strong>Experience</strong></p>

<p>For a couple of years, I have led wilderness trips for children. I have observed a correlation between children who spend time outdoors on a regular basis and getting better night's rest. I suspect this might have to do with being in an unfamiliar environment. On longer trips, most children were sleeping well at the end, probably due to exhaustion and a new-found familiarity with the outdoors.</p>

<p><strong>The human factor</strong></p>

<p>I find that the single most annoying thing for myself when trying to fall asleep in the outdoors are inconsiderate individuals in close proximity. European campgrounds can be very dense, especially during the peak season, and often, at least, one group of individuals does not respect the quiet hours. For that reason, I avoid proximity to others whenever possible. I have a pair of noise-cancelling headphones that I use (they don't have to be plugged into anything) when I find myself in a situation like that. For me, it also helps if I can be next to a source of white-noise, like a creek. When going backpacking, especially in areas where you have some choice when it comes to campsite selection, the ""human factor"" can often be completely avoided. I have been on many trips in the mountains of California's Sierra Nevada where I had the nights completely to myself.</p>

<p><strong>Environmental factors</strong></p>

<p>Many people sleep poorly at elevation. What the elevation is that makes people sleep poorly varies heavily from person to person. In my experience, the slower you gain elevation, the better you will acclimatized, and your sleep quality improves.</p>

<p>I find that heavy rain does not distract me unless I am worried that my stuff could get wet. It helps with ""the human factor"" as well since people generally won't stay up as late in poor weather. It also provides white noise, which helps me sleep. </p>

<p>The elements pretty much tie back to the appropriateness and quality of gear. If I trust that my gear will withstand the situation, I normally sleep soundly.</p>

<p>The sun can be a factor as well. If you would like to sleep in during the summer months, make sure that you set up in a shady spot. There is nothing worse that waking up in your sleeping bag inside a tent that has been baking for 30 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>The unavoidable</strong></p>

<p>I have observed (on myself and others) that often the first night can be rough, even with good gear and a lot of experience.</p>

<p>Your general disposition. If you have trouble sleeping at home, you will probably find the same to be true in the outdoors. If your sleeplessness is due to stress, though, a couple of nights in the outdoors may help wonders.</p>

"Tent floor waterproof rating","3217","","<p>I'm currently looking to buy a new tent. The old one had a floor that was said to withstand a hydrostatic head of 10000 mm, but the tents I find in the stores here go to at most 3000 mm for the floor, at least in the light-weight category. </p>

<p>Is that still sufficient to keep me dry in Pacific Northwest weather? What about camping on snow? </p>
","<p>Hydrostatic rating on a tent is the highest column of water a material can withstand for up to one minute before the water starts to penetrate (assuming good seams, no damage etc)</p>

<p>The ratings translate as follows (have seen these quoted in a couple of places, this is from campingcrazy.com)</p>

<ul>
<li>1000mm or less is considered shower resistant and will soak up rain and get damp after a heavy shower</li>
<li>1500mm is considered the realistic minimum requirement for summer (and mainly dry) camping</li>
<li>2000mm is the recommended minimum if you intend camping in your tent year round</li>
<li>3000mm is mainly used on family tents so they can withstand a couple of weeks of rain!</li>
</ul>

<p>For floors, the thing to watch is that pressure on it can lower the effective hydrostatic head, so if you are camping in very wet areas, a 10000mm rating can be very useful - often this is quoted for the groundsheet, and up to 15cm up the sides of a wet weather tent. If you can't get a high rated tent, just go old school and use a groundsheet under your tent.</p>

"What precautions should I take to protect myself and my camp from bears?","3216","","<p>Most of my prior hiking experience has been in areas that are not home to bears, so what precautions should I take to protect my camp (and myself as I am hiking) from bears.</p>

<p>I am aware of a couple of things, like having a bell or noisemaker on my pack, and hanging my food from a tree.  Are these effective?  I have also seen bear-proof canisters for sale for storing my food.  Are those preferable to hanging it from a tree?</p>
","<p>First of all, <strong>DO NOT</strong> bring <strong><em>anything</em></strong> smelly into your tent. This includes food, tooth paste, deodorant, or anything else that has a smell. Also, keep fires away from the tent.</p>

<p>I recommend setting up a bear triangle campground. Cook your food in one corner, close to that corner–maybe 50 feet away–set up a latrine area. About 200 feet or more away from both, set up your tents. Keep your food in the kitchen area, tied up high.</p>

<p>When hiking, the most important thing to do is to make noise to let the bears know where you are. They don't want to mess with humans in general, but they will if you startle them.</p>

<p>Keep your smelly stuff in some kind of an easy-to-dispose-of container. If a bear attacks you, let go of the smelly stuff, and you are more likely to survive.</p>

"How can I practice Climbing without the actual wall and/or equipment?","3202","","<p>I had never been a gifted kind of a climber being more fascinated by Backpacking than Rock Climbing. Its been almost 2 years that I did some genuine climbing. And, I am planning to resume it very soon.

But if I can work out on something during this span in order to get into the position where I can resume, would be glad to know!</p>
","<p>The best practice for climbing is to actually go climbing. I have wasted both time and money experimenting with training setups at home for practicing climbing, and I have mostly been disappointed. Since then I have transitioned my efforts at home to <strong>staying in shape for climbing</strong> (slightly different from what you are asking.) Unless you want to spend thousands of dollars, have a lot of spare time and are very dedicated to replicate something that is not really replicable, I would suggest (like DavidR mentioned in his comment,) you work on general fitness (with a focus on strengthening fingers and core), and possibly loose those few extra pounds that you are not that proud of anyways.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JAAcg.jpg"" alt=""Awesome Locking Carabiner""></p>

<p>I love this feature. Unfortunately, I already own dozens of carabiners without this wonderful red line.</p>

<p>(I would also like to be able to write a date on all my carabiners, so I know how old they are. So this would be doubly useful information.)</p>
","<p>The method by which carabiners in any color are coated (either gate or body) is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anodizing"" rel=""noreferrer"">anodizing</a>, which is going to be nearly impossible to sufficiently replicate with anything practical and cost-effective at home. With anodizing, the coating essentially becomes part of the aluminum itself. So anything you put on the gate will wear off relatively quickly and potentially cause the screw-gate to jam up. <strong>Nothing you paint on a carabiner or its gate will be permanent.</strong> Even the anodizing eventually wears off, unless of course you never use them.</p>

<p><strong>Don't use the ""metal markers"", aka paint pens.</strong> The coat of paint they apply would definitely be too thick for a carabiner gate, and while quite tough, it's also less durable than fingernail polish.</p>

<p>That said, fingernail polish, as others have mentioned, is worth a shot. Carefully put a very light, thin coat on only the gate itself and not any crevices or threads. Before you apply it, make sure you clean everything well so the polish adheres with a green Scotch-brite pad, or similar pad (not the non-scratch kind). Aluminum oxidizes over time and will prevent the fingernail polish from sticking, so if you don't clean it, the polish will flake/rub off rather quickly for sure.</p>

<p>Whatever you do, do a test on just one carabiner first to make sure that the marking has adhered and also that the gate still functions as intended.</p>

<p>For what it's worth, I've never known anyone that has painted/marked the gates of carabiners. Spines are usually where any markings or taping end up. So any community standard that exists would be for identification purposes, either to determine ownership or if a piece has been retired to non-critical purposes (doesn't need to keep you alive).</p>

<p><em>Here is an example of even hard anodizing wearing off. You can't see it so much in this photo, but the under/inner side is even more worn than the outside.</em>

<p>(And with any of these systems there is the finer question of which <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_ellipsoid#Historical_Earth_ellipsoids"">Earth ellipsoid</a> or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datum_%28geodesy%29"">datum</a> my map or GPS is based on, which could make a difference of a few tens or hundreds of meters in the position; in dense forest this could make it considerably harder for rescuers to find me.)</p>

<p>Obviously I want to avoid any confusion; if I give my position in (say) degrees / minutes / seconds, and a helicopter pilot blindly types it in their GPS which is set to decimal degrees, they'll go to the wrong place (perhaps many kilometers away).  UTM is less ambiguous, but will they even know what that is?  I may be speaking to a dispatcher in an urban office, perhaps over a noisy and unreliable phone or radio connection, and that's hardly the time for a technical discussion of the fine points of geodesy.</p>

<p>So in short:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Is there a particular position format that's preferred by emergency responders?</p></li>
<li><p>Are dispatchers and responders sufficiently trained to understand the difference between these positions, so that I can use any format if I tell them which one it is?</p></li>
<li><p>Are there other general ""best practices"" for this situation?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I suppose the answers may differ between different countries or regions (I'm in the US) or between land and sea emergencies (I'm usually on land).</p>
","<p>I would recommend UTM coordinates; it avoids the formatting uncertainty of lat/long and is better suited for ground operations.  (Easy to translate to paper maps, define search areas, and calculate distances.)  If you use the WGS84 datum, the numerical portions are also identical with the military grid reference system (MGRS) and the national grid (USNG).  In my area the local mountain rescue groups (BAMRU, Tahoe Nordic) use UTM.</p>

<p>That said, aircraft and ships at sea usually prefer latitude and longitude values as the numbers don't ""reset"" when you cross zones, and they are usually covering much greater distances than people on land.  Per the addendum I added at the end, the recommended format is degrees and decimal minutes.  The linked PDF suggests reading coordinates as in the following example (for 39° 36.06’N by 76° 51.42’W):
“Three nine degrees, three six decimal zero six minutes North by seven six degrees, five one decimal four two minutes West.”</p>

<p>Regardless of coordinate system, have the person on the other end repeat the numbers back to you; this is one set of numbers you don't want to have an error.  Writing down your message before communicating will also help you with a poor connection or low batteries as you'll avoiding wasting time trying to remember what else you need to communicate.</p>

<p>Finally, as others mentioned, the dispatcher should be able to handle any coordinate format, and any search teams will be using topo maps and translating the coordinates to their preferred format.  (They are usually familiar with the areas they regularly work in.)</p>

<p>Addendum: I suspected that [within the US] UTM was becoming a SAR standard, as a quick Google suggests that to be the case.  Further digging indicates the National Search and Rescue Committee has <a href=""http://www.uscg.mil/hq/cg5/cg534/nsarc/Land_SAR_Addendum/Published_Land%20SAR%20Addendum%20(1118111)%20-%20Bookmark.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">designated</a> the US National Grid (USNG) system as the standard coordinate system for land-based SAR in the United States, and latitude and longitude (in decimal minutes) for aircraft and boats.  This does not mean that some (many?) local agencies are no longer using their older preferred systems; full compliance is probably many years away. If you want to know more about USNG, I suggest posting a separate question, but here's a comparison:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>USNG: 18S UJ 23371 06519</p></li>
<li><p>MGRS: 18SUJ2337106519</p></li>
<li><p>UTM: 18 323371 4306519</p></li>
</ul>

<p>(Note that USNG and MGRS use a letter pair for the 100km grid squares whereas UTM doesn't; UTM instead has additional digits.  The Easting and Northing values always have the same precision: 3x3, 4x4, and so forth.  I personally prefer the USNG style.)</p>

<p>After cleaning it is a good time to sharpen it. If the hinges are still stiff, a drop of light oil (3 in 1 or bike chain oil) at each hinge should do the trick. Work the oil in by opening and closing all the blades a couple of times before assuming you didn't use enough, then wipe any excess off before putting it in your pocket. You  could wrap it in a tissue the first day you carry it in your pocket, in case oil escapes when warmed by body heat - I used to carry one when I wore a suit. </p>

"How can I tell which way is ""down wind""","3131","","<p>I'll be backpacking in areas where a bear canister is required by regulation.  All of the tip's I've read say to store it XYZ number of feet ""downwind from your camp"", presumably so the scent of the food moves away from you rather than in your direction.</p>

<p>I've never paid all that much attention to the wind, but in the north east (inland) it seems to blow all willy nilly.  This appears to be reinforced by the fact that the smoke from my fire is smarter than I am and doesn't care if I move my seating position, it will find my eyes in due time.</p>

<p>Likewise - if it isn't a noticeably blustery day how can you tell which way the air currents are generally moving?</p>
","<p><strong>Use your ears.</strong> OK, Let me explain that.</p>

<p>But first things first. The direction of the wind is what we call “downwind”. If I throw a handful of white flour into the wind, the direction that flour travels is “downwind”.</p>

<p>The breeze picks up the scent of nearly everything it touches and carries that scent along wherever it goes. Like the white flour, but on a scale so small that you can’t see it, the smell of nearly everything on your person and in your camp is picked up and carried on the wind. Any animal passing downwind from your camp then knows everything that is in your camp, just by smell (if its sniffer is sensitive enough – and a bear’s is). </p>

<p>So, you are exactly right. Store your food at least 100 feet downwind from your camp. If a bear is attracted to your camp, he will most likely be tempted by your food, so keeping it far from you will help keep you safe. Hopefully, the canister will do its job and keep your food safe.</p>

<p>Generally, the wind blows different directions throughout the day, because of terrain and changes in temperature. At night, temperatures even out and cool and air movements usually settle down, becoming slow and steady (no hot, moving sun in the sky to heat up the air). Therefore, if you don’t know the prevailing night-time wind directions in your area, <strong>it would be best</strong> to check the direction of air movement after the sun goes down (assuming there are no storms stirring things up).</p>

<p>As air cools, it sinks, flowing downhill. If you are backpacking in hilly or mountainous areas, rest assured that the breeze will be blowing downhill during the night (unless there is a storm). If one is near the ocean (I know, you stated that you are inland), then the wind should blow out to sea when the sun is down (I live far, far inland, so I have not experienced this, but that’s what I was taught in school).</p>

<p>Here is the <strong>best</strong> way that I have found to discover the direction of the breeze near my camp (Using my ears):</p>

<p>Wait until dusk, that calming, shadowy time between sundown and full dark. Walk in a wide circle around your camp (20-30 feet out will do), stopping several times to test the direction of the air currents. To test the direction of the air currents, simply uncover your head, face and neck, and turn slowly. The fine hairs on your cheeks, and especially your ears, can feel the breeze (even a very soft breeze). When you feel the breeze blowing across the fine hairs on your cheeks and both ears, stop. You are facing UPwind. DOWNwind is directly behind you. Sampling the wind like this in a circle around your camp helps you make a very confident assessment of the wind’s direction. If the breeze is gentle and erratic, you may have to make a couple circles, and even then, you may have to guess a little. However, it’s ok if you don’t get it exactly right, as long as you place/hang your food far from camp. The goal is to place your food in such a way that it does not lure a bear into your camp.</p>

"Are Ice grips worth buying?","3112","","<p>The cold weather has finally hit the UK and once again I am tempted to buy something like <a href=""https://www.yaktrax.co.uk/shop/yaktrax-pro"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Yaktrax Pro Ice Grips</a>.  For those of you not in the UK we get some snow each year (enough to make everything grind to a halt), but as the temperature is usually around 0oC it often melts and refreezes into ice causing very slippery pavements.  I've got a decent pair of walking boots and they are much better than trainers, but they fail when confronted with sheet ice.</p>

<p>So my question is are these Ice grip things as in the link (a similar idea to crampons but less without the specific requirements for types of footwear) worth buying, do they significantly improve grip and are there any pit-falls I should be aware of?</p>
","<p>I have used both the Pro version of YakTrax as well as the normal version that lacks the velcro strap across the forefoot.</p>

<p>They are amazingly well engineered, durable and perform as advertised. On ice, hard snow and frozen trails, they provide excellent footing. Of course - if you are walking on a dry smooth surface like marble or stone, the grip isn't as good as you would have with a completely rubber sole, but the foot feel is good and I would highly recommend them for hiking and trail running as well as general cold weather traction.</p>

<p>I have had the pro versions for 5 seasons and they show no signs of wear after easily a hundred miles under foot - half of this mountain hiking in Montana. My normal pair see more on/off for short use like dog walking and this pair are several seasons old. I live in Minnesota, so both get months of use at a time.</p>

<p>Who decides how the route will go and where to place the bolts? How could they know before the thing has been climbed whether they're putting them in good places, route-wise? The whole thing seems very confusing to me.</p>
","<p>What you're talking about is Sport climbing. </p>

<p>Generally these bolts are placed by the person who is creating the climb. They will normally top rope or abseil the climb and work out where they want it to go, then spend a couple of days placing the bolts, while on a top rope. They are drilled and glued into place and this can take a lot of time.</p>

<p>Sometimes the person who places these will do the first ascent, sometimes not, this will often depend on the grade.  Some test pieces are made deliberately very hard as a type of challenge to other climbers.</p>

<p>Learning where to put the bolts is a skill unto itself and is more Art than science.</p>

"How to ""spot"" someone who is bouldering?","3078","","<p>We have discussed a lot and at length about how to climb and other climbing techniques. I haven't come across a single post that talks about Spotting techniques. </p>

<p>What are the duties of a Spotter? What is the best a spotter can do to ensure that the fall of a climber results in minimum or no injury?</p>
","<p>Basically, ""spotting"" someone means making sure that they safely land on the pad with their feet first to prevent injuries in case of a fall.</p>

<p>This means several distinct tasks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Moving a falling climber to the pad: try to guide them towards the pad, ideally by pushing at the hips or shoulders. Don't try to catch them (which includes not standing directly beneath them)! You won't be able to do that, and might hurt yourself. However, you can try to slow the fall a bit. While doing that, keep your fingers together, and your thumb next to the index finger (not opposed). </li>
<li>Keeping them upright: Especially in very overhanging routes, prefer to keep your hands under their shoulders so that they land on their feet. Landing on your back really hurts, but is easily prevented that way.</li>
<li>Prevent them from falling over while landing: make sure that they don't tumble backwards and off the pad. That can still hurt quite a bit, especially after long falls!</li>
<li>Moving the pad (not applicable in most indoor gyms): if necessary, adjust the position of the pad if the climber moves to a position where they would not hit it when falling. This is easier with multiple spotters; otherwise, you should only do that when the climber is in a somewhat safe position. Smaller pushes with your feet are preferable to picking up the pad with your hands.</li>
</ul>

<p>As in many other climbing situations, communication is key; e.g. most of the climbers that I know really appreciate it if you tell them before you move the pad (so they can take a safe position), or assure them that you are really paying attention while they are at a hard move.</p>

"Do mountains regularly (for a mountain) change height?","3073","","<p>a little related to this question:</p>

<p><a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/6907/how-many-munro-revisions-have-there-been"">How many &quot;Munro&quot; revisions has there been?</a></p>

<p>Leads me to wonder do mountains change height? or is this because the equipment is more precise these days?</p>

<p>I understand that erosion will (very gradually) lower a mountain. I suppose I mean geologically and I suppose specifically in <strong>relatively un-active areas</strong> such as the Cairngorms/Scotland.</p>

<p>If they do change height by how much? (roughly)</p>
","<p>While heights do change slowly by natural processes such changes are likely to be on the order of centimeters barring any extreme events.</p>

<p>Most changes in published heights of hills since people started measuring these things accurately (only the last couple of hundred years) are due to improvements/investments in technology.</p>

<p>Measuring the height of a hill is surprisingly hard. One of the earliest ways to determine hill height was <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometry"">trigonometry</a>. If you have two points with a known distance between them and one known height (sea-level works well here) then by careful measurement of angles you can determine the height (and distance) of a third point. The accuracy here will depend on the the ability to measure an accurate angle and the distance to the third point. I haven't done any accurate calculation but with tools of the late 19th/early 20th c. I reckon accuracy of a few meters is reasonable. Possibly a bit higher with careful repeated measurements.</p>

<p>Interestingly this is what lead to the introduction of the system of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulation_station"">trig points</a> in the UK and other places. Which used this principle to map out distances and heights across the country.</p>

<p>Even in modern times calculating heights is not trivial. <a href=""http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/blog/2011/08/how-do-you-measure-a-mountain/"">Here</a> is an interesting article but the ordnance survey describing the process.</p>

<p>Primarily, they use photogrammetry (and probably related techniques such as LIDAR) to measure height by air. This is a quick way to cover large areas by is limited to accuracy of a couple of meters.</p>

<p>If you want to measure height accurately you need to leave a fixed GPS receiver in place for several weeks. While the accuracy here can be a few centimeters it is too expensive to be used in most situations.</p>

<p>Therefore there is significant uncertainty about some Munros height considering how close they are to the 3000' (914m) cut-off. The two post 1997 Munro re-classifications have both been due to interested parties hiring an team of surveyors to do very accurate measurements of some mountains which are more accurate than what the OS would normally do and they found that these two are just below the cut-off.</p>

<p>So with these requirements locked down, the only thing I can think of is some sort of bow or crossbow, but these are pretty cumbersome(the latter more than the former) and I might be in a blind spot here.</p>

<p>What tools besides a crossbow or a bow would fill these requirements?</p>
","<p>It requires a fair amount of skill to be highly accurate with (more than I ever developed anyway) but the elastic-band slingshot meets these requirements.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Flat-band (as opposed to tubular) slingshots in particular can achieve a high velocity making them effective in both external and terminal ballistics.</p></li>
<li><p>There are few tools lighter than a standard wooden Y slingshot.</p></li>
<li><p>Lead shot is best but even pebbles would be effective on small game, especially at close range.  (Lead has the advantage of carrying more energy farther.)</p></li>
<li><p>A slingshot can be easily carried or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5h0sGu5POY"" rel=""nofollow"">worn</a> due to the compact size and light weight, and requires little preparation before a shot.</p></li>

"Effective way to carry a sleeping mattress with rucksack?","3039","","<blockquote>
  <p>I am going for four day hike in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Ghats"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Western Ghats</a>. The terrain is
  rocky humid and It is one of the eight ""hottest hotspots"" of
  biological diversity in the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am trying to pack my rucksack as per the terrain and found that sleeping mattress is a most important thing while hiking in this type of terrain.</p>

<p>I am using <a href=""https://www.decathlon.co.uk/m200-camping-sleeping-mat-id_5587547.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">QUECHUA M200 CAMPING SLEEPING MAT</a>.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/B0VVD.jpg"" height=""300""></p>

<p>This is my first time using sleeping mattress in a hike. I am confused how to carry a mattress with rucksack.</p>

<p>I found some possible ways of carrying sleeping mattresses with rucksack.
like following.</p>

<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rrCND.jpg"" height=""200""></p>

<p>I think it is best to avoid attaching anything to the outside of a rucksack; items attached to the outside are more likely to get wet, damaged or lost.  You must also be careful not to overbalance your bag as this will cause unnecessary back strain.</p>

<p><strong>What is the best effective way to carry a sleeping mattress?</strong></p>
","<p>I think having it vertically using side compression straps or bungees on the rear of the bag effects movement the least (ie not getting caught on stuff). As Kate Gregory mentions the pads are really light and don't affect the balance of the bag too much so I wouldn't worry about that. foam pads like the one you have are also really tough! Unlike an inflatable it doesn't really matter if it gets a hole or tear.</p>

<p><img src=""https://cdn.ukc2.com/i/245410.jpg"" alt=""frendo spur""></p>

<p><em>image chosen mostly for dramatic clouds</em></p>

<p>Another alternative is to chop your sleeping-mat up into panels that fit against the back of your bag and create hinges using gaffer tape. many people use this to replace existing back supports in bags so the pad will serve two purposes. The down side is you are unlikely to get the whole mat in and retain a usable volume for your other gear so will have to decide between a long very thin mat that covers the whole body or a shorter wider mat that just covers the torso (put your legs on your bag)</p>

<p>The decision is normally determined by the trip you are making. How much extra stuff do you need to put in the bag? How likely will a mat on the outside of your bag get caught on things. What do you consider to be uncomfortable? </p>

<p>A slight aside is that its worth having one back panel of foam in your bag at all times even if you have no intention of camping out. Its great for sitting on when you stop to rest or eat and can prove extremely important for insulation if someone is injured and may need to remain immobile for a long period of time while you sort-out help.</p>

"Is it a good Idea to drink grape sap if you have no clean water?","3037","","<p>In spring, the grape vines are so full of watery sap that a cut from my pocket knife causes it to trickle out fairly fast, and it can be collected in a container. Someone told me that it is a good substitute for water on a trip, because it is purified by the plant. Is this true? </p>
","<p>I'll give this a stab, but there aren't any authoritative sources that I've managed to find on the subject!</p>

<p>The most I could really find are examples such as <a href=""http://www.scienceforums.net/topic/37107-i-drank-some-grape-sap/"">this</a> one where people have drank it and felt no ill effects, and I haven't found a documented case of anyone drinking it and it being harmful to them. From a biological point of view the vine will at least partly purify the ground water, though if it's a known heavily contaminated area I wouldn't take it as a substitute for a proper water filter.</p>

<p>In terms of the effect on the grape vine, most sources I've found seem to show that while it seems alarming it's actually <em>not</em> that bad for the vine, though obviously if you make cuts everywhere and drain all the sap there will come a point where it won't be able to sensibly recover.</p>

<p>In short, if you're really desperate for water and it's the only source available in a survival situation, I'd see no great reason for not giving it a try. It isn't however a direct substitute for a good, purified water source.</p>

"Why are backpack waist straps so long?","3036","","<p>I was hiking with some friends and we concluded that most/all our bags have ridiculously long waist straps that leave lots of extra strap that is annoying or must be tidied away. Additionally, some of us have to have the strap as tight as it will go to make it vaguely tight. Given that many hikers are fairly slight, this seems quite bad design.</p>

<p>Is there a sensible reason why its like this?</p>
","<p>Some reasons for the long waist straps are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The most backpacks have only <strong>one size for everyone</strong>, so the backpack must fit a short/ tall/ tiny/ big person. </li>
<li>It also depends what your wear for <strong>clothes <em>under</em> your rucksack</strong>, if you wear it over a single shirt or over a big insulation-jacket. </li>
<li><em>For alpine backpacks or traveling</em>: the waist straps need to <strong>fit around the backpack</strong> so you can clip them out of the way so they're not over your harness while climbing, or so they don't get caught on handrails, etc... while using public transport.</li>
<li>If you <strong>wear gloves</strong>, it's also handy to have the straps a bit longer than without gloves.</li>
</ul>

<p>For some styles of backpacks you can find different sizes, these sizes include the length as well as the width of a person, which will offer a better fit. </p>

"Safe to use Old Water Filter?","3034","","<p>I have a PUR Hiker Microfilter and a Katadyn Water Microfilter sitting in my closet that I only use once in a great while (I don't go on overnight backpacking trips very often).</p>

<p>Whenever I do plan on a trip, I'm always hesitant to trust these filters are still in good condition to use. Don't they develop mold or other contaminants when left idle for years? I'm talking like 5 or so years without use...</p>

<p><strong>Is there a way to clean these so I can be sure they are safe to use, or does the microfilter cartridge have a certain shelf-life and is then no longer safe to use?</strong></p>
","<p>As I understand the technology, your microfilters will not expire on the shelf if maintained and stored properly. Their lifetime is determined by the number of gallons pumped.</p>

<p>What can happen is if you don't properly dry out your filter before storing then it will develop mold. In that situation you can decide if it is best to clean the filter or replace it. For cleaning instructions I copied the following from <a href=""http://www.katadyn.com/usen/technical-support/filter-support/faq/"">Katadyn's Q&amp;A page</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is very important that the ceramic element be completely dry before it is stored for an extended time period. It is recommended to dry the element for up to 3 days before putting it back in the filter. If the filter has been stored damp and has a foul odor, we recommend the following: Pump 1-2 liters of water, combined with a small amount of Micropur Forte or baking soda, through the filter; then soak the ceramic element in the combination over night. Rinse it out and pump several liters of clean water through the system. For a taste test, use natural, non-chlorinated, water.</p>

"How dangerous is it to fall 3 meters when lead climbing?","3026","","<p>Consider a vertical rock with clip-ins 3 meters apart, dynamic rope, no more than 15 meters ascent.</p>

<p>I guess most probable and dangerous is to fall just as one is clipping in. This way the rope is overextended, plus one i holding with only one hand.</p>

<p>How dangerous is it for a for a <strong>beginner climber</strong> to fall? What protection equipment should be used. What training exercises should be completed beforehand?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>How dangerous is it to fall 3 meters when lead climbing?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This depends a lot on the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_factor"">fall factor</a>. Counterintuitively, the fall factor is higher, indicating a more dangerous fall, when you are near the beginning of a pitch. This is because there's less rope out, so there's less stretchiness.</p>

<p>As Steed's comment points out, you're going to fall more than 6 m in this situation, not 3 m. After you get your first clip in, you may have a false sense of security; by the time you're reaching for the second clip (which is 6 m up in the situation you've described), you have enough rope out so that if you miss the clip and fall, you're going to hit the deck.</p>

<p>Different falls can have different run-outs. A fall from an overhang is actually the safest, since you can't hit anything. Depending on the route, you could swing like a pendulum, or slide down a slab and get cheese-grater injuries.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What protection equipment should be used.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A helmet. If you're trad climbing, that's a whole different thing -- we'd be talking about a trad rack.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What training exercises should be completed beforehand?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Start by learning to give a lead belay, and practice doing that enough times so that you understand the whole process well. Learn by watching your climber while belaying. Discuss things verbally with your climber. Help your climber catch mistakes.</p>

<p>Learn not to back-clip, z-clip, put your thumb through the biner, or back-step the rope. Spend some time at home practicing clipping efficiently in a variety of positions with a quickdraw hanging on a doorknob.</p>

<p>If you do fall, absorb the impact against the wall with your legs, and don't grab the rope.</p>

<p>Learn the steps involved when you get to the top of a sport climb. This is actually pretty complicated.</p>

<p>There are some advantages to learning to lead in a gym. For example, the routes tend to be constructed so that the run-outs are very safe, there is no danger from rock-fall, and you don't have to worry about the quality of your anchors.</p>

"What mosquito nets can be used while camping?","3026","","<p>When camping in areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic, what options are there in terms of mosquito nets? The mosquito nets I've seen are meant to be hung above a bed and tucked under the mattress, but would any make sense to use in a tent? If not, what are some options for mosquito (or other insect) protection while sleeping?</p>
","<p>There are several types and configurations of mosquito nets that you can use:</p>

<ul>
<li>ones that hang (from a single center point, or from four corners), </li>
<li>ones that drape over your bag with one or two poles that go over your head to keep it off your face, </li>
<li>full free-standing</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on your situation, each has its advantages and disadvantages. </p>

<p><strong>Choosing a net:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Areas with rampant mosquito-born diseases are likely <em>hot</em> as well, meaning you won't want a sleeping bag, so the ""draping"" type nets won't do much good</li>
<li>A net that is <em>too short</em> will leave your feet or forehead pressed against the wall, inviting bites.</li>
<li><em>Tucking</em> the mosquito net under your bag, sleeping mat, mattress, etc is essential not just for mosquitoes, but for other creepy-crawlies.</li>
<li>Free-standing bug nets shaped like a small 1 or 2 person tent you can pitch (inside a larger tent, or inside a hut for example) provide the most convenient and versatile option and tend to be easier to seal off.</li>
<li>Remember that mosquitoes are not the only pests. The biggest annoyances are often the ""no-see-ums,"" which although don't carry illness, can make for a miserable nights. Choose a net with the <em>smallest gap between the weave</em> as possible.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Chemicals:</strong></p>

<p><em>Permethrine:</em> After 2 years of living in the tropical rain forest, and suffering the tenacity of mosquitoes and no-see-ums which manage to find their way through any tiny imperfection in the net, I just started treating my nets with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permethrin""><em>Permethrine</em></a> </p>

<p>This stuff is highly toxic to fish, and insects, so care should be used when applying it - however I have found it to be highly effective in keeping mosquitoes and no-see-ums away from the net so they don't ever find those imperfections.</p>

<p><em>DEET:</em> Although highly effective as a repellent, prolonged exposure, to high quantities especially in hot sweaty environments, has been linked in some toxicological reports to some ailments. Regardless, I don't much care for doping up before I sleep - so tend to avoid it, though spraying clothes can be a good added measure of protection.</p>

<p><em>Mosquito Coils:</em> I am not sure the chemical agent involved, or the safety of prolongued inhalation of the smoke, but mosquito coils burnt around the sleeping area reduces the number of insects visiting.</p>

<p><em>Citronella:</em> Some people swear by citronella and lemongrass, either as an oil applied to the skin for short-term reduction, or a candle that provides a smoke repellent.</p>

<p><em>Eucalyptus Oil:</em> Provides a short term repellent, and can provide some relief for itching from those bites that already snuck through.</p>

<p>As a final precaution, setting a (controlled) smoky fire burning in the corner of your hut, or tarp will help reduce the number of mosquitoes hanging around throughout the night. </p>

"How to tell the time at night","3013","","<p>What is the simplest way to approximate time after the sun has set? Perhaps using the moon's height and phase? This would make the most sense to me, but what could you do in the case of a new moon?</p>
","<p>Another way to find the time is to use well known stars.  In the northern hemisphere, you can use the Pole Star and the Big Dipper to tell the time fairly accurately.  A good explanation of the procedure can be found <a href=""http://www.johnpratt.com/items/astronomy/telltime.html"">here</a>.  Here is a abbreviated quote from that site :</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Find the Big Dipper in the Northern sky. Imagine one big hour-hand on a clock, which is centered on the north star (to which the two pointer stars ""point."" Read the time to the nearest quarter hour as if it were a normal clock.</li>
  <li><p>Add one hour for every month after March 7. Do this to the nearest quarter month. The star clock will read 12:00 at midnight on March 7, so memorize March 7, no matter where you are. If today is April 9, then it is about 1 month after March 7, so add 1 hour.</p></li>
  <li><p>Double the time (because it is really a 24-hour clock).</p></li>
  <li><p>Subtract from 24 (or 48 if necessary). We subtract because the clock is going backwards, that is, counterclockwise.</p></li>
  <li><p>Correct for Zone Time, because you've already memorized that when the sun says noon that we call it (for example) 1:30 during daylight savings.</p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The website also gives an example, so you can work trough it too make sure you understand all the steps.  You do need to remember of few things, but once you get the hang of it should be pretty straightforward.</p>

"Which mid-line knot is best suited for a trucker's hitch?","3011","","<p>I've been using a trucker's hitch knot for a very long time (camping, strapping stuff down, line length adjustment, pulley system)
I've always switched my mid-line loop when I've come to not trust them for numerous reasons (not secure, impossible to untie after loaded, rope damage, take too long, etc...).</p>

<p>Here is an example <a href=""http://www.animatedknots.com/truckers/"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.animatedknots.com/truckers/</a><br>
This one is tied using a directional fig 8 as the mid-line knot.</p>

<p>I've used the following knots for periods of time, switching between them as I feel uncertain:</p>

<ul>
<li>slip knot (quick, not reliable)</li>
<li>alpine butterfly (quick, reliable, seizes up)</li>
<li>directional figure 8 (quick, reliable, seizes up)</li>
<li>sliding prusik (doesn't seize,  not quick if not already on rope,
sometimes not reliable)</li>
<li>bowline on a bight (reliable, doesn't seize, not quick)</li>
<li>span loop  (reliable, quick, seizes up)</li>
<li>""half"" sheep shank with a half hitch to secure also called a bell
ringer's knot (quick, doesn't seize, reliable?)</li>
</ul>

<p>They all have their uses and advantages but I'm looking for that 'bomb proof' setup where I can load it to the max that the rope can handle and still be able to hold while not making this mid-line knot impossible to remove and doesn't permanently damage the rope. Speed is important as well because I will often pull out my cordage and tie down a trailer full of stuff while my Father/Father In Law will be fiddling with straps that have a tendency to become a nightmare of a mess.</p>

<p>My go to was a directional figure 8 for the longest time but it started to get very difficult to untie when using heavy loads (I'm heavy and like to use hammocks while camping :) some of my cordage has these in there permanently). I then switched to using the span loop for a long time but that also locks up. I've now settled on a bell ringer's with a half hitch lock.</p>

<p>This has worked well for me when tied properly but it 'feels' like it is not secure. I've never had it fail (even on 6 hours trips being used to tied down kitchen appliances on a trailer) but it just doesn't seem like a very stable setup. </p>

<p>What knot is best suited as the 'fixed' knot in a trucker's hitch?</p>
","<p>The way I've always done it is with a 'slippery half-hitch.'  It's quick, I don't believe it can spill and it is always reasonable to untie once the load is removed.</p>

<p>It took me a while to find an illustration, but <a href=""http://fliesbydon.freeservers.com/Images/Knots/truckers_hitch.gif"" rel=""noreferrer"">this</a> is a fine one. </p>

<p>Edit: In response to your issue with removing the slipknot, I was playing with some paracord and I believe something like this will resist cinching and be easy to remove, even after being loaded.  I made it by taking several turns round the standing part before creating the slipknot's loop.  Then use that loop (left uncinched) to take the load after going around your tie-down point.</p>

","<p>The answer is very dependent on the prevailing weather conditions where you are active, and what your budget is</p>

<h2>Synthetic</h2>

<p>Advantages:</p>

<ol>
<li>Lower overall price. </li>
<li>Maintains thermal properties when wet.</li>
<li>Does not reduce loft in high-humidity/ sweaty sleeping conditions.</li>
<li>Easier to clean.</li>

<li>Does not compress as small as down.</li>
<li>Higher weight to loft ratio. (Compared to 650+ down fill)</li>
<li>Retains smells more than down.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Down</h2>

<p>Advantages:</p>

<ol>
<li>Very warm for the weight.</li>
<li>Long life of product. </li>
<li>Compressibility.</li>
<li>Distribution of insulation is near equal over the bag surface.</li>

<li>Price is higher than synthetic (50-100% for same temperature rating)</li>
<li>Cleaning and maintenance. (Special soap, washing, and drying)</li>
<li>When wet the loft is practically useless.</li>
<li>Absorbs some moisture from the body during sleep.</li>

I found <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/40/how-do-i-wash-gore-tex-clothing/58#58"">this</a> but there seems to be conflicting views on certain aspects of the question.</p>

<p>What I would like to know is how should I go about washing my waterproof coat? It's not GoreTex, but IsoTex (5000 on the waterproof scale). This will be the first time I have washed it, and I've had it about a year now.
From reading other answers I assume I will need some sort of waterproofing agent to wash it with - are there different types for different materials and could anyone recommend a brand in the UK?</p>

<p>I'm also unsure about whether to tumble dry the coat or let it hang. I've seen comments claiming the tumble dryer will ruin the coat, and others saying it helps to reinforce the chemical outer layer. Can anyone confirm what the best method of drying the coat would be?</p>

<p>Lastly, I've seen plenty of waterproofing sprays in hiking shops before - are these any good/appropriate for use on a coat? Or are they just for re-applying lost waterproofing?</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>
","<p>As stated, your first port of call should be <a href=""https://www.regatta.com/garment-care/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the manufacturer's washing instructions</a></p>

<p>I'm not familiar with this fabric. A quick google of IsoTex basically shows it's <a href=""https://www.regatta.com/fabrics/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Regatta waterproof fabric</a>. Not much details on how it's made, etc. but it does state it has a Durable Water Repellent (DWR):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The DwR outer fabric reinforces the waterproof quality and helps the
  water to run off whilst adding to the garment's windproof performance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it's got a Hydrostatic Head of 5000 then it's not as waterproof as Gore-Tex. This, and looking at the types of coat its made into, and the price point for, etc. makes me think it's not got got a physical barrier like Gore-Tex (or if it does, it's not as sophisticated).</p>

<p>Bearing all the above in mind, you want a non-detergent cleaner. I always use <a href=""http://www.nikwax.com/en-gb/products/productdetail.php?productid=4"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NikWax Tech Wash</a>. Regatta recommend their own brand, but well they would... I've always had good results with the NikWax one though. Don't use normal washing powder; that will reduce the effectiveness of the DWR.</p>

<p>I would definitely then apply a new DWR. From looking at similar fabrics and reading reviews, a good application of DWR is pretty essential to this coat; without it, it isn't going to stay waterproof for long. </p>

<p>I prefer a spray-on one as opposed to a wash-in one. It allows you to be more targeted in its application, i.e. only spray it on the outside where it's supposed to go. </p>

<p>Tumble drying will improve the DWR. DWR works by tiny microscopic spikes keeping the water from soaking in. Over time these spikes wear down. Tumble drying (heating) allows the chemicals to re-form these spikes. <strong>Will it ruin your coat?</strong> What does the label say? If it says do not tumble dry, then don't. If it says you can, it will help and is worth doing.</p>

"How can one find the difficult to find geocaches?","2993","","<p>I've recently been getting into the hobby of Geocaching. However, I'm finding there are many, particularly in cities, that I just cannot find no matter how hard I look for them. They tend to be very small, and often have camouflage of some kind. What tips can you offer to help me improve my rate of finding them?</p>
","<p><strong>Read the cache page closely.</strong> There may be hints in other places as well as the obvious encrypted hint - the cache description, title, and previous logs may all pose clues that would help you on your search. I tend to try without first but if I'm really stuck I'll read all I can to try and give me a bit more of an idea.</p>

<p><strong>Bear in mind that the co-ordinates are often only rough.</strong> I've found a couple of caches where the co-ordinates have been 60m off! Bear in mind that you'll have the inaccuracy of the original person who grabbed the co-ordinates as well as the same of your own GPS, so in places with poor coverage it could be wildly out. If the place your GPS guides you to doesn't make sense, don't necessarily stick to that one spot, walk around, but...</p>

<p><strong>Don't scout randomly, use a methodical route.</strong> All too often people make the mistakes of walking around randomly and coming back to the same couple of places, missing the more subtle place that they would have found otherwise... I tend to check the obvious places first and then cover the area more thoroughly.</p>

<p><strong>Look up.</strong> People often look down and all around them for clues, but I've seen people really struggle to find caches in plain sight if they're above head height! Equally, look up for clues as well - I hid a cache with the clue ""underneath 3 cables"" (those cables being cables in plain sight running about 20 foot in the air) and you'd be surprised how many people looked for ages because they didn't get the clue!</p>

<p><strong>Bounce ideas off someone else.</strong> If you don't understand the clue, ask someone else if they have any ideas. Sometimes something you've been pondering over for hours can jump out near instantly to someone else! One particular clue was ""CND"", and the cache site was a few fence posts roughly in the shape of the corresponding flag. Being too young, I had no idea what ""CND"" meant at all - my parents were right on it however!</p>

<p><strong>Remember that caches can be all sorts of objects.</strong> They're not always just the obvious tin - I easily found one recently that was a (toy) frog, and many people had missed it on the assumption that just couldn't be it.</p>

<p><strong>Know when to give up.</strong> Seriously, if you can't find it having searched around for a couple of hours and the previous 6 logs were all DNFs (did not find), there's a very good chance it's no longer there. Leave a note and ask the cache owner to have a look if they aren't already.</p>

<p><em>Remember to mark a waypoint for your car</em>. Not strictly to do with finding them, but especially if it's a cache that involves wandering around and you're not exactly sure where you are, mark a waypoint for where you started / parked / know where you are. Takes all of 2 seconds and could save you wandering around lost for hours.</p>

<p>Overall though the best way to find them is practice - the more you end up finding the better you'll get at it and the more spots you'll notice that you wouldn't have otherwise. When I first started I was spending a long time finding most of them, now it's usually pretty quick!</p>

"Is it safe to sleep for more than 16 hrs a day at altitudes above 6000m?","2985","","<p>I am planning for a trek at the Advance Base Camp or if possible up to Camp II of Saser Kangri. The region is so deserted of people and expeditionists/mountaineers that there are usually only two to three odd tents at the Base Camp of the mountain, and it's a known fact that once you are beyond the Base Camp, yours is the only team at campsites en-route the summit.</p>

<p>The weather is very harsh, and the mountain does not allow much area to take a walk on a day when you are not going up the mountain. All you have is a deserted campsite and solace to enjoy. And this goes on for days, worst case for a week. In such cases, you are stuck at higher camps with absolutely no way to roam around or move up the mountain. All you can do is to hope and wait for the weather to get suitable for further progress.</p>

<p>I don't like to read for hours or sit around idle. I usually tend to doze off when I am not doing anything.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In such a case if I sleep for more than 16 hours a day, does that put me in a trouble by any means?</p></li>
<li><p>What are your tricks to stay up?</p></li>
</ul>
","<p>Anecdotally, the only three factors which may cause you problems are:</p>

<ul>
<li>supplies running out</li>
<li>losing fitness</li>
<li>boredom</li>
</ul>

<p>And these are really only an issue if you are stuck for extended periods of time. Your solutions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>exercises you can do in your tent, or just outside - stretches, press-ups, sit-ups, basic cardio - will help you maintain a level of fitness while potentially recovering from any stresses encountered in getting to camp</li>
<li>planning your supplies to take account of enforced downtime, and being prepared to contact emergency services of some kind before it's too late</li>
<li>you could try writing, rather than reading. A wild and isolated environment can provide a good muse </li>
<li>depending on your circumstances, you could take a small musical instrument (this <strong>will</strong> annoy fellow travellers after a while...) or a hand- or solar-powered radio.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Update</strong> - to answer the specific point about sleeping:</p>

<p>Sleep itself is not a problem, however if you are on your own, you should take certain precautions - eg if snow is heavy, an alarm set every hour so you can check you aren't getting buried or having your oxygen cut off is a good idea</p>

"Selecting backpacking cooking pot – teflon, aluminum, steel, titanium, or cast iron?","2979","","<p>What are the relative advantages / dangers of different cooking wear? I'm a one-pot gourmet that has been using the same stainless steel pot for 15 years, but am considering an upgrade.</p>

<p>Some things I have heard but not substantiated: teflon flakes off and you might ingest it. Aluminum can leech into acidic foods. Titanium shatters in cold? Cast iron makes the best flap-jacks...</p>
","<p>The absolute best is going to be titanium, but it also happens to be the most expensive. I'm not sure where you heard that it shatters in the cold, but being a space age metal I would think it can handle cold earth temperatures just fine.</p>

<p>If you can't shell out the cash for titanium it's more or less a toss up between aluminum and stainless steel. Technically aluminum leeches, but so slowly that for just your backpacking gear it's not a problem. Stainless steel doesn't leech but also doesn't distribute heat as well, so you need to be sure to stir your food more, but that's not a big downside in my book. I use stainless steel myself.</p>

<p>One other recommendation I need to make is, no matter what the material, find a pot with a tight-fitting lid. Getting water to a boil with a tight-fitting lid is MUCH quicker and saves you fuel.</p>

<p>As for cast iron, it gives your food the best flavor but is extremely heavy. Use it for camping trips but not backpacking.</p>

"How should I traverse fields with horses in?","2968","","<p>I am surprised at how many people I see doing this wrongly (my experience being an ex-horse owner and now hiker in the UK).</p>

<p>What is the correct way to traverse a field containing horses?</p>

<p>Let's exclude the different trespass laws and property defence laws in different countries - here in the UK we do have rights of way that cross fields with horses and livestock: my question is focused on the safety and welfare of the horse and the person traversing the field.</p>
","<p>Often in British countryside you'll find fields with horses in (and cows and much of this is applicable to bovine) where it is <strong>unavoidable or rather difficult</strong> to go a different way and the are a few things to be aware of. Usually you'll be heading over something similar to this: </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fvEgN.jpg"" alt=""Credit to geograph.org.uk""></p>

<p>As public rights of way here allow footpaths through any field, garden, park, etc etc. I've walked through many a front or back garden whilst people are sitting out in summer (Kinda awkward!) but it's how footpaths work here.</p>

<p>Firstly if you do come across a field with horses in, before entering the field take a good look around you, if the horses are far away, then enter the field and keep yourself, any children, or dogs close to you, with dogs on a lead (though child leads are not uncommon for toddlers!). Walk around the edge of the field to the other exit. Try and keep children and animals quiet too.</p>

<p>Pretty simple if that's the case, but not always will it be so.</p>

<p>If the horses are scattered, stick to your chosen path around the field. Don't think to cut across unless you feel confident and it's not a large field.</p>

<p>If it's muddy, which is common, try not to make a lot of fuss, I've seen horses spook at their own shadows.</p>

<p>If the horses are close to the gates, never fear. Actually that's a valid point and not a saying. Don't act skittish, keep your head up, don't make eye contact and sensibly navigate the horses keeping to the front, a bite is better than a kick.</p>

<p>Always avoid approaching the horses where possible, and definitely don't bother feeding them (most likely they're going to be on strict diets and an apple from every stranger won't help!).</p>

<p>If you're cycling through horse fields the above is all completely applicable, but the best advice I can add is to dismount and walk around calmly.</p>

<p><strong>Also</strong> bear in mind that in the UK people can possibly be riding in these fields, I used to gallop down the fields in summer and often had to deal with people who did not look around before rushing out into our fields.</p>

"Using the Yosemite Decimal System, how difficult is Everest?","2958","","<p>I've often heard that it is the altitude and exposure that makes Everest most challenging, but technically speaking, it's not a very challenging climb at all.

","<p>This <a href=""http://www.outsideonline.com/blog/outdoor-adventure/is-an-everest-climb-technical.html"">post</a> provides a YDS rating for various sections of the Everest climb. Recall that the YDS rating system begins at class 1 for easy trail walking, class 4 is like climbing a ladder, and technical climbing begins at class 5. </p>

<p>Overall, it seems like the climb up Everest is not very technical--it's mainly the altitude and weather that make it so difficult. Here are some sections taken from the article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The trek to Everest Base Camp is mostly class 1 intermixed with brief class 2 sections.</p>
  
  <p>Some of the route from Camp 2 at the base of theLhotse Face to the South Summit is class 3 but mostly class 2 via the fixed ropes.</p>
  
  <p>I would rate the Khumbu Icefall overall as class 4 due to the crevasse danger and the need to use hands and feet on ladders and climbing over ice formations. However, a large part of the Icefall is on somewhat smooth terrain which would be rated class 2, however at 19,000'.</p>
  
  <p>With the route fixed, almost none of the South Col route meets these definitions [of class 5] even though an axe and crampons are used. However, obviously, there are much more difficult routes on Everest that significantly exceed the South Col and Northeast Ridge difficulty</p>

"Hiking and climbing in smoky areas","2939","","<p>This Fall, there are a lot of large fires burning in the pacific northwest of the US and the air quality on many trails and mountains is poor as a result.  This makes hiking and climbing unpleasant, unhealthy and possibly unsafe.  </p>

<p>To be clear, I am not asking about areas that are directly threatened by the flames, but there are many places that are relatively far away from the fires but are still unhealthy to hike in due to receiving many wind-borne pm2.5 particulates from the fire (which are apparently the main health hazard).</p>

<p>Are there are any good ways to mitigate the smoke?  I looked into face masks and there are some that claim to be suitable for exercise (not sure if there's any truth to that).  However, it seems that it can be difficult to tell if the mask fits properly and if it does not then it will not provide a proper seal and will be ineffective.  </p>

<p>I'd be very interested to hear about any effective methods for dealing with the smoke.</p>
","<p>I'm literally in the thick of the smoke right now, fires are burning a half hour upwind of me, and ash has been falling from the sky like snow. Just this past couple weeks the government has been shutting down the backcountry to <em>all</em> access. The nearby National Park just issued a voluntary evacuation order, and they're talking about upping it to a mandatory evacuation. I have friends and family who have already been evacuated from their homes in BC because fires are burning out of control.</p>

<p>Hiking in the backcountry is simply not advisable at this time. But depending where you are, you may be far enough down wind and safe from the fire. I went on several hikes this summer with a haze of smoke in the air, but not enough to warrant the use of a mask. </p>

<p>If you're in smoke thick enough to need a mask, then chances are you're too close to the fire and probably shouldn't be putting yourself at risk of getting trapped out in the backcountry. You're only going to complicate the efforts of emergency response crews if you do. Be sure that you know where the fire danger is <strong>before</strong> you go out on your hike, and do not put yourself in the path of of anything.</p>

<p>If you are far enough removed from the fire that it won't present any danger, then the best thing to take along with you would be a pollution mask, which are purpose built for being worn outdoors in poor air quality   while being moderately active (walking around/cycling/commuting etc.). There is a selection of rather stylish masks <a href=""https://www.amazon.ca/Cambridge-Mask-Company-Respirator-Adjustable/dp/B0725YPXN6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1504709064&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=polution%2Bmask&amp;th=1"" rel=""noreferrer"">available on Amazon</a>.</p>

<p>But in general, wearing a mask is not the best way to protect your health during a smoke event. In fact, masks may lead to a false sense of security, which may encourage increased physical activity and time spent outdoors, meaning increased exposure to smoke. They can also make breathing more difficult. It's best to stay indoors, and avoid the smoke altogether.</p>

<p>Most all of my motion pictures are of wasps climbing on the lens which does me no good. </p>
","<p>Forget the DEET. That's for mosquitoes, and it's not a repellent, but rather it interferes with their sense of smell so since they can't smell you (food) they don't bother you. It's also toxic.</p>

<p>Citronella is not a repellent of any kind. Smoke from Citronella candles is a repellent (downwind from the candle). Smoke from ANY candle is the same repellent. There have been many, many studies on this, but the legends live on. </p>

<p>Safe for clothing &amp; gear. I spray all my outdoor clothing and gear every spring, then need to reapply it in the fall.  </p>

<p>You can find it in cans at REI and other outdoor stores. I buy the concentrated stuff off of Amazon, then dilute it and apply it with a garden sprayer.  </p>

"Winter Camping: How to warm up your boots in the morning?","2929","","<p>Is there a good technique to warm up your boots in the morning?  Should you just put them on and warm them up with your feet or is there a better alternative?  </p>
","<p>I have found sleeping with my boots inside the bag is the ONLY way to go when it is really cold out. Moderately cold, sure you can tough out the re-thaw in the morning - but real cold... forget it.</p>

<p>It is tough to get over the psychological barrier of putting boots in your bag - but it will make a difference. A few points to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>During the day, sweat builds up in your boots. Leaving them out at night, this freezes, meaning that not only do you have cold, frozen boots in the morning, if you do manage to get them thawed, they are still damp (BAD). Dry boots are a necessity**.</li>
<li>If your boots have liners, separate them from the shell, and put both in your bag with you. (Even if you don't have liners, take out the insoles to facilitate drying.)</li>
<li>If it is truly cold, no amount of running, jumping, sticking them in the sun will warm them up in a reasonable amount of time. You are putting yourself at risk of cold injuries.</li>
<li>On the subject of cold injuries - trench foot, etc, results from prolonged exposure to cool damp conditions. Several days of un-dried boots can cause lasting issues.</li>
<li>Heavy duty boots can be impossible to put on if they are well and truly frozen - the leather/plastic/liners are so stiff, it would take a contortionist to get your feet in.</li>
</ul>

<p>** <em>Some people swear by plastic socks (gore tex, nylon, or even plastic bags) to trap the moisture your foot generates inside the bag before it reaches your boot. Although this keeps your boots dry, it can make for a miserable squishy hiking/skiing experience -- but might be the only way to keep your boots dry during prolonged exposure.</em></p>

<p>If you can't stomach your boots in your bag (it is not that bad, really) you can try the following fuel or time-intensive measures:</p>

<ul>
<li>Boil water, pour it in nalgene type (well sealing) bottles and cram those as far down in your boots as you can.</li>
<li>Hold boots over stove / fire for as long as it takes (be aware of melt-age).</li>
<li>Camp somewhere with ready access to early morning sun. Place boots on closed-cell foam pad in direct sunlight. &lt;-- Though at -25F, no amount of sun will do it...</li>
<li>Consider hand/toe warmers (chemical based heat machines) to put in your boots with your feet to facilitate rapid warming.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bonus Protips:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Make sure your socks are dry as well by sleeping with them close to your body at night. I have found draping them over my shoulders/chest, directly against my skin gets them dry by morning.</li>
<li>Down booties are great for keeping your toes toasty until the last possible moment before the boots go back on. <strong>It is easier to stay warm than to get warm.</strong></li>

"Do kevlar sacks work against bears?","2920","","<p>We ran into a hiker on the AT last year using a kevlar back to keep out bears and rodents.  He said the product was an <a href=""http://www.ursack.com/product8.html"">Ursack</a> and seemed very happy with it.  However he'd never had a bear try to get into it.</p>

<p>Will a kevlar sack actually prevent a bear from getting to food in the sack?</p>

<p>(Yes, it's still best to hang anyways, but I'd like to know if this would work assuming the bear got the bag down).</p>
","<p>A fuller history:  They were approved for a few years (2004-2007) for use in Yosemite, which is a proving ground for bear-resistant containers.  In 2007 I believe there were a couple incidents where bears were able to puncture an Ursack and ""suck"" food out of it.  This led Yosemite to ban them from the park (and ultimately some other national parks followed suit).  Since then, Ursack has released new versions it claims work better, along with an aluminum liner (that basically turns it into a more traditional container).  </p>

<p>In my personal experience, I have used an Ursack with an odor-proof liner (Ursack sells these as well) on the PCT, CDT, and many other trails in black bear and grizzly country.  I'm not sure how well the Ursack itself would hold up to a sustained attack by a determined bear.  My experience suggests that the odor-proof liner does it's job well enough though - I've had bears and other pests (rats, mice, etc) in my camp and they never seem to figure out where the food is, even if I've left it right by my tent.  The worst I've had is mice a couple times nibbling at the seams of the bag (no damage done).</p>

<p>From what I've heard from other hikers, you almost have to ""defend"" your Ursack from bears.  You tie your Ursack to a tree nearer to your camp than you normally would do a hang.  If you hear a bear going after it, you're going to have to actually do something - make noise, throw rocks, whatever, to get it to go away.  Because the Ursack is a soft container, even if a bear doesn't get in, it's going to slobber all over everything, crush all your food into mushy bits, and generally make a mess.  </p>

<p>All that being said, it has one obvious, major advantage over traditional containers - weight :)  7oz vs 2 lbs 9oz for a <a href=""http://www.rei.com/product/768902/bearvault-bv500-food-container"" rel=""nofollow"">comparably sized container</a>!</p>

"How to clean vomit from camping gear?","2892","","<p>Some background. Whilst car camping down in Weymouth recently I was unfortunate enough to encounter a stomach bug (we initially thought it was food poisoning but later realised it was a bug as my other half developed the same symptoms over 3 days later). I ended up making a mess inside the tent, though not as bad as it could have been (this one was mostly just water).</p>

<p>My sleeping bag became unusable however, and this was on the first night, so I slept under a blanket instead, as luckily the weather was still surprisingly warm for September. My other half kindly cleaned up as best he could - the tent seemed to wipe clean ok and was done immediately - but my pack and my sleeping bag took the brunt of the mess.</p>

<p>Since we were only there for two nights we just chucked most things effected into the back of the car, but obviously if we had been trekking instead of car camping this would not be possible.</p>

<p>My sleeping bag is synthetic and machine washable (as stated by the manufacturer on low heat, no or low spin and only a tiny bit of detergent, no fabric softeners) and now lovely and clean. Again, this isn't exactly something I can manage out on a trek in the future - plus we had plenty of towels with us due to swimming etc, which we probably would not have with us trekking. Also as vomit is a rather nasty thing to clean up anyway, I'm not worried if things get <strong>dirty</strong> but obviously vomit is completely <strong>unhygienic</strong>, so I would assume it need something more thorough than a splash in a stream like you do with grubby boots. </p>

<p>So my question is: <strong>When out trekking, what is the best way to clean camping gear of vomit?</strong></p>
","<p>I'll caveat this with -- I've never vomited in my gear, nor do I know anyone who has.  But I did sit and figure out how I'd try to solve this if it happened to me.  </p>

<ol>
<li>Dry the liquid.  This will depend on gear and season.  Sunshine,
freezing cold, or dirt can all work for this.  Even cooking
materials such as flour can work.  Anything to make it less liquid.</li>
<li>Scrape off the resulting dry stuff/goo.</li>
<li>Let it air out as long as possible, preferably in sunlight.</li>
<li>When completely dry, scrape again and brush over with a small amount
of hand sanitizer.</li>
</ol>

<p>Again, it's theory, but this is how I actually clean up vomit anyways, just applied to gear.  There are a lot of variables that could matter here, such as location, weather, etc.</p>

<p>Lastly, please do NOT use a stream or water source.  It should go without saying, but contaminating the water for everyone else is bad.</p>

<p>Is there any particular way we can tie that part so that the weight is not focused on one particular part of our body or we can tighten or loosen it depending on the situation during the hike?</p>
","<p>Do you have 2 split rings (keyrings) with you? If so, here's how to make a buckle like that (or rather its D-ring predecessor):</p>

<p>Attach both split rings to the upper strap, where the old buckle is/was.  Pass the lower strap up through both split rings and back through the first.  </p>

<p>Here's an ASCII-art sketch before you pull it tight:</p>

<pre><code>    -----
    | //|
    |//  -//------- Lower strap, free end
    //---//-------------------- Lower strap, weight-bearing part
---//---//-
  //   // |
-----------   Upper strap (stitched loop)


// represents split rings
</code></pre>

<p>It won't hold <em>as well as</em> the original buckle, you'll need to adjust it more often, but I've used this for medium-term repairs quite successfully.  Normal keyring size split rings work well for the 20-25mm webbing tapes used on backpacks. </p>

"What is the effect of changing side and edge bevel on ski edges?","2880","","<p>I'm always struggling with how edge bevel and side bevel affect my ski's behavior, and accurately grinding those bevels.</p>

<p>What are the effects of various edge and side bevels on the ski behavior, and how do you accurately set those bevels when tuning the ski?</p>
","<p>No answers yet, so I'll put in my 2 cents.</p>

<p>A more aggressive edge (3+ degrees) bevel will cut into ice better, improving turns, but making the skis more itchy (squirrel-y?). A less aggressive edge (0-1 degree) won't bite as easily, but wears down slower and is more comfortable to ride for beginners.</p>

<p>The base bevel and side bevel can both be changed, but typically you only sharpen from the sides once everything is set.</p>

<p>There are two ways to apply this angle change. One is by eye, using a file. This method isn't very reliable for a consistent angle, but unless you're skiing really hard you probably will do just fine. You can wrap a little tape around your file to tilt it upwards a hair as a simple guide.</p>

<p>The next method is using a fixed bevel tool or a multi-angle tool. Ski shops use the fixed ones because they are the most reliable and consistent, but they are also more expensive (for reference, see <a href=""http://www.tognar.com/beast-base-ski-bevel-guides/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this bevel tool</a>, which costs $20, and you only have one bevel option). These tools typically accept either a diamond stone or regular file.</p>

<p>Don't forget to de-tune the first few inches of your skis when you're done! To ""de-tune,"" you run a file at a perfect tangent to the edge (you are making it <em>slightly</em> dull, taming that beautiful sharp edge you just made) for the first few inches of the ski's edge (beginning around the point where it will actually contact the snow). You do this because a very sharp tip or tail edge can cause your skis to be difficult to control. Imagine catching a sharp edge that far from the controlling force of your foot - not fun. </p>

<p>There are several good websites that provide more detail and specifics, including <a href=""http://www.tognar.com/bevel_edge_tips_file_bevel_ski_snowboard.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Tognar Toolworks</a>, which has a detailed write-up. I doubt I could write something better here.</p>

<p>In that occasion, the water was not <em>that</em> muddy, but it was muddy enough not to look clear - it had a very light brownish colour - and to <em>taste</em> ""groundy"" as well, despite my care in collecting it on the top of the small stream (which made a difference).</p>

<p>I boiled it; for quite some time (one good minute of hard boiling), so I assume it was very safe from a bacteriological point of view.</p>

<p>I am wondering though: <strong>there may be any health dangers caused by drinking all that tiny debris?</strong></p>

<p>And, unhealthy or safe, it still tasted bad. Are there any - possibly simple and lightweight - ways to filter that? 
Like, may a coffee filter help? Or, what could/should be used, assuming that the water contains no dangerous chemicals and that the biological dangers are removed by boiling?</p>

<p>Please notice that this is not a generic question about water purification but it's <strong>very specific to debris</strong> and to lightweight backpacking.</p>
","<p>The terms to google on seem to be ""turbidity,"" ""total suspended solids,"" and ""total dissolved solids."" TSS refers to solids that can be eliminated by a filter, and TDS to solids that are in particles so small that they get through a filter.

<p>It sounds like drinking water with dirt in it is not usually a problem in and of itself, but may be correlated with the presence of disease-causing organisms or nasty stuff like pesticides and fertilizers. Of course if the alternative is to get seriously dehydrated, you're going to have to take your chances by drinking the water.</p>

"What is the safest and most effective additive to keep drinking water from freezing?","2866","","<p>I know that the antifreeze used in fresh water RV tanks is non-toxic and can protect to -50F.</p>

<p>Thinking Sugar might be a good choice I posted the question <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/10623"">How to calculate how much sugar to use as antifreeze in drinking water?</a> from <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/10623/how-to-calculate-how-much-sugar-to-use-as-antifreeze-in-drinking-water/10625#10625"">the answer</a> it looks like you don't get much real benefit for reasonable amounts of sugar.</p>

<p>So what potable/drinkable additive can I use to keep my drinking water from freezing?  How much of it do I need to use to get to protect at different temperatures.  </p>

<p>Optimally the answer includes a chart that shows the volume to add per unit of water, for an anticipated temperature.</p>
","<p>There are two natural options; none of them is quite pleasant.</p>

<h2>Alcohol</h2>

<p>Per <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol_%28data_page%29#Properties_of_aqueous_ethanol_solutions"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>, 8.5 vol% of ethanol make the freezing point drop to -3C (26.6F) (more values at at Wikipedia, also a diagram is available below).</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4FzqL.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4FzqL.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Most of the ethanol will be evaporized during cooking, so it's not that much an issue; also 14 vol% is only 6.8 wt%, so the added weight is 6.8%, which sounds like a lot, but still it's 1/15 only. The good thing is that you can get cheap and quite strong alcohol almost anywhere around the world. Of course, this has some issues, such as where to get spare alcohol for a longer journey; also, some alcohol will be always left in the solution, no matter how hard you try, which is not good at winter.</p>

<p>Note that you can get a 90% alcohol at special shops, but it can get quite expensive because of the excise tax. <strong>Don't buy technical alcohol, it's denaturated, i.e. very disguisting and possibly not really safe to drink</strong>.</p>

<h2>Salts</h2>

<p>Note that you can't really do much with salts. The most efficient salt is NaF (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_fluoride"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sodium fluoride</a>). <a href=""https://van.physics.illinois.edu/qa/listing.php?id=18705"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">We can compute</a> that 34 grams of NaF in 1 litre of water reduce the freezing point to -3C. However, that's 3.4 wt%, which is a freaking lot, your meals will be very salty with an edible but quite strange salt. (It's used sometimes as a source of fluoride, so you should be fine, but I haven't found any information on the effects of consumption of significant amounts of NaF).</p>

<p>For NaCl (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_chloride"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">kitchen salt</a>), the amount to get to -3C is 47 grams, so almost 5%. Since the relationship is linear, any reasonable amount of salt has close to zero effect on the freezing point.</p>

<p>Do not do this. Find other methods how to supply yourself drinking water in extreme conditions.</p>

"Reusing the same water bottle for drinking tap water","2858","","<p>Recently, I've started drinking more and more tap water instead of buying bottles all the time (which is usually absolutely no issue in Germany).</p>

<p>I like to use a bottle for that not fill a glass all the time. At the moment, I'm using 1-l-bottles like <a href=""http://www.tgh24.de/WebRoot/Store10/Shops/62063627/4A16/7B43/8BD5/FF01/CDB7/C0A8/28BB/BEF8/3106_0020_RS_0020_Sprudel.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a>. They're meant to be reused, and the plastic is harder than for single-use bottles. I could not find the exact kind of plastic, though.</p>

<p>My question is be how often and how I have to clean that bottle. I'm drinking directly from it, but I'm not sharing it and using only tap water, nothing else. I'm refilling it around three times a day approximately.</p>

<p>Is rinsing the bottle opening with tap water once a day and using dish soap once a week reasonable, or more than necessary, or not enough?</p>
","<p>If your water source is clean and assuming you are a relatively clean person in a fairly clean environment (not working in sanitation), You can probably get away with never cleaning it and not get sick.  Tap water usually has some chlorine in it to keep basic bacteria and virus levels low.  So refilling it with this water will keep the general levels low inside the bottle.</p>

<p>Contamination will primarily come from you -- your hands and mouth.  Your body is constantly fighting off bacteria and viruses and the levels you transfer to the bottle will be quite low and easy for your body to kill.  However if bacteria left unexposed to the cleansing tap water (like trapped under a piece of food or debris) they can multiply.  In these cases the most common bacterias will alter the flavor of the water, however your body will easily fight them off.</p>

<p>Unless you are sick or very unclean (wiping the lip of the bottle with dirty hands), the amount of harmful animals transfered to the bottle will be very small.</p>

<p>Allowing the bottle surfaces to completely dry will kill a large range of bacteria, and rinsing/washing occasionally will also remove debris where they can breed.</p>

<p>An occasional rinse with vinegar will help destroy both viruses and bacteria on many of the hidden surfaces that the chlorinated tap water isn't strong enough to penetrate completely.  Vinegar is also non-toxic to drink.</p>

<p>For example I live in the tropics where bacteria and viruses thrive in the heat and humidity.  In our case the water is chlorinated, but the water is filtered through a charcoal filter before being placed into the bottle to reduce the chlorine levels (the bottle itself does not get the benefit of the chlorine to clean it).  With daily use (and drying, but not washing) it can take several months before a water bottle starts to taste off and a vinegar rinse removes it.  We also store water in water bottles that we do not put in our mouths, but pour directly from them.  In this case, they are on their second year of never being washed and are fine.</p>

"When to use a static rope?","2853","","<p>I usually do <a href=""/questions/tagged/sport-climbing"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;sport-climbing&#39;"" rel=""tag"">sport-climbing</a> so I've never owned a static rope.</p>

<p>However, most rope-related Q&amp;As in TGO.SE don't bother specifying dynamic vs static ropes.</p>

<p>I've been told that for <a href=""/questions/tagged/rappelling"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;rappelling&#39;"" rel=""tag"">rappelling</a> (or even <a href=""/questions/tagged/canyoneering"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;canyoneering&#39;"" rel=""tag"">canyoneering</a>) it's not only pretty common, but actually advised to avoid elongation when you're not expecting it.</p>

<p>On the other hand I know you should avoid at all costs using a static rope when climbing.</p>

<p>But other than that, when is the use of a static rope recommended?</p>
","<p><strong>Static ropes</strong> are used whenever you're working with a static load, either raising or lowering. <br><strong>Dynamic ropes</strong> should be used whenever there is potential for a fall and high impact forces. </p>

<p>Static ropes are used for <em>rappelling/abseiling, ascending, hauling, rescue work and making anchors (accessory cord)</em>. Pretty much they are to be used in every situation except for catching a fall. </p>

<p>On rappels, static ropes (9-11mm) give you more control on your descent, with dynamic ropes it's often very temping to descend faster because the rope will soak up a lot of the force when you come to a stop, while fun to do, it's not great for your gear or your anchors, you could also put yourself into a dangerous situation by lowering too fast and hitting something or losing control. </p>

<p>If you've ever tried to ascend a dynamic rope then you know that it is almost twice as tiring as ascending a static rope, it's the same difference as climbing up stairs vs, hiking up a sand dune. The stretch and bounce in the rope puts excess fatigue on your muscles with every motion, you also feel like you have to climb twice as far because you have to take the stretch out of the rope before you can make any vertical progress. </p>

<p>Hauling is done on big wall climbs typically using >7.5mm ropes when you're climbing for multiple days and carrying a lot of gear, static ropes are much easier and faster to pull.</p>

<p>In rescue work, large diametre 13mm ropes are pretty much standard, because they regularly have more than one person on a rope and lift victims strapped to a spine board in a basket. You want zero stretch in your rope when you're doing this kind of work, because before you can lift a load you have to first take all the stretch out of it, and when you're dealing with a spinal injury you don't want your rig to bounce around. They also use very complex pulley systems, with dynamic ropes, you would have to pull way more rope through the system. </p>

<p>Accessory cord can be categorized as any static rope that is &lt;8mm, it's used to make cordalettes, equalettes, any other kind of anchor or 'lette you can think of, slings, prusiks <em>(although dynamic prusik cord is better, static cords still work)</em>, and back in the day it was used in <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/7527/why-all-the-different-accessory-cord-diameters"">every size</a> down to 2mm to thread your chocks. You're really only limited by your imagination when it comes down to what you can use accessory cord for.  </p>

<p>Dynamic ropes are used to absorb shock forces sustained from a fall, if you were to use a static rope for free-climbing the force of a fall would rip your protection out of the wall, snap the rope, or snap you in half when your fall is caught and you stop very suddenly and abruptly. </p>

"What is this dense foam on a lake?","2850","","<p>Recently we visited the alps in Bavaria. We hiked near a lake which had a lot of foam swimming on it. It was not spray from the water but rather a really dense dirty foam. Comparable to shaving foam I guess. </p>

<p>Where does such foam originate from? </p>

<p>P.S.: I've seen such foam also on other waters already. It just was somehow this time that it made me wonder. </p>
","<p>It's ""foam line"" (though I believe there are other names)</p>

<p>It occurs when there are surfactants in water, which is then agitated, resulting in foam forming. This foam then tends to clump together and collect debris along the way. </p>

<p>It happens naturally, especially in  fast-flowing rivers or larger lakes in boggy areas. </p>

<p>It can also be caused by pollution - eg. from agricultural run-off, human waste or industrial pollution. </p>

<p>(Note: it isn't an algal bloom as mentioned in another answer, but can occur in tandem as 1. Organic matter in the water can cause both foam and algal bloom 2. As the algi decompose it adds organic matter which causes foaming.)</p>

"How to Shoo away a stubborn Stray Dog/Dogs who decides to tag along with you on a hike?","2816","","<p>This happened on one of my hikes. 
It was a hike with two villages en route. Somehow a dog from the first village decided to stick with us. We were OK with it. Then he was followed by a small Puppy. Now we tried to shoo them away but they still decided to tag along. When we reached the second village, the dogs from that village joined us too. So now there were 5 dogs with us. They were with us for the whole hike. </p>

<p>It was raining so water wasn't an issue for them, but we couldn't feed them, this was a few hours of hike so that wasn't an issue either.</p>

<p><strong>What are the implications (If there are any) when a few dogs/puppies decide to stick with you on a hike?</strong></p>

<p><strong>How do you shoo away a stubborn dog/dogs/pup/puppies, for their own safety? (I think it't not safe say for a stray pup to join you on a hike, considering that it might get displaced/lost/hunted).</strong></p>
","<p>I think the biggest issue here is that you're likely to find strays won't respond to commands that, for a normal dog, would work at keeping them from following (stay or wait).</p>

<p>I've actually had this experience as well when walking along a canal with my husband, a narrow boat owners dog followed us for a good 200 yards before we walked him back and got them to take him inside. Unfortunately with a stray, or dogs that are allowed to freely wander, there's usually no one to give them back to.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What are the implications(If there are any) when a few dogs/puppies decide to stick with you on a hike?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the dogs point of view:</p>

<p>For a <strong>stray dog</strong> probably very little, most dogs have a good directional sense and can probably make it back to wherever they call home without an issue. </p>

<p>For an <strong>owned dog walking free</strong> probably again little - however, if the dog has tags, try and return it to its owner as it may have actually wandered off without them wanting it to. </p>

<p>For <strong>any puppy</strong> depending on age, probably this is the least favourable walking companion as for one, puppies don't have fully developed bones until approximately a year old, their bones are soft, and long hikes are never advised by vets until about 6 months old. They can damage their bones when they're still soft from walking too much. Also, puppies are much more susceptible to diseases like parvovirus, and other viruses which are spread by rats urine (commonly found along rivers and water sources).</p>

<p>From a hikers point of view:</p>

<p>Irritation is probably the biggest factor. You may find issues if the dogs are aggressive or there are a large number of them in a pack. If this is the case, try avoiding going near the dogs in the first place. </p>

<p>This <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/a/9675/3313"">answer</a> gives great information about dealing with wild dogs, especially if they are aggressive. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How do you shoo away a stubborn dog/dogs/pup/puppies, for their own safety?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <em>usual</em> way to get a dog to stop unwanted behaviour is to ignore them - this is a very powerful tool for a human as dogs want eye contact. Don't look at the dog and don't speak to it. Any form of attention to attention deprived dogs (so positive OR negative) will fulfil the need, common in owned dogs in the form of separation anxiety.</p>

<p>Also <strong>do not</strong> run from the dog! This is a game, you are prey, you're invoking the dogs natural want to chase. And stay calm, if you calmly walk away from the dogs they'll likely get bored. If there are locals around you can ask them to help you out, especially if the dog is known to them.</p>

"Should I spray a 'good' raincoat with 'water proof' spray?","2809","","<p>I come from a family where outdoors activities include picknick baskets and a time limit of four hours tops. However, my girlfriends family loves taking me on outdoor holidays, the kind where you won't see another human being for a few days. During last years holiday, my cheap coat was clearly insufficient to withstand anything more than a light Spanish shower, so they surprised me with a 'good' outdoor raincoat for our upcoming canoeing trip to Canada.</p>

<p>Usually, I sprayed my coats with some kind of water-proof spray before use to make it at least a little water- and dustproof, since <em>'you should always do that before first use'</em>. However, this coat has some kind of high-tech breathing fabric that I'm not familiar with, and the labels did not provide any directions on whether (not to) spray the coat before first use.</p>

<p>So, my question: should I or should I not use water-proof spray on a 'professional' outdoors jacket? If yes, should I invest in a good spray from an outdoors shop, or will an all-purpose spray do? Or will this actually do more harm than good?</p>

<p>Specifically, it's Venturi ® fabric from Schöffel.  <a href=""http://www.schoeffel.de/shop/sterling/"">Link to the coat in question (if that's allowed)</a></p>
","<p>From a website giving information on jackets, specifically for <a href=""http://www.whatjacket.info/jacket-fabrics/venturi"">""Venturi"" fabric</a>, the material appears to be similar to GoreTex, etc. and recommended washing is given as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The durability of Venturi is dependent on proper care. Regular and correct care has a positive effect on the durability of the membrane. Unless otherwise stated, wash in the washing machine with similar colours on a gentle wash at 30°C or 40°C,   taking care to close all zips, Velcro fastenings and press studs and turning the item inside out before washing. Liquid detergent specifically for membrane clothing can be used and detergent residue can be avoided by rinsing the garment until water is clear, however the use of fabric softener is not recommended. It is better to care for the garment often with a little detergent than rarely with a lot of detergent . After washing, the garment can be spun briefly on the gentlest setting. Impregnation is one of the basic requirements for supporting the membrane’s function.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition to regular washing, all breathable fabrics need some sort of treatment to allow water to bead on the surface, to assist with breathability. To check this, try pouring a little water on your jacket's surface and see if it beads or wets out. If you find the water beads (forms into droplets which roll off the fabric) then all is well. If not, then using a spray which helps the fabric repel water (such as those sold by NikWax or Grangers, at least here in the UK, but I'm sure similar products are available in other locations) would be a good idea.  </p>

"Why don't people in the UK use snowshoes?","2809","","<p>I was recently in the mountains of snowdownia in thick snow. It was about 2 foot (about 0.6m) in places.

<p>It occurred to me that snowshoes would be perfect in this situation. At the same time it occurred to me that I have never ever seen anyone in the UK use snow shoes, or for that matter a shop sell them.</p>

<p>Is there a practical reason for this or is it simply because snow in the UK is so transitive?</p>

<p>Bear in mind that most of the slope was of a lesser gradient than above</p>
","<p>This is really interesting, and I think it might be similar to why we don't generally have snow tires / chains etc as a common item here in stores. Certainly the South rarely gets snow, with Wales, The North and Scotland being more likely to get snow days.</p>

<p>From the MET Office:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The UK gets on average 33 days of snow fall or sleet a year (1971 - 2000). Most of this is snow falling on higher ground where temperatures are lower.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also from the MET office:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>How much snow settles?</strong></p>
  
  <p>Much of this snow fall does not settle, and the figures for snow on the ground (snow lying) are much lower. On average across the UK there's only 16.5 days a year when snow is on the ground, compared to 27.7 days in Scotland. Again, most of the snow on the ground can be found in mountainous areas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Without going too in depth into marketing... stores are very likely to sell what they know a consumer is likely to buy, and in numbers. If you'll note snow shovels and sledges turn up in UK stores in winter and certainly in the South they are plastic, and not likely to be used (or last if they are!). They will sell well when people are going to <em>panic buy</em> and therefore the quality can be low due to an unlikeliness to sell but not many people will panic buy snow shoes. The stores we have would prefer to cater to weather they can guarantee we will have... rain is more common all year round - you're more likely to find waders than snow shoes in our stores.</p>

<p>Ideally if you want something that companies like Blacks, Millets (acutally owned by Blacks), Sports Direct, Go Outdoors, Trespass etc might consider specialised, you're better off buying online as they might not keep the items in stock, as here I would say they would very likely come under <em>seasonal stock</em>. </p>

<p>As a note Blacks (and others) have 'Snow Boots' but they certainly look more fashionable than servicable, being more like very winter wellies... So lack of continuous snow and availability would be why people are less likely to use them.</p>

"How safe is sleeping in bear country?","2788","","<p>We have recently <a href=""https://picasaweb.google.com/109271680907792241347/VelkaFatra"">hiked in Slovakian mountains</a> where bears live. I’m not too concerned about the bears during the day, as we make enough noise to avoid an encounter. But I am not sure about sleeping there.</p>

<p>We slept in bivy sacks in the open, I hung our food on a tree somewhat distant from our sleeping place and generally followed all the usual suggested precautions. But when we could hear the bear grumbling in the woods in the night, we were pretty scared anyway. I feared that the bear might get quite close without us noticing, and I’d hate that.</p>

<p>How safe is sleeping in the open in a bear country, then? Is the general idea that the bear will simply not notice? That the area is large enough to make the encounter improbable unless we do something wrong, like cook in the camp?</p>
","<p>With the exceptions of grizzly bears and polar bears, bears are nuisance animals that are after your food. They have no interest in you except as a source of food or as an obstacle to obtaining your food. In specific, extremely popular camping areas (e.g., Yosemite Valley), bears become habituated to people and are much more common, so they are more of a nuisance. The farther you get away from popular areas, the fewer bears you will see and the less likely they'll be to be habituated to humans. Sleeping in the open is no better or worse than sleeping in a tent; a tent is not a barrier to a bear. If you don't want to be bothered by bear noise at night, store your food far away from where you're sleeping. If you use a bear canister rather than tying your food in a tree, then the bear may be more likely to give up quickly rather than keeping you awake all night. I usually put my bear canister about 30 meters from where I sleep.</p>

"Men using a women's trekking backpack","2785","","<p>I'm planning a trekking in Torres del Paine (Chile) and El Chaten (Argentina) and my actual backpack has 50l and I'm afraid 50l isn't enough for a 20 day trip with 10 days trekking. </p>

<p>A friend of mine is selling a women's <a href=""http://www.deuter.com/CH/fr/trekking/aircontact-pro-55-plus-15-sl-33813-1435.html"">Aircontact PRO 55 + 15 SL</a>.</p>

<p>Can I use a backpack designed for women? </p>

<p>I am about 170cm and 86kg.</p>
","<p>The short answer is, ""it depends"".  Packs sold to women may have only superficial changes compared to the men's version (i.e. the color is different), but there are usually a few common differences:</p>

<ol>
<li>Shorter torso length (distance from shoulder to hip, often shorter in women).</li>
<li>Narrower shoulder straps (men tend to have broader shoulders).</li>
<li>Shape of shoulder straps (sometimes you'll see S-curved straps to fit better around breasts).</li>
<li>Size and shape of the hip belt.</li>
</ol>

<p>Except for item 3, which is less common, these differences aren't inherently female-specific.  It's not uncommon for women to use men's packs and <em>vice versa</em>.  The best recommendation is to try the pack on and see how it fits.  An incorrect torso length will probably stand out the most, but be cautious of how well the hip and shoulder straps fit.  For extended trekking purposes, it's worth loading your pack with its expected weight and spending a good amount of time (at least 15-30 minutes) walking around with it on.</p>

<p>Finally, if the larger pack doesn't end up fitting, all is not lost; there are ways to do longer treks with smaller packs if you have the time to make some changes to your packing list.</p>

","<p>To answer the original question: At no point is the cord so small that you need to seriously worry about it cutting through the attachment points. Unless you pulling it through at high speed under pressure.</p>

<p>Under normal use conditions there is not enough friction at these points to cut through (even if high winds) and simply being small won't make it blast through.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if one is better for belaying, anchoring, or if it's purely preference. I would think that the smaller ones would be nicer all-around, but I may be missing a use case for larger carabiners.</p>
","<p>Typically a small biner is fine. The larger ones are useful in a number of scenarios though, for example rigging a belay where you have multiple anchors each tied into your carabiner, the bigger biner gives you more space to add clove hitches, etc. This is only really applicable to trad climbing where you build complex belays with 2+ anchors spread out on a cliff that need equalising, etc. </p>

<p>You'll likely find the big biner will take a larger load too so it's safer if it's cross loaded, etc. (though this, as mentioned is highly variable)</p>

"Safe, effective method for splitting firewood using a hatchet?","2767","","<p>While car camping this past weekend, I bought some firewood from the park headquarters but unfortunately, it was split into very large pieces that obviously wouldn't light very well. I tried splitting it by using a hatchet and another log to hit it, but this wood was very hard and not splitting using this method. That said, I've always been hesitant to use a hatchet with full swinging power, which is probably what this log needed.</p>

<p>What is a safe and effective method for splitting hard firewood logs using a hatchet?</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y4X2ym.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y4X2ym.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>
","<p>I normally baton with a large knife, but the principle remains the same (driving a wedge to split the wood). I taught myself how to baton in order to quickly make kindling from larger sections, often quarter-rounds, while my little cousin was around. Batoning can be performed on logs or thickers sticks, depending on your needs and the size of your wedge. I often find myself hacking up sections of fallen branches before batoning them into usable kindling.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Select your wedge (axe), baton (a piece of wood or plastic that fits comfortably in your hand), location (harder ground or rock, but not concrete, as it can crack), and wood (firewood, branch, etc).</p></li>
<li><p>Position your wood and wedge. Where your wedge's blade goes will depend on what you're splitting. You may be able to go straight through the center of a small-ish branch (<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/S3Bus.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">like this</a>). In the case of logs, I tend to remove lengthwise corner sections (<a href=""https://lansky.com/files/4413/7167/1580/Batoning_2.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">like this</a>). </p></li>
<li><p>Once you've positioned the wood, wedge, and have your baton in hand, begin batoning. To baton, treat the action like you're hammering a nail. Swinging too lightly won't get you anywhere, while swinging too hard initially may displace your wedge from your wood. </p></li>
<li><p>Once the wood has been split, rinse and repeat steps 1-3 to make smaller sections of wood or to process other pieces of wood.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The main reason for focusing on smaller sections of the wood/log is that it helps prevent one of the biggest problems that improper batoning has: getting your wedge stuck. This is why the majority of people who baton use a knife of decent size (more blade spine to baton while processing the wood). If the wood is not split by the time your wedge has sunk fully in the wood, you're going to have to remove it (<em>this often involves a groan, a smattering of grunts, and usually a few expletives</em>) and try a different position. After processing a few bundles worth of wood, you'll likely get the feel for what will, and will not, nicely split.</p>

<p>Safety concerns of baton selection: <strong><em>Batons should not be made of metal.</em></strong> I cannot stress this enough. Metal-on-metal contacts can damage your wedge and creates a safety hazard, such as flying shards. I have personally had to remove a few shards from the arm of my jacket when I was tired and absentmindedly used the back of an older camp axe as a baton. </p>

<p><strong>General safety:</strong> While this may seem safer, you are still swinging a solid object and working with a blade. Treat anybody who's batoning with the same considerations you would give to somebody swinging an axe. </p>

<p><em>Let me know if I left anything out or need to clarify anything.</em></p>

"Practical uses for urine","2764","","<p>When on extended outdoor excursions are there any scenarios where you can leverage urine as an efficient tool?</p>

<p>An example would be: You're in your sleeping bag in a tent and it's -30*C outside, you opt to urinate in a nalgene inside your sleeping bag and place the sealed nalgene at your feet to keep your toes warm.</p>

<p>I would like to emphasize practical uses rather than concocting dubious scenario's that ultimately are not beneficial to the readers of this question.</p>
","<p>There are many if you can adjust with smell and fact that you are going to need to use your own urine for some or the other purpose.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Hydrate using Urine:</strong> When you are damn far away from any water source and going through serius dehydration, You distill your urine if you can light a fire and have two makeshift containers, some kind of tube, and something to cover one of the containers (like a plastic bag). You put your urine in one of the containers, insert the tube, and cover the top of the container. Put the other end of the tube in the other container. The water in the urine will evaporate, leaving the undrinkable elements behind. It will travel up the tube and the condensation will run into the other container. This method is proven one and is also explained in <em>The SAS Survival Handbook.</em>  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Makeshift Gunpowder using Urine</strong> : Though historical references says that there had been an established technique for making Gunpowder, called the French Method which was commonly used during the Civil war, I personally feel, getting that accuracy for some common adventure guy like me would be out of question. But Yes, as the Gunpowder comprises of 75% potassium nitrate, 15% charcoal and 10% sulfur. We have sources for that around: Charcoal - Wood? Sulfur: dug from the ground around volcanoes? And, Potassium Nitrate: Urine? Bat poo? I actually don't have any experience in making one such, but there is a lot of saying about how that worked for people trapped in caves or under some abandoned mine.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Urine as luke warm fluid source:</strong> Usually, at higher altitudes, one of the most concerned issues for mountaineers is Frostbite. I have a teammate / mentor who eventually had to suffer a minor frostbite during an attempt, He was some 6-7 hrs far from the Advance Base Camp, and he almost got his toe frostbitten. He realized that it is not so serious yet, but it can be if not taken right preventive measures. He had lost his water can during the climb around ice walls and he needed to put the toe in warm water to asap. He was properly hydrated, and could walk down down the distance. He urinated in his socks to keep his toe warm and walked down till the Advance Base Camp. And, he recovered with absolutely no trouble to his toe. What he actually did was, He did attempt the summit, couldn't make it though, got frostbite to the toe, somehow descended before it got worse, when he was sure that he has descended sufficiently well and to the safer altitude where there is no sub-zero temperatures, then he took the gamble to urinate in his socks, just being sure that it won't freeze.</p></li>

"For how long afterwards do we benefit from acclimatization?","2751","","<p>Consider we are trying to pre-acclimate for an expedition in Himalaya to shorten the actual timespan on site.</p>

<p>As an example, I am expecting a benefit if I go in the Alps for several days above 4000m and sleep over 3000m. If my trip to the big mountains like the Himalayas starts a week (or two) after that <em>pre-tour</em> am I still acclimated to some extent? If so are there approximations (maybe scientific studies) for how long the acclimatization benefit holds on and to what degree?</p>

<hr>

<p><em>Edit to further explain the matter:</em></p>

<p>I am not asking the question because of a specific planned tour in Himalaya. I am interested in general, first to understand better how acclimatization really works and second to possibly shorten the (sometimes very expensive) acclimatization time. Of course it would be the best preparation to stay in Himalaya for a long time and acclimate slowly. But it should make a considerable difference if I am acclimated to my home-town at 500m or to 3500m. The question is how big this difference will be.</p>
","<p>Altitude acclimatization is not just a single change in your body but a long list of different things that are going on. There is a nice chart on p. 326 of House and Johnston, Training for the New Alpinism, which gives a list of the following adaptations (they label #6 as two items):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>increased ventilation rate</p></li>
<li><p>increased heart rate and blood pressure</p></li>
<li><p>blood pH increases</p></li>
<li><p>decrease in plasma volume</p></li>
<li><p>increase in red blood cell mass and hemoglobin concentration</p></li>
<li><p>decrease in size of muscle cells, and consequent increase in capillary density</p></li>
<li><p>increased density of mitochondria</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Your question is about how long it takes to lose the adaptation, but that doesn't seem to have been studied very thoroughly, so I'll start by relating the more well established information on how long it takes to gain the various adaptations and then circle back and try to answer your question somewhat. For each of the items above, House and Johnston give a ""time for adaptation to begin"" and a ""time to end."" I think the ""time to end"" means how long it takes until you're fully adapted. The time to begin is zero for 1-2, a few days for 3-4, hours for 5, and weeks for 6-7. The time to end is weeks to months for everything except 4, which is supposed to be complete in 1-2 days. #3 only happens above 5000 m, so you won't experience it at all from being at those altitudes in the Alps, but you can get the same effect by just taking acetazolamide (diamox).</p>

<p>OK, so what about de-acclimatization? House and Johnston have a short section about this on p. 358, titled ""How fast do you de-acclimate?"" It seems to be short because there's not a lot of solid evidence. In one study, people spent 16 days at 4000 m, then went to sea level for 7 days, and then went up to 4300 and were tested. ""They were found to retain about 50% of their acclimatization."" Unfortunately, House and Johnston don't give a reference to who did this study. I would like to know, e.g., by what measure the 50% is computed. In another study, called ""Operation Everest III,"" the subjects lost their elevated hemoglobin levels in only 4 days.</p>

<p>So the evidence is obviously pretty scanty and not completely consistent. House and Johnson say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When we examine our own experience, look at the historical record of high-altitude climbing, and ask others, we find that the most common rule of thumb is that you lose your adaptation to altitude at about the same rate as you gain it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everything I've said so far was general. You have a more specific trip in mind. The big question to ask would be how high you intend to go in the Himalayas and how long you intend to stay there.  It seems like the necessary acclimatization time rises very quickly with altitude. For Kilimanjaro, at 5900 m, most people take about 7 days to acclimatize. House and Johnston give some sample acclimatization schedules for higher elevations. For Denali, at 6200 m, they show 18 days as normal, 10 as a ""fast ascent."" For people climbing to 8000 m, the schedules they show are all about a month. If you're going high in the Himalayas, then realistically you're going to need weeks to adapt, and compared to that, a few days spent in the Alps is probably not going to be significant.</p>

<li>Sun protection - for a limited, but sensitive area of skin</li>
<li>Bug protection - a long-sleeve shirt/fleece with a collar turned up and long hair / beard make for a mosquito-free and DEET-free evening.</li>
<li>Warmer (in cold climates) - Beard-cicles (aside from looking grizzly rugged) do provide protection from wind and snow spray when engaged in <em>high wind-sheer activities</em> like skiing, snowmobiling or dog-sledding.</li>
<li>Low maintenance - have you tried shaving on the trail? (<em>Note: I have never once had lice, ticks, gnomes, fungus, or anything else... well any more than I have in my head hair. It's called personal hygiene...</em>)</li>
<li>Provides something to stroke when you are thinking hard about something</li>
<li>Chicks dig guys with beards -- at least a certain class of outdoorsy gal</li>
<li>Provides a handle to remove your head weight from your neck if your job requires staring up at the tree-tops all day long.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Big beards can hide the subtle curl at the corner of your lips that signifies when you are being a smart-ass causing people to mistakenly think you are just an ass.</li>
<li>More weight to carry around?...</li>
<li>Warmer (in hot climates)</li>

<p>What kind of shoes can I wear to keep warm for different outdoor activities such as cycling, snowshoeing, skiing? It doesn't have to be a single shoe, although sometimes I combine activities (cycling to starting point), so it would be a plus if it were.</p>
","<p><strong>Overshoes</strong></p>

<p>When the boots' warmth is not enough, you can use overshoes.
Basically, it's nothing more than a sack made of cloth , which you put over your boot and fasten somehow:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jouL9.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>This helps you in two ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>It creates an air pocket around your boot, reducing heat loss.</li>
<li>The snow now melts not on your boot, but on the overshoe, drastically increasing the time before your shoe gets wet (and cold).</li>
</ol>

<p>You can try to shop for something like this, but you can easily create it yourself as in the picture above: fold a cloth to make a sack, sew 3 sides of 4, add some laces and that's all. You can use any synthetic (and maybe waterproof) cloth like Oxford or Cordura.</p>

<p>If your sewing skills are higher, you might end up with something more attractive and better shaped:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/48U6U.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>(some other designs are shown <a href=""http://www.redfox.ru/news1/poleznye_aksessuary_dlya_zimy/"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>)</p>

<p>If you need to use it with SNS/NNN ski boots, make small cuts on the toe. (The other option for skiing may be removing overshoes sole and glueing the remainder to the boot - a lot of expensive ski boots are made like this, but you can add another layer;)).</p>

<p><strong>Durability upgrade</strong></p>

<p>As you may have noticed, this design implies a relatively thin fabric being between your sole and the ground, so if you are not wearing skis or crampons, it's  damaged easily. So it's recommended to make the sole of the overshoe thicker. The best thing for walking is an overshoe combined with rubbers/galoshes:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Lk6y3.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Why, you can sacrifice some huge-size rubber boots for this.</p>

<p><strong>Warmth upgrade</strong></p>

<p>Overshoes by themselves provide additional warmth, but this may be not enough. To get really warm one should add another layer - warm overshoe (""chuni"") - between the boot and the overshoe. Basically it's crafted just alike, but you use a warm cloth (e.g. Polartec-100/200) and you don't need laces.</p>

","<p>It looks like a combination of checking out a potential predator and following a leader.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Turkeys, he says, are naturally fearful of cats, which can be a threat to younger, smaller birds. So it’s likely that, when they came across a dead one in the road, <strong>they were very curious to see what was going on, and whether it was alive.</strong></p>
  
  <p>At the same time, turkeys tend to follow a leader or two as they roam through suburban yards in search of food (they have a diet mostly of nuts, grains, and berries—no cats). <strong>So if one leader took it upon itself to march around the corpse and inspect it, it makes sense that the others would follow its lead,</strong> while keeping a safe distance from the fallen feline. Hence, a near perfect circle.</p>

I don't mean the highest snow height or something. Just the time when it's white outside. :) A snow-fall analogy to the ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_duration"" rel=""nofollow"">sunshine hours</a>"".</p>

<p>I guess it's a battle between Scandinavian countries, Austria and Switzerland, isn't it? </p>
","<p>Scandinavia is a good option, the more north you go the better. For me the nature there is more remote, more 'raw' compared to the Alps. So I would think it's comparable with Canada (although I've never been to those regions).</p>

<p>If you can choose when to go, why not go during winter time. You can add late autumn and early spring too. In this timespan you could have a great time in the Alps. Either Austria or going 'deeper' that means moving more into the Western Alps. In Switzerland, France and Italy you can find the high mountains of Europe where you can hike a lot. During winter you can do really a lot of snowboarding. You find a lot of prepared tracks too. You need to know that the Alps are touristic developed pretty much that means you find a lot to do and especially lot of easy accessible activities to do.</p>

<p>I wouldn't choose just by the days with snow. There is more than that. Think of culture, cities you wanna visit or in general what you are planning to see besides mountains (although I understand your point of view -_-)</p>

<p>Here are some examples where to go if you are searching snow:

"How should I plan a backpacking trip with people who have never backpacked before?","2685","","<p>I want to go backpacking with a couple friends, but I'm the only one of us with any experience, and I mostly day hike. I've only done a couple of backpacking trips. They've never backpacked, and only hiked occasionally.</p>
","<p>I can only tell you what I do, when I am in this situation. It's tricky, and getting everyone to agree can be tough, but it works.</p>

<h2>Take charge</h2>

<p>First, <strong>be the leader</strong>. Don't just <em>suggest</em> people bring x or y, make them. Assert control over the trip and make sure to keep it. Now that doesn't mean you have to be an ass hat, but you do need to ""take charge"".  Make sure you it's clear that you're going and they are coming along. It's hard to describe, because I don't mean to suggest that you be overbearing. But for example, make sure that everyone checks their gear with you. Make sure that everyone checks their food with you.</p>

<p>When people want to split off from the group make sure they know to check with you. Make sure they have you check their tent (or whatever) before they sleep in it.</p>

<p>I know this seems silly, but your the one with experience. Be ready to suggest products and items that they will need to bring or buy. Be prepared to call the trip off if it's not going ""your way"" on a critical issue. Again, sounds bad. But if you say to bring drinking water, and someone is insisting they don't need to because you can just drink from the river, then you suggest that they get some kind of water purification system and they go ""no, river water should be fine"", you need to make the call and stop the trip.</p>

<h2>Where to go</h2>

<p>Next, <strong>choose a short trip</strong>. If it's their first time, then they may not be prepared for what hiking means. Specially if it's off trail. A 2-mile run on a track is a lot different then a 2-mile walk on a animal trail. I would suggest a 1 mile in, setup camp, 1 mile or less out arrangement. Yes, that means a lot of time at camp, but you don't want to be setting up a tent for the first time at dusk. And you <em>really</em> don't want to have to deal with muscle pain, back pain, sore feet, etc. on the way out. You want to leave them wanting more.</p>

<h2>Before the trip</h2>

<p>Third, <strong>have a planning day</strong>. Get everyone together for dinner or something and go over what the requirements are. Focus on shoes, packs, survival gear and food.  Then, on the second half of planning day head to the stores. Get everything you don't have. Be ready to answer questions about weight, what is needed and what is nice to have. I usually have to remind people that why they want to take is what they will have to carry. That usually gets them to put down the big hibachi grill and choose something more reasonable.</p>

<p>Then head to the grocery store. Get the food you want to take. Of course focus on lightweight high-energy foods. Be ready to explain your choices. Keep it simple. Canned food, beef maybe, fruits, nuts, and grains. Even though you may be comfortable preparing a lavish meal over a camp fire, it takes practice that they don't have. So stick with foods that are easy to cook, or don't require cooking. Remember to keep weight in mind. 10 pounds of steak sounds good, but remind them they they will have to carry it, and the ice to keep it edible.</p>

<p>The day before the trip, have a <strong>packing day</strong>. Invite everyone over again, and have everyone help each other pack. Make sure you try to distribute weight. Even if it means mixing items. Women usually have to be stopped from bringing to many clothes. Men have a tendency to want to bring too many gadgets. Stick what you need to survive in one pile, and what you want to be comfortable in another. Make sure everyone has their ""survival gear"". (For example I think a first aid kit, some water purification tabs, a glow stick, a striker (fire starter), a compass, a knife, some rope, and toilet paper are survival gear).  I would want everyone to carry that themselves. Yes, that means there 6 first aid kits. No one ever dies from too many bandages. (But again a small kit is all that's needed.)  Then look at your comfort gear. Split it up so the weight is even.  Get everyone into their pack, and have them walk around a bit and make sure they're ok with the weight and nothing is off-center.</p>

<h2>Starting out</h2>

<p>Once at the start of the trip, <strong>go over some safety info</strong>. Point out the ranger stations. Make sure everyone knows which way to walk and how to tell. Set up plans for being separated - both for the daytime and the nighttime. Go over the very basics: don't leave food about, keep your tent closed, keep clothes in your tent. Don't drink ""raw"" water. Go over what to do if someone is injured. Give everyone a map of the area you're hiking in and point out landmarks. See that big rock. That's this spot on the map. See that hill over there, here it is on the map. The river, that's this line right here. If you get lost, then you sit still and wait one hour. If no one finds you by then, you want to walk towards the river and then follow the bank to the big hill. You will either come the camp site or the ranger station.</p>

<h2>Camping</h2>

<p><strong>Picking a campsite</strong> is easy; just make sure it's by a nice big landmark. If you're in a place with assigned camp sites then even better.</p>

<p><strong>Setting up camp</strong> make sure you get your spot set up first. If you're using a tent, get it up first. Then help the others with theirs if they ask. If it starts to get dark, it may be time to take charge again, but hopefully, you're with friends and you're not being an ass, so if they need help they will ask. In line with being a leader though, you make the call. If it looks like they're headed for a bad situation help them out. Better mad then dead (or injured, or sick).</p>

<p><strong>While camping</strong> stay on top of safety issues. Even if it means being a pest. Remind everyone to keep their food and trash away for example. Specially if you're in an area with bears, cougars, etc. Make it a point to turn in early. By now everyone should be following your lead as far as ""what needs doing"" so take advantage of that and turn in early. A little extra sleep will go along way. </p>

<p><strong>Fire</strong>, if they have had no experience, then you just manage the fire. Again it can really depend on where you are, but if you're in a ""dry"" area, it doesn't take much for a bad fire pit to become a dangerous situation. Last think you want is the rangers showing up because someone got silly with the fat wood. Give lessons, show the differences, but make sure they at least check with you before adding to the fire. It takes a while to know if a log will burn for an hour or all night. If you need more heat to cook or if you just need to wait for more of the wood to burn.</p>

<h2>First aid</h2>

<p>I know it's gonna be weird, but when you stop for the night, and in the morning before you pack up, make sure to do a medical check. Most importantly, make everyone take their shoes and socks off and check for blisters or irritations. These nasty little suckers can turn a 1 mile hike into a hospital trip, and because there seem only minor, people tend to just ""tough it out"", when all they really need to do is make someone aware of it, and put on a bandage (when it's early). Same is true for rubbing of pants and pack straps (though just ask don't look). If you catch it when its ""itchy"", a little water and a bandage will take care of it. If they wait till it's bleeding and hurts to walk....</p>

<h2>Toilet</h2>

<p>It seems silly, but when setting up camp, when on site, and during your planning meeting make sure to go over it. Different parks have different rules. There not always intuitive or pleasant.</p>

<h2>HAVE FUN!!!!</h2>

<p>I know I talk a lot about you taking charge. But this trip is supposed to be fun. Keep it fun. Taking  charge doesn't mean being bossy. But it does mean taking responsibility for the situation. Make sure it's fun and not just a day of you bossing everyone around. Help when needed, interject when needed, but mostly just chill and get back to nature. </p>

","<p>I did a test run with an Instant Tent this weekend, and discovered a major flaw in the design. Because the poles are not rigid all the way through and have a hinge in the middle, under any sort of stress (either leaning against the tent or a strong wind), the pole will flex at the hinge and partially collapse the tent (or fully if more than one pole flexes). This is a complete dealbreaker for me. (I wouldn't call this a ""failure"", since the hinge didn't break, and didn't need to be repaired.)</p>

  <p>Two or three hikers had run-ins with local inhabitants, and some reported uncomfortable hitch-hiking incidents. More seriously, two hikers were threatened with guns, and there was one (not officially reported) attempted rape. [...] When one considers that we are dealing with the experiences of 136 people over three to six months, the unpleasant occurrences were relatively few. [...] When asked what they considered the major hazards on the trail about which they might wish to warn new hikers, responses boiled down to three categories [...]</p>

<p>In these responses, 23 people reported trouble due to other people (thefts, encounters with drunks, ...), 19 cited ""trail/environmental hazards,"" and 14 issues to animals.

"How can I keep my iPhone going on a multiday hike?","2668","","<p>Taking a five day hike, and I want to take a bazillion pictures.  It would be nice to have the  compass &amp; GPS functionality too, and I want something really small.  The obvious choice is my iPhone.</p>

<p>As everyone knows, however, an iPhone sucks juice like a baby waking up from a night's sleep. Even if I turn off all the radio transmitters, I just can't imagine my iPhone holding a charge for more than a day.</p>

<p>I've poked around looking at hand-crank chargers (not recommended for smart phones), and solar panels seem to have really mixed results.  I've also seen chargers that take 9-volt batteries and convert them into juice, but realistically don't know how many batteries I'd need to drain to keep my electronics going.</p>

<p>So, what is my best option for having this device last the whole hike, with no recharge?</p>
","<p>If the GPS is mostly off (i.e. you're only rarely using your GPS app), I think you will get ~2 days of battery life.  To get that much battery life, you'd need to do these things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Keep the GPS off as much as possible (i.e. use it no more that 5-6 times a day)</li>
<li>Turn it off at night completely</li>
<li>keep brightness to a minimum</li>
<li>Disable all cellular antennas (may need to jailbreak to do this)</li>
<li>remove unnecessary apps, especially anything that wants to run in the background</li>
<li>turn it off during the day as much as possible</li>
</ul>

<p>So even with all that, you're looking at 2 days.</p>

<p>What can you do beyond that?  I think the simplest solution to get you the recharge you'd need is to buy an iPhone battery case - usually this is just an external Li-ion battery that plugs into your iPhone.  These are pretty common, fairly light, and generally easy to use.  They also have the advantage of often combining in a waterproof case (so you can take pictures even if it is raining).  The limitation might be that it doesn't actually get you enough charges for what you want to do (a bazillion pictures are a lot!)</p>

<p>I agree that hand-cranks and solar chargers are not nearly reliable enough.</p>

<p>So the only other solution that I might consider is something that eats AA Li-ion disposable batteries (or if you feel environmentally friendly, the best AA rechargeables you can find) and spits out power via USB.  Tekkeon makes a couple products that might be the right kind of thing (I've used one before that worked perfectly)... You might try <a href=""http://www.tekkeon.com/products-tekcharge1580-compat.html"">this one</a>.  Li-ion AAs are very light, although expensive, and each set of 2 will charge your iPhone 1-2 times (depends on which AA charger you get and which iPhone you have... might be best to test this before you leave!).</p>

<p>I suggest you get a fire proof container like a metal coffee can, and place the ash and charcoal in the fire proof container.  Starting a fire on a bed of ash with some charcoal from the last fire, makes fire starting much easier.

"Is it possible to differentiate between a dog print and wolf print?","2635","","<p>This question got my thinking:</p>

<p><a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/11613/did-i-see-a-wolfs-pawprint"">Did I see a wolf's paw print?</a>. </p>

<p>I did a bit of Googling and it appeared that wolf paw prints and dog paw prints are very very similar. Is there any good way (given that the size of a dog and wolf can be very similar) to differentiate between them?</p>
","<p>No, there's no chance to distinguish the print of a large dog from one of a wolf. However, you can still differentiate between them, if you have a whole track. Dogs walk remarkable different than their ancestors. Compared to a wolf, a dog draws a sinuous line like it was drunk. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The best way to determine if wolves are present is to find their
  tracks. Wolf tracks are fairly easy to pick out, as they can be more
  than twice as big as a coyote’s. They can sometimes be confused with
  the tracks of large dogs, but the key is in how they walk. Whether
  it’s on a packed trail, or through deep snow, a wolf wastes very
  little energy while traveling. Their tracks are nearly always in a
  straight line, with the left and right paws only slightly offset
  (usually 6 inches or less). Compared to wolves, dogs walk like they’re
  drunk. Their tracks are distinctly scattered, and often appear more
  “wandering.” </p>
  
  <p>Also, even on hard trails, dogs tend to drag their toes
  when they walk, whereas wolves generally leave a cleaner stride. In
  deep snow, distinct tracks are rarely visible. Look for a narrow trail
  with in-line footprints. When a pack runs through deep snow, they
  usually step in the same tracks as the wolf in front of them, which
  leaves even more pronounced prints. Also, you can usually see where
  their bodies have pushed a trail through the snow. The way they travel
  often makes it tough to determine how many are in a pack.</p>

<p>The diagrams above are exaggerated but clearly show, what one should have an eye on. Thanks to David Richerby for pointing this out.   </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It can be impossible to distinguish a large dog from a wolf from a
  single track. Instead, if possible look for the pattern of the trail
  left by the animal. Dogs’ pattern of walking reflects their domestic
  lifestyle. They do not rely on stealth, and tend to walk erratically.
  Their hind foot tracks seldom register within their forefoot tracks.
  They may also approach strange objects directly. Wolves on the other
  hand, tend to walk more directly when travelling. Their trails reflect
  this, as the track of the hind foot is placed within or directly in
  front of the forefoot. Wolves will also approach strange objects
  cautiously, often circling widely to investigate rather than
  approaching directly.</p>

"How to take care of an acrophobic person while hiking?","2631","","<p>There is some trouble. One of my close friends has acrophobia (fear of heights). But he wants to go for a trek for what it offers than just the mesmerizing view from the top. How can I take care of one such person?</p>

<p>Obvious assumptions: Hike doesn't include any climbing activity, not even scrambling. </p>
","<p>I'd treat a new acrophobic hiker the same way I would any other new hiker I was out with. I start out by asking them what they are comfortable with before we even start, as well as what their fitness level is. For instance, I have a friend in poor shape with terrible balance who occasionally comes with me hiking. I choose routes with her that are much easier than I would do alone, and that mostly don't involve rock scrambling or unbridged stream crossings. But we've done a little scrambling anyway sometimes, and she's always been happy to learn she can.</p>

<p>Along the way, I check in with a new hiker, especially when we get to a situation that's likely to be a bit tricky. In this case, it might mean a rocky climb or a trail with a drop-off. With a hiker who has no specific problems, it might mean asking how they are doing on a tough, steep section, or just checking on their energy and hydration levels after an hour and taking more frequent breaks than I usually would.</p>

<p>With an acrophobic friend, I'd ask them about what sort of situation makes them most uncomfortable, then mostly avoid it. This would probably include scrambling, steep switchbacks, and cliffside trails, but it's their call. No need to avoid all heights, since they already know there will be some. The point is to give them an enjoyable experience so that they want to come back, and maybe push their limits further next time.</p>

"If I have to cross an icy, flowing river, what are some ways I can cross safely?","2621","","<p>If I'm alone in a survival situation and I have to cross a very cold river that's still flowing, how should I accomplish this safely?</p>
","<p>First off, weigh up whether it's worth crossing said river. I know this question is about if you ""have"" to cross it, but bear in mind that falling in is a real danger and if you do, hypothermia can onset very quickly and be deadly. It depends on the situation - if we're talking about a shallow, wade-able body of water that's not much more than a stream I'd be much less hesitant to give it the go-ahead than if we're talking about something 20ft deep and triple that in width! Sometimes your gut reaction can be good here, if you think it looks highly risky and you might not make it successfully, don't attempt it! And if you can't swim strongly and you're just relying on trying to balance on top of a few logs without falling in, don't even think about it.</p>

<p>If you decide you to cross it:</p>

<p><strong>Look for a bridge</strong> - No, seriously. Some people really can miss the obvious.</p>

<p><strong>Prepare</strong> - Be sure to prepare thoroughly first. Re-pack your rucksack so all the vitals you'll need are kept as dry as they can be, and accessible (you'll want things like chemical heating packs, stoves, fire fuel <em>and dry, warm clothes</em> to all be very handy when you reach the other side.)</p>

<p><strong>Find a good point to cross</strong> - As a general rule avoid deep, fast flowing water. It's better to find somewhere that might be a bit wider, but shallower and easier overall. If the river narrows at a particular point don't be fooled, the water has to have gone somewhere and unless it's branched off to another stream, it's because it's gone down - i.e. it's deeper! Wider patches are generally shallower, slower flowing and therefore a better choice even if it seems like you've got more of a task ahead of you to cross. There are also other telltale signs you can look out for - reeds for instance tend to thrive better in shallower water.</p>

<p><strong>Find a good time to cross</strong> - Leave yourself plenty of time before it gets dark - it may take longer than you think, and you don't want a lack of light providing an unnecessary complication. I'd advise crossing late morning if you can at all - that way you ensure you get plenty of light which crosses one of the list of things to worry about (and it's an easy one to cross off) and you also ensure that you get to the other side when the day, on average, should be warmest. If anyone's fallen in or got wet, you'll be glad of every little bit of heat you can get to warm you back up!</p>

<p><strong>Stay out of the water if you can</strong> - See if there are any materials around which you could use to construct a raft or similar. The best thing to avoid getting frozen solid is to stay out of the water in the first place. Equally, try and see if you could build a bridge with logs or any other suitable material.</p>

<p><strong>Rope yourself to a secure point on the bank..?</strong> - This is a contentious one. I initially recommended it because the plus side is that you won't get swept away in a current, the minus side is that it could get caught or pull you under. Judge the situation accordingly, but if you do use it, use a quick release karabiner to attach it to yourself (so you can remove it quickly and easily if you have to.)</p>

<p><strong>As soon as you're across, get the heating supplies out</strong> - It may well be that adrenaline is keeping you going and you're colder than you think. Equally even if you feel ok, the next person of your team to cross may not be. Make the most of this by getting a fire going if you can, get warm clothes out, and keep an eye out for each other to make sure everyone's ok. Have some warm soup, run around - anything to get you warmed up again!</p>

"What's the problem with burying toilet paper?","2616","","<p>In the backcountry, we should bury solid human waste (i.e. poop), and we are told to carry out toilet paper.

<p>If I bury my poop and bury (biodegradable) toilet paper along with it, what is the harm done?  The ecological impact should be small, and it is unlikely another hiker will see my toilet paper.  Then why do we need to pack it out?</p>

<p><em>Note: I am assuming areas where burying human waste is considered good practice in the first place, thus excluding areas where visitors are required to carry out solid human waste.</em></p>

<p>Burying toilet paper with your poop is acceptable in areas <strong>where it can break down and decompose</strong>. If you are in arid dirt that doesn't get much moisture, or in rocks or sand, then it is not acceptable to bury toilet paper. Paper is considered compost, but just make sure it's properly buried with your stool, and that your stool is in itself properly buried in accordance with <a href=""http://www.leavenotrace.ca/principle-dispose-waste-properly"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">leave no trace ethics</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Toilet Paper:</strong><br> Use toilet paper sparingly and use only plain, white, non-perfumed brands. Toilet paper must be disposed of properly!
  It should either be thoroughly buried in a cathole or placed in
  plastic bags and packed out. Natural toilet paper has been used by
  many campers for years. When done correctly, this method is as
  sanitary as regular toilet paper, but without the impact problems.
  Popular types of natural toilet paper include stones, vegetation and
  snow. Obviously, some experimentation is necessary to make this
  practice work for you, but it is worth a try! Burning toilet paper in
  a cathole is not generally recommended.</p>

"Why does this blue tit bird desperately want to come inside?","2596","","<p>There's a strange thing going on since a few days ago in the office. Suddenly we recognized a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_blue_tit"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">blue tit</a> flying like crazy up and down on our window. It looks quite average, a beautiful bird, not like somehow sick or something. Still, the first day we thought: ""Okay, this poor thing sure is ill."" We didn't bother anymore since we thought it's going to die soon. </p>

<p>The next day however, the blue tit flew a few charges again. Always flying to the window just to go up and down on it then. This lasts for about 5 minutes before the bird moves away again. </p>

<p>The behavior is shown frequently for about the last 5 days. Approximately the tit comes every 5 hours trying to storm our window. This doesn't mean, that it's always exactly 5 hours. Sometimes it's only there once per office-day and sometimes it comes back after an hour. </p>

<p>I've never seen something like this. What's wrong with it? What causes this behavior? </p>

<li><p>There's something it thinks is food on the inside.

<li><p>At this time of year, more likely, it's not trying to get in, but sees its reflection as a rival or (as the sexes look alike in blue tits) a potential mate. Winter tit flocks break up in spring and pairs form. This is common is in some species - (European) robin for example, and has been seen in blue tits as well. The time of day at which this occurs may be affected by light levels, which change the brightness of the reflection, also by indoor lighting. You may be able to prove it by placing a mirror in a similar area. </p></li>

If not can anyone suggest me a another time efficient way of climbing a multi-pitch route with 3 people in a team?</p>

<p>Equipment that I have includes ATC, 2 Ropes, 20-Quick Draws (sport route), slings and cordelette. </p>
","<p>Simple answer is the same way you would belay one climber. The two should climb simultaneously with the second tied in to a loop (Alpine Butterfly) about 5-10 meters above the third.  If the difficulty is such the a fall is more than a remote possibility for either of the following climbers, or simultaneous climbing maintaining same separation is too difficult, they should not be belayed together and should climb separately.  Simultaneous climbing is not for everyone, it adds difficultly and requires constant communication. Recovery from a fall is often a lot more difficult.    </p>

<p>By trying to jury rig a special case for a relatively (I hope) rarely used scenario, you are creating plenty opportunities for incorrect rigging. The rope management problems that could come from two climbers moving at different rates at different times, along with the need to lock off of the correct strand all make it what I would consider and unsafe set up  (However, I personally believe any auto-locking set up unreliable and should only be used as a last resort or backup, never relied on as the primary safety measure) </p>

","<p>Top roping over sharp edges is never recommended, but if you insist that's what you want to do then what you want is an edge roller:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pahYe.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pahYe.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>You can anchor it to the top bolts and hang it right over the edge using accessory cord so that the ropes slide over the rollers instead of the sharp edge:</p>

<p>The picture does't show it, but you're supposed to use velcro straps or something else as a safety to prevent the rope from jumping the track.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>If you're concerned about your edge protector flipping over, they do make Roll modules for moving ropes that have both vertical and horizontal rollers:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KQzkY.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KQzkY.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>There are a lot of different styles of edge protectors and edge rollers, but you can typically find them or order them at rescue supply stores. </p>

<p>A slightly more affordable option is a rope pad:</p>

<p>Same idea as the rollers, but made out of heavy duty material instead of metal, and you run the ropes trough a sleeve.</p>

<hr>

<p>You asked specifically for climbing with dynamic ropes, but I figured I's show the cheap and easy method for single rope rappels too:</p>

<p>I use a <a href=""http://www.mec.ca/product/5007-459/spirol-rope-protector/?q=rope%2Bprotector"" rel=""noreferrer"">Spirol Rope Protector</a> and I really like it, it's flexible but very durable rubber, and it wraps around your rope.</p>

<p>A couple things I like about are that you can leave it on your rope when it's coiled, and you can make it slide along the rope, which is handy if you need to rappel with it a ways to get down to whatever sharp edge you're going over. It doesn't slide on it's own very easily, but it's got a small hole in it so you can tie a rat tail stopper or something with some small cord just in case. But once you've got it pinned against the rock it doesn't move. Another perk is that it stays with your rope, so if you need to swing or traverse you don't have to worry about your rope coming off of you edge protector.</p>

<p>The danger of capsizing your raft generally starts with a class 3 and gets progressively greater.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Its actually a quite extensive article and worth a read for anyone wanting more information on terminology commonly used in rafting.</p>

<p>Obviously after heavy rains, the flow of the river will be greater and the classification will generally increase. Spring and early summer tend to be a time where mountain/valley rivers are at their strongest due to melting snow and ice from higher elevations.</p>

<p>Before I ever go Kayaking, I always call a local guide and ask how the flow is.</p>

"Legality of ""semi-permanent"" wooden structures in state and national forests in the US","2569","","<p>Imagine the following situation:</p>

<p>A group of friends found a remote spot in a state or national forest that they really like.  They keep returning to the place quite often, lately there are at least some members of the group staying overnight at the spot at least once or twice a month.  They established a fire ring, surrounded by rocks, and someone dragged few logs around the fire to sit on.  They have a rope strung in the trees to hand their food from. </p>

<p>Now some of them have an idea that it would be nice to build few camp benches instead of the logs, and perhaps some primitive wooden shelter.  It is clear that there is some sort of limit, they clearly cannot go and build a large log cabin there.  There must be some sort of limit between few logs around a circle of rocks for fireplace and a cabin.  I am wondering what would still be considered OK, and where one would cross the limit.</p>
","<p>I will suggest that the legality doesn't even matter. Since other people come to the site between visits from these friends, any one of those ""other people"" could decide the site was ""too civilized"" and undo what's been done. I have found picnic tables, stone furniture and the like at campsites in provincial parks, and left it how I found it. But I can easily imagine someone dismantling a structure because they disapprove of it. </p>

<p>The best approach would be to keep everything low key - not likely to be spotted from the water or the trail, and thus not likely to offend any other visitor, whether a ranger or a member of the public. Focus on things that are useful, like log seats and fire rings, and avoid things that look like ""marking your territory"" or creating a sense of possession. I think a shelter of any kind is definitely over the line. I'm not talking about the law, but about how other campers will feel when they reach the site. A log and a fire ring: ooh, this is nice. A rope left strung between two trees at perfect tarp height: this is handy. A plywood roof supported by 2x4s connected to trees: what's going on here?</p>

"Will the benefit of an axe outweigh the drawbacks and win over a large knife?","2566","","<p>I've hiked some in my life, and gotten used to carrying a small axe for chopping wood for the fire.

<p>So my pickle is, now that my axe is left in the dust by a more versatile tool(?), would it make sense to completly remove it from my pack list? Or are there more benefits to a small axe that I can't see?</p>

<p>Perhaps it is better to carry a small axe and a normal-sized fixed-blade knife instead of the pretty large bowie knife? </p>
","<p>I have never taken an axe or hatchet camping with me, and I canoe-camp and car camp where space and weight are far less an issue than they are for hikers. In addition to weight and space there is the safety issue using a heavy tool that you swing hard.</p>

"What type of mosquito repellent is most effective?","2559","","<p>There are many different kinds of insect repellents and bug sprays on the market: sprays and lotions, chemical and natural, huge percentages of DEET and lower percentages, etc.</p>

<p>What type of bug repellent is most effective against mosquitoes? What types should be avoided or are just a marketing ploy?</p>

<p>I'm not asking for specific product recommendations, but general advice about types of insect repellent (e.g. 100% DEET vs. 30% vs. citronella oil, etc.).</p>
","<p>Mosquitoes love me, so I've had opportunity to try many variations of repellent.  Most of the things you mentioned are effective immediately after application.  For me, the difference is how effective they are after hours of sweaty hiking.  For that, I lean towards high percentage DEET in a lotion-type formulation like <a href=""http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/Ultrathon/Products/Products/Personal-Insect-Repellant/"">3M Ultrathon</a> (that particular one is 35% DEET).</p>

<p>For the parts of you that are covered by clothing, I have had success with permethrin treatments, but I prefer just wearing clothes that mosquitos can't bite through (I don't know how to find this out without field testing).</p>

<p>DEET is supported by several studies</p>

<p><a href=""http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/Ultrathon/Products/Products/Personal-Insect-Repellant/"">Annals of Internal Medicine</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET) is the most effective, and best
  studied, insect repellent currently on the market.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Of the active ingredients registered with the EPA, CDC believes that
  two have demonstrated a higher degree of efficacy in the
  peer-reviewed, scientific literature (See Publications page.).
  Products containing these active ingredients typically provide
  longer-lasting protection than others:</p>
  
  <p>DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide)<br>
  Picaridin (KBR 3023)</p>

<p>Also make sure you apply sunscreen first.</p>

<p>Animal scat in the wild is important in identifying and tracking particular wild animals.</p>

  <p><strong>Using scats to identify animals</strong></p>
  
  <p>All animals leave scats, whether it's a native animal such as a possum, or a feral fox or cat. Snakes, birds, lizards, even insects - if you start looking for them you'll find scats everywhere.</p>
  
  <p>Becoming familiar with animals scats is the only way to learn to distinguish them, according to National Parks and Wildlife NSW officer Dan Lunney.</p>
  
  <p>""It's very hard to be a scat expert. The common thing is that you get very good at identifying the scats of one particular animal,"" he said.</p>
  
  <p>Once you've gained a familiarity with them, scats are a valuable way of finding out what kind of animals are around you and where they live. Below are a few simple tips to get you started at looking at scats. It can be a tricky business, and a good guide is useful. It's important to find out what sort of animals are around in your area so you know what you are looking for. - <a href=""http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2007/09/26/2044094.htm"">What scat is that?</a></p>

As pointed out below though if you have crampons then <strong>don't ever</strong> dig those into the surface at all - you'll only injure yourself! If that's the case, just use your hands and knees.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tnyVW.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>You <em>could</em> just tie the knife on, but there is a high chance of it slipping, especially if the stick you're using is smooth (like Bamboo) and the knife doesn't have a lanyard hole to secure the binding in place.</p>

<p>Assuming you're using a flint knife, you could attach it <a href=""http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=Gmq0CTbiajYC&amp;pg=PA153&amp;lpg=PA153&amp;dq=survival+how+to+attach+a+flint+spear+head&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SpXKO3xPUp&amp;sig=pDv9ZTvsriSkARymyfn44sxRSiA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tusRU7KhG4ygigf9qIC4BA&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=survival%20how%20to%20attach%20a%20flint%20spear%20head&amp;f=false"">this way</a>. After tying it together, you could glue the binding using pine pitch or a similar adhesive.</p>

<p>Personally, I'd go with making a spear because that allows the knife to be used as a backup weapon and prevents it from getting damagedd. This guide <a href=""http://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Spear"">by Wikihow</a> covers nearly all the different survival spear types that I know of. If you intend to fish with your spears, you might find <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwbFrkKQJt4"">this guide on the Hawaiian Fishing Spear</a> helpful. </p>

<p>Knives defined as daggers or dirks, must be open-carried and cannot be concealed but there does not seem to be any state wide law restricting size.

<p>Bar-headed geese are monogamous throughout a breeding season, and generally gather in colonies of up to 1,000 pairs. </p>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.wildfowl-photography.co.uk/wildfowl/bar-headed-goose.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">source page</a> of the above information has a number of pictures, a recording of their vocalizations, and a video of the geese in action. </p>

<p>This is a very unique goose. In fact, according to a fascinating study reported in <a href=""http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/06/110610-highest-flying-birds-geese-himalaya-mountains-animals/"" rel=""noreferrer"">National Geographic</a>, it's the highest flying bird found. On their migration from India to Mongolia for breeding, they have to fly over the Himalaya mountain range, which is the tallest mountain range in the world.</p>

<p>In 2009, an international team of researchers tagged 25 bar-headed geese in India with GPS transmitters in order to monitor their two-month migration. They reached a peak height of nearly 21,120 feet (6,437 meters), and covered a distance up to 5,000 miles (8,000 kilometers)!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The birds made frequent rest stops during the migration, but they appear to have flown over the Himalayan portion of their journey in a single effort that took about eight hours on average and that included little or no rest. A similar intense climb could kill a human without proper acclimatization, Hawkes said.</p>

<p>Here are some more fun facts:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li><p>Bar-headed geese are hardy birds! They are capable of flying through the passes of the highest mountains with winds that blow at speeds of more than 200 mph and temperatures low enough to freeze exposed flesh instantly. At this height, oxygen levels drop by one-third; even kerosene cannot burn there and helicopters cannot fly there.</p></li>
  <li><p>Their powerful and constant flight helps generate body heat, which is retained by their down feathers. Such heat helps keep ice from building up on their wings when flying over mountains.</p></li>
  <li><p>These geese also have a special type of hemoglobin that absorbs oxygen quicker than other birds; they can also extract more oxygen from each breath than other birds can.</p></li>
  <li><p>These geese are able to migrate - more than 1,000 miles - in a single day.</p></li>
  <li><p>Scientists believe the geese's yearly migration is triggered by an environmental signal that allows them to miss the summer monsoon season and the worst winter storms.</p></li>
  <li><p>These geese rely on flapping their wings - not on gliding - and are able to fly over 50 miles an hour without wind to assist them. In fact, they are so strong that they are able to fly in crosswinds without being blown off course.</p></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, not only are these geese an integral part of the ecosystem, but they are also important to science. Researchers believe that with better data about the bar-headed geese's resistance to extreme temperatures, they could help humans better cope with altitude and respiratory diseases.

"Preventing hand blisters while paddling","2477","","<p>I went kayaking for the first time this weekend, and it was a blast! Unfortunately, I also ended up with some abraded skin on my hands, where the paddle shaft had chaffed the skin. I've done other paddle sports before, and while my hands would often develop callouses over time in specific areas, I never experienced discomfort/blisters like this. </p>

<p>What are some good ways to avoid this? Just get over it and wait for callouses to form if I kayak more often? Are there gloves that help reduce the friction? Maybe some kind of wrap on the shaft, similar to bar type on bike handlebars?</p>
","<p>Kayak guide here...</p>

<p>Blisters form because of friction, as many know. What most don't realize is that it matters little if your hands are wet or dry. Because you are gripping the paddle tightly, your hands will rub against the paddle plastic.  </p>

<p>Depending on how you are holding it, you want to minimize the ""sliding"", try to keep your hands on the same place on the kayak paddle - don't move them up and down the paddle shaft as some do. I usually open/close (flex) my ""highest"" hand when I am paddling (i.e. my lower hand is down by the water, pulling me forward, and the other hand is higher up the paddle, keep it in line). The biggest place for a blister is the inside edge of your thumb, between your thumb and first finger, so move your thumb around as you paddle to different positions; your thumb doesn't always have to wrap around the paddle.</p>

<p>I still developed small callouses, but little by way of blisters. Never used gloves personally - I would only recommend them for part-time paddlers (3-5 times/year - any more than that, start working on callouses, it is worth it for longer paddles) as it really reduces friction and makes beginners more comfortable. You may want gloves if you're doing much whitewater/rougher water (rapids, lots of rocks) since you may be trying to push off rocks/trees, etc., but the focus should always be on your paddle and using it properly). </p>

","<p>I started with a buddy of mine.  So he had most of the gear that was needed.  I just needed to buy a gun, do hunter safety, waiters and some camo.</p>

<p>Now if you're not in a situation where you have someone who already hunts you might need to do a fair amount of local research.  The basics you will need are what I had to buy a gun, waiters, and some camo.  With the waiters you will not need a dog right out of the gate.  My buddy and I still don't even use a dog.</p>

<p>The next big problem is where to hunt.  This you will have to figure out locally.  Where I live we go to public land that requires that you have a boat to get to a good spot.  If you have private land you can scout it out for where you see ducks and then you could setup there.  You also might be able to find public land that you could park your car and walk to.</p>

<p>With decoys we started with buying a 12 pack of whatever ducks you have locally.  Early season we tend to use less decoys because the duck travel in smaller groups and then increase as the season goes on.  So later we bought another 12 pack of mallards which are the late season bird here.</p>

<p>The best resource I found while starting is the <a href=""http://www.ducks.org"">Ducks Unlimited</a> website.  They have a good amount of resources on decoys, calls, guns, and just about anything you will need.</p>

"Which is better, a single fisherman's knot or a double?","2449","","<p>I ask this question based on the fact that tensile strength tests show that putting a double fisherman's knot in kernmantle rope makes it more likely for the rope to snap than a rope tied with a single fisherman's.</p>

<p>Knots weaken kernmantle rope, <em>a lot</em> in fact. Polymeric fibres are extremely strong along their <em>longitudinal</em> axis, however they have low flexural strength, meaning they are <strong>not</strong> strong along their <em>horizontal</em> axis, which is why ropes lose significant amounts of strength when tied<sup>[<a href=""http://www.sterlingrope.com/media/document/techmanual.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1</a>]</sup>. Knots create a stress concentration on a rope's horizontal axis, crushing the rope's core and causing it to fail under less force or weight than an unknotted rope. The tying of a double fisherman's knot will cause a measurable reduction (20-35%) in the tensile strength of a rope<sup>[<a href=""http://www.amazon.ca/Outdoor-Knots-Book-Clyde-Soles/dp/0898869625"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2</a>]</sup>. Moreso than a single fisherman's knot (15-20%)<sup>[<a href=""http://books.google.ca/books?id=O_SNr4LPdUQC&amp;source=gbs_similarbooks"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">3</a>]</sup>. The <em>only</em> real advantage that a double fisherman's has over a single is that it is less likely to slip, especially on newer synthetic fibre ropes, which is why it has mostly replaced the single in mountaineering. </p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>Single Fisherman's</h2>
  
  <p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AHa2z.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AHa2z.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></a><br>
  <strong>PROS:</strong> Lower reduction in tensile breaking strength of Kernmantle rope (15-20%), easier to tie, easier to untie.<br/><strong>CONS:</strong> More likely to
  slip.</p>
  
  <h2>Double Fisherman's</h2>

  <strong>PROS:</strong> Less likely to slip.<br/><strong>CONS:</strong> Greater reduction in tensile breaking strength of Kernmantle rope (20-35%), more
  complicated to tie, hard to untie.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's fair to note that a double fisherman's knot still reduces the tensile strength <em>less</em> than most other knots, and that a knot isn't really useful if it slips, but with certain types of rope it's unlikely that even a single fisherman's will slip, whereas on fancy lightweight ropes–like aramid ropes–a <em>triple</em> fisherman's is necessary to prevent your rope from slipping.</p>

<p><strong>If the rope or accessory cord that you are using will hold a single fisherman's knot without slipping, would it be better to use a single fisherman's knot (leaving really long tails) and take advantage of the higher tensile strength the knot provides over a double?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the rope or accessory cord that you are using will hold a single
  fisherman's knot without slipping, would it be better to use a single
  fisherman's knot (leaving really long tails) and take advantage of the
  higher tensile strength the knot provides over a double?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Answer: <strong>Yes</strong>, hands down. If there isn't any reason to weaken the rope further, why would you..</p>

<p>That said, (and this is the really important part), are you sure it won't slip? 100% sure? If it's your lifeline you better be 100% sure.</p>

<p>A number of pull tests have been done on this topic, many of which have been documented in the Textile Industry Journal for reference. In short though: expected outcomes can't be predicted across the board because of the different ways kernmantle ropes can be woven and twisted together.</p>

<p>Basically, your fisherman's knot is going to slip in one of two ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>The knot(s) will stay in place, but one of the ends (the yarns) will pull through.</li>
<li>The knot(s) configuration will change under tension, slipping over the other side and inverting.</li>
</ol>

<p>Normal tests for these scenario's involve rapidly loading a rope, and in those test cases the first slippage scenario is somewhat rare (provided somebody left a sufficient enough tail, up-to a few feet in some cases). You can mostly expect failures to occur in this situation when the core is already damaged - a quick inspection should be enough to rule that out though.</p>

<p>The second case also happens when rapidly loading the rope, and is the cause of failure in tests more often than the first. Unfortuantely, there aren't definitive ways to rule it out as a possibility, and no UIAA standards on slippage when rope is tied in this configuration exist, which leads me to my next answer for the same question.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>would it be better to use a single fisherman's knot..?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Answer: <strong>No</strong>, not very likely anyway. Not knowing how much force you need to put into the rope before it will start to slip or unwind is enough to deter me from using the single fisherman's.</p>

<p>Yes, it does weaken the rope or cord by a certain amount more, but usually even skinny accessory cord is used in a capacity in which it's total tensile strength far exceeds what we are expecting it to load it with.</p>

<p>Remember also, if you are joining the same rope or cord to itself, (most common application for this knot), and then loading it, chances are the force is mostly distributed between the two stands, which gives you a higher tensile strength maximum to work with.</p>

"How to detect a crevasse on a glacier","2445","","<p>When you're walking in a roped party over a glacier, how can the leader detect crevasses?</p>

<p>Sometimes it's possible to walk existing tracks, but even then it's possible to have a  crevasse fall. </p>

<p>What are good ways to find a save path on a glacier?
Some mountain guides use wood sticks with an iron tip to try to detect crevasses. How deep do I have to stick with my ice-tool?</p>
","<p>If the glacier isn't snowless (aper) you can probe for spaces under the surface which should be noticed by less resistance in the snow/Firn. Still it is preferable to <strong>avoid going in regions where one would expect crevasses</strong>. This isn't easy like it is tough to know how the weather is going to evolve in the mountains. But still we could try to use some theory to spot possibly dangerous areas.</p>

<p>Glaciers are moving, they are literally flowing. Crevasse are a result when this flow is getting influenced/restricted by e.g. elevation through rocks under the ice, different slopes or merging of different glacier flows. So it's all about the different flow velocity of the ice. This is similar to fluids. Being in your dinghy on a rock-loaded river, even when you can't see those rocks they will cause you some issues. Glacier ice is more or less solid and can only deform to a certain point, then it breaks and we are getting those inhospitable yet beautiful - this summer I was let off into one, it was impressive - crevasses.</p>

<p>There are mainly four types of crevasses:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>transverse</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><code>A crevasse oriented more or less perpendicular to the long axis of a glacier. Transverse crevasses typically open on a valley glacier when the terrain becomes steeper, such as above an icefall.</code></p>

From my anecdotal experience this also seems to be a fairly popular choice - I'd guess that easily 25% of fixed bladed knifes in local shops/stores have such a handle (I live in Switzerland).</p>

<p>Personally I always disliked these kind of handles: if I spend some 100-300+ $ for a good knife I'd like to get a quality product, and for me this includes the handle. Why would I want a handle consisting of just a piece of string?</p>

<ul>
<li>A nice wooden or synthetic/carbon/etc. handle provides way better grip in my opinion, also it can't soak up water, and it's just over all a lot sturdier.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why are paracord handles so popular? What is the idea behind it?</strong></p>

<p>I get that you could unravel the paracord in an emergency, but let's be honest: a couple of foot length of paracord are not gonna decide over whether you live or die. And would it really be worth making your knife awkward and uncomfortable to handle just to get a piece of string?</p>
","<p>Upsides </p>

<ul>
<li>It ""looks cool"" (to some)</li>
<li>Cordage (but arguably useless as you have noted)</li>
</ul>

<p>Downsides</p>

<ul>
<li>Poor grip (compared to leather and manufactured alternatives)</li>
<li>More likely to cause blisters</li>
<li>Less durable, requires more maintenance</li>
<li>PITA to clean if it gets messy/dirty/sweaty</li>
<li>Once you unwrap the cord to use it, your knife has even worse grip.</li>
</ul>

<p>IMO - It's a marketing gimmick and nothing more.  </p>

"What are other possible make-shift alternatives for chalk powder?","2435","","<p>Climber's life rely heavily on equipment. Having <em>all</em> the necessary equipment for simplest of climbs is a must. But, if at all I forget to bring the chalk powder along, what other alternatives I have for that? </p>

<p>I have used dry leaves by crushing them and rubbing them on fingers, that worked good enough. </p>

<p>What are other things that I can try?</p>
","<p>A few years back at my University climbing gym, someone posted a study performed on chalking your hands while climbing. Basically, it was discovered that there was actually a measurable decrease in the coefficient of friction when you used chalk. As in, chalk made climbing holds harder to hang onto.</p>

<p>This of course made all the climbers who read the abstract laugh, because every climber knows that chalk helps you hang on to slippery holds. But after reading the study I was actually convinced. Chalk will soak up all your sweat and grime and dry your hands, but clean dry hands are actually gripper than chalked hands. In fact, according to this study, even <em>wet</em> clean hands have a stronger coefficient of friction than chalked hands. <em>The conclusion of the study was that climbers would be better off using <strong>plain water</strong> instead of chalk.</em></p>

<p>It's the oils produced by your skin that makes rock holds slippery, and water naturally displaces oil, whereas chalking you hands puts a fine powder between you and the hold. </p>

<p>Whether or not you have chalk, the science says you're better off washing your hand in water. I've yet to try it (mostly because the rock I climb is so dirty I don't even need chalk) but you could try climbing with a wet sponge in your chalk bag and a golf towel hanging off your harness to wash and dry your hands with when they get grimy. </p>

<p>It was early evening and I was walking our dogs near <a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/FbkP6jnUJ6w"" rel=""nofollow"">Pendinas reservoir</a> in north Wales, UK. I saw a couple of buzzards (common buzzards, <em>Buteo buteo</em>) hovering on the horizon above some trees. I was watching the buzzards when I noticed a third larger bird. Wing span easily half the width of the buzzards again, so roughly 1 1/2 times larger than the buzzards. </p>

<p>I observed all three birds for some time through binoculars. They were quite some distance away though, so I couldn't quite get a really clear view. </p>

<p>At first I thought it was simply another (larger) buzzard but its wings seemed different; rather then the splayed finger wing tips of the other two birds, its wings seemed much longer and distinctly more pointed and downwards pointing at the tips.</p>

<p>It roosted in a tree on the other side of the lake. It was very distinctively a Raptor (which ruled out my other thought of some kind of sea bird). Again, I viewed it through my binoculars. It appeared dark brown and had a distinctive white patch on its chest. Again, quite some distance so hard to get a really clear view.</p>

<p>I went home and checked my bird book. The only bird I could find that matched the description of the size and the distinctive wing pattern was an Osprey. There are half a dozen nesting pairs further up the coast from me but they are not common by any stretch.</p>

<p>Based on my description do you think I could I have confused this bird with another? Or does the Osprey seem the most likely?</p>
","<p>The osprey does seem the most likely option. There are only a handful of breeding pairs in North Wales, but they are in your area so it's credible.</p>

<p>The wingspan of a small common buzzard starts at around 110cm and a large osprey can reach 170cm, so although they are normally of similar size the wingspan differential is possible. And the osprey has the white chest and narrower wing tip.</p>

<p>Here are comparisons in flight and in silhouette:</p>

<p>There's nothing else in your area of the right size and shape. So it does sound as though the osprey is your best bet. For more confidence, you could contact local bird watchers or conservationists/rangers. In my experience, they know pretty much everything that moves on their patch...</p>

"Climbing Kilimanjaro for a newbie","2422","","<p>It looks like I'm going to be living in Nairobi for a few years. Along with all of the other amazing opportunities for adventure around here, there's this giant mountain just over the border. Since I'm so close, I've started thinking about whether I could/should attempt the climb, and what I would need to do to prepare.</p>

<p>Given that most of my hiking experience has been day hiking in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, how would I begin to prepare myself for a trek of this magnitude? I've never really done any backpacking or multi day hikes, so I'm mostly starting from scratch. Where do I begin?</p>

<p>Like I said, I'll be here for a few years, so I've got lots of time to prepare. I don't want to go rushing into it willy-nilly. I guess I'm just looking for advice on how to get started with something like this.</p>
","<p>According to regulations in Tanzania, you can't climb Kilimanjaro without a guide.</p>

<p>That means you will 100% be with somebody that understands the nature of acclimatization and has likely been up many many times previously.</p>

<p>When you hire a guide, or book a guided trip via a company, they will also take care of permits for you. Most companies automatically factor in the cost of porters also, whom will transport all food and equipment required for your time on the mountain.</p>

<p>With your accommodation and food covered, and a porter carrying your extra clothes and gear, the only thing left to do is hike! It sounds like you already have a good base to build on, so I would suggest working on your stamina like others suggested. Ideally you should mimic the conditions by doing multiple days of long day hikes, 4-8 hours a day is adequate. </p>

<p>Overnight trips are good too, since it will get you used to sleeping outdoors, but I'd rather you think of Kilimanjaro as a multiple long day trips over the course of a week. Some of the routes involve staying in wooden lodges with running water and really negate the need to feel comfortable in a tent.</p>

<p><strong>Kilimanjaro is a very very popular mountain, and I think anyone in reasonable fitness is likely to reach the top with adequate support.</strong> Remember: If you aren't feeling up for walking 8 hours a day, just have your guide factor in addition days on the mountain, this will give you the ability to acclimatize properly, and reach the summit without your muscles being in total agony. I saw Martin and Esther Kafer hobbling around Vancouver last year. They are in their 80's, <a href=""http://www.climbmountkilimanjaro.com/about-the-mountain/record-climbs/"">and currently the oldest people known to have reached the summit</a>. If they can do it, so can you!</p>

"Why is it unsafe to handle metallic equipment with bare hand at higher altitude?","2412","","<p>I have seen a few documentaries where the high altitude mountaineers constantly keep the hand-gloves ON.<br>
Is it really because handling the metallic equipment with bare hands can cause a Frostbite?
What else risk is there?</p>

<p>What temperature ranges are permissible at which I can afford to handle metallic equipment bare-handed?
Its really difficult for someone like me who has never been very comfortable with any sort of gloves, handling life-banking metallic equipment there at the mountain will need a practice of course.</p>
","<p>The conductive property of the material is a critical part of this phenomenon.</p>

<p>It would be safe to handle many plastics at very low temperatures because energy from your hand (and the moisture on it) isn't readily conducted away, and the energy that is, takes a while to dissipate into the rest of the material so the point of contact retains the transferred energy longer. That is all to say: plastic can be a good insulator.</p>

<p>Metal on the other hand is a fantastic conductor of heat. It will immediately draw the heat away from your hand (and moisture between metal and hand), freezing moisture and cold-burning your hand. Unlike the plastic the heat from contact will quickly dissipate into the rest of the metal (that you're not touching) which keeps the contact point cold.</p>

<p>You can very easily test this by sticking a plastic handled knife or fork in the freezer for a few hours. The plastic will not feel anywhere near as cold as the metal because it won't readily conduct heat away.</p>

<p>The ""limit"" for handling metallic equipment is really fine. Seriously, you can get stuck to a big object at just a few degrees under 0°C.</p>

"Why might one need a 2000 lumen headlamp?","2405","","<p>I was just looking at a product my friend was bragging about, a headlamp with 2000 lumen intensity.

<p>I usually trek in jungles and forests and so seldom like (from now on I plan to) once in an year in Himalayas.</p>

<p>A flashlight with 2000 lm capacity is what I can understand as a product, but a headlamp?</p>

<p>Here is a picture of the product my friend referred to:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/cEoEo.jpg"" alt=""headlamp""></p>
","<p>Other answers have addressed the ""why"", but let's talk about the ""what's real"" regarding lumens. </p>

<p>Before we get into calculation the actual output of this light (which is definitely nowhere near 2000 lumens), we need to understand what lumens are. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumen_(unit)"">Lumens</a> is the SI unit for luminous flux, which is essentially the total amount of light in the visible spectrum emitted by a source in all directions. Lumens does <em>not</em> depend on distance from the light source, because it must be measured in all directions. A related unit, lux, measures light at a point, and <em>is</em> dependent on distance. 1&nbsp;lux = 1&nbsp;lm/m<sup>2</sup>. If you were to measure the lux at every point on an imaginary sphere around a light source, add them up, and multiply by the surface area of that sphere, you would get the total lumens output of the device. No matter what the diameter of the sphere, you would get the same number of lumens. As you increase the diameter, the lux measured at each point decreases, but the surface area and number of points you must measure at increase. </p>

<p>It turns out this is almost exactly how you measure lumens in real life - with a scientific instrument called an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrating_sphere"">integrating sphere</a>. An integrating sphere uses a highly diffuse coating to evenly disperse light inside a sphere. All light entering through the sample port bounces around so many times that the brightness is nearly even at any point on the surface of the sphere. A photodetector, typically a radiometer, measures the intensity of the light received at the exit port across all visible wavelengths, then sums the intensities to determine the total luminous flux. Below is a photo of the integrating sphere I used to conduct testing of bike lights: </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MJqAP.jpg"" alt=""Integrating sphere""></p>

<p>The <a href=""http://webstore.ansi.org/RecordDetail.aspx?sku=ANSI%2FNEMA%20FL%201-2009"">ANSI FL1 Standard</a> specifies measurement procedures and reporting criteria for measuring the output (lumens), beam distance (calculated from lux), battery life, and other properties of flashlights, headlamps, bike lights, and other personal lighting equipment. This provides a repeatable, verifiable, and trustworthy way for lighting manufacturers to report device specifications. Most reputable personal lighting manufacturers follow this standard, but random generic manufacturers - like those selling the light mentioned in the question - do not. These generic sellers tend to drastically overstate and even outright lie about specifications, claiming insanely high lumen values with no data to back them up.</p>

<hr>

<p>So, now let's prove why this light doesn't put out 2000 lumens. </p>

<p>It appears this light uses two 18650 batteries. The <a href=""http://industrial.panasonic.com/lecs/www-data/pdf2/ACI4000/ACI4000CE17.pdf"">Panasonic NCR18650</a> <sup>PDF</sup> is one of the most common 18650 lithium battery cells, and is the cell used inside of many repackaged batteries sold by flashlight companies and inside many devices with integrated batteries. Its rated capacity is 2700 mAh and the nominal voltage is 3.6 V. For two batteries, that gives <strong><a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2.7%20Amp-hour%20*%203.6%20V"">9.7 Watt-hours</a></strong>. </p>

<p>Let's look at the <a href=""http://www.cree.com/led-components-and-modules/products/xlamp/discrete-directional/xlamp-xml"">Cree XM-L T6</a> emitter, the LED specified for the product you mentioned. Cree's <a href=""http://www.cree.com/~/media/Files/Cree/LED%20Components%20and%20Modules/XLamp/Data%20and%20Binning/XLampXML.pdf"">Data Sheet</a> <sup>PDF</sup> gives luminous flux (lumens) data for up to 2000 mA current draw. The maximum forward current for this LED is 3000 mA. At 3000 mA the forward bias is 3.35 V, so the light would draw just about 10 W. With the batteries mentioned above, the light would last just under 1 hour, if we ignore the power consumed by the control electronics and any efficiency losses. </p>

<p>How much light does the LED put out at 3000 mA? I plotted the luminous flux vs. current draw for the light, and fit a linear function to the data: </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/i9sfF.png"" alt=""Cree XM-L T6 LED current vs flux""></p>

<p>At 3000 mA current, the maximum current for this emitter, the extrapolated luminous flux is 1000 lumens. To achieve 2000 lumens, the LED would require over 6000 mA, more than twice the maximum for this emitter. Keep in mind that the lumen values here are calculated estimates based on the emitter's specifications. They don't take into account losses due to reflector design and lens material. LEDs also drop in output when they get hot, and most cheap lights have poor temperature management. </p>

<p>I run a bike light testing and review site called <a href=""http://www.bikelightdatabase.com/"">The Bike Light Database</a>, and I've tested similar generic headlights like this one. I measured a nearly identical light with a Cree XM-L T6 emitter and the actual output was 600 lumens, half of its claimed 1200 lumens and less than a third of this headlamp's claimed 2000. </p>

<p>So, to answer your question rather long-windedly, why a 2000 lumen headlamp? Well, it's simply <em>not</em> a 2000 lumen headlamp.</p>

<p>Any info that helps me understand how all this works and what I should look for is much appreciated. Cheers.</p>
","<p>I searched deep into the ""interwebs"" and this is the best answer I could get. It's from <a href=""http://www.uer.ca/forum_showthread.asp?fid=1&amp;threadid=5175"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">UER</a>, one of the biggest online urbex communities.</p>

<h2>Differences between respirators</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Respirators are masks that use filters to clean the air before it is breathed.</p>
  
  <p>Don't confuse respirators with standard dust masks, the kind that looks like bra cups. True respirators have a rubber boot to form a good seal with your face and check valves to positively isolate exhale and inhale path.</p>
  
  <p>Respirators with P100 rated particulate filters are recommended if you're going to a location that contains a significant amount of nuisance dust, rat urine laced dust, aerosols or asbestos. P100 filters hold indefinitely and you can use them until they get dirty, wet, or becomes noticeably harder to breath in. Since N95 is ineffective against asbestos, you should insist on P100.</p>
  
  <p>If your location contains organic vapors,acid gases, mercury vapor among other things, you need some activated carbon cartridges designed for the type of contaminant. Since it's uneconomical to stock on each type, I would get a set of Multi-vapor/Multi gas type. THESE HAVE A VERY LIMITED LIFE ONCE OPENED. They have expiration dates and once opened, they should be stored in sealed bags, like ZipLoc. After a few months, they should be considered ineffective. Higher the contaminant exposure, the sooner the cartridges will saturate. Read the enclosed manual. If you think you spent the useful life, throw them out and consider these one or two time use items.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>NIOSH rating</h2>

<p>This information was what I was looking for and helps me understand what mask to use in each situation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Filters are given a NIOSH rating based on two factors: their effectiveness against oil-based hazards, and their efficiency. The rating consists of a letter followed by a number. These break down as follows:</p>
  
  <p>""N-"" - Not resistant to oils.</p>
  
  <p>""R-"" - Resistant to oils.</p>
  
  <p>""P-"" - oil-Proof.</p>
  
  <p>""-95"" - Able to filter out 95% of dangerous substances.</p>
  
  <p>""-99"" - Able to filter out 99% of dangerous substances.</p>
  
  <p>""-100"" - Able to filter out 99.97% of dangerous substances.</p>
  
  <p>Therefore, N95 filters provide the least protection among the NIOSH-approved respirators, and P100 filters provide the greatest protection.</p>
  
  <p>It is of paramount importance that you know the capabilities and limitations of your respirator. No respirator creates oxygen; even the best filter will not cut it if there is less than 19.6% oxygen in the environment. No respirator will protect you against hydrogen sulfide - though the better ones will give you a longer ""grace period"" in which to escape. A filter which has been used against mercury loses its effectiveness against chlorine, and vice versa. For most situations, it is recommended that you carry a P100 with cartridges that are effective against, at the very least, organic vapors, aerosols, asbestos, and oils.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Sizing</h2>

<p>There is also (in the same article) a good point about sizing. It says basically the same thing as @Mr.Wizard in his answer, that if the mask doesn't form a good seal, it's worthless. Actually:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(...) According to OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Adm.) standards workers need to be fit tested for these before they actually use them. (...)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Buying respirators</h2>

<p>Just a final note, after reading this it was easy to find websites selling P100 masks. Well, some of them looked like regular ""surgical masks"" with a filter on the front, but it was pretty obvious you wouldn't get a good seal. I will go for a ""real"" P100 respirator, which always have pink-colored filters. There's a lot of different brands, sizes, prices and formats available.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UvFoe.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UvFoe.jpg"" alt=""P100 respirator""></a></p>

<p>Thanks guys for the answers you provided. I found this info based on what you told me. Cheers.</p>

<p>Here's a good table with information on respirator ratings and substances to consider (sorry this is a table and I can't format, but here's the <a href=""http://www.todayshomeowner.com/how-to-choose-a-respirator-or-dust-mask/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">source</a>):</p>

"Fixed line: Prusik vs mechanical ascender","2391","","<p>The standard mountaineering textbook Freedom of the Hills has a long discussion of fixed lines, and they state simply that you use a mechanical ascender on them. This seems odd to me, since for most mountaineering I would be carrying a pretty light rack, and it probably wouldn't include a heavy mechanical ascender. I would just have a Prusik loop handy.</p>

<p>What would be the pros and cons of one versus the other? Is a Prusik any less likely to hold if the rope has snow or ice on it? Is it an issue of speed on siege-style climbs, where you're ferrying loads? They seem to have in mind some kind of massive expedition, where you bring a special-purpose 100-meter static line just for this purpose.</p>
","<p>As Freedom of the Hills also states: </p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>""Mechanical ascenders are stronger, safer, faster, and less tiring.""</h2>
  
  <p>– <em>Freedom of the Hills</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The key advantage in there being, <em>""less tiring""</em>, yes you could save a couple hundred grams by not carrying ascenders and instead using some prusiks, but how much do those weight savings benefit you after you've ascended a rope a few times fighting with tight knots and all that extra friction?</p>

<p><strong>Mechanical ascenders should be used in any situation where you plan on using a static rope as your main mode of ascent</strong> versus carrying dynamic rope as fall protection. If you're free climbing, then it's not necessary to carry ascenders, and prusiks will suffice if a situation arrises where you need to ascend the rope.</p>

<p>You very well could use a prusik in every situation you'd use an ascender, but ascenders were invented to replace prusiks, their only disadvantage is their superior weight, and if you're super picky you could maybe also complain about their superior size. But the time and effort you save on an ascent while using ascenders more than makes up for the effort you put into carrying the extra weight. </p>

<p>Your other suspicions are spot on, prusiks can be absolutely useless on iced-up static ropes, I've been in icy situations where my prusssic wouldn't bite the rope at all. Mechanical ascenders will never slip (unless it's completely worn out and doesn't have anymore teeth to bite with).</p>

<p>In aid climbing it's a no brainer, if you're laying siege to a big wall, you'd run the risk of wearing through your prusiks from the milage you put on them, also you're not too concerned about a tiny bit of extra weight because you're not climbing with all your gear, you're hauling most of it. Ascenders are what you use to haul your gear anyways, nobody is going to choose a prusik over an ascender for that job.</p>

<p>For mountaineering, fixed lines are used for high traffic routes on slippery slopes, typically if you're climbing a route with fixed lines, then your ascender is likely going to be the only piece of gear in your rack, the only other thing you'd be carrying would be an ax (unless you're the guy fixing the ropes). I'll use Everest as an example: Everest basically has a fixed rope from the bottom of the Lhotse face all the way up to the summit. Congestion is a problem as it is, I can only imagine how infuriating it would be for a climber queued in line behind a guy using a prussic, <em>""Hold on just a moment while I tie my prusik onto the next rope...""</em> Aside from the increased risk of frostbite from all the finger work, the extra time spent fiddling with your knots could put you at greater risk of getting caught on the mountain after dark, not to mention the fact that prusik knots will <em>not</em> grab the rope unless they are tight and weighted, if you slipped while following a fixed line with a prusik, there's no guarantee that the knot would catch you, at least not right away.</p>

<p>If being weight conscious is your only hang up for carrying ascenders, then I'd recommend getting couple of these:</p>

<p>I never go anywhere without one, it's got all the biting power of an ascender at only 39g. I still recommend carrying prusiks, but they should be used mostly as backups. </p>

<p>One advantage that is noteworthy for prusiks, is that you can also <em>descend</em> a rope with prusiks as easily as you can ascend it. Ascenders are one-way, so you have to stick your fingers in the device to get them to release.</p>

","<p>I would say you need things in this order.  Only #1 is required:</p>

<li><strong>A harness</strong>.  You can't climb with a rope unless you have one.</li>
<li><strong>Shoes</strong>. You can get by with runners, but climbing shoes make a world of difference.</li>

"What should I do if caught in a sand storm?","2377","","<p>If I find myself caught in a sand storm, what should I do? Should I sit it out, or try to keep moving somehow? Can this depend on the severity of the sand storm?</p>
","<p>Sandstorms (or, here in the southwestern part of the US, dust storms) impair the ability to see and breath. The winds also carry heavier debris. Because the storms often occur when it is hot, the wind can contribute to dehydration. The reverse is also true--cold, winter dust storms occur in some places, and hypothermia can become an issue. </p>

<p>Fortunately, most of the time, there is advance warning. Even if you don't hear the alert, you can see the wall of sand or dust moving your way. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>You don't want to be moving around during the storm, the potential for reduced visibility is great. Even if you are wearing goggles, there's a chance you won't be able to see where you are going.  </p></li>
<li><p>Bring your water canister and seek shelter--something sturdy. Even something that leaves you partially exposed will provide a degree of protection from sand/dust and debris.    </p></li>
<li><p>If shelter is not available, then a higher spot is often better than a lower simply because there is usually less particle density at the top of the storm.</p></li>
<li><p>Move away from roads and freeways. In storms like this, drivers are advised to pull off the road, turn off their lights and keep their foot off the break. (Visibility can be so low that other drivers can't see the roadway. Terrible accidents occur because a driver mistook a car parked off the road with a car they thought was travelling on the road.)     </p></li>
<li><p>Cover yourself--arms, legs, neck, eyes, ears, nose, mouth, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you have yourself situated, then try to stay low to the ground and protect your head. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>There are related conditions of which you'll want to be aware. These storms are often accompanied by lightening and rain. Particularly in desert regions, the rain can cause flash flooding. </p>

<p>You asked if the precautions can depend on the severity of the storm. Yes, the size and intensity of these storms vary greatly. When they are gathering steam, it's often not possible to distinguish the storm that has the potential to be more dangerous. Don't be misled, though--these storms are changeable and have the potential to become both fast moving and destructive. </p>

<p>It can't be a pleasant experience as it is meant to deter bears, how can you get it off yourself and your gear in the field (as any residue could potentially either get onto your skin from the gear or potentially attract bears)?</p>
","<p>Going straight to the source, here's a <a href=""https://www.mace.com/pdf/msds_bear_pepper_mace.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Materials Safety Data Sheet (MSDS)</a> for Mace brand pepper spray (note that bear spray is high concentration, high volume pepper spray).

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hyacV.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hyacV.png"" alt=""First Aid measures""></a> </p>

<p>The particular first aid recommendations are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Move victim to fresh air, encourage coughing</li>
<li>Rinse eyes ""immediately thoroughly, pulling the eyelids well away from the eye (15 minutes minimum). Remove contact lenses, if present and easy to do""</li>
<li>""Wash [skin] with plenty of soap and water. Wash contaminated clothing before reuse. Do not apply salves or creams to the affected area. ""</li>

See for example this clip of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apw-e1oRhJA&amp;ab_channel=WarLeaks-DailyMilitaryDefenseVideos%26CombatFootage"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Marine Training</a>. A key realization is that the capsaicin generally does not cause direct damage, but rather activates your pain receptors (particularly the mucous membranes in your mouth, nose, and eyes). As an analogy, eating a hot pepper may make your mouth feel like it is on fire, but your tongue isn't actually burning away. It will be incredibly painful, but you are capable of keeping your eyes open and dealing with any continued threat from a bear as well as providing yourself first aid. </p>

<p>Your concern of what to do if you should get bear spray on yourself is not an idle consideration! I have friends who have had the following happen:</p>

<li>Friend A was sprayed in the face in the middle of a multi-pitch rock climb when Friend B was rummaging through his pack and accidentally discharged a bear spray canister. </li>
</ul>

<p>A couple closing recommendations:</p>

<ul>
<li>UDAP and other manufacturers recommend doing a ""test fire"" in order to train yourself on proper operation. Make sure to do this in a truly deserted area, aiming downwind.</li>
<li>As with any aerosol cannister, make sure to store bear spray below 50 C /122 F. Leaving canister of bear spray inside a car on a hot, sunny day can do detrimental things to your car's upholstery and resale value. </li>

<p>My question is: Why? </p>

<p>When is it <strong>necessary</strong> to double up locking carabiners? Ever? Doubling up non-locking carabiners with opposite and opposing gates was, and still is a safe practice, but locking carabiners were an innovation invented to provide the same security, but eliminate the necessity of using <em>two</em> carabiners. Yet, there are people doubling up locking carabiners, as if they didn't have locks on them at all, and recommending it as best-practice. I support the notion that there is no such thing as overkill, but, if you're using a 25kN biner with a triple action gate, you are going to be plenty safe top-roping or using the biner to tie-in to your harness. So why are so many people strict on the practice of doubling up on lockers?</p>
","<p>A number of prominent climbing organizations (e.g. International Federation of Sport Climbing) either recommend or require two locking carabiners for clip-in attachment to a harness, e.g.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""http://www.ifsc-climbing.org/images/World_competitions/Event_regulations/IFSC-Rules_2015_V1.1.doc"" rel=""noreferrer"">IFSC Rules 2015</a> [1MB DOC]</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>8.3.5</strong> The climbing rope shall be connected to the competitor's harness by two Screwgate or Self-Locking Karabiners arranged in opposition
  (i.e. with the gates in opposition) and the climbing rope must also be
  attached to the Karabiners using a “figure of eight” knot, secured
  with a “stopper” knot or tape.</p>

  <p><strong>4.1.11</strong> USAC recognizes that some host facilities utilize a pre-tied rope as a method to tying-in.  In this case, it is recommended that
  two opposite facing auto-locking carabiners, at the tie-in point, be
  used.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p>Some organizations feel that even two opposite-and-opposed screw-gate carabiners are insufficient, such as the Australian Professional Association of Climbing Instructors (PACI), who released a detailed paper on their recommended protocol:</p>

<ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>THE FOLLOWING ATTACHMENT METHODS ARE UNACCEPTABLE AND FORBIDDEN UNDER

  <p>Some facilities attempt to use two standard screw-gate carabiners to
  achieve connective security. The carabiners are still susceptible to
  cross-loading caused by cyclical loading. Using two carabiners
  provides false security (ie 2 ‘wrongs’ don’t make a right!).</p>

</ul>

<p>Their protocol requires additional measures such as captive-eye carabiners, the reasons for which are detailed within that paper.</p>

<p>Presuming a group are all moving together on a glacier and the leader of the party has fallen into a crevasse (collapsed snow bridge, etc.). The fall was held so all other members of the party are secure. How do the other members of the team go about retrieving their colleague? </p>

<p>What are the main techniques etc. that need to be learned to perform this activity?</p>
","<p>This is a very complicated topic, and you can take an entire course where you learn and practice the techniques. Reading an answer on SE is not going to be enough. You need to practice. The following is just an outline. There is an entire chapter in Freedom of the Hills on glacier travel and crevasse rescue.</p>

<p>The first step is always going to be to construct an anchor so that the team can get out of arrest position. If the leader is the one who's fallen in, then the person at the opposite end of the rope would normally be the one who gets up and builds an anchor, while other team member(s) stay in arrest position. You build the anchor between the lip of the crevasse and the nearest person, so that everyone has tension released from the rope and can stand up. While doing this, you want to make sure not to create more victims, so e.g., the person building the anchor needs to be on a Prusik.</p>

<p>Now talk to the climber and discuss the situation. You want to know if they're hurt.</p>

<p>If possible, you can try to prepare the lip of the crevasse so that the rope doesn't become entrenched. For example you can see if you can get an ice ax or a pack under it. This will be easier if the victim is able to get to a stance and unweight the rope. In most cases, it is not possible to keep the climbing rope from becoming completely entrenched. If you have enough extra line, you may want to prepare a separate portion of the lip and throw down a separate rescue line.</p>

<p>After this, you do not immediately start hauling the victim out. That's a last resort, and often it doesn't work. The following are various options to consider, roughly in order.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>See if the victim can climb out under their own power, while belayed from above.</p></li>
<li><p>There may be an easy way to walk out of the crevasse at the bottom. If so, then you could lower the victim.</p></li>
<li><p>If the victim isn't hurt, he should be able to Prusik up the rope. Getting over the lip may be physically difficult, especially if the rope is entrenched. It may be helpful if there are two ice tools that the victim can use.</p></li>
<li><p>As a last resort, such as in situations where the victim is unconscious or so badly injured that he can't Prusik up, consider trying to set up a pulley system and hauling him out. This may or may not work. If the rope is entrenched, you can't just haul the victim over the lip -- people have been killed that way.</p></li>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes. Any source of water - no matter how large or small - should be avoided when choosing a camp site. 100 meters is just a guideline, 200 meters is better. 200 meters and out of sight is great.</p>

<p>The reasons are several-fold:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Waste</strong> - wastewater should never be put in creeks/lakes/etc - and although many people will walk 200 meters away to dispose of it properly, most wont. The closer people are to a body of water, the more likely they are to say ""ah to heck with it"" and dump it in. It's difficult to resist the temptation to just do a quick rinse of hands, plates, etc in a creek that is right next to you.</li>
<li><strong>Erosion</strong> - The riparian areas next to creeks and lakes are often the most sensitive, and can not handle large amounts of traffic. Traffic up and down and along the creek banks can cause rapid erosion of soil and cause vegetation loss. This is a problem from alpine to canyon ecosystems.</li>
<li><strong>Visual Disturbance</strong> to other hikers - Setting up your tent beside that beautiful pristine lake is an awesome scene, right up until that group across the lake sets their tent up in your view. Don't be 'that guy.' I've successfully distributed 15 groups of backpackers around a high-alpine lake so that every single one of them could pretend they were the only ones out there.  </li>
<li><strong>Disturb/Encounter wildlife</strong> - while you are asleep, chances are there is a whole host of thirsty critters strolling up and down the creek / lake shore looking for drink (or to eat those drinking). These are also natural travel corridors. Your presence can be disruptive to the fauna, or could put you in the path of grumpy wildlife (bears).</li>

To a local, who knows the conditions of a certain area, are tide tables really necessary?  How surprising are the tides ever going to be to someone who's been sailing the same bay for decades?</p>
","<p>Tides are generally not surprising - they do not change much in amplitude from one day to the next, and the peaks happen slightly less than an hour later each day.</p>

<p>The amplitude of the tides mostly follows the phase of the moon. The highest tides happen on the full moon and the new moon, with slack tides in between.</p>

"How can I test out my equipment before a backpacking trip?","2290","","<p>I'm in the slow process of acquiring all of the gear I think I will need to do a week-long backpacking trip somewhere in the Midwest. Many of the more experienced backpackers I've spoken with or read about say that you should test your gear out before you take it on the trail.</p>

<p>I want to test out my setup without breaking it, and hopefully without taking up too much of my time. What do you recommend as a thorough yet reasonable test for a backpacking setup? </p>

<p>I want to develop a backpacking and camping routine with my portable gear but don't have much experience with anything other than car camping. What are your tips and tricks for backpacking success?</p>

<p>EDIT:<br>
The gear I have that I would like to test out includes (but is not limited to) the following: Gregory Baltoro Backpack, sleeping bag, tent, stove, water filter, first aid kit, knife, machete (possibly not included), water bottles, and a cheap, bulky sleeping bag pad.</p>

<p>I suppose I probably need to assemble a mess kit, acquire cooking supplies, and select clothing before I'll be able to do a full test run.</p>
","<p>To test your hiking kit/boots to see if it is all comfortable/fits you can do a day walk but carrying your full rucksack and kit (or stuff of similar weight). This will give you a idea of how your kit fits and the difference in hiking with a full rucksack compared to a daysack to help you judge how far you should aim for.</p>

<p>Most of your camping kit can be tested at home. For example I would definitely check you can put up your tent and light your stove before going on a trip. Getting it wrong at home is much better than doing it wrong in the wild.</p>

<p>Ideally if time allows you could also do a short one/two night backpacking trip before your main trip. This will allow you to check your kit in action so to speak and will give you an idea of some of the small items you may have forgotten. Forgetting loo-roll for a 1 night trip is bad. Forgetting it for a week trip is dire.</p>

<p>On that note you may want to make a list of the kit you need well in advance. If your not confident get someone to check it for any glaring omissions. Then update it with anything you missed after you practice camp.</p>

"What should you do if you see a rattle snake?","2289","","<p>In the area where I live, I have periodically seen a rattle snake when hiking, occasionally at the ready to strike pose. What should I do?</p>
","<p>First of all, you are more likely to hear the rattlesnake than see it. They tend to camouflage themselves quite well, and unless you are paying very close attention, they are easy to miss. I have actually stepped less than a foot from one and not noticed it until I was passing it (It was coiled in a circle, hence my lack of rattle snake bites...)</p>

<p>If you hear a rattle from a rattle snake, STOP. Look around, try to see where it is coming from. If it is coming from the trail in front of you, or near the trail, then find the spot. Walk around the area as best you can, giving the snake at least a 10 foot range if you can do it, or as much as you can if 10 feet isn't available, but do not get closer than 5 feet. The best way to do this is for one of the hiking party to act as a spotter, keeping an eye on the snake while the others pass, then someone who has passed the snake keeps an eye out for it while the spotter passes the snake.</p>

<p>In the event of a snake bite, treat it for the puncture wound, and then seek prompt medical attention. Your hike is probably over at this point in time, so turn back to your vehicle.</p>

"The outdoors, solitude and dealing with loneliness","2288","","<p>I have been out camping a few times, once with a group, the other times with my girlfriend. Although I enjoyed those times very much, I often wondered what would it feel like to enjoy the complete solitude of nature on my own. But every time i think of it, the combination of solitude and nightfall together seem to freak me out. I just cannot handle it. Last night around 11 i went for a bike ride and as soon as i left the last houses and malls, and saw the big open sky and the lake, i got spooked and turned back. What a shame!</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>How do you deal with loneliness and solitude on a a solo camping trip?</li>
<li>Does loneliness make the trip more or less enjoyable?</li>
<li>Does dealing with solitude in wilderness make you feel like a stronger person when you return?</li>
</ol>
","<p>I like being out alone. Generally you have more time for introspection, for getting calm and enjoying what’s around you and inside of you.</p>

<p>Of course there’s times when you have to deal with yourself and your fears when you’re out alone. Even after many nights that I have spent outside alone, I’m still a bit nervous when the sun sets. (I guess it’s an old habit inherited from the times people were not safe outside.) Usually I’m so tired that I simply don’t have the energy to be too nervous :) And the early dawn when the birds start to sing is always worth it:</p>

<p>Yes, I think I’m a stronger person because of it, as I’m a bit more accustomed to my own fear. As for dealing with awkward feelings when being out alone, it’s hard to give a good advice. In such situations I usually simply push myself a little bit; mostly the rational push proves to be beneficial in hindsight. I consider it to be an interesting skill to know when and how far you can override your instincts.</p>

"How should I treat hypothermia?","2277","","<p>When I recognize the <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/q/244/46"">symptoms of hypothermia</a>, how should I treat it? And what are the dangers if the symptoms are ignored?</p>
","<p>When treating mild to medium hypothermia, you should:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stop.  Create a heat source, such as a fire and get the patient warm. </li>
<li>take wet clothing off. The best way to do this if you don't have other clothes to change into, is to take off your underwear/under layers and dry those <em>first</em>, then when those layers are dry, swap them out.</li>
<li>Eat calories, i.e. carbohydrates like candy, sugar, things that will speed up your metabolism and get you warm.  Quick burning energy will help raise the internal temperature of the patient.</li>
</ul>

<p>Main thing is to <strong>stop and get the patient warm.</strong>  Drink hot fluids, start a fire, etc. </p>

<p>Severe hypothermia should be treated medically if at all possible. It is suggested that the best/only way to warm a person is for two people, one on either side of the person, to get in a sleeping bag and warm the person with their body heat (i.e. gradually).  Do <em>not</em> administer hot fluids or attempt to warm in any other way...Do not make the patient move too much, or you will send the body into shock.  </p>

<p>As for dangers, if you ignore hypothermia long enough, the person can go into shock, become semi-conscious, unconscious, etc.  So it is very serious and <em>should be treated right away.</em></p>

"How to arrange 2 Prusiks when ascending a rope?","2253","","<p>If I want to ascend a rope with minimal equipment, I use 2 Prusiks: one tied to my harness, and the second one for my foot.</p>

<p>However, there are two ways to arrange the Prusiks on the rope - the foot below the chest, and the opposite way. The first arrangement is most intuitive and described and in all places on the Internet I looked, e.g. <a href=""http://www.chockstone.org/TechTips/AscendRope.htm"">here</a>. Also, <a href=""http://www.climbing.com/skill/save-yourself-a-guide-to-self-rescue/"">this site</a> tells that it's the right arrangement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Notice that the waist Prusik (E) is above the foot Prusik (F)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but doesn't explain why.</p>

<p>When we practiced crevasse self-rescue, I noticed that my friend used the second ""counter-intuitive"" way; he said that he always used it, while I always used the ""normal"" arrangement. I tried the ""opposite"" arrangement, and it worked marginally better: I could ascend a bit higher each time I extended my leg (this might have been by luck). One difference I noticed is that you have to choose the length of the Prusiks carefully (use a long one for the foot) in order to avoid getting stuck. Otherwise, the arrangements seemed pretty similar.</p>

<p>Is there any reason to choose one arrangement or the other? Should my choice be different in different situations? (assuming I have Prusiks of any length)</p>

<p>P.S. I am not talking specifically about crevasse rescue.</p>
","<p>In case of ascending on a rockface it does not really matter which way round you use it. I put the chest-prusik above the foot-prusik, but this is only because of personal taste. By adjusting the lengths of the slings you can do huge steps in this configuration too. Even though this may not be desirable, as shorter steps can be more efficient (also up to personal taste, try it, find what suits you best).</p>

<p>In case of self rescue out of a crevasse, this is different. The main problem here is getting over the edge, where the rope has most likely cut into the snow/ice. To get over it you have to bring your foot-prusik as high as possible.<br>
Put the foot-prusik above the chest-prusik.  Then get as high as possible until the prusik is stuck because of the snow. Then try to get the rope loose by pushing away from the side of the crevasse to get the foot-prusik higher. Then step into it, get the chest-prusik higher. Repeat until you can get over the edge.</p>

<p>In reality I do not think this will be needed very often, as may have crampons and/or axes to help you ascend or in most cases your partner can help you get out. But for the worst case scenario its always well to know a way.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Small remark concerning ascending knots: If you have a biner, I always recommend using the ""Prohaska"" knot, which does not seem to be known in the english-speaking part of the world, at least I do not find any online reference. The advantage is, that it does not get stuck after being loaded, so no fiddling around the prusik to get it sliding along the rope again. And it is very reliable, not influenced by rope diameters.</p>

"Trekking poles: Collapsed or fixed?","2246","","<p>I recently purchased some collapsible trekking poles (<a href=""http://www.mec.ca/product/5031-555/komperdell-ridgehiker-cork-powerlock-compact/?q=komperdell"">Komperdell Ridgehiker</a>, made in Austria) and found them quite useful in terms of being able to extend or retract them slightly for going up and down hill when my knees are most strained with my 30-40 pound pack.</p>

<p>A major issue with the design was that it snapped at the plastic rings that make up the joints while going downhill with only a 15 pound pack and fast pace, with conscious effort to plunge them in a way where I would not bend them too much while moving forward.</p>

<p>If I am to be abusing the poles like this (absolutely am looking for them to be strong enough for the rare slip somewhere at a minimum) should I look for much pricier ones with stronger joints, or go with fixed? And if I choose fixed, should I size them at a 90&deg; bend or should I size them for say uphill climbing or slightly longer for downhill and possibly adjust the hand loop much longer for when I use them for uphill? Or is the benefit of collapsing mainly for packed size and not much is gained by adjusting them for the incline?</p>
","<p>I don't know of what quality are the poles which you are using, but it's a fact that the better the quality, the better the joints. It's one of the most important components of the price.</p>

<p>For me, a good pair of poles from BlackDiamond behave pretty well under my 90 kg weight with a 30 kg backpack, which totals in 260 pound. This is a good side: yes, expensive poles should help you.</p>

<p>The bad side is that trekking poles are expendable. If you happen to walk on scree, or your are heavy, or you are just unlucky, you poles may live for only a week or two on intensive trekking. Then a tiny accident happens and you find that now you have 3 poles instead of 2. And collapsible poles are weaker than regular ones. Or heavier, or both. And definitely more expensive.</p>

<p>Now, some shopping advice for non-collapsible poles. You can get the most of the poles in 2 scenarios:</p>

<ol>
<li>Going downhill - they protect your knees from shock</li>
<li>Walking on horizontal or slightly inclined ground - they let you move longer by evenly distributing the stress and move faster by keeping better balance.</li>
</ol>

<p>My experience is that when going up, they don't help that much - your legs are much stronger than your arms anyway. And if you are on a really steep slope, you can hold them together with two hands - the same technique as with an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpenstock"">alpenstock</a>.</p>

<p>So if I was going to buy non-collapsible poles, I would go for the size which you are comfortable with walking on the level ground - this will cover most of the scenarios.</p>

<p>Ps. Please note, that I don't have much experience of walking with non-collapsible poles in summer - the conclusions are drawn from observations of collapsible poles usage.</p>

"Is the Park Service continuing its case to re-rename Yosemite Park's historic landmarks?","2238","","<p>I have often checked into the Ahwahnee in Yosemite Valley after emerging, filthy and undernourished, from the backcounty.

<p>There is a plenty of Cordura varieties which will meet your requirements. Make sure to choose waterproof Cordura (with a waterproof glistening film on one side, which will be the inner side of your patch).</p>

<p>Keep in mind, that when it comes to applying force (not friction), the least sturdy part counts, so technically you can't make it more sturdy than original material. To make it equally strong as it was before, you should</p>

<ol>
<li>Choose patch material not weaker than original material</li>
<li>Choose nylon thread, which is NOT stronger, than both original and new materials (otherwise it will rip the weaker material like a knife).</li>
<li>Sew together the two materials overlapped, avoid passing thread through 1 layer of the material (see #2). Usually more stitches of thiner thread is better than few stitches of thicker one (look at your harness where this principle is demonstrated in its extreme).</li>
</ol>

<p>The patch should obviously be bigger than the hole and maybe you'll want to overstitch the edges of both the hole and the patch to prevent them from raveling out.</p>

<p>In such a case, what are the first aid steps that I need to take in case I get bitten by a snake? I have heard about tying a rope tightly just above the bite to prevent the venom from spreading, although I don't know the complete validity of the same.

","<p>There is hardly anything very effective <em>first aid</em> as such, considering the fact that you are  5 hrs walk from any medical facility.</p>

<p><em>I guess I can assume that you will be roaming in rain forests of Agumbe or anywhere in Southern Western Ghats since you referred to King Cobras.</em></p>

<p>If in India, you would definitely like to take a look at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Four_(Indian_snakes)"" rel=""nofollow"">The Big Four</a>. Considering the region where you refer, There are two types of venomous snakes you should know about:</p>

<ol>
<li>Neurotoxic: Indian Spectacled Cobra, King Cobra. (You won't find Monocled or Caspian Cobras in that region), Kraits.</li>
<li>Haemotoxic : All Vipers. (Bamboo Pit Viper aka Green Pit Viper, Saw Scaled Viper, Malabar Pit Viper, Russell's Viper). Malabar Pit Vipers are very rare in Indian Subcontinent, so it is unlikely that you will come across one.</li>
</ol>

<p>I doubt if there are any Chemotoxic snakes in india. There can't be because I have enlisted every possible Fatally Venomous snake in India that I know about.  </p>

<p>Firstly: Usually venomous snakes tend to preserve their venom (except for Juveniles). So, once it bites, it retreats. But still try and ensure that the snake is at a safer distance and get away from it in order to avoid another bite.    </p>

<p>Secondly, To make the anti-venom work efficiently on you, you should try and gather some visual information about the snake that bit you.
Don't try to capture the snake or kill it and bring it with you, but try to capture a picture of the snake from your cellphone/camera (if available), or somehow try and remember it's color and shape so that it can be described, which will help in choosing the right anti-venom.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><em>(Specific to India)</em> - The big 4 in India are Cobras, Saw-scaled Vipers, Russell's Vipers, Kraits. They don't really give you much time to get to the hospital. But this doesn't mean that one should hurry. Keep calm, panic will make the adrenaline come in picture and the blood circulation will increase, only resulting in causing the venom to spread much quicker. If you are going to be carried (on a stretcher), then lie flat, avoiding the movements.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow the bitten part of the body to be lower than the Heart level.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not let anyone try to suck the venom out of the bite site. (I have heard cases of such a horrid thing done, and the one who sucked also got to be treated as the venom in victim's blood entered the sucker's blood through minute injuries in his gum/teeth).</p></li>
<li><p>Wrap a large constricting band between the bite site and the Heart, so that the blood mixed with venom reaching to heart is controlled. <strong>Wrap is snugly, Do not wrap it very tight</strong> or else the venom will damage the entire limb. Usually in such a case, the limb has to be amputated. No one would want to loose the limb if the snake has not injected the amount of venom enough to be fatal. (Have ever heard of a Dry-Bite?? Vipers do that often!)</p></li>
<li><p><em>(Specific to Neurotoxic snakes)</em> - If it is a cobra or a king cobra, try and be awake and communicate with the people who are carrying you.</p></li>
<li><p>Try not to make cuts around bite site as it swells. It will swell, no matter what.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not apply any kind of disinfectant or tourniquet.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove any rings or tightly constricting items because the affected area will swell.</p></li>
<li><p>Do NOT take anything by mouth such as caffeine or alcohol or any painkillers at all. As different wiki's say, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Caffeine is a central nervous system and metabolic stimulant. Stimulants may produce a variety of different kinds of effects by enhancing the activity of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Since Caffeine is a Bronchodilator, which is a substance that dilates the bronchi and bronchioles, decreasing resistance in the respiratory airway and increasing airflow to the lungs.</em>    </p>
</blockquote></li>

<p>If we can relate elevated heart rate due to panicked state of mind and/or adrenaline, and the consequent elevated respiration rate, we should prefer to avoid consuming caffeine which is a Bronchodilator and a Stimulant.</p>

"What is the most effective means of melting snow with body heat for drinking?","2176","","<p>The related question <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/10504/"">Is it safe to drink snow?</a> tells us that in addtion to then normal considerations for any wild water source, you also need to consider how the snow may <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/10504/is-it-safe-to-drink-snow/10506#10506"">tip your metabolism into hypothermia</a></p>

<p>If it is cold and you are traveling and/or without a heat source, what is the best way to melt snow with your body heat to have the least chance of causing hypothermia?  I think there are really two choices, put in your mouth and eat/drink it; or put in a container and hold it near your body to melt, then drink it.</p>
","<p>The best way to melt snow is to put it in a bottle inside your jacket under your mid layers <strong>while you're on the move</strong> and let your body heat melt it. Do not place it against the skin, leave a layer or two between you and the bottle. It's advisable to always leave your bottle in your jacket in subzero temperatures, it can freeze if left in your bag.</p>

<p>Melting snow by body heat is not a fast process, so some foresight is required on your part, if your bottle is getting empty, and you don't know when you're going to find running water next, then put some snow in your bottle to replace what you're drinking. Dropping snow in liquid water will help melt it faster than trying to melt a bottle of dry snow. </p>

<p>Putting snow in your mouth is fine as long as you're warm, I do it all the time, but you are right that putting snow in your mouth will cool you down, so don't do it if you're already cold.</p>

<p>If you are borderline hypothermic, then it would be unwise to try and expend additional body heat in order to melt snow, you need to get up, get moving, and get warm before you can even try it. This will be more difficult when you are dehydrated, as hydration has a huge role in hypothermia. </p>

<p>One other option for melting snow is using solar radiation. Again, it's not a quick process, and you can only do it on a bright sunny day when the temperature is right. This is exactly how the survivors of the 1972 Andes flight disaster got water while they were stranded at the top of the snowy Andes mountains. They used reflective pieces of wreckage from the plane to catch the suns rays, and put small amounts of ice and snow on them then collected the drips in bottles to drink. They also ate each other... but that's <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/10153/in-an-emergency-situation-is-it-healthy-to-eat-human-flesh/10160#10160"">another story</a>. </p>

","<p>Update on the sleeping side of things:</p>

<p>I would use a relatively light sleeping bag, at most a two seasons one. It doesn't get that cold in Scotland, as the north Atlantic drift keeps our climate pretty mild all year. </p>

<p>In terms of tents the key is to get one which can cope with winds as they can get pretty high. I wouldn't expect much over a force 4 for that week though,  the forecasts seem reasonable. I have camped out west in everything from a cheap tent from Asda up to proper tents. Just take normal guy rope precautions, ensure there is a good groundsheet, and you aren't going to get water pouring in, and you should be fine. </p>

"Should food be in a bear bag/canister even when I'm hiking?","2159","","<p>I've read that in the western US, backpackers need bear canisters or bear bags, for bears or for other animals.

<p>My hope was that perhaps there are foldable canisters, and while I might struggle to pack my food volume-wise, this is not a problem during the night.</p>
","<p>Bear populations, bear problems, and aggressive bears are distributed extremely unevenly in California wilderness areas. There are dense populations of problem animals in a few small areas such as Yosemite Valley and Little Yosemite. These are areas with a lot of humans packed into a small space. You're going to the White Mountains, which gets very few human visitors, so you're not going to be in one of those areas with a high probability of bear hassles.</p>

<p>Yes, bears that are used to humans will definitely steal your food right away from you. I've had a bear steal my crackers when I sat down to eat them. A friend had a bear rip open his pack while it was on the ground nearby.</p>

<p>""Do I really need to keep my food in one of those <em>while hiking?</em>"" This question doesn't make sense to me. You have the canister in your pack, taking up space. Why would you not put the food in it?</p>

<p>Bears operate more by smell than we do, so they're most likely to detect your food by its smell. You can cut down on the smell by putting all your food in ziplock bags, inside your bear canister. There are special brands of large ziplock bags such as Aloksack that are claimed to be more odorproof than normal bags. They're convenient, because they're big enough so that you can get all your food inside a single bag.</p>

<p>At night, simply put your bear canister at some distance, say 30 m from where you're sleeping. If a bear does find it, it may try to break into it, but it won't be able to, and you won't be up all night because of the noise.</p>

","<p><strong>Yep!</strong>  If you store your compass near objects that have strong magnets in them (such as your car speakers) it can demagnetize over extended periods of time.  There are a few other issues your compass can run into that makes it less reliable as well.</p>

<li>Air getting into the compass housing (in excess)</li>
</ol>

<p>Bubbles can form within the compass housing when doing big ascents or changes in weather.  There bubbles often go away upon descending or when the weather changes back.  However if the bubbles get large enough it <em>can</em> cause some inaccuracies.  </p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>Traveling to a different regional magnetic zone from which your compass was designed.</li>
</ol>

<p>Compass needles are often balanced based how much dip a magnetic zone has.  This allows the needle to sit level within the housing.  The northern hemisphere is lucky to have a similar magnetic zone throughout, but if you travel south with a northern calibrated compass you might run into troubles.  The image below shows magnetic zones.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A properly pitched tarp works fine in a heavy rain. It just requires
  practice to set it up properly. I've sat out a very intense storm
  under a tarp without getting wet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Question:  How?  For example: How big does it have to be?  Does the tarp serve as its own ground cloth, or do you have a separate ground cloth?  Will this work for a prolonged rainstorm?  Will it work above timberline?        </p>
","<p>There are a few different ways to pitch a tarp. In all cases the challenge, compared to a tent which is full self supporting, is that you need to find enough anchor points to be able to pitch it with adequate tension. In fact often the exact configuration you use will be determined by what points you can find to string it up from. </p>

<p>A common method is to string a cord between two trees. This requires one of the knots to allow you  to adjust the tension in the cord after it is tied as in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YG_-N4NiSlo"" rel=""nofollow"">this video</a> </p>

<p>This line form the ridge of the tarp which is slung over it and then itself tensioned with short cords fixed to the ridge line with a prusik hitch or similar. </p>

<p>Then the four corners are tensioned with guy lines to ground level fixed to pegs, rocks or other trees. </p>

<p>The most important thing about setting it up properly is to be able to tie the proper knots easily, which comes with practice. This is what allows you to tension it properly so that it sheds water effectively and is able to resist the wind. </p>

<p>Tarps are most useful in forested or jungle areas where you can be sure that there will be plenty of trees to tie all the lines to and they are often used in conjunction with hammocks as in this type of terrain it is often difficult to find smooth level ground to pitch  tent on and it is possible to set up a hammock and tarp camp on extremely rough and sloping ground where a tent would be impractical. </p>

<p>On particular advantage compared to a tent is that it is quite versatile for example it can be set up quite high and wide to provide a shelter for cooking, drying clothes or other admin during the day and then lowered to give a more enclosed space at night. Similarly, with practice and in the right terrain they can be set up and taken down quickly enough to be used for rest break in bad weather.  </p>

<p>It is also possible to use a tarp as the basis of an improvised tent using poles carried with you or found locally. This can be a useful stop gap if there are no trees etc around but can be an awkward compromise between a proper tent and the bets use of a tarp and if you want an ultralight system you may be better off with a bivi bag, but this very much depends on the precise circumstances you are expecting. </p>

","<p>Well, it seems that everyone goes with either walk on the wet sand or protect your feet...
However, I've done this in the past since I was a kid (overtime you get used to the hot sand): the really hot sand is just the thin top layer, just underneath is warm, so one way is to dig your foot, a little like kicking the sand at each step, this is generally not appreciated if there is other people on the beach. The other way, that wont get you yelled at but its slower, is to quickly move aside that thin hot superficial layer with your foot and take your step.

","<p>If you can no longer see any trail signs, the best thing to do is go back the way you came until you find one and start searching in a circle from there. Never continue to go further assuming there is going to be a sign just up ahead. You may be right, however the risk of getting lost and something unfortunate happening is too great.</p>

<p>If you become separated or lost, many experts suggest staying put (assuming someone knows you were out there). To help make yourself found, you should make unnatural patterns (straight lines or circles) in contrasting colors (rocks, dirt, debris). Making color contrasting flags provides good source of unnatural color and movement. A universal distress signal is 3 flags or 3 triangles.</p>

<p>If you determine your best course of action is to move on, <strong>always</strong> leave some signal to indicate the direction your are headed. That way if someone finds where you were, they know the direction to look for you in.</p>

If it was legal where you are, how would you tell if the meat is still good?</p>
","<p>For most people to even start considering eating roadkill would mean getting over our personal demon of squeamishness. This thought would not appeal to most.</p>

<p>Here are eight (8) important rules to consider before one should eat roadkill.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>8 Rules of Roadkill</strong></p>
  
  <p>Follow these Roadkill Rules to help determine if food by Ford is safe to swallow.</p>
  
  <p><strong>1. Legal Stuff</strong></p>
  
  <p>Any fur-bearing animal or bird is edible. However, laws on harvesting roadkill or possession of protected species vary from state to state.</p>
  
  <p>In the Peach state, motorists may collect deer without notifying authorities. Bear collisions must be reported but you get to keep the bruin.</p>
  
  <p>Texas and California are among the few states that prohibit roadkill collection. In Alaska, the Fish and Wildlife personnel collect reported road-killed animals and distribute to charities helping the needy.</p>
  
  <p>Check your state laws first!</p>
  
  <p><strong>2. Impact Damage</strong></p>
  
  <p>The point of impact determines how much meat is salvageable. My experience with broadside impacts are not good. Internal organs usually rupture and taint the meat. Not to mention all the bloodshot meat. As in hunting, a head shot saves meat.</p>
  
  <p>Tire treads over the body usually means a bloody mess. Squashed squirrel would require a spatula to remove from the asphalt and should be avoided.</p>
  
  <p><strong>3. Clear Eyes</strong></p>
  
  <p>If the eyes are intact and clear, the animal is likely a fresh kill. Cloudy eyes hint that the animal has been dead for some time (more than a few hours).</p>
  
  <p>Creamy discharges around the eyes or other orifices indicate a sick animal. If the eyes are gone, leave it alone.</p>
  
  <p><strong>4. Stiffness and Skin</strong></p>
  
  <p>Rigor mortis sets within a few hours of death. This is not a deal breaker depending on other indicators. The steak in the butcher’s glass counter has undergone the same process of “decay” or tenderizing.</p>
  
  <p>Pinch the skin of the animal, unless it’s a porcupine, to check if the skin still moves freely along top of the muscle beneath. If so, you’re probably okay. Skin stuck to the muscle is a bad indicator. If fur can be pulled from the hide with a slight tug, the animal has been deceased far too long.</p>
  
  <p><strong>5. Bugs and Blood</strong></p>
  
  <p>Fleas feed on the blood of warm blooded animals. Brush the hair on the carcass and inspect for fleas like you would on a family pet. If fleas are present, that’s a good thing. Fleas won’t stick around on a cold body.</p>
  
  <p>There’s usually blood involved when animals come in contact with 3,000 pound machines in motion. Blood all over the road may mean there’s too much damaged meat to salvage. The color of blood present should be a dark red, like, well, fresh blood. Dark puddles of blood have been there been there a while.</p>
  
  <p>Flies could be a bad sign. They lay larvae in wounds and other openings of the body. A few flies present isn’t always a deal breaker. A prior wound on a living animal may contain maggots. We had a live deer seek refuge in my mother-in-laws car port who had a broken hind leg from a vehicle collision which was infested with maggots. I approached her in an attempt to humanely dispatch her and put her out of her misery. Sadly, she gained her footing and disappeared through our neighborhood woods.</p>
  
  <p>In the hot, humid summers of Georgia, it only takes a few minutes for flies to zero in on dead stuff. Which brings us to our next consideration...</p>
  
  <p><strong>6. Climate and Weather</strong></p>
  
  <p>The weather conditions and geographical location are variables to consider. Cold to freezing temperatures is ideal – think… roadside walk-in freezer or fridge. Meat will decompose quickly in hot and humid conditions.</p>
  
  <p><strong>7. Smell</strong></p>
  
  <p>This one is pretty obvious.</p>
  
  <p>If it has a putrid odor, leave it alone. You don’t have to be a TV survival expert to identify bad meat. Your old factory sensors will let you know… along with your gag reflex.</p>
  
  <p><strong>8. Collection and Processing Tips</strong></p>
  
  <p>Our vehicles are prepared with Get Home Kits. You may want to add a few items to it or build a separate Roadkill Kit. My kit is simple and includes:</p>
  
  <p>•Tarp</p>
  
  <p>•Surgical gloves</p>
  
  <p>If you don’t drive a pickup truck, wrap large carcasses in a tarp and place in the vehicle for transport. Smaller animals usually go in a contractor grade garbage bag to get home.</p>
  
  <p>It’s common sense in my mind… Do NOT field dress an animal on the side of the road! It’s dangerous, illegal (hopefully), unsightly, and disrespectful to both animal and human. I’ve seen some really stupid and disgusting practices over the years from unethical “hunters” and idiots.</p>
  
  <p>If you’re not prepared to harvest game properly, stick with the supermarkets.</p>

"Canoeing in a thunderstorm","2124","","<p>What are your chances of getting struck by lightning in a canoe? I've done a lot of canoeing on stormy lakes before, but when the thunder comes what is the real risk of getting struck by lighting? </p>

<p>My thinking is, if you're on a mountain lake surrounded by mountains, the lighting is much more likely to strike the mountainside than it is to strike the water; the size of the lake, and the elevation of the storm clouds would of course have to be factored into your risk assessment, but even if the lake was wide enough, and the storm low enough and out over the middle of the lake so the lightning would strike the water, is there a chance that the lightning will strike a person sitting in a kevlar canoe? Does the construction of the canoe make you more or less likely to be struck by lightning? Will striking the water be the path of least resistance? </p>

<p>How likely are you to be struck in a canoe and what should you do if caught in a thunderstorm?</p>
","<p>Your chances of getting hit by lightning while on the water are actually higher then if you are on the beach. (<em>unless you are fishing</em>)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fishing contributed to almost half - 46% - of the water-related deaths involving lightning strikes; while boating (power boats, canoes, sailboats, tubes) added another 25%. About 20% of the victims were relaxing on a beach, while about 9% of the victims had been swimming. <a href=""http://www.surfertoday.com/surfing/9196-surfers-are-an-easy-target-for-lightning-strikes"">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>One boat insurance company reports the odds of your boat being hit is 1.2 in 1,000. It later goes on to say that a multi hull boat in Florida is the most likely to be struck. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to the most recent (2000-2005) BoatUS Marine Insurance claim files, the odds of your boat being struck by lightning in any year are about 1.2 in 1000. <a href=""http://www.boatus.com/seaworthy/swlightning.asp"">source</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you can get out of the water, do.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Even though the odds are in your favor that your boat may never be hit by lightning, if it happens it can have devastating effects. Don't take a chance, protect yourself. If you are in a small boat and close to shore when a thunderstorm approaches, get in and off the water immediately. <a href=""http://www.boatsafe.com/nauticalknowhow/lightning.htm"">Source</a></p>

<p>Lightning safety tips</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>AVOID: Avoid water. Avoid all metallic objects. Avoid the high ground. Avoid solitary tall trees. Avoid close contact with others - spread out 15-20 ft. apart. Avoid contact with dissimilar objects (water &amp; land; boat &amp; land; rock &amp; ground; tree &amp; ground). Avoid open spaces.</p>
  
  <p>SEEK: Seek clumps of shrubs or trees of uniform height. Seek ditches, trenches or the low ground. Seek a low, crouching position with feet together with hands on ears to minimize acoujstic shock from thunder.</p>
  
  <p>KEEP: Keep a high level of safety awareness for thirty minutes after the last observed lightning or thunder. <a href=""http://lightningsafety.com/nlsi_pls/ploutdoor.htm"">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you can't get out of the water, stay 20 to 50 feet (6 to 15 meters) away from other boats and tall objects (like cliffs).  Get as low in the boat as you can, don't touch anything wet or metal. </p>

","<p>The issue with the bottles isn't so much the ""bottle"" as it is the pump. On an MSR bottle, a pump screws into the top, then a specific MSR-style hose (from a stove) attaches to the pump. On a Trangia, the attachment system is different (as per <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Trangia-742527-Gas-Burner/dp/B000N8JRB2/ref=pd_sim_sg_14"">This Gas Burner</a>, or <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000S0FIIQ"">This One</a>, depending on fuel, I think). The question in your case would be whether the threading is identical in the top of a <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000W3CDF0"">Trangia valve</a> as it is on an <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000BBF2SS"">MSR fuel pump</a>.</p>

<p>Based on <a href=""http://www.spiritburner.com/fusion/showtopic.php?tid/21705/tp/1/"">this forum topic discussion</a> on fuel caps (they were not discussing pumps, but the fitment should be similar or the same), I'd say that they are the same (and might be the same as Sigg and Primus as well). I don't own a Trangia bottle so I can't confirm this, but that's what the web discussion seems to indicate. Also, pages such <a href=""http://kotisivu.dnainternet.net/luontola/ultimate/kaplorer_eng.htm"">This one</a>, and <a href=""http://www.bushcraftuk.com/forum/showthread.php?t=17382"">This one</a> indicate that there is a great deal of adaptability with such attachments.</p>

<p>I do have a couple of unanswered concerns, such as what pressure the Trangia bottle can withstand, and how adaquate the pump seal would be. Otherwise, I think it's worth a shot. Perhaps someone who owns both items can demo it and let us know.</p>

<p>As an amusing side note, even without any answers this question pops up on the first page of a Google search for ""MSR stove Trangia bottle"".</p>

"Sleeping in an inflatable boat","2116","","<p>I am going to make a trip on a river in an inflatable rowing boat. The trip is going to be two days long: one day down the river and the next day - back.</p>

<p>The question is how I should spend night. I don't have a tent and now am pondering over whether I should buy it and spend night onshore or not. Have anybody spent night in the boat on the water? Is it safe? What safety precautions should I take?</p>

<p>The river is relatively calm, it's the Dnieper river in Ukarine, and at the section I'm going to boat at it is about 500 meters (540 yards) wide, current speed is 0,6 - 0,7 m/s (up to 2 miles per hour).</p>
","<p>I would suggest not sleeping on the boat. Apart from the safety issues this will bring up - the boat could slowly lose air, or could start drifting away, the water could rise, ... - it will not protect you against wind or rain.</p>

<p>So in any case, the least I'd suggest for you to get is a good tarp or a rain-proof bivouac sleeping bag. A tent is obviously even better, but will also be more expensive. Without these you'll not be a happy camper should it rain during the night.</p>

<p>Another possibility:<br>
You could pull the boat to shore and use it as an improvised shelter. For example you raise it up on one side using the paddles, which will form a sort of roof over your head. Then you'll only need to worry about a sleeping mat and sleeping bag to keep you warm at night.</p>

"How much does body fat actually insulate you against the cold?","2114","","<p>I'm not a big guy, but I can sit in a cold pool of still water for a long time if I stay still and control my breathing, my skin gets cold, but after you get past the cold shock I can sit there rather comfortably without any signs of my core temperature dropping (shivering, etc.). One of my favourite things to do is sit up to my neck in the cold spring pool (4°C) at Ainsworth Hot Springs for about a half hour at a time and watch the shocked expressions on peoples faces as they dip their toes in the water, or try to take a quick dip, then look at me in bewilderment as I sit there seemingly unfazed by the temperature. </p>

<p>When we were kids we used to tube down the Elk River in BC, which is fed by a glacier lake. I have one sibling who was quite a bit thicker than the rest, and while the rest of us tried our best to stay on top of our tubes and out of the cold water, they would just float in a life jacket with the current, without any signs of really getting cold aside from hands and feet.</p>

<p>I've been pondering this lately, wondering how much having a good layer of fat on you can help insulate against the cold. There are a plethora of animals in nature who rely on a thick layer of blubber for insulation; narwhals, beluga whales, walruses and many others for example who don't also have fur. Fat obviously won't protect you from frostbite, your skin can still freeze, but I wonder if it might help prevent advanced stages of frostbite (freezing down to the deep tissues like muscles, tendons and bone). Or how about hypothermia? Are obese people less likely to become hypothermic? One thing I was considering was in the case of severe exposure, where frostbite and freezing are a serious danger. Would a large person have better chances of survival if they were to submerge themselves in water? Liquid fresh water is typically always warmer than than zero in nature, if it was 20 or 30 degrees below zero, could a person with a thick adipose layer survive the cold and protect themselves against frostbite by sitting up to their neck in a pool of still water? Would their fatty layer help insulate their core like a layer of blubber? </p>
","<p>In humans not a lot. There are significant differences between blubber and fat. Though blubber is mostly made of fat it has very different composition to human fat. An animal with blubber also uses it in very different ways to the way a human uses fat. Fat in a human is an energy source, not insulation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(blubber)... can comprise up to 50% of the body mass of some marine
  mammals during some points in their lives, and can range from 2 inches
  (5 cm) thick in dolphins and smaller whales, to more than 12 inches
  (30 cm) thick in some bigger whales, such as right and bowhead whales.
  However, this is not indicative of larger whales' ability to retain
  heat better, as the thickness of a whale's blubber does not
  significantly affect heat loss. <strong>More indicative of a whale's ability
  to retain heat is the water and lipid concentration in blubber</strong>, as
  water reduces heat-retaining capacities, and lipid increases them.[2]</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blubber"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>Blubber is also rich in blood vessels (which the fat of a human isn't), these blood vessels adapt to temperature, this allows the animal(s) that have it to react to changes in temperature. So a whale, for example, can ""re-route"" blood to underneath the blubber when cold. In humans the blood is outside of the fat layer (on the skin). A constant supply of blood is required prevent frost bite (the skin dying).</p>

<p>Marine mammals have other adaptations too, the have a relatively low surface area to mass (when compared to say a human). So they can retain their heat more efficiently in their large bodies. Humans have a large surface area to body mass. We're adapted to life in much warmer climates, having evolved originally in Africa.</p>

<p>If it's really cold they also migrate into warmer waters, nursing mother wales do this.</p>

<p>A bigger factor in influencing humans in extreme cold is how their body reacts when it drops below the ideal 37.5C temperature. Below this temperature human organs begin to shut down, vital ones like the brain, heart, liver, etc. When this happens it's called <a href=""http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Hypothermia/Pages/Introduction.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hypothermia</a>. A body temperature between 32C and 35C is mild hyperthermia. Below this is life threatening.</p>

<p>An interesting case study is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gu%C3%B0laugur_Fri%C3%B0%C3%BE%C3%B3rsson"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Guðlaugur Friðþórsson</a> (an Icelandic fisherman involved in a ship wreck in the arctic ocean). He survived 6 hours in 5C water. When he got to land his core body temperature was 34C yet he showed limited signs of hypothermia. No one really understands how this process works as it's very rare but it appears some people have an ability to protect their vital organs even when their core body temperature drops below what would kill 99% of humans. Though overweight it was decided that this had a limited impact on his survival and it was his natural (unexplained) adaptations that saved him.

"How to choose a class of rapids for a variety of skill levels?","2110","","<p>I've been whitewater rafting (and inadvertent whitewater canoeing ;) a couple times, and I'd like to get a bunch of friends together to go with me. I'd bring enough people to fill a raft (5 or 6), but the problem is, everyone will have different levels of skill and experience.</p>

<p>What should I consider when choosing which class of rapids we paddle? Are there any rules of thumb for how the ratio of experienced to new whitewater rafters corresponds to the rapid class we can safely manage?</p>

<p>For example, if three people are experienced whitewater rafters and three people have never been before, would class IV rapids be unsafe for the group as a whole? </p>
","<p>Yes. Class IV would be unsafe for the group as a whole, if it occurs in the first couple of days of the trip. If you have 1 or 2 experienced people in the paddle raft and you keep one at the back to set the pace and call commands you should be fine in class III, with a good riverside training the morning you leave. </p>

<p>I frequently do 4 days on the upper salt river in Arizona. During high water 1 of the rapids on day 3 is a class IV. We have taken people who have never paddled before in paddle rafts and they usually do fine because they have a couple of days of paddling rough class 3 rapids. Anyone new we take gets an hour long or so training riverside the morning we leave, and in any calm patches of water we practice spinning the raft, high-side, and rescues, so when it needs to happen in a rapid they are prepared.</p>

<p>Also, remember to take into account the swimming capability of the new paddlers. If they are not strong swimmers or not confident in their ability, even Class III might be too much.</p>

<p>Honestly they would probably be fine, especially with experienced people to help them, but it would not be a risk I am willing to take. </p>

"How to make a fully-enclosed tarp setup with a 1.4 x 2.4 meter tarp, for one person?","2105","","<p>While I am moving more and more towards an ultralight approach to the outdoors, I am discovering that carrying less doesn't only lighten the load on your body; it also puts you closer to the environment.

","<p>OK, I finally tried the setup inspired by <a href=""http://outdoorswanderer.blogspot.co.uk/2014/06/minitarpology.html"">this site</a>, which can be fully closed by pegging the sides closer to the middle, and pegging it directly on the ground on the opposite side of the entrance.</p>

<p>It would be quite a tight night and you would need to leave your rucksack out, if it's big. But I was able to put the sleeping bag out of the bag from the entrance and to enter it whilst remaining under the tarp itself.
That would be harder to do with a sleeping bag with no zip.
Also the sleeping bag will be somewhat compressed at the foot where there's less height space. 
It would not be your coziest night ever, but indeed it is possible to do a completely enclosed setup.</p>

<li>Wear a helmet</li>

"How do you flavour your water on camping trips?","2093","","<p>Always drinking pure water can be boring and tasteless, especially when you have to filtrate it or use sterilizer/purification tabs which might cause the water to taste really bad.</p>

<p>What are easy (lightweight and not complicated to use) ways to get some flavour and diversion in my drinking while being outdoors for several weeks?</p>
","<p>As a former soldier (and Medic), I personally don't flavour my water during the outdoors.  </p>

<p>The contents of the canteen/flask might be required for a non-drinking purpose such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Eyewash</li>
<li>Rinsing</li>
<li>Medical</li>
<li>Cleaning etc</li>
</ul>

<p>However, I do flavour my water on a day-to-day basis for the gym etc using super-concentrate micro capsules such as <a href=""http://www.robinsonssquashd.co.uk/default2_closePh2.aspx"">Squash'd</a></p>

<p>If you have not seen them then you can read about the growth in the <a href=""http://www.thegrocer.co.uk/fmcg/britvic-predicts-200m-category-for-super-concentrate/352120.article"">super-concentrate market</a>.</p>

<p>As a frequent Coca-Cola and Pepsi drinker I am a bit of a sugar addict and I can attest to the hyper-sweetness of even a 1/2 second squirt of Squash'd.  It is very flavoursome without being overpowering.  One little capsule should last for a week easily.  </p>

<p>Electrolyte water however is really just a fancy name for some carbs (sugar) with a dash of salt.  You can make exactly the same chemical solution at home with a pinch of salt and the juice of a citrus fruit - which is exactly what we used to make soldiers sip when suffering from heat exhaustion.  For the price of a Lucozade sachet, I could make 40-50 litres of homemade electrolyte.  </p>

"Indoor vs. Outdoor sport climbing","2093","","<p>As I started indoor climbing this year I would like to know what distinguishes it from outdoor sport climbing, especially when you are lead climbing.</p>

<p>I know that there are huge differences in safety, like outdoors</p>

<ul>
<li>there aren't always bolts available as belay points (like indoors) so we need to use the less safe cams/friends, nuts, ...</li>
<li>bolts might be insecure</li>
<li>stand isn't as stable so we should belay dynamically</li>
<li>bigger falls because of less belay points</li>
</ul>

<p>This list isn't complete.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What could you add to this list of safety concerns?</p></li>
<li><p>Besides from safety, what are major differences between sport (indoor) climbing and rock (outdoor) climbing?</p></li>
<li><p>Are the difficulties comparable to indoor scaling systems?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As for the last point I can think of tougher conditions outdoors (again safety issues or strong wind, wet rock, psychology aspects and so on) and pure length of the routes. Besides that, I <em>guess</em> an indoor UIAA 6 should be as tough as an outdoor UIAA 6.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>You are right guys, the question was too broad when asked about comparing sport to trad climbing.</p>

<p><strong>Edit2</strong></p>

<p>Why do you still think, the question is too broad, comparing bolted indoor sport climbing to bolted outdoor sport climbing?</p>
","<p>This is a pretty broad question; I'll try to answer, but this is going to be long.</p>

<p>You have already noted many differences between indoor and outdoor climbing. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What could you add to this list of safety concerns?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are some more ideas on safety:</p>

<ul>
<li>You mentioned ""pure length of routes""; the issue here seems to be about having a <strong>too short rope</strong>, so if you don't have a knot on the other end, the climber will fall when he is being lowered (i.e. when both the climber and the belayer least expect that). In indoor climbing, someone more experienced is usually responsible for rope length, so this is less likely to happen.</li>
<li><strong>Falling rocks</strong> are often a major safety concern (you should wear a helmet, even though it doesn't guarantee safety).</li>
<li>You mentioned insecure bolts, but there may be <a href=""http://climbing.about.com/b/2010/10/17/worn-carabiner-cuts-climbing-rope-at-red-river-gorge.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">other <strong>hazardous pieces of gear</strong></a>; in the indoor gym they are certainly going to check and replace gear regularly.</li>
<li>In the case of an accident, <strong>help may be far away</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>Besides from safety, what are major differences between sport (indoor)
  climbing and rock (outdoor) climbing?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Differences besides safety (just a few of ideas; there certainly is an enormous number of differences, like between ""working out"" in a gym vs. running natural trails):</p>

<ul>
<li>Most important difference: <strong>natural rock is natural</strong>; it's just ""the real thing"" vs. pieces of plastic. Depending on your spiritual inclination, you may absolutely hate climbing gym after you try ""real"" rock climbing.</li>
<li>Natural rocks have <strong>different types</strong> (limestone/sandstone/granite/other), while gyms have plastic, maybe wood and the occasional imitation of limestone (plaster?).</li>
<li>Holds on natural walls have an <strong>infinite number of shapes</strong>, so ""what you see"" is not ""what you get"" (the hold may be better or worse than you expect). It may also be tricky to find the usable holds, when they are not painted in colours. It's common to have long holdable cracks in nature, which are hard to find in gyms. There is also ""slab climbing"" (60° walls with almost invisible holds), which you cannot find in gyms.</li>
<li>Depending on how many natural rocks you have, <strong>on-sight climbing</strong> may be either very hard or very easy to find. For example, when I go climbing to my usual crag(s), if I want to climb a route I have never tried, it has to be much harder than I am able to (because I have tried almost all routes there already) - but when I go to a new place, I climb just new routes. This is unlike indoor climbing, where they are constantly building new routes.</li>
<li><strong>Route-finding</strong> may be tricky in nature - depends on the site.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are the difficulties comparable to indoor scaling systems?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Regarding grades:</p>

<p>The idea is to have the grades for indoor and outdoor climbing as equal as possible; however, it's not really possible... For the reasons you mentioned (variable weather conditions; unusual bolting). Here are some more ideas on what differences you can find:</p>

<ul>
<li>Some rock-climbing sites have a sort of ""snobby"" ""elitist"" culture: they insist that in their site ""F6a is hard, and stop complaining"", while others say that ""F7a should be doable, otherwise no one will come here"".</li>
<li>You may be individually well-suited for a particular type of rock, but ill-suited for another (overhangs/vertical walls).</li>
</ul>

<p>So a route in outdoor climbing may be easier or harder then an indoor route of the same grade.</p>

"How should I put out a campfire while away from civilization?","2086","","<p>If I build a campfire, but need to move on before it goes cold, how should I put it out? I wouldn't want to use my drinking water. Should I bring a covering to smother it with?</p>
","<p>A large part of this falls down to planning as to where you build the fire in the first place. If you have got a natural water source nearby then build close to there which will give you an ample source of water to make sure the fire is doused. As an added measure, it also provides an easy source of water for putting out your fire if it starts to spread beyond where you intended.</p>

<p>If not, then at least try to build your fire on a stony area away from foliage where the fire may spread more easily, or will have more material to spread out of control if it re-ignites.</p>

<p>However, bear in mind these are just things that can help, they're not substitutes for properly ensuring a fire is dead before moving on. I'd feel comfortable smothering on stony ground and then waiting until things had cooled down, but at the end of the day if you haven't got the time to make sure a fire is properly put out and cooled down, you shouldn't have started one in the first place.</p>

<p>In short, you just shouldn't move on before your fire is out and has cooled down, but there are steps you can take for that process to happen faster.</p>

"Backpacking or hiking in areas open to hunting","2083","","<p>A lot of areas that are good for hiking or backpacking are also popular hunting grounds.  I am an avid backpacker and hiker, but I do not know much about hunting.  How do I find out what is the hunting season in a particular area, and when backpacking during hunting season, how do I avoid getting shot?</p>
","<p>The most important thing is to know what is being hunted so you can know how the hunters should be approaching their prey. It's best to talk to several hunters to find out from them where they will be concentrating, but it's hard to control for any random person with their own ideas about how they will be approaching their hunting. The vast majority of hunters are extremely safety conscious and will go out of their way to educate anyone who is curious about safety and sharing the outdoors.</p>

<p>Turkey season is generally horrible since hunters are so camouflaged and hidden whereas deer season is better with everyone lit up in blaze orange for visibility.</p>

<p>In your case, you probably don't really care if you are scaring off the game so wear vibrant colors, make a lot of noise and avoid heavy brush and areas with limited sight lines. Wide open areas with a clear view are safest. Noise is really your best tool since you also should be concerned about ricochet, misfires and target practice as well as intentionally placed shots where you happen to be directly behind the target.</p>

<p>Any resources to maps, tracks, tips and tricks would be welcomed from people that hiked there or that have researched the topic extensively. Thank you!</p>
","<h2>Camping</h2>

<p>If you're walking with a tent and pitching it up somewhere high in the mountains (this may not be legal, but if you're well behaved nothing will happen), you won't have a problem with crowds.  Very few people hike with a tent.  In general, as soon as you're more than ~2 hours from the nearest car park, you're out of the crowds.  That being said, it may be difficult (and illegal) to camp in the wild, and you might depend on camp sites.  With a small backpackers tent, you won't have a problem finding a spot, but you will be sharing a camp site with car tourists with big tents, electrical light, music, etc; those camp sites are in civilisation.</p>

<h2>Wildlife</h2>

<p>Bears are rare in the Spanish Pyrenees and non-existent in the French ones.<br>
You're very lucky if you see a bear.
There are no pumas.  Wildlife is not a hazard for hiking in the Pyrenees.</p>

<h2>Maps</h2>

<p>On the French side, by far the best maps are the 1:25.000 map series from <a href=""http://www.ign.fr"">French IGN</a>.  However, for a long trip you might need many sheets to cover the route, so you could choose the 1:50.000 map series instead.  On trails, these are usually good enough.  The French maps cover part of Spain, too.</p>

<p>On the Spanish side, maps are less reliable.  My experience with the official maps from <a href=""http://www.ign.es"">Spanish IGN</a> is that many hiking trails are simply missing on the map.  Special park maps, only available for touristic regions, may be better.  I haven't been to the Pyrenees, and can't recommend specifically.</p>

<h2>Where to hike</h2>

<p>I haven't been to the Spanish side of the Pyrenees.  From what I've understood, they're quite dry.  A friend who has lived in Toulouse (close to the French Pyrenees) recommends <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GR_10_%28France%29"">Grande Randonéé 10</a>, which runs close to the border on the French side.  The entire GR will be too long, but you can do a segment of it.  GR's are well-marked with red-white markings.</p>

"Can I light a kerosene lamp with flint & steel or a magnifying glass?","2080","","<p>I am planning a canoe trip, and will be bringing a kerosene lamp for light.  As a backup fire lighting option I am planning on bringing flint &amp; steel and possible a magnifying glass. </p>

<p>Can either of these be used to light the wick on a kerosene lamp?</p>
","<p>If you think about it, lighting a kerosene lamp with a flint and steel is essentially the same as <a href=""http://youtu.be/T-lwHd6HKlk?t=38s"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">lighting a Zippo Lighter</a>. The classic of classic lighters has a flammable-fluid soaked wick that is ignited by a small flint and steel. The only significant difference is that Kerosene has a slightly higher <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_nVhkvPEpI"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">flashpoint</a> than Lighter Fluid (Naphtha). </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eQ4L5.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Lighter Fluid's flashpoint is at about 5°C, which means at ~5°C Lighter fluid will let off enough vapour for it to react to a nearby flame and ignite. Kerosene's flashpoint is higher, at ~38°C (just about body temperature) so it'll only put off enough vapours to ignite when it's warm. So you could do it, <strong>you <em>could</em> light a Kerosene lamp with a flint and steel, <em>but ONLY if it was a really hot day (~40°C) or if your lamp had been left in the sun long enough for your canister to heat up.</em></strong> Considering that Kerosene's flash point is pretty much at par with body temperature, theoretically, in a desperate situation, you could conceivably warm the Kerosene canister up enough with your body for it to reach it's minimum flashpoint. But lighting a small fire and using that flame to light your lamp would be a much easier solution.</p>

<p>The only time you could light anything with a magnifying glass is during the day when there is enough intense sunlight to focus a beam. So even if you could get it started with this method, it wouldn't be practical unless you plan on burning your lamp until it gets dark, or taking it from the light into somewhere dark like a cave.</p>

"What do you do if the fire does get ""out of control""?","2075","","<p>Let's say you are camping with a large group, and someone starts a camp fire.  You're away for a bit and come back to find everyone panicking and the fire to be much larger than actually planned (ie, burning into surrounding grass or brush).</p>

<p>What steps can/should be taken to get the fire under control?</p>
","<p>I see three priorities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Make sure no one gets hurt</li>
<li>Make sure possessions needed for survival (food, tents) are not destroyed</li>
<li>Make sure the fire doesn't spread further and become a forest fire</li>
</ul>

<p>If the campsite you're using is an officially-sanctioned one, this last is probably the least likely to be a problem. You have a large group of people, so you can tackle all of these things at once as long as you <strong>take control</strong> and <strong>give people things to do</strong>. Don't say ""somebody X!"" Turn to someone and say ""Steve, X! Susan, Y!"" and so on. The things they need to do (pretty much all in parallel, but listed in priority order) are:</p>

<ul>
<li>put shoes on</li>
<li>get large containers (buckets, washing up bowls) of water if the source is near enough - ten or twenty steps - to make running back and forth with water reasonable</li>
<li>take towels and blankets to the water to drench them for use as smotherers</li>
<li>get small children or injured people well out of the way of both the fire and the people who are dealing with it, including out of the path to the water, and for small children, leave someone in charge of them so they stay out of the way</li>
<li>move tents or packs that appear to be in the way or in danger</li>
<li>throw water on the edges of the fire, then run back to refill the container</li>
<li>use large wet towels, coats or non-polymer blankets, tarps etc to smother flames if possible, then pick up the slightly singed smotherer and do it again somewhere else. Resoak as needed</li>
<li>move benches and other fireplace furniture out of the way of the people who are running around with water and smothering-blankets</li>
</ul>

<p>Watch while this is happening and evaluate. You may need to get some people to start taking children, packs, and tents down to the water and loading them into canoes, or out to a road or other less-likely to burn spot from where you can leave or be rescued. There may also be someone kicking up a fuss about something not critical for survival that is in danger - a stuffed animal, or a book - and you may be able to delegate someone to deal with that, or to tell the wailer ""we have to concentrate on keeping it from spreading to the tents!"" which should keep the noise level down if nothing else. If anyone is hurt, getting someone to start giving them first aid is also a good idea if you have spare people with no buckets or smothering-blankets to use and no other duties like moving stuff to be done first. You also have to decide if things have reached the ""call 911"" stage and if so, direct someone to do so. This may involve telling them where to find a phone.</p>

<p>Keep directing people, keep watching if it's getting bigger or smaller, keep aware of how many people are in danger and which possessions are in danger, and either you will get it back under control or you will evacuate to whatever extent you can. </p>

<p>True story: a family member was in a tent/cabin (permanent structure, canvas walls and roof) that caught fire in the night while winter camping. He carried his sleeping bag with him on the way out; he doesn't know why. Without that, as they stood in the pitch black cold (-10C) , hours from help with no food, water, or first aid, only the clothes they had been sleeping in, the two burned teens would, everyone agrees, have died. (The unburned kids were able to move around to keep warm, some got a little frostbite but that was all.) Do not underestimate the importance of keeping stuff safe in addition to people.</p>

In the few times I have gone snowshoeing, I've basically just treated it like normal walking, just with extra equipment on my feet. Is there a more nuanced technique that I may not be aware of? For example, with skiing, you learn to kick-and-glide instead of just shuffling back and forth. What (if anything) can I do when snowshoeing to ensure that I'm expending my energy efficiently and doing it ""right""?</p>
","<p><strong>Walking technique</strong></p>

<p>You can save energy by not <strong>lifting</strong> your shoe higher then needed. And also how long steps you take. If it's steep try to make <strong>smaller steps</strong> to save energy. If you walk with poles <strong>use your poles</strong> with the correct length and technique as with cross-country-skiing, both for every step, one per step or asymmetric.</p>

<p><strong>Path planing</strong></p>

<p>I think you can save the most energy, when you <strong>use existing snowshoe paths</strong>. If there are no existing paths you can create a efficient path. When going uphill try to go as <strong>straight up</strong> as possible and use the <strong>heel lift</strong>. The heel lift helps you to walk uphill like on stairs and save energy. The reason to walk straight up is, to reduce distance where you need to walk trough heavy snow and also traversing is much more exhausting and frustrating. You have also crampons on your snowshoes and are not as much limited as touring-skis with skins on it (to an maximum angle of 30 degree). Keep also <strong>avalanche safety</strong> in mind and don't go for the steepest hills if the risk is increased.</p>

However there is the possibility that a slip on the ice will lead to sliding right off the edge of a cliff or steep drop.</p>

<p>My question then is, should we rope ourselves together so if one of us started sliding the other could ""self arrest"" by grabbing on to a tree, or even throwing ourselves in the deep snow? We will not have ice axes or climbing harnesses. I was picturing a bowline tied around each waist. Does this seem smart or does it seem like a way to guarantee both of us dieing if one were to fall? </p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>This is a bad plan for several reasons.</p>

<p>YakTrax are not well suited for this situation. YakTrax are more specialized for people who want to go running on city streets in places with cold winters. For mountaineering, they're basically useless. They don't give enough extra traction. Microspikes or crampons would be more appropriate.</p>

<p>Roping up is a specialized technique that is used, for example, when crossing a glacier that may have crevasses. It's not the best technique for the situation you're describing. For the situation you're describing, you should be carrying ice axes and know how to self-arrest. With your rope plan, if one of you falls, the other is unlikely to be able to self-arrest quickly and firmly enough. There is a technique called a running belay, but it's not a common, basic technique that you should be worrying about as a beginner.</p>

<p>When traveling in a rope team, normally people use climbing harnesses. It's true that mountaineers used to tie in to a rope without using a harness a hundred years ago. It's also true that there are ways of tying in to a rope in an emergency without a harness; you can find the technique (a diaper sling) described in Freedom of the Hills.

"Does drinking alcohol cause problems at altitude?","2054","","<p>If I'm going to be climbing a mountain, would drinking a small amount at altitude have any negative effects (besides general alcohol effects)?</p>
","<p>The effects of alcohol are exacerbated at altitude, each ounce of alcoholic beverage will have a greater perceived effect on the consumer. This is in part due to the lower oxygen level in the blood of anyone at altitude, usually this is most notable at or above 8,000ft. </p>

<p>There are some ways to mitigate the effects of alcohol, and speed recovery. </p>

<ol>
<li>Drink plenty of water: If you are at or above 8,000 feet and exercising heavily (ie. mountaineering, rock climbing, backcountry skiing) make sure to consume at least 72-128 ounces of water (2-4 liters) per day, more if in winter conditions or extreme heat. </li>
<li>Consume food with any alcohol use</li>
<li>Drink liquids containing sugar (hot tea with sugar is very popular)</li>
<li>Get appropriate sleep.</li>
</ol>

<p>Alcohol will cause several detrimental effects pertaining to climbing as well. </p>

<ol>
<li>Greater dehydration due to vasodilation.</li>
<li>Increased effects of altitude, again due to vasodilation. </li>
<li>Decreased perception of risk.</li>
<li>General decrease in mental decision making and judgement.</li>
<li>Decreased ability to digest food, and therefore lower overall energy for climbing. </li>
<li>Decreased temperature regulation, as the blood vessels in the skin are dilated and will release more body heat.</li>
</ol>

<p>This doesn't mean you shouldn't drink <strong>any</strong> alcohol on a climbing trip, but you must be aware of it's effects and how to deal with them. All-in-all, use moderation and good judgement. </p>

<p>Happy climbing!</p>

"Should I run if I come across Hyena?","2044","","<p>Question prompted by: <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/q/9674/2303"">Should I run if I see wild dogs?</a></p>

<p>Since Hyenas physically resemble Wild Dogs, more or less, is the advice in that discussion applicable for encounters with Hyenas too?</p>

<p>Are there any additional points?</p>
","<p><strong>stop</strong>, don't run away. As a predator, the hyena will instinctively chase animals which run away, even out of curiosity, so don't run away from it. Don't lie down or pretend to be dead - this will increase its curiosity. Try not to show your fear. Keep yourself calm by talking to it. </p>

<p>I think hyenas only hunt live prey when they are in packs, unless the prey is small. In the city they are probably scavenging for easy meals, not hunting in packs. If you are carrying any food, the hyena can probably smell it. Throw the food away and when the hyena shows interest in it move away slowly. The hyena is very lazy and prefers scavenging easy meals (eg dead meat) rather than chasing prey or fighting. But don't carry food as a precaution - this is asking for trouble! </p>

<p>Check to see if you are standing near rubbish bins or a tip or a dead animal. The hyena is probably more interested in these. Slowly move away to one side, keep facing the hyena. </p>

<p>If the hyena is showing interest in you personally and moves towards you, suddenly move a few steps towards it, to surprise it and make it think you are a predator. Spread out your arms, wave them about, make yourself as big as possible, make a loud noise, shout or scream threateningly, look aggressive and frightening, as if you are going to attack the hyena. </p>

<p>Most likely the hyena will run away. If not, vary your tactics - be still for a moment then make a sudden threatening movement or noise. If it growls or giggles, this is a sign that it is challenging your attack. In this case, stand your ground - never run away - but don't move any closer. If you are carrying a bag, swing it around your head. Or if you are carrying anything which will make a noise, use it to do so. Carrying a torch and/or a whistle or pepper spray is a good precaution - flash the torch in the animal's eyes, use spray when the animal is very close. If it moves closer, stamp your feet loudly at it, or throw something at it. </p>

<p>Don't move away until after the hyena does. When you do move, do it slowly, continuing to face the direction of the hyena. </p>

<p>If the hyena actually attacks you, stand your ground and fight back by poking with a stick or kicking and punching its head.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>Wool (...) does not melt or drip(.)</em></strong></p>
  
  <p>Wool ignites at a higher temperature than cotton and some synthetic
  fibers. It has a lower rate of flame spread, a lower rate of heat
  release, a lower heat of combustion, and does not melt or drip; it
  forms a char which is insulating and self-extinguishing, and it
  contributes less to toxic gases and smoke than other flooring products
  when used in carpets.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to Wool Gatherer, one thing that makes carded wool flame
  resistant is the fact that the fibers are so close together that they
  create an environment that is fairly devoid of oxygen thus resisting
  flame. An example of this idea, although one I have not personally
  tried and would not recommend, would be attempting to light a
  phonebook on fire. Apparently, it is not easy to light a phonebook on
  fire, as the pages are so tightly held together there is not enough
  oxygen present to support the flame.</p>

"Recommendations for two-way radios to use while skiing","2035","","<p>Going skiing with another family next year and looking for two-way radios to use so we can stay in touch. I've used cell phones in the past but that can get awkward (and since we are going to Canada it can also get expensive). </p>

<p>Ideal features would include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Good battery life</li>
<li>Usable in gloves/mitts</li>
<li>Water/snow resistant </li>
<li>Clear and loud communication</li>
<li>Good range</li>
</ul>

<p>Any recommendations?</p>
","<p>Presuming you do not have Amateur Radio licenses, or similar qualifications, you are then limited to various unlicensed options.</p>

<p>The answer will then vary by region, but as you mention Canada, your best bet will be to use the <strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Mobile_Radio_Service"">GMRS</a>/FRS</strong> (General Mobile Radio Service / Family Radio Service) which as basically replaced the old CB and walkie-talkie bands for local personal use. Note that FRS radios are freely usable cross-border; but GMRS regulations differ.  A license is required per family in the USA, and there are <em>base</em> stations available.  In Canada, no license is required at all, but GMRS power is restricted to two watts.</p>

<p>GMRS/FRS radios are readily available in Canada (and the USA) in almost any outdoors or electronics store, so you might want to pick them up before you go, and get used to them.  Options include chargers, headsets and other things.  Some have integrated GPS, but that adds to weight, reduces battery life, and might not be warranted.</p>

<p>Both work in the <strong>UHF</strong> band, which is more-or-less line-of-site, and definitely attenuated by ground or trees.  From the top of a ski hill to the bottom or over some general outdoor terrain, you should not have too much trouble.  Do <strong>not</strong> presume to use them as a primary emergency system, but for casual <em>where are you</em> they are likely the cheapest/best bet.</p>

Since they're fixed in the rock and used by everyone, I wonder, who is responsible to put them there and make sure they're secure? Are there regulations that need to be followed when placing them, e.g. minimum distance, stress tests, etc?</p>

I expected the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climbing_route"">Climbing route</a> article to also provide some information, but most of it is about the naming of the routes, rather than how their anchors (if any) are placed.</p>
","<p>There are two distinct styles of free rock climbing (with, as always, some grey areas). </p>

<p>In ""trad"" (= traditional) climbing, the team carries their own removable gear. The leader places protection points whilst climbing and the second climber removes them again. There might be the odd piece of permanent gear - pitons or bolts - but the climbing team is basically responsible for arranging their own protection.</p>

<p>In sport climbing, bolts are pre-placed by <em>somebody</em>, usually a local enthusiast or group of enthusiasts. How stuff is funded/maintained varies a lot from area to area, but it is almost always voluntary efforts of some kind. Formal standards don't exist, although most areas have best practices that are generally understood and adhered to by people putting in or maintaining fixed equipment. Exactly what these best practices are vary a lot from area to area depending on type of rock, proximity to salt water etc. IANAL, but from what I've read there might be some question of legal liability if people putting in fixed gear blatantly violate local best practices.</p>

<p>Bolt spacing norms in particular vary a lot from area to area. One of my local areas is the Frankenjura. There the locals generally bolt the routes so you won't hit the ground, but they don't care how scared you are. So you might be looking at doing hard climbing much further above a - solid - bolt than you are used to or comfortable with. A couple of hours in the opposite direction is Nassereith in Austria, where the bolt spacing makes some climbing gyms feel terrifying.

"Is belaying a lead more difficult than a top roped climber","2012","","<p><a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/q/17053/5330"">Assessing potential lead climbing partners for competence and safety</a> asserts that a lead climb belay is more complicated and has higher potential for a serious accident over a top rope belay.   </p>

<p>Is this the case?</p>

<p>Are top rope belays inherently simpler and  is the potential for a serious accident much lower than with a lead belay?</p>

<p>Further, in the context and risk of an entire climb, what part does the extra complexity (if any) of belaying a lead vs top roped climber play in the overall 
safety of climbers?</p>

<p>Note: I am interested specifically in the risks of the belay and not the inherent risk of top roping vs lead climbing. As this is about comparison to top rope, it's reasonable to exclude multi-pitch considerations from answers. </p>
","<p>Yes. No question.</p>

<p>With top-roping, the belayer can be spacing-out quite a bit and still do their job with a minimum of risk. With one hand on the belay tool, and another sensing the tension of the rope to the climber, you feel when there is some slack, then haul it in without even thinking. If the climber falls, it's rare the fall with be more than a foot or two.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the lead belayer has to be paying much more attention to what the climber is doing. Instead of hauling in the slack as in top-roping, in lead the rope is paid out as the climber ascends.</p>

<p>If the climber suddenly lunges upwards in top roping, faster than the belayer can haul it in, it's no big deal, there will be a little slack, and if they fall, they'll fall to about where they were before lunging, hardly cause for concern. Since the rope is paid out in lead, the belayer has to anticipate how much rope the climber will need. As a result, lead belayers maintain a fair amount of slack in the line. Few things are as demoralizing as making a complicated move while climbing, only to get yanked down because you've run out of slack and the belayer is slow to pay out. This especially can happen when the climber is trying to clip in, where the excess rope is the greatest, and therefore one of the most dangerous times to fall.</p>

<p>When a lead climber falls while climbing, they'll fall whatever the distance to the last anchor is, plus the slack. If the climber falls while struggling to clip in, they'll fall double the distance down to the last anchor. On many routes than can be several feet, equating to a drop of 6 feet or more, before the rope begins to tension. When it does, that can easily yank the belayer up off the ground, and the belayer must be anticipating it or they're going to be having a bad time. I've been climbing with a friend where he slipped while clipping in, and I was suddenly about 4 or 5 feet off the ground hanging off the wall by the time the two of us came to rest. That would not have gone well had I not been paying attention.</p>

<p>So as I am belaying, I must be watching what my partner is doing. When he is climbing, I keep the slack as low as I can without impeding his progress, and when he is ready I pay out more so he can bring the rope up to clip in, anticipate any trouble, then when he is successfully clipped in, haul in a bit of the slack in preparation for him to resume climbing. I have to be careful how much slack he has, as if I have too much near the bottom of the route for example, he could hit the deck, or me, before the rope even tensions. In outdoor climbing locations, varied terrain may present that hazard along the route, and in those situations I must communicate and coordinate the slack/speed relationship with the climber through those portions of the route. In top roping, I barely have to do any of that.</p>

<p>Additionally, as he is climbing, I must keep an eye on every time he clips in, to make sure he does it properly. When fatigued from a difficult climb, it could be easy to clip in backwards, for example. If a clip-in isn't done properly and he falls, the anchor could release, which obviously can be very dangerous. In top toping, I don't even have to look up at all while my partner is climbing.</p>

<p>Ropes are rated for a particular amount of falls at or above a given fall factor, after which the rope must be retired as it is no longer safe. If climbing exclusively top-roping, you will basically never approach a fall factor high enough to even bother thinking about whether it crossed the safety threshold. When lead climbing, that can happen on any route.</p>

"What is the strength of an ATC belay device when used in a guide mode/multi-pitch setup?","2011","","<p>Does anyone know the strength of an ATC when used in a multi-pitch set up? It occurred to me that the entire weight of a climber is resting on the strength of the ATC clip and not on any carabiner. I know it is not likely, but say if the belayer did not take in slack while the climber was climbing and took a large fall, how much force would be exerted on the ATC? </p>

<p>I've looked at Black Diamond, and Petzl, neither of which have KN ratings on their multi-pitch belay devices. Any clue why?</p>

<p>He pull tested an ATC in guide mode. Quick summary: the device itself doesn't fail or suffer damage. With a 10mm rope the ATC jams severely at 4.8 kN, breaks the rope at 9 kN. I don't know how to work out how much of a fall the second would have to take to get to 4.8 kN, but probably quite a bit; s/he certainly ain't getting to nine.</p>

<p>With an 8mm rope it's a little more alarming; device jams at 2 kN, locking fails at 4 kN. I imagine 2 kN would be pretty easy for a dropped follower to achieve, so anybody belaying two followers simultaneously on skinny double ropes evidently needs to pay attention.</p>

"What clothing or gear should I wear to prevent ticks?","1998","","<p>When I hunt grouse I usually wear waders to be able to cross small creeks and to not get my pants wet from dew. </p>

<p>My problem is though that I get a lot of junk collected in my waders, and specifically I'm concerned about ticks. </p>

<p>What should I wear to avoid this problem?</p>
","<p>Ticks can attach anywhere, in particular, they will find spots like the back of your knee, around waistbands, under armpits, undergarment straps or any other constricted place.</p>

<ol>
<li>Firstly, prefer to wear the clothing which is already treated for tick prevention by means of some tick repellent solution. The solution is supposed to contain <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permethrin"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Permethrin</a>. Spray shoes, boots, socks, pants, sleeves, gloves, kerchief, and hat. Keep the sprayed items away from your pets (if any) for their own safety. Insecticide and Pest control Products that contain Permethrin are only for spraying on clothes and gear and not to be sprayed on human/animal skin or any external use on the skin in diluted form either.
The wiki about Permethrin does say that Permethrin is used in medicines but that is in a different context from what is being discussed here.</li>
<li>Wear long pants. Preferably light-colored. That will make spotting a tick easy. It may look a bit odd, but do tuck pants into socks.</li>
<li>Wear long sleeved shirts. Tuck shirt into pants. This will prevent a tick from crawling under clothing. </li>
<li><p>Use the long socks with good elastic, or they may slip downwards exposing your skin. Else, you can tape them as shown in pic:</p>

<li><p>Wear a bandanna and/or hat to protect your neck and head.</p></li>

"What do life jacket ratings mean (Type I, Type II, etc)?","1993","","<p>Looking at flotation devices (life jackets) they are rated Type I, Type II, etc.  What do these rankings mean and what type should I by?</p>
","<p>There is already <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/a/11480"">an answer that gives the basics</a>, and this official page from the <a href=""http://www.uscg.mil/hq/cg5/cg5214/pfdselection.asp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Coast Guard</a> adds several details, so here is my summary.</p>

<p>The system of ratings for Personal Flotation Devices (PFDs) was developed jointly by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) and Underwriters Laboratory (UL) and has been in use for many decades. USCG had announced they were going to revise this system a couple years ago based on feedback from the public that they found the old system not understandable or useful.  There has been no update about when a new system will be released.</p>

<p>A Type I PFD is also called an off-shore life jacket.  It must provide at least 22 pounds (~100N) of buoyancy, must be able to keep an unconscious wearer face-up while in the water, must be reversible, and must be International Orange in color.  They are intended for use where rescue is likely to be delayed.  You will generally find them only on Naval and cruise ships, and are difficult to find in recreational boating stores.  When you do find them, they are a bit more expensive.</p>

<p>A Type II PFD is also call a near-shore buoyant vest.  It must provide at least 15.5 pounds (~70N) of buoyancy, and must be able to keep a conscious wearer in a vertical or face-up position in the water.  These are intended when rescue is likely to be quick.  They typically have a ""horse collar"" like appearance.  They may be any color but are most often made in orange.  These are very common and inexpensive, however most wearers find them uncomfortable for long-term use.</p>

<p>A Type III PFD is called a flotation aid.  Like a Type II, it must also provide 15.5 pounds (~70N) of buoyancy; however, there is no restriction on how this must be positioned (in other words, it might not help the wearer remain face-up.)  It is intended for use when rescue is likely to be almost immediate.  These come in many designs and colors- often specially made for the activity such as paddling, fishing, water skiing, etc.  They are the most comfortable to wear.</p>

<p>A Type IV PFD is a throwable device.  Ring buoys, seat cushions, and the collar buoys usually carried by sailboats are all Type IV.</p>

<p>A Type V PFD is a special-use device.  Typically, a Type V qualifies that same as one of the other wearable types but <em>only when worn.</em>  The full-body suits worn by the crews of fishing vessels are a good example.</p>

<p>Note that the buoyancy and turning requirements for inflatable types are more strict than for traditional (kapok or foam) types.</p>

<p>In the US, your vessel must carry one wearable (Type I, II, III, or V) for each person on board, that is properly fitted for that person.  You must also carry one Type IV for the entire vessel.  Each item must be in good condition and ""readily accessible"" (meaning not in a locker/ bag).</p>

"When is it unethical to dismantle a fire-ring?","1983","","<p>I've dismantled several fire-rings in an area that has many fire-rings strung out between a major trail and a river.  (Colorado, 8,500 feet).  These are not official camp sites.</p>

<p>Over the years, people decide to camp <strong>here</strong> rather than <strong>there</strong> even though a fire-ring was already <strong>there</strong>. Then they build a very large fire-ring, which is left brimming with ash, partially burned wood and unburnables such as aluminium foil and smashed cans.  I'll dismantle one of these on my way out, tidy up the site, and carry out as much debris as I can.</p>

<p>Any hypothermic person can easily find another fire-ring.  Most of these fire-rings are old, although still seen as an opportunity for a big campfire. I wouldn't dismantle an isolated fire-ring near timberline. Ethics?</p>
","<p>Different land managers have different takes on this so I don't think you're going to get a solid answer that applies across all areas. </p>

<p>I generally use the term ""trail camp"" to describe what you're talking about. An area with up turned rocks for sitting and doing stuff on, a fire ring, some flat spots for sleeping, etc.</p>

<p>I've never dismantled a single one, personally. I have a part time guide business, and one of the rules for us (US National Parks and US National Forests) is that our groups need to spread out across multiple campsites when possible. So if we have a party of ten with two guides, we'll break into two groups of five with a guide each and use two campsites.</p>

<p>So while you might be looking at things through a lens of ""one group can just use x instead of y"", there are groups that need to use both x and y on occasion.</p>

<p>Equestrian groups have even weirder requirements but I don't really know about those, other than the simple math that they have big animals that need to go somewhere and the people need to be a bit (but not too far) away.</p>

<p>For whatever it's worth, even in areas where fires are allowed we rarely start them. Under a commercial permit we're required to use existing trail camps whenever possible. </p>

"What is the best material to make an outdoor shelter roof out of?","1975","","<p>Say you are caught out without a tent in mild temperature conditions, e.g. moorland/woods.  What material would you look for to make a good shelter roof out of? </p>
","<p>The same way that modern houses aren't made out of only one material (in most places), your shelter should be made up of different materials as well. Obviously this all depends on where you are and what is available. Primarily you'll need two types of materials. (I'll assume you're in a fairly standard deciduous forest):</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Structure:</strong> You'll want to use sturdy, thick wood to build the structure of your shelter. You're going to be piling on a significant amount of loft and protection, and you don't want the whole thing collapsing on you in your sleep.</p>

<p>I think the general recommendation here is to find a large branch or log around 10 feet long, and prop it up in the fork of a tree. You'll then prop up smaller branches or large sticks along both sides of that main branch to create a wedge-shaped frame for your structure, <a href=""http://www.natureskills.com/survival/primitive-shelter/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">as seen in the first image below</a>:</p></li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2IaJn.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Insulation &amp; Protection:</strong> The next step is adding loft to help insulate your shelter and offer basic wind and rain protection. Basically, just grab arm-fulls of the small sticks, leaves and other debris that are all over the forest floor and pile them on your structure. It can be tricky to get them to stay on top without sliding off the side or falling between the branches, so start around the base and build your way up. Patience is a key part of this. Trash bags can be useful for this, if you have them.</p>

<p>Depending on how cold it is and what the conditions are like, you should try to have 2-3 feet of loft covering your structure, as seen in the second image, above. You want it to be thick, but matted down so that it doesn't all blow away while you're sleeping. 2-3 feet of loft might sound like a lot, but you'll want as much as you can get to ensure you stay warm and dry.</p></li>

"Mountaineering / glacial traverse: rope-up or go it alone?","1971","","<p>When crossing a glacier (or other mountaineering activity for that matter) I've heard that roping everyone together without having a fixed anchor is falling out of fashion since more often than not if someone takes a tumble into a crevasse then end up pulling their partner(s) in with them. What is the current expert advice? Is it better to tie everyone together, or keep the rope handily unattached and ready to perform a rescue if someone goes in?</p>
","<p>If you have some credible people saying not to be roped up, I'd love to see it, because that sounds completely insane to me. Here's why:</p>

<p>If you are traveling on a glacier without being roped up, there is a very, very, very good chance that you will die if you fall in a crevasse. This isn't because you vanish into nowhere, but because you will get what we morbidly call ""corked"" - you will get squished between the two sides and get stuck, most likely sustaining massive injuries on the way. To compound the issue, a rescue in this case can be nearly impossible to an average group for several reasons. First, access to a person's harness or other attachment points will be limited. Second, if you are so far down as to be stuck, rope length becomes a serious potential issue. Third, close contact with ice for a long period is a major hypothermia risk.</p>

<p>Good training, practice, and technique makes the risk of dragging in partners very low, and the potential gain of being able to rescue someone very high. Keeping a good number of people on a team is also helpful (two people is an obvious minimum, but three or four is better if you have them). I suppose I can imagine situations where a very poorly prepared group wouldn't rope up, but that should be avoided from the very beginning.</p>

<p>This isn't to say that it doesn't happen. A very good friend of mine, Jim Davidson, recently wrote a book about his experience on Rainier, where he fell into a crevasse, dragging his partner with him. His partner and dear friend, Mike Price, died in the accident, and Jim managed to climb his way out by the skin of his teeth (the book is called <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0345523199"">The Ledge</a>).</p>

<p>So what this boils down to is that yes, as a rope team you risk accidents that involve more than just the first person to fall. Those risks can be minimized and managed carefully, but they never go away entirely. Training, experience, practice, and good equipment are all necessary to avoid those situations.</p>

","<p>Having been in the same situation and tried various scenarios, I've found the best way for hanging my boots is to keep a carabiner with me. I hook it on the loops on the back of my boots and hang that from the straps that I'm using to suspend my hammock. Depending on the weather I also do the same thing with my pack. The straps I use have loops in them. If they don't, you can just tie a loop in and use another carabiner to hang your pack from the rope. </p>

<p>There's no real hard and fast rule of course and some people's strategies may differ.

"Surviving a forest fire by starting another fire","1908","","<p>Awhile back I heard on CBC radio about a man who got trapped in a forest fire (surrounded on all sides) and survived. The way he survived was so ridiculous that he was brought to court and almost fined/put in jail: <strong>He fought the fire with another fire.</strong></p>

<p>He was in the thick bush with white hot fire closing in the distance. He lit a tree on fire where he was and let it spread. He hit the floor and let his fire blackened all the surrounding trees. Afterwards when the <strong>real</strong> fire was approaching, it couldn't get to him because of his pocket of burnt trees.</p>

<p>The man claimed back in the day, this was common knowledge.</p>

<p>Does this have any validity / is this the thing to do if surrounded by a forest fire ?</p>
","<p>This does have a basis in a known technique, <em>back burning</em>, but by your description the application wasn't orthodox.</p>

<p>From <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_burn#Back_burning"">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Back burning is a way of reducing the amount of flammable material
  during a bushfire by starting small fires along a man made or natural
  firebreak in front of a main fire front. It is called back burning
  because the small fires are designed to 'burn back towards the main
  fire front'. The basic reason for back burning is so that there is
  little material that can burn when the main fire reaches the burnt
  area. The firebreaks that may be used to start a line of fires along
  could be a river, road or a bulldozed clearing etc.</p>

"Compass compatibility: Can I use my US compass in Australia?","1907","","<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>I bought my compass in the US last year. Next week I'm going to travel to Australia.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Is my US-compass compatible with Australia? or do I need a special compass?</li>
<li>Do I need an adapter?</li>
</ul>
","<p>I double checked a couple of websites (thanks a lot for the comments to the question) and I'm sure that my compass is not compatible with Australia.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a result of these magnetic variances, the compass industry has divided the earth into 5 ""zones"", as identified in the map which shows the different zones starting with Zone 1 at the top and ending with Zone 5 at the bottom (Australia and New Zealand only).   <strong>All of the standard compasses sold at New Zealand are balanced for Zone 5.</strong></p>
  
  <p>A typical feature for regular compasses is that they can function without problems only at limited longitudes because the changes in the magnetic field affect the position of the needle. For fast needles, this phenomenon is even more prominent.</p>
  
  <p>Source: <a href=""http://www.mapworld.co.nz/global.html"">MapWorld</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As well Wikipedia suggests that my compass is not working in Australia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because the Earth's magnetic field's inclination and intensity vary at different latitudes, compasses are often balanced during manufacture so that the dial or needle will be level, eliminating needle drag which can give inaccurate readings. Most manufacturers balance their compass needles for one of five zones, ranging from zone 1, covering most of the Northern Hemisphere, to zone 5 covering Australia and the southern oceans. <strong>This individual zone balancing prevents excessive dipping of one end of the needle which can cause the compass card to stick and give false readings.</strong></p>
  
  <p>Source: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass"">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Therefore the answer is:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Compasses purchased in Europe or the US cannot be used in Australia.</li>
<li>There are models available with a ""world needle"" which work around the world.</li>

"Should I be more careful about postholing during winter hikes?","1906","","<p>This weekend I am going to do one of my favorite things: winter hiking in the Sierras. When I say ""hiking"", I mean that though we might be trodding up a mountain in the snow, it is not real mountaineering.  I won't wear plastic boots and probably won't use my ice axe.</p>

<p>I have always loved hiking in the snow. And I have always considered postholing while hiking to be a minor annoyance. But what are the real risks? Do people break their legs postholing through the snow? Should I always wear snowshoes if postholing is likely? Or is this just the minor annoyance I think of it as?</p>
","<p>This is really up to you, but <i>I</i> think if postholing is enough of a issue it would be good to wear snowshoes.  If nothing else, it just makes things easier.</p>

<p>One problem of postholing can be sometimes difficulty in getting out.  You're not likely to actually get hurt, because ""falling"" onto the snow isn't a problem when it's deep and soft enough for your foot to punch thru enough to call it postholing.</p>

<p>I was on a hike once in the Green Mountains of Vermont where I had intended to take snowshoes but they accidentally got left behind.  Things were OK for a while, but then the terrain changed and drifts were getting deeper.  I got into a major posthole where there would have been a small stream crossing the trail in the summer.  The stream was completely covered up, so the only clue was the depression in the topography.  This somehow created air spaces or made for looser snow so that I ended up with my right leg sunk all the way into the snow up to my hips.  At that point my left leg was sortof kneeling, except partially sunk in the snow too.</p>

<p>Getting out of that was more difficult than I would ever have imagined if someone had only told me about it.  I was by myself, so nobody to throw a stick or grab my shoulders or something.  Trying to lean forwards to get more horizontal didn't work well because my whole body sank into the very loose snow, but my right foot was still stuck in something more dense down there.  I eventually got out of that trap, but it probably took a few minutes.</p>

<p>This would have been far less of a problem with snowshoes on.</p>

"Taking Aspirin in higher altitudes","1900","","<p>Reading <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/a/1228/2653"">this answer</a> and especially the comments leads me to questions: </p>

<ul>
<li>Should one use Aspirin in high altitudes? </li>
<li>Should one use it as a precaution or only when actually getting headache or other problems?</li>
</ul>

<p>I heard that the decreasing oxygen level in the blood will cause the body to produce more (and bigger) red blood cells if you acclimate properly. This thickens the blood, to get it thinner a drug like Aspirin could be used. But also drinking a lot helps. Still, disguising headache and therefore the major sign of acute mountain sickness (AMS) might be a drawback.</p>

<p>I know this is a general question about medicine which is difficult to answer without doctors and for the specific person of interest. Still, I would like to know the pros and cons of Aspirin in high-altitude or in general the influence and consequences for mountaineering.</p>
","<p>First I want to make clear, that I do not have professional medical training. Everything I am going to write down, I acquired by reading articles published by various high-altitude medicine societies. As the question is pretty broad, this answer will certainly not cover all involved aspects, but I will do my best to give some information.</p>

<p>While Aspirin is widely used, it is not unproblematic. Contrary to popular believe, it is not directly blood thinning, but it inhibits blood coagulation. In case of an injury, it can prolong the bleeding. Especially for internal injuries this can be very dangerous, as these are very hard to recognize.</p>

<p>For high altitude headaches, Ibuprofen is considered more effective than Aspirin and can thus potentially substitute it.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Aspirin in high dosage can interact dangerously with Diamox. So it is certainly not advisable to use both as precaution (but your doctor would not administer that anyway).</p>

<p>Due to this factors, the use of Aspirin should not be taken lightly especially in high dosage. If you need precautionary measures for high-altitude, consult a doctor for proper medication. I would not recommend taking Aspirin regularly. If you do take it in the field for headaches or anything, be very careful about bleeding injuries. </p>

"Where does the name Deadman come from in mountaineering gear?","1900","","<p>Why is a <a href=""http://dmmclimbing.com/products/deadman/"" rel=""nofollow"">Deadman</a> called so? Where does the name come from?</p>
","<p>imsodin's explanation (it's a heavy object you bury in the ground, like a dead body) seems very plausible. Just to add some history to it, here's the earliest use of the term listed in the <em>Oxford English Dictionary:</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a1852 W. T. Spurdens <em>Forby's Vocab. E. Anglia</em> (1858) III. 12 <em>Deadman</em>, a piece of timber buried in the earth, to secure posts, or other timbers by.</p>

<p>The next recorded usage is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1901 <em>Daily Colonist</em> (Victoria, Brit. Columbia) 15 Oct. 5/4 A deck hand..was killed by being struck on the head by a ‘dead man’, which is a post imbedded on a [river gravel] bar to haul the steamer over.</p>

<p>So the term has existed in agricultural and nautical contexts for some time (and when you're burying something in earth rather than snow, the connection with burying a body is a little more obvious).</p>

"How to calculate backpacking food requirements for a dog","1882","","<p>So I know how to calculate how many additional calories a day I need while backpacking. My question is how do I calculate how much food my dog will need while backpacking. </p>

<p>I'm hoping for a general equation based on how much a dog eats in a regular day, but I'll provide specific information about my situation in case that is needed to tailor responses.</p>

<p>My dog is now 10 months old and 40 pounds, I plan to wait until she is at least 1-1/2 years old to take overnight, and she shouldn't be much bigger than she is now. I've been working her up from distances of 1 mile around 5 months old up to 8 miles now. I don't have her carry any weight yet but I do hope to eventually for overnight trips. Her breed is mostly <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Dog"">Carolina Dog</a>.</p>
","<p>Do you make your own dog food or purchase bagged food in the store? Either way, an idea would be to use puppy or performance good as they're both higher in caloric value, nutritional content and are easier to digest than regular dog food.  </p>

<p>The actual amount of food you feed really depends on your dog.  How has she handled the shorter hikes?  Have you noticed an increase or decrease in appetite during and directly after the hikes? How she responds to the shorter hikes will help indicate how she'll handle the longer, overnight trip.</p>

<p>You may want to try out the dog food calculator here: <a href=""http://www.dogfoodadvisor.com/dog-feeding-tips/dog-food-calculator/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Dog Food Calculator</a>.</p>

<p>It's a nice way to compare her current calorie needs to the calculator results then, compare them to the results for increased activity. Depending on how active your dog is now versus how much she'll do on the trail her caloric needs may be just slightly elevated to doubled, which is another good reason to monitor her on the shorter hikes.</p>

<p>And, in relation to your question dogs have a carnivorous bias while having an omnivorous ability, meaning they are designed to eat meat but can handle me plant material.  Feeding a grain-free diet will help limit the amount of food you will need to carry for her because grain-free food has a greater protein content, is more calorie dense and more easily digestible.</p>

<p>While you didn't actually ask this dogs are susceptible to giardia protozoa, like humans, so you will need to filter or treat her water too.  </p>

<p>Some people will use the term aggressive to mean tighter as well, but I have seen that to be less common. You want your shoes to be crazy tight, regardless of their shape. Also, the more aggressive the shoe, usually the longer break in period and the more painful.</p>

<p>This shoe is tilted but you can see the bottom is pretty flat. It is ""non-aggressive""

<p>More specifically: When I started climbing I mostly focused on the hands. After some months, I advanced in the grades, but I started to fail in certain climbs because I slipped from the foot holes. During the time I realized the first time that I had bad footwork - so I started to train it.</p>

","<p>The mistakes I mention might be more common at lower grades than yours, here goes anyway:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Too big steps. When I started climbing I tended to make massive steps, leaving out many good footholds in between.

<li><p>Not planning a couple of steps ahead. A beginners mistake is to locate the next good hole, then place whatever foot's most convenient (usually not the one you moved last) without thinking about how to carry on from there, leading to an inelegant ""hop"" as you switch feet on a little hold so you have the right one free to carry on. Another tip from a friend: think about which foot you would like free when you're in a particular hold, not which foot is easiest to place there.</p></li>

<p>Could you validate this opinion (only in terms of longer, i.e. lasting 30 days or more, tips)? Are there any (possible) health-related negative effects of freeze-dried food one should be aware of? </p>
","<p>Generally there are no known health side effects to eating mostly or only freeze-dried food.</p>

<p>Freeze-dried food tends to hold more nutrients, and hold them longer, than most other shelf-life extending approaches. Freeze-dried fruits hold nearly the same amount of vitamins and antioxidants as their fresh equivalent. Freeze-dried food also does not need to have preservatives which have debatable negative effects (depending on type and quantity). Additionally, food preserved by freeze-drying stays nutritious for longer than any other approach (much longer than some).</p>

<p>Many commercial makers of freeze-dried food add a ton of sodium, but that is not part of the freeze-drying process. Some manufacturers are better than others.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for those concerned about the environment, the process of freeze-drying is much more energy intensive than other preservation methods.</p>

"Outrigger and/or leeboard when sailing a canoe?","1876","","<p>I have been considering adding a sail to my open 17 foot Coleman canoe.  Browsing images on the internet show pretty much every imaginable configuration but they all share 3 or 4 combinations of outrigger and/or leeboard.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Neither, typically seen with small sails and or low budget rigs going down wind only.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outrigger"" rel=""nofollow"">Outrigger</a> only, typically seen on canoes with and without sails.</p></li>

<li><p>Outrigger and leeboard, occasionally seen in all ranges.  Seems to be the least photographed and posted option. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>On browsing the web, everyone seems to think their choice is the best, so I am having difficulty assessing the pro and cons of each choice.  What should I consider when designing my canoe sailing solution as it relates to outriggers and leeboards?</p>

<p>My current plans are limited to inland water ways (rivers) but you never know where the next adventure will take you so, considerations for all types of water would be appreciated. </p>
","<p>The right way to view the pros and cons is to understand the basic mechanics of how a sailboat works, so you can decide what's appropriate for your situation. </p>

<p>The first thing to be aware of is that unless you only ever sail straight downwind, then sails don't work like parachutes, they work like airplane wings. The motion of the air over the shape of the sail generates a force which can be used to propel the boat. In addition to that force generated, the air generates two forces that must be resisted: the force of the wind trying to blow the sail over and heel or capsize the boat, and the force to push the boat sideways.</p>

<p>Resisting the sidways force is addressed in most boats with a hydrodynamic element called a keel, which shares the same name as the structural element of the boat, and includes weighted keels, centerboards, daggarboards, leeboards, and others. Leeboards are popular with sailing canoes, because they don't requite much if any special built provisions in the canoe, and they don't increase the draft of the boat.</p>

<p>Resisting the heeling force is usually handled by ballasting the boat, either lead in a fin keel, water ballast in trailerable weekender type sailboats, or the body mass of the crew on smaller boats. On many small racing sailboats, the crew of the boat hangs out off the edge of the windward side to balance the powerful force of the air on the sails. As canoes are not really meant to handle sideways loads and can easily tip, this makes an outrigger of some sort usually necessary.</p>

<p>Now, you could make an outrigger to address both those forces, by designing one with a shape to resist the lateral motion. This can work, and there are boats that have that, such as a Hobie 16 which has no daggerboards and instead has asymmetric hulls, but there are some trade-offs. The shape has a less than ideal cross section for buoyancy, so it will have greater drag than a 'plain' outrigger and a centerboard. Additionally, they will be much more difficult to turn than the alternative. The Hobie 16 example, turns very poorly compared to other sailboats. However, in the case of the Hobie 16, both of those trade-offs are worth it because the lack of centerboards means you can ride right up onto the beach without risking damage to your boat if you don't pull up the boards in time.</p>

<p>In this image of a racing Hobie 16, you can see the crew trapezed out to control the heel of the boat, and you can see the shape of the hull, it's nearly flat facing the water, to resist the sideways force of the wind. The other hull in the water is a mirror image of the starboard hull.
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/oPnl4.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/oPnl4.jpg"" alt=""Hobie 16""></a></p>

<p>Ultimately, every element of boat design is a trade-off of some sort. As you make adjustments for better and better sailing performance, your result will start looking less and less like a canoe and more like a traditional sailing boat. Only you can decide where there right balance is.</p>

I've been getting quite a few scrapes on the knees working certain routes, or from falling.  I'm climbing at an indoor gym wearing shorts.  Some people climb in long pants, but many don't.  It's not a big deal, but I wonder if this is mainly a technique issue which will go away over time, or if there's some knee protection available that wouldn't reduce flexibility.</p>
","<p>It doesn't <em>really</em> go away with time.  At least not for me - when I'm on a hard gym route I tend to ignore any holds that are ""off"" for that route, and every now and then I'll hit one with an elbow or knee.  Also outside, while you want to emphasize using your feet, ever now and then you'll find yourself needing to place a knee on a hold.

"Using a rope ""Alpine Style""/Moving together","1872","","<p>I've seen people using a ropes ""alpine style"" in the past but I'm not sure on the specifics.</p>

<p>By <em>alpine style</em> I mean where the rope is coiled around the body and attached to a second of third person. Anchors may or may not be used but typically the people move together. The idea being that all people in the party are ""roped"" up. You'd use it when moving together on unsure ground (not necessarily when climbing) I'm pretty sure you need to add a knot into the system somewhere, so if someone falls it doesn't just tighten. </p>

<li>How do you set the rope up?</li>
<li>What knot to use on the coil?</li>
<li>How much slack should you use?</li>
<li>Taking in and giving slack?</li>
</ul>

<p>Possibly give me the correct name for this type of rope work?</p>
","<p>Firstly, the technique you describe is actually called ""Moving together"" at least by British climbers. The technique is used to move rapidly on relatively easy ground while also providing a degree of protection from falls. It is also used to rope up while crossing glaciers.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.rockclimbingcompany.co.uk/Technical-Information/Rope-Coils-Scrambling.html"">This website</a> has a good set of photos showing how to attach the rope to your harness and coil it around the body. The knot is a simple overhand knot which is tied around the coils and clipped to a carabiner clipped to the loop formed at the rope's attachment poin to the harness.</p>

<p>As to the distance to keep between climbers, that depends on the terrain. <a href=""https://www.thebmc.co.uk/climb-skills-moving-together"">This page on the British Mountaineering Council's website</a> gives a description of what sort of distances to keep between roped climbers while moving together. </p>

<p>You can change this distance by ""taking in coils"" either for a long period by untying the knot and letting out coils or adding coils around the body or if only for a short distance, maybe on easier ground between more tricky parts, by simply taking in a few coils and holding onto them in your hand (usually the climber in the rear would do this).</p>

<p>While moving together on say a rock ridge, the climber in front can place the rope alternately behind any spikes or flakes and the other climber than removes the rope from the spikes or flakes. You could also place the odd piece of artificial protection in the same way. As the ground should be relatively easy, the distance between these running belays need not be close together.</p>

<p>The reason for this technique is that it is much quicker than ""pitching"" a climb in the normal way but still provides some protection on the event of a fall.</p>

"Solo-backpacking in mountain lion country","1870","","<p>I've read that to take precautions in mountain lion country, people should hike and camp in groups.</p>

<p>Does that mean solo-backpacking is not advisable in mountain lion country (Rocky Mountains in my case)?</p>
","<p>I can think of many reasons why solo-backpacking wouldn't be <em>advisable</em>, but cougars isn't one of them.</p>

<p>I'm not saying cougar attacks don't happen, last summer there was a incident in Waterton National Park close to home here, <a href=""http://calgary.ctvnews.ca/cougar-menaces-hikers-in-waterton-lakes-national-park-1.1977383"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a cougar was menacing hikers</a> along a popular trail, and even attacked a teenage girl that was part of a group.  </p>

<p>Cougar attacks are very uncommon, and typically only occur when a cougar is sick, injured, or old and frail, and even then they usually target easy prey, like slow fat dogs, though they have been known to go after children that are a distance away from their parents. In the incident with the teenage girl, the ranger that shot the cat said that it was acting very unusual, and appeared to be disturbed. Pretty much all cat encounters have a similar story, but 99.9% of the time, aside from finding foot prints, it's highly unlikely that you will ever find a trace of one.</p>

<p>I grew up in a small mountain town in the Rockies, when I was 9 years old there were 3 adult cougars roaming around town preying on peoples pets. Before the cats were caught and relocated, rangers visited our school and taught us how to stay safe, avoid cougar attacks, and how to defend ourselves if we were ever attacked (a futile effort by the way, but I totally thought I was a trained lion wrestler after that session). There are tonnes of cougars where I'm from (South of Banff National Park) but to be honest, <em>I've never seen on in the wild in my entire life</em>, and I grew up roaming their territory.</p>

<p>They are out there—my brother went out one day with a friends dad who has hounds for cougar hunting, and he said they were able to tree one in no more than 10 minutes—but cougars are very secretive, and will go out of their way to avoid human contact, so you don't have to worry about them, they're the last thing on my mind when I'm out in the woods.</p>

<p>The only time you would ever need to worry about a normal cougar, is if you were crashing around in the woods and stumbled upon a shallowly buried deer carcass. When cougars kill large game they will bury what they don't eat to save it for later, and they will get defensive if you approach their cache, so just leave it alone and get away from it. </p>

<p>For as much as encountering wildlife is a concern while backpacking solo, the greatest danger is silence, the odds of creeping up on a predator are a lot better when you're not having a conversation with anyone, so talk to yourself or sing while you walk, if a cougar hears you coming, it'll get off the trail long before you get near it. I guess if you were a really petite person you might have some reason to worry, I've heard stories of women getting jumped while jogging, but one thing that's going to deter a cougar from attacking you is your backpack, it makes you look bigger than you are, which is intimidating for large cats. </p>

<p>If you're worried about it, one of the best defenses you can have against a cougar attack is actually a taser. An inventor from California actually <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3INLDm2ryY"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">designed a taser</a> specifically for defense against cougars, it's called the <a href=""http://www.armstar.net/armstar-bodyguard-sport/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Armstar Bodyguard</a>, and it's pretty dang sweet if you ask me: </p>

<p>His idea quickly made it's way into the defense and security market, but he's still trying to get the sport model he originally envisioned (pictured above) out into the consumer market.</p>

"Am I likely to need multiple pairs of boots on the Appalachian Trail?","1867","","<p>Reading up on a hiking boot size question, I came across <a href=""http://www.rei.com/product/789686/lowa-renegade-ii-gtx-mid-hiking-boots-mens"">this review</a> from Silver Spring, Maryland for a wide hiking boot.</p>

<p>This boot has a ""lifespan"" of 400 miles.  Is that typical of a hiking boot?  Since the Appalachian Trail (AT) is over 2,000 miles long, should I expect one or more pairs of boots to wear out and become unusable during the course of a through-hike?  </p>

<p>Also, if my feet do change size over the course of the hike-- or if a pair of shoes does wear out-- how do I get a new, better-fitted pair while on the trail?</p>
","<ul>
<li>Do boots really last (only) 400 miles?</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, yes.  If you are a hard-man/woman, you might stretch one pair of boots to half the AT.  Normal people go through quite a few pairs - I used 10-ish pairs of trail runners on the PCT (Pacific Crest Trail), partially because my feet grew 2 sizes and I didn't realize that was why I was suddenly getting blisters from my previously comfortable shoes.  So if you know what's up, I think 6-8 pairs for the AT would be reasonable.  Boots last a bit longer (as Kevin said, 400 miles maybe), so you might only need 4-5 pairs.  </p>

<p>The trouble with boots in that situation is that you generally need to break them in, and a large number of thru-hikers end up with bigger feet within a few hundred miles of starting.  So, you can't really buy ahead until you know whether you are the ""feet grow"" or ""feet don't grow"" type of person.  Thus, using runners is pretty normal - they wear out faster but don't need breaking in.</p>

<ul>
<li>Logistically, how do you get more boots as you hike?</li>
</ul>

<p>On the AT, because of it's popularity, you should be able to identify some gear/shoe stores around the 200-400 miles-in corridor where you could go to try on more boots in a variety of sizes.  Alternatively, and what I've done many times, is to only buy one pair before you start hiking.  </p>

<p>If your feet stay the same size for the first month, you are probably safe, so have someone at home buy enough pairs for the rest of the trail, and mail them to you via General Delivery at post offices along the trail.  </p>

<p>If your feet change sizes, and continue to change, order a range of sizes-widths via the internet (or someone at home) and again, have them delivered via a Post Office.  Return all pairs that don't fit.  Big sites like Zappos.com will do this no problem (including delivering to post offices and free returns).  So once you establish your new size, you walk another 300 miles in your new boots, then order the next pair to the next PO you'll reach.  Repeat until done :)</p>

"Roof rack system suitable for both bicycle and kayak?","1864","","<p>My wife &amp; I are just getting into (non-sea/ocean) kayaking and biking, and we're thinking about ways to transport our equipment on our car.</p>

<p>My guess is that once a pair of cross-bars are set up on a car roof, it would be possible to use it to handle both 2 bikes and 2 kayaks (although obviously, not at the same time -- either 2 bikes or 2 kayaks at one time).  We will be bicycling more often than kayaking, and will be doing this for recreation..., so we're not looking for a serious (expensive or complicated) solution.</p>

<p>Is this accurate?  What do I need to take into consideration?  How difficult is it to swap out mounting hardware for roof racks?  What are better alternatives?</p>
","<p>Kayaks can easily be strapped down to cross bars. Sometimes J bars or uprights are used to put the boats on their sides allowing more to fit without stacking them. Bike racks for roof bars are quite quick to fit/remove but you shouldn't need to if you get them right and you car is wide enough. </p>

<p>You might even be able to strap the boats on their sides to the bike racks. I've seen racks that would do that (they were the sort with a front skewer so you take the wheel off ) and racks that wouldn't. </p>

<p>A reasonably wide car could take two bikes (perhaps one facing forwards and one backwards) and two kayaks either on their side with uprights or one on top of the other,  all at the same time. If you do stack the boats be extra careful about securing them and checking that straps don't loosen - I suggest an extra strap/rope/cable lock attaching the end loops of the boats to the roof rack. </p>

"What to do if a team member falls sick?","1860","","<p>Recently I fell ill whilst car camping and it made me consider the situations when not around amenities. In addition to this I recently was part of a four man, one dog team climbing Snowdon and one of us fell ill with a severe migraine, and we carried on despite the migraine as the team member wished to do so, which also got me thinking. </p>

<p>Obviously there is only so far the common sense and opinion of someone who is unwell can be taken before someone has to step in for the sake of their safety, and I understand <em>obviously some sicknesses are more serious than others</em> but I would assume it is better to stop in the location you are in, or slow your trek down with plenty of rests. If you are in a large group, meals and toilet areas would I assume also become a problem if you are in an area for a while.</p>

<p>If a member of your team falls sick mid-trek, and you are rather far from the closest amenity, what is the best cause of action to ensure the safety of the individual as well as the team? </p>

<p><strong>Are there any essential practises that the team leader / first aider should consider?</strong></p>
","<p>Decide depending upon the impact that person has on the group and the event.
If he/she is a crucial member to keep going, may be the group should agree to call it off, and decide to turn back or set up a camp, depending upon the supplies and the location.
You'd never want to make someone walk back home is he/she is really in not a shape to sustain the exertion.</p>

<ol>
<li>Check what dependencies the group have over him/her and make a group decision if He/She can rest and be accompanied by one of the members (preferably the most experienced member), while other go on and come back in a few hours. For a multi-day hike, I'd recommend sticking together, no-one goes ahead, either rest or turn back.</li>
<li>If its something like Diarrhea and/or Vomit, Inquire if He/She has drunk and/or ate from unhygienic sources. Food poisoning can get worst by every passing hour. Sometimes sun stroke can also cause similar symptoms. Whatever the reason, everybody turning back and getting to the nearest medical center should be a wise, sensible and obvious decision to make.</li>
<li>If its something like Migraine or bad headache, inquire if He/She has been struggling with Acrophobia or similar issues while exerting at higher grounds. If its a casual Headache/Migraine, then may be He/She can be accompanied by someone wiser and rest in the tent <em>(if the group has brought along)</em>, a mountain hut or some safe place, preferably sheltered <em>(considering if its rains)</em>.</li>
<li>If He/She is still able walk neatly, group should consider asking him/her to walk down to the car with someone wiser accompanying him/her. That shall be the safest place to rest.</li>
<li>Inquire if He/She has some sort of a reaction from general medicines like Metronidazole, Domperidone, Aspirin, Amoxicillin, etc. Out of these, Amoxicillin is an irregular member in the bunch of medicines known generally. Its used to treat a wide variety of bacterial infections. I always keep it with me, just in case. One should also consider a fact that overdose of Amoxicillin can cause Diarrhea.
If that is not an issue, you can consider giving him/her the required and suitable pill. <em>(I assume, if you have them in the Medical Kit at first place, you are expected to have general information about dosage)</em>. Its usually advised to sit back and rest after you take some medicine.</li>
<li>In case of Fever, its not out-of-the-blue, the symptoms can be observed before the mercury rises. In such a case, its a wise call to turn back.</li>
<li>If its a multi-day hike, and if someone starts suffering from Diarrhea or Vomit, you should ensure that the person is kept Hydrated and if possible consider starting towards nearest medical facility. Just a side tip: I have observed that eating apples helps to at least control Diarrhea.</li>
<li>If someone gets bad migraine on a multi-day hike, you can consider camping immediately rather than making him/her walk further.</li>
</ol>

<p>On a multi-day hike its very much possible that you have to stay, and you can't just turn back and go home. Spending a night in such a case is really difficult for the person as well the ones who care for him/her.</p>

<p><strong>1. If its Diarrhea:</strong> Diarrhea is one of the common things that can screw your trek. Keep the poor fellow hydrated with water and Pedialyte, Rehydralyte or similar products which are available without prescription. Give him/her fruit juice (asynthetic, without pulp), broth, soda. Do not give him/her milk and milk-made products. Roasted/Boiled Potatoes are good to eat. Just keep in mind that too much of salt or sugar can aggravate Diarrhoea. If you have Oranges with you, then that is a good food to eat since they are loaded with vitamin C and believed to aid in digestion. Keeping something warm on the belly may also help relieve abdominal cramps. May be a collapsible hydration pack filled with lukewarm water?<br>
Diarrhea is <em>mostly</em> non-contagious, so its totally okay that the carer shares the tent with the one who is suffering. </p>

<p><strong>2. If its Fever:</strong> Elevated temperature, pulse, and breathing rate; chills or hot flashes, sometimes flushed skin, headache are symptoms of Fever. Make him/her wear light clothing and keep the bedding light. Medicines like Paracetamol, Ibuprofen relieve pain and reduce fever. I'd personally not consider taking both of them at the same time. Measure his/her body temperature regularly, if its getting higher, sponge him/her with cold water. Keep him/her hydrated. Abrupt fevers are mostly due to climatic changes. So being a caring person I wouldn't hesitate sitting by him/her in the same tent and keep the person calm, but that is absolutely personal opinion. Just in case if you are not ready to gamble about contiguous fevers, then you might consider setting up an alarm to check his/her temperature, make it quick, wear a mask or at least cover mouth and nose, wear gloves, use sanitizers. But that is not me, I wouldn't do that to the person, especially up there on a mountain, but again, thats a personal opinion.</p>

"Can I use a blue plastic tarp to float my vehicle across water?","1859","","<p>For those unaware, the US army has been using canvas tarps to float jeeps across water for decades.</p>

<p>Canvas tarps are stronger than the blue plastic tarps you purchase for most uses today. Can I use a the standard blue plastic tarp to float my vehicle across water?  Are there any limits or considerations? </p>
","<p>If your tarp is heavy duty enough, I'd expect it to work. Most blue plastic tarps are fairly thin and weak, so while it might work, it would be risky. </p>

<p>The difficulty is that you will be abrading the tarp by driving onto it, probably subjecting it to abrasion from rubbing against the jeep's body, and risking the tarp catching on underwater debris. The thinner your tarp, the higher your risk. </p>

<p>Even a pinprick leak could be a problem, depending on how long you are in the water. A flimsy tarp of any material will develop leaks or rip relatively easily, maybe even while loading for your first test. A sturdy one would probably hold up to a few trips, although I've got no idea how many. The toughest waterproof fabrics are used for whitewater rafting vessels, which gives an idea of how sturdy a tarp (not polypropylene) can be.</p>

<p>Make sure before you start that you don't have any leaks in the tarp. I've never had to do this, but a possible setup that comes to mind is hanging the tarp in a cup shape and dumping in 10 gallons of water or more, then swishing it all over the tarp surface to make sure it doesn't leak. At the minimum, I'd spray one side with a hose, but that has a few problems: 1) it's hard to be sure no spray is reaching the far side, which makes leaks harder to spot, and 2) if the material is only somewhat waterproof, it might still seem impermeable when sprayed, while holding several gallons would show that it can't stand up to long, heavy exposure.</p>

"How do you treat frozen lungs?","1859","","<p>You know that bleeding lung feeling you get after going out for a long run on a freezing cold night? The one where you can taste blood in the back of your jaw, and begin to wheeze and cough as fluids start forming in your lungs? </p>

<p>Whatever the circumstances may be, if you end up ""freezing"" your lungs from too much activity and breathing too hard in the frozen air, what's the best way to treat them and aid recovery?</p>
","<p>Typically runners exert their lungs the most if compared to Mountaineers. I am strictly not comparing with Swimmers of course.</p>

<p>First, why would it happen, how do you know whats happening: 
Do we normally catch cold, runny nose when its cold outside? Normally we do. ""How much cold"" can vary from person to person though. Getting runny nose is one of the body's defense mechanisms. Phlegm is the substance that contains mucus (a protective substance) and other bacteria, bluntly saying which is produced by Respiratory System, to be precise by Mucus Membranes. </p>

<p>Respiratory Mucus protects the whole Respiratory tract and the lungs by trapping foreign particles that are inhaled through the nose when we breathe. It also helps to heat-up the inhaled air before it reaches the lungs. </p>

<p>So,</p>

<ul>
<li>If you have a runny nose, its okay. Still try and breathe through Nose and not through mouth.</li>
<li>Obviously, it is going to be difficult to breathe through nose and so doing a strenuous tasks with same efficiency as normal is a difficult task to pull off. You are not supposed to exert.</li>
<li>Important: Don't choose to clean up your nose by means of Otrivin or similar products and continue getting into colder regions. This would make you feel better, but only for a while. Should you continue with your task, getting into colder regions thinking that you have now knocked the running nose issue off and are now good to get colder, Beware, it may result in constricting bronchial tubes which would exert lungs <em>a lot</em> and would definitely make breathing a lot difficult. Common symptoms of such a situation is coughing up blood. Taa-dan, you need help now. </li>
</ul>

<p><em>(May be not entirely needed for this answer, but interesting: Why would lungs exert, its because you don't warm your lungs enough, Mucus around the Lung Fibers and tissues isn't enough, the bronchial muscles get dry, resulting in constriction.)</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Get into warmer conditions.</li>
<li>Continue to breathe through nose.</li>
<li>Take cloth, breath-out/exhale through mouth on it, and put it on your nose, feels warm and better. (I am not thinking of Bad-breath here)</li>
<li>Put on an additional layer of clothing on your upper body half, like an additional jacket or something.</li>

"First time camping, need advice","1857","","<p>Me and my wife have never done camping before and always wanted to do it. This time we are planning to go for a small camping trip but have no idea how to prepare for it. We like to hike and are beginners in that too!</p>

<p>Is there a guide for starters or any other resources we should look into?</p>
","<p>Others will tell you exactly what to bring, maybe even recommend brands.  I'm going to cover things at a much higher level, with a few specific tips.</p>

<p>The basic requirements of camping match the basics of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs"">Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Physiological needs</strong> <em>(food, clothing and shelter)</em></li>
<li><strong>Safety needs</strong> <em>(hope for the best, plan for the worst)</em></li>
<li><strong>Self Actualization</strong> <em>(you're doing this to have fun, right?)</em></li>
</ol>

<p>If you're going camping you're going to need to provide yourself with food, clothing, and shelter.</p>

<h2><strong>Food</strong></h2>

<p>The three main factors are:</p>

<p><strong>Weight</strong>: The lighter the food, the easier (and more) you can carry.  Water is the largest source of weight in food (1L of water is 1kg of weight) and often readily available (in lakes, rivers, taps, and faucets), so many campers use dehydrated food when weight is an issue. Tricks to avoid the issue of weight include car camping, using a boat, or having food prepared/delivered by others. </p>

<p><strong>Quantity</strong>: It sounds silly, but can you imagine running out of food? You need to make sure you plan enough food for all of your meals. Always err on the side of caution, you're going to be exerting yourself!  With practice you can bring less. The longer your trip, the bigger role food plays in your trip, so start with a simple overnight trip and work your way up.</p>

<p><strong>Preparation</strong>: How you prepare and eat your food will govern how simple or complicated your camping trip is.  The easier it is to prepare your food, the happier you will be.  The less waste you have after, the less hassle you'll have.  This is why there's a whole industry around ready-made food in pouches.  The simplest options require the addition of hot water.  This abstracts cooking down to the art of boiling water.  Do you have the tools to do this?  </p>

<h2>Clothing</h2>

<p><strong>Staying dry and warm is your main goal.</strong> Protect yourself from the elements appropriately. Be aware of the weather around you, realize that conditions can change, that temperatures drop in the evenings, and that altitude impacts temperature.  <strong>Layers are the key to success</strong>: Too cold? put on another layer, Too hot? Take a layer off.  </p>

<p>Cotton is the worst material for this as it does not keep you warm when it is wet, and takes forever to dry.  Synthetics dry quickly but don't always offer the best warmth. Wool works well in hot and cold weather and takes a while to dry but stays warm when wet.  Footwear is just as important.  </p>

<p>Open-toe shoes are a bad idea, support and comfort are more important than anything else.  Wear wool socks instead of cotton socks and you'll decrease the chances of having miserable feet (I've seen hundreds of army recruits with mangy feet and blisters because they wore sport socks in their army boots, learn from their mistake!)</p>

<p><strong>Shelter</strong>: there are many options.  If you're providing your own shelter, then start with a tent (for shelter), a sleeping bag (for warmth), and a mattress (for comfort).  </p>

<p>If you buy or borrow a tent, take the time to put it together and take it apart at home once so that you understand how to do it under ideal circumstances.  <strong>When you get to your camp site the first thing you do is put up your tent.</strong>  Clear the ground of rocks and sticks before you lay your tent.  Keep the doors closed to keep out bugs and rain.  Keep your tent away from the camp fire.  Keep your tent away from the intersection of two glacial rivers (brrr!).  If it's raining, avoid touching the walls of your tent, once water goes through, it keeps coming through. Don't forget to dry out your tent at home, or else it will go mouldy.</p>

<p>You can avoid using a tent (and carrying it) by renting a hut or cabin.  The advantage here is you may not need to bring certain things (tent, mattress, cooking supplies, utensils, be sure to confirm in advance from the location, not second hand). </p>

<p>Sleeping bags are either synthetic (cheaper, warm but don't pack down as well and wear out over time) or down-filled (more expensive, pack down well, last longer). People will tell you that a wet synthetic bag is warmer than a wet down bag, but a wet sleeping bag sucks so much you won't care what it's made out of.  Start cheap and work your way up.  Realize they have a temperature rating and that the comfort level is always about 5 degrees off.</p>

<h2>Safety</h2>

<ul>
<li>Make a plan.  <em>I'm going to such and such a place using this trail, cooking dinner, having a camp fire, and coming back the next day in time for lunch.</em> </li>
<li>Tell people where you are going, who you are going with, and when you
are supposed to get back.  Be specific!  Give them license plate
numbers and car models.   </li>
<li>Know who the emergency contact numbers are
where you are going (guess what, 911 doesn't work everywhere, is
there a park warden number? Put it in your phone!  Don't assume your
phone will work!).  </li>
<li>Bring a map.  If the map is not drawn to scale, get one that is (grumble grumble). Know how to read the map.</li>
<li>Know your limits.  How far can you walk in an hour? Okay, now do it with hills and 15 kilos on your back.</li>
<li>Bring lots of water.</li>
<li>Bring a first aid kit. Get familiar with how to use everything in the first aid kit before you leave. Put a lighter and an energy bar in your first aid kit. </li>
<li>Find out what the local dangers
are: do you need to bring bear spray? Are the octopi poisonous? Is
it tick season? Should you have started taking malaria pills seven
days earlier? Do you need to bring avalanche gear? Do you have to
worry about bacteria in the water?</li>
<li>Bring a flashlight with new batteries. Headlamps are great because they keep your hands free.</li>
<li>If you're using hiking poles, wrap a few meters of duct-tape around each pole, now if ever a boot splits, a binding breaks, a strap fails, a tent leaks, or a leg requires a splint you've always got something to bind it with.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Self Actualization</h2>

<p>Why are you camping? To enjoy the wilderness? To sit around a fire? To see a sunrise or sunset? To get away from others? To get closer to others?  To challenge yourself?  Figure out why you want to go camping, and make sure you set everything up so that you can accomplish that goal.  </p>

"How safe is a chest harness when used without a sit harness?","1857","","<p>How safe is it to use a chest harness without a sit harness? I ask this question because of an experience I had while on holiday.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago I was in China and hiked/climbed HuaShan (see this <a href=""http://www.chinanomads.com/deadly-hike-huashan/"">link</a> for some info/pictures). This is basically a hike but with some very steep sections protected by chains. The most dangerous (but optional) sections are cordoned off and, to access them, you are provided with what seemed like a chest harness by staff - I found a photo of one <a href=""http://www.tripchinaguide.com/public/upload/photo/mount-hua/img_707_d20140521102200.jpg"">here</a>. Would a harness of this kind be effective in the event of a slip/fall? I'm not sure; naively I'd have thought that a fall could leave you in an awkward position from which self-rescue would be impossible, or you could even slip out of the harness??</p>

<p>EDIT: thanks for the responses. Some more info about the specific situation at Hua Shan...</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Until a few years ago there was no safety equipment whatsoever, despite the fact that this is an extremely busy route with access seemingly regulated by the authorities. I guess that China is not well known for its high standards of health and safety. </p></li>
<li><p>The harness photo doesn't tell the whole story; there are also some very steep (almost vertical) sections - the first link contains some photos which hint at these sections.</p></li>
<li><p>It's not 'real' climbing - it is, however, a spectacular example of a situation where the use of wooden planks and pieces of iron has allowed access to terrain which would otherwise be considered a very highly graded and exposed rock climb.</p></li>
<li><p>Some people would probably be happy to follow this route without any protection. However, I think that many people would prefer to have some level of protection on the route. I'm just concerned that the protection provided may offer only a false sense of security.</p></li>
</ol>
","<p><strong>TLDR:</strong><br>
Never ever use a chest harness alone.</p>

<p>It depends on what you mean by effective: It can stop a fall, there was a time (before the seventies) when chest harnesses (alone) were used in mountaineering. The big problem comes after: suspension trauma.</p>

<p>This is not limited to breast harnesses at all. This is the main life-threatening problem apart from direct mechanical injuries after a fall in climbing. Without movement the blood will get stuck in the lower extremities leading to orthostatic shock, leading to a circulatory collapse. According to Pit Schubert[1]: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>after only 2min hanging in a chest harness the arms are paralysed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means you cannot rescue yourself anymore. According to Schubert hanging freely (in any kind of harness) is deadly after a maximum of 2h, potentially much earlier.</p>

<p>So assuming on this trail you may be alone a chest harness can prove fatal in case of fall. Even if somebody arrives in time to save you (i.e. bring you into lying position before you are in shock) you will likely sustain damage to your arms/chest.<br>
In addition an operator using chest harnesses does not show off competence. You have to wonder whether safety is precarious in other regards as well. I would immediately stop using their services.</p>

  <p>John Muir is said to have traveled for weeks in the back country, but he never took any food with him, [...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not true. There is a nice article <a href=""http://www.sierraclub.org/john_muir_exhibit/life/john_muir_menu_j_parker_huber.aspx"">here</a> by John Huber about what Muir ate while on trips. Mainly bread. He dried it so that it wouldn't get moldy. He also often brought tea and sugar with him. It's true that he never brought a gun and didn't hunt. It sounds like he was often in calorie debt while hiking.</p>

<p>I believe the old timers in the Sierra usually slept on beds of pine boughs and kept camp fires roaring all night long. Today, that would be considered an ecological crime -- if every backpacker in the Sierra did that, the mountains would be denuded of trees. But in those days it was a method of sleeping comfortably without having to carry heavy bedding. There is a story about Muir getting stuck on top of Mt. Shasta and nearly dying of cold. He saved himself by lying down next to the sulfur vents near the summit.</p>

<p><strong>Aiguille</strong> - [<em>French</em> - needle] A tall, narrow spire of rock.  See pinnacle, spire, needle.</p>

<p><strong>Alluvial fan</strong> - A cone of sediment deposited at an abrupt change of slope; for example, where a post-glacial stream meets the flat floor of a U-shaped valley. Alluvial fans are also common in arid regions where streams flowing off escarpments may periodically carry large loads of sediment during flash floods.  Example: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alluvial_fan"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Alluvial fan</a></p>

<p><strong>Cleaver</strong> - A cleaver is a type of arête that separates a unified flow of glacial ice from its uphill side into two glaciers flanking, and flowing parallel to, the ridge. Cleaver gets its name from the way it resembles a meat cleaver slicing meat into two parts.</p>

<p><strong>Cliff</strong> - A steep rock face between land and sea, the profile of which is determined largely by the nature of the coastal rocks. For example, resistant rocks such as granite (e.g. at Land's End, England) will produce steep and rugged cliffs. Example: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliff"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cliff</a></p>

<p><strong>Col</strong> - [<em>Latin</em> - neck] the low point on a ridge joining two peaks. Glaciologists reserve this term for gaps of glacial origin, but others use it much more generally.  Example: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Col"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Col</a></p>

<p><strong>Corrie</strong> - A bowl-shaped hollow on a mountainside in a glaciated region; the area where a valley glacier originates. In glacial times the corrie contained an icefi eld, which in cross section appears as in diagram a above. The shape of the corrie is determined by the rotational erosive force of ice as the glacier moves downslope.  See also cirque or cwm.</p>

<p><strong>Couloir</strong> - [<em>French</em> - passage, corridor] a steep gorge or gully in a mountainside. Couloirs are good places to find uninterrupted snow and ice.  Example: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couloir"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Couloir</a></p>

<p><strong>Crag</strong> - [<em>Gaelic</em>] - a rocky outcrop</p>

<p><strong>Crag and tail</strong> - Also cragg or (Scotland) craig.  A feature of lowland glaciation, where a resistant rock outcrop withstands erosion by a glacier and remains as a feature after the Ice Age. Rocks of volcanic or metamorphic origin are likely to produce such a feature. As the ice advances over the crag, material will be eroded from the face and sides and will be deposited as a mass of boulder clay and debris on the leeward side, thus producing a 'tail'.  Example: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crag_and_tail"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Crag and tail</a></p>

<p><strong>Dièdre</strong> - See Dihedral.</p>

<p><strong>Dike</strong> - A dike or dyke, in geological usage, is a sheet of rock that formed in a fracture in a pre-existing rock body. Dikes can be either magmatic or sedimentary in origin. Magmatic dikes form when magma intrudes into a crack then crystallizes as a sheet intrusion, either cutting across layers of rock or through an unlayered mass of rock. Clastic dikes are formed when sediment fills a pre-existing crack.  Example: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dike_(geology)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Dike</a></p>

<p><strong>Dip Slope</strong> - The gentler of the two slopes on either side of an escarpment crest; the dip slope inclines in the direction of the dipping strata; the steep slope in front of the crest is the scarp slope.

<p><strong>Escarpment</strong> - steep slope or long cliff that forms as an effect of faulting or erosion and separates two relatively level areas of differing elevations. Usually escarpment is used interchangeably with scarp (from the Italian scarpa, shoe). But some sources differentiate the two terms, where escarpment refers to the margin between two landforms, while scarp is synonymous with a cliff or steep slope. The surface of the steep slope is called a scarp face. This (escarpment) is a ridge which has a gentle (dip) slope on one side and a steep (scarp) slope on the other side.  Example: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escarpment"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Escarpment</a></p>

<p><strong>Fault</strong> - A fracture in the Earth’s crust on either side of which the rocks have been relatively displaced. Faulting occurs in response to stress in the Earth’s crust; the release of this stress in fault movement is experienced as an earthquake. See also rift valley.  Example: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_(geology)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Fault</a></p>

<p><strong>Felsenmeer</strong> - [<em>German</em> - sea of rock] - Terrain of fractured rock formed in place by frost action. Compare ""talus"".  Also, Block Field, Bolder Field, Stone Field.  Example: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockfield"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Blockfield</a></p>

<p><strong>Fold</strong> - A bending or buckling of once horizontal rock strata. Many folds are the result of rocks being crumpled at plate boundaries (see plate tectonics), though earthquakes can also cause rocks to fold, as can igneous intrusions. Example: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_(geology)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Fold</a></p>

<p><strong>Fold mountains</strong> - Mountains which have been formed by large-scale and complex folding. Studies of typical fold mountains (the Himalayas, Andes, Alps and Rockies) indicate that folding has taken place deep inside the Earth’s crust and upper mantle as well as in the upper layers of the crust.  Example: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_mountains"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Fold mountains</a></p>

<p><strong>Gendarme</strong> - [<em>French</em> - man-at-arms] A steep-sided rock formation along a ridge (metaphorically ""guarding"" the summit).  Example: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gendarme_(mountaineering)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gendarme</a></p>

<p><strong>Glacier</strong> - [<em>French</em>] - Year-round ice covering a large area. Formed from snowfall, glaciers will slide very slowly downhill.</p>

<p><strong>Gorge</strong> - See canyon.</p>

<p><strong>Gully</strong> - [<em>Middle French</em> - ""throat""] - a channel caused by erosion, especially by water running down a slope. The distinction between ""gully"" and ""valley"" or ""canyon"" is one of scale - a gully is usually less than a hundred meters in width. (It is also at least a meter wide; anything smaller would be a ditch or runnel.)  Example: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gully"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gully</a> <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canyon"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Canyon</a> <a href=""https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/runnel"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Runnel</a></p>

<p><strong>Highpoint</strong> - The point of highest elevation in a given area, eg country, state, or county. A highpoint need not be a summit (or even a peak): The highpoint of the state of Connecticut is on the slopes of Mt Frissel, whose summit is outside the state.</p>

<p><strong>Horn</strong> - a peak having that shape. In glaciology, a horn is defined as the sheer-sided peak remaining after glaciers have removed at least three sides.</p>

<p><strong>Inselberg</strong> - [<em>German</em> - ""island mountain""] - a mountain with no other mountains nearby.  Examples: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_inselbergs"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">List of inselbergs</a></p>

<p><strong>Interlocking spurs</strong> - Obstacles of hard rock round which a river twists and turns in a V-shaped valley. Erosion is pronounced on the concave banks, and this ultimately causes the development of spurs which alternate on either side of the river and interlock as shown in the diagram.  Example: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlocking_spur"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Interlocking spur</a></p>

<p><strong>Klettersteig</strong> - [German] - See Via Ferreta.</p>

<p><strong>Knob</strong> - A peak or hill having that shape.</p>

<p><strong>Knoll</strong> - small round hill.</p>

<p><strong>Ledge</strong> - A narrow, (more-or-less) flat spot along an otherwise (mostly) vertical face. Synonym: ""shelf"".</p>

<p><strong>Massif</strong> - [<em>French</em> - massive] - a range or plateau; a ""mass"" of peaks or mountains. Carries an implication that the peaks or mountains are bunched together, but not in a neat line. Borrowed from French. Like ""range"", can be applied on extremely varied scales, from ""Massif Central"" to ""Massif du Mont Blanc.""  Examples: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Massif</a></p>

<p><strong>Moat</strong> - Gap along the side of a glacier, separating it from the rock of the valley wall. Compare ""bergschrund"".</p>

Example: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_pass"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mountain pass</a></p>

<p><strong>Peak, Summit</strong> - This is the top of the mountain and a climber’s ultimate goal.  In theory, every mountain has exactly one summit.</p>

<p>The difference between a peak and summit is that mountains can have multiple peaks, and definition is usually localized.  A peak is a point that's higher than all other adjacent points. There may be some higher point not far away, but if you can't get there without going downhill first, you're standing on a peak. </p>

<p>In common usage, a ""peak"" is pointy, otherwise it may be called a ""knob"", ""crag"", ""bald"", or ""dome"". </p>

<p><strong>Penitentes</strong> - [<em>Spanish</em> - penitents] - Spiky ice formations caused by uneven evaporation/melting of ice in sunlight. See also sun cups.  Example: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penitente_(snow_formation)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Penitente</a></p>

<p><strong>Pinnacle</strong> - A pinnacle, tower, spire, needle or natural tower in geology is an individual column of rock, isolated from other rocks or groups of rocks, in the shape of a vertical shaft or spire.

<p><strong>Point</strong> - 1. Any location. 2. A small peninsula, or a formation resembling one. 3. A peak, prominence, or spur not considered worthy of the name ""peak"", or simply not yet named. In the absence of any other name, a peak or benchmark may be referred to as ""point xxx"", where xxx is its elevation.</p>

<p><strong>Prominence</strong> - [<em>Latin</em> - forward projection] 1. The quality of rising above or projecting beyond one's neighbors. 2. A peak or outcrop. 3. A measure of how far a peak rises above its neighbors: the minimum vertical distance one must descend in order to travel (on the ground) from a peak to any higher peak.  Example: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topographic_prominence"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Prominence</a></p>

<p><strong>Range</strong> - A range is a group of mountains.</p>

<p><strong>Roche moutonnée</strong> - An outcrop of resistant rock sculpted by the passage of a glacier.  Also sheepback.  Example: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_moutonn%C3%A9e"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Roche moutonnée</a></p>

<p><strong>Scree</strong> - [<em>Nordic</em>] - A surface consisting of small loose rocks which have slid from above and are likely to slide again when stepped upon.  Example: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scree"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Scree</a></p>

<p><strong>Sea level</strong> - Fictional surface formed by the average height of the oceans, ignoring tidal cycles, weather, etc, and extended underneath the land to form a continous surface. This surface is not spherical. Commonly used approximations include ""ellipsoids"" (slightly-squashed spheres) and ""geoids"" (bumpier); the latter reflect variations in the strength of gravity in different locations. In many places the various kinds of ""sea level"" differ from each other by tens of meters, so next time you hear someone recite the altitude of Peak X down to the nearest centimeter, make sure you ask what ""reference datum"" they're using.</p>

<p><strong>Seif dune</strong> - A linear sand dune, the ridge of sand lying parallel to the prevailing wind direction. The eddying movement of the wind keeps the sides of the dune steep. Example: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune#Longitudinal_.28Seif.29_dunes"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Longitudinal dunes</a></p>

<p><strong>Separation</strong> - the horizontal distance between two points. Sometimes used in deciding whether two points ""count"" as separate peaks or mountains.</p>

<p><strong>Shoulder</strong> - a lateral protrusion on a mountain, or a point on the mountain where the slope changes, forming a convex shape.</p>

<p><strong>Slope</strong> - This is the side of the mountain.  See ""Snowline"".  Example: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(slope)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Slope</a></p>

<p><strong>Snowline</strong> - the elevation above which snow remains on the ground year-round, ie the lower boundary of a permanent snowcap. Sometimes also used to designate the lower elevation boundary of merely seasonal snowfields.  Example: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_line"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Snowline</a></p>

<p><strong>Spire</strong> - a tall and narrow rock formation, resembling a steeple.  See pinnacle, needle, aiguille.</p>

<p><strong>Spur</strong> - [from riding spur, a pointy tool for kicking a horse] - a part of a mountain that projects outward, laterally away from the main body.  Example: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spur_(topography)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Spur</a></p>

<p><strong>Sun cups</strong> - uneven surface of snow or ice caused by uneven evaporation/melting in sunlight. See also ""penitentes"".</p>

<p><strong>Verglas</strong> - [<em>French</em> - glassy ice] - thin, clear ice formed by the freezing of rain or meltwater on a hard, smooth surface (ie, rock). Extremely slippery, and sometimes too thin to hold a crampon or ice axe.</p>

<p><strong>Via Ferrata</strong> - [Spanish] A route on a mountain where the safety is provided by steel ropes or chains, permanently fixated to the rock. The progression is often aided by artificial steps or ladders. Typically found in the Alps, also called Klettersteig.

"Why are climbing shoes usually a slightly tighter than the usual mountaineering shoes?","1838","","<p>Why are climbing shoes a slightly tighter than the regular mountaineering shoes?</p>
","<p>Climbing shoes need to be extremely tight* because they frequently have to support a lot of weight on extremely tiny footholds, often on the tip of the toes:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/C712s.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/C712s.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Any free space inside the shoe could cause the shoe to deform (more) and slip off.</p>

<p>*: putting on the shoes should not be painful right away, but you can't get optimal performance with shoes that are comfortable to wear for hours and walk around in. It may of course be sensible to sacrifice some performance when you need to wear the shoes longer, e.g. on multipitch climbs.</p>

"What are the major difference between a regular sleeping bag and one designed for women?","1837","","<p>I see more and more sleeping bags designed for women.  I was wondering what were the major differences with the regular sleeping bag?</p>

<p>Does it have to do more with the shape or insulation?</p>
","<p>We did some research on this once and the results were kind of sad.</p>

<p>For major backpacking brands of sleeping bags (say, Marmot or Big Agnes) the major differences between sleeping bags for the two genders were these:</p>

<ol>
<li>Women's sleeping bags were slightly smaller.</li>
<li>A bag that is listed as a '20-degree bag' for woman would listed as a '10-degree' bag for men.</li>
<li>Women's bags came in more garish colors and frequently had pictures of flowers on them.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Number (1)</strong> above seems fine.<br>
<strong>Number (2)</strong> seems highly dubious. Are we saying that women ""just can't take the cold"" as well as men? Is there (I really, really hope) evidence showing that women actually need more insulation for safety? I happen to know a few doctors, and they can't support this idea.<br>
And <strong>number (3)</strong> is the same for all women's outdoors gear. You know it's a woman's model helmet because it's pink and has flowers on it. </p>

Apparently he had his PLB in his pocket during a ski run, and somehow knocked the cover off, didn't realize that the cover was off, and then the ""on"" button got pressed. Seems like a very unlikely sequence of events, but I guess out of some large number of users, freak accidents like this are going to happen.</p>

<p>What happened next in his case was that the Air Force called his wife, his wife called him on his cell phone, and they were able to straighten things out over the phone. He wasn't fined or thrown in jail. Presumably the Air Force called his home phone because he'd supplied that phone number when he registered the unit.</p>

<p>If you accidentally activate it somewhere that you can't be contacted by phone, then I don't see any way for them to distinguish that from a real emergency. The most serious consequences would then be for whoever's trying to rescue you. If it's a volunteer search and rescue team, then they have to leave work, roll out of bed or whatever, head off into the wilderness, and possibly put themselves in danger searching for you. It's very common for search and rescue teams to get hurt, especially in mountain environments. You want to be very careful not to put these folks in danger unnecessarily. There are probably two reasonable options if you do activate it unnecessarily and don't have phone contact. (1) You could hike out to where you can get phone service and prevent a search from being initiated. (2) You could stay put and make it easy for them to find you. This is what is usually advised in an actual emergency: just stay put.</p>

I have other friends who say folding and rolling the rainfly prolongs the life of the tent, because stuffing waterproof material over and over is going to make it leak.</p>

<p>I was wondering if there has been any testing that proofs either of the two camps (pun intended) correct, or that shows that there is not significant difference between the two approaches.</p>
","<p><strong>Folding</strong> becomes an issue if you religiously fold in the same spot over and over -- say line up the corners all pretty and re-fold. Try this with any plastic, thin metal, etc... fold, unfold, fold, unfold, fold ad infinitum, and it will weaken and fail.</p>

<p>If you fold a different way each time, then you run little risk of this becoming a problem, though be careful of consistent points that folds tend to cross (ie the center of the fly might get folded each and every time even if you start with a different angle of cross fold each time)</p>

<p>Advantages: a fold and roll tends to pack smaller</p>

<p><strong>Stuffing</strong> all but guarantees you won't stress the same bit of fabric repeatedly, since the folds are distributed fairly randomly around the tent. However, since the tent doesn't pack down as tight, if you are trying to cram it in to a small space, you might subject each individual fold to higher pressure (possibly a downside)</p>

"Diving mask colouring","1827","","<p>I'm learning to dive and the first purchase is a mask and snorkel. The issue I have is discerning what mask to get colour-wise. There seem to be two main types for the silicon, clear and black. The lens can then have different coloured frames. My question is:</p>

<p><strong>What is the difference between clear and black masks, and do the colours impair your vision in any way?</strong> (Such as a red frame making things seem more red.)</p>
","<p>In my experience fitting people with Dive masks frame colours almost entirely come down to personal preference. As others have noted the actual silicone skirt of the masks, as well as the shape of the frame, will have a greater effect on what you can actually see.</p>

<p>The most important thing to consider when getting a mask is the fit of the mask, even if you look as bad-ass and stylish as James Bond, you are not going to enjoy your dive if your mask is leaking or pressing against your brow/forehead. Go to your local dive shop and try on the masks that they have on display. The staff there will be more than happy to talk about the fit and features with you (I certainly was whenever an interested student diver came in).</p>

<p>It seems from your question that you want to maximize visibility, so I can share a couple of tips on things to look for. First try on a handful of masks and narrow them down to ones that fit comfortably, once you have done that you can narrow them down further. Your field of view in mask is mostly determined by two things, size of the lenses and distance between the glass and your eyes. Masks with great big glass lenses to them will allow you to see a whole lot, but are also a bit bulkier and more difficult to clear/equalize (not usually a huge deal when diving, but can be annoying if you plan to snorkel with the mask as well). Likewise masks with the glass close to your eyes will allow you good field of view without the bulkiness, but can be very difficult to fit properly (people with even a bit of a brow my find they push into there forehead causing discomfort). Try and find a balance between small mask and big glass that works for you, personally I prefer smaller masks as they are easier for me to clear/equalize when snorkeling.</p>

<p>The only time colour really makes a difference is when you drop the mask or it falls off your head. Clear masks with clear silicone are really hard to find when you drop them or they fall off the boat. Other than that we would recommend the neon yellow masks and snorkels for parents of children or other snorkelers that wanted to be more visible on the surface (either to people on shore or boating).</p>

<p>I could go on all day about mask fittings (black silicone vs clear, single window vs. two , teardrop glass vs square, etc. etc.) so let me know if you have any other questions. </p>

What is this material?</p>
","<p>As seen in the photos of the repair kits below, the wick is the fabric-like material which is made of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_fiber"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">fiberglass</a>. It doesn't burn but does eventually degrade when exposed to the high heat of a stove.</p>

<p>A simple replacement wick could potentially be fashioned out of nearly any <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_wool"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">fiberglass insulation</a> such as that used in home construction. Furnace filters are often made of fiberglass filter media. It is also often used (usually bonded  with other materials) as thermal insulation in automobiles to isolate the engine and exhaust heat from the cabin of the vehicle. If used from one of these type of sources, make sure the fiberglass itself is free of any other combustible materials or glues. These are simply a few applications where fiberglass insulation is used as it has become quite a ubiquitous material.</p>

<p>Another possible source is the wick from a lantern. Even with different fuel types, most lanterns I've ever seen use fiberglass for the wick. However there are so many lantern types and brands out there that you'd need to research the exact type for yourself. But the main thing is to make sure that it's made of fiberglass or other fire-retardant material.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.trickconcepts.com/Understanding-Wick-Types-W14.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This page</a> has some good information on wick material. It mentions Kevlar and Nomex as some viable, though more costly alternatives to fiberglass.

<p>We know from <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/9920"">How much sea water can I safely drink?</a> that drinking salt water is not good.  But adding any substance to water that will form a solute will lower the freezing temp. You can drink as much sugar water as you want, the only risk is added calories which you likely need anyhow.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The higher the concentration of salt, the lower the freezing point drops. Any foreign substance, such as sugar, alcohol, or any chemical salt, added to the water, forms a solute, which will lower the freezing point and melt ice. 
  <a href=""http://aquarius.umaine.edu/activities/can_sw_freeze.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if I want to add sugar to my water to keep it from freezing how do I calculate how much sugar per unit of water I need to add, to keep it liquid at a given temperature? </p>
","<p>This can be calculated using a property called cryoscopic constant <em>K<sub>f</sub></em> which links the concentration of a solved substance to the freezing point depression <em>T<sub>d</sub></em>:</p>

<p><em>T<sub>d</sub> = m * K<sub>f</sub></em></p>

<p>where m is the molality which is the amount of mols of solved substance per kg of solvent (here water). For water <em>K<sub>f</sub></em> is 1.86K*kg/mol and the molar mass of sugar (sucrose) is 342g/mol. So to calculate the freezing point depression do:</p>

<p><em>T<sub>d</sub></em> = 1.86 / 342 * mass of sugar in g / mass of water in kg</p>

<p>Some examples for grams of sugar added to 1 liter water:</p>

<pre>
g/l     <i>T<sub>d</sub></i> 
10      0.054  
50      0.27

<p>I found a <a href=""http://www.all-science-fair-projects.com/print_project_1151_38"">science-fair-project</a> that measured this.</p>

<p>If you're extremely confident that your gear placements are bomber, then you can get away with a somewhat wider angle between the different strands, which lets you get by with slightly less cord. If some of them are not that great, you can pamper them by lessening the angle to decrease the mechanical advantage, but that requires more cord. If the pro really sucks, then you might want to consider an equalette setup, which will give you perfect equalization.

<p>Even if those are just common sense ideas, if you are aware of any correlation between these data samples and the possibility of a hail storm, please share.</p>
","<p>In order to distinguish hail from a thunderstorm you should know how the temperature is decreasing with altitude. Generally if it decreases really fast you have formation of hail. <em>(Edit: you mentioned dew point, this is where condensation of warm hair happens, freezing level is not the same thing and it will be located somewhere higher than the dew point. Knowing the Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate and the Saturated Adiabatic Lapse Rate is necessary to find cloudbase and freezing level. Im not sure how much in depth you want to go with these things so I will let you do the research on it.

<p><strong>Dry air</strong> at a certain altitude will lower the freezing level in the atmosphere, a lower freezing level means that eventual hail wont have the time to melt into drops like it would if it had to fall longer through a warmer air layer. For the same reason places at higher altitudes would be closer to the normal freezing level. I don't think you can know how dry is the air at a certain altitude with a simple weather station that gets datas only from ground level. What you know, though, is that certain places tend to often have this dry middle layer and so <strong>location</strong> becomes an indicator for you as those are informations you can find. </p>

<p><strong>Wind</strong>, higher up, that you can more or less tell from looking at the clouds before the event and around (movement and plumes). In a thunderstorm you have strong updrafts and downdrafts, if vertical and in all directions (that, I guess, you would know collecting live datas from various weather stations in the region if you want to use want to use only simple datas) you tend to have a short or failed thunderstorm but if there is high wind higher up (speed wind shear where higher altitude winds are much faster than ground levels) you find that it can push the updraft sideways (updraft and downdraft will form a sort of Λ ) so that the feed of warmer hair is maintained and the updraft speed (Upward Vertical Velocity, if you want to look it up on your own) will be high and hail and violent thunderstorms (or worse) can result between updraft and downdraft.</p>

<p>Also, where I'm from, farmers look at storm clouds approaching and if these present lighter streaks they know hail is coming (and you used to start hearing hail cannons). For this reasons <strong>clouds</strong> become another indication, with short notice though. Once I started paragliding, skydiving and kayaking weather forecast and satellite datas became much more important and reliable than anything else to figure out possibilities of hail storms much earlier. </p>

<p>So if where you live the weather is so unpredictable to not match anything above there wont be much simple datas you can collect yourself at ground level that will give much notice. If you want to collect weather informations available on the net to make your own forecasts you obviously can, learning a bit of meteorology, but at that point you find the forecasts already prepared for you and probably more reliable. </p>

<p>PS: with the data you listed alone, no you can't tell what’s gonna come down.</p>

"How do you mount ski bindings?","1782","","<p>And what are the associated risks?</p>
","<p>For most people, having a shop do the mount is a hassle-free and relatively inexpensive way to mount bindings. Shops will often mount the ski ""on the line"" but many will mount it to your basic specifications.</p>

<p><strong>Why mount yourself?</strong></p>

<p>In my experience, the main reason someone would choose to mount their own ski bindings is that they want to mount older but still serviceable bindings that a shop refuses to deal with, they want to do a custom mount involving binding inserts, swap plates, quiver killers, or they want to use multiple boots and mount the binding in a way that multiple BSLs (boot sole lengths) would fit, which would not work in a standard mount.</p>

<p><strong>Tools &amp; Templates</strong></p>

<p>A binding mount can usually be done with some C-clamps, epoxy, masking tape, a power drill, some bits, and a binding template. It is difficult to provide templates here as they are usually printable in PDF form and specific to the binding make and model. They are available online from sites such as: <a href=""http://www.techinfo.bindingfreedom.com/"">Binding Freedom</a>, or <a href=""http://www.slidewright.com/weblog/ski-snowboard/bindings-ski-snowboard/paper-ski-binding-templates/"">Slide Wright</a> both of which I've used in the past. An important thing with templates is to ensure they are printed to scale.</p>

<p><strong>Risks</strong></p>

<p>As the comments above mentioned, mounting skis is a somewhat precise process, which definitely embodies the adage ""measure twice, cut once"". Common risks are: drilling too many holes and turning your skis into ""Swiss cheese"" thus making them very fragile, drilling through the ski if you aren't careful, or incorrectly measuring by enough of a margin so that you can't click in.</p>

<p><strong>Tutorials</strong></p>

<p>General tutorials are available online, in fact my friend and I have <a href=""http://1water1coffee1beer.com/grep-prepswap-plate-mounting/"">written several</a> from our first few mounting experiences. I'll try to summarize the steps very briefly here. Extensive tutorials including video can be found at: <a href=""http://www.techinfo.bindingfreedom.com/Tutorial_Videos.html"">Binding Freedom Tutorials</a>, <a href=""http://www.tetongravity.com/"">Teton Gravity Forums</a>, <a href=""http://www.wildsnow.com"">Wild Snow articles</a>, or articles <a href=""http://1water1coffee1beer.com/grep-prepswap-plate-mounting/"">here</a>, <a href=""http://1water1coffee1beer.com/quiver-killers-and-powder-baskets/"">here</a>, and <a href=""http://1water1coffee1beer.com/winter-readiness-dual-dynafit-duke-binding-insert-mount/"">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Basic Summary</strong></p>

<p>Acquire the following: power drill, printed template, epoxy, a sharpie, drill bits slightly smaller than the binding screws (~3.6 mm), a pilot hole bit, a ruler, C-clamps, and a sturdy table.</p>

<p>Clamp the ski to the table. Find the center of the ski ""on the line"", the line printed on the ski from the factory.</p>

<p>Align the binding template, centered on the center point, and tape it down. Measure a lot.</p>

<p>Optional: Visually check by placing bindings over template and putting the boot in. Center-punch the template hole marks to ensure the bit won't skip on the ski's surface.</p>

<p>Once you are sure on the placement, tape a ""stopper"" around your drill bit(s) at about 9mm (standard wood screw thread length). Drill some holes.</p>

<p>Once holes are drilled, put a small amount of epoxy on each screw and screw bindings in.</p>

"How to cross a 25 feet wide Crevasse?","1774","","<p>How to cross a Crevasse when its absolutely unavoidable?
What gear/equipment is/are required?<br>
What are the things that one should look for when choosing where to cross?</p>

<p>Is it the hard ice from where I should cross, or is it the snow?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I am referring to a crevasse that I <em>may</em> need to cross some point in time during a trek that I am planning around Saser kangri II and Saser Kangri IV.
The said crevasses is roughly a 20-25 ft (6 to 7.5 m) wide.</p>
","<p>A crevasse that wide cannot just be jumped across (unless you're among the top long jumpers of the world), therefore you have only two possibilities: avoid it or build a bridge over it.</p>

<p>Typically such bridges are built using aluminum ladders (cf. image below) that are placed across the crevasse and fixed on both sides. In the ideal case one also builds some handrail rope to hold onto.</p>

<p><img src=""https://2012everestbasecamp.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/everest-l110-869.jpg"" alt=""crevasse""></p>

<p>As you can see from the image such bridges are rather permanent constructions, that need some material (ice screws, rope, webbing slings) to get it properly fixed. Also for a crevasse of 7.5m width you can plan for a minimum of 10m (better more) of ladder to have enough spare lengths on both sides for support and fixation. So this is nothing that you carry up the mountain just for the possibility to need it but you will have to plan ahead to bring the right material. It also requires some time to set it up, therefore such ladders are only of use on points where a crevasse is frequently crossed.</p>

<p>As you say you plan or at least expect to go solo on that trip, you won't have the capacity to carry huge amounts of material. In that case your second best choice will be to find a snow bridge over the crevasse.</p>

<p>As those bridges (and also the snowy edges of crevasses) can look firm while being quite unstable, be very careful with your safety measures. That means, create a save anchor (using ice screws, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_protection"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">snow protection gear</a>, or whatever is suitable for the conditions) some meters away from the edge and tie your rope there. Cross the snow bridge while you are belayed by the rope. Once on the other side, create another anchor there and fix your rope here as well. If you can afford, leave the rope there until you return to have an easier traverse on your way back (also take into account that you might need to take a fast retreat). If you can't leave the rope there, cross the bridge back again to your first anchor (of course while being secured by the rope somehow), remove the rope and anchor and get back to your second anchor by crossing the bridge a third time.</p>

<p>You see, the snow bridge variant requires to put your life onto some anchor built into snow with the risk of hanging on a rope somewhere down in the crevasse. You should be very sure to know how to rescue yourself from a crevasse and have the necessary gear with you. So in your situation it would clearly be the best choice to take a detour to avoid crossing the crevasse.</p>

<p>I would love to carry my Harmonica or a Flute with me ( being extremely portable as compared to a guitar), but what worries me more is that usually such wind instruments generate frequencies that are audible over a longer distance as compared to a guitar which is a string instrument (but hardly portable).</p>

"Leading an inexperienced group","1746","","<p>I'm taking a handful (5) work colleagues up a mountain this weekend (Tryfan in Snowdonia). </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WIDMp.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The mountain is a <code>Grade 1</code> scramble route so it's not overly simple. The group is very inexperienced. I've taken inexperienced people up said mountain a couple of times but never such a large group.</p>

<p>I've managed to rope in a couple of experienced friends to help out as I was wary that I couldn't keep my eye on everyone.  </p>

<p>I'm taking a rope (just in case). The route should be easily doable without a rope but I want to have a safety backup for anyone who is unsure. I've also ensured everyone is bringing the following kit:</p>

<ul>
<li>Walking boots</li>
<li>Waterproof jacket</li>
<li>Water</li>
<li>Food</li>
<li>Backpack</li>
<li>Sensible trousers</li>
<li>Warm clothing</li>
<li>Gloves</li>

<p>I'll be putting together a first aid kit.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any hints/tips/best practice ideas on how to manage such a group of people and keep everyone safe?</p>
","<p>There are few things which may go wrong:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Injury. Carry some kind of the shelter. It may take few hours for mountain rescue to get to your group.</p></li>
<li><p>Tired. Make sure you have alternative shorter and simpler route in your head.</p></li>
<li><p>Dehydrated. Carry a bit of extra water or a purification tablets to gather water from streams.</p></li>
<li><p>Scared. Your rope can serve a good purpose here, but personally I wouldn't use it as it often gives a false safety feeling. Keeping group in a good mood is much more efficient.</p></li>
<li><p>Bored. Make sure everybody is having fun. Don't forget to check with everybody and make sure they are doing ok.</p></li>
<li><p>Cold. Usually I carry extra fleece just in case.</p></li>
<li><p>Wet. A pair of dry socks and mac-a-pack can help a lot. Even if you ask everybody to bring waterproofs and proper hiking boots, often they ignore that or borrow damaged or old equipment from friends or get it on the eBay.</p></li>
<li><p>Sun burned. I always have a sunscreen to share with the group.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That's just from my personal experience. I'm sure there are many more things which may go wrong. Usually I'm leading 10 - 20 people groups of people with mixed experience.</p>

<p>One good tip for a first aid kit for townies group is to take gloves and tweezers. It doesn't matter if you'll remove a bee or a thorn from someones arm with your nails or tweezers, but that person will be much more confident about you doing that if you look 'professional'.</p>

","<h1>Foreword</h1>

<p>I fear it will be a bit complicated to get scientific reference for the answers to your questions as those things might be important but too less to be published. Therefore most of the evidence may be hidden somewhere in the corporate knowledge of the hammer drill manufacturers. Nonetheless I will try to answer you question on my experience in construction work and physics.</p>

<p>First of all I think we should set the reference frame for what we're talking about. As you already mentioned in your question, you will want to get a tool that is somewhere on the lower end of the heavy duty tools. This will include a SDS shank for the drill bits and a real hammering mechanism, not just that ratchet like vibrator module that you find in rather cheap hardware store machines. So you will end in the segment of machines that are typically sold to construction companies for their daily stuff like drilling some holes for anchors, demolish some smaller piece of wall or concrete or the like. That is typically also the type of tools you can rely on – you don't want your machine to fail in the middle of a wall.</p>

<h1>Requirements</h1>

<h3>RPM &amp; BPM</h3>

<p>Unfortunately the requirements are bit different when bolting climbing anchors: the typical performance figures to characterize those machines will not hold in your case. When bolting climbing routes you often drill holes while hanging in your harness, therefore you will not be able to apply the force that you would when standing stable on a floor and pushing against the drill with all you have. Therefore RPMs and BPMs are not of great importance as you quite surely in most cases will not be able to use them to all their extent.</p>

<h3>Voltage</h3>

<p>Another thing is the power you need: As a rule of thumb the power scales with the battery voltage. But as you drill rather small holes (10mm to 12mm I would guess) you don't need maximum power. The machines in the range you should look for will anyways be in the 24V to 36V range. Instead, you will want some battery lifetime as you won't be near a wall plug, where you can just recharge your batteries, when bolting a route. So instead of investing in higher battery voltage you better might invest in a high-capacity battery or a second battery pack.</p>

<h3>Weight</h3>

<p>Then there's the factor weight: on the one hand you will want a light tool as you will have to carry it to remote places and up a wall. The heavier the tool on the other side, the less force you need to push it against the wall while drilling as inertia will be on your side here.</p>

<h3>Drill Bits</h3>

<p>Finally, don't forget about the drill bits. Here it is the same as for the machine itself: don't get the next best cheap ones from the hardware store down the road. Good drill bits don't just work longer but can also ease your life while drilling. From the Hilti company I know that they have constructed their drill bits in a way that they work somehow ""in sync"" with the hammering mechanism of their machines, therefore you need less force to push the machine against the wall – you more or less only have to hold the machine to prevent it from falling out of the hole. Sounds magic, but really makes a difference and you learn to love it when you drill the n-th hole that day.</p>

<h3>Noise &amp; Vibration</h3>

<p>Concerning your additional points: For the noise level, in doubt just get a set of ear plugs, but I don't think, there will be much difference between the different tools. Acceleration/vibrations shouldn't be that much of a problem, as you will not drill hole after hole all the day but you will do a lot of other things in between.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h1>TL;DR</h1>
  
  <p>Don't care too much about the usual specs but get a tool that is
  rather lightweight with long battery lifetime.</p>

"Is a .22 air-rifle powerful enough for a clean kill of a rabbit?","1713","","<p>Many many years ago me and my brothers used to go rabbit hunting with air-rifles.

<p>What muzzle velocity would be adequate?</p>

","<p>It looks like because you are in the UK, there is a power restriction, which means that you can either go high velocity, lightweight pellet or a low velocity heavy pellet. If that restriction wasn't there, more power would make for cleaner kills.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Regardless of calibre, all standard air rifles are <strong>restricted in power output to a maximum of 12 ft/lb.</strong> Whether they are pre-charged or spring-powered.</p>
  
  <p>A full-power legal .177 rifle firing an 8.5-gr pellet at around 800fps, or a .22 air rifle firing a 16-gr pellet at around 580fps would be perfectly capable of killing a rabbit at normal ranges up to 35-40 yards.</p>

<p>As for how close, that depends more on how good a shot you are. What I would do is make a circle that is the size of a rabbit's head on a target, and then see from how far away you can consistently hit it. I would doubt that it would be over 50 yards if that.</p>

There are modern counterparts to all of these. Canned food is not a good choice if you're carrying the food on your backs. Dehydrated and freeze-dried foods are your best bet, combined with non-perishable items that you might normally eat. Foods like crackers, roasted nuts, dried fruit, chocolate, granola bars, etc. are good for uncooked quick meals. You can purchase dried milk which can be reconstituted with water and eaten with dry cereal. For hot meals items like rice, couscous, and pasta are common. There are many types of commercially available prepared meals which you just add hot water to. </p>

<p>The key is to avoid anything which would go bad without refrigeration. I suspect that if you look around your pantry at home you'll find all kinds of items you regularly eat that keep well without refrigeration. Four days isn't very long, and even things like bread and fresh fruit will keep over that amount of time, though they may be heavier than you wish to carry. </p>

<p>Regarding your modified question asking how to keep perishable items safe to eat... there really isn't any way to do that. If it's perishable, it needs refrigeration. This can work in cold environments, but for trekking in the jungle, it's simply going to be impractical from a weight perspective. You're better off bringing non-perishable food items.</p>

"How can a barbed wire fence be crossed safely?","1688","","<p>How can one cross a barbed wire fence safely?</p>

<p>Assumptions: Height of the person: 5.8 (172cm) Distance between barb wires is roughly 9 inches (20-22 cm), Fence is 4 to 4.5 (120-140cm) feet tall, not electrified. The guy is alone, hauling a backpack.</p>

<p>Lets not start getting into should one cross a barbed wire fence.</p>
","<p>I'd climb the fence at a post. First, place /throw you backpack over the fence as climbing with it on is significantly more difficult, especially if heavy.</p>

<p>Climb the fence, with at least one hand on the fence post and your feet one the wires, in between the barbs, as close to the post as reasonable. Being close to the fencepost minimizes the chance of you breaking the fence and is more stable. With your other hand either hold the wire, being careful not to grab a barb, or put both hands on the fencepost. When you are sufficiently high swing one leg over being careful not to catch yourself on the top barbs and place your foot in the fence on the other side. Either twist your foot around or put your heel in on the wire if you are less flexible. Carefully get your other leg over and climb or jump down.</p>

<p>This method is easiest for lowish fences where you can just take one step on the fence and get your leg over. I wouldn't do it for anything over about 4 1/2 ft as the top of the fence may get quite unstable when you put your weight on it at that height.</p>

<p>The disadvantages of this approach is that it is quite easy to catch your leg/crotch on the top wire and rip your trousers as you don't want to climb higher than necessary (climbing higher is less stable). Also if you feel you are losing balance don't grab the barbed wire, jump off. It may sound obvious but your natural reaction is to steady yourself and the wire is generally the most obvious thing to grab.</p>

"What's the best way to swap lead when climbing in a group of three using a pair of half ropes?","1684","","<p>On a multi-pitch route when all climbers have reached the belay point, what is the best way/what considerations need to be made, in order to swap lead? Obviously the leader will need to be tied into both ropes, but the second will be tied into only one.  </p>

<p>Update:
I appreciate the answer to this question is ""Not to swap lead"" in this scenario and appreciate the safety aspects involved, but carried out my own investigation under controlled conditions.</p>

<p>So myself and two friends climbed Bosigran ridge using a pair of half ropes. With various belays being large and flat, swapping lead was not too difficult. </p>

<p>In one instance we had a hanging belay. After establishing the anchor over a spike I belayed the seconds (one at a time), coiling the rope over my personal anchor. When the seconds had both arrived I untied one of my ropes (red) and gave it to the climber who was not leading the next pitch. He tied a safety with this. He then untied his other rope and handed it to the other second, who then tied in. That climber was now ready to lead the next pitch. He climbed and there was little tangling/snagging in the ropes as he went (he climbed un-impeded). </p>

<p>I think in this instance we may have been quite lucky not to create a big mess and since it was the last pitch any further tangling was avoided. One thing to note was that I passed one of my ropes underneath the coils so as not to create tangles, and both of the ends of rope that the final leader used, we emerging from the top of the pile.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong></p>

<p>i can now say with great certainty, from much experience, that climbing in a 3 and swapping leads, is not only easy and safe, but proper ace</p>
","<p>I love doing routes with 3 people. Once you are efficient at it, those don't take much longer than going with 2 people, you have someone to talk to when the leader is taking forever, and you have an additional hand, if you need it (for taking pictures, dealing with rope tangle, keeping an eye out on the weather, another belayer if the leader gets in trouble...)</p>

<p>You specified <b><a href=""http://www.abc-of-rockclimbing.com/howto/ropesystems.asp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">half-ropes</a></b>, which pretty much only leaves you with one option: You <b>don't</b> swap leads. You have a designated leader. The alternative is a big untying mess at the anchor with three people and two ropes. Absolutely not recommended, and unsafe in my opinion.</p>

<p>Here are some things to consider when you belay two people from a belay anchor: Make sure you have an appropriate belay device (ATC guide or reverso,) and you know how to use it in it's auto-locking mode. Practice belaying two ropes that are moving at different speeds, <b>without taking your break hand off!</b> This is important, even though the devices mentioned above are auto locking. If you are belaying from a ledge, I find it much more efficient to just stack each rope on it's own pile, and then have each climber re-stack their pile once they are safely attached to the anchor. If you are not on a ledge, you have three options:</p>

<ul>
<li>1) stack both ropes as if you were belaying one second and are getting ready to lead the next pitch (your <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/4109/what-to-do-with-the-lap-coiled-rope-if-the-belayer-wishes-to-lead-consecutive-pi"">previous question</a>). This is the least amount of hassle, but both climbers have to climb at the same speed, and each climber has to be aware of how much slack is building up.</li>
<li>2) Buy a rope hook, or use a sling clipped to your belay loop and one gear loop to stack one of the ropes, making coils (small to large), and use the rope with which you are tied to the anchor to do the same with the other rope. This is slow and complicated. You also have to be careful that the second and third are not getting twisted once they are at the anchor. This you just have to practice, I find it impossible to list everything to look out for (someone else might not?) Once both climbers are at the anchor, flip and give each their rope back.</li>
<li>3) Buy two rope bags that can be used as rope buckets and proceed as if you were on a ledge.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are using ropes that are also rated as <b>single ropes</b> you have one additional option: Either the second or the third can lead on one strand, belay the second up, who will be attached to two ropes (one of which is trailing), and finally belaying the third up. I have done this, and it is fine, but you asked for ""the best way,"" which this is not. Not swapping leads and leading up on two ropes is more efficient, since you can belay both, the second and the third simultaneously, given you have an ATC guide or a reverso.</p>

<p>In case you were curious why you can't to the latter with two half-ropes: It would mean that one climber is leading on one half-rope, which is not what they are rated for, unless they definitively state so. I do have a rope that is rated as both, and there are even ropes that are rated as singe- half- and twin.</p>

<p>As a closing remark: I would suggest being really comfortable with the system of one leader and one second before you take a third, both with swapping leads and one leader leading every pitch. Rope management becomes exponentially more difficult with two ropes, and everything becomes just a little less neat and intuitive at the anchors. As a bonus, here are a couple of skills that you should know before you even attempt to do a multi-pitch climb: Rappel without a rappel device (<a href=""http://vimeo.com/34349494"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">on a munter hitch</a> or <a href=""http://www.chockstone.org/TechTips/CrabBrake.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a carabiner break</a>), <a href=""http://www.climbing.com/skill/munter-magic/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">belay a second from the anchor with a munter hitch</a>, <a href=""http://www.climbing.com/skill/preferred-knots-for-rappelling/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">joining two ropes with the appropriate knot</a>, being able to defend why you chose that knot, know how to back up a rappel with a <a href=""http://climbing.about.com/od/climbingknots/ss/HowTieAutoblock.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">prussic loop</a> and <a href=""http://www.chockstone.org/TechTips/RapBackup.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">fireman's belay</a>, know how to <a href=""http://www.chockstone.org/TechTips/AscendRope.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ascend a rope with two prussics</a> and how to back up your ascend with backup knots, know how to build multidirectional SRENE anchors (I guess this one is an obvious one), know how to escape a belay...

"Tent inside of a tent- any improvement in warmth?","1681","","<p>I know that a pocket of still air is an excellent insulator. </p>

<p>Would placing a tent inside of another tent provide any substantive benefits to warmth? For a concrete example, consider placing a small two person dome tent inside of a much larger 6 or 8 person family tent.</p>

<p>I'm interested in comparing tent alone / tent with fly / tent in tent.</p>
","<p>That's essentially how 4 season tents work, the tent is full nylon (no mesh) and the fly is full and basically acts as a second tent, creating that air gap. some 4 season tents even have little foamies on them that help keep the gap, preventing snow from squishing the fly against the tent and eliminating that insulating volume:</p>

<p>Putting a tent inside another tent would work, but it would work better if the tents were closer in size, then you wouldn't have a large of a volume of air to try and warm. </p>

<p>If you really want to insulate your tent, try putting a blanket or old sleeping bag in between the tent and the fly. In a pinch you can use dry grass or leaves, that's what Siberians do, they make a shelter inside of a shelter and fill the gap in-between with grass.</p>

"Any dangerous animals attracted to fire?","1680","","<p>While we are out in the wild it's good practice to keep a fire up to hold back several kinds of dangerous animals, isn't it? I wonder if there are any (for humans dangerous) creatures out there which are attracted to fire/light?</p>

<p>One might want to know in which regions he should avoid setting up a hell of a campfire. </p>
","<p>Two parts to this answer: First, I am playing around with some statistics on assaults and murders in the US National Parks, and I am coming to the conclusion that the most dangerous animal in the outdoors is homo sapiens, who will be attracted by your fire.</p>

<p>Second, maybe 20 years ago I read a speculation by a respected anthropologist, the gist of which was that fire was a necessary precursor to whatever the precursor of speech was.  (Fire appeared maybe 700,000 years ago, and speech in the modern sense maybe 50,000 years ago, with large error bars on both.)  His point -- it may have been Leakey, but I can't remember -- was that if you are sitting in the dark, you are quiet, because you are <strong>listening</strong> -- listening for the approach of something that will eat you, literally.   Fire kept these animals away and enabled communal jabber.  </p>

<p>On this second point, remember the scene in <em>2001, A Space Odyssey</em>, where the anthropoids are sitting huddled together at night, scared, and listening, with their eyes darting in all directions. That scene would have been very different if they had had a fire. </p>

<p>The two parts of this answer may seem contradictory.  If animals are plentiful and enemy homo scarce, then the fire is a deterrent.  If animals are scarce and enemy homo plentiful, then the fire is not wise.</p>

"Hiking popularity in North America vs. Europe","1658","","<p>From browsing this site, I have learned that US national parks and wilderness areas have <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/q/1819/566"">restrictions</a> and that campsites need <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/q/3509/566"">reservations</a>, sometimes months in advance. I've never seen anything like it in Europe; in popular areas, there are simply many campsites and one meets hundreds of people per day (in extreme cases hundreds per hour) on the hiking trails, whereas in remote regions, there are no campsites and one meets nobody (in fact, one usually meets less than 10 people/day once more than two hours from the parking place). It's supply and demand. I haven't seen a full camp-site since 1994, and I've been camping every year.</p>

<p>North America has a lot of sparsely populated areas, probably more than Europe. This makes me wonder — <strong>how crowded do those hiking trails get</strong>? For example, suppose that one has obtained a permit for hiking + camping in the wild in Yosemite National Park. Since this is subject to a quota (correct me if I'm wrong), the total number of people hiking at a given moment should be pretty easy to know. How many people should one expect to meet under such circumstances, order of magnitude? 1 per day? 10? 100? Are quota set so that every hiker can have the opportunity to feel alone in the world, or so that hikers won't completely overrun the national park and destroy it?</p>

<p>Where does the difference between Europe and North America come from? Is nature in North America more sensitive than in Europe, is the demand for hiking much higher, or do hikers in North America concentrate even more in a few small areas than in Europe? </p>
","<p>I'm not sure you can generalize US Hiking trails, since there will be vast variability in popularity, usage, land area, population density etc. (Just as you mentioned is the case in popular vs. remote areas of Europe).</p>

<p>Yes, there are some areas that require reservations, but most don't. In fact, I feel comfortable saying MOST federal public land in the western US have no quotas, no reservation system, no anything. In many of those, you won't see another soul for days. Other areas might be equally unregulated and have wall-to-wall people.</p>

<p>In the answers here: ""<a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/1819/when-do-i-need-a-permit-to-go-into-nature"">When do I need a permit to go into nature?</a>"" I list some of the agencies that have different approaches to land management, and point out it varies so widely that any generalization is impossible.</p>

<p>To answer this: <em>""Are quota set so that every hiker can have the opportunity to feel alone in the world, or so that hikers won't completely overrun the national park and destroy it?""</em> <strong>Yes</strong>: Wilderness areas (congressionally designated Wilderness with a capital ""W"" -- see below) have a legal mandate to limit users so your encounter rates are small. How that is interpreted varies by the agency administering the area (some shoot for less than 2 groups encountered per day). By contrast, some popular areas of National Forests or Parks might limit usage based on the maximum visitation possible before total annihilation of the resource.</p>

<p>Often, even within a National Park or Forest, there are different usage areas with different quotas, or no quota at all...

<p>As for the philosophical underpinnings, the US has vast amounts of empty space, and lots of people would like to keep it that way. Above and beyond the Public Lands System (Parks, Forests, Seashores, Grasslands, Recreation Areas, etc) a far-minded group passed the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilderness_Act"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wilderness Act of 1964</a> to take land preservation to the N'th degree.

  expanding settlement and growing mechanization, does not occupy and
  modify all areas within the United States and its possessions, leaving
  no lands designated for preservation and protection in their natural
  condition, it is hereby declared to be the policy of the Congress to
  secure for the American people of present and future generations the
  benefits of an enduring resource of wilderness.</em></p>

<p>However its takes a lot of time and effort if I need to take out an item at the bottom or at the middle and repacking everything back. Sometimes I get tired I just stash everything inside my pack. </p>

<p>So how do you keep your backpack stuff organized and keep your sanity? Am I doing something wrong?</p>
","<p>I have always viewed packing of backpack in terms of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ease of access.</li>
<li>Distribution of weight to prevent unwanted strain.</li>
</ul>

<p>Distribution of weight is a very important aspect that you have to consider while trekking for a longer duration. Ideally, the heavier things should be closer to your body and the lighter ones away from you. The logic being, the center of gravity will shift awkwardly away from your body if the heavier stuff is too far away from your body. </p>

<p>Having said that, ease of access is also important. I have learnt over the years that there is no right way to pack to meet all your criteria. One thing that I do to allow for better organisation is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use plastic bags to compartmentalize your stuff. Usually trekking bags have one big compartment and you are forced to stuff everything into it.</li>
<li>Group similar items together and keep them at one place. Eg: All my electronic stuff go into one pouch. All my toiletries go in together into a plastic cover. Similarly, all your warm clothes can go into one plastic bag, your normal clothes into another and so on.</li>

"Camping with a tarp, what are risks about animals?","1649","","<p>I have never camped using a tarp (and just a sleeping bag under), and I am wondering about it. I am thinking about camping in Canada, and the animals around there are apparently mostly bears and other animals from the hills.</p>

<p>To avoid bears, the best advice is put your food far enough from where you camp, so I am not so afraid, especially compared to a tent. However, I am more worried about small animals and snakes. I suppose there are few, but since the tarp is not closed, I am wondering about what risks I am taking. I will be backcountry-camping, i.e. not next to RVs with lots of humans.</p>

<p>So, compared to using a tent, are there serious risks linked to animals when using a tarp?</p>
","<p>It's not animals you really need to worry about, it's <strong>bugs</strong>. I pack a tent to keep out of the bugs more than I do to keep the critters out. The only time I can ever remember having issues with animals was in the Ptolemy Plateau, for some reason there were a lot of gophers, and they were all over our campsite at night, scratching at the walls of out tent and even trying to come up from underneath. We spent the night playing whack-a-mole. The small critters that will approach your bed at night don't pose any risk, they're just a serious annoyance while you're trying to sleep.</p>

<p>Bears and other scavengers are a non-issue as long as you keep all of the sweet smells a long ways away from your bed, this includes food, tooth paste, deodorant, gum, <em>anything</em> with a smell–doesn't matter if it's packaged or freeze dried, bears and Candis can smell through packages and bags–if it has a smell, put it in a cache. If there's nothing but you and your stinky human stench in your sleeping bag, then you can be pretty confident that all the big critters in your vicinity will leave you alone.</p>

<p>The smaller critters... well, pack rats will make off with your keys and eat a hole in the foot of your expensive sleeping bag so they can get fluff for their beds. If you're at a backcountry campground that has ropes in the trees, it's to hang your gear off the ground so nothing gets stolen by the local wildlife. Last camp I went on with a big group, we carried an extra tent just to store all of our gear in at night, but there were also people there sleeping under tarps. I think it really boils down to whatever you're more comfortable with. Myself, I'm ok with carrying the extra weight so I can have the extra comfort at night, keeps my gear cleaner too. </p>

<p>As far as risks, I don't think there are any more risks using a tarp than there are using a tent. You put yourself more at risk to exposure than you do to wildlife. But if it's something you're going to worry about, then you might just get a better nights sleep in a tent where you're not going to be up all night paranoid that something's going to slither up to your face in the middle of the night.</p>

"What might cause a massive blood stream from a lethally hit moose's mouth?","1645","","<p>I've recently watched a commercial videos for a broadhead model. A guy brought down a massive moose bull with a compound bow. Despite going down really fast, the bull does something which I've never seen or experienced before. It starts to gag a lot of blood! The arrow hits the animal and a few seconds later a massive blood stream comes out of the game's mouth.</p>

<p>The link below is a still from the video (<em>be careful - explicit</em>):<br>
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lbCPk.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://i.stack.imgur.com/lbCPk.png</a></p>

<p>You can find the video here starting at second 78 (<em>caution</em>, hunting footage with explicit content): <a href=""https://youtu.be/PzRTb5WwfaA?t=78"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">YouTube - (...) (B)ull moose gets (shot) at 12 yards (...)</a></p>

<p>What causes this massive bloodstream? </p>
","<p>A normally lethal shot with a bow hits both lungs and possibly the heart.  This shot was interesting because the arrow didn't go very far in and probably only hit one lung.  I haven't hunted moose, but have shot elk, and most of my shots go completely through the animal.  Sometimes a bone gets in the way and if you watch the arrow in the video right after it impacts, there is still a good deal of shaft left exposed and the nock end seems to immediately get levered to the front of the moose.  This is probably because the shot entered just behind the leg/shoulder structure.  As the leg levered the arrow around, the broadhead that is inside the animal should cut a huge swath of tissue causing a good amount of bleeding inside the lung.  </p>

<p>The shallow hit on an animal that size probably means a bone strike and it didn't get both lungs, but the one lung that is hit was cut open internally.  Lung shots do two things to the animal, the first is that the blood loss from the wound can be significant because of the amount of blood that flows through the lungs.  The other effect is immobilizing the lungs and making them stop oxygenating the blood by filling the lung cavity with blood or with air that leaks out of the lung hole (called a tension pnuemothorax).  The elk I have seen that have been lung shot wind-down just like this one did in the video.  If you are tracking a wounded deer/elk/moose and suspect this type of wound and dying pattern, you can get tricked by the track they make because as they die, they get weaker and possibly dizzy.  If you start to track them up a hill and the track suddenly dies, backtrack downhill or through the path of least resistance and you will often find your animal.  You will often see pinkish tissue in the blood trail at some point where bits of the shredded lung are blown out through the mouth, and this lets you know you probably had a good lung shot.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a heart shot will stop the blood pumping fairly quickly and there will be less blood to track, but shorter trail to follow.  The first elk I ever shot I punched right through the shoulder blade and had a somewhat shallow strike.  I watched the elk run off with the arrow flagging just like the one in the video here.  The elk ran up a hill a few yards and just fell down stone dead.  When I opened the chest cavity, the moving broadhead had severed the aorta right off the heart and made for a very quick death and no tracking required.</p>

"Do alpine boots hurt when walking (not climbing)?","1644","","<p>This question reffers to ""single"" alpine climbing boots used for mountaineering with a stiff 3/4 to full shank, not heavy duty backpacking boots or ""double"" (plastic) boots. I have owned two pairs of climbing boots, both of which have caused foot pain and/or blisters on many trips. While climbing 3rd to 5th class rock or climbing vertical ice/snow, I appriciate the stiff shank and am able to stand in my crampons and climb in boots just fine with no pain. However, most of the climbing in my area requires long and sometimes bushy approaches on anything from level ground to steep hills. I find my feet start to really hurt on the approach (even more so on the walks back to the car) as the boots are so stiff and hard on my feet they seem to really pound with each step. </p>

<p>I guess I'd like to know, as the boots are designed for climbing, should I always just expect this when walking on flat/moderate terrain? </p>
","<p>I am not entirely sure, but I think you are referring to boots like the <a href=""http://www.sportiva.com/products/footwear/mountain/nepal-evo-gtx"">La Sportiva Nepal</a>.</p>

<p>In this case, while these shoes are as you mentioned designed primarerly for technical mountaineering, you should not expect these sort of problems. I did my military service mostly in these boots and we did a lot of marching on flat concrete. While this is a shameful misuse of great boots, it did not result in hurting feet. There are a few points in the design that make it less practical for flat walking though, but some of thame can be remedied:</p>

<ul>
<li>You mentioned the stiff shank:<br>
This gets a whole lot better if you do not tie the shoelace too hard in the upper shoe lace hooks and leave out the top shoe lace hooks.</li>
<li>Much more of a problem is the stiff sole with almost no damping. This makes your walking very harsh to your knees. This is the main reason why I would not recommend these kind of shoes for walking. With time, you learn to roll as smoothly as possible while walking, but it still is quite bad.</li>
</ul>

<p>But despite these two points, if these shoes fit, they should not cause hurting feets. Even in mountaineering you have to walk and they are designed to do this. It seems like the model you use does not entirely suit you. Very often a personaly optimized sole can help that problem.</p>

<p>Summarizing: You should not expect hurting feets from walking in these boots, but they are not optimal for flat terrain. For this I advise to use some sort of approach shoe to personal taste. That can be anything from a running shoes to dedicated climbing approach shoes.</p>

"How to estimate distance in sea","1644","","<p>While kayaking or swimming out in the open waters, it is quite important to be able to judge distances accurately before attempting to get from one point to another, such as from island to island. Without a map, a GPS and a good geographical knowledge of the area, it can be quite a daunting aspect. </p>

<p>With no landmarks in between to serve as a gauge, is there a method to judge distances with a fair degree of accuracy, for example from one spot to a desolated island in a distance? </p>

<p>When would one consider it to be too far to make an attempt?</p>
","<p>On water, you can use the curvature of the earth to help you, and change your height instead of moving. According to the <a href=""http://www.boatsafe.com/kids/distance.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">Boat Safe Kids</a> web site, the formula for how far away the visible horizon is over water (in other words, how far you can see) is </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1.17 * sqrt(eye height in feet) = (distance in miles)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While <a href=""http://www.wikihow.com/Calculate-the-Distance-to-the-Horizon"" rel=""nofollow"">wikihow</a> says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>sqrt (1.5 * eye height in feet) = (distance in miles)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They can't both be right, because the sqrt(1.5) is 1.22. But they're pretty close.</p>

<p>So by standing in your boat, getting your eye 5 feet above the water, you can see 2.6 or 2.7 miles. Sitting down, your eye might be 3 feet above the water, and you can see 2.0 or 2.1 miles. If you can actually see where the water meets that island you're thinking of swimming or paddling to, it is less than that distance away. Using binoculars or your camera's zoom to confirm you are seeing the beach and not some trees above the horizon would probably be smart.</p>

"What trees/bushes are best suited for a simple bow?","1640","","<p>This question is about the simple type of bow often (but not exclusively :) ) made by children that consists of a branch of wood with a cord tied to both its ends. Obviously such a branch should be straight and uniformly thick. Furthermore there is the question of how much force it can take. I experienced that wood from certain brushes/trees can take more force (at the same diameter) than others.</p>

<p>Which trees/bushes make good bows, i.e. can take a lot of force?</p>

<p>Please also give a reference in what region those types can be found. I am asking from a middle european standpoint, but answers for other regions are welcome as well.</p>
","<p>There are two important factors when bowmaking:</p>

<ul>
<li>Flexibiliy, i.e. how easy the wood is to bend</li>
<li>Strength, i.e. how much force you can put into the wood before it breaks.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are just interested in a toy bow that doesn't shoot to hard or far then flexibility is your main concern. You want thinnish green wood which tends to be the most flexible.</p>

<p>If you want to build a more proper bow the strength of the wood is also important as it needs to take the load you are putting in.</p>

<p>For specific woods, the traditional English longbow is made of Yew which is probably one of the best bow making woods in Europe (note: English yew is poisonous so be careful while handling it).</p>

<p>Other wood traditionally used for longbows according to wikipedia include ash, elm, hazel and laburnum so these are other good options.</p>

","<p>If you are referring to Crataegus, then yes Hawthorne is edible, the pomes are like tiny apples with two flower spots on the bottom. It is commonly made into jelly, syrups and country wine.</p>

<p>Regarding the seed, you want to pull this out after cooking the pome just like you would the heavy solids of any other fruit. I know you mention raspberry and black berry as examples of some where you don't have to, but it my opinion the seeds ruin the jelly, and I buy and make seedless jellies.</p>

<li><strong>As Food and Hydration:</strong> If you are trapped on an Island (Refer: Castaway) probably Coconut Water can be only major source of potable water for you. As a bonus though, it contains a lot of nutrients, a great source of glucose and Potassium. Coconut meat, the white substance is totally edible, it contains Vitamin A and E.</li>
<li><strong>Amazing Tinder:</strong> Coconut tree petioles and leaves are fibrous, so they burn very well and produce a lot of charcoal which you can use as a fire-started. Also, the dry coconut shell will burn well.</li>
<li><strong>Skin Care:</strong> Coconut meat and Coconut Oil can also be used as a Sunscreen and/or as a Moisturizer. </li>
<li><strong>Medical Usage:</strong> One can squish coconut meat to get Coconut oil from it which has anti-fugal, anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, anti-viral contents. </li>
<li><strong>Hard shell:</strong> A coconut shell cut into half can be used as a bowl, and the fresh green coconut can be used to carry nearly 500 ml water, depending upon size of the coconut.</li>
<li><strong>Floats for emergency rafts:</strong> Coconuts float very well,so if you at all you want to make a raft, you can pad coconuts below the logs. </li>
<li><strong>String and rope:</strong> The fiber threads extracted from a petiole of coconut tree can help you tie and lash many things, right from a hunting trap (wait, if needed) to as a shoelace. </li>

"How do I achieve/maintain optimal hydration?","1607","","<p>I am curious about some techniques/guidelines for achieving and maintaining optimal hydration while performing moderate to high strain outdoor activities, such as long hikes etc.  IOW, how do you hydrate yourself JUST ENOUGH, not too much, not too little.</p>

<p>The reason that I am asking is that I noticed that, when not sweating too much and not peeing, I don't need too much water.  Excessive water intake causes more urination, which means you have to make more frequent stops and also your organism ""learns"" to use more water, i.e. gets adjusted.  So I am thinking there could be techniques for optimal and balanced hydration that do not rely simply on thirst or a pre set water intake schedule and instead is perhaps a function of drinking water only after urination and in the amount that is approximately commensurate to the amount of urine.</p>
","<p>The absolute best way to figure out when to drink is by paying attention to your thirst. </p>

<p>If you drink a cup of water when you aren't really thirsty, your body will start getting rid of excess fluid within a few minutes. But if you drink that same cup when you are seriously dehydrated, you won't pee it out because your body won't have excessive moisture. This is all related to how much fluid is in your body, not the time since your last urination.</p>

<p>If you want to avoid peeing any more than you have to, get very, very familiar with how you feel when you are just slightly dehydrated (a tiny bit thirsty, but not excessively so, and certainly not unpleasantly so). Then drink small amounts frequently when you start feeling that way. Have a couple of swallows: that will momentarily slake your thirst. Then if you are thirsty again in 5 minutes, repeat this. If you drink large amounts, you are more likely to drink enough to completely rehydrate completely, and need to pee again. It will take experimentation to figure out exactly how much you need to drink, and what you should feel like, but once you do, it's quite reliable.</p>

<p>If you are trying this, and don't drink enough, you can get seriously dehydrated, especially if you are sweating a lot. So be cautious when you are starting out, and err on the side of drinking more. Also, at the end of the day, it's a good idea to rehydrate completely, both for your own comfort, and because urination is very important for the body to rid itself of toxins.</p>

"Trekking solo in Western Ghats, India","1604","","<p>I have read a few blogs about people and their solo trekking experiences. At the first glance at it, 'whether to trek solo or not' sounds like an opinion based thing, but I wonder if there are any valid sources advicing about whether to go or not. I am planning for a trek (well marked, popular trail) in Western Ghats. I have ample amount of experience in trekking, and I have the essential knowledge about the route that I am planning to take.</p>

<p>However, having all the required information regarding the route and wildlife, I still lack any information on issues like:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Exit point in case of emergency (Agumbe - Narasimhaparvata - Sringeri trail)  </li>
<li>Reports of Local threats like plundering, thefts, and safety of individual women.  </li>
<li>Threat from any sort of organized and/or unorganized crime (These are one of the reasons for which I was denied to travel alone from Kathmandu to Lukla by possible public transport)</li>
</ul>
","<p>The quick answer to a question of credible sources for solo trekking trails is, ""NO"", there are no sources which can be completely relied on for this kind of information (at least for the western ghats part).</p>

<p>The following set of attributes might help you in deciding upon heading out solo in the western ghats:</p>

<p><strong>Safety:</strong> <br>
The western ghats are safe for trekking. I haven't come across any trail which can be classified as ""dangerous"" in terms of the danger from robbers/people etc. However, some trails are relatively riskier than others (eg Agumbe trek) due to the naxal threats. Poachers are a danger in densely forested trails(But I guess you are not venturing into these). There is very little threat from animals while on the well established trails. Off beat trails around thick forests are riskier due to elephants, snakes and poachers.</p>

<p><strong>Grade of treks:</strong> <br>
Most of the well established treks in the western ghats are of easy-moderate difficulty. The only one that I consider mildly difficult is ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushpagiri"" rel=""nofollow"">Kumara Parvata</a>"". </p>

<p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> <br>
All the treks in the western ghats are accessible through a nearby town/village. These places are cost effective and people are very welcoming. The chances of being coned are lesser than what you would find in the northern part of India.</p>

<p><strong>When to trek the western ghats?</strong><br>
Do not venture during monsoon and summer. Summer heat is intensified by the thick forest cover and monsoons are just uncomfortable due to the heavy rainfall.</p>

<p><strong>Camping and other facilities:</strong><br>
On some of the trekking spots, camping is not allowed. This is mainly because these spots lie in the range of a reserve forest or a sanctuary. Some of the trails might require you to get a permit from the forest department to even enter the trails. Some trails might require guides. Water, although available in the form of streams is not completely reliable. A better option would be to carry water purifying filter. None of the trails have facilities in terms of proper camping sites. It's entirely up to you how you setup your campsite. </p>

<p><strong>Exit routes</strong><br>
Always remember, in case you get into trouble(either due to an injury or an animal attack), the exit routes on western ghats are difficult. Two reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>The forests are thick, facilities are less.</li>
<li>The general health facilities in smaller towns and villages are not that well developed in India. (Most of the trails lie closer to the villages and towns than the well developed cities).</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, do remember that there are loads of blogs on the net which can give you information regarding the trails. But whether to trek solo or not is a purely personal choice. If you are okay with being alone on a hilltop/forest with no civilization nearby, western ghats are pretty good (Always keep in mind that, in case you get into trouble, most probably there is <em>no medical evacuation by air</em>). You will find trekking groups, but very few camp out (most of the trails can be done in a day).</p>

<p><strong>EDIT: Route for Agumbe trail:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Safety: No threat from locals. Locals are friendly and welcoming. This is a naxal area. Possibility of encountering wildlife if trekking solo (mostly snakes).</li>
<li>Grade: Moderate. (Some sections are steep)</li>
<li>Accessibility: From mallandur, the peak is around 14km away(shortest route). You will need a guide if trekking from Agumbe side. The forest is very thick and there are multiple routes(none of the trails are well marked). Route from Kigga side is well marked.</li>
<li>Forest permit: Required. Recommended to have the contact number of an ANF official as well (Anti Naxal Forces).</li>
<li>Camping: Allowed at the top. No need to carry excessive water. A flowing stream and a well are available at the top.</li>
<li>Exit routes: None. You'll have to trek back to your starting point to get to any human habitation.</li>

","<p>You don't want to immobilize a dislocated shoulder.  You really need to fix it.  Even if held at just the right angle and not being jostled around, a dislocated shoulder <b>hurts</b>.  After a while the muscles will tighten, then start spasming periodically.  Then it <b>really hurts</b> and it becomes much more difficult to get it back in.</p>

<p>There are some dangers in getting a shoulder popped back in by a non-expert, but the downsides and practical near impossibility of hiking out any distance with a dislocated shoulder outweigh them.</p>

<p>Once the shoulder is popped back in, the person will immediately feel better.  It will be sore and will be in danger of popping out again easily, but it won't hurt anymore.  <i>Now</i> is the time to arrange some sort of sling to keep the lower arm roughly accross the belly and tied down so that it isn't used, even if accidentally.  Little things we normaly can take for granted can pop it out again, but not when the lower arm is held accross the belly.</p>

<p>In order to heat up your water, if your container is fireproof (metal, clay) throw it in the flames and away you go.</p>

<p>If you're worried about your container, an efficient way of heating water is to heat up rocks in the fire and then put them in the water.</p>

<p>*One note on heating rocks, if they contain sand or water, they may explode from heating, so be careful with your choices!</p>

I'm sure it goes without saying but when hollowing out wood, using leaves or seaweed to boil water it is essential that the materials used are non-toxic! Do not use leaves/wood in your cooking from plants that you are not 100% positive on the ID</p>

"How high to climb before clipping on a sport climb?","1588","","<p>The guy who taught me to lead sport in the gym suggested that when I'm going for a clip, I position my body so that the clip is somewhere between my hips and my chest. He claimed it was a bad thing when most people reached up high to clip. This question is about whether this advice is right, and if so, why. I've written up what I was able to figure out about this in my own answer, but I'm not sure if my analysis is right, and I'd be interested in other people's answers or criticisms of my own answer.</p>
","<p>Petzl does recommend this for the <strong>second bolt</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Clip the second bolt at waist level; this reduces the amount of rope
  out and thus helps prevent the climber hitting the ground in case of a
  fall  before making the clip.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(<a href=""http://www.petzl.com/files/all/en/activities/sport/tech-tips-sport-climbing_Catalog-2010.pdf"">Section F, second panel</a>.)</p>

<p>I think that's generally good advice for clipping the second bolt (and sometimes for the third bolt if it's far from the second).  For all other bolts, an important thing to remember is that a quality, well-bolted route will have logical stances from which the equipper intended the clip to be made. Bolts are (generally) not uniformly distributed throughout the route, so it's impossible to make blanket statements as to where you should clip from.</p>

<p>Climbing past a perfectly good stance to clip from an awkward stance above doesn't make sense, even though it could potentially minimize a few feet of falling.  Keep in mind the huge mental boost (for most climbers) of being one foot below a bolt instead of several feet above it.</p>

<p>As I've gained more and more experience, I've gotten better and better at judging those ""clipping stances"" from the climb (or even from the ground).  This makes the climbing more efficient.  The only way to get better at this is to get new pitches of climbing under your belt and recognize when you clipped from an awkward stance where a better stance existed nearby.</p>

"Taking care of hiking backpack","1585","","<p>I've had a 60 L backpack for almost seven years now. Nothing on it is broken and it fits my needs, so right now I don't have any thoughts about replacing it (Getting a light pack might be the only reason to do so).</p>

<p>However, I've started to think about what I will do if buckles, straps or zippers break. They've taken quite some abuse in the past; while I will do my best to prevent damage, I can't guarantee much. To prevent an unfortunate situation: What things should I be especially aware of and how - if possible - do I take care of such issues?</p>
","<p>Slightly different take here:  prevention</p>

<p>You should regularly inspect the pack</p>

<ol>
<li>The joining of straps to seams.  Can you see stitching?  Can the strap move independently of the seam (even a little)?  This is easy to reinforce.  I turn it inside out, add a piece of fabric over the inside seam, and stitch just a bit past the original (note this can only really be done once).  Alternatively you could use a seam ripper (if the seams aren't taped) and restitch.</li>
<li>Straps -- If a strap is worn severely, or torn, you can fix by just stitching a reinforcement strap on top.  I use this <a href=""http://www.rei.com/product/813836/rei-34-inch-webbing-straps-with-side-release-buckle"">style of webbing strap</a>. (You can buy strapping material from a fabric store without the buckles.)</li>
<li>Zipper -- Are the teeth worn down?  Are the stitches showing?  If so you may need to replace the zipper, the details of which are a bit beyond this answer.</li>
<li>Zipper (part 2) -- Check the ""stopper"" thing at the bottom.  This stops the zipper from zipping open too far and coming apart.  If it is too worn or loose, simply stitch ten or so loops of thread around it and they will stop the zipper.</li>
<li>Buckles - Your bag probably has plastic buckles.  The buckle will be a whitish color, at a spot where it's been bent too far or too much and is starting to fail.  If you see that then you need to replace the buckle.</li>
<li>Overall -- If you see really worn fabric, a tear, or a hole, even a small one, then you have a major rip waiting to happen.  First carefully stitch a stop circle around the hole or tear.  Then add a patch of the same fabric as the pack.  Do <em>not</em> use iron-on style patches.  They create hard edges which will just make things wear faster and create a larger hole.  Honestly though, if you're at this point, it's going to be time to replace it soon.</li>
</ol>

"What to do when you run out of rope on a sports climb?","1585","","<p>The situation is, that you started a high route with fixed protection (bolts) and misjudged its length, so before reaching the belay the middle mark of the rope passes the belayer.</p>

<p>What can you do to descend safely leaving no or the least amount of gear behind?</p>

<p>You only have a single rope and there is no way to retrieve material from above or another route. I am looking for solutions as simple as possible, as you usually have only quickdraws and maybe a sling and a locker with you on such climbs, but feel free to state good possibilities with some additional gear, just try to minimise - thanks.</p>
","<p>Whether you run out of rope or just can't complete the route, you have to bail as safely as possible.</p>

<p>As soon as your belayer reaches the rope's middle mark, he should double check that there's a stopper knot at the end. Then, you would down climb to the nearest bolt and then proceed to bail on the route using a prusik backup, as described by <a href=""http://4sport.ua/stuff/mn1001/2012-12/13155/files/Solutions-Sport-climbing_Catalog-2011.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this old Petzl article</a>.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gsKwe.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gsKwe.jpg"" alt=""lowering with prusik""></a></p>

<p>Essentially, the prusik short-circuits the top bolt in the event that it fails, lowering the chance of hitting the ground. The only time you'll be on one bolt is right after cleaning the bottom bolt, at which point you should continue down-climbing to safety. In this situation, you would only leave a single carabiner or quick link, and in your scenario, you would use your (nylon) sling and locker for your prusik.</p>

<p>As noted in the comments, leaving a carabiner is preferred to quick links, but use what you have to be safe.</p>

"Is listening to music on earphones while hiking solo safe enough?","1581","","<p>Hiking/ trekking might possibly make you feel anxious especially while hiking solo. </p>

<p>Music can soothe your mind and motivate you a lot. </p>

<p><strong>I would like to know the possible dangers/loss due to listening to music while on trail could lead to. ( I am not talking about playing music loudly. Just plugging in headphones/ earphones and listening.)</strong></p>
","<p>If hiking makes you feel anxious, then don't go hiking.</p>

<p>If you do go hiking, as with most activities, you should pay attention to what your are doing.  That includes listening to what is around you.  Part of the enjoyment for most hikers is experiencing the outdoors.  You can't do that as fully when you disable one of your senses.  Leave the music player and headphones home, and instead listen to the birds, the insects, the water running nearby, the sound of your feet on different surfaces, or that unexpected rustle off to the side.  If these are really not as interesting, fun, soothing, and stimulating to you as music, then I don't understand why you go hiking in the first place.</p>

<p>There is also a safety issue.  To be fair, the things I'm about to describe are unlikely occurances, so most of the time you can be oblivious to them and get away with it.  However, these things do occasionally happen, so having your ears open can be the difference between having a hike and being a statistic.  For example, hearing a hissing sound 10 feet in front of you by the side of the trail can prevent a rattlesnake bite.  Hearing little rattling sounds or even rumbling on the slope above you can alert you to falling rocks.  Unstable snow sometimes makes a sound, which can warn of avalanche risk.  A swooshing sound can help you prepare to not get sand blown in your eyes from a dust devil.  Bears sometimes make huffing sounds as a last warning.  A gurgling sound under the ice signals obvious danger, as does a cracking sound.  Keeping track of the direction of gunshot sounds is a really good idea.  Hearing the whistling of a bullet means you almost got hit, and it's time to do something about it.</p>

<p>If you think that last one is far fetched, it has actually happened to me.  I got down on the ground and yelled as loud as I could.  The yahoos around the hill a bit packed up their rifles and beer coolers and skedaddled out of there.  They may have thought they hit me, and didn't want to be identified.  At least it was a peaceful night after that.</p>

"When I do and when I don't need shoes with ankle supports?","1577","","<p>There has been a lot of lot of discussion about whether the shoes should have ankle support or not.</p>

<p>I have seen the discussions (not just on The Great Outdoors, but elsewhere too) that ankle muscles do not work much and hence leads to weakening of the ankle muscles.
The other perspective to this boils down to the point where we would also need to consider the amount of weight being carried.</p>

<p>And, surprisingly, its not the just the newbies or the rookies debate about, but its a very very common topic for conflicting opinions among the veterans as well.</p>

<p>What all factor should one consider while deciding upon preferring shoes with ankle support and without them?</p>
","<p>The question has the tag ""mountaineering,"" but most of the time when I hear people say that you need boots with ankle support, they're actually talking about trail-walking. The cases of hiking and mountaineering are qualitatively different.</p>

<p>For mountaineering, one big reason people usually don't use lightweight running shoes is that often there is talus, scree, and loose rock. Small scree is a nuisance if it gets inside your shoes, although there are lightweight gaiters with velcro attachments (e.g., Dirty Girl) that do a great job of keeping that out. The bigger issue is that on a steep scree or talus slope (the kind of thing you have to scramble up, not a trail), there is often unstable rock, and it can be nice to have your feet protected against getting banged or crushed. When coming <em>down</em> a scree slope, boots allow you to do a scree glassade, which is much faster and infinitely more fun than the alternative.</p>

<p>For trail walking, the idea of wearing heavy boots for ankle support is at best a matter of personal preference, and at worst a harmful superstition. Plenty of people carry heavy packs over uneven ground while wearing running shoes. An influential advocate of lightweight shoes for this purpose was Ray Jardine, who wrote the 1992 book <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0963235931"">Beyond Backpacking</a>. IIRC Jardine describes in the book how he goes on long-distance backpacking trips with his girlfriend (doing something like 25 miles a day), and he uses running shoes while she uses boots; he portrays it as a matter of personal preference. The problem with boots is that they're heavy, and weight on your feet hurts your efficiency many times more than an equivalent weight carried on your back. Also, the heavier your footwear, the harder it is to get a comfortable fit and the more likely you are to get blisters.</p>

<p>Running shoes do become impractical in very specific situations. They aren't good in snow, for slogging through deep mud, for technical rock climbing, or for very cold conditions. Sometimes if you have a day of hiking with 20 or 30 little stream crossings, it can be a real nuisance to use running shoes; if you're wearing water-resistant boots, you can walk straight through a shallow stream.</p>

<p>Running shoes don't work well if there's a lot of snow (although it can be done -- a lot of PCTers get through the Sierra in early season using running shoes). And running shoes are obviously not compatible with crampons, although it is possible to throw a pair of microspikes in your pack if you think you might just encounter a few isolated icy patches on a steep trail.</p>

<p>For people who are afraid they'll turn an ankle if they try to use running shoes with a heavy pack on uneven ground, there are still alternatives to boots. One is simply to keep doing the activity in running shoes, which will strengthen your ankles until you feel more physically confident. Another is to adopt a lightweight or ultralight style of backpacking, so that you're not tottering down the trail with the Leaning Tower of Pisa on your back. Jardine's book was an early influence in establishing the concept of ultralight backpacking, but today a better source of information is probably the web site <a href=""http://www.backpackinglight.com"">backpackinglight</a>.</p>

<p>Four mountaineering, many people carry a separate pair of lightweight approach shoes that are more comfortable than mountaineering boots. They hike in to the climb in the approach shoes, then switch to the boots when the real mountaineering starts. There are specialized shoes sold for this, such as the Evolv Cruzer, that flatten down really small in your pack when you're not using them.</p>

<p>How can I pack this stuff without that happening?</p>
","<p>I pack it like you do, and rarely ever have trouble. I think the important steps are what you do when you go to use it and what you use it for. </p>

<p>First when I go to use it I remove the cross wrap completely. </p>

<p>I hold it by the loop at the top or bottom. Once the cross wrap is undone I pull the mid section apart and lay it on the ground so it is in a complete circle. </p>

<p>I don't touch the other end as much as possible. This is pretty easy when climbing but much harder during other activities. If I know I need some of the other end but will not need to touch it after that (like tying to an anchor or plugging in an extension cord) then I pull the amount I need out that side of the rope and then lay the circle of rope on the ground that side down. I will try to find a video or pics of this.</p>

<p>Also, when coiling the rope up, if it's more than 100ft I use the ""Backpackers"" Coil (also know as a ""butterfly"" coil). I did a short Google search and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4uwdLAKT1g"" rel=""nofollow"">this video</a> came up that explained it exactly how I do it. </p>

<p>If you are coiling anything by hand, and not using the behind the neck method, twist the rope as you coil it, it will coil and un-coil much easier. A simple half twist is usually all it needs which once you get in the habit you will find yourself doing with out realizing it as you coil anything. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHIeQxyUmX0"" rel=""nofollow"">This Video</a> does a good job of showing what I am talking about from seconds 22 to 32.

<li>Make sure your fuel container is not in direct contact with the ground.  It'll suck the heat right out of your fuel, reducing vapors.</li>
<li>Warm your fuel first (armpits work, closed container obviously)</li>
</ol>

<p>If you are using actual alcohol, you're going to have trouble below freezing.  As Olin mentioned, the vapors are what burn, and alcohol just doesn't produce enough when it's below freezing.  Also, while alcohol has good energy/volume ratios it doesn't burn as hot or fast so even once lit, it's harder to get water to boil.  However you can try the following to help.</p>

<ol>
<li>Use a primer pan.  The youtube video <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4PjL6MAgTI"" rel=""nofollow"">Alcohol Stove- Primer Plate vs. No Primer</a> gives a good example of how effective those can be.

<li>Use a wick, usually fiberglass.  Exact placement depends on your stove, but this can help by increasing surface area.</li>

One climbed Kilimanjaro, we both hiked in Polish Tatras in the winter, but we don't have any experience in climbing glaciers, protecting ourselves with ropes etc. We know how to do it, we just didn't have a chance to practice in a mountain setting. It would be more challenging and satisfying to climb Kazbek by ourselves, but we don't want to take unnecessary risks. Please help us deciding. (guide recommendations are welcome as well)</p>
","<p>Being young, athletic, fit and having great conditions won't help you if you are missing experience in techniques/tactics required when going over glaciers.

"How to attach snowboard to backpack during skitour?","1556","","<p>I'm a snowboarder.</p>

<p>In preparation for a skitour trip, I was on the lookout for splitboards. But it turns out that even renting them can be a bit of a hassle and/or is quite expensive.
As availability for a splitboard is questionable, I'd like to take my regular board with me on a backpack and do the ascent with snow shoes.</p>

<p>Simply attaching the board to the back of the backpack does not look like the best option. I heard from people that this causes the board to swing around and to be a pain for the shoulders.</p>

<p>Some people seem to have the boards horizontal, which allows them to have them closer to their back (good), but if walking through a forest or narrow passage this can be a problem. I don't know if that would be possible with my standard hiking backpack.</p>

<p><strong>What's the best way to attach a snowboard during a skitour?</strong></p>

<p>The board should not move around, it should not be (too) painful and it should still allow me to move around.</p>
","<p>There are three important aspects: Maneuverability, exposure to wind and firm attachment.</p>

<p>The optimal orientation for all of those is vertical. Most of the board is then covered by the body so there is minimal added wind resistance compared with horizontal mounting, were most of the board sticks out on the side and act as a huge sail. With horizontal mounting you have a much higher moment of inertia. So turning is awkward and you will much easier catch branches and the like (even though that can happen with vertical mounting too above the head, but much less). Firm attachment is also better, as you can fixate it farther apart, as backpacks are usually longer in height than they are in width.</p>

<p>So ideally you have a backpack designed to do tours with a snowboard. They have dedicated attachment straps on the back and are opened by zips along the backpack brim or even on back. This allows you to reach your stuff even with mounted board, which is very awkward with they usual closing with a top pocket and a strap on the outside towards the bottom. If you do not have such a dedicated backpack you need some kind of attachment points on the top and bottom of the pack. Many backpacks have straps on the side on the top and the bottom to mount skis or to compress them. You can use two additional straps (not part of the backpack itself) that you feed through those straps on the side so that they run twice from side to side over the backpack. Then you insert your board such that the lower binding is just above the lower strap, which keeps it from sliding down. Then you also attach the upper strap and tighten both. If your backpack is not filled up quite will, you will also have to tighten the straps on the side to make it stable. This is my usual setup as skier when I carry a board of a participant and it gives a very secure fix, but the problem with opening the backpack remains. So this is fine for occasional use, but if you like doing snowboard tours it is well worth to invest in a dedicated backpack.</p>

<p>My key concern is pain reduction, since (barring and allergic reaction) I am not returning to town for a sting.  I've tried cortisone cream and it's placebo level pain reduction at best.</p>
","<p>There are several things that supposedly reduce the pain - if you have any baking soda with you (sounds silly but if you frequently get stung it may be a good idea for this reason) then mixing some in with water and applying it can reduce the sting. Note that a common misconception is that all wasp stings are alkali, and therefore vinegar should be applied - <em>a yellow jacket's sting isn't however, it's acidic!</em></p>

<p>Antihistamines can also help with the swelling, so (barring other health complications) taking some of them should help things.</p>

<p>How do I properly inspect the rope when I'm about to start a climb?</p>
","<p>I would inspect your rope long before you get to the crag, rather than just before you're about to use/need it.</p>

<p>Rope inspection is essentially going over the whole length of the rope, looking for grit or evidence of wear in the outer layer. One thing to note, the inside of the rope might have been strained and this isn't easily visible from the outside - sometimes you can feel the outer layer sliding over these areas.</p>

<p>Rope has a shelf-life - but this also depends on how often you use it. Another rule of thumb to follow is that if you have taking one major outdoor lead fall on the rope (from above protection), then you retire it. You can take several minor falls before retiring it. Top-rope falls should almost have negligible effect - unless there was a lot of slack in the system for some reason and the climber fell more than a couple of metres or so.</p>

<p>If, at any time, you are not confident in your rope - replace it. The price is worth a lot less than a climbing injury.</p>

"Why are backpacks mostly not made of waterproof material?","1544","","<p>Many bicycle panniers are made of waterproof material.  Backpacks are not, necessitating built-in or separate raincovers.  Why don't backpacks use the material that waterproof panniers do?  Unlike gear to be worn on the body, there's no need for backpacks to breathe.</p>
","<p>There are quite a few backpacks made of waterproof materials, especially among cottage manufacturers. ZPacks, Hyperlight Mountain Gear, Zimmerbuilt, Gossamer Gear, and many others manufacture packs out of Hybrid Cuben Fiber, Dimension Polyant X-Pac fabrics, or other waterproof materials. Even more mainstream manufacturers use a good deal of waterproof fabrics. Speaking anecdotally, my REI Flash 45 uses waterproof fabric for most of the pack body.</p>

<p>However, there is more to waterproofing a pack than the fabrics. Even packs that use waterproof textiles are not sufficiently waterproof unless the seams are sealed. Moreover, water can enter through zippers or drawcord openings. There are some packs on the market designed not to need a liner or cover (the ZPacks Arc Blast, for example), but achieving this requires a number of design considerations. They must simplify construction to minimize the number and complexity of seams to seal, they must eliminate features that create entry points for water (like hydration hose ports and zippers), and they must use a rolltop closure to seal out water.</p>

<p>On a simple ultralight pack, this isn't much of a compromise. But as complexity increases, rainproofing becomes more and more difficult to achieve, to the point where it is simply easier (and lighter) to add a pack liner or cover.</p>

  <p>Where does the route setter know from which movements capabilities and

<p>He doesn't. <code>Skills != grade</code>. Grade is a measure of difficulty. </p>

<p>You may find you prefer a particular type of climbing (say slabs or ones involving dynamic moves, etc). you have good skills in this area. This can make climbs of that style easier for you. But grades should ignore this fact. That's why it's better to get a range of opinions when grading.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are there some general catalogues / guidelines which movements or
  skills are necessary to master a certain grade?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, grading is a subjective process. It's more art than science. There is no rules that say all v3s must be overhanging and use x size holds. It's purely down to how the route is set. Routes have different characteristics, these can make a climb more difficult or easier, but the route and characteristics of a climb are secondary to the grade. The grade purely exists to add a figure to the difficulty of the climb. i.e. a severely overhanging climb can be easy if it uses large well spaced holds or very difficult if it uses smaller difficult to reach holds. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Moreover, there are route setter certifications for local, national
  and international level and a proper organization</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Route setting and grading is different. You may set a route at 5.2 but following feedback you may change it's grade. It's common in indoor gyms to have a route feedback form. Outdoors route grades can and do change.</p>

<p>Also bear in mind a grade is typically <strong>a grade of the hardest one(or more) moves on a single climb</strong>. If 90% of the moves on a climb are 5+ but one move is 6a, the climb is graded 6a as that is the hardest part.</p>

<p><em>I'm going to reiterate some of the answer from <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/a/6189/2766"">Rating unorthodox climbs</a>. This is a different question but the answer is pretty much identical.</em></p>

  <blockquote>

  <p>There are a number of different challenges to grading climbs:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Climbing grades are a <strong>rule of thumb</strong> and are open to interpretation.</li>
  <li>They are a measure of how hard it is to climb. Different people find    different aspects of climbing more or less difficult so it is
  always    open to interpretation.</li>
  <li>Indoor grades are often very different to outdoor grades, bouldering    gardes are very different to Trad grades, etc, etc.</li>
  <li>Grades tend to overlap so there is very little difference between a <code>5.9</code> and a <code>5.10a</code></li>
  <li>Height of climb, length of pitches, rock type, all need to be included in the grade. This makes comparing grades in different areas
  difficult.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>This is to the point that when a new climb is ""put up"" the grade that
  the first climber gives it is a provisional one. This grade needs to
  be confirmed by one or more climbers before it is accepted.</p>
  
  <hr>
  
  <p>The best way to grade a climb is to gain experience of climbing well
  know climbs that the grade is well known and accepted. Then when you
  want to grade something that you don't know the grade for you need to
  ask yourself (and others preferably) is this harder or easier than x
  and y climbs? How much harder or easier? What about w climb? etc. </p>
  
  <p>You'll likely never get it 100% right, people argue over grades
  constantly. But the whole point is that it's impossible to get 100%
  right. It's a guide only. You may find a V1 that's easy or a
  completely different V1 that you find difficult.</p>

"What is the longest time you can go, eating only freeze-dried food?","1543","","<p>As a former member of the Swedish home guard youth, I was told during a survival exercise that you could eat only freeze-dried food for about two weeks. Young and green as I was, I swallowed the statement without any further thought. </p>

<p>I have come to discover that this statement was not all truth. The recommendation is given by the Swedish military to make sure that soldiers don't go too long without varying their meals. Since the MREs (meals ready to eat) you are getting at the army is somewhat limited in variation, they also recommend that you try to eat plenty of fibre alongside your allotted food rations.</p>

<p>Deciding to test this out by myself I bought the approved MRE (aka. Grönpåsen) for full two weeks. After about a week of nothing but freeze-dried, I felt pretty normal in forms of physical strength and nothing stood out. Aside from the fact that I went to the bathroom about three times in that week, it didn't feel like anything was wrong.</p>

<p>After the full two weeks, I felt that nothing had changed, except the regularity of my bathroom visits (and the fact that I was getting pretty bored with the food). I should probably have ate something rich in fibre on the side to alleviate the lack of it in my diet. This I discovered when I returned to eating normal food, let's just say that I was struck by ""Montezuma's revenge"" a couple of hours after my first ""normal"" meal.</p>

<p>So my question is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>What is the maximum time one could live on freeze-dried food and keep a
healthy level of nutrients and minerals?
Also, how would this diet affect the digestion?
</code></pre>
","<p>As far as I know you should be able to survive for quite a long time.
I often hear about ocean racers who have just freeze-dried foods to eat and they live on that for more then 2-3 months at a time.</p>

<p>There are no side effects. They are in fact very healthy, so I see no issues, apart from a very dull taste, that you can't live on this indefinitely As far as side effects I don't know.</p>

<p>Here is a <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/sailing/3683649/Brian-Thompsons-on-board-meal-plans-during-the-Vendee-Globe-World-Race.html"">reference</a> with some information.

"What is the first thing to do, when buried in an avalanche?","1542","","<p>Are there set rules I should follow which would increase my chances of survival if I get buried by an avalanche?</p>

<p>Should I try to do anything if I get caught-up in one, before it has settled?</p>
","<p>The correct answer is to put your <a href=""http://blackdiamondequipment.com/en/avalung-ii-sling-BD1500110000M_L1.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">avalung</a> mouthpiece in your mouth and inflate your <a href=""http://www.mec.ca/product/5033-753/mammut-pro-protection-35-pas-airbag-unisex/?h=10%2050006%2050010&amp;f=10%2050006%2050132"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">airbag</a>. If you don't have either of those things, then you are <strong><em>NOT</em></strong> properly equipped to be in avalanche terrain. </p>

<p>If you get caught in an avalanche <em>when you are not properly equipped</em>, then the best you can do is 'swim' like crazy to try and keep yourself afloat, and then bury your face into your arms as though you are sneezing and inflate your lungs as much as you can before you come to a stop. This will hopefully prevent suffocation from the snow pack squeezing the air out of you, as well as provide you with a small pocket of air in front of your face and give you a couple more minutes of breathing. It will also give you the use of your arms when you stop. You will not necessarily be able to create an air pocket afterwards, when an avalanche settles it can be as hard as concrete. Be sure to keep your mouth closed while you're in an avalanche as well, people have been extracted from avalanches with snow packed all the way down their throats to their stomaches, and up into their sinuses. </p>

<p>If you are skiing, you want to drop your poles and try to get your skis off if you can, they will only act as anchors and drag you down leaving you buried deeper. </p>

<p>If you want to experience getting caught in a tiny avalanche via GoPro, <a href=""http://youtu.be/Tbuk9AyEap8?t=1m"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">watch this video.</a> This guy only got buried less than a metre deep in a small, slow avalanche of light fluffy snow, but he's still pretty helpless. This situation would afford you more time because the snow isn't packed, which gives you more breathing time because there is more air in the snow. You'll notice he is also able to create a pocket of air around his face, which isn't always possible. This doesn't give you more air to breathe, it merely displaces the existing air in the snow and helps dissipate the CO2 that you are exhaling <em>(this is what the Avalung does, it vents your exhaled air behind you to prevent CO2 buildup around your face-which can give you over a half hour of additional breathing time)</em>. This guy probably could have dug himself out at this depth, but he didn't pop out of his skis, which I bet are anchoring him down in the snow. He also knows that his friends saw him get buried and aren't far away, so he's playing it smart and conserving oxygen by not struggling. It's important to stay calm and breath slow when you're buried in an avalanche, panicking will only kill you faster. </p>

<p>When you train for avalanche rescue you're taught that you have about 15 minutes from time of burial before the victim runs out of oxygen. So no matter what you do, in an avalanche, your life still depends on your friends finding you, so you'd better have your <a href=""http://www.mec.ca/product/5014-268/backcountry-access-tracker-2-transceiver/?f=10&amp;q=avalanche%2Bbeacon"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">beacon</a> on, with new batteries in it, and the people you're with had better know how to preform a rescue. <strong><em>NEVER</em> go into avalanche terrain with out having proper avalanche training.</strong> </p>

<p>I would think that the weather would have a great deal to do with when this happens, what are good indicators or conditions that would create situations like this?</p>
","<p>That phenonmon is called a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_(meteorology)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cloud inversion</a>. It happens in mountainous areas when a layer of warm moist air passes over cold valley floor. So initially the valley is full of cold air:</p>

<pre><code>\            /
 \   cold   /
  \        /
   \______/
</code></pre>

<p>In certain circumstances (an approaching warm front) a layer of warm moist air will pass into the valley and will be forced above the cold air (warm air rises and is less dense, etc)</p>

<pre><code>\    warm    /
 \ -------  /
  \  cold  /
   \______/
</code></pre>

<p>The valley sides and the warm air trap the cold in the valley bottom. Where the warm and cold air touch water is condensed from the warm air to form clouds (<code>---</code>). The warm air acts as a ""cap"" preventing the cold from escaping (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capping_inversion"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Capping inversion</a>)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Your looking for a warm front meeting a cold air mass (high pressure in winter) in a mountainous area. Strong winds will ""mix"" the air masses, so ideally it should be calm. </p>

<p>This typically happen around dawn and tend to burn off as the valley bottom is heated, though they can last for long periods of time if the conditions are right. The larger the tempaterature difference (between the cold and the warm masses) the better chance of this happening so look for a warm front where the temperature infront of it, is a lot colder than that behind it (all warm fronts have this to a degree)</p>

<p>We won't be near lights, established ""bathrooms"", etc.  The adults will be asleep as well, and I'm hoping for a solution that does not involve sleeping in shifts.  </p>
","<p>The other two answers mention 'summer camp' type environments. My answer is more focused at family camping, but has some relevance to both:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>With younger children it can be very simple, although possibly not the most comfortable:
You sleep across the doorway. For any child to get out at night they need to climb over you. If you think they could sneak around you (if you have a tent with a wide door, for example), you could look at putting a string through the zipper with a loose bow, but I'd tend to advise against this as in an emergency it could cause confusion. </p></li>
<li><p>With older children (I'm thinking 7 to 10 year olds) you can run a brightly coloured cord from the tent to the latrine area, and depending on the environment, you could leave a couple of night lanterns at the tents (this has its drawbacks in attracting insects)</p></li>
<li><p>Above that age, as long as they are sensible, just make sure they have some obvious signposting - natural features etc - which they can use to navigate back. As long as you aren't in dangerous country (bears, cliffs, etc.) older kids want to go exploring at night.</p></li>

"What to bring into a tree stand?","1537","","<p>What should you be putting into your pack when you head up to a tree stand, beyond your gun or bow and ammo, to hunt whitetail deer?</p>
","<p>You're making a big safety mistake by putting your gun in your pack when you climb into a tree stand.</p>

<p>In reality, it is safer to haul up all of your gear, including your pack, and your gun <strong>unloaded with the action open</strong> by a rope, rather than have it on your back where it could a) go off or b) hurt you when you fall.  You could also damage the gun.</p>

<p>As for other things to bring, the list is subjective:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hot thermos of coffee/other hot drink - you're gonna be sitting in one position for a while - as well as food with lots of carbohydrates and calories in it.</li>
<li>Binoculars to scan the ground below and the surrounding territory.</li>

<li>Plenty of warm gear, including hat(s), gloves, a number of layers, and warm boots, etc.</li>
<li><em>The rest is up to you.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>You can bring more items, and leave them at the bottom of the tree stand, say in your pack, and use the rope to bring up <em>just what you need</em>.  You can always go back down to get something - as it can get awkward sometimes having a lot of equipment in the stand with you.</p>

"What can be safely trimmed on a backpack","1534","","<p>When trimming weight there are a lot of options.  Lighter gear, less gear, etc.  One of those options is to take an existing pack and trim off ""unnecessary"" extras.  For instance, I have (no kidding) 2ft. of extra strap on both of sides of my waist belt.</p>

<p>When trimming a pack, what are the places, parts, areas that can be trimmed to reduce weight and what should you generally avoid trimming?</p>

<p>Edit:  This is about trimming the actual backpack itself, not the gear inside.</p>
","<p>First, consider if you have the right backpack. If you're considering chopping off all sorts of parts, you might be using a pack that isn't designed for you. You could sell it off and buy a more minimalist pack, such as one from <a href=""http://www.golite.com"">GoLite</a> (I say GoLite because I'm unfamiliar with other lightweight packs).</p>

<p>With that out of the way, consider what you want to use or carry. If there is no possible reason you would want to strap things to the outside of your pack, feel free to cut off those outside straps completely (the ones on the back that don't compress your pack at all). Most people like something there to attach things to when necessary, however, such as wet clothing, boots, wag bags, etc. There are sometimes one or two little loops of strap on the bottom of the back of your pack. Those are specifically there for mountaineering or ice axes. If you aren't going to be using those, cut them off (though they are good attachment points for other items, if you need it).</p>

<p>If your pack won't be too overloaded, you can probably cut off the strap that goes across the top of your pack (the one underneath the lid, or ""brain""). If you roll up the opening enough, there isn't much need for it - though I use mine to hold a rope or other large squishy items.</p>

<p>There are sometimes extra buckles, clips, and straps floating around on your pack. Find what they do, and answer in your head whether they are crucial to the load bearing of your pack or not. If they aren't, then they are convenience items and can be removed at your discretion (melt the ends of the nylon to make them pretty once you cut). If they are compression straps (usually these are on the side of the pack, and are pretty important to the comfort of the pack), don't cut them. You'll be much happier with them still around, despite the ounce of weight. The same goes for straps that hold the pack on you. Shoulder and waist belt straps can be shortened somewhat (carefully!), but don't make them so tiny that you can't make adjustments or put the pack on someone else. If you cut those types of straps, make sure you clean up the cut ends so that they won't slip through whatever buckle system they are installed in.</p>

<p>Finally, be very cautious about trimming any non-strap item. Packs are notoriously difficult to repair if you cut up the wrong thing. Occasionally there are places you can cut off non-strap items, such as attached pockets or cute frills, but know that they might be hiding an important seam, or might be providing much needed waterproofness (as an aside, remember that there really aren't any ""waterproof"" packs. The material may be waterproof, but the seams aren't, and seam sealing an entire pack is very challenging). </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Rolling/folding</strong> is a lot easier to manage in my opinion, easier to keep track of all the pieces, and when camping in dirty/snowy/wet environments makes it easier to keep the ground side of the tent together and the clean(ish) parts away from it. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stuffing</strong> results in fewer creases in the fabric over extended periods of use, because you stuff it differently each time.

<p>As an additional, <strong>what is a required battery life for a diving torch?</strong> Some only last 30 minutes which, to me, seems too low.</p>
","<p>This is not an easy question to answer. More lumens means better light, normally also further range. But if you dive in areas with lots of suspended particles in the water you will get a lot of back scatter which in effect impacts on visibility.</p>

<p>Then the next question is do you need it for night dives or just to help see more colours on deeper dives where your colours have become dull and especially red has disappeared?</p>

<p>The best option for a dive light is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Batteries lasts at least 25% - 50% longer than your average dive time</li>
<li>It uses standard batteries (AA, C or D) and rechargeable versions of standard batteries</li>
<li>It uses LED lights (less power usage for more lumen and light tends to be white rather than yellow)</li>
<li>Adjustable Strength - some dive lights have 2 or 3 settings so you can increase/decrease power as you need it</li>
<li>Narrow beam, better to focus on what you are looking at</li>

"What is a good tool for minor trail maintenance while hiking?","1519","","<p>I hike a few trails in the lower Appalachians which are very infrequently traveled.  Maintenance when it happens, is performed by hikers.  I much prefer to just clear smaller blowdowns as I come to them than to make an entire separate trip.</p>

<p>What is the best carry tool for minor trail maintenance on a hike?  Axe, machete, folding saw...etc.</p>

<p>(By minor, I mean small, less than 4"" diameter branches, not log clearing)</p>
","<p>I do deliberate trail maintenence regularly, and unfortunately what you can do is severly limited if you want to do it casually while only carrying something small.</p>

<p>There is no set of tools you can reasonably carry, even if you go out only for that purpose, that will cover more than maybe 3/4 of the problems you find.  My preferred weapons for deliberate trail maintenence are work gloves with leather palm and palm-side of the fingers, a bow saw, and a small pair of clippers.  The clippers are the kind you can work with one hand.  This is a tradeoff, but gives you good coverage for most problems up to where a chainsaw would be needed.</p>

<p>The problem with bringing more than one tool is that you constantly have to keep switching the tool you are using, and therefore have to put the other tool where you can find it again and won't forget it.  The bow saw is relatively light and easily carried in one hand.  I don't want something in the other hand, else I'd always have to put it down when using the bow saw.  That's why I bring a small pair of clippers so I can keep them in a back pocket.</p>

<p>A bow saw is probably the single best tool.  You may be surprised what you can cut with it.  White pines (<i>Pinus strobus</i>, the easiest trees to cut here in New England) up to 6 inches can be handled.  Oaks and harder wood up to 4 inches without too much trouble, and 6 inches if you're willing to spend some time and put some effort into it.  That means multiple cuts to make a notch, probably from both sides.  With a pine, in contrast, you make a small cut on one side, 1/3 of the way thru from the other, and then just push it over.  Downed limbs is more work but the same sizes can eventually be handled.</p>

<p>Other useful tools are a long pair of loppers, the kind it takes both hands to operate.  However, if you've got one of those, you really can't do much else.  This only makes sense therefore if you're in a group.  Me with bow saw and small clippers, one person with large clippers, and one with a chain saw is a pretty good team.  You can get more fancy, in some cases by adding someone with a rake or something that can rearrange dirt in the right conditions, but in the general case I'd rather have a fourth person have just ""bare hands"" (with good work gloves on, or course).  A good part of the time you're just breaking things off with your hands, moving logs out of the way, or are dragging something off the trail that was just cut.</p>

<p>For me at least, I rather either go out to work on the trail or to hike.  Each would significantly impact the other, so it's more trouble than it's worth in my opinion.  I also regularly do trail work, so I don't feel bad at all about just going out and hiking and leaving the maintenence to someone else occasionally.</p>

<p>If you really want to do some maintenence while hiking without carrying much or taking much time, you're going to have to realize up front you're only going to fix a small part of the problems you encounter.  I can see three levels of ""casual"" trail maintenence while the main point of the outing was just hiking.  In order of seriousness:<ol></p>

<p><li>Bare hands.  Wear a good pair of work gloves and do what you can.  This has the advantage that you don't have to carry extra tools, you're always ""ready"", and you do a lot without even stopping.  If you've never done trail work, you'll probably be surprised how much you can actually accomplish with ""bare hands"", suitably gloved so you don't think twice about grabbing a rough piece of wood hard and yanking and throwing it.  A whole bunch of maintenence is simply clearing relatively small stuff that has broken off trees and fallen onto the trail.  Remember that when dragging larger branches, drag them trunk-end first else they get hung up on everything.  Think of them sortof as one-way ratchets.</p>

<p><li>Add small clippers to the work gloves.  You'll probably keep the clippers in the pocket and do bare hands things most of the time, but sometimes clippers are just what you need to deal with encroaching branches.  Two rules to remember:</p>

<p><i><b>If in doubt, cut it out!</b></i></p>

<p>Inexperienced trail maintainers tend to cut branches right at the edge of the trail.  Think about it.  Trees grow, which is why the branch is now over the trail in the first place.  Are you going to come every week and trim the branches back?  I didn't think so.  Think a few years out.  If the branches from a 30 foot tree 3 feet from the trail are getting in the way now, think what will happen as soon as you leave after trimming them.  If the tree is only 3 feet from the trail, cut the whole branch right at the trunk and you won't have that problem again.  If it's a 10 foot tree, lose the whole tree.  Problem permanently solved.  Don't be timid.  The trail is a small path thru big woods.  Cutting branches back to 10 feet instead of the 5 foot trail width isn't going to hurt the forest, but it will keep the trail clear another two years longer, at least from <i>that</i> tree.</p>

<p><i><b>Never put a small hand tool on the ground</b></i></p>

<p>You may be tempted to put a tool down ""just for a minute"" while you use a different tool or drag off a branch or something.  Don't.  Put it in your pocket.  Sooner or later you're going to forget to pick it up.  When you come back to look for it, you'll suddenly realize how small the tool and how big the woods are.  Unless you remember exactly where you put it (and you won't), it's gone.</p>

<p>I've even ""lost"" my bow saw for a while a few times, and that's much bigger than a small pair of clippers.  I can't put the bow saw in my pocket, but I do have to get it out of my hands regularly.  I make a special discipline out of deliberately putting it in the middle of the trail a bit further <i>in the direction I will be going</i>.  That way, it's easier to find because the trail is presumably more clear, and if I forget I'll more likely notice it when continuing on.</p>

<p><li>The last level of causal trail work while otherwise hiking is one of those folding saws.  They are actually pretty crappy saws and nowhere near as effective as a bow saw, but they do work and will be the only way to cut something too big or tough for small clippers.  That would be a white pine maybe 3/4 inch in diamter or something harder 1/2 inch.</p>

<p></ol></p>

<p>Anything more effective than these three levels requires a more serious commitment to maintenence such that I wouldn't call it hiking anymore.</p>

"Starting cross-country skiing off trails","1514","","<p>I've done a bit of cross-country skiing on trails at local mountains, but I'm more interested in getting off the trails and out into the woods.  The terrain around here is pretty steep in general with very heavy powder when it snows, which it does a lot (the closest alpine area currently has ~11 feet of snow on the ground and this is normal).  Generally, it doesn't get too icy, and rarely below say 15F in temperature.</p>

<p>I'm a bigger guy, so I've found that snowshoeing is pretty painful once the powder gets deep and I lose the ability to ""float"" pretty quick even on bigger snowshoes.  </p>

<p>I have very little interest in climbing things for the purpose of downhill skiing (I'm a snowboarder anyways), mainly I want to move efficiently through deep snow with a pack on, camp, or climb mountains.</p>

<p>I would prefer a solution that is lighter (i.e. if I can strap 2 lbs to each foot and have a somewhat compromised setup, I would prefer that to a ""perfect"" 5 lb setup).</p>
","<p>I don't have the time to give a truly complete answer here, but a good choice for you might be metal edged, waxless, backcountry cross-country skis.</p>

<p>Other options might include:
Snowshoes (which you don't like)
Telemark or Alpine Touring skis (which are heavy, and downhill focused)
Postholing (no fun)</p>

<p>XC skis are far lighter than a telemark setup (~1.6kg, 3.6lbs per pair). They are also much easier to learn. The ones with metal edges will allow you to descend with some basic turns (unlike most XC skis, which don't have metal edges). Added to that, using ones that use a ""fishscale"" instead of waxing will make your life much easier.</p>

<p>Atomic makes several, though someone (maybe me, later) would need to go over the options for you. Something like <a href=""http://www.atomic.com/en-CA/Products/Nordic/Ski/Leisure/MOUNTAIN_BC_GRIP/AB0009800.aspx?filter=235:1"">Mountain BC Grip</a> would probably work.
Madshus makes several as well, such as the <a href=""http://madshus.com/skis/glittertind"">Glittertind</a>. Don't forget a set of bindings, which are relatively cheap.</p>

<p>You will also need sturdy boots (backcountry XC boots are different than classic and sport boots, particularly if you're talking racing boots), and poles.</p>

<p>When I worked at an outdoor shop a few years ago we would sell a package deal for a very basic backcountry XC setup (skis, bindings, boots, poles) for around $250. Those were only so-so, but they get better from there.</p>

<p>There are a couple disadvantages.</p>

<ul>
<li>Not as much surface area as a larger ski (or some snowshoes)</li>
<li>Harder to get up very steep hills (as compared to teles with skins, or snowshoes, though there are some skins designed for them - they are rare)</li>
<li>Not as durable as teles or snowshoes</li>
</ul>

<p>Really a lot of this depends on the terrain and your desires.</p>

"What are some ways/devices that I can use to charge my batteries in the wilderness?","1507","","<p>When backpacking, I might carry a MagLite flashlight or something similar that requires two AA batteries.  I tend to favor rechargeable batteries for a variety of reasons.  </p>

<p><em>How can I recharge my batteries in the wilderness?</em></p>
","<p>Perhaps the most obvious and commercially available is <strong>solar</strong>, which has options ranging from small pocket-sized chargers to roll-out military grade flexible panels. I believe Brunton makes a consumer grade version of the latter (not as bullet-proof), and iGo has some nice versions of the former. </p>

<p>I have used both with some success, the panel is probably over-kill if you are just looking to charge a few AAs (we were charging GPS dataloggers and hand-held computers). However, the small ones are not something I would depend upon, tending to charge slowly. Both require (of course) sunlight.</p>

<p>The second option is to carry more batteries -- either another set or two of fully charged batteries in the size you need, or if you have a variety of other electronics to charge, an old-school camcorder battery can be used to re-charge smaller batteries. Some companies make recharge-able power-packs geared toward cell-phones which function the same way.</p>

<p><strong>However,</strong> for anything critical (emergency devices) I would highly recommend ALWAYS packing a set of fresh, regular batteries that you can slip in when your re-charge options fail.</p>

<p><em>Digression 1:</em> I've often thought a little hydro-generator would be slick if you are camping near a creek - plop it in the current and charge overnight... but have yet to find one (or hear of a do-it-yourself) that is practical.</p>

<p><em>Digression 2:</em> While poking around for the hydro-power, I found <a href=""http://www.instructables.com/id/Camping-Wind-Turbine/"">this wind turbine</a> which looks like a fun project... and possible could (should) be modified for water-born deployment. Water always flows.</p>

<p><em>BONUS PRO-TIP</em>: On cold mornings, gently warming a dying battery (ie in your arm-pit, or in a hot cup of coffee) can sometimes get the reaction going just enough to generate a last gasp of energy. <em>Highly NOT recommended</em> as standard practice due to explosion concerns, but in a life-or-death emergency, it might give you enough juice to make that critical radio call.</p>

"Is a single strand of webbing unacceptable for climbing anchors?","1502","","<p>While browsing the DumbAnchors blog, <a href=""http://dumbanchors.blogspot.com/2016/02/must-be-spring.html"" rel=""nofollow"">I came across a post</a> which points out the poor use of a single strand (not a loop) of webbing for building top rope anchors.</p>

<p>The blogger doesn't say why these are unacceptable to use, he only points out the mistakes people make.</p>

<p>Assuming the other components of the anchor are correct, <strong>is/why is a single strand of webbing unacceptable to use for a climbing anchor?</strong></p>

<p>Edit: To clarify, assume the webbing is redundant above the master point, just not used in a loop above the master point. For example, it may have a figure eight clipped to a bolt with one single strand coming down to the master point. Also, <a href=""http://dumbanchors.blogspot.com/2014/10/two-anchors-today-both-stupid.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here's another post with some commentary</a>.</p>
","<p>As with most things in climbing, I myself would not go as far as saying this is generally unacceptable. In multipoint anchors there are often single strand connections between one point and the central point when building a <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/6854/when-to-set-up-a-cordelette-and-an-equalette"">cordelette or equalette</a>. So the question reduces to whether it is (un-)acceptable when using a single point (like a tree) as an anchor.</p>

<p>Typical climbing webbing has a strength of 10kN or more and a general rule of thumb is that knots reduce the strength by 50%. This is an extremely conservative estimate derived from sewn slings, which have a strength of 22kN as a loop, neglecting the sewing, dividing by two and rounding down this results in this very conservative estimate. So using a single strand you obviously need a knot, resulting in a minimal strength of 5kN. While this is enough for top-roping with belaying correctly, it does not have much safety margin. The fact that there is only one anchor and thus no redundancy makes this very conservative (maybe overly) approach sensible. </p>

<p>When setting up an anchor on a single point you have no redundancy, so you want to be very sure that the point itself (tree, rock, ...) is actually stable and your extension is safe. Focusing on the webbing this means abrasion and cutting on anything along its way. It needs to be either not touching anything at all or be protected by laying something between the rock and the webbing. In both cases you need to consider that the rope with the climber may shift around. But all of this is true for a double strand of webbing as well. If you have a setup which leads to one strand getting cut there is a very high probability that the second one (being parallel) will be severed as well.</p>

<p>In the end the problem is the borderlineish strength: It is a good idea to be on the safe side and use two strands. The much bigger problem with single point anchors is the reliability of the point itself and abrasion/cutting of the webbing on rock. So you gain more using more than one point, where a single strand is certainly ok. </p>

","<p>As the comments have mentioned, grades vary somewhat between gyms, but I think you can still provide some rough guidelines.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Peg boards can probably be done by anyone at any climbing level. You're not stressing your fingers really, so there's little chance of injury. It's essentially like practicing pull-ups. It probably won't help your climbing too much (except for lock-off moves).</p></li>
<li><p>You should be at least a solid V4-5 climber to start hangboarding. You should be able to do <strong>crimpy</strong> climbs at that grade range, since that is basically what hangboarding is. If you can hold onto a hangboard grip >15 seconds, you're probably not stressing your fingers too much (thus, relatively safe). But make sure to take it easy at first and stop at the first sign of pain. Also, make sure to take at least a day off between hangboard workouts.</p>

<p>For hangboarding, you could start even earlier if you wear a harness and attach a weight on the other side of a pulley system to take weight off your fingers.</p></li>

"Leader injured during multipitch trad climb, what to do?","1499","","<p>I've been working on improving my self-rescue skills, but the skills I've learned so far seem to pertain mostly to single-pitch climbing. For example, a lot of people emphasize knowing how to escape a belay, which is fine, but that seems to be mostly applicable to the situation where you're giving someone a belay from below on a single-pitch climb, you can't just lower them (maybe because they'd end up on a ledge), and you need to run and get help.</p>

<p>If you're in the middle of a multi-pitch climb, it seems like it escaping the belay may not be relevant, or may at best be only part of the solution.</p>

<p>I'm sure there are many different possible self-rescue situations that could come up in multipitch trad. But one likely-seeming situation I can come up with is that I'm giving someone a lead belay, he gets injured too badly to be able to up- or downclimb, and we have more than half the rope out, so I can't just lower him all the way.</p>

<p>What do you do in this situation? My best guess would be to lower him down to the lowest piece of protection I can get him to, escape the belay, ascend the rope, improve that piece of pro to a solid anchor, secure him to the anchor, and free the rope from the gear higher up (either by climbing and cleaning, or by untying and pulling the rope through). Then maybe clip him in to the rope with a locking biner, lower him to the belay station, have him unclip, and then rap down to the belay station myself (possibly leaving a lot of gear). Wow, this seems complicated and difficult, especially if I can't see the situation clearly from the belay station.</p>

<p>I think a solution to this problem would also pretty much apply to single-pitch climbing in an area where it's not possible to run and get help, e.g., because you're in a remote area.</p>

<p>Question: what would be some general strategies for dealing with this type of situation?</p>
","<p>To start with, each situation will be different.  E.g. if you have an overhang and your partner is hanging freely in space, you may need to handle things a bit differently.  Lowering an unconscious leader is also dangerous, as lower-angle terrain can exacerbate their injuries, and getting them caught on an unseen ledge could introduce slack.  Also, if you have a sufficiently strong tag line, tying it to the end of the rope and removing some of the lower pieces of protection may allow you to lower the leader down.  I suggest viewing the various self-rescue skills as a toolkit, from which you assemble a plan for each situation.  Escaping the belay is one of many tools you have to work with.  Some of the basics you should be well-practiced in include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Locking-off and escaping the belay</li>
<li>Tandem and counterbalance rappels</li>
<li>Transferring loads between the rope and anchor</li>
<li>Ascending a rope</li>
<li>Roped-solo techniques</li>
<li>Basic first aid</li>
<li>Passing a knot</li>
<li>Rigging hauling systems</li>
</ul>

<p>The scenario mentioned is particularly dangerous since you have no idea if the top-most piece is still safe to climb on.  (The original fall might have nearly pulled it out.)  For a very general solution, I'd suggest the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Assess the situation and make a plan.  Is there anyone else who can help?  Is there an easier way to get above the leader?  Is the leader conscious?  </li>
<li>Escape the belay and beef up your anchors.  Make any necessary adjustments to your anchor (e.g. for direction of pull).  If the leader is still conscious, they may be able to place additional protection or give you more information.</li>
<li>Get to your leader.  As mentioned, you don't know how secure the rope is.  If you have a second rope you may want to consider roped solo techniques.  Alternatively you can ascend the rope.  Fix any immediate life threats, (although anything that serious will probably already have killed them).</li>
<li>Construct a proper anchor and transfer the leader's weight to it.  You will likely need to return to the bottom anchor to lower them onto the new anchor.  Once this is done, you can return to the leader to set up a lower or rappel.</li>
<li>Administer any needed first aid and re-assess your plan.  If this new anchor is sufficiently low, it may allow you to do a tandem rappel to the original belay station.  Otherwise, you may want to lower them first.</li>

<p>To understand the meaning I like the visualization from the <a href=""https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominanz_%28Geographie%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">German Wiki</a> where </p>

<ul>
<li>""Dominanz"" means <strong>isolation</strong> and </li>

<p>Isolation is the distance to the next point with the same height (radius) of a higher mountain. So the nearest higher mountain seen from B is A, see the distance marked as ""Dominanz"".</p>

<p>Prominence is the difference from the peak to the next key col to which you have to descend <em>at least</em> to be able to reach a higher peak. So from summit B you have to descend at least to the col between B-C, therefore the marked ""Schartenhöhe"". The col between B-B' is not relevant because B is the higher peak.</p>

Bouldering is a great way to learn technique and develop strength because you're doing short strenuous climbs that usually revolve around doing one or two very specific moves, as a beginner you almost learn a new move every time you climb a new problem, especially if you're with a group of people all trying to project the same problem, because unlike sport climbing where you're usually by yourself up on the wall, bouldering is a very social sport, with a group of people all hanging out on the ground while one person tries the problem out at a time.</p>

<p>A few exercises you can do on your own to learn more balance and climb more static, is first of all, learn how to <em>crimp</em>, and climb more routes that use lots a <em>tiny</em> <strong>crimps</strong> and slopey <strong>sloper</strong> holds. Crimps and slopers are terrible to hang onto, as you can easily pop or slide off just by changing your body position, they also require a lot of finger and core strength, which makes them perfect for learning how to static climb, because you're forced to learn balance in order to make any use out of them. Teeny tiny crimps are one of my favorites because you can't just grab at them like a big jug, you have to get your fingertips on them, settle into a good crimp and then lock off your thumb before shifting your weight. Slopers are another favourite for a couple of reasons, first of all they're next to impossible to injure yourself on-they're very tendon friendly (unlike crimps)-secondly, they give you <em>great</em> abs. Slopers are the holds you notice a lot of people screaming in the gym to hang onto them, that's because you have to tense up your core a lot in order to keep them.</p>

<p>I used to practice crimps and balance by traversing my local wall <em>(which was textured)</em> without using <em>any</em> holds. It took me a very <em>long</em> time before I had fianlly figured out the beta to get all the way across, and there'd be some parts where I'd be flexing every part of my body just so I could cross my left hand one hand width over my right.</p>

<p>Footwork is hugely important when static climbing, one drill you can try to teach yourself better footwork is to consciously move your feet two or three times every time you move a hand once. Footwork is key for good balance. Another way to learn footwork is to climb one-handed. with only one hand on the wall, you naturally are forced to rely a lot more on your feet. </p>

<p>Lastly, another fun drill to try in order to make you climb more statically is to <strong>climb blindfolded</strong>. You aren't going to be dynoing to anything you can't see, and being blind naturally makes you <em>very</em> cautious, so you slow down and spend more time feeling your balance trying to find holds in places that make sense for how your body is balanced vs. trying to jump up and grab that big tempting jug you can see higher on the wall.</p>

<p>Static climbing is ""smarter"" climbing, the more you think your way through a climb, the more static you're going to be.</p>

"What is a good starter kit for beginning indoor climbing?","1484","","<p>If I want to get started on indoor climbing, what is the bare minimum I need to have, assuming I don't want to rent equipment?</p>
","<p><strong>Shoes</strong> and a <strong>harness</strong>.  Some places don't have <strong>belay devices</strong> or <strong>carabiners</strong> attached to each rope, so check on that beforehand, as you may need to provide your own.</p>

<p>That's it.</p>

<p>Chalk and a chalk bag is something you'll probably want pretty quickly and often comes packaged with the harness.</p>

<p>For climbing shoes, look for something comfortable to wear for a couple hours but tight like a slipper.  Imagine that you're going to be standing on your toes a lot, so you want a direct link from toe, to shoe, to wall.  The same tightness should extend all around the toe box (i.e. gaps along your big toe or towards your smaller toes are bad).</p>

<p>For a harness, just aim for comfort - you'll spend a lot of time hanging on the rope early in your climbing career, so a bit of padding won't hurt you.  Lots of harnesses have a ton of ""gear loops"", but for indoor you can get the simplest one possible, just somewhere to hang your chalk bag, if that.  Padded leg loops are worthwhile though, as is a simple way to get in and out of it, and an obvious way to check that you are properly strapped in.</p>

<p>Belay device - hopefully they have a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigri_%28climbing%29"">GriGri</a> attached to each rope.  If not, consider buying one if you can spare the cash.  Otherwise, just get a simple <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belay_device"">ATC</a>-style device and call it a day.  In order to attach your belay device to your harness, you'll need a carabiner.  Most people prefer medium-large pear-shaped locking carabiners for this purpose, but any large, D-shaped locking carabiner will do the job too.</p>

"Why bring a multitool on long treks?","1482","","<p>I have been trekking for years now, mostly in Scandinavia, Canada and Peru. For most of treks we had to be sustainable and carry food for 10-14 days at a time - so weight is always a big issue.</p>

<p>Obviously this requires very optimized equipment, and for this reason I never considered bringing a multitool (like a <a href=""http://www.victorinox.com/ch/category/Swiss-Army-Knives/1008?f=category&amp;v=1/100/1008&amp;m=add&amp;"">swisstool</a> or <a href=""http://www.leatherman.co.uk"">leatherman</a>): personally I just never saw the benefit of such a tool, as out in the wild I essentially never encountered situations that would call for pliers, screwdrivers, or any of the other sophisticated tools.</p>

<p>However, over the years I have seen plenty of people who absolutely swear by their multitools and bring them on every occasion, including long hikes or trekking trips.</p>

<p>I'd like to know of you:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why do you bring your multitool on long trips?</li>
<li>What kinds of purposes does it serve, which a normal knife can't?</li>
</ul>
","<p>There's always a difference between required and excessive. A lot of these multi tools have specific purposes. Do I require a screwdriver on a trek?  Mostly no. Will I use a knife, a pair of scissors or even a pair of tweezers? Mostly Yes.</p>

<p>So do I recommend carrying a multi tool to a trek? Yes. But having said that, there are multitude of these tools out there. What one needs to look at is the one which makes sense for a trek. I have multitools which have the basic knife-scissor-tweezer-pin combination and also another one with a screwdriver-plier combination. I do not carry the screwdriver ones on treks. They are heavy and pretty much useless. </p>

<p>What all have I used my multi tools for?</p>

<ul>
<li>Cutting fruits, opening cans, opening up packed food.</li>
<li>Removing thorns from my fingers using tweezers.</li>
<li>Sewing up my shoes with reamer (a temporary but useful solution).</li>
</ul>

<p>On a lighter note, once when I was on a forest survey, I met a fellow who felt his swiss multi tool knife could provide him sufficient protection against wild animals. So yeah, for some, it might give some mental strength as well :D ;)</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>What a normal knife can't? That  would be a very selective list. And probably one could argue that pretty much everything could be achieved using a normal knife with sufficient skill. Personally I do not use a bigger knife for delicate stuff like removing a splinter ;). Also, I've met folks who do not carry a knife (mostly those going for guided treks) and prefer multi tool instead. I also believe that the human tendency to feel more comfortable with more options has to do with this somehow.</p>

  minimum loss of material strength or durability.</p>

","<p>I don't have specific numbers on strength and durability, but I have had both and repaired both rather often. I work with a scout troop that has currently 22 floating canoes.</p>

<p>The protector we put on both is the same, the hole repair method is the same the only real difference is when you dent or completely wrap the Royalite canoe around a rock. </p>

<p>With the Royalex we would get it to the shore and pull the gear out and if it was a small dent just pop it back out, usually with a kick. If it were completely wrapped then a little jumping on it might be called for. </p>

<p>When our Royalite canoes dent you can pop it back out but there is a meaner sound to it and the creases where it was bent look much worse. When we wrapped a Royalite canoe around a rock it looked so bad after getting it flat enough to get it off the river that we ended up not using it again. </p>

<p>Bottom line we don't use them in white water any more. We use rafts or Inflatables. If you're not going to be in whitewater then it doesn't matter as much. If you are then the question becomes one of will there be porting? No porting then the weight saving is not that big of a deal. </p>

<p>Update: I went out and checked the canoes, and our maintenance records. The Royalite ones seem to get deeper holes more often and crack at a much younger age. I knew I didn't like them for white water but I think I will steer clear of them after this realization.</p>

"How to anchor a raft on a river","1471","","<p>The past couple years I've been taking a homemade raft out onto the Charles River in Boston to see the fireworks on July 4th (think an old boxspring mattress holding 4 people). One problem we always run into is anchoring the boat in the middle of the river (about 10-20ft deep, ~5mph current). </p>

<p>I'd like to have the raft anchored to stay in a specific orientation (so it's easier to view the fireworks), and also strong enough to not move downstream. What kind of anchors should I use, what weight, and how many? Also, is there a specific technique used to drop anchors?</p>

<p>Previously, I tried just attaching 2 10lb weights and dropping them on opposite sides of the raft, but that didn't work out well. We still seemed to be drifting and turning. Any suggestions would be much appreciated!</p>
","<p>If you want to remain stationary, you need a solid anchor, and the best option is going to be to attach to a tree or something that you can securely fix to on the bank.</p>

<p>Not knowing that river, I can't say whether that would work or not, so I'll discuss anchoring to the bottom. This is the same procedure for anchoring in a tide or a river, except in a river you only need to worry about water in one direction, which is a lot more straightforward.</p>

<p>In the sea the rule of thumb is to use an anchor rode 8 times as long as the water depth. This way, you are never pulling the anchor up, but always along the bottom - which aids friction. 8 may be overkill here, but perhaps 4 times is a good idea.</p>

<p>Ideally, you'll want two anchors, each on a short length of chain (to help weigh down the rope nearest the anchor - to help further with keeping it on the bottom) with a nylon rope; and row so the two anchors are each 45 degrees off due upstream. Once they are both set, allow your raft to drift out to the full length of the ropes. With each rope attached at one corner of the raft, you should have a nice stable platform.</p>

  all the ""opening"" in the skin necessary for bacteria to enter.
  However, there are some things you can do decrease risk.</p></li>
  <li><p>The single biggest preventative measure is keeping the skin intact!</p></li>

  ointment and keep one in your car, your desk, your exercise bag, and
  at home.</p></li>
  <li><p>Take care with your children, impressing upon them the importance of cleanliness.</p></li>
  <li><p>Be respectful to protect others from infection if you suspect that you may have a Strep infection, such as Strep throat, or have been
  exposed to someone with a known Strep infection. Symptoms do not have
  to be present for a person to be carrying the bacteria and infect
  others. One case of infection that comes to mind is a health care
  worker with two children at home with Strep throat. She had no
  symptoms, but innocently infected three people, one of whom died.</p></li>

  <p><strong>These simple measures are the most protection one can give oneself

  a pin prick (one woman became infected at the point of entry from a
  blood draw) can be the opening it takes.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The spread of all types of GAS infection can be reduced by good hand
  washing, especially after coughing and sneezing and before preparing
  foods or eating. Persons with sore throats should be seen by a doctor
  who can perform tests to find out whether the illness is strep throat.
  If the test result shows strep throat, the person should stay home
  from work, school, or day care until 24 hours after taking an
  antibiotic. All wounds should be kept clean and watched for possible
  signs of infection such as redness, swelling, drainage, and pain at
  the wound site. A person with signs of an infected wound, especially
  if fever occurs, should immediately seek medical care. It is not
  necessary for all persons exposed to someone with an invasive group A
  strep infection (i.e. necrotizing fasciitis or strep toxic shock

  in certain circumstances, antibiotic therapy may be appropriate. That

<p>The article states, quoting microbiologist Amy Horneman:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Infections caused by the bacterium are relatively easy to treat with common antibiotics -- but only if recognized in time. ""There are certain drugs that just don't work,"" she said. ""The best drugs to use are Ciprofloxacin and Bactrim (also SXT, Septra)."" </p>
  
  <p>Naturally occurring in water sources throughout the world, Aeromonas hydrophila bacterium has many positive contributions to the eco-system, she said.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""When I heard about the case, and I heard she fell in the water and got a deep cut... I thought, 'It must be Aeromonas hydrophila,'"" Horneman said.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""I am not an alarmist,"" she said, noting that she raised two sons and allowed them to participate in water-related sports and activities. ""But I am very aggressive about treating any kind of cut, any kind of wound infection.""</p>

<li>The snowpack is made of many layers of snow which are formed by climate factors from above the snow, <strong>and</strong> within the snow.</li>
<li>These layers create a stratification of the snow crystals where some adhere more to one another than others. </li>
<li>This creates a situation where fractures can occur, and some layers of the snow shift as a unit. </li>
<li>The snow ""unit"" causes more snow to fracture in similar ways. </li>
<li>This sometimes creates a chain reaction we call an <em>""Avalanche""</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Types of Avalanches</h2>

<ol>
<li>Loose Dry
<ul>
<li>Usually limited to surface layers, and pitches at or above 40 degrees</li>
<li>Sometimes called slough, although they can still be very dangerous.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Loose Wet
<ul>
<li>Typically form in spring or summer, due to solar radiation (direct sun).</li>
<li>Usually require slopes of 30 - 40 degrees to initiate.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Wet Slab
<ul>
<li>Generally created by extended periods above freezing.</li>
<li>Pinwheeling, snowballing, and loose wet avalanches are predictors</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Storm snow
<ul>
<li>Caused by a cohesive layer of new snow overloading the sub-surface snow layer bond. </li>
<li>Generally avalanches peak during intense snowfall and decrease 24-36 hours following a storm cycle.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Wind Slab
<ul>
<li>Caused by wind deposited snow building up and overloading the sub-surface layer's bond.</li>
<li>Indicators include ""ribbing"" and ""cornicing"" on leeward slopes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Persistent Slab
<ul>
<li>Caused by a weak bond within the snowpack created weeks, and sometimes months prior to the trigger.</li>
<li>Prediction requires digging a snow test pit, reviewing weather logs over weeks and months, and speaking to local experts. </li>
<li>Very dangerous avalanches result from ""persistent slab"" conditions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Persistent Deep Slab
<ul>
<li>Caused by a thick, hard, and deep slab of snow loosing it's bond with sub-surface layers.</li>
<li>Most commonly caused by early season snowpack being exposed to long periods dry weather.</li>
<li>Most common above tree line. </li>
<li>Prediction requires digging a snow test pit, reviewing weather logs over weeks and months, and speaking to local experts. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cornice Falls
<ul>
<li>Avalanches caused by large quantities of wind blown overhanging snow fracturing and falling onto a slope. </li>
<li>Most common on leeward slopes where a ridgeline breaks the wind.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h2>Signs of Unstable Snow</h2>

<ol>
<li>Whoompfing - A sound the snow makes (just say the word) when the sub-layer fractures from the surface layer. 
<ul>
<li>Sometimes creates shooting surface cracks.</li>
<li>Check your underwear in steep terrain, it's scary.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Recent Avalanche Activity - Observe the nearby slopes and ridges for activity of sloughing , wet slides, fracturing, or cornacing. 
<ul>
<li>Be aware of the environment around you. Always place your head on a swivel.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hollow sounds - While traveling across the snow surface. 
<ul>
<li>Stay off steep ridgelines, look for terrain elsewhere. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Difficult travel due to breaking through snow layers. 
<ul>
<li>If the snow cannot support you while skinning (traveling to and from steep slopes using grippy ski bottoms), it is not stable. </li>
<li>Consider lower angles or not skiing that area.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h2>Most Common Triggers</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Environmental</p>

<ul>
<li>Loading from new snow.</li>
<li>Temperature or humidity Changes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Human</p>

<ul>
<li>Ski and snowboard travel</li>
<li>Snowmobiling</li>
<li>Explosives</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h2>Reducing Avalanche Risk</h2>

<ol>
<li>Do not stop or group in exposed areas</li>
<li>Do not travel directly above someone in a party.</li>
<li>Do not underestimate the danger of a slab avalanche, or how easy they can be triggered.</li>
<li>Recognize <a href=""http://www.avalanche.ca/cac/training/online-course/terrain/terrain-traps"">terrain traps</a>.</li>
<li>Do Not travel alone, or apart from your party.</li>
<li>Do not become distracted and stay in an exposed place for too long.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Good Habits</h2>

<ol>
<li>Use releasable bindings</li>
<li>Follow low angle slopes </li>
<li>Don't box yourself into a region when the slide will be, always have an escape plan.</li>
<li>Avoid travel on cornices.</li>
<li>Always monitor for environmental signs of avalanche.</li>
<li>Watch for decreasing mental judgement, or influence from <em>""Powder Fever""</em>.</li>
</ol>

<h2>General Avalanche Prediction</h2>

<p>Note this is by <strong>NO</strong> means comprehensive, and is only the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<ol>
<li>Check with the local avalanche prediction center</li>
<li>Follow historical and current weather, and know how they impact the snowpack.</li>
<li>Look for environmental signs of danger. 
<ul>
<li>Cracking</li>
<li>Ribbing</li>
<li>Wind loading</li>
<li>Cornicing</li>
<li>Tree flagging (where the branches have been sheered off)</li>
<li>Nearby avalanche activity</li>
<li>Dig snow pits, and test for snow stability.(Outside scope of article)</li>
<li>Make local pole tests to check for variation.</li>
</ul></li>

"Soft or hard drinking bottle?","1456","","<p>When choosing a water bottle for hiking, a very distinct choice I can make (amongst all the other types of materials and hardiness, size and so on) is weighing up whether to purchase a ""hard"" plastic bottle, or one made from a softer material that can be squashed.</p>

<p>What are the advantages of each, and why might I choose one over the other?</p>
","<p>One of the big differentiators in the past between hard and soft bottles was that soft bottles would absorb some of the flavor from drinks.</p>

<p>I'm not sure how much that affects soft bottles on the market today.</p>

<p>In contrast to what @JustinC said, I believe hard bottles are more likely to explode.  Due to their rigidity they will hold their shape until the pressure reaches a critical point then the bottle would shatter where the soft bottle would deform before reaching the critical pressure.</p>

<p>Also I have had hard bottles break when setting (or dropping) onto a hard surface where a soft bottle would flex.</p>

<p>I have heard of some hikers who will go to extreme lengths to reduce weight in their pack and they use old Gatorade/Powerade bottles since they are lighter weight than even the soft bottles.  But these are much less sturdy and prone to breakage.</p>

<p>Most of the bottles I use are the hard variety, but I believe that is just lingering distrust of the flavor saving of the soft bottles.</p>

<p>I'm not sure about the prescence of BPA in soft vs hard bottles, but that should not be a problem anymore since the majority of bottles do not contain BPA any more.</p>

"During high-altitude lengthy expedition: To shave or not shave?","1449","","<p><em>""Should one be shaving on a lengthy high altitude trek?""</em> shall be the question that I'd like to ask to great mountaineers with wisdom in high-altitude mountaineering.
If you have observed, there are so many mountaineers who do not prefer (or should I say bother?) to shave during an expedition.  </p>

<p>Has it got any scientific or significant reason for they being aberrant, beyond the lethargic approach of being socially good? (<em>Culture is different up there at the mountains</em>)</p>

<p>Of course, a shaving trimmer is a handy instrument to take along, what are the pros and cons of shaving against not shaving, and vice versa?</p>

<p>For example, having a face covered with beard can really keep your jaws from freezing?
But, then do we jeopardize the hygiene, as we may not face wash everyday?</p>

<p>P.S.: I am restricting the scope of the question to Facial Hair only.</p>
","<p>Apart from the practical advantages mentioned in <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/1651/practicality-of-beards"">practicality of beards</a>, there's also some aspects that are special to remote and/or high altitude trekking:</p>

<p>Melting snow to obtain water costs a lot of fuel (and time) which makes water quite a valuable good. You don't want to spend 10% or more of your expensively molten water just to pollute it with shaving soap. It is much easier to just let the beard grow and possibly just trim it with scissors if it should get too long, as this does not require water.</p>

<p>Beside that, shaving can irritate your skin. Especially if done with cold or only lukewarm water and possibly with little shaving soap, you are prone to cause a lot of micro-cuts with your razor. Exposing the skin to cold air afterwards won't make the situation any better.</p>

<p>On the other hand: not washing your face for some days and not <em>that</em> thoroughly over some weeks should not lead to serious hygienic issues (unless your skin is somehow sensitive in that way).</p>

"During a safety stop, how do I avoid my feet floating up?","1444","","<p>On my last couple of dives, I've noticed that my feet tend to float up during the 5m / 3 minute safety stop. It seems to be more of an issue when doing a safety stop using a line to ascend, but I've noticed it to a lesser extent when floating freely for the stop.</p>

<p>During all of these dives, I've been wearing a weight belt. I believe it has always had the appropriate amount of weights on it (varying depending on the tank or wetsuit worn), and I've had no problems achieving and maintaining neutral buoyancy during the dives. During the main part of the dive, I don't have issues with my feet floating above me.</p>

<p>Is there a common reason for why my feet may be floating up during the safety stop, and is there a way to avoid it?</p>
","<p>This should sound more generic than only for a safety stop during a dive.
I had this issue that during the swim as well, that I had to constantly fight to keep from rolling to one side, or to keep my feet from floating towards the surface.</p>

<p>The two most typical problems with swimmers/divers that I saw were :</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The feet looked to have a tendency to move towards the bottom while their upper body moves toward the surface, meaning, that the center of gravity would be so low on the body that, some of the weight needs to be re-positioned towards the shoulders.</p></li>
<li><p>Or the other way round: such that the feet kinda had a tendency to float towards the surface. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>The second is your case I guess. You need more weight closer to the lower half of your body in order to balance the center of gravity. Should you be using ankle weights? 2 lb may be?</p>

<p>One quick notes: If you are in wet suit, and if you think that you are concerned that there is air in your booties,ensure the boots are outside (are not tucked inside) the wet suit leg.</p>

<p>Also, rather than investing in ankle weights right away, before you do so, try a dive with very little gas inside your suit. And, Use your BC to maintain neutral buoyancy. Actually you can practice diving with a minimum of gas inside your dry-suit, It <em>may</em> cause the floaty-feet problem to be solved.</p>

<p>Or another quick solution to try can be: A pair of Aqualung jet fins. I have heard a friend who had resolved the issue with that. But I personally believe more in classic-style to resolve such an issue rather than finding a work-around solution.</p>

<p>P.S.: The re-positioning of the weight should be such that you don't also start experiencing the first problem noted above.</p>

"How to rappel on an over-hanging cliff?","1437","","<p>I have rappelled quite a few times. I have also done commando rappel on shorter patches (up to 100 ft or so). The pic of a cliff that I have attached below is Kokankada. The height to rappel will be around 1800ft into 4 stages. Out of that, probably a 800 ft will be pure overhang. I have rappelled here before, now I want to try a commando rappel at this place.</p>

<p>My question is: How are we supposed to rappel on such a large overhanging cliff? What are do's and don't's?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yKKbA.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>Rappelling is dangerous enough and doing this from very high heights is something to be taken extremely serious (unlike the video link you’ve given). All of the stuff that Kai K. has recommended I would assume you already knows without being told.  In my mind, the piece about commando rappelling (very serious climbers do not do this) seems dangerous. I have been climbing in Yosemite seriously for over a decade and ascended all of the major walls there, so my experience is deep. In all those years, I have never met climber(s) that would do this on a cliff this size.</p>

<p>Since I have done this type of repelling before, I see additional points to stress: </p>

<ol>
<li>If the overhang is severe enough, one issue is being able to stay in contact with the wall. If you bounce or push off the wall with enough force such that you come in contact with the wall again, then it will be easier for you to clip an anchor. If you lose contact with the wall, you could be left in midair which will requires take time and energy to get you back. </li>
<li>If the anchor has no slings, it could be tricky to find them. With large cliff faces as you’ve shown, I would have a daisy chain ready to clip in to an anchor in the case that there are no slings to grab. I have been in situations where I was not been able to find anchors and was force to use jumars (or ascenders) to go back up the rope. This is no small feat if you have not practiced it. If you haven’t, I strongly recommend that you do this by finding a high bridge, tying off a rope and ascending up the rope using jumars. </li>
</ol>

<p>Of course, the best practice in all climb excursions is being able to self-rescue yourself. Good luck to you. </p>

"Spray on waterproofing for non-dwr fabrics?","1436","","<p>I have a pair of knickers I use for bike commuting year round. Since it's the start of the rainy season on the east coast, I was wondering if a spray on waterproofing product such as nikwax spray on would add water repellency to my non-dwr polyester/spandex knickers or is will this treatment perform poorly on non-dwr materials.</p>
","<p>TL;DR - It will help, but it's no magic bullet. </p>

<p>Spray on DWR like nikwax or granger's will help the water bead up for a while when applied to knit fabrics. But the garment will still wet out with any significant rainfall, at best they will keep you from getting wet in a slight drizzle. </p>

<p>Most of these products have specialized versions for different fabrics, nikwax has cotton-proof and versions for fleece garments, etc. I've no idea if these are just different labels or actual real differences in the formulation.</p>

<p>The one thing to be aware of is that using these products will affect the wicking ability of any fabric you apply them to. This is not a big deal for something like a
jacket or overpants, but for layers next to the skin it is likely not worth the effort. </p>

<p>In my experience, the best use for these products is to revive the DWR of something that came with a DWR in the first place. </p>

<p>My question is, do I need a tent to sleep inside a lean-to, or any other gear on top of my sleeping bag?</p>
","<p>IMO you totally don't need a tent. Plenty of people, including me, prefer to sleep out under the stars even if there's no hut. It can be difficult to sleep with a wind blowing across one's face, but that won't be happening inside the hut. It's also off the ground, so you won't be losing heat into the dirt.</p>

<p>Yes, the temperature inside will be the same as outside. Your bag is rated for colder temperatures than you expect, but if you're worried about being too cold, you could bring long underwear, which will also help you to stay comfy in the mornings and evenings around camp. Bring a wool beanie, too. I don't think an emergency blanket is going to be very useful in boosting warmth.</p>

"Do electronics interfere with avalanche beacons","1433","","<p>I have been told that electronics can possibly interfere with avalanche beacons (cell phones, radios, etc., but even flashlights). Is there any truth to this? A source would be helpful, ideally from a beacon manufacturer themselves.</p>

<p>If this is indeed the case, how large is the impact: would it slow down a search, make it impossible, or not measurably change anything?</p>

<p>What can one do to protect themselves from interference by electronics?</p>
","<p>Yes it does, especially mobile phones. </p>

<p>I attended an avalanche course last year. The guide did a very simple demonstration. He powered his avalanche beacon on ""send"" mode, and put it on his backpack over the snow surface. All participants walked away from his beacon in a straight line with their own beacons in ""search"" mode. We all marked in the snow the distance where our own beacon stopped receiving the signal (not all devices have the same search range). </p>

<p>The guide then repeated the exercise with his mobile phone placed 20cm from his beacon. The phone was switched on, he had 3 out of 4 bars of signal (with 4G), and did not make/receive any call or SMS during the test. We again walked away from the beacon in a straight line: Every participant stopped receiving the signal about 10-12m earlier than for the first test. </p>

<p>In conclusion: If you keep your mobile phone in your pockets and you are buried under the snow in an avalanche, the range at which the signal of your device can be detected by other people is significantly reduced! As result, it takes more time to find you, and the risk of death increases. </p>

<p>It is wise to keep your mobile phone in airplane mode: first it saves battery for an emergency, secondly it does not interfere with the avalanche beacon. Third (this is personal): it is OK and feels good from time to time ;-)</p>

<p>As for references:</p>

"Is there special etiquette for hiking the Appalachian Trail (AT) during AT Season","1432","","<p>Is there any special etiquette or ""good things to know"" for hiking a section of the Appalachian Trail (AT) during AT, or peak, season (for that section)?</p>
","<p>I think what you are trying to get at is the proper etiquette for hiking on the AT during peak season, when the most hikers and backpackers are on the trail. Exactly when peak season is, and how many people you will see at peak season really depends on where you are on the trail. Various places will have different number of Thru-hikers, section-hikers, weekend backpackers, and day hikers.</p>

<p>My experience is mostly hiking the parts of the AT in Virginia and North Carolina. We see Northbounders and Southbounders cross as well as lots of day and weekend activity.</p>

<p>Etiquette I would break into things you really need to be aware of and just nice things to do. As a day hiker I would say to be very aware of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Step off the trail and allow backpackers access to the trail and passing each other. Backpackers usually give the uphill hiker ""right of way"" but day hikers have less weight and should always accommodate the backpackers.</li>
<li>Be especially careful of trash that you may leave behind, as the number of hikers increases the importance of this increases</li>
<li>Be especially careful about staying on the trail, including switchbacks. As numbers of hikers increase and it rains erosion can get worse.</li>
</ul>

<p>As for things I find that are good to do, and I would consider good etiquette are:</p>

<ul>
<li>I bring additional materials like water, first aid, and fresh snacks. If I run into a thru-hiker or section hiker I give any additional materials I have to them. </li>
<li>I also bring a couple of spare trash bags that I keep in my day pack to pick up some of the trash left by other hikers, again, peak season this becomes even more important.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, you mention hiking, but there is one important etiquette item I would want to add for backpackers during peak season for thru-hikers. Bring your own tent/tarp, even if you expect to stay near a shelter. If more hikers end at a shelter than the shelter can hold I always stay in my own tent to make sure thru-hikers get the shelter.</p>

"Rappelling in the Rain","1430","","<p>Last night I had a nightmare that I was 5 pitches off the ground and it started to pour rain. When I woke up I realized I have no idea how to deal with this.</p>

<p>Asking around, everyone says two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Don't get caught in this situation. Plan better than that.</li>
<li>Rappel down.</li>
</ol>

<p>In reality, I <em>do</em> plan better than this. But I believe in being prepared. <strong>How do you rappel in the rain?</strong>  What are the challenges? I assume the problem is that the rope is mad slippery. Is that the only problem? How do you deal with that?</p>
","<p><em>Disclaimer - I should mention that my answer only applies in the context of the original question.  I'm discussing my experience rappeling in a rock climbing context, using a dynamic single or half rope, a ""stich-plate"" or tubular belay device, and an autoblock backup (not a prussik).  I can't speak to rappeling in caving (where the gear would be different) or in rescue situations (where you'd be rappeling with the weight of 2 or more people)</em></p>

<p>Actually, rappelling down a wet rope is about the same.  Its just that everything else in climbing becomes more dangerous when its raining.  :)</p>

<p>I live on the east coast of the US, and we get rain pretty frequently.  There's about a 30% chance of scattered thunderstorms nearly every day, and rain is just a fact of life.  I get rained off a route maybe once a year.</p>

<p>While I can't say I enjoy it, actually rappelling down a known rappel route in the rain isn't all that bad, especially if you can stay tied into a rope system the whole time (i.e, you don't have to scramble unroped along a ledge to get to a rappel anchor).</p>

<p>The rope dynamics don't seem to change all that significantly.  I always rappel with a regular tubular belay device and an auto-block backup, and I usually rappel with the device in ""high friction"" mode. (note - I also use a 9.8mm or thicker rope)  I would think that the rope would get slipper-ier, but it seems like the ropes get thicker and heavier when they're wet, so maybe that counteracts it some (my rope is supposedly ""dry treated"", but gets fatter anyway). </p>

<p><strong>What is more dangerous</strong></p>

"What to do if the second seems stuck and absolutely no communication is possible?","1427","","<h2>Backstory:</h2>

<p>A few months ago, I experienced the following situation: We (two people) were climbing the last pitch of a multi-pitch route. Near the end, there was a cave-like chimney. Basically a chimney where the opening was narrower than the chimney itself, and the whole thing getting narrower towards the top.</p>

<p>When I lead that pitch, I had no problem going up, noticing that I had to leave the chimney because the top opening was too narrow for my helmet, downclimbing a meter and continuing on the outside. When I was belaying the second, she got stuck inside the ""cave"" because of her backpack with no way of going up, down or out. The whole situation looked a bit like this (left: side view, right: front view):</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wecd0.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wecd0.png"" alt=""Situation""></a></p>

<p>Our problem in that situation was that we absolutely couldn't communicate (cave roof between us, open sea to the back, so no echo), and I had no way of knowing what was happening down there. She finally solved the situation by letting go, falling for at most half a meter and then (with great difficulty) wiggling out of the cave. If I had known that she needed to be lowered like 1-2&nbsp;m, the whole situation would have been solved in a minute, but like this, it took like 15. </p>

<h2>Question:</h2>

<p>While it worked out fine in our situation, what is the generally recommended way of handling a situation where the second seems stuck and absolutely no communication is possible? Also, what would have been the appropriate reaction of she hadn't been able to move?</p>

<p>This is mainly about how to handle such a situation if you haven't prepared specifically. However, recommendations about preparing for the case of such a situation are also welcome, if this doesn't make my question too broad!</p>
","<p>Of course you want to try simple things first, and waiting is a really simple thing to do. She solved the problem in 15 minutes, which doesn't even seem like an especially long time to me to wait for a second to do a pitch. It could take that long to clean a stuck piece of gear. Another simple solution would be to bring radios in the future, but that doesn't help you in this case. I assume you didn't each have a cell phone in your pack.</p>

<p>If you've exhausted the simple options (say it's been an hour and nothing is happening), this becomes more of a self-rescue situation, and self-rescue is based on improvising a solution using the gear you have and the techniques you know. Often in self-rescue, lowering the climber is the easiest solution. It would have worked here, but you had no way of knowing that, and it could have been dangerous to lower. So...</p>

<p>If you were giving her a direct belay, then tying off the belay is trivial. If you were belaying off of your harness, then you need to know how to escape the belay, which is an important and fundamental self-rescue skill to practice.</p>

<p>If you had less than half the rope out, then you could rappel down on a second strand to see what was up. However, you would need to formulate a plan to make sure you could get back up without having to solo the route, e.g., using a Prusik. The decision whether to attempt this might depend on the difficulty of the route. Because you can't extract your belay device from the system, you would need to do the rappel using an alternate technique such as a Munter.</p>

<p>Another option might be to go and get help. Obviously that has disadvantages, but it beats attempting a self-rescue by a sketchy method that might get you killed. One of the basic rules of first aid and self-rescue is not to create additional victims.</p>

<li>AWD (Are roads groomed, muddy,...?)</li>
</ol>

<p>I am intersted in what I really need, (to not get stranded).</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
","<p>In my experience, most of the trailheads in the Boulder, RMNP area are accessible to little cars almost the whole time they are open. I'm not saying all are, but most.</p>

<p>That said, you could easily go three ways with the choice of vehicle:</p>

<p>AWD, little clearance -- Something like a Subaru will get you to almost all the trailheads that are open almost all the time. You might occasionally have to pick a different trailhead, but most of the time it'll be just fine. (This is what lots of people would recommend, with good reason.) </p>

<p>4x4, high clearence -- An Xterra or similar small suv on a truck frame, will get you to basically every trailhead at any time. I personally wouldn't go this route in the Boulder area, because I feel like it's totally overkill. You won't every have to pick a different trailhead, but the extra gas money and higher purchase price isn't worth it in my mind.</p>

<p>little car -- Something like a civic will get you to <strong>a</strong> (not maybe the one you want) trailhead anytime you want. This would be my personal choice, you'll have to pick a different trailhead once in a while, but most of the trails in Boulder are accessible to little cars most of the time. If you're not open to changing plans get an AWD with a little clearance.</p>

<p>TL:DR -- Most of the trailheads are accessible by almost any car. A bit of extra clearence and AWD might make you more comfy, but are probably not needed.</p>

","<p>British mountaineer Andy Kirkpatrick has quite a bit of useful information regarding how to look after your feet at altitude and in cold conditions on his website at <a href=""http://www.andy-kirkpatrick.com/articles/view/how_to_avoid_frostbitten_feet"">http://www.andy-kirkpatrick.com/articles/view/how_to_avoid_frostbitten_feet</a>.</p>

"Combine backpack and back protection when snowboarding?","1414","","<p>In the past I have mostly been snowboarding with a simple every-day backpack to hold some lunch and other small stuff. But since it's very loose, not waterproof and not spacious enough sometimes I'm now thinking about getting the right equipment, buying a proper backpack and maybe an emergency kit with a shovel etc. </p>

<p>But upon researching backpacks I started wondering: A lot of them already have at least some sort of a padded back to provide some protection - like this one</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uzKAXm.jpg"" alt=""Backpack with back protection""></p>

<p>So do I then even need a dedicated back protection on top of that?</p>

<p>What I have found about this on the internet is <a href=""http://snowheads.com/ski-forum/viewtopic.php?p=2243393"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this discussion on snowheads</a> where the tone mostly seems to be in favor of dropping the extra protector (<strong>unless of course</strong> you ride without backpack on a given day) especially if you carry a shovel back there anyway.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.kori.se/en/products/this-is-kori/back-protector-backpack-alpine-skiing-snowboard/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This company</a> seems to want to tackle this problem by selling a true protector that can unfold into a backpack, but it seems to me the major benefits of a backpack (separate compartments, structure, waterproof sections...) are then lost. </p>

<p>So my questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Should you wear back protection under your backpack?</li>
<li>Is it disturbing or even unsafe to combine the two? Might things start to slide out of position?</li>
<li>Should I be looking for a backpack with no proper padding if I wear a protector?</li>
</ul>
","<p>I think the answer is, <strong>it depends</strong>... :)</p>

<p>Snowboard back protectors come in several guises, some better than others:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bv5sE.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FzJCP.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Snowboard packs (with protectors) are similar. I would suggest that a protector (stand alone, not built into a pack) is going to offer much better protection than any back pack can offer. </p>

<h2>Main difference</h2>

<p>The main difference appears to be how the back protector is held against your back. There is a big difference to a protector made so that is held tightly to your back via several <strong>wide</strong> straps and a back pack with a thin waist band and a couple of shoulder straps. (similar to the one in the pack you mention). the back pack is going to move if you fall, the body armour isn't, thus it will provide better protection.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now on top of this you don't mention what kind of terrain your boarding on? Is it off or on-piste, etc. The more difficult and dangerous the terrain the better the back protection your going to want. </p>

<p>If it's simple on-piste green run, I'm sure a back pack (with some protection in it) will be fine. If your planning on heli-snowboarding, I'd invest in a good level back protector/body armour. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it disturbing or even unsafe to combine the two? Might things start
  to slide out of position?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, I don't see why it would be? Providing you wear the protector under your pack... :) 
Providing the back protector is fitted correctly (typically under you coat, etc.) putting a pack on top isn't going to make any difference.</p>

"Are used climbing shoes safe?","1412","","<p>We have several used gear shops locally, which also sell climbing shoes.  I'm looking to start climbing and I am considering buying used shoes to save cost.  Is it ever safe to buy used shoes, and if so, what would indicate that a pair is no longer ""safe""?</p>
","<p>Safe? Yes. As in your life usually doesn't depend on them. Safe, as in a safe buy? Also yes. </p>

<p>When looking at used climbing shoes it really helps if you take someone along who knows what to look for and/or knows the shoes themselves. If you know what they look like new then you know what they should look like. </p>

<p>Specifically, check the seams and make sure they aren't coming apart. Especially the seam around the thickest part of rubber on the soles. If it looks like it starting to pull away at all stay away. </p>

<p>Check the rubber on the bottom. If it has deep gouges or long cuts in it, then the previous owner probably didn't take care of them and might have even hiked in them. </p>

<p>Often times you can find shoes in nearly new condition this way. Plenty of people make the mistake of buying everything and finding out they don't like rock-climbing, or picking shoes like they would any other shoes and have to bring them back because they don't fit right. </p>

<p>I would highly recommend you try to find somewhere to rent the shoes and try them out first. Or go to an indoor gym and try them. </p>

<p>For the fit, they should be sock tight (which is why I don't wear socks with them). Your first time wearing them, your feet should be in pain after climbing in them for an hour or two. </p>

<p>For your first pair I recommend a mostly flat sole, for ""all-around"" use. They usually do alright in any situation and they are often times cheapest (not always). As you get more experience you will learn what you need. </p>

I bought myself a hardshell kayak for about 300$ more and next Monday I will paddle the first time to work. Let's see how this turns out.</p>

It's been now 3 Weeks, my hands are a bit sore, i lost 2kg, and i'm feeling better than ever.
I was lucky with the Weather so far except one little storm, which was pretty exciting and gave me a good adrenalinerush.
I can store the Kajak at the shore, because pretty much everyone was so excited to hear that i'm commuting with it, that i even got a place for it with a roof for free. If it happens that you'd be able to commute by kajak, do it! It's the best anti-stress activity ever. It takes me around 5 minutes to get it in/out of the water and crossing the lake is another 15-20 minutes.</p>

After nearly a year of commuting by kajak i paddled from Zürich to Amsterdam, it took me 17 days to get there and i got some valuable experience out of this trip. For electricity i used 2 powerbanks in combination with a Solar Panel. Next time i go on a trip like that i'll look into buying new wheels for the boat, as you want the axis in the middle of the boat so you don't have to lift the whole weight of the packed boat. The Rhine is a wonderful River to travel on, allthough there's alot of traffic on it if you know how to handle it it's no problem at all. I'd never paddle the Rhine-Amsterdam Canal again because there are no places to get out, the waves can be lethal and the wind will tire you before you know it (it's the Netherlands which means the wind blows from the ocean inlands without being slowed down by forests or mountains).

"Keeping Single Item Cold While Backpacking For 2 Days","1406","","<p>My friends and I are going backpacking and want to keep a single item cold for 2-3 days.  Freezing is not a problem - preferably the closest to being frozen as possible. It is medication that may be needed in case of emergencies. It's about the size of a large snickers</p>

<p>Our idea is to buy some kind of snap-cold pack and place our belongings in a small cooler filled with ice water. We only have to carry this stuff for 2 days, max, so the weight won't be too big of an issue.</p>

<p>Are there better was of approaching this? What gel packs have backpackers used?</p>
","<p>One suggestion, which you will need to try by experiment - dry ice on the bottom of a Thermos. Pack some layers of insulation on top of the dry ice, and put the item on top, with a thermometer so you can keep an eye on temperatures.  Adjust the insulation to get the temperature sitting where you want it. The thermometer can be checked though the trip and insulation adjusted if needed. </p>

<p>Do not seal the thermos tight - the dry ice is CO2, and the gas released as it evaporates needs to escape or pressure will build up.</p>

<p>Normal Ice might last a few days in a good Thermos, but its melts to water - the container the item is is need to be water proof and thermo needs to be sealed. Its unlikely you will be able to maintain below freezing for much more than a day. </p>

<p>As far a Thermos goes, a glass vacuum one is usually the most efficient and relatively light, but prone to breakage. If a stainless steel one keeps the item cold enough for the time, it would be my preference. Bigger will hold more dry ice and stay cooler longer than a smaller one. </p>

"While backpacking, should one bring hand sanitizer, soap, or both?","1397","","<p>What are the advantages of hand sanitizer over soap on a backpacking trip? Do they fulfill the same purpose?</p>

<p>What would you recommend for hand sanitization?</p>
","<p>The two products have some commonality of use but a different focus. Both have their place.</p>

<ul>
<li>Soap is good for many things.    </li>
<li>Sanitiser is an excellent companion when squatty toilets or dead animals in your water supply must be dealt with - read on ...</li>
</ul>

<p>Soap is used (as I know, you know) for cleaning - it removes contaminants that are hard or essentially impossible to remove by rubbing or scraping or by use of water alone. It essentially must have water to work and it needs water to rinse it away after it has done its job. It's use as a sanitiser is important but a secondary result of  its main role. ie by removing material from your hands (or clothes or elsewhere) it also removes contaminants that may cause disease. Soap by itself does not kill germs very well - instead it <strong>removes</strong> them. If the water source used with soap is biologically contaminated, the final rinsing off of the soap may leave your hands looking clean but actually quite 'germ' covered. If you washed your hands with soap in a small stream where there was a dead animal carcass slightly up stream, or where the water was faecally contaminated, there is a good chance that they would look misleadingly safe and clean. You could carry the water you used for washing, or for final rinsing, but the former would be undesirable from a weight aspect, and carrying rinsing water introduces  unusual cleaning patterns (wash in stream, rinse from bottle) and also incurs a weight and volume penalty. </p>

<p>Hand sanitisers deal with  germs by killing them '<em><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ"" rel=""nofollow"">in situ</a></em>'. They do not primarily remove biological contaminants but instead render them inactive. Depending on the sanitiser used they may be a good solvent as well, so may be useful to remove a degree of soiling. However, the volumes available and/or used are usually small and sanitisers such as ethyl alcohol tend to evaporate too fast to be used as an effective gross surface cleaner when used in small volumes. Because they do not need to utilise a local water source they are immune to the effects of local contamination. But if eg you had blood on your hands, or faeces, or had vomited, the sheer physical overload of contamination could render the sanitiser ineffective unless you used very substantial quantities. </p>

<p>So - the idea is to have both available, with soap as your primary cleaner, backed up by sanitiser where there was a clear need, or where you were uncertain. In most cases sanitiser is unnecessary. The hardy pioneers never had it (or, rather, they preferred to drink it) and even now, soap is often enough more a luxury item than a necessity for many hikers :-). However, there are occasions when sanitisers will keep you healthy, or alive, when soap won't. It's a good idea not to have to rely on hindsight to determine when these occasions may be :-). </p>

<h2>A Parallel to backpacking</h2>

<p>I have travelled quite a lot in Asia in recent years - cities and travelling rather than hiking. I try to ensure that I  have a small bottle of sanitiser with me at all times - no exceptions if possible. And, I seldom use it. After you have used a few 'squatty' toilets in typical conditions, and then gone to eat a meal, with or without the availability of a water supply for washing, having sanitiser to hand (literally)  becomes very attractive. Even when water is available for washing in such situations, the merits of using it can be uncertain.  </p>

<p>Some dislike sanitisers because of the perceived (or actual) effects on skin, their lack of naturalness etc. Each must decide for themselves the merits of such  concerns. </p>

<h2>Types of sanitisers</h2>

<p>There are two main types of sanitisers, alcohol based and chemical based disinfectants. (You can argue that alcohol is also a chemical disinfectant :-) ).</p>

<p>Alcohol (usually 60% - 85% Ethyl Alcohol, plus a gelling agent plus a bittering agent) will kill 99.9% or so biological contaminants on your skin in seconds. It evaporates without washing or wiping so leaves hands ""guaranteed"" low-germ if not actually no-germ. It's effect on the environment (apart from the part of the environment that you wipe it on) is minimal. Even poured on the ground or in a stream its effects would be extremely localized. A 1cc squirt from a pump bottle will clean two hands up to high wrist level if not actually visibly dirty. So a small 100cc bottle will be ample for most journeys. </p>

<p>An alternative which is gaining favour relatively recently is Benzalkonium Chloride. (Also answers to the names a ""Quaternary ammonium salts"", Lauryl Dimethyl Benzalkonium Chloride, and a few other similar names). This is the disinfectant of your childhood and of ever since. Look at the labels of disinfectants in supermarkets  and you'll find it is used in about 90% of them. Also used as a carpet cleaner, swimming pool disinfectant and moss killer. And more. Used under a vast number of labels and for any applications.  </p>

<p>A 0.1% solution (!) is said by those currently touting it to be as effective as alcohol (by federal certification) and as it leaves a thin residue on your hands it keeps on keeping on. Unlike alcohol.  At low concentrations it is very person-safe and can be used in mouth washes and similar. At 10% - 50% range it's nasty if ingested (ask me how I know :-( )(I won't make that stupid and careless mistake again) but that is an unusually high percentage. Cheapest is in budget disinfectant bottles in supermarkets at about 2%. Water down as required. Very cheap if bought as above. Does not evaporate well (similar to water). Ecologically probably OK in streams etc. once diluted. </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Soap is good for many things. Sanitiser is an excellent companion when squatty toilets or dead animals in your water supply must be dealt with.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Soap and water reduce level to about 0.08 of original<br>
(Will obviously vary with circumstances) </p></li>
<li><p>Use of any sanitiser gives 0.01 on 1st use.</p></li>
<li><p>Mutiple uses of sanitiser in succession give 0.01, 0.0001 2 uses, 0.000001  3 uses (if you can believe the graph cited below)</p></li>

<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3037063/"" rel=""nofollow"">The Effect of Handwashing with Water or Soap on Bacterial Contamination of Hands</a> </p>

<p>They conclude that washing with soap is more effective than water alone BUT under their conditions reduction in bacterial count was to 23% and 8% initially. So, a reduction by a factor of 12 is useful BUT 1/12th of ""too many bugs"" is still ""too many bugs"" in many cases. </p>

<p>I'll try and post some stats later but, based on a manufacturers promo card graph that I have, use of sanitiser gives 99% kill on first use and if you repeat it N times you get most of the survivors killed each time, so results become superb rapidly.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Alcohols and BAQ manage about 99% at 1st use.</p></li>
<li><p>2nd use effectiveness (percentage of survivors killed) is </p>

<ul>
<li><p>95-99% per wash on subsequent washes for 62% or 70% Ethanol</p></li>
<li><p>BAQ 99% 1st use, 99.9% 2nd use, 99.99% 3rd use, around 99.99% per use after that. </p></li>
<li><p>So BAQ is about 1 in 10 to the power of 2, 5, 9, ...<br>
That's somewhat hard to believe! More research needed.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>ABSTRACT:</strong> Handwashing is thought to be effective for the prevention of transmission of diarrhoea pathogens. However it is not conclusive that handwashing with soap is more effective at reducing contamination with bacteria associated with diarrhoea than using water only. In this study 20 volunteers contaminated their hands deliberately by touching door handles and railings in public spaces. They were then allocated at random to (1) handwashing with water, (2) handwashing with non-antibacterial soap and (3) no handwashing. Each volunteer underwent this procedure 24 times, yielding 480 samples overall. Bacteria of potential faecal origin (mostly Enterococcus and Enterobacter spp.) were found after no handwashing in 44% of samples. Handwashing with water alone reduced the presence of bacteria to 23% (p &lt; 0.001). Handwashing with plain soap and water reduced the presence of bacteria to 8% (comparison of both handwashing arms: p &lt; 0.001). The effect did not appear to depend on the bacteria species. Handwashing with non-antibacterial soap and water is more effective for the removal of bacteria of potential faecal origin from hands than handwashing with water alone and should therefore be more useful for the prevention of transmission of diarrhoeal diseases.</p></li>

"How can I vet a hiking partner without potential hard feelings?","1387","","<p>I'm planning a backpacking trip with a well-established partner.

My question is, how do I arrange this vetting without potential hard feelings on the part of the third?</p>

<p>I came up with a couple of options, neither of which I really like:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Invite both the second and the third to a vetting meeting over coffee or something, and be clear with the third what the purpose of the meeting is. If the second approves, this would work fine, but if not, then the third will be understandably hurt. Further, because of this, the second may feel pressured to approve when he would prefer not to.</p></li>
<li><p>Invite both to a vetting meeting, but do not tell the third what the purpose of the meeting is. The issue here is either the lack of a purpose will be suspicious, or a fake purpose will be difficult to produce without seeming fake.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I am sure this situation comes up for others, so I am wondering what the best practice is.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> While we all work at the same place, we commute from different cities. For this reason and others, the logistics of gathering outside working hours may not be practical in the time available.</p>

"How to use a Munter hitch to belay and rappel?","1383","","<p>There seems to be conflicting information on the web about how to use a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munter_hitch"">Munter hitch</a> for belaying and rappelling while rock climbing. The way I learned decades ago is consistent with <a href=""http://store.nols.edu/Store/pc/NOLS-Wilderness-Mountaineering-3rd-Edition-p99.htm""><em>Nols Wilderness Mountaineering</em> by Phil Powers</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Munter hitch differs from a belay device in that the braking position is forward, toward the anchor, rather than back toward the hip. If you rappel using this hitch, be careful to use the Munter with the load strand close to the spine of the carabiner.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A number of videos and blogs suggest that the Munter should be tied with the load strand close to the gate and the break position down towards the hip. They even use an autoblock to back it up and force the downwards break position. (I am not providing links on the off chance I am correct and the information is bad). Have there been new developments regarding the use of a Munter hitch for belaying and rappelling?</p>
","<p>To answer your question as to the ideal break position when using the munter: <strong>It depends</strong>. It depends on your comfort and experience with the knot, its application and the situation.</p>

<p>I have rappeled and belayed with munter-hitches on numeral occasions.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A double stranded munter-hitch rappel provides a significant amount of friction and unless you want to come to a complete stop you will probably be breaking by your hips.</p></li>
<li><p>For single stranded rappels, especially on thin ropes breaking at the hip instead of towards the anchor can be disconcerting. It is doable though, and it is nice to at least know that lifting your arm will stop you.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are rappeling with a load, either in a rescue situation or with a haul-bag, I would highly recommend breaking towards the anchor, at least until you have gotten used to the situation. If you want extra safety in situations like those, check out the <a href=""http://www.animatedknots.com/muntersuper/index.php?Categ=typeslidegrip&amp;LogoImage=LogoGrog.jpg&amp;Website=www.animatedknots.com#ScrollPoint"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Double Munter</a>, which lets you manage heavier loads and has the added benefit of not twisting your rope.</p></li>
<li><p>I would say top-rope belaying, mentioned here for completeness, is the most awkward of applications, since you have to <em>pull</em> rather than <em>release</em> the rope through a shifting knot. I would say it is pretty unlikely you will be doing that for long by pulling towards the anchor, since that is super tiering. Belaying a leader from the ground is slightly less awkward, but still not as nice as belaying from the top, where the munter shines at its best.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The following illustration is from the climbing and mountaineering bible <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1594851387"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Freedom of the Hills</a>, which by the way every aspiring climber should have in his or her bookshelf.</p>

<p>Learning the munter is absolutely not optional. It has saved my behind a couple of times when I have cast off without a belay device. </p>

<p>I wouldn't recommend using the munter though unless for practice or in situations when absolutely necessary, since it turns the rope into a twisted mess.</p>

<p>Related </p>

<p><a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/13222/"">How should one properly dispose of a rabid animal carcass?</a> </p>
","<p>In order to understand the question of rabies and whether or not an animal is rabid, a little background information is necessary. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Once rabies infection occurs, the virus grows in muscle tissue and may go undetected for several days or months. During this incubation (or latent) period, the animal appears healthy and shows no sign of infection.</p>
  
  <p>Usually within 1 to 3 months, the virus migrates to the nerves near the site of the infection and spreads to the spinal cord and brain (i.e., the central nervous system). It usually takes from 12 to 180 days to spread through the peripheral nerves to the central nervous system. At this point, the disease progresses rapidly, and the animal begins to show the classic behavioral signs of rabies. The virus spreads to the saliva, tears, breast milk and urine. The animal usually dies in 4 or 5 days.</p>
  
  <p>Rabies causes typical symptoms. The infection progresses in a predictable manner, from the initial prodormal phase to the excitative, or furious, phase to the final paralytic phase. </p>
  
  <p>The <strong>first sign usually is a change in behavior</strong>. Pet owners should be aware that behavioral changes can occur as a result of many conditions, from digestive disorders to poisoning. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Rabid animals usually stop eating and drinking, and may appear to want to be left alone.</strong> After the initial onset of symptoms, the animal may become vicious or begin to show signs of paralysis. Some rabid animals bite at the slightest provocation and others may be somnolent and difficult to arouse. Once the animal shows signs of paralysis, the disease progresses very quickly and the animal dies.</p>
  
  <p><strong>The early symptoms of rabies tend to be subtle, last 2 to 3 days, and include the following:</strong> </p>
  
  <p>•Change in tone of the dog's bark </p>
  
  <p>•Chewing at the bite site</p>
  
  <p>•Fever</p>
  
  <p>•Loss of appetite</p>
  
  <p>•Subtle changes in behavior</p>
  
  <p><strong>The second phase of infection usually lasts 2 to 4 days and not all rabid animals experience it.</strong> Animals that enter immediately into the final paralytic phase are sometimes said to have dumb or paralytic rabies. Animals that spend most of their diseased state in the furious phase are sometimes said to have furious rabies.</p>
  
  <p>An infected dog may viciously attack any moving object, person, or animal; a caged rabid dog will chew the wire, break their teeth, and try to bite a hand moving in front of the cage. Rabid cats will attack suddenly, biting and scratching. Foxes will invade yards and attack dogs, cows, and porcupines.</p>
  
  <p>They may show the following signs: </p>
  
  <p>•Craving to eat anything, including inedible objects </p>
  
  <p>•Constant growling and barking</p>
  
  <p>•Dilated pupils</p>
  
  <p>•Disorientation</p>
  
  <p>•Erratic behavior</p>
  
  <p>•Episodes of aggression</p>
  
  <p>•Facial expression showing anxiety and hyperalertness</p>
  
  <p>•Irritability</p>
  
  <p>•No fear of natural enemies (e.g., wild animals may not be afraid of people)</p>
  
  <p>•Restlessness</p>
  
  <p>•Roaming</p>
  
  <p>•Seizures</p>
  
  <p>•Trembling and muscle incoordination</p>
  
  <p><strong>The third and final phase of infection usually lasts for 2 to 4 days. Initial symptoms include the following:</strong> </p>
  
  <p>•Appearance of choking</p>
  
  <p>•Dropping of the lower jaw (in dogs)</p>
  
  <p>•Inability to swallow, leading to drooling and foaming of saliva (i.e., ""foaming at the mouth"")</p>
  
  <p>•Paralysis of jaw, throat, and chewing muscles</p>
  
  <p>Paralysis then spreads to other parts of the body, the animal becomes depressed, rapidly enters a coma and dies. - <a href=""http://www.healthcommunities.com/rabies/symptoms.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">Health Communities</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Nota Bene</strong>: This also depends on your area. For example the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence_of_rabies#United_Kingdom"" rel=""nofollow"">UK has been free of rabies since 1902.</a> Much of Europe is now rabies free as is Australia. So if you do see an animal in these countries that exhibit some of these symptoms it is very unlikely to be rabies – Note added from the comment of Liam.  </p>

"Hunting bears with a knife?","1374","","<p><em>Michael Strogoff</em> by Jules Verne (1876) describes how Siberian hunters used to hunt bears with nothing but a knife. This was ideally done with a single lethal blow, to damage the fur as little as possible.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Michael Strogoff] was between the bear and the girl. His arm made one movement upwards, and the enormous beast, ripped up by that terrible knife, fell to the ground as a lifeless mass. He had executed in splendid style the famous blow of the Siberian hunters, who endeavor not to damage the precious fur of the bear, which fetches a high price.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://www.sherdog.com/news/articles/2/From-Surviving-the-Streets-of-Russia-to-MMA-The-Story-of-Aleksander-Emelianenko-Part-2-13709"" rel=""nofollow"">A modern source from 2008</a> describes that the bear can be first trapped with a wooden pole, and stabbed afterwards. That could indicate that the Verne passage is an over-simplification of the actual technique.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On whether people really hunt bears with knives:</p>
  
  <p>Emelianenko: Yes, they do. A few years ago there was an unfortunate incident. One sportsman, a world champion in wrestling ... what was he doing? Yes, he was putting a fork under the bear’s neck. [The practice of hunting bears with a knife involves, once the bear is in front of you, placing a long stick with a letter U-shaped end under the bear’s muzzle as it rears up to fight. Once the stick is in place, the bear isn’t able to bring its body down and the hunter stabs it a number of times, ideally killing it instantly.]</p>
  
  <p>And then the bear couldn’t attack him, and he was stabbing it under the ribs in the heart. And as he was stabbing it, that bear swung with its paw. It was dead already -- the paw was its last gasp with all its strength and basically took half of the wrestler’s head off. And of course the other hunters opened fire on the bear, but it was too late. He went to try his luck with a bear, and it didn’t come off.</p>
  
  <p>For me everything is still fine. I’m OK. I’ve done it and it was OK. About half a year ago, it was in Russia, in Siberia. Everything was fine. I put the fork underneath him and stabbed him in the heart. And that was it. The other hunters dismembered, prepared the bear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How exactly are bears hunted with knives? I am specifically looking for the technique used by Siberian hunters in the past, but other examples could also be applicable.</p>

<p>Do these techniques still have practical usage nowadays? I would assume that bullets damage the fur more than a single knife wound.</p>
","<p>Unless you sever the spinal column near the top of the body there is no body injury that can be done with a knife that is going to result in instant death/disablement of any animal. </p>

<p>Any injury that does not completely disable the animals neurological system is going to be dependent on the animal bleeding to the point that they become unconscious. Even if your head is completely removed from your body <a href=""http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2010/12/its-possible-to-briefly-remain-conscious-after-being-beheaded/"" rel=""nofollow"">your brain can function for up to 15 seconds.</a> Best case scenario of a human with a knife is to stop the heart or completely sever the carotid arteries supplying blood to the brain.  </p>

<p>15 seconds in close proximity to an injured bear is likely to be an experience that last the rest of your life. </p>

  <p><strong>Beach strawberries</strong> (Fragaria chiloensis) can be found along the upper edges of beaches on Washington and Oregon coasts. The leaves are thick and leathery compared to those of other wild strawberries of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
  
  <p>The other two strawberries in the region are usually found from the interior valleys west of the Cascades to alpine areas throughout the region. <strong>Wild, or Blue-leaved strawberry</strong> (Fragaria virginiana) and <strong>Wood strawberry</strong> (Fragaria vesca) are very similar in their leaves, flowers and fruit. They are found growing along the edges of clearing in woods, and often on rocky, warm south-facing slopes. The bright red fruit of our wild strawberries is quite delicious and very similar in appearance to domestic strawberries except for size, but the flavors of the native strawberries are quite different and special. The berries are found in greatest quantities May-June, depending on location. - <a href=""https://foreststewardshipnotes.wordpress.com/2014/05/28/three-wild-strawberries-of-the-pacific-northwest/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Three Wild Strawberries of the Pacific Northwest</a></p>

","<p>If you don't have a compass or other instruments, it is possible to measure the slope with your two (ski) poles solely.</p>

<p>Just hold one pole vertically by using gravity and stick it into the snow. Hold the other one horizontally until it reaches the slope with one end and the first pole with the other end. Now you check the height in which the poles contact each other. If it is at the top of the first pole, your slope is 45°, if it is approx. in the half of the first pole size, you are facing a 30° slope.</p>

If you use a GPS-compatible PLB, you can deliver your GPS coordinates very quickly without having to wait for the satellites to determine your position.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Assuming you are in a location where the signal can be picked up by a satellite &ndash; which they almost always can be &ndash; the AFRCC will receive your call almost immediately. Most PLBs these days are GPS-integrated. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you use a PLB with a GPS interface, the 406 MHz signal will guide rescuers to an area less than 100 meters from your position. At the same time, they will employ a tracking device to home in on the 121.5 MHz frequency put out by the PLB. When using a GPS-compatible PLB in the continental U.S, it takes only 5 minutes to alert search-and- rescue personnel of your position</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, it takes about <strong>5 minutes</strong> with a <strong>PLB</strong> for the AFRCC to determine your location. </p>

<h2>Commercial Satellite Based Systems</h2>

<p>There are various commercial emergency beacons, like your SPOT Messenger, which use privately owned satellites to relay emergency messages or other messages. They usually require an annual subscription, whereas PLBs only have the up-front purchase cost. SPOT and many other companies use the GEOS International Emergency Rescue Coordination Center (IERCC) which is based in Houston, Tx. According to SPOT's info pages: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Once activated, SPOT will acquire its exact coordinates from the GPS network, and send that location along with a distress message to the GEOS International Emergency Response Center every five minutes until cancelled or until the batteries are depleted. The Emergency Response Center notifies the appropriate emergency responders based on your GPS location and personal information – which may include local police, highway patrol, the Coast Guard, our country’s embassy or consulate, or other emergency search and rescue teams – as well as notifying your emergency contacts about the receipt of a distress signal.</p>
  
  <p>The IERCC is manned 24/7 with dedicated and highly trained operatives who have access to emergency responders worldwide to ensure that in an emergency your situation will be dealt with efficiently and you will receive the resources you need. In fact, the average response time from the receipt of your 911/SOS message until referring an emergency responder is only 11 minutes, wherever you are in the world. </p>
  
  <p>Once a SOS/911 message has been received, the IERCC calls your emergency contact(s) to make sure that it wasn't a false alarm. They locate and notify an emergency responder, and then maintain an open line of communication, including providing updates of your location if needed. The IERCC will also keep your emergency contact(s) informed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The response speed of the GEOS IERCC is going to depend on how well-connected they are with emergency responders in your area, but it looks like it takes about <strong>11 minutes</strong> for SPOT's service to determine your location and contact the authorities. </p>

<h1>Once ""The Authorities"" have been notified</h1>

<p>Once they have been alerted, the time for rescue crews to actually show up is going to be dependent on many factors, including: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>How easy it is to contact the appropriate SAR agency in your area, and how many levels of communication it takes to get there. For example, in a national park it's pretty easy for the AFRCC or IERCC to contact the park dispatch and initiate a SAR response. In more remote areas it may take time to contact an agency like the local Sheriff office, the National Guard, or some other agency. </p></li>
<li><p>How long it takes a SAR team to initiate a response after being notified. Most Coast Guard air stations and some Air Force helicopter SAR units maintain a 24 hour alert posture, with a crew able to depart within 15-30 minutes of receiving a call. Most National Guard units provide 24-hour response but may have to call crews from home during off-hours, and can have anywhere from a 15 minute to a 1 hour time from receiving a call to a helicopter lifting off. </p>

<p>Ground-based SAR teams which are not on 24-hour standby often take a long time to assemble, especially volunteer teams. While a first responder, such as a Sheriff SAR deputy or an NPS rescue ranger may be able to respond quickly, a fully-assembled team capable of performing technical rescue or a litter evacuation commonly takes several hours to assemble personnel and equipment.</p></li>
<li><p>How long it takes for a SAR team to reach the area. This depends on where the nearest SAR resources are and their availability. In the Sierras and Rockies you might see a helicopter within a matter of hours, if weather allows and resources are available. In a remote part of Alaska it may take a day for a plane to do a fly-by and assess the accessibility of the location.</p></li>
<li><p>How long it takes a SAR team to actually find you. These devices transmit a homing signal as mentioned above, and with GPS they'll already have a pretty good idea. If there's dense tree cover or poor visibility though, it may take time for a crew to actually locate your exact position. </p></li>
<li><p>Once they reach you, the time for a rescue to take place. Helicopters can't land everywhere, and ground teams can take a long time to arrive. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>With either a PLB or a commercial device, the response time is going to mostly be a factor of your location, not the signal getting out. The signal will be located quickly, but rescue crews may take minutes to hours to arrive depending on the situation. </p>

<h1>Making yourself easy to find</h1>

<p>If you have a GPS-based device, rescue crews should be able to locate you to within &plusmn;100m, so you don't generally need a long-distance signal like a smoke column. Making a fire (if conditions are appropriate and safe to do so) can help especially at night. A signaling mirror is very helpful in daylight for catching a pilot's attention. Place yourself in a wide open area if possible. At night you can use a flashlight to get the attention of helicopters once you hear them nearby. Once you've been noticed, don't shine the flashlight directly at the cockpit as pilots will be using night-vision goggles and could be blinded. Large areas of unnatural colors, such as a bright tarp or tent, can also help you to stand out. </p>

"Where in New Zealand is wild camping permitted?","1367","","<p>Basically <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/q/96/2106"">this</a> question, only for New Zealand (both islands).</p>

<p>I know that the <a href=""http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2011/0061/latest/DLM3742815.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Freedom Camping Act</a> exists, which basically allows camping <a href=""http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2011/0061/latest/DLM3742861.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">everywhere</a> unless it's forbidden.</p>

<p>So, where is it actually forbidden? Is there a list? Or are local municipalities not making use of this possibility to restrict wild camping? </p>

<p>By camping I mean using a tent in combination with a non-motorized vehicle like a bicycle or legs. I understand that RV's/campers might have different rules. </p>
","<p>Generally, places where it is forbidden there is good signage, or it is a place where it is not surprising to be forbidden.</p>

<p>Generally, it seemed that random stretches of highway would be posted, but just a mile or two down the road would be a spectacular place to pull over and hang out.</p>

<p>Additionally, many parks have areas in which camping is prohibited or restricted, but there would invariably be plenty of other places in which to camp, so it was never a big surprise. The NZ <a href=""http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-stay/freedom-camping/prohibited-conservation-areas/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Dept. of Conservation</a> website has a pretty good listing of where camping is prohibited or restricted. Many of the popular areas mandate staying at the huts, others are pretty relaxed, the DoC site will indicate which is which.</p>

<p>Overall, New Zealand is a pretty awesome place and if you just freestyle it, plan on free-camping but do no detailed planning, you won't have any problems. Rent one of those campervans or RVs and you'll have a blast.</p>

"Rappelling from tree","1365","","<p>My friend and I were on a tough sport climb and couldn't make it to the chains.  Thus, we had one quickdraw still on a bolt and we didn't want to leave this behind, (a quickdraw on this same project had been stolen only 2 days prior when I left it the first time)</p>

<p>We decided to hike up and around the cliff and decided it was much too difficult to try and reach the chains from down climbing the cliff.</p>

<p>We saw a big tree (definitely thicker than my whole body and alive, the trunk I could barely give it a hug and connect my hands, I'd say) and didn't want to hike back down the cliff after rappelling.  Thus we had our rope go around the tree equalizing the lengths of the rope and threw the rope off until we could see both ends hitting the ground.  </p>

<p>We didn't wrap around the tree at all so we could pull the rope down at the end.  </p>

<p>Was this safe?</p>
","<p>Short answer: If the tree is a living and thick one, then it was OK.</p>

<p>That being said, there are several reasons you should had done a proper anchor with multiple points (trees, in this case) and equalized, and then walked back again to the top.</p>

<p><strong>One simple drawback of your approach is, that the friction between the rope and the tree trunk, when you recall the rope after the rappel, can be harsh to the rope sheath and abrade it. And your rope costed more than the quickdraw you wanted to recover</strong>. It would unlikely cut it (and you would already on the ground anyways) but would it be worthy to damage the sheath of your expensive rope?</p>

<p>Also you could, although unlikely, misjudge the solidness of that single tree. Having <em>two</em> points (trees) is of course going to be better, since we're talking about <em>something you're about to hang your life from</em>.</p>

<p>That being said, what we usually do here in the Alps (where is most of the time, if not always, impossible to reach the top of the crag by other means than climbing) is to leave behind a <a href=""http://www.peguet.fr/applications/ppe-climbing-and-mountaineering"" rel=""noreferrer"">maillon rapide</a> in place of the quickdraw when this situation happens.

"Dry Douglas Fir wood only creates smoke and no fire?","1355","","<p>I cut down a Douglas Fir tree last year around June and we've dried it outside with tarp on top.</p>

<p>I live in Seattle where it constantly rains.</p>

<p>A couple of days ago I tried to use some of the wood in my outdoor firepit using Duraflame firestarter and it created a lot of smoke and not a lot of fire.</p>

<p>I tried couple more times with different pieces but still the same result?</p>

<p>I bought  <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00275F5O2"" rel=""noreferrer"">wood moisture reader</a> and it reads 10~16% in the middle of the woood. I don't understand why there is too much smoke and not a real fire when I think the wood is sufficiently dry. </p>

<p>How dry should a firewood be for ideal burn?</p>
","<p>From the moisture content of the wood it is certainly dry enough to have a good fire. I would suggest that you don't have enough heat to fully ignite the gases.</p>

<p>Wood burns through a process called <em>pyrolysis</em> where heat first breaks down the solid into flammable gases, which if there is enough heat will ignite and start a chain reaction. As the flammable gases burn, more heat is generated, so pyrolysis speeds up, more flammable gases, more heat and so on, until there is no more wood to pyrolyse. </p>

<p>If, as the flammable gases are driven off, there is not enough heat for them to ignite, then they will just rise off within the smoke. Smoke is essentially a mixture of unburnt flammable gases, partially burnt gases, and steam. </p>

<p>It sounds as if you may be trying to start your fire with sections of wood that are too large, so the surface area of the wood is small compared to the volume. So the heat is enough to start pyrolysis, but dissipates too quickly for the gases to spontaneously combust.</p>

<p>You need to start your fire off with very small bits of wood, dry grass, twigs and progressively build up the fire with larger and larger bits of wood. You need to get a good hot base to your fire before putting on large pieces. </p>

<p>This is the classic fire triangle that show that you need all three, oxygen, heat and fuel for a fire:</p>

"How do I recognise quicksand and how do I get out if stuck?","1355","","<p>This year, a Danish citizen went missing without a trace in the mountains of northern Sweden. It is not the first time; in total, ten people are registered as missing after venturing into the mountains of the Swedish county of Norrbotten, including two this year (a Polish citizen in May, and a Danish one in August). <a href=""http://www.nsd.se/nyheter/gallivare/artikel.aspx?ArticleId=7193216"">This Swedish language article</a> describes the story of several of them.</p>

<p>One is the story of two Polish citizens in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarek_National_Park"">Sarek National Park</a>, who went missing in the 1990s. One of the less esoteric theories is that they may have disappeared into <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksand"">quicksand</a>. The local <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sami_people"">Sami</a> inhabitants know about quicksand in the area, as it occasionally kills some of their reindeer. Quicksand might have killed one or more of the missing people — but it is far from certain.</p>

<p>Suppose I am hiking by myself in a remote wilderness. How can I minimise the risks of disappearing into quicksand? Can I somehow recognise quicksand in order to avoid it? If I don't recognise it and do get stuck, what can I do to get out?</p>

<p>Fortunately, the risk is probably very small, isn't it?</p>
","<p>Hartley's answer on the <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/q/107/66"">'starts sinking'</a> question linked to by @berry120 has the usual guidance for quicksand as well as general boggy/marshy ground.</p>

<p>If you are on your own, though, the key thing is to get your rucksack off and get yourself horizontal quickly. If you are vertical, and sinking, gravity will pull you down into the quicksand, but as the human body is less dense than a sand/water mix you will float at or on the surface.</p>

<p>If you struggle, you are acting against high viscosity, and possibly a vacuum as you try to pull your legs out of the quicksand, but if you can relax and lie back you will float to the surface and be able to paddle your way back to safety.</p>

<p>So - if you feel yourself stuck in quicksand - get your pack off and placed/thrown to your side and back, then try and lie down on the surface of the quicksand and relax.</p>

<p>Subsequent to getting out, you will need to retrieve your pack, so keeping a length of rope or cord on you is a good plan. (I especially like the <a href=""http://www.instructables.com/id/Paracord-bracelet-with-a-side-release-buckle/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">para cord bracelets</a>)
Depending on conditions, you may now need to get warm and dry, so plan for setting camp.</p>

<p>As for your last query - the risk is pretty low. If you feel boggy ground, you can often just fall back and be on solid ground. You'd also have to try pretty hard to end up under the surface.</p>

"How much flotation does a canoe need?","1348","","<p>Yesterday for the first time I turned my canoe over, then I <strong>tried</strong> to get back in it.  I have been thinking about adding a <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/9362/outrigger-and-or-leeboard-when-sailing-a-canoe"">sail to my canoe</a> and now that I know a bit about sailing, I know I need to plan on being able to right the sailing canoe and get back in it.  So I took the canoe to the lake to practice self recovery (solo) with just an empty canoe.</p>

<p>I have a 17 foot two person plastic canoe <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/9256/how-to-tow-a-canoe-with-a-bicycle"">as seen in my answers to this question</a> it has built in flotation at both ends. With the canoe empty, just me in a life jacket and a wood paddle.  It turns out will float the canoe <em>just barely</em> if the canoe is full of water it floats until I get in. The flotation will not support me and the canoe, I was sitting in the canoe floating by my life jacket with the canoe 2 feet under the surface.  When I get out  it surfaces with the sides just breaking the surface.  </p>

<p>There is a cool video of a guy doing solo recovery <a href=""http://www.solwaydory.co.uk/videos/19"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">at Solway Dory</a>, but he is in a smaller lighter canoe, I think he is wearing a dry suit, and he has added side flotation. I watched that video before going to the lake to try it myself.</p>

<p>Real life me and my canoe (big &amp; heavy). I can't throw it and have it land empty! (no surprise) Best I can do is turn it over slowly which results in it being half full of water when right side up.  I was not able to get back in without filling it the rest of the way with water. </p>

<p>Later I took the canoe to shore emptied it and a couple of attempts to get back in the canoe when it did not have water in it.  By this point I was tired, and could not make it happen.  I know it is possible, but it is difficult, if I could not do it in warm water while a bit tired, I don't want to bet my life on it in other scenarios. In sailing class I was easy able to get in a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunfish_(sailboat)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sunfish</a> without difficult, but that is a very different boat. </p>

<p>When people take canoes white water rafting they add <strong>A LOT</strong> of flotation (image below), essentially the canoe is all flotation except room for one person.  At that point you might as well get a kayak, what is the point of the canoe? All it holds is you and flotation. </p>

<p>So I want to add some flotation, at least enough so that I can get in over the side as long as I have enough strength to turn it back over.

I don't want to fill it with float bags.  The point of a canoe is that you can put a lot in it.</p>

<p>How do I decide out how much flotation I need, and where it needs to be? </p>

","<p>In most situations you should be prepared for a dunking, so you could hang around in the water and bail without getting too cold.  Of course, if you're in danger (e.g. from hitting rocks) get yourself to safety with a swim line to the boat and recover it by swinging it into an eddy. If you're touring (including, even especially white water touring) all your gear should be packed in suitable containers (barrels/drybags) <em>that float</em> and are lashed into place -- thus your cargo adds bouyancy, though potentially not much.  In the case of the bike, of course it's a deadweight and an encumbrance when trying to right the boat, so you'd actually need more bouyancy to counterract that.</p>

<p>There are big differences between the boat in your picture and a kayak:</p>

<ul>
<li>You'd fall out of the canoe if you capsized</li>
<li>You can move around much more for balance (and may have to)</li>
<li>You can get in and out more quickly</li>
<li>Rigging and stowing a sail are much easier and much more stable on the canoe.</li>
<li>The canoe is less manoeuvrable than the kayak</li>
<li>You can carry a bike in a canoe!</li>

"Can I expect to visit Camp 1 and beyond on an Everest base camp expedition?","1347","","<p>I am planning to do a 16 day ""standard"" Everest base camp trek in Nepal coming September.</p>

<p>Can I expect to visit Camp 1 (or even beyond?) as well or is this completely off limits for casual tourists?</p>

<p>I read that, summit expeditions will stay at base camp for weeks, in order to acclimatize for the summit.</p>

<p>How much acclimatization would it take if I want to only visit camp 1 for example?</p>
","<p>No one is allowed to just show up at base camp and expect to be able to advance to any of the other camps. </p>

<p>First of all, there is a lot of paperwork that must be completed before you're even granted a permit to climb Everest, which includes a letter of recommendation from a national climbing association. The permit to basecamp is only $50.00, but if you want to go any further, then you need to purchase an $11,000.00 permit. If you get caught above basecamp without a permit, the fine is $22,000.00, and you might even get jail time on top of that.</p>

<p>Second, the route from basecamp to camp 1 is the traverse through the Khumbu Icefall, which isn't just a walk in the park. It's a treacherous traverse over deep crevasses and under looming seracs, which requires the use of ice axes and crampons, and the only way through is over ladder bridges and with the use of fixed ropes. Navigating the Khumbu Icefall is a little more technical now than it has been in past years, because they changed the route in order to avoid the danger of avalanches. Many people have died on Everest between basecamp and camp 1 by being swept off by an avalanche into a crevasse.  </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AWgAY.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AWgAY.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>  </p>

<p>Expeditions pay big money to have all those ladders and ropes packed all the way up to Everest, and to have experienced Sherpas fix them along the best route, which changes every year as the ice continuously moves and changes form. They aren't going to simply let you make use of their equipment. One of the biggest hurdles on Everest is getting around all the officials who want a piece of the tourism revenue pie. Tourism is number one industry in Nepal, and climbing in the Himalayas represents a large portion of that industry.</p>

<p>If you want to check out any of the camps above base camp, you're going to have to bring some deep pockets with you. I'm not going to say it's not possible, but if it is, it's <em>not</em> going to be cheap.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Edit</h2>

<p>After finding a <a href=""http://www.snowyhorizon.com/mountaineering/climbing-permit.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">fee schedule</a>, it looks like the $11,000.00 fee is only for Everest Summit bids in Spring. In Autumn it appears you could go as high as Camp III for only $900.00 if you purchase a <strong>Lhotse</strong> summit permit (Lhotse is the peak right beside Everest, you climb the Lhotse Ice Face to get to Camp III, then head South up to the Summit of Everest, or North to the Summit of Lhotse). </p>

<p>Either way, you're going to need a permit, and likely a guide. Your best course of action is to hook up with a expedition like the one linked above. Expeditions help you cut through all the bureaucracy by dealing with all the government officials on your behalf. It's still going to cost you something though, and you're going to need to buy all your gear, which you may want to do in Nepal, I've heard you can get great deals on stuff if you buy it there as lots of climbers leave their used gear behind after their once in a lifetime summit attempt.  </p>

"How would I find a hot spring?","1346","","<p>I've been looking at a map of the hot springs in my state, and near my area there are 4 in a 60 mile range. These hot springs all are lined up in a straight line, and so my incredibly wishful thinking is that there is another undiscovered (or at least, secret) hot spring somewhere along that line. I will live there next summer, so I'll get plenty of chances to go hiking and exploring the area. If such a treasure does indeed exist, how can I maximize my chances of finding it?</p>
","<p>It helps to know what is going on <em>underground</em> when looking for geological patters. Hot springs are of course geothermally heated by pockets of magma in the crust that are relatively close to the surface. Understanding the underlaying strata and ground water patters are essential to accurately predicting where hydraulic phenomena will appear. At the very least you need a stratigraphic map so you can examine fault structures and determine where layers of porous rock intersect with faults, the surface, and also where aquatards may inhibit ground water flow. </p>

<p>As others have already indicated here, the fact that the hot springs you are observing are in a line suggests that they are over a fault line, likely an area of tectonic uplift. If you were to examine the stratigraphy of the areas where the known hot springs are, you could identify which layers of strata the heated groundwater is permeating to the surface from, and then locate other areas along that line where those same layers intersect with the surface again.</p>

<p>I'll confess that reading a stratiographic map isn't that easy, but if you can even get a vague idea of where you might suspect undiscovered springs will appear based on the geology and geography, it will greatly reduce your search area.</p>

<p>Without conducting a geological survey with a team of geologists, the next best thing to do is to go bush whackin' away from the beaten trail, using the suggestions that @Sherwood gave you in their answer. An IR thermal imager would be handy to bring along with you, you can get relatively affordable ones that <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00K0PXFB6"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">attach to your iPhone</a>. </p>

<p>It's no simple task to actually go out and find natural resources. Which is the number one reason why geologists are able to get jobs other than just teaching... Most of the time when people stumble onto hot-springs it's because they're looking for something else. Lots of springs are discovered by hunters and trappers this way. </p>

<p>Good luck finding your personal secret hotspring, I'm sure you'll have fun exploring the untamed bush whether you find one or not.</p>

<p>AND if you want to get real fancy get a Vapour Barrier Liner and use all three together for expeditions and temps below -30C.  You now have all your bases covered! </p>

<p>This is much more cost effective than to buy a summer bag, your -15 bag, and an expedition bag...</p>

<p>If you're too cold in the overbag but too hot in the -15C mummy bag, try playing with your layers, add a base layer top and bottom while in the overbag, or even throw on a nano puff or fleece top...there are many ways to regulate your body temp.  Vests are a great way to keep your core warm but your arms still feel nice and cool.</p>

","<p>Coconut opening comes in two parts, neither of which needs a knife.</p>

<p>First, the husk. Get a reasonably sturdy pointed stick and put it in the ground, point up, between your feet. Jam the coconut down onto the stick, hitting off centre. This should wedge off bits of husk. Repeat until the husk is all off. A very green coconut is harder to ""peel"" this way, but without a knife, this is basically the option you have.</p>

<p>If getting all the liquid out is important, and you have no bowl or bucket, pause here, find a stick or stone, and poke at the eyes until you break through one or two of them, and drink the liquid through the hole. A hollow piece of grass or reed might make a useful straw.</p>

<p>Once you have exposed the inner coconut, find the three ""eyes"" on it. Hold the coconut so that it vaguely looks like a face - the three circles on a side of it, two above one. Hit it <strong>hard</strong> with a stick or a rock on the ""top of its head"" and it should break in half. You can now continue to break it up to separate shell from meat, or you can scrape out juicy meat with your same pointed stick and eat it as you go.</p>

"Preparing rice and mashed potatoes with warm instead of cooking water","1334","","<p>For a one week trip in a dry region I need to conserve water and weight. My idea is to bring precooked ""instant rice"" and pulverulent mashed potatoes. I´d warm a bit of water to about 40 - 50° C and mix it with the rice or mash. Would that resemble anything edible? (I'll try at home and post the results, but hope for some thoughts and input.)</p>

<p>The benefits:
I don´t need the power to cook a liter, warming a quarter will do. That`s 1/10 of enery and 1/4 of water for every meal. Instead of using a full fledged gas cooking device, I can bring some Esbit. For each 3 day-intervall of water self-suffiency, that saves 5 kg. <strong>What are possible downsides?</strong></p>

<p>EDIT: I have been unclear about the pre-cooked rice. I mean the vacuum-packed, non-dehydrated rice they sell it in grocery stores. Usualy you´d just warm it up for 2 minutes in a microwave oven, and that´s it. But I am not sure if the warming up is for safety or taste reasons.</p>
","<p>Keep in mind that any water you are cooking with is still liquids you are intaking. A pantry full of dehydrated food is an awesome weightsaver in places were you always have water available but in a dry place you need to carry it with you.
Efficiency-wise, I personally found the scout kelly-kettle type stoves ( kelly kettle + pot on top) great for boiling water while cooking another at the same time in the pot on top of the kettle, not much fuel needed. And one way to conserve the water is to rinse the cup you ate in and drink it before washing it </p>

<p>If you were to use the precooked rice with warm water it takes about half hour to bring it back and you still should bring it to a boil after. I know of people that just soak it for a long time and eat it as it is but I think they must be crazy.</p>

<p>Since from your question it seems you think you cook rice boiling, draining and throwing the water out, be aware that many kinds of rice don't work that way.
If you take uncooked Jasmine rice, for example, the ratio is 1 part rice and 1 1/2 part water and all the water is absorbed by the rice (so way less than a liter, 250 ml of water will be even too much for one person). Forget Arborio or similar as they take long time to cook. Precooked rice works the same as it will absorb the water and at 1 to 1 ratio usually and faster cooking. You might want to redo your calculations then and probably find out you can expend the fuel to bring the water to a boil ;). Also Dhara gave you an excellent suggestion in the comments as there are recipes for eating the flakes raw it seems.</p>

<p>Then, if what you mean is the ready to eat kind that comes in a bowl or similar to cook in a microwave or stovetop, that usually involves boiling the unopened container in water for more than just a few minutes. I suppose you could reuse the same water over and over as Aravona mentioned in the comments but then that stuff needs to be in the water at high temperature and for a certain amount of time to heat up or its like you didn't heat it at all. Its not the best option as weight saver, or the cheapest IMHO and with those you better stick to the cooking instructions.</p>

<p>Also consider couscous, it cooks really fast, or thin rice noodles.</p>

<p>For the instant mash potatoes in powder those can be made with cold water, you have to get the worst kind that have only powder with no flakes. The powdered stuff is not that great so you might want to give it a try at home (on a trail all the food is ok even if disappointing at home) and maybe add some milk powder, gravy powder and butter powder (if you can find it) and some spices to turn them from barely edible to barely passable.</p>

<p>I dont know your tastes in food but going with all the normal grocery store instant foods the more spices you have at hand the better because they tend to be very bland.
Also remember to keep an eye on proteins, as you will have to add those too and keep in mind that instant food has less nutrition than what you would have cooking it yourself from raw.</p>

<p>Or you can go the MRE way, those with the self heating chemical pack, the only water needed in those is the one for the chemical reaction, you dont drink it, dont keep it and its not in direct contact with food so can be any water you find. They are not cheap if you dont have a ""direct source"" and for a whole week it will be sad but covering 2 or 3 days with those might mean the weight savings you want. Or FSR for extremes, but only if you plan to be too tired to be thinking about how sad is the meal you are eating ;)</p>

<p>With a diet of instant rice and instant potatoes (and the military stuff) for a week you better bring some form of fiber supplements or you will cut down on bathroom breaks quite a bit ;).</p>

","<p>Bear canisters should <strong>not</strong> be suspended.</p>

<p>Doing so would make it possible for a bear to steal the canister and take it away. The shape of the canisters make it very challenging for a bear to hold or carry, and normally they will eventually give up and ditch the canister somewhere still close enough that you could find and retrieve it. If you have it hung, and the bear manages to snag it down, it could hold the rope in its teeth and haul it away never to be seen again. </p>

<p>The same concern should also be for placing the canister near water, where it could float away never to be retrieved.</p>

<p>You should leave your bear canister on the ground, at least 100 feet from your campsite. I typically bury mine somewhat beneath loose rocks or logs to make it more of a hassle for any critter to get to. Make it difficult for the canister to be accessed and inadvertently rolled very far away.</p>

"Does ""Sport Climbing"" refer to bolted climbing outdoors only or both indoors and outdoors","1330","","<p>I was having a debate with my friend on the definition of ""Sport Climbing"". We both agree it means rock climbing with no pre-setup ropes on a bolted route. </p>

<p>I think regardless of whether this route is in an indoor gym or at a real rock outdoors it's all called sport climbing. However, my friend thinks it's only called sport climbing if it's at a real rock outdoors. He called it ""indoor lead climbing"" if it's in an indoor gym. But I think lead climbing has a broader meaning, it includes both sport climbing and trad climbing and it's also mentioned in this question: </p>

<p><a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/a/4639/14028"">What's the difference between Sport Climbing and Traditional Climbing</a>.</p>

<p>Am I correct?</p>
","<p>You (arguably) are right. I would even approach it the other way around: Should there be another description for outdoor lead climbing on bolted routes.</p>

<p>""Proof"": Climbing on artificial holds has become a pretty huge competitive sport. The main international association for this sport is called IFSC: ""International Federation of Sport Climbing"". As it's events are pretty well attended you can't really argue this is an abuse of the term (or if you do, you have to accept the abuse is commonplace).</p>

<p>In my opinion the reason why there is no distinction and both climbing on natural rock and artificial holds is called sport climbing is in its development. Originally climbing on artificial holds was a mere means of training, nowadays there is a huge amount of climbers that hardly ever touches natural rock. It has become a sport of its own.</p>

<p>In my opinion it would totally make sense to use ""sports climbing"" for climbing on artificial holds and ""rock climbing"" for climbing on real rock. What certainly is inconsistent is to call it ""indoor"" something, because you also have artificial climbing walls outdoors.</p>

"Abseiling on one rope: should I attach the prusik to the other one?","1328","","<p>We were abseiling into a cave (about 15 metres height) using a rope hanged by its middle from an anchor:</p>

<pre><code> _
/o\
| |

| |
| |
| |
</code></pre>

<p>My experience on abseiling is mostly from climbing, where I descend on both strands. But my friend said that one should do it on one strand (it's understandable because it was a very stiff static rope). So we made a knot on the rope. Then she connected to one strand, leaving the other completely free, and descended. </p>

<p>Later, someone else told me that one should connect the descending device to one strand, and the prusik to the other.</p>

<p>So, my question is: should one connect the prusik to the same or the other strand, and why?</p>

<p>Also: if using two different strands, should one also tie a knot on the rope?</p>

<p>(side note: we used the setup with one free strand to practice building a hauling system. It was very easy to retrieve the free strand for that purpose. Is this a significant consideration when deciding how to connect the prusik?)</p>
","<p>Pulling down ropes after abseiling in caving is common here in the UK, where a cave has an upper and a lower entrance with one or more pitches in between. We use Static rope and caving descenders are usually designed to only use a single strand of rope.</p>

<p>We double the rope and tie a knot with a small loop near the middle of the rope. Then feed one end of the rope through the anchor (usually a bolt and hanger of some kind) so that the two sides of the rope are parallel as in your diagram, with the knot and loop near the anchor.</p>

<p>Then we clip a carabiner to the loop formed by the knot and clip this carabiner to the other side of the rope.</p>

<p>The next step is than to abseil down using the end of the rope passing through the carabiner (the side without the knot). This causes the rope to pull through the carabiner and tighten around the anchor.</p>

<p>When the last person is down, you pull down the rope using the other side of the rope from which was abseiled down (the side with the knot and loop) and continue on your way.
Obviously you need to take extreme care and not abseil on the wrong side of the rope. This can be mitigated against by clipping the carabiner to the anchor until the last person is on the rope and ready to abseil. They double check they have attached their descender to the correct side of the rope and then unclip the carabiner from the anchor and abseil down. Also you can coil the ""pull-down"" side of the rope and keep it at the top if the pitch until the last person is ready to abseil and lowers this end down, in order to prevent someone attaching to the wrong side of the rope.</p>

","<p>There's no simple answer to this question - everybody has their own preferences. (That being said, I'm a big fan of my straight edge <strong>SOG SEAL Pup Elite</strong> and would <em>highly</em> recommend it). There are a few simple guidelines, though.</p>

<p>I'd suggest something with a (1) <strong>thick full-tang blade</strong>, so you could chop down some small trees if needed. But (2) <strong>not too big</strong>, so it's still comfortable for carving fire spindles and whatnot.

Serrated blade is also not very easy to sharpen.</p>

"Arm compression sleeves for climbing","1326","","<p>A lot of runners use calf and leg compression sleeves, as these are supposed to improve blood flow. It would seem a logical extension to use compression sleeves on your forearms during climbing, especially on pumpy routes. Are there anecdotal or actual studies on the effectiveness of forearm compression sleeves for climbing? </p>
","<p>Part of the reason you get pumped out while climbing is because your arms are up over our head. Compression sleeves work for runners because the <a href=""http://www.fleetfeethartford.com/sports-medicine/sports-medicine-corner/compression"" rel=""nofollow"">gradient compression</a> helps the blood in their legs flow back up to their hearts against gravity (they give extra elasticity to the veins which are superficial[<em>nearer to the surface of the skin</em>] to your muscles). Running is also an aerobic exercise, their heart rate is higher which enables them to clear away lactate more effectively. Climbing is more of an anaerobic exercise, the lower heart rate and elevation of the limbs makes it more difficult to clear the lactate. The problem in climbing isn't getting blood back to the heart, it's getting new blood up into your arms against gravity. Compression sleeves would do little if nothing at all to aid your more profound[<em>deeper in your body</em>] arteries. I imagine compression sleeves would only aggravate the buildup of lactic acid in your arms while climbing. The most effective way to control blood flow on a climb is to control your breathing, the more you breath, the more your heart pumps. That's probably why the best climbers in the world are also some of the loudest. </p>

<p>There are <a href=""http://www.climbing.com/gear/110-alchemy-arm-sleeves/"" rel=""nofollow"">compression sleeves for climbers</a>, but they're for recovering <em>after</em> a climb, they're not meant to be worn while climbing, and don't prevent arm pump.</p>

  <p>How would you do this safely (is this even possible to do safely)?</p>

<p>This technique is based on one member of the party being more competent than the others and the grades being very low (probably nothing more than a Grade III scramble)</p>

<p>For example I lead a <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/6682/leading-an-inexperienced-group"">group of friends up Tryfan</a>. This is a grade I scramble. I took a rope. I was confident soloing any climbing sections (this is well below my climbing grade) and I used the rope to help the less experienced members. </p>

<p>I didn't use a ""handline"" (something for people to hold onto is of limited use as if someone falls it's not really going to help) </p>

<p>If there isn't a member of the party who is competent enough to solo the climb then your right, your into the realm of ""technical"" climbing. </p>

<h2>Grade I or below</h2>

<p>Most Grade I scrambles are within the range of anyone who is competent in the mountains. Above this you need more skills. If your not confident to lead a Grade I then your not confident to be doing this at all. Get some more experience then come back.</p>

<h2>Grade II/III and climbing</h2>

<p>This isn't totally inaccessible you just need take a bit of time to learn scrambling rope techniques, how to belay, etc. you can still do this. You will likely need some more kit and you will need to learn how to use it (i.e. harnesses and belay plates and some kind of protection such as nuts). Your local climbing wall is probably where you start with this, most have beginner courses that will teach your how to belay, etc. You then need to learn to place the gear and protect the climb. But scrambling is a really good place to learn to climb and improve your confidence. <strong>But learn the basics somewhere safe (indoors) first!</strong></p>

<p>This isn't a technique I'm familiar with, plus I don't really see the benefit. If someone isn't confident they either shouldn't be there at all or should be properly secured for their safety. Couple of issues here:</p>

<ul>
<li>A rope is really unpleasant to hold.</li>
<li>If you fall and hold the rope, expect serious burns.</li>
<li>If you fall what are the chances of you catching the rope?</li>

<p>for that reason I'd prefer to use a different technique:</p>

<p>I used a <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/a/7428/2766"">figure of eight lasso</a>(passed under the armpits of the person) to secure the people and I either belayed off spikes or <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/a/7246/2766"">hip belayed</a>. The rope's main job was to give the person confidence, but in the unlikely event that they do fall, I could catch them without relaying on them holding onto something.

","<p>Compared to a 'lake' kayak, it will be hard for a novice to paddle in a straight line, and is not efficient (i.e. slower)) paddling in a straight line, so for day tours is less than ideal.

<p>As far as straight line paddling and control, I was taught to paddle in a white water boat similar to this (A Dancer, mid 1980's) with a skeg that slide over the rear.

<p>There's also a German <a href=""http://www.wandern-saechsische-schweiz.de/Liste_Boofen.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">website that lists all ""boofen""</a> with GPS coordinates. But even with those it can be a bit of a challenge to find them, because the paths leading to them are often not labelled, blocked or marked to be for climbers. Try to acquire a map made by Dr.-Ing. Rolf Böhm which is a beautiful map of the Elbsandsteingebirge that shows many of the paths and rock formations in great detail, which is helpful because a GPS distance only a few meters away might mean that it's actually 30m higher and getting to this location might only be possible with a long detour around the mountain.</p>

<p>It should go without saying but <strong>don't make a fire</strong>. Leave the place tidy.</p>

<p>I've done it several times, also in winter. It's a great experience, especially when your boofe is higher up, so you have a great view on sunrise.</p>

<p>I'm not that well travelled (never been outside of Europe!) but at some point I'd love to head elsewhere to perhaps hike somewhere a bit more exotic.</p>

<p>I've heard (quite a bit) that most compasses only come calibrated for one hemisphere - how much ""out"" is a compass in the wrong part of the world? Is it generally no more than a few degrees, or potentially completely wildly out?</p>

<p>Following on from this, can I get a compass that <em>does</em> work pretty much worldwide to save the hassle of swapping back and forth between them, or is it just a case of always the right compass for the right place?</p>
","<p>A compass is ""accurate"" in both hemispheres in that it should still point to magnetic north. </p>

<p>But the problem is that when you're in the southern hemisphere, the magnetic north pole is sort of 'under your feet' so the compass needs to be one that's specially 'balanced' for the Southern hemisphere to ensure the needle moves smoothly and responds fast.</p>

<p>You can get compasses that are 'globally balanced' to work everywhere - the <a href=""http://www.suunto.com/gb/en/products/Fieldcompasses/suunto-m-3-global/suunto-m-3-global-cm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Suunto M3 global</a> is one.</p>

"What breed is this very large, black, turtle/tortoise found in the Northeast United States?","1318","","<p>My husband found this very large turtle (or tortoise) crossing a road from an industrial park towards a wooded area. It was in June, in Massachusetts, USA, at 8:00 in the evening. He didn't touch it, just walked alongside to make sure it crossed safely.</p>

<p>The prominent features were as follows: </p>

<ul>
<li>Very hard shell, primarily black, with some dark brown areas</li>
<li>Approximately 18 in, (45 cm) long, and 15 in (38 cm) wide, not including head or tail</li>
<li>Tail at least 8 in (20 cm) long </li>
<li>Very wide feet with long toenails</li>
<li>Head sticking out only a few inches, although that's not an indication of neck length</li>
<li>Pointed upper part of mouth</li>
<li>Low rounded shell</li>
<li>Serrated edges, especially on back of shell</li>
<li>All body parts wrinkled and bumpy </li>
</ul>

<p>I've heard that one difference between a turtle and a tortoise is that turtles fully immerse themselves in water, whereas tortoises spend most of their time on land, and drink at the edge without swimming. I'm not sure if that's true. My husband hasn't gone into those woods, so he doesn't know whether or not there's a pond or other body of water nearby.</p>

<p>What is the breed of this gorgeous creature? Is it a turtle or a tortoise? I'd also like to know some other things, such as approximate age; preferred diet; nesting habits; best place and time of year to see them; conservation status (some turtles in Massachusetts are protected or endangered); and any other interesting characteristics.</p>

","<p>This has been rightly identified as a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_snapping_turtle"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">common snapping turtle</a>. It's not a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tortoise"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tortoise</a>. The biggest difference is that turtles are aquatic, spending most of their time in the water, while tortoises live on the land.</p>

<p>Below are the answers to a few of your other questions.</p>

<p>Age:<br>
It's not really possible to tell the age of this turtle. The breed reaches full size at between 8 and 10 years old. Adult snapping turtles usually measure from 9.5 to 14.5 inches (24 to 36 cm), with many growing much larger. Healthy snappers live an average of 40-60 years, sometimes longer. By the size criteria, the one in your pictures definitely appears to be fully grown, so it's probably somewhere between 10 and 40!</p>

<p>Diet:<br>
Snappers are omnivores, meaning they eat both animals and plants. They're pretty sedentary, and are more likely to grab than hunt. They eat insects, spiders, worms, fish, frogs, grubs, smaller breeds of turtles, and other things that swim past. When bigger they also eat snakes, birds, and small mammals. They like all types of aquatic vegetation, and there's plenty of variety in and around their home area. Plant-based foods make up about one-third of their diet when young, and they become more vegetarian as they age. </p>

<p>Nesting habits:<br>
Size, rather than age, determines the time they're mature enough to reproduce. Once they reach about 8 inches, usually around 6 years old, they begin breeding. Mating takes place in the water, after which the female travels a long distance, often more than a mile, to make the nest. The journey can take many days, and during that time she goes without water. Nests are built on land, with loose, sandy soil and hills being the preferred location. A spot in full sun gives the hatchlings the best chance of surviving. After laying 20-50 eggs, called a ""clutch"", the mother turtle covers them and returns back to her home, often stopping at a local water source along the way. If she likes the nesting spot, she'll return there for many years in a row. It's called ""nest site fidelity."" Nesting season is between April and November. Eggs incubate for two to four months, depending mostly on the weather. Sadly, very few snapper births are successful, some sources estimate as low as 1 in 100. Large numbers of eggs are eaten by birds and animals. That's one reason why so many eggs are in each clutch. Of those that survive, few hatchlings make it to adulthood. Once established, large snappers have very few animal predators. We humans are the main predator, so if they can steer clear of us, they can live a long time! (In a very unusual recent incident, two hatchling snappers were rescued from a swimming pool in Lakeville, Massachusetts. They were only 2 days old. The picture below shows a rare glimpse of these turtles at that size.) </p>

<p>Best place and time to see them:<br>
During the day, they're most often seen in the spring and the fall, traveling to and from nesting areas. Unfortunately, those sightings are usually in the road, where they're in grave danger of ""death-by-car""! In their natural habitat, they're hard to spot, as they're as dark as the murky waters in which they live. Since they're mainly nocturnal, the best time to see them moving and eating is after dark or early in the morning. They stay underwater much of the time, with just their neck and head sticking up. If you tread lightly, you may get a chance to spot one, but if you scare it, it will usually go under water and swim quickly away.</p>

<p>Conservation status:<br>
In most areas where snappers are abundant, they're not classified as endangered. Massachusetts has <a href=""http://www.mass.gov/eea/agencies/dfg/dfw/natural-heritage/species-information-and-conservation/rare-reptiles-and-amphibians/turtles-of-massachusetts.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">10 varieties</a> of turtles. Most are either endangered, threatened, or species of special concern. Common snappers are not on that list, but are protected, meaning it's illegal to hunt, capture, or remove one from its habitat. Handling is illegal too, and subject to fines, although sometimes people will do so to help them cross the road. Picking them up incorrectly is extremely dangerous to them and should always be avoided unless there's really no other choice. Special handling permits are given to certified wildlife rescuers, rehabilitators, and treatment centers. Even after dying, they're an important part of the eco-system. Removing dead body parts, including just the shells, are subject to a fine, as high as $500.00. Breeding and sales carry a hefty penalty in Massachusetts, up to $2,000.00. (They're legal to have as pets in some states, but not in Massachusetts.) </p>

<p>Some interesting facts:  </p>

<ul>
<li>The temperature at which the eggs are maintained determines the gender. Eggs maintained at 68°F produce only females; those at 70-72°F produce both male and female turtles; and those incubated at 73-75°F produce only males.</li>
<li>After mating takes place, the female can take up to two years before laying the eggs. </li>
<li>Snapping turtles have extremely good eyesight both above and under water. Because of the position of their eyes, they can even see straight above their heads. They also have excellent hearing. </li>
<li>Because of their bone structure, snapping turtles can't retract their neck all the way into their body, like most other turtles can. </li>
<li>Unlike other turtles, snappers don't bask on rocks or logs. They get the light they need by keeping their body just under the surface of the water with their head and neck out and raised toward the sun. If you think you see a snapper on a log, it's probably a different, but similar-looking, turtle. Full-grown snappers are too big for most logs anyway! </li>
<li>Snapping turtles are not as aggressive as commonly believed. They will only defend themselves if cornered, cut off from water or physically handled. They don't like confrontation, and they generally don't chase or attack people in the water. </li>
</ul>

<p>Make a layer of spruce branches ~15 cm/6 inch or more. Also, use a closed-cell foam pad plus an inflatable pad. I slept in US Army bivy sack, US Army cold-weather sleeping bag. This set-up will keep you reasonably warm. To keep you comfortably warm, sleep dressed in many layers, wear balaclava and a lot of socks, otherwise your feet will get really cold. Exercise before going to bed. You might want to put some heat packs in your socks.</p>

<p>Use a snow shovel to dig a hole for your fire about 2.5 meters/8 feet in diameter, plus a place to sit and sleep. Otherwise your fire will melt a hole and all the warmth will radiate up. </p>

<p>Bring a pee bottle. It's not fun to go in the dark cold forest and then try to get back to a cold bed.</p>

<p>Do not underestimate the amount of wood you will need and time it takes to gather it. Chop a couple of big dead trees and split a few logs to make a nice fire. Bring an axe and a foldable saw. Put a bright lanyard on every piece of equipment.</p>

<p>Also use large snow shoes, you will have to carry a lot of weight, if you don't, you will not get far. </p>

<p>Don't go alone. Bring some medical supplies to treat small wounds. If you bring alcohol, don't bother with beer, bring something stronger. Otherwise bring some hot chocolate, it is easer to clean then tea.</p>

<p>Winter camping is easy and fun once you find the way to do it.</p>

<p>These are important for snow sports, eg snowboarding in Scotland, where trousers can end up both soaking wet and covered in snow, so the weight of them is quite high. A belt lets them pull down to the hips unless pulled really tight, and the low top allows snow to go up your back. Never a good thing. With braces the top can be well above waist height, and you don't notice the weight carried on your shoulders.</p>

"Experiences hiking with a baby: diapers","1315","","<p>So, I recently posted a question on hiking with a baby - my wife and I used to hike a fair amount, and we would like to get cracking again soon, but with our 7-month daughter.
I'm currently trying to get as much info and as many do's and don'ts as possible, so today's topic: we use disposable diapers currently, and it suddenly occurred to me that our little bundle of joy is a regular production line of soiled diapers, and we would obviously need to carry them out with us. But they can get quite heavy (by the way, I'm a small guy, so I care about weight. A lot.)</p>

<p>Many trails have proper waste bins at each hut, but we often hike trails without huts, by preference.
So, any experience with this? Any suggestions? (I'm also very aware of the ecological impact of using the things at all, but that's a debate for another day...)</p>
","<p>I've carried them out, and I've burned them in the nightly fires we were having anyway. This was canoe-camping rather than hiking, so weight was less of an issue - but a weeklong trip accumulating diapers from two toddlers: smell was a problem. We used a dedicated bag for them, and kept it well away from everything else at campsites. Bags within bags within bags helped a bit too. My preference would be to burn them (start the fire while dinner is being made on a stove; once it's going deal with the diapers you've accumulated that day; after the diapers are burned put on another log and declare the fire open for sitting around) but when you're camping during a burn ban you do what you have to.</p>

"""Must Have"" in a starter Trad Rack","1314","","<p>After learning to climb indoors on top rope and learning to lead sport climbs outdoors I will be progressing into Trad climbing by taking an instruction course as well as climbing with other experienced trad climbers.  The areas being climbed are listed below in order of frequency:</p>

<ol>
<li>Rattlesnake Point/Mt. Nemo - Limestone - 2-3 times a week</li>
<li>Red River Gorge - SandStone - once every couple months</li>
<li>Sqaumish - Granite - once or twice a year</li>
</ol>

<p>My question is being a minimalist and a cost conscious individual, what would I be looking at in terms of ""must have"" on my rack for day 1.  Furthermore what would I be looking at acquiring throughout time, in what order and for what reason?</p>

<p>PS. Safety trumps minimalist and cost conscious any day so if a full set of everything is what's required to be safe then that is what will be purchased.  I also appreciate the understanding that all the protection in the world can't keep me safe if it is not used/placed correctly.</p>

<p>If further information is required please let me know.</p>
","<p>You don't need a trad rack of your own in order to follow. If you're climbing with experienced trad leaders who have their own racks, then you also don't need to bring your own rack. If you're going to lead, you just borrow their gear. In your situation, there is really no advantage to buying a lot of trad gear before you try following on trad climbs at all.</p>

<p>But anyway, to answer your question...</p>

<p>You already have a sport setup, so I'm not going to list stuff like helmet, ATC, etc., that you already have.</p>

<p>You need some passive and/or active pieces. How many and what kind are going to depend a lot on what you climb, and you will get a better idea of this once you've done some climbs and seen what fits in various situations.</p>

<p>You probably want about 10-12 alpine draws for extending your protection. Depending on the climb, it may also be possible to use quickdraws (which you presumably already own) to replace some or all of these, but quickdraws are more of a sport climbing thing, and when you take your course, they'll show you how a rigid quickdraw can pop your protection out of a crack in some situations.</p>

<p>You need materials for building anchors. 1 double-length sling, 1 quad-length sling, 4 locking biners, 10 m (30') of 14 mm (9/16"") webbing, some rap rings. Some kind of lightweight knife or scissors.</p>

<p>If you're not already familiar with safety backups for rappels, get some instruction in that, and carry whatever gear you need for the backup, e.g., a prusik.</p>

<p>It's a really good idea to carry a Texas prusik system for use in ascending the rope when you're following on a route that you can't get up.</p>

<p>Nut tool. (And if you don't have one already by the first time you go follow on a trad climb, make sure to ask your leader to lend you one before the climb.)</p>

<p>It's a good idea to at least have a pair of gloves available for when you're belaying a leader. Compared to sport climbing, there is more potential in trad for the leader to take a long fall because something went wrong (pieces pulled out, no good placements for a long stretch,...)</p>

<p>Radios can be handy for situations where communication is difficult. One of the most common causes of accidents is a miscommunication between the climber and the belayer.</p>

Normally just me and my girlfriend would do this kind of thing, I'll lead she'd second. But I'm thinking of taking another friend along this time. I'll still do all the leading with two seconds.</p>

<p>I'm unclear on techniques to belay two seconds from above though?</p>
","<p>While belaying two seconds at once using the method ShemSeger pointed out is <em>my</em> favorite, it does take a fair amount of experience so I would not recommend it to someone climbing for the first time with two seconds.</p>

<p>If you're just starting out, I recommend you use the <strong>Caterpillar technique</strong>: You lead on a single rope and belay the second as you would normally, except the second climber trails another rope behind them and clips it into each piece of gear. When the second reaches the belay, pull up the rest of the slack on the third climber's rope and put them on belay (just as you did for the second). The third climber climbs and removes the gear you placed.</p>

<p>At the belay, the second climber can help with rope management: flaking ropes so they're ready for you to lead off the next pitch, and making sure the ropes don't tangle.</p>

<p>It does have several disadvantages (mostly... it's slow), but it's extremely safe. Most importantly, it's also closest to what you are already used to doing. It's my recommendation for any first-timer party of three: you've already got enough new things going on.</p>

<p>Knees are complicated, so a medical expert will help focus on the cause and area of effect. In my case, an imbalance due to mountain biking and rock climbing meant I could bash my way up a mountain, but descent would be a painful exercise. Especially on multi-days or when cooled off. </p>

<p>My own training routine, set by a phsyiotherapist friend, introduced exercises and drills that I would either never have done, or did not think to do. These included modified squats, foam rolls, wall sits, step jumps and other exercises for stability.

"Does drinking tea cause problems at altitude?","1308","","<p>I've heard from a tour leader that you shouldn't drink tea in high altitude because it makes you thirsty and cause problem in blood circulation. Is this true? Should'nt we drink tea in high altitude?</p>
","<p>The idea that caffeinated drinks dehydrate you or ""don't count"" toward your body's water requirement is a myth. Laboratory studies have shown that caffeinated soda is just as hydrating as water, i.e., the diuretic effect of the caffeine is too small to measure.[Grandjean 2000] Even in the case of coffee, which has much higher concentrations of caffeine than soda, studies going back as far as 1928 have shown that the diuretic effect vanishes for people whose bodies have learned to tolerate the caffeine.[Eddy 1928]</p>

<p>It's extremely common for mountaineers to drink tea at high altitudes. For example, I traveled with several mountain guides in Kenya and Tanzania who drank the stuff in massive quantities. For someone who's a caffeine addict, not drinking caffeine at high altitude is a really silly thing to do. It will give you a headache and make you feel terrible -- exactly the same symptoms as mild altitude sickness.</p>

<p>Reviews of the effects of caffeine at high altitude [Hackett 2010], and specifically of tea at Everest base camp [Scott 2004], showed that there were multiple positive effects of caffeine and no detectable negative effects. The positive effects included a decrease in high-altitude lassitude, as well as an improvement in athletic performance that was bigger at high altitude than at low altitude. Dehydration is difficult to avoid at very high altitudes such as the altitude of Everest base camp; however, the Everest study showed that the hydration status of tea drinkers was the same as that of a control group who abstained from caffeine.</p>

<p>Hackett writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While symptoms of dehydration are similar to AMS, no compelling evidence suggests that dehydration contributes to AMS.</p>
  
  <p>Similar to caffeine’s successful use for headaches at low altitude, owing to its cerebral vasoconstriction properties, it is likely that caffeine will help prevent or treat altitude headaches and therefore AMS [...] </p>
  
  <p>[T]he symptoms [of caffeine withdrawal] and their timing (12 to 24 h) mimic acute mountain sickness. [...] One can only guess at how many cases of caffeine withdrawal are misdiagnosed as AMS and at what role caffeine withdrawal might play in promoting AMS.</p>

"Why are people so worried about Giardia?","1307","","<p>Everyone I have ever been camping with seems to have an unwritten rule never to drink from streams no matter how clear they might seem, for fear of Giardia. I have also heard people telling about having to go to the doctor for a pill and ""living"" on the toilet for a while.</p>

<p>Even as recent as the 1900s, people have been out exploring and drank from streams with no hesitation, but I don't hear stories about people dying (or suffering greatly) from Giardia.</p>

<p>Basically, my real question is: Have our bodies become weaker somehow? Or why is everyone so scared of it now, when no one seemed to care before?</p>
","<p>The question doesn't state what geographical area it's about, and it really isn't possible to give an answer that covers everything. In this answer, I'm only going to deal with pristine backcountry areas in North America, such as the Sierra.</p>

<p>In order to interpret the scientific evidence properly, it's necessary to understand some scientific background about Giardia and giardiasis.</p>

<p>The human gut is naturally teeming with microorganisms. These are known as your <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_flora"" rel=""noreferrer"">gut flora</a> or gut microbiome. Most of these are bacteria, but quite a few are other organisms, including protozoans such as Giardia. Some of these critters in your intestines are beneficial or even necessary for your metabolism, while others may be neutral or harmful. People tend to develop tolerance for their own gut flora, but can get sick from other people's. The gut microbiome tends to be more diverse among people in the developing world, less so in the developed world, and this decreased diversity may actually be a bad thing.</p>

<p>Giardia is present in about 3-7% of adults in the US, about 30% in the developing world.[Auerbach 2012] Among toddlers in the US, roughly a third have it.[Ish-Horowicz 1989] Most people who have Giardia as part of their gut flora have no symptoms at all, which is why you don't see a third of toddlers with miserable cases of diarrhea at any given time. Among people who do have symptoms, the condition is normally mild and self-limiting. For unknown reasons, there is a small portion of the population that tolerates Giardia badly if newly introduced to it, and these people have unpleasant diarrhea for some period of time.</p>

<p>Giardia is present in surface water in the form of dormant cysts. These cysts tend to resist being killed by chlorine. You can pick up Giardia by drinking water that contains cysts, but what was not realized in the 1970s, during the initial Giardia public-health panic, was that Giardia is also transmissible through hand-to-mouth contamination. In the context of backpacking, this would something like the following. A and B go backpacking together. A has Giardia in her gut microbiome, and she tolerates it and has never had any symptoms. B doesn't have it. A poops and doesn't wash her hands, and then A and B have dinner together and share pots and pans. B eats food that is contaminated with A's Giardia.</p>

<p>Many people use Giardia as a sort of generic term, like ""xerox"" or ""kleenex."" For this reason, it is common to hear backpackers claim that they ""got Giardia,"" when all they really know is that they got sick. They could have had some other condition, they could have had giardiasis but contracted it somewhere else, or they could have gotten a bug through hand-to-mouth contamination from their hiking partners.</p>

<p>Often people will make this claim when they got sick during the hike. This is unlikely. When an animal is infected by a parasite, there's a prepatent period, which is the time from infection with a parasite to when the bugs reach a life stage where they can be detected by a lab test. There's also an incubation period, which is the time from infection to symptoms. For most parasites, the prepatent period is shorter than the incubation period, but for Giardia it's often longer. A 1954 study on prison volunteers showed an average prepatent period of 9 days, but there's a wide range of variation, and the incubation period can be as long as months. In a study of travelers to the Soviet Union, the typical time until acute symptoms occurred was found to be a couple of weeks. In about two thirds of patients, the prepatency period was longer than the incubation period by a week or more. In summary, if someone gets backpacker's diarrhea while on a weekend backpacking trip, it's very unlikely that it was caused by giardiasis that they acquired during the trip.</p>

<p>As stated above, my answer only deals with pristine backcountry areas in North America. Some studies have surveyed water in these areas for Giardia.[Suk 1986],[Jaret 2003] The water was extremely clean, and huge volumes of it had to be filtered in order to pick up any detectable number of Giardia cysts. For example, there were sites in the Sierra where they filtered 100 gallons of water and didn't detect a single Giardia cyst left over in the filter. In most of the locations where cysts were detected, the concentrations were so low that they have to be expressed in scientific notation. In low-use areas, they ranged from zero to about 5x10^-3 per liter, while one high-use area had about 0.1 per liter. Elsewhere in the U.S., similar testing also found extremely low concentrations all of the backcountry locations tested: West Beaver Creek, AZ; Merced River, CA; Chattooga River, NC;
Neversink River, NY; White Pine Lake, UT; Greenwater River, WA; and Renard Lake, WI.</p>

<p>From these studies, it appears that if you spend a weekend drinking untreated water in pristine backcountry areas in the US, you will typically not ingest a single Giardia cyst. We then need to do a risk-benefit analysis. This raises the question of how many cysts you need to swallow in order to have a certain chance of getting infected, as well as the chance that this will cause symptoms. The best single source of information on the first question is a 1954 study by Rendtorff that used prison volunteers; the data are summarized and analyzed further by [Cox 2002] and [Rose 1991]. Roughly speaking, you have to ingest about 20-30 cysts to be likely to get an infection.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to know whether there is a threshold effect, i.e., whether or not there is some chance, however small, of getting sick by swallowing a single cyst. The data are not sufficient to determine this. Rose introduces a mathematical model in which it is <em>assumed</em> that each cyst has some probability p of setting up shop in your gut, but this is an assumption of the model, and is not testable based on the data, which used higher doses. Rose's model is also not consistent with data showing that even when people drink very highly contaminated water, there is still only about a 50% chance of contracting giardiasis.[Wilkerson 1992] In this type of study, one of the confounding factors is that the minimum infectious dose can vary depending on the strain of the microorganism.</p>

<p>If you do pick up a giardia infection, and if you weren't already an asymptomatic carrier, then it appears that your chance of developing symptoms is about one in 10.[Wilkerson 1992]</p>

<p>Based on these numbers, we can make at least a rough order-of-magnitude estimate of the risk associated with drinking backcountry water. Suppose you go on a weekend hiking trip in the Sierra and drink 6 liters of untreated water. In low-use areas, the concentration of Giardia cysts in your water appears to average about 3x10^-3 per liter. Based on Rose's model, take the probability of infection to be about p=.02 per cyst. If infection occurs, the chance of getting symptoms (which are in most cases mild) is on the order of 0.1. Multiplying these factors, we arrive at a probability of about 4x10^-5 that you will get Giardia symptoms. That is, under these assumptions, out of a million people who do this, about 40 are expected to get diarrhea.</p>

<p>This estimate appears to conflict with a study by Zell,[Zell 1993] which states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The incidence of Giardia cyst acquisition in backcountry travelers was
  only 5.7% (95% CI 0.17–20.2%). Mild, self-limiting gastrointestinal
  illness occurred in 16.7% of subjects (95% CI 4.9%–34.50%), none of
  whom demonstrated G. lamblia infection.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although none of the people in the study who had Giardia got symptoms, this rate of infection is many orders of magnitude higher than would have been expected from water contamination based on the Rendroff-Rose data and modeling. Unfortunately the Zell article is paywalled, so I can only see the abstract, but it appears that he would have had no way to tell whether the people who acquired infections got them from contaminated water or from hand-to-mouth contamination. In any case, Zell's conclusion is that water treatment is of marginal cost-effectiveness, given the low risk and the fact that the infection is self-limiting and usually asymptomatic.</p>

<p>Another reality check we can do is to compare the concentrations of Giardia in backcountry water with the concentrations in city tap water. This is complicated by the fact that Giardia cysts, whether found in backcountry water or tap water, may be nonviable, and surveys cannot usually determine their viability. Historically, city tap water has been getting cleaner and cleaner, especially in the developed world. However, it appears to have been normal in 20th-century America for city tap water to contain concentrations of Giardia cysts that are similar to or greater than the concentrations found in backcountry areas of the US.[Rockwell 2002] It would be interesting to get more detailed information on this from someone who has professional-level knowledge of US water supplies and their history.</p>

<p>A meta-analysis of the literature in 2000 concluded that ""the evidence for an association between drinking backcountry water and acquiring giardiasis is minimal.""[Welch 2000] When people do actually contract backpacker's diarrhea from exposure during a hiking trip, by far the most common reason is hand-to-mouth contamination.[Welch 1995]</p>

"Why should the angle in a rope attached to two anchors be 60 degrees or less?","1304","","<p><a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/a/331/2766"">This question</a> asks how to set up a top rope anchor. It states that <em>No angle of tension shall exceed 60 degrees</em>. Why?</p>
","<p>The diagram shows three situations that are easy to understand without knowing a lot of math or physics.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/92lt2.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>In the first example, the angle between the anchor strands is zero. Both anchors pull straight up on the biner, and each supports 50% of the load.</p>

<p>In the second example, all three angles are 120 degrees. The situation is totally symmetrical, so all three forces are equal in strength. Each anchor strand has to be able to support 100% of the load. For example, if the climber is hanging from the rope (a static load), and weighs 100 pounds, then each anchor strand will also be subject to 100 pounds of stress. This is obviously not that great a situation, and each anchor is just as likely to fail as if you had simply hung the climber off of that anchor alone. However, the anchor is redundant, so this is still better than a single anchor.</p>

<p>The third example shows a hypothetical situation where the angle at the top opens up to 180 degrees. This isn't actually physically possible. Each anchor strand is only applying a horizontal force to the biner. There is no upward force on the biner that could cancel the downward force from the climber's strand. No matter how tight you were to pull the two anchor strands, they would never flatten out to 180 degrees. As the angle gets closer and closer to 180 degrees, the strain approaches infinity, and you're guaranteed that something in the system will fail. Maybe the rope will snap, or maybe the biner will break, or maybe one of the anchors will pull out.</p>

<p>There is nothing magic about 60 degrees. As the angle increases, the stress on each anchor increases. An angle of 50 degrees could be too much, if your anchors were poor and you needed to hold a big dynamic load. An angle of 90 degrees could be perfectly OK, if the anchors were good and they just needed to hold a small static load. There could be a situation where I just had no choice but to do an arrangement like the 120-degree example, because it just wasn't physically possible to set up with a smaller angle. (Maybe something's in the way, or there's not enough rope, or the smaller angle would require the biner to be so low that I couldn't safely reach it, or the smaller angle would send anchor strands over a sharp knife-edge of rock.) I would still prefer such a setup to a non-redundant anchor.</p>

"Should you avoid handling lambs?","1302","","<p>On a recent walk we ended up with a lamb following us. I picked it up and took it back to its mother. </p>

<p>As I walked past someone else on the trail shouted that I shouldn't 
 touch the lambs as ""it will follow you now"".</p>

<p>I didn't think it was a problem as I'd picked up lambs in farms (with the farmers permission) before. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5vPgg.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>So should I have handled the lamb? Should I have actually just ignored it? </p>

<p>Will picking up the lamb do <strong>it</strong> any harm?</p>
","<p>The only way you could do the lamb harm by picking it up <em>(aside from dropping it, or otherwise injuring it by handling it wrong)</em> is if for one reason or another it wasn't accepted back into its herd, or if your interaction gave it a reason to leave the herd. </p>

<p>Some animals will reject their dependant young if they smell like human, as far as I'm aware this is not true of sheep. Domesticated animals don't reject their offspring if they detect human scent. <em>It's a known behaviour for some deer</em>–which is why petting newborn fawns is taboo–but often times this largely depends on the mother, as it's not guaranteed that <em>all</em> does will react the same way to the smell of human on their young. It also depends on the size of the baby, it's only at risk of abandonment if it's too little to keep up with it's mother, or if it hasn't weaned yet. </p>

<p>Sheep are often handled by people (sheering, herding, children taking lambs as pets, etc.), I don't think they're going to feel threatened if they catch a hint of one. I think what that other hiker was referring to is the potential the lamb could have to taking a liking to you to the point where it might leave it's herd and follow you home, or come looking for you and end up lost and alone. Lambs are a lot like puppies in that they can crave affection. If you give it affection (picking it up and holding it) you could win the lamb over and make it want to come back for more. </p>

"What's a realistic distance to expect boys aged 11-17 to sea kayak in a single day?","1301","","<p>I'm thinking about taking my Scout troop (boys aged 11-17) on a sea kayaking trip.  What expectations should I have for the distance that we can travel in one day?  Assume good weather (clear skies, very light winds, and calm seas).</p>
","<p>If you don't know what your boys are capable of then it's unfair to have expectations.</p>

<p>I'm a Venturer Scout adviser for Scouts Canada; I take boys in that age group on trips regularly. I don't know what your group is like, but if it's anything like mine, then the boys probably all have different levels of ability, strength, and skill. For trips like this one, you can only go as far or as fast as the slowest boy. My experience has taught me that you can't realistically set goals for distance unless you already know what your boys are capable of. </p>

<p>Before you even plan your trip, I would recommend that you plan a day or two of kayaking just to see what your boys in fact can do. Don't plan on covering a certain distance, just plan on being on the water for a certain amount of time. You can then use this time to answer your own question by keeping track of their progress over a certain amount of time or distance. It's important make sure that your boys also have a firm grasp of basic skills, and how to respond in case of an emergency. I always take my boys to a local lake just to have them paddle around together before I'll consider taking them on trips. I give them all a quick instruction, then let them play for a bit while I observe so I can get a sense of what their natural ability levels are. I'll get them to play games too; races are a good way to separate the fastest from the slowest. If you're using two-person kayaks, this can help you balance the group by pairing the stronger paddlers with the weaker ones.</p>

<p>If you know you won't have an opportunity to assess your boys before you take them on a trip, then you need to either plan a trip that anyone of any skill level could accomplish, have more than one plan in case Plan A doesn't pan out, or supplement the trip with other activities. South California is obviously different than up here, so you probably can't just tell the more adventurous boys to paddle off and explore a nearby island while the exhausted boys hang out by the fire and rest their aching arms, but you could perhaps have them paddle to the horizon and back, or have them create an obstacle course where they paddle to a point and back, then sprint-portage the kayak down the beach, and paddle to another point, etc...</p>

<p>I gave up having expectations without experience a long time ago. Get to know your boys, have them set goals, then let them have the expectations.</p>

"Why does abseiling become easier gradually?","1299","","<p>When I am abseiling, the rope is initially hard to feed through my braking device - if I take my hands away from the rope, I get stuck in mid-air.</p>

<p>However, as I am getting lower, it gradually gets easier, until at some point the rope starts running by itself. Now, if I took my hands away from the rope (thought experiment - imagine I have no backup braking device), I would accelerate down and hit the ground very hard.</p>

<p>Why is this so? The rope is vertical, and I don't touch any wall, and yet it somehow matters whether I am situated high or low on the rope.</p>

<p>To avoid this, as well as any possible rope entanglements from throwing your rope over the side of a cliff, you can rappel with your rope flaked out nicely in a sling clipped to the side of your harness, and let it out as you descend, this eliminates the extra weight on the device:</p>

<p>The idea, from a training perspective, is that if the rock rings are hanging from rope you have to expend more effort with your core to keep your body from swinging. And building core strength is important in climbing.</p>

"Does a pound on your foot equal 5 pounds on your back?","1281","","<p>I have heard a number of people say that a pound on your foot equals 5 pounds on your back. Is there any hard evidence to support this claim and how does the terrain affect it?</p>
","<p>Yes - it's true.</p>

<p>The source is a 1984 study by the U.S. Army Research Institute, which found that it takes up to 6.4 times as much energy to move at a given pace when weight is carried in the footwear as against the torso. </p>

<p>When I was a kid we all walked in monsters like this, at almost 4 lbs a pair (and that's <strong>before</strong> they get wet!):</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KFrra.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KFrra.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>This is the equivalent of around 20 lbs in your pack. I still see a lot of people shod like this, particularly continentals in the Western Alps.</p>

<p>Now (unless it's icy) I walk the hills in minimalist shoes like these, at around 1lb per pair. This is the equivalent of dropping over 15lbs from my pack. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wVfSz.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wVfSz.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>It's been a total liberation. My feet, knees and hips function as they evolved to function, and I'm experiencing far less fatigue, wear and tear. And I've never had so much as a hot-spot, never mind a blister.</p>

<p>Heavy boots are supposed to provide ankle protection, but because they don't allow your power train to function properly I used to experience regular injuries - sometimes quite serious. Walking thousands of miles in more natural shoes, I've never had a problem.</p>

<p>And being able to actually feel the ground beneath your feed adds a great deal of enjoyment to walking, at least for me. I wouldn't want to isolate myself from the ground again any more than I'd want to wear chain-mail to make love.</p>

<p>Of course wearing light footwear does involve some commitment and a change of attitude. You have to transition carefully and rebuild the natural strength in your feet. You have to step lightly and accurately on difficult ground. You have to lighten your pack. You have to pick the right shoes for the job, or adapt them to the terrain with removable rock-plates. It's all part of a more lightweight approach to moving and living in the mountains.</p>

<p>For me there's no turning back. I've walked long distances over tough terrain, and as I've built my strength and skills it's become an integral part of my enjoyment of the hills.</p>

"Is it safe to tie a canoe to the top of your car like this?","1278","","<p>This time of year, you see a lot of canoes and kayaks going down the road tied to the top of cars. Some of them not as smartly anchored as others.  </p>

<p>One of the configurations that I see a lot is the ""It's not going off the back"" method. A quick look at google finds these two examples:</p>

<p>Is this method to transport your canoe safe or will it be likely to be lost while driving? What is wrong with this tie down method? </p>
","<p>To answer your underlying idea, mounting a canoe on the roof of a regular car can easily be done safely - however you've chosen two poor examples. </p>

<p>First photo: not safe</p>

<p>There's no proper roof-bars. The type of foam pads used aren't suitable for anything bigger than a surf-board. Used like this they will also damage the car roof. I wouldn't ever consider the type of tail mount used. </p>

<p>Second photo: better - right idea but poorly executed. </p>

<p>Here we see the boat on proper roof-bars with good straps. However, the boat should be centred on these, even if this means sticking out more at the back. </p>

<p>Correct: 
Solid roof-bars (available for all normal cars), with the bars spaced out as much as possible and the boat centred on these - with good quality straps used to secure the boat to the bars. A rear light should be added where necessary. </p>

<p>Note: when the boat is centred, this prevents forward/back movement because the straps are either side of the middle/widest point. </p>

<p>Note2: both photos place a heavy emphasis on  nose/tail strapping. In reality they add very little and should never be relied upon. They can help reduce bouncing but if the boat isn't secure without them, it won't be secure with them. </p>

"How to find climbing shoes for toe and heel hooks?","1274","","<p><strong>How can I choose the right climbing shoes especially for toe and heel hooking?</strong></p>

<p>More specifically: I have been using very comfortable beginner shoes for the last two years. When I started to advance to higher grades I realized how often you can use toe and heel hooks for your problems. However, my shoes did not grab small holds and I even struggled with huge holds when toe hooking. When I used my
friends shoes all these problems faded away.</p>
","<p>Here are some features to keep in mind when buying climbing shoes once you're past the beginner phase:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Downturned</strong>: Most beginner shoes are pretty flat, which are fine for mainly vertical walls. However, as you climb harder stuff on overhanging walls, it's helpful to have downturned shoes for maintaining a hook-like foot shape. This allows you to hook your toes onto small foot holds to keep your body on the wall or rock.  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HPigD.png"" alt=""enter image description here""> </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Good-fitting Heel Cup</strong>: You want to make sure the shoe fits your heel snugly, or else your heel will feel like it's slipping out during heel hooks. This is something you just have to try on at the store, since a lot of people's feet are different. Personally, I've tried on several shoes that were very tight fitting otherwise but had a lot of dead space in the heel, which is undesirable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rubber covering top of shoe</strong>: Make sure the top part of the shoe has rubber covering it to help with toe hooks. Most beginner shoes just have the canvas material on top of the shoe, which makes toe hooks less effective and the shoe can wear out faster. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Py17s.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rubber Type</strong>: Not all climbing shoe rubber is the same. Some are harder, some are softer (stickier). Harder rubber is good for edging off of small foot holds, and it's more durable. As an example, the Five Ten Team VXi (pictured below) has the softest, stickiest rubber I've seen and is great for overhanging climbs since it molds to really small footholds well. However, it would not be an ideal shoe for a route with lots of edging. This is probably less of a consideration, though, compared to the other 4 points for most shoes. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HmsGd.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sizing</strong>: Don't make the mistake of getting the tightest fitting shoe you can fit your feet into at the store. Make sure it at least feels bearable to stand on your toes or on a small ledge in the store. A little discomfort is fine (that will get less over time), but if it's very painful get a larger size. Yes, it would eventually stretch out a little bit, but only if you wear it many times (and experience a lot of pain all those times). </p></li>

"What are the Pros and Cons of No-Cook Backpacking?","1271","","<p>While perusing my gear this morning, it occurred to me that I hadn't bothered to buy or make a stove for backpacking. On the whole, I'm not a big fan of hot food, even when I'm a mite chilled. </p>

<p><strong>What are the Pros and Cons of No-Cook Backpacking?</strong> I'm interested in responses  regarding a three-season/non-winter conditions in a temperate climate, but wouldn't mind additional information about other climates.</p>

<p><em>Side-note on the tags: Yes, I am aware that the ""Cooking"" tag being here is a little paradoxical. It's included because this has to do with food preparation.</em></p>
","<p>I usually don't carry any kind of stove with me when I go hunting - this could be anytime from September to November or in May and early June.  The weather can vary wildly during these times and I've experienced every kind of weather, from 10 below (F) and snow, to 30 degrees and freezing rain, to 90 (F) and dry.  I found that going without hot food for up to a week is not a big deal - for me.  That said, I prefer hot meals so, outside of a hunting/backpacking trip, I put more effort into my meals.</p>

<p>The <strong>pros</strong> of not cooking while backpacking:</p>

<ol>
<li>You have <strong>more time</strong> to spend doing other things.  Meal preparation time can vary, for example, boiling water for some quick oatmeal is much quicker than making enchiladas or wild strawberry pie in a dutch oven (yes, I have known two backpackers that carry small dutch ovens and eat like kings).  But still, it takes time to open your pack, set up your cooking gear, cook the meal, clean up, and repack.  If you are busy doing other things, such as hiking or watching wildlife in the evening, then maybe this is a chore that should be eliminated.</li>
<li>Not taking cooking gear <strong>reduces weight</strong> and gives you <strong>extra space</strong> in your pack for other things.  However, this might be cancelled by the increased bulk and weight of the food itself, mentioned in con #6 below.</li>
<li>Preparing your meals so that you can eat all day means you will be <strong>less hungry</strong>.  Instead of having two or three big meals and a couple snacks, you can simply eat whenever you feel like it.  Often, I feel a lot better when I simply snack all day.</li>
<li>Buying a stove, and cookwear, and the just-add-water meals can get expensive.  Not buying them and preparing simple foods at home can <strong>save</strong> a good deal of <strong>money</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The <strong>cons</strong> of not cooking while backpacking:</p>

<ol>
<li>Cooking in the mountains can be very enjoyable.  Planning not to cook <strong>eliminates an enjoyable activity</strong> (although cooking in downpours and high winds can be very frustrating).</li>
<li><strong>You might need a hot meal.</strong>  A hot meal can really perk you up at the end of a long day when you're tired, or maybe feeling a little homesick.</li>
<li>Your <strong>choices</strong> of foods/meals are a bit <strong>limited</strong>, which dampens the whole outdoor experience, unless your trip is a short one, or if you can conquer #4.</li>
<li>To eat healthy while not cooking, <strong>you need to be more creative</strong>.  Coming up with a list of foods that you can (and will) eat can be daunting if you aren't used to, or you don't enjoy, creating healthy menus.</li>
<li><strong>Unprepared</strong>. If you find that you do want to cook a meal (do you fish?), you will need to resort to using a campfire which may not be allowed at some places and times (some parks, fire season, etc.).</li>
<li>Foods that are ready to eat are generally <strong>bulkier and heavier</strong>.  Just imagine a couple peanut butter sandwiches next to a cup of uncooked rice.  By the way, I don't advise carrying peanut butter sandwiches beyond day #1 :)</li>
</ol>

<p>Even when I backpack without typical cooking gear, I'm still prepared to make an emergency meal in case my body temperature gets too low or I simply want or need something hot.  For this, I carry a stainless steel cup and a couple packets of tea and a small ziploc or two of quick oats and sugar (don't forget a spoon!).  Of course, if and when I use these, a fire is then required.</p>

<p>Just as a side note here, since you mentioned ""non-winter conditions"": if you intend on backpacking in the Rocky Mountains, be prepared for cold weather at any time of the year.  On July 27, this year, here in eastern Idaho, we had a couple inches of hail in the lower areas and snow in the mountains.  Two days later, although the weather was beautiful and in the 70's, I found 4 inches of snow still covering the trail, in places, on a section of the Continental Divide Trail.  It's never really ""non-winter"" in the Rockies.</p>

<p>I am looking for recommendations for what kind of underwear to wear inside by union suit in the winter that will be moisture repellent?</p>
","<p>When you are facing a serious sweating problem, maybe your overall setup is too warm. What layers/jackets do you wear above the one-suite-fleece? I am thinking of a very thin layer which is highly breathable and will just be a shelter against the elements (wind, rain/snow) like e.g. the Gore Active Shell.</p>

<p>Still, sweating to some degree is pretty normal. What I can recommend in general is merino wool. It feels comfortable and warm also when it is wet. It also dries fast. Please check <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/a/5719/2653"">this link</a>. Also very very nice is that merino doesn't attract bacteria like common materials like cotton or synthetics. Especially for underwear this is a unique and great feature. Going on multi-day trips you (and your friends) are still fine when you have 2 pieces of underwear with you.</p>

<p>Relating the comment of @amphibient:</p>

<p>You are right, cotton absorbs the sweat which isn't that favourable. Synthetics and also wool will transport the moisture to the outside. Your outer layers have to work the same way, otherwise your system won't work. Wearing a high-end merino shirt won't help when you have a cotton pullover over it.</p>

<p>Regarding your one-piece fleece midlayer and your one-piece hardshell outer layer, this might be great in terms of being waterproof and warm (no wind will break in) but I think you don't have the versatile options normal setups have. I am able to open zippers under the arms or open the main zipper from the top or even from the bottom when I feel slightly too warm. This lets me react to changes in weather/activity nicely.</p>

"Deer activity in the wet","1267","","<p>Over the years, when out walking and on my commute through the countryside I've noticed that, when it's intensely pouring with rain, Roe deer seems to come out of the forests into open fields to eat.</p>

<p>I would have thought being out in the rain would reduce their ability to hear predators sneak up on them. However that said, in the UK there are no natural predators for Roe deer and they are only culled by the forestry commission and other governing bodies.</p>

<p>Why do they come out to eat like this in the rain? And can you use it to your advantage when hunting?</p>
","<p>This behavior is well-known to be honest. There's this myth that white-tail activity increases if it rains (the deer seeks shelter). However, the truth is that this doesn't really affect the daily routine. The animal just takes it as something what happens from time to time. </p>

<p>As you may already know the two main sense of a deer is its ability to smell and to hear. Both of these senses are nearly blocked while it rains. This is just getting worse if the rain intensifies. </p>

<p>The reaction of the deer is easy: compensate this loss with another sense. This, in fact, means, that they want <em>to see</em>. Where do they see? Not in the dark forest but rather in the open fields. </p>

<p>I've found <a href=""http://www.grandviewoutdoors.com/big-game-hunting/hunting-whitetails-in-the-rain/"">a good article</a> regarding this topic:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s no secret deer rely on their senses of smell and hearing as top
  lines of defense. Rain can influence both. Swirling clouds of
  molecules, scent, both good and bad, can be rain-washed from the air,
  making it difficult for deer to smell that which the nose would have
  otherwise known. Too, the steady pitter-patter of rain on the leaves
  fills a deer’s ears with aural clutter — potentially
  predator-disguising clutter.</p>
  
  <p>Deer recognize these situations, and will often attempt to compensate
  by increasing the emphasis placed upon the third sense, sight. How?
  Heightened visual awareness, something the animal can accomplish
  easily by frequenting areas which offer extended fields of vision.
  Hidden meadows, field edges, or powerline right-of-ways are three
  examples. Simply put, go to where deer can see, and you’ll see deer.</p>

<p>And yes of course, you can use this as an advantage to hunt.

If I didn't have this longer toe I would wear a 9 or 9.5 (depending on the manufacturer) but with the toe I am forced to go a size larger or be in pain. When playing sports like hockey, rugby or rock climbing, I buy the smaller size and let the toe get bunched up. It will be less than an hour so I can suffer through it. In hiking and such where the activity will be a lot longer I can't last that long and need to buy the larger boot so I am not in pain. The problem then comes that my foot slides around in the boot which causes slipping problems when on rocky terrain and blisters from ill fitting shoes.</p>

","<p>I'm not aware of any boots for your specific need, but there may be some other options using a larger size boot.</p>

<p>Preferably you should have little if any pressure from your toes against the front of your boot. For me, the solution to a loose boot has been to add a second insole which keeps a laced boot snug at the ankle while leaving the toes with room to move.

<p>Norovirus is very, very contagious. It can be spread:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>close contact with someone with norovirus – they may breathe out    small particles containing the virus that you could inhale</li>
  <li>touching contaminated surfaces or objects – the virus can survive    outside the body for several days</li>
  <li>eating contaminated food – this can happen if an infected person    doesn't wash their hands before handling food</li>

<blockquote>
  <h2>Preventing norovirus</h2>
  
  <p>It's not always possible to avoid getting norovirus, but following the
  advice below can help stop the virus spreading.</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><em>Stay off work or school until at least 48 hours after the symptoms    have passed. You should also avoid visiting anyone in hospital during 
  this time.</em></li>
  <li><em>Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water,    particularly after using the toilet and before preparing food. Don't rely on alcohol hand gels, as they do not kill the virus.</em></li>
  <li><em>Disinfect any surfaces or objects that could be contaminated. It's    best to use a bleach-based household cleaner.</em></li>
  <li><em>Wash any items of clothing or bedding that could have become    contaminated separately on a hot wash to ensure the virus is killed.</em></li>
  <li>Don't share towels and flannels.</li>

"How to lock a kayak","1256","","<p>In my garage, and when it is parked around town, I lock my bike to a rack via a U-lock or at least a cable lock.
How should I similarly secure my kayak?
I realize that a determined thief can break most locks but let’s assume conventional bike locks are good enough to deter casual thieves.</p>
","<p>Most solutions require threading one or two long lockable cables through some sort of “holes” in the kayak and onto the fixed rack. The locking cables can be elongated versions of standard bicycle cable locks. However, you may require a “python” cable lock, which allows the working end to be thin and to be tightened through the lock.</p>

<p>Kayaks can have a number of different things serving as “holes”:</p>

<ul>
<li>A metal grab handle.</li>
<li>A large metal pad eye.</li>
<li>A scupper hole, if the kayak is a sit-on-top (SOT).</li>

"Why do big wall harnesses have two belay loops?","1256","","<p>I've been looking at big wall harnesses and I've been noticing that a lot of them come with two belay loops: </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TvqoC.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8IuN7.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I know that it isn't there as a back up. What's the advantage of having two belay loops on your harness when aid climbing?</p>
","<p>It's simply for organization sake.</p>

<p>Aid climbing on big-walls involves lots of gear, and you'll very quickly realize how much of a mess your perfectly racked gear will become.</p>

<p>With two belay loops you can separate your aid ladders and daisy chains a little, which helps to keep them from wrapping around each other (and keep things a little bit cleaner too).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IpWmR.jpg"" alt=""Pete&#39;s picture from MP showing gear quantities""></p>

<p>Couldn't find a good close-up picture for you, but Pete's picture from MP is a good visual indication of exactly how much is going on around your belay loop sometimes when climbing big-walls.</p>

"If the Dawn Wall's been climbed before why is the current attempt so difficult?","1255","","<p>There's a lot of talk in the <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-30793748"">media at the moment about Kevin Jorgeson and Tommy Caldwell Free ascent of the dawn wall of El Capitan</a>. </p>

<p>This wall's been climbed before but this is the first time it's been free climbed. What are Kevin Jorgeson and Tommy Caldwell doing differently now that hasn't been done before?</p>
","<p>The Dawn wall is one of the largest and most difficult climbs in the world, it's nearly 1000m of blankness, there isn't a lot to hold onto all the way up.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hbFM4.jpg"" alt=""Dawn Wall&#39;s climbing route""></p>

<p>But you're right, it has been ""climbed"" before. The Dawn wall was <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Capitan"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">first climbed in 1970 by Warren Harding and Dean Caldwell</a>. These climbers used a different technique to what Kevin Jorgeson and Tommy Caldwell are using today.They (Harding and Caldwell), and everyone else after them, used <strong>Aid Climbing</strong> to climb this wall. Where as Kevin Jorgeson and Tommy Caldwell are <strong>Free climbing</strong> the Dawn wall. So what's the difference?</p>

<h2>Aid Climbing</h2>

<p>Aid climbing uses a series of specialist tools to scale the wall. These vary considerably from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring-loaded_camming_device"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mechanical cams</a> to sharp <a href=""http://www.andy-kirkpatrick.com/articles/view/beaks"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bird beaks</a>. The idea of this <em>""aid""</em> is that you place it on (or in) the rock above you and hang special ladder like devices called <a href=""http://www.metoliusclimbing.com/aiders.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""aiders""</a> from. You then climb the aiders and place another piece of gear, repeat. All your weight is taken by the gear on the wall. You don't really climb (the rock at least) with your hands and feet. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZxTJx.jpg"" alt=""Climber using aid""></p>

<h2>Free climbing</h2>

<p><strong>Not to be confused with Free soloing (where no rope is used)</strong>. Free climbing is what most people think of when they think of climbing. You climb using your hands and feet. You still place protection using similar tools to aid climbing but these are below you, not above you and are designed to catch you should you fall. The climbers use special sticky shoes to aid friction with their feet and often tape hands but apart from that they pull on the rock using their hands and feet.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SCfOH.jpg"" alt=""Climber free climbing""></p>

<p>So Kevin Jorgeson and Tommy Caldwell are the first people to climb the Dawn wall without using aid.</p>

<hr>

<p>A lot of people get Free climbing and Free soloing mixed up. For completeness <strong>Free soloing</strong> is when you climb as in free climbing but without the protection (or rope) to prevent serious falls. No one has ever free soloed the Dawn Wall.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3BN4D.jpg"" alt=""Climber free soloing""></p>

<p>Since writing this, <strong>Alex Honnold has (amazingly) <a href=""https://www.climbing.com/news/alex-honnold-completes-first-free-solo-of-el-capitan/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">free solo'd El Capitan</a></strong>....he didn't do the same route as Jorgeson and Caldwell he did  Freerider (which at <em>VI, 5.13a</em> is slightly easier than the dawn wall.)</p>

"Is clipping directly onto a dyneema sling safe?","1255","","<p>I was recently doing a scramble route in North Wales. We needed to get past a large rock spike, though easy climbing, it was quite exposed and not a good place to take a fall. As a safety backup I attached a long dyneema sling over a large spike and clipped this directly onto my harness. This was more confidence protection than anything as the move was straight forward. </p>

<p>We did this for speed, we did have a rope but didn't want to spend the time getting it out, etc. just to pass a relatively small section.</p>

<p>It occurred to me afterwards though that maybe this wasn't such a great idea. There was nothing in the system to really absorb any impact. The fall onto the sling would have been minimal (maybe 1m).</p>

<p>Are there any problems with attaching a sling directly onto your harness like this? We didn't use a crows foot or any other knot. Just a sling and one carabiner.</p>

<p>Here's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21RrJ_ISVx4"" rel=""nofollow"">a video of my girlfriend doing the above for context</a></p>
","<p>Was it better than no protection? Probably. Would I recommend it? No.</p>

<p>The reason is this: DMM performed <a href=""http://dmmclimbing.com/knowledge/how-to-break-nylon-dyneema-slings/"">some tests</a> where they anchored a sling to a carabiner and a load (80kg), and dropped the load from various heights. The results are a bit more nuanced, but the gist is that you should never fall onto a sling from at or above the anchor without any dynamic elements in the system. This sentence sums it up nicely: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Even a 60 cm fall-factor 1 fall on to an open Dyneema® sling can generate enough impact force (16.7 kN) at the anchor to pull a Wallnut 11 wire (12 kN) apart. Tying a knot in a Dyneema® sling weakens it even further leading to sling failure in a fall-factor 1 loading on to a 120 cm sling.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You probably wouldn't want to experience a force of 16.7 kN, which is what would happen if you fell with the harness at the height of the anchor. </p>

<p><em>However</em>, it might be fine if you stay well below the highest point of the anchor. But I couldn't find any reference to that situation, so I can't comment on that situation specifically. </p>

"Recovering from Hypothermia","1251","","<p>I am not much used to Camping in Cold areas. But I have been told by hikers that Hypothermia is something that I should be very careful of. Since childhood, it has been like, I don't catch cold very often, but in windy places when the air is cold, I feel my hands get numb, and legs shiver a bit.<br>
Having said this, I am going for a hike in cold, not snowy though, I am a little worried about Hypothermia. When struck by Hypothermia, one has to remain awake. And, sleeping actually make your body warmer. Can a dip in the hot-water help for that matter? Is the Body-Heat (obviously from someone else) a good option? Or will that freeze my guy, like me? </p>
","<p>You actually don't need to go outdoors to get struck by Hypothermia. But you can suffer from it on a trek where you don't have a proper campsite, camping equipment, or good clothing and bedding. </p>

<p>From <a href=""http://www.globalaging.org/health/us/hypothermia.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.globalaging.org/health/us/hypothermia.htm</a> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most important step in treating hypothermia is to make and then keep a person warm and dry. He/she must be seen by a doctor who knows about the condition and who is located in a well-equipped hospital emergency room. Once you get to an Hospital facility, they can keep you warm from outside and or inside, they can give you some Body-Warming fluid through an I.V or Injections.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe until you get to the Hospital, someone else's body heat may help, but will that be enough? And, will he be warm enough? Can't say!</p>

<p>More from <a href=""http://www.globalaging.org/health/us/hypothermia.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.globalaging.org/health/us/hypothermia.htm</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you suspect that a person has hypothermia and emergency help is not available right away, move the person to a warmer location, if possible, and wrap him or her in a warm blanket to stop further heat loss. You can also use your own body heat to keep the person warm. Lie close to the victim, but be gentle and do not handle the person roughly. Rubbing the person's arms and legs, as many rescuers are tempted to do, can make the problem worse.</p>
  
  <p>Chances for recovery depend on how long a person was exposed to the cold and his/her general health. If body temperature has not dropped below 90° F (32.2° C), chances for a total recovery are usually good. If body temperature has fallen to between 80° F (26.6° C) and 90° F (32.2° C), most people will recover, but some lasting damage is likely. If the temperature goes under 80° F (26.6° C), most victims will not survive.</p>

"Are there any affordable night vision goggles that are good and available to civilians?","1247","","<p>I quite often go hiking in the evening after work and I have a good head torch but sometimes I wish I had some night vision goggles because often a headtorch will scare wildlife and cause farm animals to go crazy (not so good if you are on a footpath going through a field). Ideally I would like some that were not heavy and don't move around a lot when I walk. This may not exist (From google searches I've seen there are cheap ones from china that look like they don't work, ones for hunting that you cant really walk in and very expensive military grade ones).</p>
","<p>There are 3 main types of night vision equipment;</p>

<p>Image intensification </p>

<p>This is the type most commonly used by the military. It works by effectively amplifying the available light and may work in visible or IR spectrum or both and works in a similar way to a TV camera. These systems rely on some light e.g. from stars or moon being available and won't work in total darkness. In a military context they have the advantage that they are passive and as such difficult to detect with similar equipment. </p>

<p>Active Night Vision </p>

<p>This works by using a source of infra red illumination which is close to but outside the range of human vision which can be detected by a sensor similar to a digital video camera this has the advantage of providing better resolution than passive systems but is detectable to other nigh vision users. </p>

<p>Thermal imaging </p>

<p>This detects the longer wavelength IR emitted by warm or hot objects such as people, animals and vehicles, it is however much less useful for general navigation. </p>

<hr>

<p>All night vision equipment is by its nature somewhat heavy and bulky, although each generation has seen smaller and lighter units even the most sophisticated ones are somewhat cumbersome and the latest technology will, of course be the most expensive. Similarly military units are usually worn with helmets which offsets their awkwardness somewhat as they have a stable mounting platform which can counterbalance them to some extent. </p>

<p>Another disadvantage is that, like all optical devices, they can narrow your field of vision and distort depth perception which somewhat offsets their benefits in navigating at night, especially over uneven ground. For example try walking around just looking through the viewfinder of a camera, it is not easy. </p>

<p>Even in  military context NV would not necessarily be used for just covering ground at night.</p>

<p>An alternative is to use a torch with a red filter or red LEDs this reduces the overall brightness and tends to be much less noticeable at a distance and is less disruptive to your own night vision. </p>

<p>It is also possible that wildlife is more bothered by the erratic movement of the light source than the light itself so you might be better off with something which produces a diffuse omnidirectional glow than a tight beam headtorch. </p>

<p>If you give your night vision time to adapt it is rare that it is too dark to navigate at all and even when it is all you need is a bit of a diffuse glow to help you see where you are putting your feet and any obstacles coming up. In fact a very gentle light source is often more useful than something very bright which ruins your night vision. </p>

<p>So it may in fact be the case that what you really need is less light not more. From a more philosophical perspective you may find that walking in darkness brings your other sense more into play and you get a different perspective on your environment and forces you to be more aware or your surroundings rather than being constrained to a narrow field of artificial illumination.  This will also make you more aware of the noise that you are making and in turn reduce the disturbance you cause to wildlife. </p>

"Hiking boot fit: how snug should height of instep feel","1246","","<p>I have been trying on some new hiking boots.  The ones that seem most comfortable in every other way feel somewhat snug on the top of the front of my foot (the instep, I think).  Possibly because of this snugness, these boots seem to hold my foot in place better than any others I've tried, and I don't get any issues with my toes sliding forward when walking downhill, or with my ankles lifting at all.  But I worry that the pressure on the top of the foot may cause problems.  None of the boot fitting guides I've found online have discussed the height/fit of this part of the boot.  The boots are not painful when they're on, but they are exerting pressure on the top of the foot, even when totally unlaced.  I can't tell if this is a good thing or something to avoid.</p>
","<p>A bit of pressure at the top of your foot will not cause any long-term problems, so long as it isn't causing any pain. Boots are designed to hold your foot in place — the snug fit in the midfoot is an important component in keeping your toes from sliding forward when walking downhill or side-to-side when climbing. This additional stability will also reduce heel movement, helping to prevent blisters. In minimalist shoes, a tight midfoot fit allows for a larger toebox and additional toe splay, but that's a feature unlikely to be included in a hiking boot design.</p>

<p>Be aware, however, that your feet will swell after a long hike. Most of the swelling typically occurs widthwise and lengthwise, but the top of your foot may swell slightly as well. This can normally be accounted for by adjusting the laces, but be sure that you have room to make that adjustment.</p>

<p>One last personal note: I have a very high instep, and most shoes are tight enough there to be painful. I've started re-lacing my shoes to skip that section. This allows me to fully tighten the laces for a snug fit without causing undue pain and pressure in the instep.</p>

","<p>You could do a lot worse than strip them and get in a sleeping bag with them, and indeed this <em>used</em> to be instructed as standard first aid for hypothermia. However, as far as I'm aware this has now changed and the recommended approach is to construct a 1 person thermal burrito / hyper-wrap.</p>

<p>It's done as follows (content taken from the <a href=""http://alpineinstitute.blogspot.co.uk/2008/08/burrito-hypothermia-wrap.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">alpine institute blog</a>!)</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>

  <li>Place 1 or 2 pads down on top of the tarp. Two pads are always better than one.</li>
  <li>Stack three sleeping bags on top of the pads.</li>
  <li>Place the victim inside the sleeping bag in the middle.</li>
  <li>Wrap the victim in the tarp.</li>

  <p>Most syrup is produced in the northern states, but can be made as far south as Tennessee. <strong>The temperature must drop below freezing at night and rise above during the day for the sap to run.

"How are sleeping bag temperature ratings determined?","1241","","<p>One things that has always troubled me when buying a sleeping bag is the temperature rating.  When looking at a bag that claims to be a +15°F bag (for example) how do I know that it is <strong>really</strong> good down to 15 degrees Fahrenheit (preferably without buying it)?</p>

<p>Is the rating just determined by the manufacturer, or is there any sort of independent validation/criteria on these ratings?</p>
","<p>Sadly, in North America, there is no rating beyond what each manufacturer decides for itself.  I suspect that in the US especially, some thought goes into liability (i.e. if someone freezes to death in a bag that's rated to 0F and it's 20F out, they could be in trouble).  Certain manufacturers gain a reputation for conservative ratings, others for optimistic ratings... and sadly, some manufacturers are all over the map (i.e. don't use an internally consistent rating system at all).</p>

<p>Fortunately, there is a standard that is (hopefully) coming to North America, called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EN_13537"">EN 13537</a>.  It is currently applied to all bags in the EU and certain manufacturers elsewhere.</p>

<p>The standard establishes a way to test sleeping bags, and then provides each bag with a set of ratings from an lower ""you won't die"" limit, all the way up to ""you will be sweaty"" upper limit.</p>

<p>There's another wrinkle though, which is that a lot of the warmth people attribute to their ""awesome"" sleeping bag, comes from a combination of other factors:  sleeping pad R-value, sleeping clothing, tent heat retention, site selection, and what I'll call metabolism (i.e. whether you are a ""cold"" or ""hot"" sleeper).</p>

<p>So when you ask whether a 15F bag is really good to 15F, I'd say that it's impossible to know without getting the bag and trying it, at least in North America.  I think if you know you have controlled all the other variables, and are a ""hot"" sleeper, with research you can likely  find out which manufacturers are conservative raters, and go with them.  In Europe, you'd just need to know where you fit in their spectrum of ratings and buy similar bags to that in a different temperature range (much easier!).</p>

<p>An example that might help explain what I'm talking about:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.montbell.us/products/disp.php?cat_id=796&amp;p_id=2321138"">Montbell U.L. SUPER SPIRAL DOWN HUGGER #1</a> is EN rated as 26F ""Comfort"", 15F ""Lower Limit"", -19F ""Extreme"".  When it's sold in the US, that usually just translates as a ""15F bag"".</li>

<p>There are lots of solar panels to choose from, any one will probably do the job, so shop for one that suits you. <strong>What you really need</strong> in your situation, <strong>is an <em>adapter</em></strong> to charge your sony specific batteries using USB power (which most backpacking solar panels generate).

"Bare Essentials for 2-3 day Hike","1229","","<h2>My story</h2>

<p>I like to hike and pack light. Lately I have been experimenting with various setups for making a 2-3 day trek along the Appalachian Trail. I have tried a few different methods of carrying gear within different packs.
(I've used a <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0091CUDS2"" rel=""noreferrer"">KoolerTron</a>, <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00DEGUAXY"" rel=""noreferrer"">A.L.I.C.E</a> pack and <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00695698W"" rel=""noreferrer"">East German Pack</a>.)</p>

<p>By far; my favorite is my East German, followed By the Koolertron.
(I buy and use military, mostly, because I know it's rugged and will withstand my abuse.)</p>

<p>I like the East German pack because (once I changed the straps) it's comfortable, light, and waterproof, only downside is that it doesn't hold a lot.
The Koolertron is comfortable, but not waterproof, carries a moderate amount, but a bit heavy because it's made from thick cotton canvas.
The A.L.I.C.E made me feel like a pack mule.</p>

<p>These Latest three trials have taught me a few things about what I should and shouldn't take on my excursions.</p>

<p>My setup at current:</p>

<ol>
<li>2, 1.5ltr (Military) Canteens with cup inserts.</li>
<li>Light weight, compressible, sleeping bag (2lbs) by Eureka</li>
<li>A small Pouch that consist of, protein bars, a couple small cans of beans, crackers and tuna in a can.</li>
<li>Toiletries.</li>
<li>Feather-light, compressible, Hammock (By Grand Trunk).</li>
<li>50' of Para cording.</li>
<li>Knife.</li>
</ol>

<p>All of this is on a Military Suspender-harnes-like rig, so that if need be, I can also attach the East German Pack to include change of clothes, wet weather gear, pack more rations, or anything else.</p>

<h2>My Question</h2>

<p><strong>Does this sound like a well rounded, bare essential, 2-3 day trekking setup, if not what should I change?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>Please Keep in mind that I am not looking to purchase a new pack, especially if they are the New, thin-nylon ""Rip-stop"" light weight packs with, or without, frame support. I am simply asking about the gear in tow right now.<br><Br>
My Current Gear without/with Back pack<br>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iKun2.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>For a bare essential setup, you'll do just fine. You might want to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>Better food selection</li>
<li>Duct tape</li>
<li>Emergency kit</li>
<li>Light source</li>
<li>Change the water containers</li>
<li>Mini-carabiner</li>
</ul>

<p>Prefer non-canned goods because they are lighter, take less space and the resulting trash compacts better. You can find tuna packs too.</p>

<p>You can roll duct tape on your poles or bottle.</p>

<p>I carry a ziplock bag on me with some basic emergency items in it.</p>

<p>I would consider changing the water containers with a gatorade/smart-water bottle and perhaps bring a foldable container (platypus/evernew).</p>

"Calculate true north with a compass and map","1229","","<p>We've a map and a functional compass. A compass shows of course the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Magnetic_Pole"" rel=""noreferrer"">magnetic north</a> and the map provides us with the correct and current declination. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The North Magnetic Pole is the point on the surface of Earth's
  Northern Hemisphere at which the planet's magnetic field points
  vertically downwards (in other words, if a magnetic compass needle is
  allowed to rotate about a horizontal axis, it will point straight
  down).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How can I determine the more useful <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_north"" rel=""noreferrer"">true north</a>?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>True north (geodetic north) is the direction along the earth's surface
  towards the geographic North Pole.</p>
</blockquote>
","<p>There are several ways to determine true north, especially when you have a map and compass:<ol></p>

<p><li>Competent maps, like most intended for backcountry hiking, will have the magnetic declination marked.  This is usually in one of the corners.  Take a look at any USGS topo map, for example.</p>

<p>The compass will tell you the direction to magnetic north, and the map tells you what angle to add to that to get the direction to true north.</p>

<p><li>The magnetic declination is really something you should know anyway.  It's not going to change much over the range of a day hike or even a few nights backpacking.  1&deg;, for example, is still plenty close enough for trail navigation, and probably less than your error reading and aligning a compass anyway.</p>

<p>For example, where I am in north central Massachusetts, true north is about 14&frac12;&deg; right of magnetic.  In the white mountains of NH, it's about another degree more.  Even if it's two degrees more and I don't account for that, it's really not going to matter in a practical sense.</p>

<p><li>Use the map at a known point and line it up with another known point in the distance.  If you are where you can see a decent distance, you almost certainly can see some landmarks you can also find on the map.  Or you just recognize them because you know something about the area or were paying attention as you got to wherever you are.  You always known <i>something</i>.</p>

<p>Once you have the map oriented, you look at the compass and find the magnetic declination.  Now you remember that for future reference anywhere in that general area.</p>

<p><li>Use the usual ways to find a bearing without a map or compass.  This includes looking at the sun angle at a known time of day, or the north star at night.</p>

<p><li>General rule for the contiguous 48 US states: Keep in mind that the magnetic north pole is usually off the coast of Baffin island in the Canadian arctic.  In the middle of the country, it lines up nicely with true north.  In the east (like NH), true north will be about 15&deg; right of magnetic, and in the west (like Yosemite) about 15&deg; left of magnetic.  In the middle, like St Louis, it's close to 0.  Mentally interpolate in between.  Maybe use 17&deg; left in WA, 7&deg; right in FL, etc.  You may be off by 5&deg;, but again, that's close enough for practical purposes.</p>

<p>And keep in mind that North America is the toughest because that's where the magnetic pole is.  The variation across Siberia will be less than the variation across the northern US over the same distance.  Again, don't worry about every last degree.</p>

<p></ol></p>

<p>Keep the need for accuracy in mind.  &plusmn;5&deg; (or even more) is good enough for wilderness navigation.  If you know there is a river to the east, it's not really going to matter whether you set off on a heading of 85&deg; or 95&deg;.  It's much more important to keep watching distant landmarks to avoid going in circles.</p>

"How can I keep my backpack safe?","1225","","<p>I went on a hike with my wife the other day in Norcal. This place had a creek that led into a cave that you can swim in. We both left our backpacks at the cave entrance and then swam through it to the other side to explore, trusting that no one would steal our stuff. All the while though we were worrying some about our back packs which had our money, keys and phone. But our stuff was ok and all there when we got back.</p>

<p>What can we do to keep our backpack safe the next time and so we don't worry as much when we have to leave it for a while? </p>

<p>I did a search online but wasn't completely satisfied. I was hoping there was some type of deterrent device you can set inside your backpack so when its moved a loud alarm goes off. Is there such a thing? The other thought was taking money keys and phone with us but in this particular situation even if we carry a waterproof fanny pack there is still the danger of it falling and/or getting lost, especially in a partly dark cave. Any suggestions?</p>

<p>We are newbies to Outdoor activities like these.</p>
","<p>Hide your pack or move it a bit off the trail. Make sure you do not overdo it and end up not being able to find it back yourself. :-) Although you are in the wood, if you are in a popular area, it is possible that other local visit the same area.</p>

<p>I've never heard of people bringing alarms for their bags and don't recommend it. I doubt it will be of any help if somebody decides to steal an <em>abandoned</em> backpack. It is also a possible unpleasant noise that <a href=""http://lnt.org/teach/cell-phone-use-guidance"">does not belong in the <em>wild</em></a>. Please no car alarms backpackers :-).</p>

<p>Personally, I use a small <a href=""http://www.zpacks.com/accessories/stuff_sacks.shtml"">wallet pouch</a> or <a href=""http://www.loksak.com/products/aloksak"">water proof bag</a> that I carry at all times. In it you will find one personal identification card, one credit card or bank card and a single bill in case of emergency. Sometimes I will also have a single key (car or home). I also carry a small emergency kit on me in case an accident happens.</p>

<p>This has actually been proven useful once after our team separated ourselves from our bags/equipement for a side trail. One person had a head injury (a bump on the head in the small <a href=""http://www.afar.com/highlights/a-blessing-from-the-hundred-rupee-monk"">hundred rupee monk</a> house that led to a fair amount of bleeding; lets just say that the blessing was short lived!). Having the emergency kit on me instead of my backpack helped a lot.</p>

<p>When you separate yourself from your bag, it is important to have something in case you don't find back your bag or cannot get back to your bag. You can usually anchor your wallet pouch to your pants to prevent accidentally dropping it. Many <em>hiking pants</em> have either zippers or loops that you can attach items to using a <a href=""http://www.zpacks.com/accessories/carabiner.shtml"">mini D-carabiner</a> for example.</p>

<p>Some people enjoy money belts that goes around the neck. This is similar to a fanny pack but <a href=""http://www.artoftravel.com/08thieves.htm"">slightly different alternatives exist</a> if you are interested in this option.</p>

<p>Happy trails!</p>

"How do I pack a mummy type sleeping bag in a M10 or M28 haversack?","1223","","<p>It is fairly easy to pack a blanket or a small sleeping bag in a haversack, but in cold weather, one would sometimes like to have a warmer bag.  A mummy type sleeping bag usually does not roll up easily, and it is somewhat hard to pack it.  Does anybody know a good way how to pack such a sleeping bag in M10 or M28?</p>
","<p>I guess it all depends on the pack size of your mummy sleeping bag. Typically army issues haversacks have dimensions of anything ranging between 12x12"" to 13""x18"" (30x30cm and 33x45cm). If the compression bag that comes with the sleeping bag does not fit when you place it in the haversack, you could use a different compression sack where you could change the dimensions of the pack size to fit the bag. But you will be lucky as most of the cheaper mummy bags typically compress to the size of the bag you want to place it in or larger.</p>

<p>My recommendation would be to buy a different maybe a more compact and light sleeping bag which will fit better. But depending on your budget, say something like <a href=""http://www.snugpak.com/index.php?MenuID=114-119"" rel=""nofollow"">Snugpac Softie Technic 2/3</a> would be good. I'm sure with a little bit of searching you could find a cheaper one. </p>

"Diet for Long-Term Camping","1221","","<p>I will be camping and commuting to work for some undetermined number of months. During this time, I plan to do a lot of working out as well, and I'm wondering what healthy camp-friendly mostly non-perishables are there for this kind of lifestyle. A lot of what I've seen has a tremendous amount of sodium, or isn't very diverse (i.e. not a lot of fruits and vegetables), being  mostly bars and granola.</p>

<p>Also, I do plan to do campfire cooking, but would like my doing so to be a matter of choice rather than necessity. Or, to be able to cook large batches of food on the weekends to last the week.</p>

<p>To get to the various campsites, I will drive and park in a nearby lot. I'm aiming to have the campsite within a 20 minute hike of the parking spot. There are various grocery stores within 20 minutes of the parking site as well. Additionally, I have a lunchbox size fridge space available at work to store a minimal amount. Work is about 20 minutes away from the park site.</p>
","<p>Stews based on fresh vegetables and pulses (dried or tinned) are as healthy as you like and can be made from only shelf-stable ingredients. With the addition of potatoes or pearl barley you can cook a meal in one pot, over a fire or camping stove without much control. Sauces can be based on beer/wine/tomatoes/coconut milk etc. Rice or pasta on the side, or fresh bread if you have access to it, can make a nice change.  </p>

<p>One example might be red lentil dhal: fry an onion and some garlic, add spices, a tin of tomatoes, red lentils and water. Simmer until the lentils are soft and the dish has thickened. Serve with rice. </p>

<p>You may be used to keeping fresh vegetables in the fridge, but in many cases it's not necessary. </p>

<p>By varying the flavours such as herbs and spices you can make a wide variety of foods, which is more appealing than the same thing every day.</p>

<p>If you like meat, there are dishes like corned beef hash, or you can add cured sausage or even jerky to stews or pasta sauces. But tinned fish is probably better if you're concerned about sodium.</p>

<p>Baking potatoes or sweet potatoes in a campfire is another long established practice. </p>

<p>Another idea, especially for when it's too warm to want stew or similar: Eggs. I know you have to refrigerate eggs your side of the Atlantic but they'll still keep for the time it takes you to get them to your camp (as will a measured quantity of cheese or cooked meat, with the rest of the pack stored in your tiny bit of work fridge). You can then make an omelette or scrambled eggs, to have with a salad or baked potato. </p>

"Handling IT-Band Syndrome when hiking","1219","","<p>A few weeks ago I was hit by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliotibial_band_syndrome"" rel=""nofollow"">IT-Band syndrome</a>. I know that rest is paramount in healing it but the problem is that you do not know if it has fully healed.</p>

<p>In a few days, I want to go on a 2 day hike. Right now, I am pretty confident that I can hike for 15-20 km without any pain.</p>

<p>Do you have any tips for when the IT band pain hits me right in the middle of the trip? </p>

<p>Streches that help, walking methods to alleviate the pain or outright help prevent IT band syndrome?</p>
","<p>As general rule a physical assessment is necessary as it can be the result of compensation for other problems (flat feet or hyperlordosis for example, just to name a couple). The treatment involves stretching the Iliotibial Band itself (eventual thickening cant be reduced that way but the ITB is attached to muscles so stretching that has a direct effect on those), taking care of the muscles and trigger points that refer to the area and a series of stretching and strengthening exercises, but they would do nothing if the causes aren't addressed properly.
Recent studies have changed a bit the traditional belief that ITB syndrome is due to friction. They have shown that it might be associated with the compression of an highly vascularized and innervated fat pad between knee and ITB or a damage to the Periosteum (the outer layer of tissue covering the bone) at the ITB attachment. 
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1pi1j.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1pi1j.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>
This doesn't mean a complete treatment change but it can point the finger to other structures as the real source of pain. Knowing that helps developing treatment programs that can be much more effective.</p>

<p>Posture, gait, footwear etc need to be assessed, a full health history taken to rule out other conditions with similar symptoms and pinpoint the causes of the problem. General stretches are never a waste but they might do very little to help solving your problem if they don't address the real cause, which isnt the same for everyone, so in here you will get just a very general answer.</p>

<p>As a suggestion yoga could be considered as a way to increase flexibility, the benefits of it are several and many find it a perfect complement to their main activity.</p>

<p>The easiest ITB stretch is the lean with the help of a wall:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GGMTI.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GGMTI.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a> (the one you are stretching is the one facing the wall btw). Stretch both sides. Many pictures in internet show a lean that is way too exaggerated, that ends focusing on other structures rather than the ITB and the position is not stable enough to be a safe remedial exercise. Stretches are often improperly done missing their target structure, they need to be shown, then the patient would perform them and be corrected so that they can be useful, the picture above is an indication but you will have a better outcome working with a proper medical practitioner. This stretch is rarely prescribed alone, stretching all the other muscles of the leg/hips/back (and strengthening some) is needed, but these will have to be specific for your situation.</p>

<p>Manage inflammation, through cold rinses or ice after every activity while causes are getting addressed properly (that is just for the inflammation, it doesn't fix your ITB problem). Avoid repeated use of anti inflammatory drugs as they just mask the symptoms and lead to a chronic problem.</p>

<p>IF your work involves sitting a lot, that aggravates the situation, try to stretch regularly during the day.</p>

<p>Some suggest rolling the ITB (using various kind of rollers or even a tennis ball), that's hit and miss, the way a therapist would actively work on the ITB is a bit different and it needs to be done at an angle, with whats shown online (pressure square on the ITB) you are benefiting more the surrounding muscles, which can alleviate a bit the pain, but does little for the ITB itself.</p>

<p>Following OP request I searched for a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOLBRhrF4Kc"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">video</a> showing the right way to use the roller, this one shows the main part of the whole exercise (it doesn't show rolling across the ITB). <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOLBRhrF4Kc"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOLBRhrF4Kc</a><br>
The study he is talking about is <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16533314"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Fairclough, et al. 2006</a></p>

<p>Be careful when rolling, some rollers are aggressive, and a ball is even more aggressive (the smaller and harder the worse). Its best to start learning the exercise with something gentle and then progress to something more aggressive. Some people that did things wrong (too fast, too slow, for too long, too aggressive, wrong roller, wrong position...) ended with some bad bruising.</p>

<p>Your goal should be not only managing the problem but resolving it so that it doesn't become chronic. A chronic problem not only keeps recurring and aggravating but also starts to involve neighbouring structures. </p>

<p>Some things you can do by yourself but you will obtain real results much faster if you see a therapist (a GOOD one).</p>

<p>Its also beneficial to use trekking poles, it helps to reduce the impact force going through the knee, even more if you tend to ""stomp"" on your heel while hiking.</p>

<p>There are ""ITB straps"", you can quickly find them online, that helped some people with ITBS, the problem with these is that they can quickly become a crutch and they don't cure anything. 
Remember that the longer the problem presents itself the longer it takes to recover, so plain symptoms management can be counterproductive. </p>

"Slings for anchoring and lanyard in rock climbing","1217","","<p>Probably common question, but: What slings do you use to build anchors for belaying the 2nd in rock climbing? Dyneema or nylon?</p>

<p>I had discussed this problem with my friend and he said that Dyneema is better as it has greater strength ratio and other characteristics (but it's not important).</p>

<p>As I know and had remain DMM's tests (<a href=""http://dmmclimbing.com/knowledge/how-to-break-nylon-dyneema-slings/"">HOW TO BREAK NYLON &amp; DYNEEMA® SLINGS</a> and <a href=""http://dmmclimbing.com/knowledge/slings-at-anchors/"">SLINGS AT ANCHORS [VID]</a>), nylon has better fall absorption, so, I would use these slings on anchors and lanyard when belaying.</p>
","<p>While both materials do have slightly different properties, either one will work in the scenario mentioned. In-fact, any sling with the <a href=""http://www.theuiaa.org/upload_area/files/1/Rweb_Slings.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">UIAA stamp of approval</a> will likely have a working strength of 22kn - more force than you will ever be able to generate by falling <strong>if being belayed by a rope</strong>.</p>

<p>The latter part is important, because the rope (among other things) is what will absorb the energy of your fall in this scenario, not the sling. Again, just to elaborate: Your rope is designed to catch the impact of your fall, a sling is not. In the videos presented by DMM you can see what happens when the sling is forced to absorb the impact of a fall, and it's not pretty. </p>

<p>The question of what material to choose from will depend on the conditions more than anything else. Materials like Dyneema are lighter, and won't absorb as much water as Nylon in wet weather, making them the ideal choice for applications where weight or weather is a primary concern, like mountaineering for example. They also have the lowest melting point from all the climbing fabrics though, so will probably need replacing sooner.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Aramids (Technora, Kevlar etc..) can be just as strong, and have the highest melting point of most materials, upwards of 500C celcius. This makes them perfect for those long rappels, or hauling and rescue scenarios like firefighting. They also happen to have a much worse shelf life when it comes to UV degradation (from exposure to the sun) however. Nylons fall somewhere in between on both counts.</p>

<p>Ultimately, any UIAA approved sling can be expected to hold the force of a falling second when being belayed by a rope; and if switching leads, you can always use the climbing rope itself to tie an anchor also.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/67WDm.jpg"" alt=""Climbing Rope Anchor""></p>

<p>Here is a link to the properties of some common materials as further reading: <a href=""http://www.marlowropes.com/technical/physical-properties.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.marlowropes.com/technical/physical-properties.html</a></p>

<p>Beyond material properties, additional preferences will come from application, and which fabric will be easier to work with. For example, knots are easier to untie from thicker material, so Nylon will be a better choice if you are putting in lots of knots.</p>

"Divers deliberately breathing fast before diving into water","1210","","<p>I have seen a few divers who practiced breathing fast before a dive. What good does it do?</p>

<ul>
<li>Does deliberate/forced hyperventilation help to hold breathe over long time?</li>
<li>Is there a connection in the same technique and Some breathing practices in yoga?</li>
</ul>
","<p>Divers do this in an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apnea#Hyperventilation""><strong>attempt</strong> to saturate their blood with Oxygen before diving</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Voluntary hyperventilation before beginning voluntary apnea is
  commonly believed to allow the person involved to safely hold their
  breath for a longer period. <strong>In reality, it will give the impression
  that one does not need to breathe, while the body is actually
  experiencing a blood-oxygen level that would normally, and indirectly,
  invoke a strong dyspnea.</strong> Some have incorrectly attributed the effect
  of hyperventilation to increased oxygen in the blood, not realizing
  that it is actually due to a decrease in CO2 in the blood and lungs.
  Blood leaving the lungs is normally fully saturated with oxygen, so
  hyperventilation of normal air cannot increase the amount of oxygen
  available. Lowering the CO2 concentration increases the pH of the
  blood, thus increasing the time before the respiratory center becomes
  stimulated, as described above. While hyperventilation will yield
  slightly longer breath-holding times, any small time increase is at
  the expense of possible hypoxia. One using this method can suddenly
  lose consciousness—a shallow water blackout—as a result. If a person
  loses consciousness underwater, there is considerable danger that they
  will drown. An alert diving partner would be in the best position to
  rescue such a person. Static apnea blackout occurs at the surface when
  a motionless diver holds a breath long enough for the circulating
  oxygen to fall below that required for the brain to maintain
  consciousness. It involves no pressure changes in the body and is
  usually performed to enhance breath-hold time. It should never be
  practiced alone, but under strict safety protocols with a safety

"How can I prevent animals from marking my camp as their territory?","1206","","<p>Often, when I leave my tent during the day, cats and other animals come and pee in the corners and on the carpet. They probably do this to mark it as their territory. They don't come at night when I sleep inside. </p>

<p>Besides building a fence around my tent, which is expensive and time-consuming, is there other way to convince animals that they shouldn't come?</p>
","<p>I assume that the way the said animal is marking it's territory, and with reference to ""<em>They don't come at night when I sleep inside.</em>"", can I assume that you are camping there more than a night or two? If thats the case then I am hoping that its not a backcountry area where you have bears.</p>

<p>Marking the territory in the sense you are talking of definitely suggest that you're referring to domestic and more or less harmless animals, cats and dogs being the ideal examples. Assuming the way of marking the territory, we are not talking of big wild animals like Bears and Coyotes, etc.
So, as far as the cats and dogs are concerned, No matter what, Your best bet to keep tent as your <em>territory</em> should be zipping it neat when you go out and its unattended.</p>

<p>Yet, if you are looking for some thing that can keep them away, probably odors are best bet to bank upon: Apart from peeing around own tent, there are a few tricks to work it around.</p>

<ol>
<li>You can use a room freshener with a  strong fragrance, that shall help you keep the dogs and cats away. Most of them are irritated by strong odors.</li>
<li>If the room freshener for some reason is unacceptable to you, then you can try for something like putting mothballs into a Net-pouch, that can keep many insects and dogs away. That works for my dog, (<em>Though we never intentionally try to keep her away from us, or out of our territory, she is always with us!</em>)</li>
<li>I've observed that such animals tend to occupy the corners. So if I were you, I would try and keep some stuff at the corners, but this really doesn't work on almost every situation though, at least never keep your bedding at the corners, they would really get tempted to take a nap there and often try coming in and snuggle. Instead, if its a cat (and not a dog for sure) you can keep your shoes or some other footwear (spare one of course if you carry along) at the corners, most of the cats tend to hate them, while dogs would love them. Keep the stuff at the corner, whatever stuff that won't make an animal feel cozy and comfy.
My pet, she loves sleeping on (and fortunately not inside) my sleeping bag and she does that all the time.</li>

"Things to consider when approaching deer","1205","","<p>I often approach deer to see how near I can get and to watch them (just for fun - not to hunt). I take care for the wind and of course to be silent enough. </p>

<p>What else should one consider stalking/approaching deer? </p>
","<p>The biggest things are scent, movement and not seeing what the deer can see. Most people trying to approach a deer are not seeing the forest, field, meadow or whatever, as the deer sees it. Crouch down so your head is about 2-3 feet lower than normal, and the world looks different. You see different paths through the brush, and a lot of times you discover that you thought you were hidden, but you were exposed and there's almost a viewing portal between you and the deer. One of the most enlightening experiences I had was pushing into a thicket up in the mountains that was so many acres in size, so thickly overgrown, that I had to get on my hands and knees and crawl for an hour on game trails to get through it. The world looks different on deer level.</p>

<p>Other times, just movement and projecting a calmness. I've sat on a log after coming back from a run, in the snow, just sat down and stayed still, out in the open and had 7-8 deer come out and feed up right to within about 15 feet. They all saw me, knew I was there, but I just sat there smiling and still, and enjoying the moment. Was hard to do, I had decided I was going to run bare chested, so I sat there in the snow with no shirt on, freezing my rear off. Maybe they figured I was freezing to death and was no threat? But I believe animals can sense intentions as well as detect them (via pheromones as much as movement, speed, etc).</p>

<p>Practice catching armadillos and sneaking up on squirrels, you'll learn a lot. As a teenager, my buddies and I would see who could snatch the most armadillos up by their tail in open fields at night. They have ridiculously good hearing, but poor eyesight. You learn how to sneak having to constantly reposition yourself to get in their path, as they rarely root around in a straight line. Then, you have to either at the last moment find a way to get behind them or let them walk almost right into your feet. When you or they get close enough, you reach down and grab them by the tail and snatch them up (be sure to hold them stiff armed, at arms length, away from your body...those claws allow them to burrow into the ground in seconds for a reason). And sneaking up on squirrels...hard to do, but it's entertaining to see their reaction.</p>

<p>On the movement, timing is important. Not just moving when something isn't looking your way, but your movement pattern. Don't take two steps or four. Take one or three, and then a pause. Four legged critters don't move in the same sequence as us bipedal types. Even if they can't see you, if you're close, they probably hear you. They can be looking away from you and know you're a threat because they heard a movement that isn't a norm in the woods. And off they go.</p>

<p>A lot of times, if you jump up a bedded buck he jumps up and looks around. If you had the wind in your favor, maybe he's heard your movement, but doesn't know where you are exactly. Even if he doesn't see you, instinct tells him to take off because he heard a wrongness in the movement he heard, so off he bounds. Then, sometimes, if you snapped a twig or made some obvious or even loud noise and jump one up, they might look around and then sort of quickly walk off as opposed to running/bounding. He's probably decided that the noise startled him, but he hasn't seen you, and the noise wasn't 'wrong' but it's best to go anyway, because you never know. That's how bucks grow to be big bucks.</p>

"What kind of baby carrier is best for use walking and climbing in the hills?","1200","","<p>I'm going to be a Dad for the first time early next year.

I've started looking at a baby carrier so we can take our wee one out on short walks and for me when I take our dogs out for a walk (which I do a couple of times a day). </p>

<p>I want a carrier as we live quite rural and a lot of the places I go on a day to day basis have no pavements, etc. So a pram simply won't be practical. I also often climb the local hills and I'd like to take the baby with me occasionally. </p>

<li><p>Walking in low country</p></li>
</ul>

<p>What kind of carrier should I be looking for? What features do I want, which are over kill and which are required?</p>
","<p>All our kids have been coming on hikes with us since they were newborns. We have two types of baby carrying hiking packs, two more snuggly baby carriers, and a variety of baby wraps.</p>

<p>The answer to your question is to carry the kid in the carrier suitable for their size and age. When your baby is brand new and can't sit up on it's own, then you should carry it in a wrap, after it gets to about 6 months old, then you can carry them in a back pack. </p>

<p>We had our pack and a couple snuggly carriers before we got our first baby wrap. I highly recommend getting a wrap first, the babies like them much better because they keep their arms and legs tucked in and hold their heads too. They literally just sleep the whole time when they're in the wrap. </p>

<p>When they get bigger you can move them into the backpacks. We were hiking this year with my 4 and 2 year old both in backpacks, that way my wife and I could have a good hike without having to wait for littles to keep up, or listen to them complain about being tired. </p>

<p>But for a brand new baby, you definitely want to go with a wrap like this one:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ux2Il.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ux2Il.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>They're very versatile, they keep the baby up close to your centre of gravity, they're comfortable for you and the baby, and you can wear a backpack over top of them. After that, invest in a nice comfy hiking backpack for the kid.</p>

<p>The one I have comes with a hood and a full rain cover, so I can basically take my kids hiking with me in any weather.</p>

"What does lumen and lux for flashlights/torches actually mean?","1196","","<p>Most torches have their brightness specified in lumen, sometimes one also sees a lux number, at times both. While the technical meaning of these units are clear (lumen is luminous intensity per steradian, lux luminous intens. per area, see wikipedia for more details), it is unclear how these numbers are measured.</p>

<p>Torches usually have one or several light sources plus reflectors and lenses, resulting in a light beam that differs from model to model and is spatially inhomogeneous. Thus the lamp as a whole is not really a point light source.</p>

<p>What does the lumen number refer to?</p>

<p>The lux number is conceptually easier, as it does not require a point source and could be measured at any point of the light beam. However it probably is along the central beam axis.</p>

<p>Is there an agreed upon position/method to measure these values (in between manufacturers)?</p>
","<p>From <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/8274/why-might-one-need-a-2000-lumen-headlamp/8278#8278"">a related post</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumen_(unit)"" rel=""noreferrer"">Lumens</a></strong> is the SI unit for luminous flux, which is essentially the total amount of light in the visible spectrum emitted by a source in all directions. Lumens does <em>not</em> depend on distance from the light source, because it must be measured in all directions. A related unit, lux, measures the amount of light hitting a certain surface area, and <em>is</em> dependent on distance. 1&nbsp;lux = 1&nbsp;lm/m<sup>2</sup>. If you were to measure the lux on every surface of an imaginary sphere around a light source and add it up, you would get the total lumens output of the device. No matter what the diameter of the sphere, you would get the same number of lumens. As you increase the diameter, the brightness on any given surface is lower, but the surface area you must measure increases. </p>
  
  <p>It turns out this is almost exactly how you measure lumens in real life - with a scientific instrument called an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrating_sphere"" rel=""noreferrer"">integrating sphere</a>. An integrating sphere uses a highly diffuse coating to evenly disperse light inside a sphere. All light entering through the sample port bounces around so many times that the brightness is nearly even at any point on the surface of the sphere. A photodetector, typically a radiometer, measures the intensity of the light received at the exit port across all visible wavelengths, then sums the intensities to determine the total luminous flux. Below is a photo of the integrating sphere I used to conduct testing of bike lights: </p>
  
  <p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MJqAP.jpg"" alt=""Integrating sphere""></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Lux</strong> can be measured with a low-cost hand-held light meter. Of course, an accurate and calibrated meter costs more. Lux is lm/m<sup>2</sup>; in other words, how much light hits a particular area. Lux meters collect light from an aperture of a known size, typically about 1&nbsp;in<sup>2</sup>. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/I4RoEm.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/I4RoEm.jpg"" alt=""lux meter""></a></p>

<p>You state that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The lux number is conceptually easier, as it does not require a point source and could be measured at any point of the light beam. However it probably is along the central beam axis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lux <em>does</em> depend on position, because it's light <em>per area</em>. The further you get from the light source the more the light beam has diffused, so the less light hits a particular area, as illustrated by this drawing from Wikipedia: </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/a0wDr.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/a0wDr.png"" alt=""Inverse square law applied to lux""></a></p>

<p><strong>Candela</strong> is the unit for a point measurement which doesn't depend on the distance. Candelas are inversely proportional to the square of lux. You can convert lux to candela using the inverse square law: <code>candela = lux * (d)^2</code> where <em>d</em> is the distance in meters from the light source. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there an agreed upon position/method to measure these values (in between manufacturers)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, there is. The <strong><a href=""http://webstore.ansi.org/RecordDetail.aspx?sku=ANSI%2FNEMA%20FL%201-2009"" rel=""noreferrer"">ANSI FL1 Standard</a></strong> was developed by the flashlight industry in 2009 and specifies particular measurement techniques and testing conditions. The standard includes test methods for beam distance (derived from lux), peak beam intensity (candelas at the center/brightest spot of the beam), battery run time, light output, and other features like impact resistance and water resistance. It also specifies standard icons and marketing guidelines to ensure consistent information is available to consumers. Here is a summary of the markings and their associated meanings, from Streamlight: </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/RgtQx.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/RgtQx.jpg"" alt=""FL1 Standard markings""></a></p>

<p>Not all manufacturers follow the FL1 standard, although most reputable ones do. Some have their own testing process which is similar, while others simply make up numbers to sound good so they can sell lots of crappy products to poorly informed consumers. Certainly be skeptical of outrageous claims, especially if the product doesn't have FL1 Standard markings on the packaging or website. </p>

<p>Also, note that device characteristics can significantly affect actual output compared to specifications. In particular: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Losses from internal reflection, passing through lenses, and other factors of the optical design can significantly reduce the useful light output compared to the raw output from the LED emitter. Higher quality lights typically use more expensive optical glass and carefully design their reflectors to minimize these losses. Cheap products use simple plastic. The FL1 Standard requires testing the fully assembled light, but some less honest manufacturers will publish the emitter lumens rating rather than the actual useful light levels. </p></li>
<li><p>LEDs get less efficient as they get warm. Lights with poor thermal management will get dimmer as you use them. This is typically not reflected in the specifications, but is sometimes brought up in independent reviews. </p></li>
<li><p>Batteries and circuitry within the light play a big role too. As a battery drains down, its voltage drops. At lower voltages, LEDs put out less light. Good lights have voltage regulators to keep the brightness up even when the battery gets low, and to step the brightness down only once the battery can no longer supply enough voltage even with the regulator. Other lights will just get dimmer through the runtime. </p></li>
<li><p>There are also an increasing number of counterfeit LEDs now. Cree is the most well-known LED manufacturer and has the highest performing LEDs. A lot of very cheap generic lights advertised as containing Cree LEDs actually have knock-offs which don't work as well. Worse yet, rechargeable lithium batteries included in many cheap lights are often unsafe and rarely have the capacity advertised. </p></li>

","<p>You covered it already—layers. This is actually a very common technique among ultralight backpackers.

If you need to get warm fast, you can do some sit-ups to get your blood moving.</p>

<p>You only need to worry about sweating if you overinsulate. The form of insulation (sleeping bag or clothing) won't make a difference. In fact, having more layers gives you more flexibility so you can adjust your insulation level depending on the actual conditions.

"How to create a cast or splint to aid a broken bone?","1192","","<p>Assuming you or one of your party has broken his leg (or something). How can you create a provisional splint or cast to bring you/him/her back to the next hospital etc.?</p>

<p>Would be cool if it's made out of natural materials but common camping equipment is also suitable. </p>
","<p>A cast is meant to promote long-term healing of a broken bone, and getting a cast typically requires a doctor in a definitive care environment. A splint is the preferred treatment for fractures and sprains in the field. The purpose of a splint is to immobilize the limb around the injury. A good splint should be well padded, comfortable for the patient, and sufficiently tight to immobilize the joint without cutting off circulation distal to the splint. </p>

<p>Where you should apply the splint depends on where the injury is. If the injury is on the bone, you should immobilize the joints distal (further from the core of the body) and proximal (closer to the core of the body) to the injury. If the injury is on the joint, you should immobilize the bones distal and proximal to the injury. The idea is to prevent movement at the site of the injury by immobilizing the limb around it. </p>

<h1>Before splinting</h1>

<h2>Fracture types</h2>

<p>If there is a fracture, determine if the fracture is closed or compound, and check for angulation. A closed fracture is one where the bone does not break the skin; a compound fracture is when the bone has broken the skin. An angulated fracture is one where the bone is no longer straight. A compound fracture will almost always be the result of an angulated fracture, but a closed fracture can also be angulated and is at risk of becoming open. An angulated fracture can pinch nerves or blood vessels, resulting in intense pain at the fracture, reduced sensation distal to the injury, and loss of circulation. Therefore, it is recommended to apply traction in line (TIL) if possible. TIL involves pulling slowly but firmly to separate the bones at the point of the fracture, then returning the limb to its anatomical position. If you meet resistance, do not force it. It can sometimes take a couple minutes of gentle traction. TIL should not be applied to a severely angulated or shattered bone.</p>

<p>TIL can be used with arms and lower legs. A femur fracture is much more serious due to the potential for blood loss from the femoral artery. Once traction is applied to a fractured femur it must not be removed until the patient reaches definitive care, and therefore requires a traction splint. Traction splints are difficult to improvise in the field, and there is some disagreement among wilderness medicine educators on whether traction splints should be applied as first aid.</p>

<h2>Wound treatment</h2>

<p>Once traction has been applied if necessary/possible, treat any cuts or bleeding around the injury as you would for any other soft tissue injury. If there is an open fracture, it's imperative to thoroughly clean the wound to avoid infection, especially if your evacuation is likely to take a long time. Infection management is often overlooked in first aid, and a little time taken to thoroughly clean and dress a wound up front will pay dividends later. If any portion of bone is still exposed, cover it with a sterile dressing, ideally moistened with iodine solution, and take extra care to thoroughly pad around the bone when building the splint later. </p>

<h2>Patient assessment</h2>

<p>This is somewhat beyond the scope of this question, but patient care extends far beyond just fixing the most obvious problem. Make sure to check the patient for any other injuries &ndash; an obvious and painful injury like a broken bone can distract the patient from less obvious but potentially threatening injuries. Learn the patient assessment system, monitor your patient's vital signs, and make sure you aren't overlooking any other problems. You also need to make sure to manage your patient's environment while treating their injuries. Don't get so focused on building a splint that you don't notice that your patient is shivering and rapidly progressing towards hypothermia. Getting on a pad, and under a tarp or in a tent before progressing to splinting is always a good idea.</p>

<h1>Splinting</h1>

<h2>Arm splint</h2>

<h3>Preparing materials</h3>

<p>After treating any wounds, you can now start building a splint. Remember that the splint should be comfortable, but also needs to completely immobilize above and below the point of injury. Make sure the patient's fingers remain accessible so that you can check their circulation and sensation after applying the splint. </p>

<p>You will need a semi-solid structure to form the splint, as well as a lot of padding and wrapping materials. Arm splints and leg splints are generally approached differently, and you always have to improvise for the specific situation. I'll start by describing a standard arm splint. For almost any outing where I know I'll be more than an hour or two from definitive care I carry a SAM splint, which is a thin piece of aluminum covered by foam. The splint becomes very rigid when bent along the long axis to form a V, but is pliable enough when flat to conform to the shape of an arm and wrap around elbows. You can improvise with other materials &ndash; try to find wide flat objects rather than small narrow objects like tent poles.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5YRej.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5YRej.jpg"" alt=""SAM splint""></a></p>

<p>For padding you can typically use extra clothes. Use the patient's clothes if they're available, because you probably won't get yours back! Fluffy items like fleece or down jackets are good &ndash; they're comfortable, can conform to unusual shapes, and will also prevent the limb from getting cold (since it won't fit in a jacket very well once it's all splinted up!). For wrapping materials I usually carry a couple of ACE bandages in my first aid kit, but in a pinch you could tear up any stretchy fabric like a T-shirt. The wrapping material should be stretchy and wide, to distribute pressure evenly. Don't use cord, as it will apply pressure in a very narrow line, causing discomfort and possible reduction of circulation. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Mc9ns.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Mc9ns.jpg"" alt=""ACE wrap""></a></p>

<p>You'll also need to fashion a sling. Triangle bandages (a.k.a. cravats) are commonly used for this, or can be improvised from a T-shirt or other materials. </p>

<h3>Building the splint</h3>

<p>Once you have your supplies ready, you can start building the splint. Size the SAM splint or other rigid material to the person's arm. You want the rigid material to cover the section you're immobilizing. For the forearm, you would put the splint up to the person's fingers and just below the elbow. For the elbow, you would place the elbow at a comfortable angle, then go from part way down the forearm to part way up the upper arm. You can use the patient's good arm to size the splint, assuming they're roughly symmetrical. </p>

<p>Now get your padding prepared and fold it such that the SAM splint or other rigid material is covered and the excess padding is hanging off the long side. Gently place the splint on the bottom side of the arm, then wrap the excess padding around the top. If it doesn't go all the way around, or the padding seems too thin, add more. Make sure to use the padding to fill any gaps between the arm and the rigid material. </p>

<p>Once the padding is in place, wrap the wrapping material around the entire splint bundle, proximal to distal (from near the body towards the fingers). Check with your patient as you go to ensure that the pressure feels comfortable. You don't want the limb to be to flex within the splint, but you also don't want to cut off circulation. You can check capillary refill in their fingernails by pressing on the whites and seeing how long it takes to recolorize in order to monitor circulation. </p>

<p>The splint should now have that section secured. You next need to create a sling to fix the arm in place so it won't droop or swing around. Tie a knot at the tip of a triangular bandage. The knotted end should wrap around the elbow, and the long ends of the triangle should be drawn up around the shoulders and tied off behind the neck. For your patient's comfort, place some padding on their neck under the knot &ndash; a spare hat or glove works well here. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KYo6H.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KYo6H.jpg"" alt=""Sling with cravat""></a></p>

<p>Finally, wrap a second sling around the person's torso (under the working armpit and around the disabled arm) to prevent the arm from swinging forward. Your patient should be able to stand up, lean forward, and rotate their torso without any movement of the disabled arm. Check again to ensure good circulation at the finger tips. </p>

<p>Here's an example of a well-built full splint:</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/osuadventureeducation/9309885639/in/album-72157634682819673/"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WMtDk.jpg"" alt=""Arm splint""></a></p>

<h2>Lower leg splint</h2>

<p>Splinting a lower leg fracture requires very similar supplies to an arm splint, with slight variations. The same principles of applying TIL and treating any soft tissue injuries apply. </p>

<p>Rather than a smaller rigid material like a SAM splint, you can use a standard sleeping pad. In my opinion, the leg splint is a bit easier than the arm splint, but it's harder to explain with words &ndash; see the photo below for step-by-step pictures, from this nice <a href=""https://wildernessmedicinenewsletter.wordpress.com/2008/02/18/lower-leg-splint/"" rel=""noreferrer"">article from the wilderness medicine newsletter</a>. You will need:</p>

<ul>
<li>A foam sleeping pad</li>
<li>At least three (and preferably 5) pieces of webbing, cravats, or other wide material to wrap around the splint</li>
<li>A longer piece of webbing, accessory cord, rope, or cravat to secure the bottom of the splint</li>
<li>Lots of padding</li>
</ul>

<p>As with the arm splint, the padding should be used to fill any gaps between the pad and the leg. You should also remove the patient's shoes and socks to allow easy access to check circulation in their feet, but keep the socks handy so you can cover the tip of the toe when you don't need direct access &ndash; don't want them to get hypothermia!</p>

<p>The idea is to use the pad to form the rigid exterior of the splint, folding the end of the pad over the foot to form a secure bottom section:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/m93SN.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/m93SN.jpg"" alt=""Leg splint directions""></a></p>

<p>A patient with a leg fracture will typically be unable to walk without assistance. In the case of a closed inline fracture they may be able to walk, but this increases the risk of completely breaking the bone and causing a much worse angulated fracture. Litter evacuation is preferred for a fractured leg. I've written an answer about <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/5924/makeshift-stretchers/5928#5928"">makeshift stretchers</a> (which is really about why you should just wait for somebody with a real litter to arrive, but I digress). </p>

<h1>A word on equipment</h1>

<p>Wilderness medicine is all about being creative, and being selective in the tools you bring with you. It's possible to build a splint using bark from a tree, or your hiking poles, or any other of a number of objects. It's possible to make a wrap by cutting up a shirt. However, every minute you spend hunting around the forest for the right stick to make a crappy splint out of is another minute of daylight lost in what just became a much longer day for you. In more austere environments there may be no natural materials to use at all, and you may need every piece of gear you have. </p>

<p>You asked for natural materials or common equipment, but I would implore you to make a few simple pieces of first aid equipment part of your common equipment. Especially when car camping, there is no excuse not to carry them. There are a number of relatively light-weight pieces of first aid equipment you can carry which can be used for many applications and will save you a lot of trouble if you need them. A sleeping pad, a SAM splint, a couple ACE wraps, a couple cravats, some coflex tape, and some gauze rolls are easy to carry and can be used to address almost any injury that you have a hope of addressing in the field. The further you are from definitive care and the less you can afford to tie up critical equipment in treating injuries, the more sense it makes to carry these simple pieces of equipment. All of these supplies can be purchased by anybody for very little cost.</p>

<hr>

<h1>Final thoughts</h1>

<p>Splinting is a relatively simple yet effective way to improve patient outcomes in common wilderness injuries. However, it does take practice to build good splints &ndash; you don't want to be learning for the first time when you or your buddy breaks an arm. At the <em>very least</em> you should practice these skills yourself, either at home or when you have some downtime around camp. You'll get a much better sense for what works well when you've both built and been in an improvised splint. </p>

<p>If you're interested in becoming more prepared to deal with wilderness emergencies, take a wilderness medicine course. Wilderness First Aid is a 20ish hour course offered all over the US and other countries. You can take it over a weekend, often for under $200, and learn in detail how to build a splint and so much more. The 80ish hour Wilderness First Responder course is also offered in many places, can be taken over one week, and further expands your scope of care and confidence in responding to wilderness injuries. There's a lot which doesn't fit into the scope of this question which I would do if I were helping somebody with a fracture or sprain, starting with the patient assessment through all the steps of treating the injury and monitoring them during evacuation. </p>

"Sailing with a child","1192","","<p>Inspired by <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/q/4089/66"">this question</a> on taking an infant sailing, as it is quite different when they can move, I thought I'd ask the same question in respect of a toddler or child.</p>

<p>What essential safety considerations should I meet?</p>
","<p>Children are a relatively high risk on board a small boat. At 4 or 5 years old they don't know enough about safety, and by their teens they are either convinced that they are invincible, or terrified that they will drown, so at either end of that spectrum there are challenges.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ideally you want everyone on the boat to be a very strong swimmer. This dramatically improves your chances in the event of an accident.</li>
<li>Additionally, everyone should wear a buoyancy aid with an automatic strobe beacon.</li>
<li>Small children should wear a full harness permanently attached to a runner any time they are on deck.</li>
<li>If your children are no good at following orders, you will need to impress upon them the consequences of their actions. A good way to do this is before before you go far from land, practice your man overboard drill - all adults, and teenagers should be able to helm or act as spotter, as in an emergency you don't know who will be first to the wheel. Spotters should make sure they never lose sight of the man overboard. <strong>The children should all have a shot falling overboard</strong> - especially if it is cold this helps persuade them not to mess about :-)</li>
<li>Know local coastguard numbers/frequencies and make sure you have multiple devices that can connect - mobile phones are fine inshore, but you need a decent radio further out to sea.</li>
<li>Let a friend or neighbour know your expected return time and planned course.</li>
<li>Ideally take your first sails with children in good weather so you can easily practice raising and lowering sails, reefing, mooring and anchoring, making way under sail or power, rules of the road, lights and buoys, tides and navigation etc</li>
<li>Involve the children in every part of it - if they aren't involved they could get very bored, but if they help plan courses, choose times to meet tides etc they will learn valuable skills and hopefully enjoy themselves and get the sailing bug.</li>
<li>Take more food, drinks and snacks than you expect. You can burn a lot of energy on the water, and when heading back to shore you don't want utterly exhausted children.</li>
<li>For the same reason, try to spend the first half of the day generally heading upwind. Tacking is fun anyway, but this gives you more leeway in terms of time when trying to head for home. Nothing worse than realising you have drifted so far downwind that you cannot reach home within hours of your planned arrival time.</li>
</ul>

<p>I used to teach at an RYA sailing school - the essentials I used to teach on day one are appropriate here:</p>

<ul>
<li>Knots</li>
<li>Setting and trimming sail</li>
<li>Understanding your actual course (as opposed to apparent course)</li>
<li>Understanding wind and tide direction and variation</li>
<li>Understanding the limitations of the boat</li>
<li>If you can get them out in dinghies, getting them to capsize is useful - it helps them understand what it will feel like if all has gone wrong</li>

"Learning Anchors - How is single cordelette loop anchor redundant?","1188","","<p>I have climbed for a long time, but I want to switch to cordelette anchors for speed on multipitch. My main concern is in redundancy with the cordelette.</p>

<p>I mentally check the anchor for any problems, and I usually use two slings in this type of equalized configuration + added knots to prevent shockloading if a bolt fails (knots not shown): <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vTKK6.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vTKK6.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Getting into multipitch however, it seems like cordelette is the way to go for setting up quick 3 point anchors. However, the cordelette doesn't seem redundant to me. If the cord breaks above the knot, it's certainly safe, but most breaks happen at the knot. If this happens, the whole thing could potentially unravel!!</p>

<p>I see everyone using a single cordelette to do multipitch though. It seems to be breaking the redundancy rule. It seems silly to double up on carabiners, double up on bolts, double up on slings, and only use one cordelette when the cordelette 10kN failure strength is one of the lowest breaking forces in the system. Am I missing something?</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ty0OV.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ty0OV.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a> - here's a picture of a cordelette doubled up. Even if one strand breaks and unravels in the knot, there is an entirely closed loop of cordelette still in the system.</p>
","<p>The answer to the question in your title is simple: This is not redundant. Is this a problem?</p>

<p>It is important to realize the following about redundancy in climbing:</p>

<p>Mostly there is <strong>no complete redundancy</strong> in climbing. You climb with one rope, you use one sling for self arrest, ... In rescue operations we have the order to be always redundantly secured and you can believe, the resulting battle of material is exorbitant. Redundancy always comes at the cost of <strong>more complexity and weight</strong>, so we only want to go redundant if there is no alternative way to achieve the same (reduced) amount of risk.<br>
The conclusion is that <strong>redundancy is needed where failure is uncertain</strong>.</p>

<p>This is why we back up bolts and pro. They were not tested (in place), so they may fail without you being able to foresee it. In slings, cordelettes, ropes, harnesses, ... this is not the case. These were tested according to norms, so you can determine whether they are strong enough or not. The maximal force a rope can exert is 10kN (again due to testing according to norms), so the maximal force on any point is twice as high (rope redirection): 20kN. Look at slings and quickdraws: They have strength ratings of 22kN so no chance they will brake. Thats why you don't use redundancy on them. Of course this is only true if everything is in good condition and correctly handled, but thats commonplace.</p>

<p>The maximal load onto a cordelette at a belay is 20kN too, so there is no uncertainty. You need to choose the cordelette accordingly and you are save. So the question is whether it is strong enough or not, and not should I use redundancy. As a matter of fact most belays are not built for the worst case: If you belay the leader on your harness, the rope is clipped into the belay and he falls before reaching the first protection there is the chance of such a 20kN load onto the anchor. Very often just one sling with a knot (-50%) is used to connect the bolts and provide a central tie in point, so it can only take 11kN (half the sling rating). This can be mitigated by belaying directly on the belay stating or justified by ""being attentive"", meaning stopping the fall dynamically and thus reducing the actual load (which will anyway never really reach the 20kN). But technically, that situation is not save, but when is climbing save? Never! We just do our best to reduce risk.</p>

","<p>Any cloth bag with a loose weave will also work. Closely woven bags are a second good choice, but won't breathe as well.</p>

","<p>Welcome to outdoors.SE! Older buildings often contain asbestos in solid form, and it may be sealed up (under floorboards, in tape around heating ducts, etc.). As long as it's not ground up into dust, the hazard is minimal. For example, construction workers knocking down a building or remodeling it can get exposed to asbestos dust if they don't realize that there's asbestos in it. Simply walking around in a building that contains undamaged asbestos isn't dangerous. The danger would be greatest for people who have long-term exposure, e.g., the people who used to work in the asbestos industry. You could try to judge whether the building is damaged, but it might be difficult to figure that out.</p>

<p><strong>Treating the symptoms instead of the underlying problem works for me.</strong></p>

<p>I keep an eye on my shoes and hiking boots, and if I see some uneven wearing happening, I sand the sole down with some sandpaper until the sole is even.  Or (if for some reason I don't want to do that), I get a new pair of shoes.  Its expensive (I wind up replacing my outdoor shoes about twice as fast as you usually would), but it really helps fight knee pain (from walking on uneven shoes), since I can't seem to fix my pronation issue.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.  Its not a perfect solution, but its how I manage the problem.</p>

"How precise is a pedometer for estimating on a backpacking trip?","1182","","<p>In practice, how precise is a pedometer for estimating your progress on a trail? For example, if I'm to hike 10 miles, how far should I expect to be from the 10 miles marker?</p>

<p>Is there data comparing pedometers accuracy with GPS?</p>
","<p>Searching online I found lots of useful informations, like e.g. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedometer#Accuracy"">wiki</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The accuracy of step counters varies widely between devices. Typically, step counters are reasonably accurate at a walking pace on a flat surface if the device is placed in its optimal position (usually vertically on the belt clip). Although traditional step counters get affected dramatically when placed at different angles and locations, recent advances have made them more robust to those non-ideal placements. Still, most step counters falsely count steps when a user is driving a car or makes other habitual motions that the device encounters throughout the day. This error accumulates for users with moderate commutes to work. Accuracy also depends on the step-length the user enters. <strong>Best pedometers are accurate to within ± 5% error.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>On <a href=""http://www.medicinenet.com/pedometers/article.htm"">medicinenet</a> one can find an overview on the topic. A useful quote on the topic here is this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The accuracy of pedometers has been carefully studied</strong> because they are frequently used in studies and researchers demand to know if they are reliable and accurate. Research shows that pedometers tend to count steps more accurately at speeds greater than 3 miles per hour (mph) than at slower speeds. Accuracy can exceed 96% when speeds exceed 3 mph, whereas the accuracy drops to between 74% and 91% at speeds from 2 mph to 3 mph, and it drops even further to between 60% and 71% at speeds below 2 mph. The error has to do with the insensitivity of pedometers to detect steps when people shuffle or drag their feet at slow speeds. Detectable vertical movement of the hips is necessary for pedometers to work well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The two types of pedometers differ in terms of accuracy depending on your speed and your habits:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Piezoelectric</strong> pedometers tend to be more sensitive than <strong>spring-levered</strong> at slower speeds and so they may be preferable for individuals who walk slowly. In addition, the tilt of the pedometer is critical for performance with spring-levered devices, but not so with piezoelectric devices (the piezoelectric mechanism is not position dependent). For example, a pedometer may tilt forward into the horizontal plane if an overweight individual with excess abdominal fat wears one on their waist. Tilt in a spring-levered pedometer can throw off the accuracy by as much as 20% at fast speeds and 60% at slow speeds. A piezoelectric pedometer does not have this <strong>tilt error</strong> except at the slowest speed (less than 2 mph), and the error is less than 10%.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More infos and tests on specific pedometers are given on <a href=""http://walking.about.com/cs/measure/a/pedaccuracy04.htm"">walking.com</a>.</p>

<p>I don't know if they compared to GPS data in the tests but I think GPS is always more accurate to measure your distance. These days you can find GPS watches so size/weight is not really a matter (but maybe the pricing).</p>

<p>Before you asked this question I also had no clue about the accuracy but reading a bit on the topic I think I am not going to try one on the trails ;)</p>

","<p>On a longbow you rest the arrow on your hand. If you do it for many hours it can cause irritation so some wear a glove to avoid this.</p>

<p>As for the hand pulling the string it is another form of a finger tab. I have a three fingered glove. It's a matter of preference for this. I found a glove more comfortable than a finger tab.</p>

"Is a full waterproof coat more important than waterproof trousers for hiking?","1180","","<p>I've spent most of my working life outdoors (forestry mostly), but have not done much hiking, which I now intend to do. When working outdoors, my clothing consisted of a wool shirt and waxed cotton waistcoat, anything else would just be ripped to shreds within a few months. If it rained we'd get wet, shelter in the truck for lunch, come home, dry stuff by the fire and then start again tomorrow.</p>

<p>Obviously, this system isn't going to work so well for hiking as I might not be able to have a fire so I'm looking to upgrade my gear. The thing that's confusing me is that there seems to be a plethora of coats available, but very few waterproof trousers and even fewer waistcoats. Intuitively, from my time working outdoors, getting my arms wet was no worse than getting my legs wet in terms of cold/discomfort, as long as my torso stayed dry. Most places though seem to think a full coat is the most important bit of kit with some leggings reserved for it it's really wet.</p>

<p>Is there some logic behind this that I'm missing, or is it just convention? As far as I can tell from experience in the rain, if you wear a short coat, the rain all runs off it onto your thighs, making them soaking wet, so unless you plan to don waterproof trousers <em>every time</em> you put a coat on, you're going to get wet legs. If you're going to accept wet legs in all but the worst of rain, then why not wet arms too and keep everything lighter and more free to move when it's not raining?</p>

<p>Since putting on a pair of waterproof trousers over boots and all every time it rains is such a faff, I'd be inclined to wear a waterproof waistcoat like I used to at work and carry a poncho to cover arms <em>and legs</em> if it rains. Is there something wrong with this set-up that I'm missing, it doesn't seem popular?</p>
","<p>I say you should always wear the gear that you already own and you are comfortable in instead of following some fashion trend. If you like your setup go for it. </p>

<p>Beyond that I think there are some reasons why people tend to recommend a coat over a vest. First and foremost when you are earning a living outdoors you work more or less in all kinds of weather. When you go outdoors for recreation you try your best to only go when the weather is going to be reasonably good. This is where the no waterproof pants comes in. People will bring a jacket for warmth <em>and</em> a hedge against inclimate weather. Like imasodin said when hiking your arms are more likely to get cold and a jacket keeps the weather out better than a vest. If people think odds are good they will encounter significant moisture then people bring water proof pants. Like I said people mostly want to go hike when they think it isn't going to rain so carrying full rain gear is unnecessary but a good jacket that works for wind, water, and general warmth makes perfect sense.</p>

<p>Another consideration is most hikers don't have quality wool long sleeve shirts because you don't find them in generic outdoors stores like REI where many hikers shop. There's a couple reasons for this but the biggest one in my opinion is hiker/backpacker fashion follows climbing/mountaineering clothing trends. These realms embrace fancy synthetic fibers due to their light weight. I have some Army surplus thick wool pants that are phenomenal for a cold rainy day. Of course they weigh a ton, aren't worn by serious mountaineers anymore for that reason, and as a result aren't being marketed by major brands because who really wants to go for a 10 mile hike in the pouring rain where you can't see the dramatic sweeping views anyway?</p>

<p>To address the poncho bit some people do carry ponchos with them in case it rains. Of course since they aren't planning on going out when it is raining these ponchos are the thin plastic ""emergency"" ponchos. Ponchos are fabulous for walking around in when it is wet but they also aren't as functional as pants and a jacket for climbing or mountaineering. Of course you aren't going to plan on climbing or mountaineering in the rain but if you do I know I'd rather be reaching over my head in the rain with a jacket than a poncho. </p>

<p>In summary:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wear what you have if it is comfortable </li>
<li>most people plan trips around good weather </li>
<li>Hiker fashion follows backpacker/climbing/mountaineering fashion where weight savings are prized above almost all else </li>
<li>Jackets offer a good balance of protection from the wind, cold, and occasional rainfall. </li>
<li>Vests are rare since jackets are so dominant and as a result the shirts commonly found in stores pair better with jackets than vests.</li>

"Why is it tiring to ""keep down"" with a slower person on a walk or hike?","1179","","<p>It is understandable why it is tiring to walk faster than one's normal pace in order to keep up with someone younger and/or fitter than oneself.  Simple physics: one is exerting more energy per unit time than one can sustain.  </p>

<p>But walking at a slower pace than is natural is also tiring.  And resting doesn't help  -- to the contrary.  Does anyone have an explanation for why this is so?       </p>
","<p>In general every individual has a natural walking cadence (steps per minute) and they vary their actual speed by increasing or decreasing stride length. Even amongst a very fit group the most comfortable natural pace will vary and some people will be built for speed on the flat while some stroll up brutal  hills others will happily carry their own bodyweight in kit at a steady pace over any terrain. </p>

<p>However the degree to which you can vary pace is limited and there is a point where your strides are uncomfortably long or (as in this case) short to maintain an efficient gait. </p>

<p>The main reason for this is that natural walking is effectively a whole series of fallings forward ie you aren't pulling yourself forward with your feet you are swinging your centre of mass forward and moving your feet to maintain balance. So your natural gait is a lot like a pendulum and like a pendulum it has a natural frequency. </p>

<p>As this happens you are transferring energy around a bit like a slinky falling down some steps, although some energy is lost each step a natural walking pace will conserve quite a lot from one to the next. </p>

<p>If you have to move too slowly the your gait becomes a sequence of individual steps rather than a smooth flow from one stance to another and rather than a recycling the energy of each step you end up using energy to hold yourself back and check your stride. </p>

<p>This is exacerbated if you are carrying a pack as you end up accelerating and decelerating it with every step rather than keeping your centre of mass moving at a fairly constant velocity. </p>

<p>In practice if you are walking with someone who is struggling it is best for everybody for you to take some of their gear and/or for you to continue at your own pace for a while and then stop and wait for them. </p>

<p>Also if someone is having trouble have a group rest and find out if there is any underlying reason why they are struggling, if they are carrying too much weight, are dehydrated, hungry ete etc it is better for the group as a whole to solve that issue than let them struggle even if you have to push them to admit it. Most people will need to have  this explained to them and will not admit  a problem unless pressed. </p>

"Maintaining a Mountain Hut","1176","","<p>I loved and appreciate the concept of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_hut"">Mountain Huts</a>. Though I have never visited one, this really sounds appealing. In my country, India, we don't have Mountain Huts, so we have to manage it all on our own.</p>

<p>But, I wonder if a local organization clears out the necessary obligations and does finish formalities for that, what should a Mountain Hut be equipped with?<br>
P.S. I am not referring to higher altitudes. I am typically speaking about Indian subcontinental weather, where it rains heavy during June to September and rest of the season is pretty much hot, ambient temperature is at about 38 <sup>o</sup>C.</p>
","<p>My experience of mountain huts huts is mainly from UK and Europe. Standards in other parts of the world may vary.</p>

<p>Mountain huts come in a wide range of different varieties. At the basic end you have unmanned huts or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bothy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bothies</a>. These can range from very basic with just a roof and wooden bunks to put your sleeping kit on to reasonably nice with beds, stove, toilets, etc. Generally unmanned huts are free to use but rely on the hiking community to keep them in good order and maintain them. Kit in them should be basic and hard wearing.</p>

<p>At the other end you have maintained huts common in the Alps. Many are maintained by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_club_huts"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Alpine clubs</a> but there are private ones too. These basically work like small hotels in that there are staff who maintain the hut, have a kitchen/restaurant and sell food etc. Generally sleeping is in bunk rooms with blankets provided, but often you must use/rent a sheet type sleeping bag, although some places have private rooms too. Washing/toilet facilities can range from basic with no shower to what you would get in a cheapish hotel often depending on availability/amount of running water. One issue with many huts is resupplying due to their inaccessible location. I have seen a number of solutions including: cable car, helicopter and carrying equipment up by foot.</p>

<p>There are a wide range in-between, including staffed places that provide self service cooking facilities. The main question is what sort of hut are you aiming for? The obvious priority is to have somewhere dry (and warm) for people to sleep. Kit in huts is generally kept to a minimum and it is as hard wearing as possible as it will often have minimal maintenance and some fairly rough treatment. Manned huts often have some nicer/luxury kit, e.g. board games, as they can better supervise its use. However, most kit is still on the utilitarian side, and generally people who go to mountain huts generally do not expect luxury accommodation. If you can provide a warm dry bed, good simple food and maybe a beer people will be quite happy.</p>

"What's a good, secure way to attach neodymium magnets to a geocache?","1176","","<p>I've grabbed some neodymium magnets  as a cheap way of attaching small geocaches to metallic objects such as road signs and poles. However, I'm not sure of the best way of attaching the magnets - tape tends to wear away, and over time with people constantly detaching / reattaching the cache I would imagine glue wouldn't necessarily last long either.</p>

<p>Is there a particularly secure way of attaching them, or is it just a case of doing the best you can and replacing when they go walkabout?</p>
","<p>What I have always used is to have the magnet epoxied to the inside of the container. </p>

<p>Benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>There is never a force pulling the magnet away from the container</li>
<li>There is no weathering of epoxy</li>
<li>No holes required</li>
