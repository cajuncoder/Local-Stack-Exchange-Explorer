"Honda Accord radio anti-theft code not working...what am I doing wrong and what should I do?","564734","","<p>I had to remove the battery so I can replace the driver's side low beam headlight.
I didn't bother to buy a settings saver because I found the security code in my Honda's packet (I bought this car used and luckily the owner was pretty organized with documentation and maintenance records).</p>

<p>Initially when I turned on the car...I see 1:01 on the clock. Then when I turned the radio on I see ""CODE"". So I used the preset buttons (1 ... 6) to punch in my code. However, every time I enter it I see ""Err"". First ""Err1"", then ""Err2""...then eventually ""Erre""!</p>

<p>I also went onto this website: <a href=""https://radio-navicode.honda.com/framepage.aspx?theme=Honda"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://radio-navicode.honda.com/framepage.aspx?theme=Honda</a>
to verify that I have the right security code (I used the radio serial number on the documentation card to retrieve the radio security code from the website) and indeed it is correct.</p>

<p>One other thing that I read to try is to hold down Preset 1 and Preset 6 buttons...and then turn the car on. Supposedly I should see the radio serial number displayed. However this did not work. I wanted to do this so that I can verify the radio serial number. I also wanted to do this because in case this radio has a different serial number I can use this serial to retrieve the security code from the website.</p>

<p>Now, I'm kind of stuck. Any Honda (2003 Accord) owners out there? What am I doing wrong? What should I do next?</p>
","<p>So, I called the dealer and they gave me more confidence that trying to get the serial number of the radio is the way to go.
The dealer suggested pressing 1 &amp; 6 on the radio again.</p>

<p>After MANY attempts of trying different ways to do this, I found the following to work:</p>

<ol>
<li>Turn on the car</li>
<li>Make sure the radio is off...if not off, turn off. Should just see the clock</li>
<li>Press and hold preset button 1 &amp; 6 down simultaneously for 15 - 20 seconds</li>
<li>While still holding those buttons, press the power button</li>
<li>You should now see ""U"" and a 4 digit number(ex: Uxxxx), then it should toggle and show ""L"" and a 4 digit numbers (ex:Lyyyy).</li>
<li>Your radio's serial number is xxxxyyyy</li>
<li>Now go to <a href=""https://radio-navicode.honda.com/framepage.aspx?theme=Honda"">https://radio-navicode.honda.com/framepage.aspx?theme=Honda</a>, enter the appropriate information to retrieve the access code!</li>
</ol>

<p>It turned out that the card that I have when I purchased this used car had the WRONG serial number and access code. I don't know if the previous owner had another Honda or not...maybe the card goes with another car.</p>

"How should I remove a paint scuff on my vehicle?","518228","","<p>The painted edge of a side mirror on another car recently scraped the side of my vehicle, leaving a scuff of paint about half a meter long.</p>

<p>There is no indentation or scratch, but the other vehicle left its mark behind in a very difficult-to-remove paint scuff.</p>

<p>I can remove it by carefully scratching with fingernails, so I am sure it will come off, but I'm not sure how best to fully remove it, as any paint-removing chemicals surely will damage the coat I <em>don't</em> want to remove.</p>

<p>What do you recommend for removing paint scuffs like this?</p>
","<p>If it's deep enough that merely wiping it doesn't remove it, the scuff is deeper than just the very top surface of your paint.  First, try Meguiars Scratch-x with a microfiber cloth.  Rub it in. Try two or three passes to see if this removes the scuff mark.  Doing so by hand won't remove any of your paint unless its been compromised (cracked, flaking, peeling, etc).</p>

<p>If this doesn't work, have a pro detailer take a pass with an random orbital (or rotary if they know what they're doing) polisher + some compound.  This will take it right out and leave the paint pretty shiny.  The problem with this is, it will be shinier than the rest of your car and you may be tempted to just have them do the whole thing. </p>

"What actually happens when there is not enough oil in a car engine?","479952","","<p>When a car is topped up with oil, it clear to most people that you are supposed to fill it to the recommended amount as specified by the manufacturer (normally on a dip stick). </p>

<p><strong><em>What exactly are all of the disadvantages to running an engine when the oil becomes too low?</em></strong></p>
","<p>Engine oil does much more for an engine than lubricate. It provides cooling, cleaning, and a bunch of other chores. You already know engine function is degraded when you run out of oil. Let's see if we can run it down to make more sense for you how it happens. </p>

<p>Let's say, for lack of argument, your engine is running with very little to no oil. The engine oil light is on as the engine is running. Antifreeze is up to snuff, but that won't stop overheating for too long. Here is what happens:</p>

<p>As whatever limited oil is in the engine is pushed around, it becomes hotter and hotter. It becomes hotter because the oil isn't allowed enough time to cool down a little before it is required to go back into the engine and do its thing. As this happens, the oil will wear out faster. Fully synthetic oil will last longer than dino (refined) oil, but it will suffer defeat sooner or later as well. Several reactions happen to the oil, to include oxidation, thermal degradation, and compressive heating. Mind you, all of these things are created under normal use conditions (and thus the reason we change oils when we should), but under extreme conditions as you've suggested, <em>it all happens much faster</em>.</p>

<p>This is a great image which describes what happens from the <a href=""http://www.machinerylubrication.com/Read/475/oil-breakdown"">Machinery Lubrication website</a> -</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wTvDl.gif""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wTvDl.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>All of this breakdown creates the regular: tar; sludge; varnish; soot; etc. All of these things start depositing on the internals of your engine, such as the rings, bearings, cylinder walls ... anywhere oil would normally flow. If you go back to your chemistry teachings, you'll probably remember that a large portion of oil is carbon. All of the previously mentioned nasty substances are actually a carbon byproducts. As these carbon substances continue to deposit, any part which comes in contact with them gets wear on them as carbon can become quite hard and/or sticky under the right circumstances. This starts creating more friction on these parts. So now instead of cooling/lubricating/cleaning, the oil has broken down is now heating (due to more friction), creating deposits, and making the engine a <em>really filthy place</em>. You should realize it is now doing <em>everything</em> it was originally meant to replace. </p>

<p>Every machined surface within the engine is susceptible to the increased wear. As the oil continues to break down at an ever increasing rate, the temperature inside the engine on these machines surfaces continue to get hotter and hotter. Wear occurs faster and faster until something gives. Most of the times in these situations, the first thing to go is a rod or main bearing. If the backside of the rod bearing is strong enough when this happens, you can throw a rod. </p>

<p>Throwing a rod is basically where the friction on the bearing at the rod journal of the crankshaft is strong enough to overcome the strength of the rod itself and it has a catastrophic plastic deformation of the metal. The piston can go down the bore and will not return. It can go out the bottom and then gets flung around inside of the oil pan, or the rod itself will break and force itself and/or the piston out the side of the engine block. </p>

<p>At this point, there is no coming back from it (in most cases). The engine is done and will need to be replaced.</p>

<p>If you continue to run the engine with very low oil, <em>destruction will occur</em> ... and no ... I'm not being melodramatic about it.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Here are a couple of videos which describe what happens when you don't change the oil in your vehicle. This is what happens with oil when there isn't enough of it ... with lack of oil, it doesn't take 130k miles to look like this.</p>

"what is the difference between DOT3 and DOT4 brake fluids?","422701","","<p>What is the difference between DOT3 and DOT4 brake fluids?</p>

<p>What could possibly go wrong if I use a (4 times cheaper) DOT3 brake fluid instead of the DOT4 which manufacturer recommends (but allows adding ""some"" DOT3 occasionally)?</p>

<p>What will happen if I just use only DOT3? </p>
","<p>If the manual is saying small amounts of DOT3 can be used, what they are most likely saying is if you find yourself with low brake fluid and only DOT3 is available, it is better to use that than to not have brake fluid.</p>

<p>Once you get back home though you need to get the recommended DOT4 back in the system by bleeding the system and filling with DOT4.</p>

<p>As already stated, DOT4 handles higher heat.  If your car is calling for DOT4, that means that the manufacturer does not feel comfortable that the braking system will not raise the brake fluid above a temperature that DOT3 can handle.</p>

<p>Another point to make here is there are two boiling temperatures for brake fluid, Dry and Wet.</p>

<p>When you've just replaced your brake fluid and the system has been properly bled, you are working at the Dry boiling temperature.  Over time, water works its way into the system through age, heat cycling, through the hoses, etc.  You are then working at your Wet boiling point for the fluid.</p>

<p>So again, if you get stuck in a spot where you need to put some new brake fluid into the system and all you have available is DOT3, most likely at that point your DOT4 has degraded some and the fresh DOT3 will be close to where the DOT4 is at, but this won't stay true, the DOT3 will degrade once in the lines so the above statement of replace it as soon as possible holds true.</p>

"What causes an engine to burn oil?","408776","","<p>What are the different problems that can cause an engine to burn oil and in general how difficult / expensive is each one to repair?  How do you diagnose each potential cause?</p>

<p>I found this article which describes some of the problems:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.agcoauto.com/content/news/p2_articleid/233"">Why Does My Engine Use Oil</a></p>

<p>I've seen three things so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bad Piston Rings</li>
<li>Bad PCV</li>
<li>Valve Guide Seals</li>
</ul>

<p>Regarding diagnosing oil consumption and smoke the above article says the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With older vehicles this was typically accompanied with a puff of
  smoke from the exhaust. With modern vehicles, the catalytic converter
  usually prevents smoke. Smoke in the exhaust is vaporized by the
  converter. Unfortunately, this may drastically raise the temperature
  and damage the converter, over time.</p>
</blockquote>
","<p>Towards the diagnosis end of things, there are some general guidelines to follow:</p>

<p>If you are seeing smoke coming from your exhaust, what color is the smoke? </p>

<ul>
<li>If it's blue, then it's oil </li>
<li>If it's black, it means you are running rich (too much fuel).</li>
<li>If it's white, the car may be burning antifreeze or (quite rare) auto-trans fluid.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since it's blue smoke you are seeing, you can know that oil is the problem. What can cause oil smoke?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If the smoke only comes at start-up and quickly goes away, it can be valve seals and/or valve guides. This is because while the car sits for extended periods of time, the oil has time to seep past the valve seal and collect on top of the valve (or if the valve is in the open position, it could run past and on top of the piston). When you go to start your car, the oil is then burned, giving the tell tale puff of blue smoke. <strong>COST TO FIX:</strong> There is moderate cost involved with this, depending on the vehicle/engine. If just the seals, this can be accomplished most of the time with keeping the engine mostly together and replacing the seals. Most of the cost here is labor. If the valve guides, this requires an engine tear down. Your heads will have to be taken apart and new guides installed. There is a lot more labor here and a bit more in parts.</p></li>
<li><p>If you see smoke as you are decelerating, this too is a possible sign of valve seals and/or valve guides. This is because as you decelerate, there is a large vacuum build up within the intake tract. There is enough vacuum to pull oil past the valve seal if it's worn. <strong>COST TO FIX:</strong> Same as above.</p></li>
<li><p>If you see smoke while accelerating, this is a sign your oil control rings are worn. These are the bottom rings used in the ring pack. When they are worn (or the cylinders are worn past tolerance), oil can flow past the rings as the piston travels down the cylinder. The oil control rings normally will scrape the cylinder of the oil, pushing it back down into the crank case. <strong>COST TO FIX:</strong> There fix is quite expensive, as it requires a complete engine rebuild to fix.</p></li>
<li><p>If a PCV is bad, you normally won't see burning oil. What you'll see is seals and gaskets failing. This can cause a loss of oil (and a very dirty engine bay). It's one of those things which can sneak up on you if you aren't paying attention. While a bad PCV is not a good thing, don't look here for a reason you're seeing oil smoke coming out the tail pipe. <strong>COST TO FIX:</strong> If you catch it before it becomes an issue, it's actually quite cheap to fix ... just replace the valve. If you see leaks at seals or gaskets, your expense goes way up, but it depends on which seal or gasket is leaking. Easy to get to seals or gaskets will cost much less, because the labor is much less. The converse holds true - Labor is a determining factor here.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are seeing blue smoke which goes away after an oil change, but slowly comes back as you get closer to your scheduled maintenance, this could be a sign you have an internal fuel leak which is thinning the oil. As the oil gets thinner it passes by the oil control rings easier, causing your vehicle to smoke. An easy way to check this is by pulling the dipstick and smelling the oil. If you smell fuel, this may be the issue. This can be caused by an injector which is stuck open, or possibly an internal failure of a fuel pressure valve which would allow the gas to escape to where it doesn't belong. <strong>COST TO FIX:</strong> Diagnosis of what is going on will take a little bit of money. This could be a very low cost fix, to a moderate cost, depending on the actual cause. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>If you are not seeing smoke, but you're seeing the oil drop lower and lower as time moves on, this may be a ""sort of"" normal oil usage in your vehicle. Take for instance my '06 Chevrolet Silverado. Its engine is an LS variant. As these engines get up in age, it is common for them to use more oil. You don't see it from the exhaust, but it uses it up, none the less. The engine still runs great and the gas mileage has stayed about the same. </p>

<p>Your vehicle could also be losing oil via leakage (or seepage). As engines get up in mileage, this is a very common thing. If you see spots on the driveway where you park the car, this could very well be the issue. Be mindful that vehicles will loose more oil during operation than they will just sitting in your driveway.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> In deference to your edit - I can see where an up-to-temperature catalytic convertor might make some difference in smoke from the tail pipe. This does not hold true, though, for start-up smoke (puff of blue smoke), as the cat is not hot enough to make a difference. It also won't make any difference once the catalyst is covered in oil suit or if there is too much oil for the cat to deal with. Sooner or later when oil gets burnt in this manner, you'll see the blue smoke. You probably have to put new cats on at that point, as well.</p>

"Should I resurface or replace my rotors everytime I replace brake pads?","383597","","<p>I have heard it is proper practice to replace or resurface your brake rotors every time your do a brake pad replacement.  Does this need to be done every single time or is it overkill?  Maybe it is just something easy to do, might as well replace while you are in there type of thing?</p>
","<p>The decision to replace is largely based on the thickness.  The repair manual should tell you the minimum thickness, below which you should replace the rotors when doing the repair.  Use a pair of calipers and measure the rotor thickness, if you're below this number you need to replace the rotors.</p>

<p>You may also wish to replace the rotors if you have particularly heavy use planned and you are getting close to the limit.  For example, if you live in the mountains, do a lot of towing, are planning to attend track days...</p>

<p>You definitely need to get them resurfaced if they are warped or damaged.  Usually you can feel if they are warped through the brake pedal when stopping -- instead of a smooth stop it will kind of vibrate or pulsate when braking at higher speeds.  It's very noticeable.  This can be measured with a dial gauge and checked against the repair manual's recommendations for ""runout"".  You will need a dial gauge, and some sort of a mount to hold the gauge steady while you spin the rotor.</p>

<p>Damage is usually caused by the old brake pads wearing completely through and tend to leave a very rough surface on the disc.  These should definitely be turned, if possible.</p>

<p>Before having a damaged or warped set of rotors turned, check their thickness.  If they're close to the minimum, resurfacing them will leave you with rotors that are too thin.</p>

<p>If you're at this point, you should have rotors that are thick enough and not damaged.  Many people recommend resurfacing of them so the pads and rotors can better mate and wear into each-other.  I tend to agree with this, but I have replaced pads on cars that I drive less spiritedly without resurfacing them, and have not had problems.</p>

"Steering wheel shakes at high speeds","375413","","<p>the steering wheel sometimes shakes at high speeds around 70 miles per hour. It does not always happen. Some day when I am driving at 70, I feel no shakes. some day it shakes badly at the same speed. Also, if I drive slower or faster a speed range (usually between 68 and 75), it never shakes.</p>

<p>I did the following, but still the wheel shakes sometimes:</p>

<ol>
<li>I had the left wheel bearing replaced a month ago. The mechanic told me it needs to be replaced. </li>
<li>Tires are fine (not perfect, but not bad either). I had them rotated a month ago.</li>
<li>I had the front rotars and pads replaced a month ago. When I brake, it does NOT shake.</li>
</ol>

<p>This shaking wheel problem has been around for quite some time (almost two years). What service does the car need?</p>

<p>Update: I had the tires balanced, and it is a little bit better now. It is not perfect yet. I was told that the tires are kinda cheap, low quality tires that are not perfectly round. </p>
","<p>Issues involving steering wheel vibrations problems <em>usually</em> are most noticeable at one or two narrow speed ranges (5-10mph and 60-70mph), and will decrease significantly, and in some cases, even disappear outside of these ranges. The amount of vibration caused by worn tires will often be seen over a broader speed range if the tire is worn more. The severity of the vibration is directly related to the vehicles speed. Also, the speed range at which the vibration is felt is also directly related to the amount of wear the tires have endured. At low speeds sometimes a ""wobbles"" can be felt. These are mostly caused by bent wheels, tires with shifted belts (also referred to as ""runout""), and suspension/alignment issues.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Tire or Wheel</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><em>Quality</em>

<ul>
<li>A quick indication of either a poor quality wheel or tire is usually seen by the use of a lot of weights used when balancing the wheel/tire combination. When using a higher end tire on a ""straight"" wheel you should need somewhere around .5oz of weight per wheel. Tires of inferior quality are often seen with weaker tread layers and belt seating. and may simply just be out of round.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Damage</em>

<ul>
<li>Broken Belt

<ul>
<li>When a belt is broken inside of a tire it will cause the tire to ""bounce"" since it is unable to keep it's form. Think of a tire without a broken belt as a baseball, and the tire with a broken belt as a stress ball. Below is an image of a tire with a broken belt. You can see the bottom of the tread is 100% worn while the top of the tire still has tread left. This was caused by the ""bouncing"" condition.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2hlYk.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Slipped Belt

<ul>
<li>With a slipped belt in a tire it will cause the tire to ""wobble"" and the steering wheel to shake. Here is a image of a severely slipped belt.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NylA5.jpg"" alt=""beltslip""></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Wheel Balance</strong> <em>(out of round, bent, excessive wear, uneven tread, etc)</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Usually, neither tires nor wheels are perfect. This is the reason why wheels are balanced whenever tires are replaced and then, rebalanced periodically as they wear. Driving with unbalanced wheels long enough can and will cause flat spots in the tire, which will then always vibrate. Performing a static balance is just not good enough. Balance should always be checked at driving speeds this is known as dynamic balancing. The wheels are removed from the vehicle and one by one put on a Balancing Machine where the mechanic will enter in the appropriate measurements and then the machine will spin the wheel and printout location and amount of weight needed in order to properly balance the wheel. Also, if the wrong type of weights for your wheel type are used, they are likely to come off, giving you an instant balance problem.

</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Suspension &amp; Alignment</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><em>Suspension</em>

<ul>
<li>Excessively worn suspension components will cause effect the way in which the tire contacts the road. This is due to the fact that if any component (ball-joint, tie-rod, wheel bearing, etc) has excessive play it makes the position  because it may make maintaining proper alignment impossible. It may also cause other problems not related to wheel balance and wear.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Alignment</em>

<ul>
<li>Maladjusted Camber will <em>not</em> directly cause a vibration, but it <em>can</em> cause uneven and/or rapid tire wear. In turn effect the balance/smoothness of a tires rotation. A lot of mechanics will <em>insist</em> that an improper toe adjustment will <em>not</em> be the cause of a steering wheel vibration, but I remain skeptical. Even if I'm wrong it <em>will</em> still certainly causes rapid and uneven tire wear. Caster has no effect on tire wear <em>but</em> it will effect steering wheel's ability to return after making a turn. Bad alignment is the cause of many tread wear problems that will create vibration issues even if the wheels are perfectly balanced.</li>

","<p>Copper conducts better and is generally used in higher-performance/modified engines. In dedicated race cars resistor-less copper plugs are used.</p>

<p>Iridium and platinum plugs are chosen for their longevity only. You <em>shouldn't</em> gap iridiums because of potential damage to the tips. For that reason and their inferior conductivity, they aren't used in modified engines. Keep in mind their price, as well.</p>

<p>Any claims of more power or fuel efficiency of one type over another are pretty much baseless unless you were using the wrong plugs to begin with. Stick with what your owner's manual calls for unless you have a reason to upgrade/modify. For example, if you have a turbocharged car but are running more boost you might gap your plugs a little smaller to accommodate. The claims by parts stores to upgrade to the Triple-Spark Ultimate Unobtainium plugs are just upsells.</p>

"When do brake rotors really need to be replaced?","342789","","<p>I need to replace my rear brake pads.  A mechanic suggested I also replace my rotors because they are rusted around the edges.  The rotors are in fact quite rusted, however, there is no rust on the actual surface that touches the pads.  Running my fingers over the surface of the rotors, there does not appear to be any buildup of brake pad deposits and the surface is relatively smooth.  There is however one small circular scratch around one of the rotors.  While the pads are ready to be replaced, they are still within standard tolerances, so it's not like there is metal-on-metal going on.  The mechanic warned that replacing the pads without replacing the rotors at the same time would be a waste because the rusted rotors will just eat up the new pads.  I find that hard to believe given that the rust is just on the extreme edges of the rotors, which are parts that do not appear to touch the pads.  The brakes do not appear to make any abnormal noises at all.  Therefore, according to <a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/3340/how-do-i-know-if-i-need-new-brakes"">this post</a>, it doesn't seem like the rotors need to be replaced.</p>

<p><strong>Is rust on the parts of the rotors that do not touch the pads enough to require replacement?</strong>  Is there a way I can tell on my own if they need replacement?</p>
","<p>It's not required that you replace your brake rotors at the same time you replace your brake pads, but there are many reasons why it's highly recommended.</p>

<p>Primarily, it's not the rust you should worry about, there most likely always going to be some rust around the edges, that's not at all out of the ordinary. The main problem is that your rotors are most likely grooved, and putting fresh pads on grooved rotors is going to wear the pads faster. Using those grooved brake rotors could also cause your wheels to wobble once you add new brake pads.</p>

"Can I drive a car with only water and no coolant if it has a leak?","312020","","<p>Recently, I was informed that a car I share ('02 Nissan Sentra) was close to overheating. I was told it gets close to the upper limit very quickly upon running the car. When I inspected the vehicle, I realized that the coolant overflow was empty and the radiator's coolant level was rather low (not sure exactly how low but it seems at most 75% remains).</p>

<p>The car must be taken to a mechanic. However, the mechanic I trust and usually use is about 30 miles away. I assume there is a leak in a hose, connector, or perhaps the water pump. The radiator is new so I do not suspect it is the source of this issue.</p>

<p>Because I am assuming there will be a leak, I think that when I drive it, it will most likely loose coolant. Also because of this assumption, I am weary of putting coolant in if it is just going to leak out.</p>

<p>I am assuming I will have to make a few stops to fill the overflow (not touching the radiator). Can I put pure water in the radiator and overflow tank and limp the car 30 miles (mostly on the freeway - yikes)?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>Great answers here, I just wanted to post what I actually ended up doing in the hopes of it helping someone at some point, or maybe to satisfy curiosity.</p>

<p>I decided not to go with pure water because I have read that a 50/50 ratio of coolant to water is desirable and figured even if it were leaking, should it be slow, I should follow best practice.</p>

<p>I was unsure what type of coolant my car used, so I just went to the dealer and got a container of what was standard.</p>

<p>The reservoir was completely empty, and the radiator had a low level of water. I added some water (maybe 1.5L) to the radiator to top it off and I filled the reservoir to the ""MAX"" line. </p>

<p>I read from a post that a simple test you can do is to start the car, run it a little, turn it off, and then listen for a leak. I tried that, but perhaps the car did not get hot enough, or there wasn't a leak evident to that method.</p>

<p>I then looked on the ground for any evidence of a leak and saw none. I started the car and let it run while looking to see if any fluid was leaking and could not see any after a minute or so.</p>

<p>After this I drove the car trying to maintain under 3000 rpm and made it to the mechanic's shop like that.</p>

<p>Overall, I would say this situation was mild in comparison to what could happen. I am definitely <em>not</em> recommending to drive a car with a major leak, or even with a medium one. My car exhibited no signs of leaking and based off of that I drove it.</p>
","<p>First thing I'd try to figure out is how quickly it leaks - run it, stick your head underneath it as check if there is any visible leaking. If there is, chances are that it's not going to make it for 30 miles. I'd also check for any evidence of oil and water mixing. If there is, don't drive it.</p>

<p>If it's not leaking that badly I'd be tempted to top it up with plain water just to check if that reduces the temperature to something more normal. If it doesn't there's a chance that you either have a thermostat that's failed closed, a blockage in the cooling system or a really bad water pump. Again, check for leaks with the engine running and warm, any visible leaks this side of the odd drip and I'd be very careful about driving the car.</p>

<p>In general, water on its own tends to cool better than water + antifreeze, so you're not risking any damage from running water in the engine provided the outside temperature doesn't drop below freezing. Even then, you probably are going to be OK as hopefully there is a little antifreeze left in the existing coolant. Either way, advise the mechanic that he might have to drain the cooling system immediately depending on the outside temperatures.</p>

<p>If in doubt, I would get the car transported to the mechanic - even if you pay retail for the recovery it's likely to be cheaper than a blown engine, unless the engine is fairly terminal already.</p>

"How do I loosen stuck lug nuts in order to change a tire?","302647","","<p>How do I loosen car tire lug nuts (so that I can change a tire) when they are really really stuck?</p>

<p>I have tried turning the provided wrench, even standing and jumping on it. This worked for 4 of the lug nuts, but not the bottom-most one.</p>

<p>I have heard of using a <strong>rust remover/blaster</strong>, but I do not see much rust at all, and the tires are not too old if I recall correctly.</p>

<p>Another recommendation I see is to use a <strong>long pipe</strong> on the handle of the wrench for more torque. But even with just the wrench I seem to be warping the stock wrench with my efforts!</p>

<p>Some forums recommend using a <strong>4-way lug wrench</strong>, but they do not say how to use one, or why they are better than the stock wrench. Can they provide me more torque than jumping on a standard wrench?</p>

<p>Finally, I am hopeful for an answer other than <em>take it to a shop.</em> I know I can do that, but I am trying to avoid the expense of a tow.</p>
","<p>Remember that lug nuts are exposed to literally every element that could possibly cause corrosion.  It sounds like your last nut is stuck due to some rust or oxidation that you can't see.  Here's how I generally approach a badly stuck nut:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Check your safety gear: eye protection, jack stands, everything to keep yourself from getting killed when this wheel finally comes loose.</p></li>
<li><p>Get out the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetrating_oil"">penetrating oil</a> (AKA rust blaster).  Really soak the bolt and nut.  Now walk away and let it soak in, possibly for hours.</p></li>
<li><p>Affix the correct socket to your <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaker_bar"">breaker bar</a>.  This is a totally different beast from the stock tire iron.  Its handle is much more durable and is very unlikely to bend under the torque that you're about to apply.  Remember, think carefully about what's going to happen when the nut lets go.  If you're pulling, it's not hard to end up punching yourself in the face.  If you're pushing, don't let your fingers bash into the garage floor or other components.  <em>I've hurt myself using both methods when battling bolts  (never worse than giving my wife an excuse to eyeroll me, thankfully).</em></p></li>
<li><p>Try getting the nut off.</p></li>
<li><p>Didn't work?  Take a longish piece of steel pipe, stick it over the end of the breaker bar to increase the moment arm of the lever and try again.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Once I get to this point, I usually cycle between penetrating oil and a super long breaker bar.  Things eventually come loose after a sufficiently long period of <strong>HULK SMASH</strong> time.</p>

<p><em>NOTE: when working with exhaust nuts and bolts, the bolt will eventually snap under enough torque.  This is less likely with the much more robust wheel studs.</em></p>

<p>You <strong>should</strong> be concerned about your health, especially if you have allergies.

<p>The things you should do to remove the cause of your problem and prevent it from happening again:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Run it on recirculation <strong>only</strong> when
something stinks outside, or you want
it to cool down quickly. Fresh air
from outside will help it dry out
better.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure that your A/C drain isn't
clogged and there is no water
building up.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>And this is what you could do to remove the unpleasant effects:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Run the heater on full for a while,
that will dry out the system and
might 'cook' the mildew.</p></li>
<li><p>Change your cabin air filter (if you have one).</p></li>
<li><p>There are special sprays sold to
remove the mildew from the A/C system
(read the instructions carefully

"Running with straight water as coolant in the summer. Is it fine?","252627","","<p>I grew up flushing the coolant twice yearly. In the Spring, you drain the antifreeze and fill with straight water for the summer. In the Fall, you drain the water and put in a 50/50 antifreeze/water mixture. </p>

<p>I have heard (from an auto store clerk) that running just water will cause overheating. The clerk also said that antifreeze prevents corrosion and sediment build up and cleans the coolant system.</p>

<p>Despite years of using water in the summer, I have never experienced any problems that were obviously related.</p>

<p>Do I need to start using antifreeze, even in the summer?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>I have heard (from an auto store clerk) that running just water will cause overheating. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, that's not true.  Water isn't the cause of overheating.  Your coolant mixture (of whatever proportion) and radiator <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifreeze#Automotive_and_internal_combustion_engine_use"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">work together to get rid of the heat</a>.  If it's not hot, you won't overheat.  However, when it is hot, the coolant can only absorb heat up to its boiling point.</p>

<p>Here's a super high level summary of a cooling system:</p>

<ol>
<li>The cool coolant is placed in contact with the metal of the hot engine.</li>
<li>Heat is transferred from the metal of the engine to the liquid coolant, heating it up.</li>
<li>Hot coolant is pumped to the radiator, making room for cooler coolant to move into the engine.</li>
<li>Hot coolant is placed in contact with the metal of the cool radiator, cooling it off.</li>
</ol>

<p>Liquid cooling requires the best contact possible between the metal and the liquid for most efficient heat transfer.  Problems occur as the coolant approaches it's boiling point: steam bubbles start to form, especially at hot metal surfaces.  Each one of those bubbles is a less efficient point of heat transfer.  That means less heat leaving the engine, meaning a hotter engine, more spots where bubbles will form, repeating until steam starts coming out of the hood.  </p>

<p>So, one of your main goals in assembling a useful cooling system is to ensure that the boiling point of the coolant is high in order to prevent high temperature disaster.  Water's boiling point is 100 C = 212 F.  Straight ethylene glycol's <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylene_glycol#Current_methods"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">boiling point</a> is at 197.3 C = 387 F.  Of course, you shouldn't use straight ethylene glycol in the radiator either for the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylene_glycol#Coolant_and_heat_transfer_agent"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sake of efficiency</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The clerk also said that antifreeze prevents corrosion and sediment build up and cleans the coolant system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That depends on the product.  Quite a lot of the coolants on today's market will <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifreeze#Corrosion_Inhibitors"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">inhibit corrosion and minimize sediments</a>.  Some, like <a href=""http://www.redlineoil.com/Products.aspx?pcid=10"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Water Wetter</a>, will actually increase the cooling system's ability to carry away heat.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Despite years of using water in the summer, I have never experienced any problems that were obviously related.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just remember that lack of evidence doesn't necessarily indicate absence of the phenomenon.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do I need to start using antifreeze, even in the summer?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As always, it's your car.  You need to make the call.  I can't be bothered to flush out my coolant just to change it from green to clear.  When it's dirty, I flush it, not before.</p>

<p><em>NOTE: I know that a pressurized radiator system changes the physics from this simple ""boiling point and no higher"" explanation.  This is a reasonable first-order approximation for the purposes of discussion.</em></p>

"What happens if I drive without antifreeze in my car?","242484","","<p>What happens if I drive without antifreeze in my car (no water / no antifreeze)? This is my main question. I've added some follow up questions that are specific to my situation but for the main question I just want to know in general what happens. </p>

<p><strong>HISTORY</strong><br>
Let's say someone thought that the low antifreeze light was the low windshield washer light and drove a 12 mile trip to work and home from work in the middle of winter for a month? What happens if they drive in the summer? </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong><br>
For the record, for me, I realize now that I was driving with low antifreeze except for maybe one or two trips (of about 40). I believe a few trips I ran completely out because the temperature shot up 10 to 20 degrees over the span of a mile. I pulled over as soon as I noticed this and could pull off the road or into a gas station and added coolant. </p>

<p>I was able to take it in to get fixed. The mechanics ran pressure tests on it and found the coolant leak in the water pump. They replaced it and it's running fine since then. However, the engine seems to knock / rock very loudly sometimes at start but eventually dies down but that may have already been happening. I don't know. Anyway, no leaks. </p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong><br>
I took it to one shop and I said that I had a radiator leak. They ran pressure tests and said the radiator and water pump were leaking. I took it to a second shop and they said that only the water pump was leaking. Is the first shop's pressure tester unreliable? </p>
","<p>Without water and without antifreeze or just without antifreeze? I'll assume that you mean without either, but there is a big difference.</p>

<p>This is really simple though. The engine will overheat, quickly, and the seals and gaskets will give out, letting fluids leak in and out of places they should or shouldn't be (like the radiator and water pump, for starters). Eventually, parts of the engine will stop working all together and depending on how long you let this go on for, the engine will need to be taken apart and repaired or it may just need to be melted down for scrap metal, to put it simply.</p>

","<p>If you keep driving it that way for very long, the fuel that's pumping through the non-firing cylinder will contaminate the catalytic converter.

But once I accidentally put in the premium kind, mixing it with the unleaded that was already there, and I thought for sure my car was going to explode or something, but it turned out alright.</p>

<p>So I've just gotten to wondering what the harm is in either putting the wrong kind of gas in your car altogether (on its own), or mixing them (the three types....unleaded, premium, and premium+ or w/e it's called).</p>

<p>Lastly, what about diesel? Presumably using that in a normal car or mixing it with normal gas is a death sentence, but I don't understand exactly what would happen.</p>
","<p>In a newer car, all that would happen is that your electronic fuel management system will notice that your engine is running too lean (not enough fuel) or too rich (too much fuel) and adjust your ignition timing and fuel injection accordingly. <strong>Warning</strong>: In an older car with a carburetor (no automatic adjustment of ignition timing), you may destroy the engine for one of the reasons described below.</p>

<p>Different fuels burn at different rates, so the spark plug needs to ignite at just the right time during the ignition stroke, otherwise you don't burn all the fuel before the valves open, which could cause a backfire (if you're lucky) or could cause your engine to try to turn in the wrong direction (if you're not) because the explosion happens before the crank shaft is in the right position (called pinging), forcing it back instead of over the crest of the revolution. Or it burns too hot and melts a piston. In either case, this will eventually lead to the engine blowing a nice paper currency-sized hole in your wallet.</p>

<p>Diesel on the other hand should theoretically not ignite in a petrol/gasoline engine because diesel doesn't vaporise very well (which is why diesel is ignited by the compression of hot air under extreme pressure. Diesel engines don't even <em>have</em> spark plugs), leading to a flooding of the cylinders and a stall. But in the event that the diesel actually ignites, the most likely scenario is that the engine will run rather rough and sputter a lot before finally dying and flooding, possibly bending or snapping one or more connection rods.</p>

<p>Question is: Why does the water drips? What is the source of it? And what does it signify?</p>
","<p>It signifies that the car is running absolutely correct. Here is the reason why:</p>

<p>A gasoline (petrol) molecule is made up as such:</p>

<p>C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>18</sub> (or 8 Carbon atoms and 18 Hydrogen atoms)</p>

<p>Energy is obtained from the combustion of it by the conversion of a hydrocarbon to carbon dioxide and water. The combustion of octane follows this reaction:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2 C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>18</sub> + 25 O<sub>2</sub> → 16 CO<sub>2</sub> + 18 H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or better said, you have two of the hydrocarbon atoms along with 25 oxygen atoms, they swirl together into a mix, the spark plug ignites them, boom, and out the tail pipe comes 16 carbon dioxide molecules and <strong>18 water molecules</strong> ... at least in a perfect world. Some cars don't put out exactly that ratio. There may be a little bit of carbon monoxide (CO), unburnt hydrocarbons (C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>18</sub>), and/or nitrogen oxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) coming out of the engine exhaust port along with the CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O. In this case, the catalytic convertor's job is to help clean these up so you can get closer to the perfect ratio described above.</p>

<p>As described, the water coming out of the tail pipe is a natural occurrence of the combustion process. You will usually see it coming out of the tail pipe when the engine and exhaust system of the vehicle is not completely warmed up. When it does become completely warmed up, you won't see it any more, because it comes out as steam (well, you'll see it in the winter time if it's cold enough, but you get the idea). </p>

<li>This question also has a framework of what happens internally to an engine and what the side effects are as well as component of what the fundamental differences are regarding effects when compared to lack of oil</li>
<li>Also, I asked this question in order to build a theoretical understanding of the problem. The other page suggests how to fix an overfilled engine (practical application)</li>
</ul>
","<p>With way too much engine oil in the engine, the problem is that the crankshaft can hit the oil in the bottom of the crankcase when the engine is running.  Since the crankshaft is spinning fast, even at idle, each time it slaps the surface of the oil, it will create some bubbles in the oil as the air just behind the spinning crankshaft lobe gets dragged under the surface of the oil.  It doesn't take long to get a whole lot of bubbles and the engine oil becomes all frothy and full of bubbles.  </p>

<p>Since all oil pumps are designed to pump liquid rather than (compressible) gas, even though the pump is still operating, it's literally sucking air instead of pumping vital engine oil.  The net effect is that the oil doesn't get delivered to the places it's supposed to go, so a gross excess of engine oil can <strong>kill your engine</strong> by the <em>exact same cause</em> as not having enough engine oil.  </p>

<p>With that said, if you put in, say, a quart too much, it's probably not going to be a problem (depending on the type and capacity of the engine).

"what is difference between DOHC and SOHC?","216249","","<p>I want to know the SOHC and DOHC configurations. On what factors an engine manufacturer decides to go with SOHC or with DOHC, what should I choose? DOHC or SOHC?</p>
","<p>For those who don't know, SOHC and DOHC refer to the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>SOHC - Single Over Head Cam</li>
<li>DOHC - Double Over Head Cam</li>
</ul>

<p>A cam refers to a ""cam shaft"" or the thing which goes bump in the night. The cam has a ""bump"" or ""hump"" in it which actuates the valves which allows air into and exhaust out of the cylinder of the engine at the correct time so the engine will run correctly.</p>

<p>As for the configurations themselves, in SOHC configurations, the camshaft is placed on top of the head. Here is an example:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AdKJw.jpg"" alt=""SOHC Head Picture pulled from Google Images""></p>

<p>The wheel at the right of the picture is what the cam belt rides on. This wheel is attached to the cam itself. The cam, then actuates the rocker arms which you can see are pointing to either side of the head. This is an example of a 3-valve per cylinder head (2-intake and 1-exhaust per cylinder). The 2-valve per cylinder is a much mor prevalent configuration.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a DOHC:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/X6BHu.jpg"" alt=""DOHC image pulled from google images""></p>

<p>In this example, you can see there are two separate cam shafts riding atop the head. For DOHC heads, the cams can be tied together with a short chain, then have a separate chain/belt which drives the cams, or can have just a single chain/belt which runs the whole thing. DOHC engines usually have a configuration of 2-intake and 2-exhaust valves per cylinder, but in some cases like the configuration Volkswagen-Audi Group (VAG) uses a five valve per cylinder (3-intake and 2 exhaust). In most cases, the cam directly actuates the valve without the use of a rocker arm (it may or may not have a ""lifter"" between the cam and the valve).</p>

<p>The whole purpose of having OHC configurations is to do away with another form of valve actuation, that of pushrods found in the Over Head Valve (OHV), which is found in most American V8 configurations (Ford uses an OHC version for their motors). OHV configurations use a centrally located cam shaft (central to the engine block), and actuates the valves through the use of lifters, pushrods, and rocker arms. The OHC configuration does away with most of this for the reduction of mass in the valve train. This reduction of mass usually means the engine can run safer and cleaner at higher engine speeds due to less inertial pressures on the valve train. Also, since this is more of a direct actuation of the valves, there is less flex (due to push rods) and a more accurate valve actuation occurs. The trade off in this is that the belts/chains/guides which controls all of this usually wear out over a period of time well before the engine's end of life (EOL), where as on an OHV engine, the valve train and timing chain usually will last until the engine is worn out. The OHC configuration is a lot more complex than the OHV in that there are a more parts which can go bad, which can cause catastrophic consequences if it fails. OHC engines are usually ""interference motors"", which means the valves and the pistons occupy the same space at different times. If the cam belt/chain fails, the valves stop moving, but the pistons do not (right away). The piston will move up into the valves and usually destroy the valves and the entire head assembly. It is imperative that the cam belt/chain maintenance get done on time. There are no warning signs (without taking the engine apart) to tell you when it is worn out, so following the manufacturers replacement interval is very important.</p>

<p>As discussed, the DOHC engines usually have more valves per cylinder than the SOHC versions. They will also usually have less parts involved (most DOHC directly actuate the valves, where SOHC usually have rocker arms). More valves means the engine can intake and exhaust more gasses from the engine. Think of a large circle, say one which is 4"" across (or say 10cm for you unruly metric folks out there). How many 2"" (5cm) circles can you fit within it? The answer is two. Now take the same 4"" circle and fit 1.5"" circles within it. The number is somewhere around four. A 4"" circle has the area of 12.57in/sq. A 2"" circle has the area of 3.14 in/sq, and therefor two of those would equate to 6.28 in/sq. With the 1.5"" circle, your total would be 7.07 in/sq. (Note: While I'm not sure if four could fit in the circle exactly, the example is valid for educational purposes.) Now imagine these circles are the valves in the cylinder head. The more valves you can fit into the head, the greater the surface area you can cover. The greater surface area allows greater air/exhaust flow into and out of the cylinder. This gives the engine a chance at better <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volumetric_efficiency"" rel=""noreferrer"">volumetric efficiency</a> or VE (basically how well the cylinder fills with the air/fuel mixture). This allows for greater performance from the engine.</p>

<p>Manufactures might choose SOHC over DOHC engines due to cost in design and manufacture. They might choose DOHC over SOHC for the performance aspect. I'm sure there are other reasons.</p>

<p>What should you do? This site isn't really for giving you my opinion about what you should choose. Basically I would tell you to find vehicles which are within your cost and performance goals. Select several versions of each, test drive them, then make up your own mind. Both OHC versions have a maintenance schedule which should be met with impunity. Other than that, have fun!</p>

"Car shakes when in gear at red light","215023","","<p>I bought a '96 Toyota Camry about a month ago.</p>

<p>When I first turn the car on and the engine is cold, I can have the car stopped (in gear) and it will not shake. The idle RPMs will be at 1000.</p>

<p>After the car has heated up, I notice the idle RPM drop by about 250, and the steering wheel/car begin to rumble and shake. If I keep my foot on the brake and then tap the gas just enough to raise the RPMs back to 1000, the shaking stops.</p>

<p>In neutral or park (it's an automatic vehicle) the shaking diminishes but the RPMs do not rise from 750.</p>

<p>I was told the car had good even compression in the cylinders when I bought it from the dude, but you never know. Ideas?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>I have a similar problem and haven't been able to figure it out yet, but here are the things I have tried and plan to try in the future. Some have helped marginally, some not at all, but they might work great in your case. If I left anything out, I'd love feedback!</p>

<ol>
<li>First thing to check is the engine and transmission mounts. If the engine shakes they are likely bad and need replacing  (regardless of whether they are the cause or just a symptom) and that might fix your problem right there. An easy way to check the mounts is to have someone run the car while you're watching the engine with the hood open. Have the person rev the engine up and change between gears. If the engine jumps up and down at any of these actions one or more mounts is broken and needs fixed.</li>
<li>Next, make sure your computer is not throwing any codes. If it is, this could save you a LOT of time. This case is usually hard to miss since it is (at least on my car) always accompanied by a check engine light on the dash.</li>
<li>Spark problems: check your spark plugs or just outright replace them. Check your spark plug wires for resistance below 20KOhm and check for spark.</li>
<li>Check the compression in the cylinders yourself, unless you trust the previous owner. No real reason to do all other hard work if this test fails. </li>
<li>Dirty injectors/fuel system: try fuel system cleaners, see if that makes a difference. If it does, but not enough, you might need to do more serious work on the fuel line and injectors.</li>
<li>Dirty/bad air intake components. Clean your throttle body, valves (especially the IAC), someone even suggested a full scrub of the whole intake manifold, something that is probably worth it anyway if you have the time (this is one of the things I plan on doing soon). Also check for vacuum leaks.</li>
<li>Measure the ripple voltage that's coming from the alternator. Use the AC setting on a multimeter across the battery to do this while the engine is running (do NOT disconnect you battery while the car is running though!)</li>
<li>Check the bearings that the various belts run over. I don't know how to do this other than listen to the bearings, but it makes sense that a bad bearing could put uneven load on the engine, especially at low RPM, and throw things out of whack.</li>
</ol>

<p>Good luck and let us know what you find!</p>

"Slow Accleration And Moving RPMs","214549","","<p><b>UPDATE</b>: I bought a scan tool and downloaded the torque app. I don't get any error codes. I decided to drive it again today. I drove about a quarter mile and barely got to 20MPH. I turned around and pushed the gas pedal to the floor and car never made it above 25 MPH in about a quarter mile. The RPMs fluttered a bit, between 2000 RPM and 3200 RPM with the gas pushed down all the way. I parked the car and there were some strange smells. I am not sure how to describe them, at one point almost the burning rubber.</p>

<hr>

<p>I own a 2001 Pontiac Grand Prix. Last week it started accelerating very slowly when pushing on the gas. Going about 20 MPH I pushed the gas to the floor and almost nothing happened. The RPMs did not go above 3000. The RPMs also got a shaky and moved back a forth a bit.</p>

<p>On the highway the car slowly got up to 45 MPH and 3500 RPM, then it was stuck there for about 15 seconds - it would not go any faster and RPMs would not go higher. After those 15 seconds it finally went above 3500 and got up to 60. Once at 60 everything seemed normal, normal RPMs and no weird sounds.</p>

<p>The next thing I tried was in neutral. I pushed the gas down all the way and it went to about 3500 RPM. Keeping the gas pushed the down the same amount, the RPMS slowly fell to about 2500 RPMs before I let off.</p>

<p>Could anyone give me advice on basic ways to troubleshoot this? I checked the transmission oil after letting my car warm up and it was low (just under the whole OK marker). I don't know if this would cause these symptoms, but was not sure what else to check. </p>

<p>The only check engine light has been on for a long time and must have a bad sensor. I have a low engine coolant light, but I have checked it a few times and even added to it and it seems to be at the correct level.</p>

<p>EDITS: Automatic transmission. The CEL is for ""Low engine coolant"".</p>
","<p>It sounds like the catalytic converter might be plugged. If it has self destructed, it could be causing a blockage and not allowing your engine to exhaust the gasses as it should, thus not allowing the engine to rev as high as it normally should. You can test it by tapping it with a hammer (not hard) and listening to see if there is a rattling sound. A muffler shop can diagnose this for you, as well as fix it if needed.</p>

"Is the ECON button just a placebo?","199208","","<p>I recently bought a Honda Civic that had this in the car: </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/N57qS.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I have no idea what it does, and how it's supposed to help. Even Honda's website is ambiguous, just using a lot of fuzzy words to describe what it does. <a href=""http://owners.honda.com/vehicles/information/2014/Civic-Sedan/features/Eco-Assist-System/4"" rel=""noreferrer"">From the website</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Econ Button and Eco Assist™ System</strong></p>
  
  <p>With the exception of the Si models, all Civics are equipped with the
  Econ Button™ to help enhance your fuel efficiency while driving. The
  Ecological Drive Assist System (Eco Assist™) is a fuel efficiency
  information system designed to help you develop and maintain a
  fuel-efficient driving style. The system monitors driving style, and
  can display the impact of your driving style on the vehicle’s fuel
  efficiency. This feedback can help you make adjustments to take full
  advantage of the fuel efficiency potential of the Civic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is it some sort of placebo effect? It says it's supposed to help me improve driving, in conjunction with good road habits.  But what is it actually doing when I push that button?</p>
","<p>The ECON button is not a placebo, though the wording from that specific web page is a bit vague. </p>

<p>The key is that the ECON button and the Eco-Assist system are two separate things. </p>

<p><a href=""http://automobiles.honda.com/civic-hybrid/fuel-efficiency.aspx"">According to Honda</a>, pressing the ECON button configures your car to improve mileage at the cost of performance. Turning it off will improve power and reduce mileage, which you might want to do when driving in the mountains, for example. </p>

<p>Economy modes like this with vehicles typically work by making changes to both the engine and drivetrain to improve efficiency while reducing power. </p>

<p>Examples of ways to do this include changing the speed at which the automatic transmission shifts into higher gears, advancing or retarding engine timing, restricting the amount of air and fuel admitted to the engine, and in some cases even completely <a href=""http://www.volkswagen.co.uk/technology/petrol/active-cylinder-technology-act"">shutting off one or more cylinders in the engine.</a></p>

<p>In the case of the Honda Civic, I found reference to the following <a href=""http://www.dowhonda.com/blog/index.php/should-i-press-the-econ-button/"">specific changes with ECON mode</a>. </p>

<ul>
<li>Gentler throttle: Limits how much the throttle opens when you press
on the gas pedal.  </li>
<li>More efficient shifting: The automatic transmission shifts into
higher gears sooner, which means slower acceleration but better fuel
economy</li>
<li>Reducing the length of time the air conditioner runs</li>
</ul>

<p>Effectively this means the ECON mode limits your ability to waste gas by making it impossible to do certain wasteful things. It might be possible to achieve the same efficiency with manual driving, but it would not be easy. </p>

<p>The Eco-Assist system is a separate system which uses color-changing lights on your dash to help you monitor the efficiency of your driving style. Rapid acceleration, riding the brakes, and other silly driving habits will make the dash indicators blue. A more efficient driving style will cause them to glow green. The more green you see, the better your mileage will be.</p>

"What can cause a car to consume more fuel?","193146","","<p>All over my long driver career, I had 4 cars (5 years).</p>

<p>I always compare my fuel consumption with other people who have the same car. 3 times out of 4, I found out that my cars were consuming more fuel then others (I like buying car in poor condition since they cost nothing and I repair them).</p>

<p>So I think it might be interesting to list here what can cause a car to consume more fuel (not specific to a brand) as I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who wonder about that.</p>

<p>Also, it would be interesting when listing an Idea to describe how it can influence the fuel consumption and also if this could make a ""noticeable"" difference or not ?</p>
","<p>The most common causes (aside from poor driving habits) are</p>

<ul>
<li>bad timing</li>

<p>*Cars designed for low octane fuel won't benefit from high octane fuel, but cars designed for high octane fuel will perform poorly on lower octanes.</p>

"Reasons for loss of radiator fluid","193034","","<p>I've had to top up my car's radiator fluid twice in the last month after discovering that the expansion tank (plastic container where one usually tops up) had completely drained out (roughly a gallon). The first time, I noticed a puddle of coolant under my car in the morning. I live in a hot climate and make heavy use of the A/C.</p>

<p>What possible reasons could cause radiator fluid to overflow? It looks like there is too much pressure inside the cooling system. Is this symptomatic of a clogged line or something else? If so, what action could be taken to minimize/eliminate loss of coolant?</p>

<p>My car has an LS1 engine, in case that matters.</p>
","<p>I doubt the fluid is overflowing.   You most likely have a leak somewhere.</p>

<p>Common locations:</p>

<ul>
<li>The plastic container that you top off has a leak.  (Check underneath it for puddles, also make sure the hose between it and the radiator is not leaking).</li>
<li>Radiator (Look on the bottom for drips, it is typically behind the grill in front of the engine)</li>
<li>Water Pump (This one can be harder to spot leaks with, normally is powered by a belt and has at least one large hose if not two between it and the radiator)</li>
<li>One of the cooling hoses (You can give them a little squeeze to see if they are hardening up and to see if fluid leaks out anywhere.  You should be replacing the upper/lower radiator hoses occasionally as it is, so definitely give them a check if you haven't replaced them in the last few years.)  </li>
<li>Head Gasket or other engine gasket (harder to spot, check the other places first and look for oil in the coolant)</li>
<li>Radiator cap </li>

"How long does it take for gas to go bad?","189926","","<p>Approximately how long does it take for unleaded gasoline in the tank and fuel lines to become unusable in a car that is not being used?  What causes this, and what can be done to prevent or remedy the issue?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>  The car that prompted this question ('96 Lincoln Mark VIII, parked for about 6-9 months without preparation) has started successfully.  The engine <em>really</em> seems like it doesn't like the gas, but it runs.</p>
","<p>I left my Mazda Protege unused in my garage for over a year, and the fuel filter was clogged when I went to start it again. It started fine, but would not rev and was basically undriveable. I'm sure it wasn't great for the fuel injectors, too. Also, I once bought a motorcycle with 10 year old gas in the tank, and the bike wouldn't run at all. I could hear a cylinder occasionally fire, but the gas was totally unusable. I poured it into a metal bucket and lit it on fire. The carbs were very badly gummed up and clogged, too, and had to be torn apart and soaked in carb cleaner.</p>

<p>If you use STA-BIL you can store gas for over a year without issue. Just make sure you run the engine for a few minutes to circulate the STA-BIL through the car. Once gas goes slightly bad, you can still use it if you put a little (1 gallon) in an (almost) full tank of fresh gas. The stuff I pulled out of the motorcycle was much darker than normal, and smelled so bad that I didn't even consider using it in an engine.</p>

<p>If you're planning to store a vehicle for a very long time, it makes sense to spend the time to totally drain the fuel system. It's cheaper than replacing the fuel system, later on, due to dried up, gummy gas deposits.</p>

<p>Here is some info I found on the STA-BIL website:</p>

<p>Q: How long will STA-BIL Fuel Stabilizer keep fuel fresh? </p>

<p>A: For 12 months when mixed into fresh gasoline. Doubling the dosage will keep fuel fresh for up to 2 years.</p>

<p>He ended up driving around for quite some time just to try to ensure that he was safe - but how long is really necessary?</p>
","<p>The question really is what the voltage was just before the jump start. A jump start is nothing more than get the engine running from another battery. If the engine runs again, the alternator/dynamo will charge the partly depleted battery again.</p>

<p>Nobody can tell how long you need to drive to get the battery fully loaded again, as this depends on the state of the battery (old battery might need longer charging time), weather conditions (warm weather + warm engine = faster charging time), the !very dynamic! throttle position (high revs = more engine turns = more dynamo turns = faster charging), type of dynamo (big one = faster charging), electricity running from the battery (lights - A/C - fans - radio,..) , and finally type of engine (diesel engine = less load on battery while the engine runs = quicker charging).</p>

<p>To make sure you get the battery all juiced up prior to shutting of the engine, you need to turn all electricity off - lights - A/C - fans - radio etc.. Then you could either leave the car running on the driveway, or take it for a spin.</p>

<p>My suggestion would be to get in the car and drive for at least about half an hour - again totally depending on the depletion level - , while taking the things above into account. If you come back from your joyride -please- don't test if the car starts again  and shut it off immedeately afterwards. This temporary huge load on the battery might leave it with just too less juice for your next start. Instead, just leave the car as is and hope the next time it will start again when you need to use your car :)</p>

"Does Downshifting (Engine Braking) Cause Extra Wear and Tear?","184061","","<p>Does the act of downshifting to slow your vehicle down have any negative side affects?</p>

This process makes my brakes last much longer but I'd like to ensure it's not at the cost of something else.</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit:<br>
Thanks everyone for your answers, but I'm seeing very conflicting information.  I found this on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine_braking"">wikipedia</a> but then again it's wikipedia.  Does anyone have anything to support their thought one way or another?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Engine braking passively reduces wear on brakes and helps a driver
  maintain control of the vehicle. Active use of engine braking
  (shifting into a lower gear) is advantageous when it is necessary to
  control speed while driving down very steep and long slopes. It should
  be applied before regular disk or drum brakes have been used, leaving
  the brakes available to make emergency stops. The desired speed is
  maintained by using engine braking to counteract the gravitational
  acceleration.</p>
</blockquote>
","<p>Most of the time when you drive, you're putting a load (and causing wear) on what I'm going to call the ""forward"" face of each tooth on each gear in your drivetrain.  The front of a tooth on the crankshaft pushes against the back of a tooth on the next gear in line, which pushes the next gear, etc.  When you use ""engine braking"", all you are doing is engaging the teeth in the opposite direction, and putting force and wear on the faces that normally are just along for the ride.</p>

<p>Now, does that mean you're wearing your engine out faster?  Marginally... but the parts you're wearing out would normally have to be replaced (if at all) because they'd worn out from the other side; you're wearing surfaces that would usually be thrown out with hardly any wear at all.  To borrow a phrase from the medical field, your engine/transmission will die <strong>with</strong> that wear, not <strong>of</strong> it.  </p>

<p>To the people who say that you're transferring the wear from your brakes to your clutch, all I can say is... you're doing it wrong!  If you downshift as quickly and smoothly as you upshift, then the added wear and tear on your clutch will be a statistical blip - seriously, how many times do you downshift for this reason, as opposed to normal shifting?  (If your answer is ""at every light"", then the poster who advised you to calm down your driving habits had a point.)</p>

<p>Having said that, there's a seriously <em>wrong</em> way to do this; I used to do it when I was first learning to drive stick, and it was incredibly stupid:  pushing the clutch all the way in and letting the RPMs fall to idle, then letting the clutch out and allowing the engine to slow the car down in the same gear.  If that's how you're doing it, <strong>STOP IT!</strong>  That way wears out the clutch very fast (which might be what the other posters had in mind), drops your speed dramatically without lighting up your brakelights (I confess, that's why I started doing it - trying to sneak-slow past a cop), and runs a high risk of stalling the engine and seriously ^&amp;*@ing something up.  Don't be that guy.</p>

</ul>
","<p>There is probably one of several things wrong with your S10. I think @Hash_Brown is on the right track.</p>

<p>First, it might be an exhaust leak. It's amazing how the puffing of exhaust coming out where it's not supposed to sounds like a ""tick"". This can also cause a lean bank check engine code to appear. This is because it will actually draw air in as well as the puffing out of exhaust. This has to do with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli&#39;s_principle"" rel=""nofollow"">Bernoulli's Principle</a> I believe. </p>

<p>Second, it could be a sticky lifter or valve. With as many miles on your truck as you have, this would not be out of the question. If the one or both of these are sticking, you could possible get it clear up with some <a href=""http://seafoamsales.com/sea-foam-motor-treatment/"" rel=""nofollow"">SeaFoam</a> or the like. Following the directions on the can, you can add about 1/3 of the can to the crank case and run the engine up to temperature. This will clean out the gunk from the lifters and allow the oil to flow more freely as well as allowing the lifters and valves to move around better as well. These directions may be a bit off because I have not used it in this manner in a while, so ensure you follow the directions. You do not want to leave it in your crank case for an extended period of time. Nothing past 100 miles is what I've been told in the past I'm pretty sure. It can also be used in the gas tank to help free up noisy injectors. <strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> I will warn you, doing this also cleans all of the carbon off of the oil control rings and out from the bearings and wherever else it may be hiding. While you may think this is a good thing, as engines get older and build up the carbon, it actually helps to keep oil usage at bay. When you clean these deposits out, it will actually allow your engine to burn oil and you'll have the tell tale sign of blue smoke coming out of the tail pipe.</p>

<p>You <em>could</em> possibly try a rocker adjustment, but I would bet this is not the problem. If you have a dead lifter (one which no longer springs back), adjusting the rockers will not solve the issue. This would require you replace the lifters. At your mileage, you'd just want to do a rebuild at this point, since you'd have the top end of your engine apart anyway. Once the lifters are set, they very rarely need an adjustment. I'm assuming you have the 4.3L V6 engine (I don't think they ran the S10 with a 4-cyl and 4x4). The 4.3L is basically a Small Block Chevy (SBC Gen I) engine with two cylinders cut off. To adjust these rockers, you do not use a feeler gauge. If you've never done it before, I would get a friend who has to help you so you'll understand, but here's the basics:</p>

<ul>
<li>Remove your valve covers</li>
<li>Move the engine so it is top dead center on the #1 piston on the compression stroke</li>
<li>Both your intake and exhaust push rods should be able to spin</li>
<li>Back the rocker nut off a full turn on your intake side</li>
<li>While spinning the push rod between your fingers, tighten your intake rocker until the push rod <em>just</em> stops spinning, then give it another 1/2 of a turn</li>
<li>Do the same for your exhaust rocker arm</li>
<li>Then do the same for the exhaust valves of cylinders No. 5 and 6 and the intake valves of cylinders No. 2 and 3 </li>
<li>When done, turn the engine over (by hand with a socket wrench at the crank) 360 degrees</li>
<li>Then do the same for the exhaust valves of cylinders No. 2, 3 and 4 and the intake valves of cylinders No. 4, 5 and 6</li>
<li>Button the valves covers back down</li>
</ul>

<p>You can follow <a href=""http://youtu.be/89o5rLpbCgI?t=1m6s"" rel=""nofollow"">this video on YouTube</a> as it is fairly decent, but shows a V8, not your V6. (I have timed the video to 1'6"" which is the meat and potatoes portion of what you need to be watching, but go back and watch the whole thing if you like.)</p>

<p>An example I can think of might be - an aftermarket car stereo may not have surge/voltage protection and it may be connected directly to the battery, not through the ignition switch, so connecting 12v across it the wrong way may damage it.

"Can this tire sidewall damage be repaired or should I replace the tire?","154103","","<p>I* hit a curb and got a small tear in the front passenger side tire.

<li>Tire deflation (cannot be legally repaired in most countries)</li>
<li>You pull the flap back and see damage to the side wall plies (corded area under the rubber which supports the tire) whether deflation has occurred or not</li>
<li>Bulging of the tire at the damage site</li>

<p>As a side note (and primarily my opinion with nothing to really back it up), the area where your damage has occurred seems to be extra rubber put in place on low profile tires to help protect the rims from curb rash. Yours looks like it was a little more serious of a curb encounter, but still, if no issues as stated above, you should be fine.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> If the flap of rubber sticking out bothers you (aesthetically), use a small amount of rubber cement to it and it should keep it in place. It really isn't bothering anything the way it is.</p>

Those 2 alone can cost $500-1000 depending on the car.  Used parts are not typically available (and if they are, they're usually not reliable anyways 'cause A/C parts are so easily damaged).

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OqPhH.jpg"" alt=""coolant spillover tank""></p>
","<p>What you are describing is usually caused by a weak radiator cap. Weak meaning it is no longer holding the pressure which is needed inside the system. Since you said you just replaced the cap, having just water in the system will lower the boiling point and may cause over pressure in the system. You'll also want to ensure you have the entire system burped of all air, which also causes hot spots inside the engine. Easiest way to do this is to fill it from the radiator with the front of the truck pointing uphill.</p>

<p>When you do get this fixed, you'll need to ensure you drain the entire system to get the tap water out. Then you'll want to refill with 50/50 mix which utilizes distilled water instead of tap water, which will introduce minerals and contaminants into the system which degrades it over time.</p>

","<p>The answer is NO.  It is never a good idea to replace a single tire, because each tire has different performance characteristics.

"Possible reasons for loss of power, engine shaking, and smell of liquid fuel (not burning)?","136539","","<p>The car (Renault Megane 1998 1.6e hatchback) lost power (about 500rpm in a bursty rhythm) after I re-ignited on a traffic light, the engine started shaking, and I could smell liquid fuel. There was no obvious place where the fuel could have dripped from. I left the car and checked for any marks on the ground later. About two hours later the car started and ran OK. Then after a few more hours of rest it ran OK again for a few miles, but after a brief stop when I ignited while the engine was hot it started shaking and smelling like fuel again. My first guess would be spark plugs, but I'm afraid of something more serious. What else could be the reason?</p>

<p>UPDATE:
Checked the spark plugs -- not them. I have some suspicion about bad fuel as I filled about 5L of petrol the day before.</p>

<p>UPDATE:
I tried pulling the the ignition leads from the engine side during the faulty running of the engine. I didn't dare pull them all the way out, but an inch was just about enough to hear the distinctive sound of a spark jumping to the plug. Two of them (1 and 4) failed to produce that sound. I've ordered ignition leads, so I'll soon find out of they were the problem.</p>

<p>I also had another experience I tried driving the car with the engine shaking and about 500 down the road after I stepped on the gas quite hard, it started working properly again.</p>
","<p>Firstly, what car is it? (Make, model, year).</p>

<p>Is the fuel smell more pronounced around the engine bay (suggesting a leak) or around the exhaust (suggesting unburnt fuel)?</p>

<p>Shaking and low power suggests, as you suspect, that it isn't running on all cylinders (which would result in unburnt fuel coming out the exhaust). If it is only doing so when hot, my first thought would be either the HT leads or coil(s). </p>

<p>If it is an older car with a single coil, a distributor, and a separate lead to each spark plug, then, when it is playing up, disconnect each in turn and see what happens. If one or two are failing, it will run just the same with the failing ones disconnected, but worse or not at all with the others disconnected. In this case, replace the whole set. Note that they carry a very high voltage, so DON'T play with them with the engine running! (or wear insulating gloves if you do) - As they get old, the insulation degrades, and they can give a nasty shock.</p>

<p>If it's a newer car with a separate coil pack for each cylinder, then again it could be a failure of one or more coil packs, and I believe a similar technique can be used to test them, although I've not tried that...</p>

If something is drawing power, it's something that isn't immediately noticeable.</p>

<p>While a typical car is off, how many amps does it pull from the battery?</p>
","<p>Not sure what it ""should"" be pulling, but anywhere near a whole amp is way too much and will drain the battery in no time. Are you sure you tested right? Often the pull when you first connect the battery can be a lot higher than the steady pull since you might be charging some capacitors, etc. If it stays that high you definitely have a problem, possibly a partial short.</p>

"Horrific squealing when car is first turned on?","129731","","<p>This is a really classic and common old car problem. I see it <em>all the time</em> but this is the first time it's started happening to my own car.</p>

<p>Basically when I first turn the car on, there's instantly a pretty horrific squealing that sounds belt-related, and develops to an even higher pitch as I pull out of my parking spot before cutting off as I straighten out and drive away.</p>

<p>Thereafter, there's just a slight squeak you can hear in the engine when it idles or I'm traveling at a low speed.</p>

<p>What could be the issue? I drive a 97 Subaru Legacy. The main belts are brand new.</p>
","<p>It sounds like your alternator has not been tightened enough and the serpentine belt is slipping because of it. Since you have new belts on your engine, this is probably about the only thing which it can be. If you press on the belt with your thumb at the center of the long portion of the belt (between pulleys), you should get no more than about 1/2"" inch of deflection. If there is more than this, it's too loose. Here is a picture of where you should tighten it at (I believe this should look like your engine and belt setup):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/EtKnJ.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>To tighten, loosen the two bolts, circled in red, then turn the yellow circled bolt clockwise to tighten the belt. Don't forget to tighten the two red circled bolts after you tighten the belt.</p>

<p>If, after you tighten it up it is still squeaking some, get some belt dressing for it. Belt dressing is a spray on treatment you put on the rib side of the belt.</p>

I have heard of using both Coke and baking soda to clean battery clamps and I personally used both methods and each one worked great.</p>

<p>During discussion on this subject with my coworkers, somebody brought up the point that <strong>myth busters</strong> tried it on their shows and came up with the following conclusion.</p>

<p><em>""Test 7 - Cola can clean battery terminals: Adam and Jamie pit cola against baking soda and a toothbrush on two dirty car batteries.

<p>So is there any point of spending money to buy special cleaner or using coke or baking soda when it should be possible just to clean it with plain water? Has anyone tried of cleaning it with plain water and does it work the same? If it does should cold, warm or hot water should be used.</p>

<p>When I drove semi-trucks I remember seeing some sort of grease that was always put on battery terminals. Therefore to extend original question one step further: <strong><em>Should any lubricants be used after cleaning it to protect it?</em></strong> </p>
","<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>If you have to clean your battery terminals <em>right now</em>, you have to use the tools available to you.  You're going to want to be mindful of these facts:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The corrosion deposits can be obnoxious to remove.  Baking soda and the acid in a soda both might help dissolve the deposits.  If these deposits are not serious, water might be sufficient (although why are you cleaning the terminals if they're not covered with junk?).  Regardless, a stiff brush is helpful to remove anything that doesn't easily dissolve.</p></li>
<li><p>The battery is chock full of sulfuric acid (that's one of the reasons that corrosion deposits form).  Are you certain that none of that acid is going to be in your work area?  If so, you're possibly fine using plain water or acidic soda.  If not, you're wiser to work with a base as a corrosion remover (e.g., baking soda).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In the end, it's going to be your call.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should any lubricants be used after cleaning it to protect it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This question refers to the common practice of adding grease to the terminals prior to tightening the clamps.  The grease in question is acting as a displacer, not a lubricant.  Specifically, you're trying to reduce the ability of the acidic gasses to reach the terminals.  This isn't magic but it will slow corrosion.</p>

"What is the best way to remove a stuck/rusted exhaust bolt?","128464","","<p>I'm trying to disassemble the exhaust system on a 2000-2003 Nissan Maxima and I'm having trouble removing one last bolt. It's got a 14mm head and its just plain STUCK. I've tried soaking it overnight with PB Blaster, then the next morning I tried removing it with a 2ft long breaker bar + a 2ft extension. After making absolutely positive I was trying to turn it the proper direction, I braced myself by putting both feet on a framerail and pushing with all my strength. And then, my socket shattered into a billion pieces.  Bolt: 1 Me:0.</p>
","<p>My general rule for exhaust bolts/nuts is to order new ones with the part you are replacing, knowing full well that there is a good chance you'll destroy the ones you are removing. Better to be prepared ahead of time than to be stuck waiting for new parts from another country after you've disassembled everything. Personally, I have a rule of ordering every bolt and nut that is attached to the exhaust member I'll be replacing. Even if there isn't much rust, I never know when a bolt will snap.</p>

<p>First task is to let the exhaust completely cool. It's possible that the parts are made of different types of metal which expand and contract at different rates. </p>

<p>Now, how to get the rusted bolts off:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use an impact wrench. Sometimes the vibration and hammering action works better to ""knock"" a bolt loose, compared to wrench/breaker bar. In my experience, this is the first tool of choice for 95% of techs working on an exhaust system.</li>
<li>Use a big breaker bar. 2 ft is okay, 4 ft is more like it. Use high quality, name brand tools that won't flex or shatter on you (or at least give you free replacements when they do shatter). The flexing is important. If the cheap breaker bar is flexing instead of transferring the full torque, you may as well not have it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes there is just too much material rusted off of the bolt for either of the above to work. Or one of the above techniques may round out the bolt before it comes out. In this case, the bolt needs to be destroyed so you can move on with life. Some options are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Die grinder with appropriate wheel.</li>
<li>Hacksaw / airsaw.</li>
<li>Air hammer with chisel bit.</li>
<li>In extreme cases, torch.</li>
</ul>

<p>As always, use high temperature anti-seize when putting in the new bolts. They will go in easier, and the next person down the road will thank you.</p>

<p>Safety Note: All of the above methods assume you know the safety procedures for the tool. Of particular importance is having the vehicle properly raised on the car lift. Some of these methods involve violently pulling stuff around, which <em>will</em> cause the car to move.</p>

"Pros/cons of higher capacity car battery?","125552","","<p>I'm shopping for a new car battery for a 1998 Subaru Outback (2.5l). For the physical dimensions, the battery has to match. But I see some variance in capacity (Ah) rating, and in price too, of course. </p>

<p>The intuition goes, as usual, ""higher is better"". The obvious advantage--if I replace my current 55Ah battery with 60Ah one, I'll be able to, say, play music with the engine off for longer, and still be able to start the car. Are there disadvantages of higher capacity though?</p>

<p>Also, apart from capacity, which, if any, of the other characteristics (CA, CCA, HCA, RCM etc.) make significant difference in practice and should be paid attention to?</p>
","<p>In most cases, the stock-size battery is correct, and that's what you should stick with.</p>

<p>A smaller battery is likely to fail you sooner, unless you live somewhere without a winter (Hilo?).</p>

<p>A larger battery is an extra expense, extra toxins, extra weight, and won't give you dramatically longer life.</p>

<p><strong>CCA</strong> (cold cranking amps) is the main thing to pay attention to. This is a measure of how much current the battery can provide at 0 deg F, as @Pangea points out. Batteries work better when they are warm, so the colder it gets, the less current it can provide. </p>

<p>Starting an engine requires a lot of current, over a very short time. Meanwhile, cold engines are harder to start, requiring more power to get them going.</p>

<p>As batteries age, their internal resistance increases, reducing CCA. Total capacity decreases at the same time. This is why a newer battery can start your car in any weather, even if you leave the headlights on overnight, while an old battery might only start the car when fully charged, in good weather.</p>

<p>Starter batteries are optimized for short-duration, high-current draws, followed immediately by recharging. They are built with thinner plates with more surface area, which speeds up the chemical reactions that release the energy. If you draw them down to 1/2 charge, and then leave them like that for a while, hard crystals will form on the plates, which won't re-desolve easily on recharging. That reduces capacity and CCA over time. So, keep your starter battery fully charged, and avoid dropping below 80% during non-starter usage.</p>

<p>(Deep-cycle batteries, like on golf carts, fork lifts, some boats, some RVs are able to tolerate being discharged deeper and left that way longer than starter batteries, but they really don't like a high-current draw like for starting an engine. Best to draw on them gently, and never below 50% if you can help it.)</p>

<p><strong>So</strong>, a regular car battery is not a good device for running appliances for a long time, without the engine running. However, a stock car stereo doesn't draw much current, so you can probably get away with it for a while without a problem. But if you leave it on all night, you may drain your starter battery enough to damage it.</p>

<p>Increasing your battery size will allow you to run those appliances for a little longer, but it's still not the right technology. </p>

<p>In an RV or boat, you have a starter battery and a separate ""house"" battery, which is deep-cycle. Then use a battery isolator switch to use only the starter to start, then recharge it, then recharge the house battery from the alternator. (You can also use the house battery to assist the starter when the starter battery is low.) Some people build these in to their cars if they have really big stereos, or a small camping setup with fridge in a van or pick-up camper.

","<p>Model number differentiates the power (and usually size of the engine) of the car. You can often expect that car with a larger model number will have better optional equipment (it is valid for BMW 7 series models, perhaps series 3 and 5 have the same tendency).

<p>Letter ""i"" indicates the car is fueled with gasoline, letter ""d"" indicates it should be fuelled with diesel. Additional letter ""L"" informs that this model is longer than regular ones (usually series 7 have a ""long"" attribute).

The headlight also works fine. I feel like the clicking noise comes from under the dashboard, but i'm not certain. What could be the possible problem?</p>
","<p>As discussed in the comments already, the clicking you hear is probably the starter solenoid. You have ruled out a weak battery being the probable cause by attempting to the jump-start the engine. This means either the power cable running directly from the battery to the starter motor is too resistive/poorly connected, or that the starter motor itself is no longer functioning. You don't specify how many miles are on the vehicle, but this is a real possibility, even on a 2007 vehicle. The failure of the starter motor could be due to the brushes making poor contact, since they wear each time the car is started. </p>

<p>If you're willing, you can try tapping on the starter motor housing with 2x4 piece of wood, a broom handle, or something similar. I was able to squeeze a few more starts out of my old starter this way. This would also pinpoint the probable cause to the starter motor. To test the power cable, you need to find a way to measure the voltage seen at the starter motor terminals, not just at the battery. It may be as simple as a loose connection on the starter motor terminals.</p>

"Brakes Smell Bad and Smoke","103576","","<p>Here's the situation:</p>

<p><strong>Initially</strong></p>

<p>Changed a wheel/tire, and snapped a hub stud.  Had to take off the brake caliper on that hub (driver's side).  No problem with that, but then all of a sudden my front end was really jumpy.  It was time to change the pads and rotors for my front disk brakes.  Also, when I put all my weight and force on the brakes it definitely went to the floor with the pedal.  I don't recall this ever happening, though I can't say for sure.</p>

<p><strong>Brake Change</strong></p>

<p>So then I changed both rotors and all pads for my front disk brakes.  I noticed that my driver side pads had very little pad left (I changed these about 9 months - 12 months ago) and my passenger side had plenty of pad left.  I would say drive side had about 1mm of pad left, and passenger side had 3.5 to 4mm of pad left.</p>

<p>I also noticed something odd.  When I was trying to compress the caliper piston on the driver's side caliper, it was extremely difficult.  I eventually got it, but it wasn't nearly as easy as the passenger side.</p>

<p><strong>After the Brake Change</strong></p>

<p>When I immediately drove the car afterwards, the front end shake was gone.  But I noticed something odd.  My driver side wheel has this awful smell, and when I got done driving it (I was hard on the brakes to test out and make sure it was stopping well, and it was) it was lightly smoking at that wheel.  I thought it might have been the brake cleaner just burning off.</p>

<p>But then a day later, the smoking and smell continued, but stopped later in the day with about 45 miles down.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>What could have been causing this?  Does it sound like my driver's side caliper is just getting stuck, causing it to ride the pads and wear them down?  Is that why it was smoking/smelling?</p>

<p>Why was the driver's side caliper piston so hard to compress with a C-Clamp?  Could the caliper be going bad?</p>

<p>Could air in the line cause the caliper to get stuck and/or go to the floor?</p>

<p>Could this possibly be a master cylinder issue?  But I would think if it was a problem at the master cylinder, it would cause an issue for both front brakes.  Am I correct in saying that the master cylinder has a connection for the front that shares the same fluid/pressure?</p>

<p>Any ideas are much appreciated.</p>

","<p>It sounds like the caliper is sticking. If the piston is sticking then you would end up with one side worn down more then the other. Also, a piston should compress with a clamp, if it is that hard then that also points to it sticking. The smoking then could be from the pads being in constant contact with the rotor (if it is in that strong of contact). You probably would also notice the vehicle pulling to the side of the sticking caliper. Air in the line would not cause nor would a bad master cylinder.</p>

","<p>That sounds very much (no, it sounds <strong>exactly</strong>) like either of two things: either the brake fluid in the master cylinder is very low, or the master cylinder has failed. If anything else were the cause (caliper or wheel cylinder failure, line leakage), then you'd find brake fluid either on the ground or on the inboard surface of one of your tires.</p>

"Why should the fuel petcock valve be turned to “Off” position when not using the vehicle?","100890","","<p>It’s mentioned in the user manual of my motorbike, that when not using the vehicle, I should turn the petrol tap (the one that has three positions “On”, “Off” and “Reserve”) to “Off” position. I don’t understand why that’s necessary (and I need to understand that for my own knowledge and because my brother won't do it unless I can give him a convincing reason)?  </p>

<p>So three questions:  </p>

<ol>
<li>Is it because petrol may evaporate or flow to the engine un-necessarily when the vehicle is parked and not used for a while (like overnight or just for an hour or two)?</li>
<li>Is it recommended to always turn off the petrol tap whenever I park my vehicle somewhere or just when I park it in the garage for the night?</li>
<li>Also, as an additional related question: Why do some people drive their bikes with the petrol tap always kept on “Reserve”? My uncle does it, but refuses to explain it.</li>
</ol>
","<p>The reason is that motorcycles traditionally have the fuel tank higher than the carburetor, and the fuel feeds with gravity alone. What risks does this introduce that necessitates a manual shutoff? Without the shutoff, if the carburetor float failed to close the valve tightly enough to stop the fuel flow, then gas would continue to trickle into the carb, overflowing the bowl and flowing down into the intake tract. If the intake valve were open, it would fill the cylinder. Then, upon attempting to start the motor, the incompressible liquid gasoline would cause a catastrophic <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolock"">hydraulic lock</a>.</p>

<p>More modern motorcycles have changed some of this in a few ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>the fuel petcock could be vacuum operated, closing with the engine off.</li>
<li>the fuel tank could be lower than the carbs, making a fuel pump necessary.</li>
<li>fuel injection has eliminated the use of carburetors and floats to control fuel flow.</li>

"Timing Chain vs. Timing Belt","100867","","<p>What is the service life of a timing chain and how does having a chain drive cam benefit from a belt drive cam and vice-versa?</p>
","<p>Belts are quieter but are often less obviously worn before they break (chains stretch and loosen, belts tend to stay tight without damaged belt teeth up until the moment they snap). Timing belts are also less complicated (chains require an oil bath). Chains are generally stronger, so vehicles with timing chains often drive more than just the cam with the timing chain. Due to stretch, when you change a chain you MUST replace all the timing gears, as the teeth will wear to match the chain stretch. While not necessary on a belt driven system, a failed gear will cause a belt failure and, depending on your engine, could be very bad, so it's generally recommended to replace all idlers and gears in a belt system, too.</p>

<p>The amount of damage caused by a belt breaking vs a chain breaking entirely depends on the type of engine. Engines with really high compression ratios (performance cars that require high-octane fuel, diesels, etc) tend to have the valves and piston heads move such that they could come into contact if the cam stops opening and closing the valves. When a piston head smashes into a valve, you ruin the head, valve, and potentially other cylinders if pieces of shattered valve travel through the air intake system to the other cylinders.</p>

<p>There's a good section on the TDI Club's FAQ about <a href=""http://www.tdiclub.com/TDIFAQ/TDiFAQ-7.html"">timing belts</a>, as that's what Volkswagon uses on all their turbo diesels. A belt breaking on a TDI is catastrophic. As far as I know, most cars use chains and compression ratios low enough that there's no risk of piston heads smashing into an open valve should the chain break. You can't retrofit a belt system to use a chain, you wouldn't want to do the reverse, but I have seen people replace belts and chains with direct gear drives.</p>

"Must I Replace All 4 Tires on an All Wheel Drive (AWD) vehicle?","99928","","<p>I have a 2005 Subaru Legacy 2.5i Wagon.</p>

<p>I just destroyed the passenger-side rear tire.</p>

<p>The tires have approx. 6/32"" tread remaining, per an informal measurement with a coin (I used this guideline from <a href=""http://www.tirerack.com/tires/tiretech/techpage.jsp?techid=51"">tirerack.com</a>)</p>

<p>These are Nokian tires, and according to the specs I found online, they have 11/32"" tread depth when new.</p>

<p>Another <a href=""http://www.tirerack.com/tires/tiretech/techpage.jsp?techid=18"">article on tirerack.com on this topic</a>, suggests that Subuaru states that the differential among tread depth should vary no more than 2/32""</p>

<p>My owner's manual does not specify the what difference in tread depth tolerance is, however they do point out that I have a dashboard indicator ""AWD"" that will flash if the vehicle is driven with tires of different diameters, and I assume, the drive train is in danger of being damaged.</p>

<p>Among my family and friends, I've received conflicting opinions regarding whether I should replace all 4 tires immediately, or if I could potentially purchase the same brand and model of tire, whose tread depth, I assume, would be 11/32"" and be different by approx. 5/32"" from the existing tires.</p>

<p>Does anyone have a definitive answer as to which option I should choose?</p>

<p>Is it true that tread-depth can influence tire circumference enough that driving my Subaru for an extended period of time would damage the drive train?</p>

  <p>CONCLUSION: I chose to replace all 4 tires with new tires, and I'm happy I did.</p>

  <p>Does anyone have a definitive answer as to which option I should
  choose?</p>

<p><strong>I do: you need matching tires.</strong>  </p>

<p>That said, it's your car and you have to make the decision.  I'd tend to replace all four.  @Paulster2 also makes a good point that you could shave down a new one to match.</p>

<p>Let's start by looking at one of the most useful paragraphs from the Tire Rack article <a href=""http://www.tirerack.com/tires/tiretech/techpage.jsp?techid=18"">that you cite</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Four-wheel drive and all-wheel drive vehicles are equipped with
  additional differentials and/or viscous couplings that are designed to
  allow momentary differences in wheel speeds when the vehicle turns a
  corner or temporarily spins a tire. However, if the differentials or
  viscous couplings are forced to operate 100% of the time because of
  mismatched tires, they will experience excessive heat and unwarranted
  wear until they fail.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What that means is that a mismatched tire won't break your drivetrain immediately.  It's more subtle than that: at least one differential will be loaded all of the time and at all operating speeds.  So, instead of managing the different rotation speeds in a relatively low speed turn, you'll be cooking your differential at highway straight line speeds.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My owner's manual does not specify the what difference in tread depth
  tolerance is, however they do point out that I have a dashboard
  indicator ""AWD"" that will flash if the vehicle is driven with tires of
  different diameters, and I assume, the drive train is in danger of
  being damaged.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's good that there's a light but, frankly, you can hear the differential being overworked if you listen for it.  On my Subaru, if I inflate the rear tires to match the front tires' pressure (approximately 4 psi up), I'll hear a distinctive high-pitched whine from the center differential every time I coast down from speed in second gear.  </p>

<p><em>Note: my car is a manual transmission WRX.  You may have different audible symptoms in other vehicles and transmissons.</em></p>

<p>In the end, the reason that the tires should match is the same reason that you shouldn't tow an AWD car (instead they should be flat-bedded).  If the back wheels are turning at speed for miles but the front ones are not, the center differential will burn itself up in short order.</p>

<p>Is one mismatched tire that extreme?  No, of course not.  It will wear your differential, make worrying sounds and affect your handling.  </p>

<p>You still have to make the call, though.</p>

"What is a rod knock?","97885","","<p>What is a rod knock? What causes a rod knock, how bad is a knocking rod, and how can I tell if a rod is knocking?</p>
","<p>To get to basics, the rod (or <em>connecting rod</em>) is the portion of the engine which connects the piston to the crankshaft. Where the rod connects to the crankshaft there is a bearing which separates the rod itself from the crank journal. The bearing is made from a softer material than the rod or the crankshaft. </p>

<p>You can see most all of the internal parts of an engine in this exploded view below.</p>

<p>The connecting rod is #7, the crank shaft is #16, piston #4, and bearing can be found marked as #8.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xWKkv.gif""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xWKkv.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>When an engine is built, there are certain gap tolerances (specific distance measured in .001"") which are built into it, the rod bearing to crankshaft journal being no different. In this case, the tolerance is there to allow a specific amount of oil through from a hole in the crankshaft journal and remain on the bearing surface. Oil films on the bearing and keeps the two parts from touching during normal engine operation. If the clearance gets too big from either wear or deformation, the oil will no longer film correctly and you will get the <em>rod knock</em>. The noise itself occurs due to metal on metal contact between the bearing and the crankshaft journal during the power stroke of the engine cycle. If the situation is <em>really bad</em> it can even be caused by the rod itself contacting the crankshaft journal (where the bearing has become out of place). The most common cause of rod knock is due to a spun bearing (bearing itself actually spins in the end of the rod so it becomes out of position). This usually happens due to rod cap stretch during abusive driving situations. It can also happen due to a lack of lubrication, either because of a lack of oil or because oil is flowing incorrectly. It can also be caused by a combination of any (or all) of the three.</p>

<p>A rod knock is a <em>very serious</em> issue with the engine. As you can probably tell from my write-up, it means the engine is no longer functioning correctly. It is the <em>death knell</em> of the engine. Once the rod knock occurs, it will not cure itself. The rod bearing must either be replaced along with fixing associated parts (you don't usually replace just one rod bearing as the entire engine would need rebuilt at that point), or the engine will need to be replaced.</p>

<p>A rod knock is as described ... A low pitched knocking sound which can be heard low in the engine. It will increase in frequency as the engine speeds up, but can usually be heard at any engine speed. If you hear a knocking sound which seems to disappear after the engine warms up, it's probably <em>not</em> a rod knock. It may be something as innocuous as a leaking exhaust gasket. If you believe you have a rod knock, you should seek a second opinion from a trusted mechanic. A rod knock is an expensive fix, so you need to make sure of what it is prior to diving in head first.</p>

<p>What is engine coolant?</p>

<p><strong><em>What exactly are all of the disadvantages to running an engine when the engine coolant becomes too low?</em></strong></p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>What is engine coolant?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Engine coolant is a water and antifreeze solution. Because water has good properties as a coolant, antifreeze is used in internal combustion engines and other heat transfer applications, such as HVAC chillers and solar water heaters. The purpose of antifreeze is to prevent a rigid enclosure from bursting due to expansion when water freezes.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/p6Xts.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/p6Xts.gif"" alt=""Cooling System""></a></p>

<p>As the coolant is moved around the system by the water pump, it passes through two main components:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Radiator</strong> - The cars air intake is used to dissipate heat (which is easier across a larger surface area, higher fin density and thicker radiators - much like in PC water cooling). This is able to keep the engine coolant cool.</li>
<li><strong>Engine Block</strong> - This is the main part that the coolant is designed to wick away heat from, by flowing through engine hot spots and allowing the heat to transfer from the engine oil to the coolant as well in the process.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>What exactly are all of the disadvantages to running an engine when the engine coolant becomes too low?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just to clarify, there are no tangible advantages other than saving a tiny amount of money on engine coolant. As you will see, you should <strong><em>never do this</em></strong> due to the knock-on effect that it can cause.</p>

<h2>Disadvantages</h2>

<p>Depending on the make and model of your car some of these may not apply, but in general:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Water pump running dry</strong> - They will destroy themselves very quickly without water in them as they are not designed to run without lubrication and sufficient resistance (much like the pump in a water cooled PC).</li>
<li><strong><a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/24559/how-exactly-does-an-increase-in-engine-temperature-cause-a-car-to-breakdown"">Overheating</a></strong> - this is the main disadvantage, but this can cause a huge knock-on effect in terms of causing other damage within the engine. These include but are not limited to the following:

<ul>
<li><strong>Seized piston</strong> - The piston will expand marginally due to the heat. As the engine uses such fine tolerances, this expansion can be enough to make the piston rub hard on the cylinder casing and make the crankshaft grind to a halt! This will be <em>very</em> expensive to fix.</li>
<li><strong>Hole in the engine block</strong> - Realistically however, a lack of coolant will not cause a hole in the block. It could be caused from a thrown rod, which occurred because the piston in the engine seized during operation.</li>
<li><strong>Warping of head(s)</strong> - This can cause the <a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/24683/what-exactly-is-a-head-gasket"">head gaskets</a> to lose integrity.</li>
<li><strong>Interior car heater will lose functionality</strong> - The heater functions based on the engine coolant, as seen in the diagram above.</li>
<li><strong>Transmission failure</strong> - In some cases the transmission fluid cooler is internal to the radiator, meaning that a lack of engine coolant can not only cause the engine to overheat, but also the entire transmission.</li>
<li><strong>High pressure in hoses</strong> - Radiator/Coolant hoses can burst due to the increased pressure in the cooling system.</li>
<li><strong>Cost</strong> - To fix the damage already done to the engine at this point, it will be very expensive and you could probably justify buying a new used car instead!</li>

"What is causing this terrible grinding/groaning noise when I come to a slow stop sometimes? (but not always!)","97229","","<h2>Update 11/9/2013</h2>

<p>After a good bit of driving, the noise reoccurred. I took it back to the mechanic and we decided it must be the brake pads. They're pretty worn out, and like I said before, they're worn unevenly. Since the problem is intermittent, perhaps the pads are making an awkward angle with the rotor sometimes, leading to the grinding/groaning noise.</p>

<p>I ordered new EBC Red Stuff (ceramic) pads and EBC USR (slotted) rotors. I had the shop install them today. So far so good - no noise - but we'll have to see what happens in a thousand or so miles once the pads are fully broken in.</p>

<p>I know I can answer my own question, BTW, but I'm going to wait until the pads are broken in before I conclude the answer to the problem.</p>

<h2>Update 11/2/2013</h2>

<p>I went to a well reviewed independent auto repair shop in my area. The first thing the mechanic brought up was that my rear brakes (the drums) needed to be adjusted. The mechanic showed me how my left drum was completely stuck, whereas my right drum was too loose. After he adjusted the drums, he told me to drive around for another couple hundred miles and see if the noise comes back.</p>

<p>Additionally, the mechanic mentioned that the drums could be the reason behind the uneven wear on my front pads. He also mentioned that the groove on my front rotor, although far from desired, is unlikely to be the cause of the problem.</p>

<p>Let's see what happens this week!</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Story</h2>

<p>I have a 2012 Honda Civic LX. It's my first car, and I must say I drive it rather hard. After about 20k miles, my brakes started to feel wavy - I would hold the brake pedal, and the car would slow down in an inconsistent, wavy manner.</p>

<p>I figured that my rotors were warped (or, according to <a href=""http://www.stoptech.com/technical-support/technical-white-papers/-warped-brake-disc-and-other-myths"" rel=""noreferrer"">StopTech</a>, pad material was transferred unevenly), and I wanted to learn more about my car's brakes, so I decided to replace my rotors and pads.</p>

<p>I bought new EBC rotors (OEM replacements) and pads (Ultimax2, OEM replacements), and I replaced the originals. I made sure I installed the EBC parts exactly the way the OEM parts were installed, and I was sure to check the brake fluid level and re-grease the caliper pins and pad brackets.</p>

<p>After I installed the EBC parts, the brakes felt orgasmic. With that said, I tried my best to avoid using them too roughly in order to follow EBC's break-in procedure (see <a href=""http://ebcbrakes.com/about-ebc/faqs"" rel=""noreferrer"">EBC's FAQ</a>, item #9). I followed the break-in procedure for about 500 miles or so before I slowly transitioned back into my previous driving style. Still, the brakes felt great.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>After a few months, my brakes started to emit a terrible grinding/groaning noise when I braked <em>sometimes</em>. This part is important - my brakes do not create the noise consistently - only <em>sometimes</em>. When I don't hear (or feel) the noise, my brakes seem as amazing as they were after I installed them.</p>

<h2>The Details</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>I was able to capture a recording of the sound after driving around for about 2 hours one night. I've uploaded the sound <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/nullsquared/brakes-groaning-and-grinding"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Make sure you turn up your speakers so that you can hear it well. Every time you hear the noise, I was coming to a slow stop.</p></li>
<li><p>The noise does not appear at high speed stops or during throttle braking. It only appears at low speed stops.</p>

<p>With that said, it still only happens <em>sometimes</em> during low speed stops - other times, I'm able to come to a low speed stop with perfectly smooth, silent brakes.</p></li>
<li><p>The noise has never happened after a cold start (i.e. when I drive to work in the morning).</p>

<p>The noise seems to only happen after I drive around for a while. It seems to happen more often after I drive around for a while, then stop the car for a little bit. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cold start</li>
<li>Drive to XYZ</li>
<li>Park for 15-30 mins</li>
<li>Drive away</li>
</ul>

<p>There's a good chance that the noise will occur during step 4, but no guarantee.</p>

<p>With that said, the noise does occur sometimes after driving around for a while without stopping at all.</p></li>
<li><p>The noise can come and go. For example, I could drive around for a while, start hearing the noise, then the noise might go away, and then it might start happening a couple of stops later.</p>

<p>This rules out surface rust, which would go away after the first couple of times of braking.</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes, especially after the noise happens or before it's about to happen, I can hear a faint screeching/squeeling sound when I brake. I can only hear it when I roll my window down and practically stick my head out the window. This sound is very, very different from the grinding/groaning noise.</p></li>
<li><p>I do not notice any loss of performance in the brakes, even while the noise is occurring. The car slows down correctly.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>The Investigation</h2>

<p>The other weekend, I took apart my brakes to see if I could pinpoint any obvious problems. I also cleaned and re-greased all of the appropriate parts, although that did not help. Here are my observations when I took apart the brakes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The pads are worn unevenly. The tops of the pads are visibly thinner than the bottoms of the pads.</p></li>
<li><p>The outer side of my driver's side rotor has an apparent groove on it:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/64UUL.jpg"" alt=""Rotor groove""></p>

<p>The corresponding brake pad has a matching groove:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IsAqv.jpg"" alt=""Pad groove""></p>

<p>However, if this groove was the cause of the noise, wouldn't the noise happen every time I brake?</p></li>
<li><p>I tried to bed in the pads using the 60-10 x5 procedure (slow down from 60 MPH to 10 MPH several times with short cooling periods in between, also described on EBC's FAQ).</p>

<p>This did not help - the noise happened again the next day.</p>

<p>With that said, I'm not entirely sure if I performed the procedure correctly - perhaps I did not slow down quickly enough.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>The Question</h2>

<p>What's causing this terrible grinding/groaning noise when I use the brakes <em>sometimes</em>?</p>
","<p>Well, the new rotors and pads were the answer. I'm surprised that the EBC OEM replacements gave me so much trouble, but the new EBC Red Stuff (ceramic) pads and slotted rotors have been wonderful. Even with my typical hard braking, no noise, and better performance, too.</p>

The AirCon can switch itself on and off intermitantly when you have a faulty resistor pack/thermostat, faulty track on your Accelerator position switch, faulty Hot-Cold control, faulty system pressure switches, compressor clutch, or associated relays and wiring. The way to go is an AirCon system scan to isolate the electrical fault(s).</p>

"What is the cold engine light really telling me?","95298","","<p>My 2013 Honda Fit has been for the past few weeks or so invariably showing me the cold engine light (a blue thermometer with the letter C) when I start it up before or after work (or most other times). I looked in the manual to see what exactly this means, but all it says is something like ""the engine is cold"" without any more information as to what I should do about it. It turns itself off after a couple minutes of driving.</p>

<p>I presume this information is relevant to <em>something,</em> or else they wouldn't have bothered to make a light for it, but I haven't been able to figure out what.</p>
","<p>Engines run safely and effectively in a temperature range which is actually fairly narrow. The temperature gauge (or cold and hot indicator lights) typically measure the temperature of the engine coolant itself.</p>

<p>When the car is first started, the engine is cold, and oil will need time to heat up and achieve good flow for lubrication. Until that temperature is reached, the engine is more susceptible to damage at high revs or under load.</p>

<p>Guidance is to drive relatively gently until the low temp light goes out. In a highly tuned car, with tighter tolerances, this is even more important. So treat it as a gentle warning. </p>

<p>If it comes on again while driving, this usually means there is a major problem with your coolant - typically that it has leaked out of the engine entirely so the sensor doesn't read anything! What happens next is that the engine rapidly overheats, destroying the cylinder head gasket, and soon after - the engine itself!</p>

"Will higher octane fuel improve gas mileage?","93257","","<p>I've heard from some people that high octane fuel will increase gas mileage. Around here, we have the basic unleaded(87), mid-grade(89), and premium(93 or 91). I've been using the basic 87 unleaded forever because it was the cheapest. Also, in my car's manual it recommend the lowest grade to use is 87(Grand Am 2004 V6) </p>

<p>On a car with no modifications will high octane fuel in general improve gas mileage, decrease it, or have no effect? </p>
","<p>Use the recommended gas for your car.  Going lower than the recommended may reduce fuel economy as the engine may have to retard timing to avoid detonation.  Going higher than recommended won't help as your engine is unable to take full advantage of it, as well as the fact that higher octane fuels actually contain slightly less energy (they just offer a more controlled burn that higher compression engines can take advantage of).</p>

"Blocked water flow in engine?","93029","","<p>My dad has a 1993 Subaru Legacy L 2.2L (no turbo) with a perplexing cooling problem. It overheats, and there doesn't appear to be flow through the cooling system.</p>

<p>The upper radiator hose is extremely hot, the lower radiator hose is cold. </p>

<p>The thermostat has been replaced 3 times now. They have all been put in boiling water, and they all opened. </p>

<p>The car has been parked on an inclined and filled with coolant, been jacked up and filled, we've used the cap to vent, we've used the bleeder to vent. </p>

<p>For a while, he ran without a thermostat, but the seals in the water pump failed.</p>

<p>I just got home from replacing the water pump. The car still overheats. Again, upper hose hot, lower cold. The radiator is <em>cold</em> by the lower hose, then warm in an arc around the cold section, then hot along the top and on the entire passenger half of the radiator. Radiator fluid overflowed the overflow. </p>

<p>I'm at a loss; it seems like there's a no flow condition, but a garden hose in one end of the radiator got water flowing out the other end and the thermostat(s) have all been tested. Is it possible to have coolant flow through the engine blocked? </p>

<p>:EDIT:</p>

<ol>
<li>I would love it if it were the radiator as it's extremely easy to swap out, but a garden hose on one end passed (clear) water through without backing up on the inlet side. I would think that <em>any</em> flow through the radiator would get the whole thing at least warm and definitely warm up the lower radiator hose. Is there another test we can do to check it? </li>
<li>This will sound crazy, but neither radiator fan works. HOWEVER, as there is no flow through the radiator (lower radiator hose and bottom driver's quarter of the radiator are COLD), my first concern is getting flow through the radiator and then I'll worry about the radiator fans. </li>
<li>Everything worked fine with no thermostat (and no radiator fans), but the seal failed in the water pump after maybe 5-10k miles. The car was purchased used and had cooling issues from the start. The garage that sold the car replaced the water pump after the sale, then when that didn't fix anything they said the radiator was clogged and flushed it. Things got a little better, but the car still overheated. This was when the first two thermostats were installed. Eventually Dad removed the thermostat entirely and the car ran fine until the water pump seal failed. When I replaced it yesterday I suggested we install the thermostat, et voila, heat issues return. There is a bypass line before the thermostat, but I don't remember looking at a coolant schematic so I couldn't say where that line goes for sure. </li>
</ol>

<p>:EDIT 2:</p>

<p>The car overheated on 3 mile test drive and didn't cool off at all despite coasting the second half of that drive at 35mph with a manual transmission. </p>

<p>:EDIT 3:</p>

<p>There is no heat from the car with the heater on and the fan at full speed, but there is also very little air flow from the vents. The no heat situation persists regardless of engine temperature; what little air there is feels the same with the engine cold or fully overheated. </p>
","<p>If this was in my bay I would proceed as follows:</p>

<p>Repair fans: It will overheat at idle without the fans. The first test for this is to turn on the A/C, both, one or none will come on.  Test and repair as needed.</p>

<p>Test for system flow: Remove the inlet hose to the heater at the firewall. Test pressure and flow rate. A lot of water should be pushed out when the engine is revved. The pump should make at least 10 psi. This gives the relative heath of the water pump.  The most common cause of poor flow in a Subaru is air trapped in the engine block.</p>

<p>I would flow test the radiator and visually inspect the radiator interior.  The flow tests is not very helpful.  A radiator can flow great but not transfer heat if it is fouled with coolant scale deposits. </p>

<p>From your description I would repair fans first, replace the radiator, put it all back together. Test after repairs by timing the fan run time. If the fans are off most to the time and the fans run only about 20% of the time and the fans blow warm air it is fixed. If the fans run most to the time and the air coming out is cold it is not fixed.</p>

"How long should I let me car warm up in the winter?","91807","","<p>I have been reading mixed reviews about how long to let your car warm up before driving in the winter months. Most of the articles say that the best way to warm it up is to let it idle for 1-2 minutes, then drive gently until it reaches its optimal temperature.</p>

<p>My concern is the following:</p>

<p>When I start the car in cold weather the tachometer usually sits around 1500 rpm - 1750 rpm. When it has been running for a while it idles at 750 RPM and the car runs much smoother when it's at this point. It takes almost 10 minutes of idle to get it warmed up to 750 rpm (in about -10* weather).</p>

<p>Is it smart to idle and wait for it to get to it's regular RPM before driving off?<br>
Will driving off before it gets to a low RPM be harmful to the car in the long run? </p>
","<p>I would agreee with the articles - waiting a minute or so (generally the time it takes to clear the ice off the windows...) is generally fine. </p>

<p>As the other answers say, the engine will idle high to start with, as the ECU compensates for the colder block and thicker oil by running the engine richer. This will cause more wear to the engine, as the oil is thicker and so won't lubricate as well as normal, but it will do so whether you are stationary or moving, so you might as well be moving. The key thing is to make sure the engine gets a chance to warm up properly over the course of the journey - lots of short journeys in cold weather will be bad for the engine as the wear will be proportionally higher.</p>

"What can cause a vehicle to run hot, but not overheat?","91312","","<p>Anyway, I have a Grand Am 2003 V6. It only has 80k miles. My car ran great when I got it(used), but at some point it began to have minor temperature problems. It would always run a little bit hotter than it should. This basically just meant I couldn't keep it idling forever. At some point I took a drive for about an hour and the vehicle was running fine. I got to where I needed. On my way back home though it overheated. It didn't blow up or anything because I caught it in time, but it hit the redline. I checked it and it had no coolant at all. I let it cool off and filled it up with water and there weren't any leaks and it drove fine after that except for the before mentioned idle-overheating problem. This was about 2 years ago.</p>

<p>I ran over a deer a few months ago though and now the problems are worse. It was discovered that one of my fans was burned up, so that could have been the previous problem. Now though, the radiator has been replaced and both fans work and now it stays hotter than usual just driving. The temperature it usually should be at is about 200F. It now commonly stays about 205 and can get as high as 225 with just normal driving(note, 260F is red line)</p>

<p>One more unique thing about this. If my engine is at about 205 when I park, if I turn off my car and leave it for about 15 minutes, when I come back and start it, it will usually be about 215 or so. Basically, noticeably hotter after turning it off and back on. </p>

<p>I've checked for leaks -- There may be a very small leak somewhere. But it shouldn't be anything to worry about because I fill it up with about 2 cups of coolant or so after 3 or 4 months. So it's a small leak, if not just evaporation. And of course, I've checked to make sure I have enough coolant and that it's mixed properly.</p>

<p>And the only other thing(which is getting fixed soon) is that my air conditioner lines are ran wrong with one of the lines right against a heat shield on the engine, but that shouldn't affect the temp of the car should it?</p>

<p>So what could be the problem? I don't expect to fix this myself, but I'd love to be able to suggest to a mechanic maybe what the problem is instead of them tinkering around for a couple of very expensive hours.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I don't know how I forgot to mention this, but there is a hissing coming from my engine. I thought it was from my A/C(which is normal?), but I'm beginning to think it's not. Basically, I can hear a hissing that appears to be coming from within the air vents in the interior. The hissing is particularly loud when idle or braking and goes away completely while doing hard acceleration with it getting more and more quiet with the harder I press the accelerator. </p>
","<p>This actually ended up being a very simple problem. Something so simple that I'm almost in disbelief. </p>

<p>My car has been running nearly straight antifreeze.(I'd say about 90% anyway) Everyone I'd talked to locally has said it should run <code>even cooler</code> doing that... but they're wrong. I emptied my expansion tank(not the radiator itself) and filled it with straight water. After a day of running it and letting it mix my car is now back to running at 200F and doesn't get hotter while idling or anything. </p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Just to finalize on this ancient question for future viewers.
Running straight antifreeze was definitely the biggest problem, but not the only one. I never did find the cause, and I sold the car around a year ago because of that and various other looming mechanical problems (ie, would always stall out on first start, etc). Things I did and their results:</p>

<ol>
<li>Actually use 50/50 water/antifreeze -- had a major result and kept the temps reasonable most of the time</li>
<li>Got cooling fans replaced -- was able to keep it cool enough that it survived a 16 hour road trip without too much worrying. If I idled a lot or was in stop/go traffic though it still got warmer than it should.. and a few times the fans would still randomly pop a fuse for some reason. I think the electrics was messed up in some way. Sometimes it'd be getting hotter and hotter, but then turning on the AC instantly cooled it down, indicating the AC fan was keeping the radiator cooler?</li>
<li>had radiator checked for blockages etc, had the thermometer thing (thing to controls when coolant valve is opened) replaced, etc.. nothing conclusive came of it</li>
</ol>

<p>Only thing I never had done was have the water pump replaced... so maybe that would've been something close to it.. Just before selling it, I had the timing belt ""tensioner"" or whatever it's called replaced, and I don't recall having any problems after that point with the cooling... but that could've just been coincidence..</p>

<p>So glad to have a new car now that I don't have to worry about breaking down or overheating every time I drive it</p>

"Changed my brake pads but brakes started smoking due to a stuck caliper (99 Honda Accord)","90418","","<p>Long story short, I was doing a simple DIY brake pad change and it seems that the brake caliper got stuck (the the brake line seem to be slightly twisted).  I went for a test drive in the neighbor and unfortunately, the front driver side brakes started smoking and the rotors actually turned red from the immense heat.  </p>

<p>I know I messed up and made a noobie and stupid mistake on my part but I'm wondering what else I could've messed up.  I'm guessing since the brakes were smoking and the rotors were red (with heat), the rotors are warped.  I'm hoping thats the extent of the damage but I'm wondering what else could be affected?</p>

<p>To make it short</p>

<p>1) stuck brake caliper, most likely due to bent brake line
2) test drove and braked at 35mph and front driver side brake started smoking, turning bright red and loud noise
3) I tried to take off the caliper but it seemed stuck</p>

<p>Questions</p>

<p>1) Outside of brake pad and rotor, what else could be damaged due to a stuck brake caliper?
2) If the caliper is stuck due to a twisted brake line, can I just bleed it to uncompress the brake caliper?</p>

<p>thanks for any answers and to save you guys time, yes...I messed up and made stupid mistakes but I will learn from this.</p>
","<p>The caliper should be fine once the brake line issue is repaired providing it didn't get hot enough to melt the seals. The pads may appear fine but I would replace them. Pads that got that hot mays have hairline cracks in them. The cracks could eventually cause pieces of the lining to flake off. The rotor is likely in need of replacement also. As far as potential collateral damage the only thing that may be an issue is the front wheel bearing. At the worst you may have taken a few thousand miles off it's life expectancy. I wouldn't worry about it until you start having problems. </p>

"How long can I drive on a donut spare?","90061","","<p>This is a pretty common question and I get a lot of conflicting responses from ""Extremely dangerous could blow out at any minute"" to ""I've driven on it for a month"". A mechanic at midas told me I could drive on it for a week and be fine.</p>

<p>I'm driving a 1993 Grand Am thats actually in fairly good condition.

<p>So in this scenario, is it safe to drive on the donut until the weekend to have it replaced or should take time off in the morning to have it fixed? </p>

<p>This isn't a general question but more so a ""In this exact scenario"".</p>
","<p>First, the critical caveat: </p>

<p><strong>You are the driver.  You have to make the decision.</strong>  It ultimately doesn't matter what we say.</p>

<p>Given, that, I would say <strong>NO</strong>, it is not safe to drive until the weekend.  Get the broken tire fixed or replaced as soon as possible.</p>

<p>You have two problems:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Top speed limitation: the donut is top-speed rated for 50 mph (check the sidewall of the donut).  That's a hard limit.  I would expect failure probabilities to increase rapidly as speed increased.  Stories about how someone drove super fast on a donut I regard as the babblings of a lunatic.</p></li>
<li><p>Maximum distance: driving until the weekend is three calendar days as of today (Wednesday).  At your cited distance, that's at least 72 miles.  Check the sidewall of the donut: there's almost certainly a maximum distance cited and it's usually 50 miles <em>(edited: Brian is right in the comments.  70 is less common)</em>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Absolute best case: you'd drive super slowly and go the full 72 miles.  At that point, you'd need to get your broken tire fixed <em>and</em> you'd need to purchase a new donut.</p>

<p>Worst case, you try to drive on icy roads on a donut and have a terrible accident.  Please don't.</p>

"Why check oil when engine is at operating temperature?","90006","","<p>The owner's manual to my VW Golf Mk7 states</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>With the engine at operating temperature</strong>, park the vehicle on a level surface to ensure that the engine oil reading is correct.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why is it important for the engine to be at operating temperature when checking oil level?</p>
","<p><strong>tl;dr: This procedure checks the oil ""reserve"" remaining in the pan after all moving parts are lubricated.</strong></p>

<p>This procedure is purely vehicle dependent.  For example, on my car, I'm supposed to check the oil when the engine is cold.</p>

<p>In asking you to check when the engine is hot, the oil will not be pooled in the oil pan.  Instead, it will have been fully circulated to all the moving parts that badly need that oil to function.  As a result, you'll be checking the oil reserve that remains in the pan.</p>

<p>Note, this oil isn't extra.  Among its many functions, oil is also carrying some of the heat load of the engine.  All those hot moving parts get the oil in contact up to painful temperatures.  An ""excess"" allows the oil to absorb more heat without burning completely away.  The oil in my car leaves the block, passes through an oil cooler and then to the oil pan before circulating back into the fray.</p>

<p><em>Note: I can also check the oil in my car when hot by using different marks on the dipstick.  I prefer the cold procedure so I can confirm total oil.</em></p>

<p>Normally the transmission will not let me shift gears without using the clutch.  However, if I hit the right RPM, my stick will let me shift into the new gear without any resistance.  Why does this work and is there a downside?</p>
","<p>You can do this if your engine RPM, the speed of the vehicle, and the gear you are shifting to/from is just right. The reason you can do this is because you have <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_transmission#Synchromesh"">synchros</a> in the transmission which allows the two gears to match rotational speeds as they come in contact (basically, there is more to it than this, but hopefully you get the drift). The synchros are sacrificial in that as they are designed to wear out before the gears get worn. When you perform clutchless shifting, you are creating a large amount of unneeded wear on your synchros. By wearing these out, you'll be required to rebuild your transmission sooner than by utilizing normal shifting methods. With the clutchless method you are using, you are causing these the synchros to attempt to mesh until the correct rpm is met, even if it is for a short period of time. This is where the wear will occur. Even if it is a short period of time, there is just about no way you can hit this exact <em>every time</em>. If you feel that you are, you are more than likely fooling yourself. <em>Any resistance</em> during the shift is unneeded wear on the synchros.</p>

<li>City climate: mild (winter -5°C (23°F), summer: 29°C (84°F))</li>
</ul>

<p><sup>          1) note: bi-fuel came from manufacturer (no modifications); CNG fuel is different from LPG</sup></p>
","<p>As a general rule of checking, three things; the battery, anything that is rubber (serpentine belt, tyres) and the fluids (oils, coolant).  </p>

<p><strong>Battery</strong>: Even if you disconnect the battery, it cannot retain all the juice inside forever and it will drain eventually. This will reduce its life.</p>

<p><strong>Engine</strong>: Your various belts and wires can get corroded if not used over a long period; the serpentine belt can get corroded, some animal can chew up the wire or do damage when it's resting.</p>

<p>Your valves and cylinder walls might get corroded due to lack of any oil or movement inside.</p>

<p><strong>Brakes</strong>: This happened to me personally where they lose their grip over time.</p>

<p>The above things can go bad, additionally your wheels can get jammed if not used for months, and if you are near a coastal area, your can can be prone to faster corrosion.</p>

<p><strong>Electrical</strong>: Sometimes the interior electricals tend to develop a fault such as the power windows get jammed, electric seats. </p>

<p><strong>AC Gas leak:</strong> Cars that are not used over a long time might cause ineffective cooling from the Air Conditioner and will need to be recharged.</p>

<p><strong>Fluids</strong>: Most of the fluids, like engine oil/brake fluid, break down, they lose their ability to lubricate eventually though this takes much much longer like half a year or so; but still you will need to replace them.</p>

<p>Since yours is a CNG vehicle, check if the hoses are fine and have not developed a leakage. I would also advise to use petrol if it's going to be intermittent usage since the gas does not lubricate the engine component such as valves as much as petrol; this will not cause any serious harm but it's better to use petrol for a few miles initially and then switch to LPG.</p>

<p>I'm getting around 22 MPG when I should be getting around 35... the 2JZ which is the most fuel-hungry version has 20-25 (in cars with similar mileage), I got the car like 6 months ago and is always been like that, the previous owner and the mechanics I took it to said the engine hasn't been mod (and knowing a bit on the subject as well, I think so too). The Altezza is produced for the Japanese Market (with high standards though) so all the average consumption I've inferred on how much all the other stock cars in my team consume.</p>
","<p>Apparently there's one more thing you can check to see if you're engine is consuming too much, and that is the composition of the exhaust gas. I took my engine to a dyno before swapping it for a 2JZ ('cuz hey, if I'm gonna the 2JZ mileage anyways, might as well get power) and they told me the engine was getting more fuel than it should.</p>

<p>Apparently the engine fuel intake regulator wasn't regulating properly but still ""working"" so no engine issue was detected.</p>

<p>I would still recommend to go through the steps in the original question, and if that all fails then take it to the dyno and measure the air/fuel ratio through the exhaust gasses.</p>

"What brake components need to be lubricated?","82772","","<p>When doing a DIY brake job, I understand that it's necessary lubricate several components of the pad/caliper assembly. From various sources, I have been told that the following are the places where brake grease should be applied:</p>

<ol>
<li>The slide pins connecting one side of the caliper to the other (generously).</li>
<li>The hook-shaped bits on either side of the pad which sit on the caliper.</li>
<li>The metal back of the pad which contacts the hydraulic piston (lightly).</li>
<li>The edges of the hydraulic piston.</li>
</ol>

<p>I've also seen people recommending using anti-sieze lubricant in-between the end of the axle and the rotor, so it's easier to remove the next time the brakes need to be done.</p>

<p>My question is, have I missed any important areas that need lubrication? Or included some that really shouldn't be lubricated? Also, I have heard some people say that anti-sieze should be preferred instead of brake grease - is this true?</p>
","<p>Personally, I'm not the hugest fan of anti-seize. I feel like you use it once and it follows you around for the next month. You end up finding it in your sock drawer for heaven's sake. I use similar lube except it's a gold color. It seems to be do lot less following me around, and applies in a much cleaner fashion.</p>

<h2>Brake Lubrication</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Lube all contact surfaces between caliper, mount, and pads including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Back side of brake pads
<ul>
<li>Don't forget any shims that are present between the pad and the piston.</li>
<li>If the pads have aluminum clips that ""snap"" them into the piston then make sure to lube these.</li>
<li>Style points count on this: don't slop it all over the place. I usually explain ""too little"" as: ""If you're trying to be Picasso, you're not using enough"".</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Put a light layer of lube between the large center opening of the rotor and the hub, and on the rotor hold-down screw, if the vehicle has one.
<ul>
<li>This helps keep the metals from bonding/rusting together and requiring extensive force (some real swings of a hammer) for removal the next time it's needed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If the caliper is equipped with slide pins, then pull them out of the caliper housing, clean them off, apply your lube, and put them back in.
<ul>
<li>Once you have the pins reinstalled, work them back and forth a few times to make sure that the lube is spread properly and there is no binding.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If there are metal slides that sit between the caliper and mount, lube (lightly) between the slide and the mount, and also between the caliper mount and where it contacts the brake pad ears.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><hr>
For me, it was easier to just explain how I lube brakes and their components. You seemed to have touched most of the same points as I did. If you end up lubing the area between the hub and rotor, just make sure not to get any anti-seize on the threads of the lug bolts/studs. I hope this helps reassure you about your procedure.</p>

"Air conditioner is hot on one side","82695","","<p>My 2005 Chevy Silverado with dual zone climate is occasionally blowing hot air on the driver's side and cool on the passenger. It usually works fine for a few minutes before it begins blowing hot air. Once it starts blowing heat, it seems to continue until I park for a while. It doesn't always have this problem.</p>

<p>I'm guessing it's a vacuum or electric problem. I assume that low refrigerant would cause both sides be hot.</p>

When I had this problem in my Avalanche, I found that turning the temperature all the way to the 90 degree max setting (when set to equal cooling for both sides), waiting a few seconds for the door to stop moving, and then turning the temp back down, would resolve the issue temporarily.</p>

"Cooling fans not running","82667","","<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>This question seems to be attracting a lot of views, so I guess a lot of people are having the same problem.</p>

<p>Just to be clear, the problem with MY fans specifically seemed to be caused by my new temp sensor being faulty. <em>This isn't likely to be your problem</em>, but don't rule it out. There are some other great diagnostics suggested below for other possible reasons the fans aren't running.</p>

<p>There was a bigger problem with overheating with this car, even after the fans were running correctly. The stock engine comes with a plastic intake manifold gasket, which is prone to failure. It leaks coolant into the cylinders and causes inefficiency in the cooling system, leading to low coolant and overheating. You can replace this gasket with a metal one, the repair is a little involved but I managed with a Haynes manual. Good luck!</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Original Question</strong></p>

<p>My 2000 Pontiac Grand Am GT (6 cy/3.4L) has been having cooling issues. I started by replacing the thermostat and performing a flush &amp; fill on the radiator. This didn't seem to resolve the issue -- the engine still overheats when at a stop.</p>

<p>This lead me to suspect the fans, so I tested the fans themselves (independent dual electric cooling fans). They do not start when the engine is warm... this is the problem.</p>

<p>I wired each fan directly to the battery, both function correctly. Next, I checked the relays, both tested operational. If I disconnect the temperature sensor, both fans come on immediately. So, I replaced the temperature sensor.</p>

<p>The problem persists; the engine will reach 200, the thermostat opens (determined by watching the temp. gauge), but the fans do not start. If I disconnect the (new!) temperature sensor, both fans start. I have read that turning the air conditioning on should also cause the fans to turn on, this does not happen (with the temp. sensor plugged in), not when then engine is cool or hot.</p>

<p>I am at my wits end as to what to check next. I am prepared instead to hardwire the fans to the ignition switch. <strong>Can anyone give me any ideas of any further diagnostic steps before I give up and take the ""duct tape solution""?</strong> This is my wife's daily driver, so the pressure is on! Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>I read online others having this issue as well.  One site turned up this information regarding a ""service bulletin"":</p>

NEW IMMOBILIZER SYSTEM ON '06 CIVICS.
</code></pre>

<p>Which provides me with no information at all.  Some sites mentioned disconnecting the battery cables and reconnecting after 20 minutes to cause a reset.</p>

<p>I have a unique situation to add to this problem everyone else is having.  I have aftermarket Viper Smart Start (remote start) and I am able to start my car fine with the remote start, put my key in and drive off.</p>

<p>Leads me to believe it is this ""immobilizer system"" is the issue as the remote start should be bypassing it.</p>

<p>Ive had my car for 7 years and this problem just started happening in the last 3 months. </p>

<p>I do not know if this is related but here is more info:
This is before the key light issue.  I had the car parked for winter.  Came back in spring and battery was dead, had to jump it and charge it.  I charge the battery and car starts fine all day, then the next day the car wont start - have to jump again.  This was repeating daily.</p>

<p>Aftermarket stuff:  stereo deck + amp + speakers, backup sensors, second dry cell battery in the trunk, and one of those $70 devices that is suppose to keep your primary batter from dying because you left your stereo on too long - dont remember what its called.</p>

<p>Im not really sure where to start, honda dealership, stereo shop?  The battery is only 1 year old and they told me they wont replace it because they think the stereo caused a drain to the battery and I need to fix it first.</p>
","<p>I have a 2006 Honda Civic EX and experienced the same issue under similar circumstances and have since solved the issue:</p>

<p>1) Cold weather 2) Car was recently jump started 3) Receiving flashing green key indicator 4) Car starts then shuts off  5) Battery problems</p>

<p>I went outside one cold winter morning and the car was dead.  Click click click.  A friend of mine came by to try giving the car a jump, which allowed me to get the car to start, I could even rev the engine once or twice, but then, like something told it to, the car would die, all the while flashing a green key on on the dash display (This green key is in fact the indicator for the cars immobilizer system.  When you start the car with the key that matches your car, the green key will flash solid once, and the car will start fine.  If the key does not match your car, the green key will flash multiple times, at which point the car will die).</p>

<p>I continued to reproduce the same results previously described, but eventually the battery would no longer recharge from just the power of my friends small sedan.  </p>

<p>Ultimately, after being towed to my regular mechanic, and then the dealer, the stated problem was that one of the cells in the battery had gone bad, and I just needed a new one.  Looking closer at the bill from the dealer, they did in fact have to first reprogram my key to the cars computer.  The issue started with the immobilizer.  Apparently at some point, one of the two was scrambled, and my car was no longer accepting the key.  After a number of tries to jump the car in cold weather, with a bad battery, the immobilizer issue no longer mattered, because the car's battery no longer had enough juice left to allow for anything but some clicking, let alone starting and activating the immobilizer.  </p>

<p>Short story long, I did a little digging and what seems to cause the key and the car to no longer communicate properly (which activates the immobilizer) is jump starting the car with the key in the ignition.  This should be a no brainer to begin with, but it happens, obviously.  <strong>Don't have your keys in the ignition when jump starting your car.</strong>  It is possible that the key can be in the first of the three ignition positions without causing the problem, but I'm not going to try and find out. </p>

<p>Fortunately, the dealer (and some competent honda mechanics) can quickly reprogram your key to the cars immobilizer unit (literally found right under the ignition).  Unfortunately, the issue is typically paired with a battery problem, and if you can't get the car to start, it needs to be towed in order to be reprogrammed.  </p>

<p><strong>If you're experiencing this problem:</strong></p>

<p>1)  Bypass your regular mechanic and have the car towed to a Honda dealer.  Your car's immobilizer needs to be reprogrammed.  Tell them the circumstances leading up to the problem, including anything involving recently jump starting the vehicle, the green flashing key light, etc.</p>

<p>2)  Inform them of Technical Service Bulletin (TSB) 09012005</p>

<p>Make : HONDA Model : CIVIC Year : 2006
Manufacturer : HONDA (AMERICAN HONDA MOTOR CO.)

<p>3)  Make it clear you want the immobilizer checked first.  Don't let them tell you you need to buy a new key.</p>

<p>4)  Even with all of the information out there, this seems to be a puzzle to some dealers, so don't be afraid to call every day to check on the status (most likely, they will be calling you first).  If days have gone by, and they have not tried reprogramming the immobilizer unit, something is fishy, and it is time to insist.</p>

<p>5)  Wait for the phone call back from the dealer telling you either it was simply the immobilizer issue, or that you need a new battery.  In the latter case, don't expect to necessarily hear/see anything about the immobilizer issue until you get the bill.  </p>

<p>6)  When you get the car back, and you start it for the first time, your radio will ask you to enter a code before it will allow any audio to be played.  If you have lost the card that has this code on it that should have come with the car in the first place, check for a white sticker on the body of the glove box, normally outer left side.  It will most likely be a 5 digit number next to a longer serial number.  Use the displays buttons to enter the code.  If you can't find this sticker, head to the Honda Navicode Website to retrieve it: <a href=""https://radio-navicode.honda.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://radio-navicode.honda.com/</a>.</p>

<p>7)  If, like the original poster, you have had a remote starter installed in your vehicle, the mechanic who installed it would have had to put an ""immobilizer bypass"" unit in the car, in order for the remote starter to work.  As these bypass units are doing just that, bypassing the immobilizer, they are typically not the issue in this circumstance.  In fact, the car can often be started with the remote start and not the key, specifically because the remote starter bypasses the immobilizer all-together.  Either way, be sure to let whomever is working on the car know about the remote starter, just to be safe.</p>

"Does giving gas while releasing the clutch cause unnecessary wear?","79544","","<p>I drive a 2013 Ford Fusion SE with manual transmission. I learned to drive a manual as a kid but picked up a lot of bad habits. In particular I tend to naturally ride the clutch. Now, of course in 1st or Reverse you have to let the clutch slip a little, but I'm having difficulty not letting any slipping from 1st to 2nd.</p>

<p><strong>When shifting from 1st to 2nd, will I wear out my clutch or transmission by giving the car some gas as you release the clutch?</strong></p>

<p>My feeling is that the answer should be no, I just need to practice and do: ""clutch. switch gear. release clutch. gas."" but at the appropriate engine speed.</p>

<p>I'm confused because many people on various fora say that it's ok to give gas while you're releasing the clutch, but I'm skeptical because this seems like it would wear on the clutch. I obviously do not want to wear out my car.</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Is it ok to give gas while releasing the clutch?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, but your goal is to give exactly the right amount of gas.</p>

<p>The thing to remember is that the clutch is a consumable part (it's really a whole system of parts that can be consumed but let's pretend that it's a single unique piece for the sake of discussion).  As such, it has a finite supply of work that it can do over its service life, useful or otherwise.  To clarify, this is what it <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_transmission#Clutch"">means to slip the clutch</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Between these extremes of engagement and disengagement the clutch
  slips to varying degrees. When slipping it still transmits torque
  despite the difference in speeds between the engine crankshaft and the
  transmission input. Because this torque is transmitted by means of
  friction rather than direct mechanical contact, considerable power is
  wasted as heat (which is dissipated by the clutch). Properly applied,
  slip allows the vehicle to be started from a standstill, and when it
  is already moving, allows the engine rotation to gradually adjust to a
  newly selected gear ratio.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As noted, the clutch is a friction-based part (rather than a direct gear).  The above quote means that your goal as the driver is to attempt to ensure that the clutch is spending more time in a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction#Static_friction"">static friction</a> mode (i.e., where the frictional surfaces of the clutch are turning at the same speed, pressed tightly together) rather than a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction#Kinetic_friction"">kinetic friction</a> mode (i.e., where the frictional surfaces are turning at different speeds and are slipping past each other).</p>

<p>This means that the answer to your original question is that it is ok to give <em>exactly the right amount</em> of gas when releasing the clutch pedal.  Any more or less than the optimal amount will lead to some slippage of the clutch.  Some slippage is to be expected, with wear increasing super-linearly as the difference between target and actual revs increases.  </p>

<p>The better you are at rev matching, the longer your clutch will last (and the more comfortable your passengers will be).</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr: You have to slip the clutch from a stop.  In higher gears, your goal is to avoid slipping the clutch.  You do this by matching engine speed to transmission speed before releasing the clutch pedal.</strong></p>

"How far can I drive with 1 gallon too much oil?","79096","","<p>I have way too much oil in my Acura TSX.  Do I need to take care of it without turning it on or can I drive it to a service station?  </p>

<p>If I need to do it in place, I don't have the ramps or a pan or the daylight left and my wife needs the car in the morning.   Can I siphon the oil out of the top?  If so, what type of tubing won't be dissolved by the oil?</p>

<p>========</p>

<p>If you want to laugh, yes I'm an idiot.  The car's been great for years and years and I've never been good about checking the oil.  Just regular oil changes and there's been no problem.</p>

<p>The second to last oil change, they sold me on synthetic and said I'd be good for a year.  Well, after a year and many miles, turned out the engine was almost dry!  Apparently ""one year"" was a bad recommendation.  No damage done, but close.</p>

<p>Anyway, now I've been anxious about running out of oil, so I checked it an saw very little oil on the dipstick.  Since it's been so long, I'd forgotten what to expect - ""that's a long piece of metal with nothing on it"", I think.  So I get a big jug, enough for a full oil change, and empty into my engine.  Only once the oil level doesn't rise nearly as far as I expected do I realize I made a mistake.  My only excuse is that the dipstick level indicators are very subtle on the TSX, just two holes.  I was looking at the big bends (what are they for anyway?).</p>
","<p>You haven't wrecked the car but you should get the oil down to the appropriate level.  </p>

<p>If the oil isn't hot, almost any sort of plastic tubing can be used for siphoning.  It's easiest to go in via the dip stick.</p>

<p>Remember not to use the ""suck start"" siphoning method as you don't want a mouthful of oil.  If you have a long enough piece of tubing, you can stick the excess down the dipstick tube, put your thumb over the end, pull out the slack (that is now full of oil) and you'll have an immediate siphon.</p>

<p>Also remember to siphon the oil back into the original container - you might as well keep it until you do need it.</p>

<p>My vote is that you take care of it yourself - I hate letting other people know that I made a goof, especially if I can fix it myself.</p>

I couldn't agree with him, as I couldn't find any issues with this. Also I couldn't find any information regarding the same on the manual for Toyota Corolla.</p>

<p>Do you guys have any technical details about this? <br>
Thank you in Advance.</p>
","<p>Being in <strong>Neutral</strong> or <strong>Drive</strong> should have negligible to no effect on the distance the vehicle travels when the accelerator is not pressed because the torque converter disengages the engine below predetermined RPM levels.</p>

<p>However, if you somehow were to push just a little too hard and sent the transmission into <strong>Reverse</strong> instead of stopping in <strong>Neutral</strong>, you would most likely be faced with purchasing a new transmission.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>Rafi: If, by your question, you mean to say that you put the transmission into <strong>Neutral</strong> while waiting at a stop light, then this would not harm the transmission in any way.</p>

<p>Though it will not harm your transmission to shift into <strong>Neutral</strong> while your vehicle is in motion, the additional wear on your brakes by leaving the transmission in <strong>Drive</strong> will be negligible over the life of the brake pads. It is that minor.</p>

","<p>I appears to be coming from the front and the center of the engine. I could be a hose near the water pump. The water pump itself may have failed. Most water pumps have a weep hole that drips when the seals fail. It is on the bottom of the pimp and difficult to see. You may be able to feel it by reaching under the pump, it is a small hole about half the diameter of a pencil. Finding the exact source is determined with a pressurized tester. It is a small hand pump that pressurizes the system and forces the coolant out at the leak point. You may be able to get a loaner from a big box auto parts store. It is used with a cold system and the engine off so you can reach in with your hand to find the drip. Filling the system with water for the test makes it cheaper and cleaner (no toxic,expensive antifreeze leaking on the ground). How ever if it is below freezing in your location water presents its own challenges. After the leak is found and the repair made the water must be drained and the system filled with a 50/50 mix of antifreeze.</p>

"Battery drains by itself when vehicle is parked (parasitic draw)","73746","","<p>A 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee has gone through 3 batteries in the last 3 months. While they have all been replaced by warranties, it'd be nice to get the problem solved permanently. I've tested the alternator, and it's not defective. I'm suspecting it might be a short somewhere in the system. How can I track down if this is a short, and if so, where the short is occuring?</p>
","<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimeter"">Standard digital multimeters</a> can measure current and help you identify what in your vehicle is consuming your battery's juice. Get an electrical diagram of your vehicle and try to narrow it down by doing current measurements in the various major paths of flow. When your car is off, no (or only trace) current should be flowing. Every time the path of electricity splits, you'll have to test each to determine which one is drawing the juice. There's no telling how many of these you'll have to check before you reach the problem.</p>

<p>This answer of course assumes the juice is being drained while the vehicle is off. I suppose it is possible that it is draining while on also.  Either the alternator is bad or it isn't able to produce enough juice to keep up with your vehicle's demand (which probably includes some defective component that is sucking lots of juice). If it keeps running normally, it might be worth checking the leads coming to the battery (while still disconnected) with a meter to ensure it is being fed properly by the alternator. </p>

"Unable to start the vehicle depending on how long it has previously been driven","73113","","<p>I have a Citroen C3 which is giving me a headache. The problem is a recent one, and is basically that I can't start the car. The strange thing is that the problem only surfaces when I've been driving the car, shut it down and then tried to start it again (for instance going to the supermarket). And the likeliness of this happening depends on for how long I've been driving the car.
I'm usually able to start the car, but the other day I had been driving for an hour before making a stop and after that the car didn't want to start for a few hours.</p>

<p>I'm relatively sure the problem isn't the battery since the headlights, windows, radio and dashboard all work. It's not the alternator since the car always starts after some period. The engine doesn't stutter, the car accelerates normally and fuel mileage is excellent so I doubt its the spark plugs. </p>

<p>Could it be the starter? Anyone ever had a similar problem and found a solution?</p>

<p><strong>Update #1</strong>:</p>

<p>I've gone to a mechanic and he took the starter out, tried it with a car battery and it worked but was a little weak. So he dismantled it, cleaned up a few parts, lubricated others, tested connectivity with a ohm meter and then tested it again with the battery. It ran much better.</p>

<p>He re-installed it in the car, and we tried turning the car on/off a few times and it worked like a charm. So I drove home, and immediately tried to turn the car back on when I had parked but it wouldn't start. I've since tried again to start and it worked so it seems the same problem (not starting after running for some time) exists but it isn't the starter.</p>

<p><strong>Update #2:</strong></p>

<p>I found this video (i.e not mine) where a person is explaining his starter problem with a Citroen C2, and the experience with when starting is exactly the same (loud clicking sound from engine compartment and all). Can be seen <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQSbCnhD83E"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update #3:</strong></p>

<p>This problem has now started to happen even when the car hasn't been driven for a long time (i.e in the mornings). This kind of rules out it being exclusively due to something heating up.</p>
","<p>If the engine doesn't turn when you turn the key, the problem is definitely either in the starter motor itself or delivery of electricity to the starter motor, so possibly the solenoid. Fixing the problem is probably going to involve replacing whichever part is going bad, but when you find yourself stuck, if your vehicle is a manual you might be able to turn the motor slightly by rolling with the car in gear to get it to a different position, then trying to start again.</p>

<p>One question that could help further diagnosis: do the interior lights dim when you turn the key, like they would during a successful start?</p>

","<p>Both previous posts are pretty good.  I'll add a few more considerations though.</p>

<p>According to my mechanic (20+ years of Volvo experience) the connector between the antenna ring and the wiring harness sometimes causes problems - taking it off, spraying it with contact cleaner, and re-seating it fixes these.  It could be that the vibrations from hitting the key were enough to overcome the resistance and allow the key to be recognized &amp; the car started.</p>

<p>It's a relatively simple job to get to and clean the connector, which might be good preventative maintenance.</p>

<p>Other possibilities:  You could have a bad relay.  There's a fusebox under the hood, and one of the relays (R13) is for the starter.  You should be able to remove the relay, and jumper the connection to determine whether or not the relay is the problem.

"Is starting your car with the A/C on bad?","72612","","<p>I was always yelled at by my father when I was first starting to drive when I left the A/C on when I turned off the car, and then later turned it back on, with the reasoning that I was ruining / decreasing the life of my engine. Is this true? (I currently drive an  '03 Chevy S10, if that matters, though I'm more interested in a general answer).</p>
","<p>Not at all. You may be in some small way reducing the life of your starter, but this would be pretty negligible.</p>

<p>When you start with the A/C switch on, you will be starting with the A/C Compressor clutch engaged, which means the starter must turn both the engine and the compressor; altogether a rather trivial amount of force in comparison to the force needed to spin the motor with the compressor clutched disengaged.</p>

<p>Once you've gotten it started, the compressor would be robbing some non-zero percentage of the motor's power, just as the alternator and power steering pump would. One could argue perhaps for some reduction in fuel economy during the startup process, but hey you've got a cold car to get into.</p>

<p>To put this in perspective, think of hotter climates like Arizona. Most cars have remote starters, and the leave their A/C on full time so that when they start their cars from inside their house, the cabin is a reasonable temperatures. I'm also convinced that engines in those climates last much longer than those from colder ones, due to less extreme temperature transitions.</p>

  <p>What does the power at different rpm mean? Does it mean Car 1 has
  better power than Car 2 because it is at lower rpm?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It depends.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Or does the rpm not affect the power comparison?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> The rpm of the power peak affects the engine's usability for different applications.</p>

<p>The ""peak power"" number is just one point on the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_band"" rel=""noreferrer"">power band</a> of the engine.  Ideally, you'd like to know the entire curve (and how its affected by ambient air temperature, altitude, humidity, phases of the moon, etc):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yMKNW.gif"" alt=""An example of a power curve showing both torque and horsepower.""></p>

<p>In this figure, we see the horsepower and torque curves for two engines (where torque is solid and horsepower is dotted).  Remember, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque#Relationship_between_torque.2C_power.2C_and_energy"" rel=""noreferrer"">torque</a> is the engine working on the axles and, thereby, the wheels and tires.  This is what accelerates the car forward.  </p>

<p>If you know the torque of the engine at a particular rpm, you can <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower#Calculating_power"" rel=""noreferrer"">calculate the horsepower</a> at that rpm:</p>

<pre><code>horsepower = (torque * rpm) / 5252
</code></pre>

<p><em>Admittedly, the above equation is specific to crazy old-time Imperial units.  Insert appropriate conversion factors if you'd like to get metric units out instead.</em>  </p>

<p>Very casually, you can imagine horsepower (or ""power"" if you're being unit agnostic) as being ""that which maintains speed in spite of drag.""  We generally expect a high horsepower vehicle to have a higher top speed (provided that it has the gearing to <em>reach</em> that speed).</p>

<p>Looking at the above equation, you can also see that, in these units, the horsepower and torque curves always cross at 5252 rpms (i.e., the scalar values are equal even though they're totally different units).</p>

<p><strong>So what?</strong></p>

<p>All of the above helps you understand what the manufacturer is telling you a bit better.  What's missing is ""what do you want from a car?""</p>

<p>Going back to the chart, you can see that the blue line has a torque peak at about 2500 rpm and that it doesn't drop off until about 4000 rpm.  This means that, from a stop, the car will feel like it pulls away strongly, right away.  However, as the rpms get much higher, the engine will seem to run out of breath, accelerating much slower at 6000 rpm than it was at 1000 rpm.  Qualitatively, this is what we would expect from a large-ish displacement normally aspirated engine.</p>

<p>The red line has a torque peak at about 5500.  It will feel sluggish from a stop and seem to wake up as the rpms increased.  From 5500 to 7500, the red engine will out-accelerate the solid engine by a significant margin.  This is roughly what we would expect from a smaller engine (and forced injection would only increase this late-rpm peak).</p>

<p>The question for the customer is: <strong>which do you like better?</strong></p>

<p>Qualitative summary:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The early torque peak of the solid line is fun from a standing start but you will need to shift early (trading mechanical advantage to get back to the torque peak).  Hopefully, you have enough gears to get you to top speed.  This profile is often preferred in a street car.</p></li>
<li><p>The later peaks of the dotted line is sluggish from a standing start but becomes progressively more exciting as revs increase.  You won't need to shift as early to stay at peak power, keeping the mechanical advantage for more revs.  This profile is often preferred in a race car.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p><em>Full disclosure: I've owned low-end, high-end and (high-end + turbo) vehicles and I prefer the last combination.  I haven't been interested in standing starts from a red light for many years.</em></p>

"Why does a Turbocharger only produce boost when the engine is under load?","71761","","<p>Why does a turbocharged car only produce significant boost whilst the engine is under load? Is is something to do with how much exhaust is being produced or is there some kind of valve mechanism that controls this?</p>

<p>i.e. running the engine at 3000 RPM in neutral would not produce as much boost as the engine running at 3000 RPM whilst pulling the car uphill in gear.</p>
","<p>Let me lead off with an excellent book on the topic: Corky Bell's <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0837601606"">Maximum Boost</a>.  There is a sound treatment of the basics of turbocharger operation in addition to some dated and esoteric applications that are still interesting.  For example, I find the discussion of turbocharging different types of carburetor to be of intellectual if not practical interest.</p>

<p>To summarize the points called out in your question, here are some of the major aspects of the turbocharged engine that are of interest:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The <strong>air flow</strong>: remember that an internal combustion engine is effectively an air pump.  If we're talking about an engine that is operating ""under load"", we can assume that you've opened the throttle.  For example, when rolling down hill, you don't need to hit the throttle so the entire intake to exhaust path is pumping a smaller air mass.  However, driving uphill will require you to open the throttle (give it gas), adding air to the intake.  This causes the engine computer to add fuel to the mixture.  The fuel-air mixture is burned to produce energy.  The exhaust from this combustion then proceeds to ...</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>turbine</strong>: this is part that looks like the front of a jet engine sitting in the exhaust gas path.  The turbine sits on one end of a spinning shaft.  On the other side is the compressor.  That is the part that actually makes the boost on the intake side of the engine.  The more exhaust gas pushes past the turbine, the more it wants to spin and make boost on the compressor side.  However, there is also ...</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>wastegate</strong>: this is a valve that also sits in the exhaust gas path.  It provides a short cut for the exhaust if the engine does not really need boost at this time.  This can be used for peak boost control (too much boost can physically destroy your engine).  This can be a purely mechanical sprung valve that stays closed up to a certain positive pressure in the intake path and then progressively opens as boost increases.  It could also be under the direct control of the engine computer.  For example, my car (in stock tune) was very annoying in its refusal to stay at peak boost in third gear.  It also would refuse to boost past a certain point with partial throttle.  The engine computer was effectively saying ""no, that's enough fun for now.""</p></li>
</ol>

<p>For example, if I am rolling downhill in gear with my foot off the gas, the throttle is closed.  There isn't enough air mass passing through the intake to exhaust path to make the turbo spin, wastegate or not.</p>

<p>However, the scene changes at the bottom of the hill as we climb the next rise.  I have to open the throttle to get up the hill.  If I'm in low gear, the RPMs will be higher, the exhaust gas energy will be higher and the turbine will spin right up.  However, since I'd require partial throttle at lower gear for the same acceleration, my engine computer might veto boost past a certain point, opening the wastegate.</p>

<p>If I'm in high gear, the RPMs will be lower and I'll have to open the throttle wide open to get up the hill.  However, the exhaust gas volume and velocity will be low and it's possible that I won't have enough energy for the turbo to make <em>any</em> significant positive pressure (e.g., around 40 mph in fifth in my car).  Even though I'd really like to make boost in this situation, I won't be able to.</p>

","<p>The frame ground is needed. Although the engine is bolted to the frame all the connection points are isolated hence insulated by rubber. The reason for the rubber mounts is to isolate the engine vibration and the resulting stress from the frame. Some older vehicles did use a single ground to the block.

"Replaced brake pads - one pad was full, the other was gone. Brakes now very hot after driving","64516","","<p>The content is pretty much contained in the title. When I went to replace the brake pads, one pad was completely gone and the other was almost like new.</p>

<p>Now that I have replaced the pads, the wheel heats up quickly when driving even short distances. </p>

<p>I did notice that one of the guide pins seemed stuck - it did not move at all. Could this be the cause of the heat, and if so, what do I need to replace? Just the pins, or the caliper bracket as well?</p>
","<p>If your guide pins are stuck, the caliper won't be able to slide properly. </p>

<p>With a sliding caliper, when you apply the brake, the piston pushes one pad against the disc (rotor), and simultaneously pushes back against the caliper (Newton's equal and opposite reactions), causing the caliper to slide along the guide pins, and pull the other pad against the disc. If the caliper cannot slide, the second pad remains forced against the disc, and you're effectively driving with half the brakes on on that wheel, hence why it gets hot. You'll find that if you jack up the the car, that wheel is much harder to turn than the other side.</p>

<p>Remove the caliper, and both guide pins. Clean them up until they both slide freely, re-grease and reassemble, using new gaiters if the old ones are damaged (which is quite likely, as that's the usual reason for them siezing). Do the same on the other side so that you know both calipers are in the same condition. </p>

"How do I repair detatched interior roof fabric?","64229","","<p>I have a 2008 Toyota Camry.  The fabric above the rear window has come detached and is sagging.</p>

<p>I plan to use a spray adhesive (Loctite High-Performance) on the yellow foam after taping the window to avoid spray overage.</p>

<p>Is this how I should be repairing this issue?</p>

<p>Photo of issue:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/P9Omb.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>Your suggestion may work for a short period of time, but this is not the way to permanently fix your ceiling. </p>

<p>Your head liner is made with a semi-sturdy backing which has foamed-fabric attached to it. What is happening in your case is the fabric is separating from the foam itself. This happens as the foam starts to deteriorate. Putting adhesive onto the foam, expecting the fabric to stick again will not keep it affixed, but will allow the glue to pull a new layer of foam away, and then it will be more ugly.</p>

<p>There are basically two ways to fix this. The first way is to purchase a new head liner with the fabric already installed upon it. This is a ""ready made"" solution and is fairly easy, yet more expensive to accomplish.</p>

<p>The second way to fix it is to remove the head liner, remove the old fabric and foam backing from the hard part, then go to a fabric store and purchase some head liner material. It will be pretty much what you already have. You'll need to match this as closely in color as you can to your original. When removing the old foam backing, you need to try to get as much as possible off of the head liner backing itself without destroying the backing in the process. Using a firm bristle brush would assist you in making this happen. It makes a mess, but it will get it clean enough without damaging anything. </p>

<p>Once clean, you'll need to lay out your new covering. Ensure it is big enough to cover the entire area, plus some extra over the sides (at least an inch all the way around). Next, lay the new covering bottom side up next to the head liner backing. Spray both of these with spray on adhesive. 3M makes a whole line of these. Depending on the size of the head liner, you'll need probably 2-3 cans of the stuff to ensure complete coverage. Wait for the adhesive to become tacky, but not so it starts becoming dry (or it won't work), probably around 10 minutes ... you may want to test this on a scrap piece of fabric just to get an approximate time frame. When the two sides are tacky, you'll need to have help placing the new fabric upon the head liner. You'll want to let the center droop and touch down first. Then one person will work their side first, allowing it to go into place without leaving folds or voids which would make for ugliness. When one side is done, work the other side. After both sides are together, leave this until the glue is completely dried. Getting it centered both front-to-back and side-to-side is the most difficult part here. After that, ensuring there aren't any gaps or folds or flaps. Just do it slowly and work towards the outside. Once all is down, lightly press on the material to ensure the entire thing is affixed to the hard piece.</p>

<p>Once it is dried, you'll want to cut any holes you'll need for screws, mountings, visors, etc. Don't go overboard or you'll again have ugliness. Once all of the holes are cut, you can re-install the head liner, replace all of the ""stuff"" you took off to pull the headliner. As you are putting it back into place, tuck the 1"" edge you left around the outside up under the head liner. This will hopefully ensure there is no way for the roof to ""fall"" again. </p>

"Does a strut tower bar have any useful effect on chassis stiffness for a car with 100K miles?","63257","","<p>Aftermarket strut tower bars are generally considered to be decorative on many brand new cars.  However, it seems to be a bit more logical that a chassis with 100K miles would have developed some flex and could use a cross-member to stiffen things back up.</p>

<p>Background: the specific car in question is a 2004 Subaru Impreza WRX wagon, daily driver with 110K miles, none of them off road or racing.  (Note from future me: and now it has 190K miles!)</p>

<p>So, the specific questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Does an aftermarket strut tower bar have any measurable effect during an enthusiastic daily commute?</p></li>
<li><p>If so, how do you measure the effect?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I have to admit, there have been plenty of times when I have wished that there was a bar across the engine bar just to give me something to lean on (as opposed to the intercooler!).  That doesn't seem like a sufficient motivator, though.</p>

<p><em>EDIT to follow-up on some of the points in the answers:</em> the fundamentals of the suspension have already been sorted: Hotchkis sway bars with new bushings, KYB Excel struts (that are effectively OEM replacements) with Kartboy endlinks.  This isn't an autocross car but the easy targets have already been addressed.  Now we're literally talking about tightening up an aging chassis.</p>

<p>And the answer can be no, there won't be a difference.</p>
","<p>From my experience with a number of Subarus (my current oldest one being an MY2000 Impreza turbo with PPP and 130,000 miles on the clock) I can state that a strut brace makes an amazing amount of difference to both my usage (definitely enthusiastic) and my wife's (normal commute plus kids to school etc)</p>

<p>It stiffened the handling up significantly, makes cornering feel much more precise and makes her feel safer when driving. This is an old, well used car - and before adding the strut brace it did feel 'tired' - maybe the wrong word, but everything does get looser with age:-)</p>

<p>For me it just makes some maneuvers on the track feel much less likely to upset the balance of the car - essential at 140mph plus!</p>

<p>The first related topic addresses preparing a vehicle for long-term disuse, and maintaining it during those periods.  The second related topic addresses one of the effects of a long-term inactivity on a vehicle.</p>

<p>Here, I'm looking to cover what should be done after the fact.  Say a vehicle has been parked for several months and was neither prepared for this, nor maintained during that period.</p>

<p>What particular adverse effects of long-term un-maintained storage should one be aware of when trying to revive a car in this situation?  What things should be checked or touched on before starting the car?  What measures can be taken at this point to prevent further damage to the vehicle during its first re-start, and facilitate bringing it back to a safe and healthy operational status?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>  Good news.  The car ('96 Lincoln Mark VIII) that prompted me to ask this question has started successfully.  It had been sitting for probably 6-9 months without any preparation.  The battery is definitely toast, and the engine <em>really</em> doesn't like the condition of the gas, but it started pretty well and got around the block a few times.</p>

<p>For the first start, I swapped in the battery from my '94 Jeep Grand Cherokee.  Then, after pulling the Mark VIII out to where I could reach it with jumper cables, I put the original battery back in.  It's had to be jump-started every time since.</p>

<p>The engine is running pretty rough, and I've got a constant (and occasionally flashing) CEL going.  It also turns out that I've got about 3/4 of a tank to burn through before it'll get any really good gas.  I threw in a couple gallons of premium (91 octane around here) and a can of SeaFoam to hopefully help though.</p>

<p>Thanks for the tips, guys!</p>
","<ul>
<li>If you have one available, use a trickle-charger to bring the battery back up slowly, instead of jump-starting it.</li>
<li>Check the tires. They are probably pretty low at this point. See if they are dry rotted (all cracked and ready to wear quickly).</li>
<li>Check all of the fluids in the typical way. Note that it's okay if the oil shows a little low since it's not warm yet.</li>
<li>Check the serpentine belt - like the tires, it is rubber and susceptible to dry rot.</li>
<li>If there is room in the fuel tank, I'd go ahead and fill it up sooner rather than later to get some fresh fuel mixed in with the old.</li>
<li>Keep a baseball bat handy for the pissed raccoon that just lost its house. Hmm, that's actually a good point - if you live out in the boonies, bang around on stuff to scare off the critters. It's a pain to clean animal parts off the engine fan.</li>
<li>Start it up and see how it drives. Take it easy while it warms up. </li>
<li>I'd drive it around for awhile and when it's nice and hot take it to the gas station as mentioned earlier. Then check your warm levels (engine oil and transmission oil) and check again for any leaks now that it's been running for awhile.</li>
<li>I'd probably go ahead and change the engine oil and whatever else is due base on the usual time/mileage.</li>

","<p>The Body Control Module is a computer which controls many things in your car not directly related to the engine.

<p>A Body Control Module is almost always specifically programmed to work with a specific car. For example, a BCM of another vehicle will not open the doors when you use your key or remote. Also, when you try to start the engine it checks the number of the key and a number in the Engine Control Unit as a anti-theft mechanism. Your ECU also does this check, but your BCM can do additional checks like locking the doors to prevent the thief from leaving.</p>

"Is an ""oil life indicator"" a reliable indicator for when to change the oil?","62272","","<p>I have a 2014 Honda Pilot with 3600 miles on it.  Historically I have always changed oil in my vehicles every 3000 miles, using good quality non-synthetic oil.  Now this Honda has an ""oil life indicator"" and it reports the oil still has 60% of it's life left.  The manual says I should change the oil when there is about 15% life left.  This sounds reasonable, but is it?</p>

<p>I plan on keeping this vehicle for a long time.  Should I stick with my every 3000 mile habits or will the ""oil life indicator"" accurately indicate when the oil should be changed to prevent engine damage? </p>
","<p>To the Mechanic suggesting 3000 mile changes, that recommendation has changed considerably.</p>

<p>Several articles and studies have been done disproving the necessity of the 3k change.  On any vehicle in the past 10 years, owners should follow their manufacturers suggested intervals which is usually 5k or closer to 7k for fully synthetic oils.</p>

<p>I'd argue that it does hurt to change your oil every 3k - it hurts my back to do it, it doubles my maintenance costs (at $35 for full syn + a good filter, that adds up if you drive 15k / yr like I do), and it doubles the amount of oil consumed, recycled and produced.</p>

<p>According to Edumunds :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If we had been foolish enough to follow Jiffy Lube's 3,000-mile change
  schedule (which is essentially the advice given by all quick oil
  change outlets and dealership service departments), the Fit would have
  undergone four unnecessary oil changes per year (assuming 15,000 miles
  per year of driving), wasting $369 and 15.2 quarts of perfectly good
  oil. Over five years of the car's life and 60,000 miles of driving,
  this would have amounted to $1,847 and 125 quarts of wasted oil. This
  does not include other ""upselling"" items at each visit, such as cabin
  air filters.</p>

<p>I'll be at <strong>3100RPM then it'll suddenly jump to 5500</strong> in rapid acceleration. </p>

<p>I don't know if it's from the electronic fuel injection system or something, but it just seems weird to me. I've never heard of cars doing this. </p>

<p>Is this natural? If not, what are some problems I should look for?</p>
","<p>Your torque convertor has a convertor lock-up clutch. When reaching a nominal speed and engine RPM the convertor comes on and locks the convertor forming a slip free drive. When you use kick-down or near full throttle acceleration, the convertor clutch unlocks. This allows the stator in the convertor to allow torque multiplication and give the vehicle its fullest acceleration. It also allows a difference in rotational speed of the impeller and turbine - convertor slip. This is the RPM increase you see on the rev-counter and is what happens in normal operation.</p>

<p>If this happens at low speeds, you should allow the repairer you used to check the vehicle, if only to re-assure yourself.</p>

<p>I seem to understand the reasoning behind the ""in gear"" approach, but I do not understand why the schools teach it differently.</p>
","<p>My suggestion is always park with the transmission in gear and the park brake on. Along with curbing the wheels. Gear selection (forward or reverse) on flat ground, I choose reverse. My reasoning is that a vehicle parked curbside is more likely to be struck from the rear. Even a nudge from a careless driver can push the vehicle if it is only held by the park brake. As most vehicles are now front or all wheel drive this means that the front wheels are being used to prevent the wheels from moving if the transmission is in gear. Since most park brakes are holding the rear wheels you have both the front and rear wheels preventing the vehicle from rolling. If you want overkill the U.S. Postal Service requires that vehicles be in gear or Park, the park brake set, the wheels curbed and a chock block used every time the vehicle is unattended.</p>

"Getting the best results sealing head gasket leak with Blue Devil","61686","","<p>The 1998 Subaru Outback I've been having cooling system problems with turns out to have a combustion gas leak into the coolant. I suspected this but couldn't get a test to turn up anything; taking it to a good radiator shop, they were able to detect it. (pH test fluid in the block check kit turned from blue to green.)</p>

<p>If there's no other option I'll tear open the engine and replace the head gaskets (there are two because it's a boxer engine - bleh!) but I'd like to see if I can get by with a temporary fix for a while. The mechanic seemed pretty knowledgeable about this kind of issue, and when I asked him about using Blue Devil to seal it, he agreed it's better than the cheap leak-stop products, and gave it about a 50% chance of success. He told me he'd used it on one of his own vehicles and it worked, but overall sometimes it works and sometimes not.</p>

<p>Since then I've bought a bottle and I plan to try it, but I want to make sure I follow best practices using it, especially since I've had clog/blockage problems with leak-stop products I used in the past. The procedure on the bottle is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Flush cooling system. (done)</li>
<li>Remove thermostat.</li>
<li>Fill system with water, leaving room for Blue Devil.</li>
<li>Start engine while cold and turn heat on max.</li>
<li>Pour product in slowly (30 sec for half bottle) then idle for 50 minutes.</li>
<li>Test drive, let engine cool, re-install thermostat and refill with antifreeze mixture.</li>
</ol>

<p>Any ideas why the thermostat needs to be removed? I plan to do it in any case. Is the reason to make sure the product circulates through the system before it gets hot? This seems to be the intent of step 4 requiring a cold engine.</p>

<p>Aside from that, are there other things I should make sure I do right using this stuff? I want the best chance of having it work (I really don't feel like taking the heads off this thing -- take a look here for why: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yakX-GAV9uE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yakX-GAV9uE</a>) and not ruining the radiator or heater core in the process (although those are lesser concerns).</p>

<p><strong>Update::</strong> I've used the sealer with some partial results. Idling, the coolant doesn't move into the overflow tank at all. However, I still have high pressure building up in the cooling system when driving the car. At least once, I got coolant to move back from the overflow tank into the cooling system after it cooled down, but most of the time it's staying pressurized basically indefinitely, indicating that there's still a leak.</p>

<p>As discussed in the comments, I tried running the car heavy to heat/pressurize it, then removing the spark plugs to try to get the pressure to force the sealant back across the HG towards the cylinders. (I later found this youtube video that recommends roughly the same thing: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YL9QjN7AcW8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YL9QjN7AcW8</a> -- though I did not try actually <em>running</em> the vehicle with spark plugs out) I expected pressure in the cooling system to drop when I removed the plugs, but it didn't. So it seems the leak is extremely intermittent and dependent upon temperature, pressure, or some other condition not always present, and this is making it really hard to get the sealant into the places it needs to be.</p>

<p>Any ideas on making it work? I'm thinking I might try running it with spark plugs removed, one at a time, or if I feel crazy enough even loosening one while the vehicle is running at high rpms... but unfortunately that's really difficult with the plugs way down on the sides...</p>
","<p>I figure I'll post my own answer to the question today since it's the end of my 60 day window to request a refund. After all the things I tried, considering the Blue Devil attempt a failure, and starting the process to request a refund, I finally had success; the seal has held for over a month now.</p>

<p>What it took in the end was driving 4 hours at 70 mph on a cold day, where the temperature gauge on the dash stayed all the way down on ""C"" for the entire drive (made possible by the thermostat having been removed). At the end of the drive, I expected to need to refill the coolant, but only a small amount had been lost, and there was no pressure on the top radiator hose after the engine had cooled.</p>

<p>My best guess for what happened is this:</p>

<ol>
<li>To seal, the product needs a temperature gradient at the point of the leak.</li>
<li>This is supposed to be provided by adding the product to the system immediately after starting the engine, while it's still cold.</li>
<li>But the leak only happened under high engine load.</li>
<li>Active cooling via cold air across the radiator provided a cool enough system to get the necessary temperature gradient at the point of leak while it was actually leaking.</li>

"How to tell if the Control Arm is bad too, or just the ball joint","60636","","<p>I have a 1997 Ford Expedition 4WD truck that has a LOT of wiggle on the front left tire. I'm assuming that this is caused by a bad ball joint. Is that a safe assumption to make?</p>

<p>Assuming that it is, what should I look for to determine whether both the upper and lower ball joints are bad, or just one of them? Also, more importantly, when replacing the ball joint(s), how do I determine whether or not the control arm also needs to be replaced?</p>

<p>Finally, I have basic mechanical knowledge, having replaced simple stuff like shocks, brakes, tires, starters, etc., but nothing super advanced. Is changing the ball joints something that I should even be attempting to do myself?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>I would say that it is not a safe assumption. There are three main places where a wheel could be loose at, assuming the lug nuts are tight. Those are the wheel bearing(s), upper/lower ball joints, or at bushings at the base of the control arm. You might also be getting deflection out of your tie rod ends or steering rack (if equipped) as well. You could also have a combination of the three going bad. There are different things you need to do to check to see if which part is bad. Each involves looking for where the movement is occurring at. In fact, if you jack the front end up and you can wiggle the tire, it is most likely NOT your ball joints, this is because there is spring pressure keeping the ball joints tight. Like I was saying, you really need to check to see where the deflection is occurring in order to diagnose the issue.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If the wheel bearing, you should jack the vehicle up and wiggle the tire while off the ground. If you feel deflection or movement, you need to look at the back side of the tire. If the tire is moving and the rest of the suspension isn't, it's probably the bearing. It could be the inner or the outer wheel bearings, or both.</p></li>
<li><p>If the ball joint, jack up the front end of the vehicle so it is supported on jack stands, but not by putting them under the suspension. Use a frame rail or some other position. Now put a jack under one of the A-frames and jack it up enough to <strong>just</strong> support the spring pressure. You want the jack to be supporting the control arm and for it to be solid. After this process your tire should be about 3-4"" off the ground. Next, place an 8' 2x4 under the center of the tire. You want about 6-8"" to be behind the tire and the rest to be out the front. You are going to use the board as a fulcrum to help you lift the tire up a little bit. Wiggle the board back and forth and notice if there is any movement at the point of the lower ball joint. This should be easier to detect because any movement doing this method means the ball joint is bad. There should be zero deflection between the lower control arm and the spindle. To be honest with you, the upper ball joint rarely goes bad because almost all of the abuse is covered by the lower ball joint (the lower supports the weight of the truck while the upper just keeps the spindle located).</p></li>
<li><p>If you don't see any movement out of the ball joint, you'll need to check the bushings at the base of the control arm. You are looking for major cracking or missing rubber in the bushing. More than likely you won't see movement out of this area, but you may see that it is displaced. It will need to look as though the control arm housing is centered around where the bolts go through. If it looks like it's off to one side or the other, it may be worn out. Check both front and back of both the top and bottom control arms. </p></li>
<li><p>When the vehicle is back on the ground, you can check the tie rod ends. While a helper is in the cab, have them turn the steering wheel from left to right, only going far enough until the wheel stops turning easily. They won't need to move it far enough to actually move the tires. They will probably be going from the 11 to 1 o'clock position of the steering wheel. Just have them do it at a moderate pace (not fast/slow). You are going to be looking to see if there is any movement of the tie rod end but not at steering arm, both sides of the vehicle. You'll want to trace the steering linkage all the way back to the from the steering arm at the spindle to where it meets the steering unit (I don't remember if your year of F150 has a rack-n-pinion or steering box). Every place there is a joint, check to ensure there's no deflection. If there is a rack-n-pinion, you'll most likely have inner tie rod ends at the rack unit. You'll want to see if there is any movement there as well. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>One of the tell tale signs that something is going bad in the steering department is if the dust cover is cracked/split. If a ball joint or tie rod end dust cover is split/cracked, that joint is most likely in the process of dieing. Pay special attention to these areas if you see it. Even if it doesn't show any deflection, it most likely will need to be changed soon. This usually occurs because non-serviceable (sealed) joints have dried out. Due to the crack, it lets dust/dirt in which helps destroy the joint even faster. Once this happens it's only a matter of time.</p>

<p>As far as doing the work yourself, it depends on which part is bad. If you're talking about bushings/tie rods/ball joints, this is a lot of work. If you don't have someone helping you who knows what they are doing, it would be tough to do, even with instructions. I'm not saying you couldn't get it done, but it would be a rough go of it. You would also need some specialized tools, like suspension spring compressor, a ball joint splitter, and ball joint press. Also, changing out the control arm bushings is a lot of work ... very much not easy to get it done right without knowing what you are doing (not intuitive). If you figure out it is the bearings, this is something which you can probably do, but there are a lot of parts which you have to be anal about both in cleanliness and with order/orientation. Then you'll need to know how to get the bearings/races off and the new ones on, as well as how to pack the bearings. </p>

<p>If you want to tackle this yourself, but are unsure of your diagnosis, you may want to take this to a shop and have them do the diagnosis. They should be able to tell you right away what's wrong with it. </p>

"My car has the wrong coolant in it. Now what?","59332","","<p>Hello I realized today after beating my head about my car's <a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/1324/what-can-cause-a-vehicle-to-run-hot-but-not-overheat"">overheating problems</a> that I have the wrong coolant in it. </p>

<p>About a year ago, my car ran dry. At the bottom of the expansion tank was an orange crust(also the manual recommend DexCool.. ). I ignored the Dexcool warning in my manual as one of those ""you also need to take it to a certified dealer to get the oil changed"" type of warnings. So I filled it up with green coolant. Well, reading up more I realize that I'm wrong. </p>

<p>About 6 months ago, I had a wreck and got the radiator replaced(salvaged) and the mechanic(who I'm convinced now is an idiot) filled it up with green coolant along with leaving several leaks. I took it to another mechanic and after fixing the leaks, he also filled it up with green coolant.</p>

<p>So I've been running green coolant for about a year now. How exactly should I go about switching to the proper Dexcool coolant? Would it do more harm than good to switch now? </p>

<p>Also, my car is having problems in that it overheats when sitting in traffic or idling. It doesn't have problems when going 65MPH or so. Could this cause this kind of problem?</p>
","<p>As long as you don't mix the two coolants together you should not have any problem. I run ""green"" coolant in my GM that came with Dexcool, and have been for more than 5 years. You do want to check the ratio of coolant and water as straight coolant (or too much compared to water) will not cool as well.</p>

<p>To answer your question I wouldn't bother switching, if you decide to do so anyway simply flush the system and refill with the coolant of your choice.</p>

<p>To address your overheating concern, if it only overheats sitting still you need to check the fan operation and the shroud around the fan and radiator. Another possibility is the water pump, I have seen the fins wear off and the water pump stop circulating coolant, if yours is starting to do this it may not be circulating enough water at the lower RPM's at idle.</p>

"Is it necessary to 'burn in' or 'break in' a new car?","59200","","<p>I've just bought a new 2011 plate car. I've heard stories of people 'burning in' engines for the first few hundred or couple thousand miles using methods such as:</p>

<li>Varying the revs more than usual throughout the entire range.</li>
<li>Keeping the revs below 3.5k.</li>

","<p>You should perform a new car break-in per the manufacturer's instructions.  That way, if any warranty issues come up, you've done what they said to do.</p>

<p>Generally speaking though (according to the engine builders I've talked to), you do want to vary the RPMs a lot, don't cruise at a steady speed for too long.  None of them hold to the drive slow theory, nor the low RPM only idea (some of them do the initial break-in on the dyno with a series of WOT runs through the first few gears).  More frequent oil changes are a good idea as a new engine will shed a little bit of metal at first.  Usually it's something like initial break-in dyno runs, change oil, drive for 500 miles, change oil, drive for 1000 more miles, change oil, drive for 1500 miles this time, change oil, then onto your normal schedule.</p>

"What disadvantages a car with 4-speed transmission have compared to 5, 6 or 7 speed with similar engine?","58860","","<p>This seemed to be most relevant site to ask my question. I am planning to purchase a new car and my shortlisted car has 4 speed automatic and 1.6 litre engine.</p>

<p>The thing that worries me is that it has 4 speed instead of 5 speed which is very common in similar cars here, and for some reasons I cannot go for the manual, and the top spec 7 speed 1.8 litre model is outside my budget. </p>

<p>I like everything about the car except the point in question. So my questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Will it limit top speed on motorway? (limit here is mostly 120 or 140 km/h) </li>
<li>Will it limit acceleration, hamper overtaking etc? My search revealed that the 1.3 litre 4 speed automatic version is underpowered even within the city, but I have driven the 5 speed manual one and it was OK. Is it because of the smaller engine or the 4 speed transmission? </li>
<li>Any other limitations or issues I may have missed? </li>
</ol>

<p>My use is almost entirely within the city. </p>

<p>For completing the question. The car I am considering is: <a href=""http://www.toyota-indus.com/altis-1-6/"">Toyota Corolla Altis 1.6</a> </p>

<p>And the alternate option is: <a href=""http://www.pakwheels.com/new-cars/honda/city/i-vtec-prosmatec/specifications/"">Honda City Prosmatec</a> (Honda's local website is not opening but the specs here are accurate). </p>

<p>Please let me know if this is the reason to go for the alternate, because except the doubt I have, I like everything about my primary choice. </p>
","<p>For a car that has 4, 5, 6 and 7 gear options, if all else is the same, then your top speed will be the same; all that would change would be your acceleration:</p>

<p>In each gear you have a range where power is at it's highest. Below this gear speed your power is low (have you ever tried to accelerate in 5th from stationary?) And above it you hit the speed limitations of the engine.</p>

<p>So having more gears means you can spend more time in the power band - so acceleration efficiency is improved, however this may be offset by the time it takes to change between gears.</p>

<p>As an example, large trucks may have 12 gears - they need the power to accelerate heavy loads. But as the gear ratios are so close it takes a long time to get up to the top speed.</p>

<p>The top speed itself has nothing to do with the number of gears. All that is important for the top speed is the power and max speed of the engine and the gear ratio of your top gear.</p>

<p>So for question 1 - No
Question 2 - probably the engine size/power
Question 3 - far too broad a question to cover here. I'd suggest removing that one (you should only ask one question at a time)</p>

"How much does spark plug gap affect fuel efficiency?","58621","","<p>I've read conflicting reports regarding how plug gap can affect fuel efficiency.  For example, I've read that too small a gap won't cause a clean burn, or that too large a gap can cause misfires due to the voltage being insufficient to jump the gap.</p>

<p>Beyond manufacture's recommended gap range, is there any hard data on optimizing plug gap for maximum fuel efficiency?</p>
","<p>The generalized statements about the gaps being too small causing insufficient burn and too wide having a weak spark are spot on. As you widen the gap, you need to increase voltage to cover the gap. Also, as you increase pressure at the top of the compression cycle, you'll need to either increase the voltage output to the spark plug and/or reduce the gap of the spark plug. If you don't, the spark will not jump the gap as efficiently and therefor you won't get the best performance out of your vehicle. </p>

<p>I don't know <a href=""http://www.custom-car.us/ignition/spark-plug/gap.aspx"">if this</a> will <em>exactly</em> answer your question, but is about the best I've found thus far (if I find more, I'll add to it), but it makes a lot of sense to me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a rule, a properly gapped spark plug will burn hot without being too wide at high rpm to cause a misfire. Ironically, <strong>the car manufacturer's recommended spark plug gap is not optimal!</strong> The recommended spark plug gap is designed to be adequate for cold starting and smooth driving on a car that is in need of an engine tune up. <strong>If you drive your car normally and tune the engine regularly, you can increase the spark plug gap by about 0.010"" for better performance and better fuel economy.</strong> However, if you drive at <strong>full throttle most of the time, you should reduce the gap by about 0.010""</strong> for better performance. The spark plug itself, and the residue that forms on it, would indicate whether the gap is too big or too small. A light brownish discoloration of the tip of to porcelain insulator indicates the proper operation of the spark plugs with the gap being ideal or close to ideal for the most recent engine speeds. Thus, to check the spark plug gap at high engine speeds, you'd need to run at full throttle and immediately turn the ignition off without allowing the engine to idle. But ultimately, you'd need to run your car on a dynamometer to find the best spark plug gap, and the right ignition timing for your engine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a lot more information on the page which gives indication about how the gap affects things, so it's worth a read in my book.</p>

<p>I would say, though, the <em>ultimate</em> gap range for one vehicle is going to be different than it will be for another. As is stated at the end of the excerpt, <strong><em>you'd need to run your car on a dynamometer to find the best spark plug gap</em></strong>. Any given car is going to be different. Some manufacturers may have the optimal gap set, while others will be a lot more conservative. </p>

<p>All-in-all, I've not found any empirical data which shows exactly what the difference is between gaps on any given vehicle, but as I've stated, every vehicle line is going to be different anyway. This makes it hard to come to a strict conclusion. </p>

"Brake pedal will not return after being depressed: brake booster diagnosis?","58604","","<p>After being on holiday for a few weeks, I come home and find that the car brake pedal on my (automatic tranmission with ABS brakes) car will no longer spring back up after depressing it.  After doing a lot of reading, the problem would appear to be either with the brake booster or the master cylinder.  Unfortunately, I can't really tell what might be the issue since I can't find any information that seems to match my specific conditions. There does not appear to be a return spring on the pedal that is missing.</p>

<p>When engine is off, pumping the brake pedal will eventually allow the brake pedal to return back.  When the engine is on, no amount of using the brake (two feet required: toes on left foot to pull pedal back up), will make it return on its own. I have verified that the brakes still have excellent holding power. When the car is on and in drive or reverse, the brake still engages. I have not tried driving with it because I live in a high density urban setting.</p>

<p>Based on the above, I think the problem is somewhere in the brake booster or the booster hose. I'd like to diagnose it, but am not sure how. Pressing down on the brake is easy and doesnt feel any harder or softer than it used to be. However, starting the car with my foot on the brake pedal does not ""pull"" the brake pedal down an extra few inches.</p>

<p><strong>Can I remove the booster hose from the engine side and blow or suck to test for a seal problem?</strong> I should only be able to suck air. If I can blow air, I know there is a seal problem. The brake booster hose is not a closed system, is it?</p>

<p><strong>Is there a return spring in the brake booster that could have failed? Is it possible to diagnose this?</strong></p>
","<p>So as it turns out, my car -- a Saab 900NG -- did not appear to have a return spring built into the brake booster.  There doesn't seem to have been any evidence of it though there does appear to be a small auxiliary spring built in to help <em>apply</em> the brakes (not disengage them).  The shop merely added a return spring and everything seems fine.  The brakes are not tough, the fluid is fine, the master cylinder was in excellent condition, the booster diaphragm was in one piece, and the hoses were all sound.  The brake lines were also in good condition.</p>

<p>Chalk it up to another Saab-related mystery.  I've had a few of those lately and it makes me want to never have another Saab ever again. </p>

<p>EDIT: It would appear that there may be a return spring on the pedal itself rather than the brake booster.  I am continuing to investigate this.</p>

","<p>Mechanical clutches have a cable for actuation, and typically need adjusting throughout the life of the clutch.  Hydraulically actuated clutches tend to be self-adjusting, as long as there is enough fluid in the reservoir.  However, this does mean that hydraulic clutches can be susceptible to air bubbles in the lines, and water in the system which can lead to premature rusting.

"Ticking noise while idling that increases with acceleration","58061","","<p>2013 Chevy Cruze. 86000 miles.</p>

<p>Our car has been ticking while idling, and the noise gets louder and faster when accelerating. Oil has been changed regularly. Water pump was changed recently due to a leak. Not very car savvy, so I'm not sure what else to say about it...</p>
","<p><strong>It sounds like a valve adjustment is required</strong></p>

<p>There are many items that can make a 'ticking' noise that is tied to the RPM of the vehicle.</p>

<p>Having the sound match RPM's certainly gives a clue that it is associated with the operation of the engine.</p>

<p>Many times a valve adjustment is required.  This is a component of a regular maintenance schedule for almost all vehicles.</p>

<p>A valve adjustment ensures that valve clearance between your camshaft and your valve actuator (there are many different types) is correct.  As normal wear occurs on the motor the gap between the two increases until enough gap is there for you to begin to hear a ticking noise.</p>

<p><strong>other possibilities</strong></p>

<p>There are certainly other possibilities regarding the sound.  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>a bad pully for a belt</p></li>
<li><p>a failing water pump can sometimes make a ticking sound</p></li>
<li><p>an alternator that is beginning to fail can make a ticking sound.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>a way to check</strong></p>

<p>You can get a long screwdriver and place the tip on the valve cover of your engine.  Then press the handle into your ear and push the tragus of your ear over the canal and you will be able to listen to the inside of the engine.  If the valves need to be adjusted you will hear the ticking loud and clear from the valve cover.  </p>

<p>IF not, use the technique to listen around the engine bay to see if you can identify the source.</p>

<p>I have a screwdrivers with 18"" shafts that are easy to do this with.  You could also use a steel or aluminum rod or any other long tool that can transfer the sound through it.  It will need to metal.</p>

"Racing Fuel (100 Octane Rating) - Better than Premium?","57570","","<p>Earlier today while driving out East on Long Island I stopped to fill my tank with gas, and at the station, all the pumps had the usual Regular, Mid, Premium on one pump, but on the 2nd pump which typically holds Diesel, there was a sticker for Racing Fuel.</p>

<p>The button for the fuel indicated a 100 Octane level, whereas the Premium was 93. Now although I've seen Sunoco do 95 Octane for maybe a dime more than the Premium fuel, the ""Racing Fuel"" at this station (LukOil) was $8.99 a gallon!</p>

<p>At first I thought someone messed up the signage as a joke, but after putting my card in the pump to pay, the prices lit up and the 100 octane had $8.99 as the price. This also was the same at the other pumps, and on the major road sign when pulling out.</p>

<p>All the other fuels were from $3.65 to I think $3.90.</p>

<p>After seeing this, my main question isn't to ask about Premium vs. Regular octane levels, but rather I'm curious about if such fuel is safe to use in your typical stock engine on a passenger car, and in addition whether this ""Racing Fuel"" has anything more than extra octane because I know Sunono Super Premium is typically 10-20 cents higher than premium.</p>

<p>Also, is this a new major line of fuel that's going mainstream? I've only seen this once at the chain -- every other LukOil carries Diesel instead, so I'm not sure if this might be a regional offering.</p>
","<p>A lot of performance Japanese cars are tuned for higher octane fuels from the factory, and will often pink badly on anything less than 97. I suspect the ""Racing Fuel"" will have other additives as well. If your car is tuned for 93 it would probably still run on 100, but certainly won't run well. (out of interest, what ratings are ""regular"" and ""mid"" - here we have ""premium"" at 95 and ""super"" at 97 or 99)</p>

<p>The reason you will occasionally see ""Racing Fuel"" sold in petrol stations (usually near race tracks) is that a lot of series require competitors to use ""pump fuel"" - By making it available to the public it counts as pump fuel and so can be used in the races.</p>

"Differences and Recommendation between Steel and Alloy Wheels for Winter?","57442","","<p>There are many discussions regarding steel vs. alloy wheels in Winter on multiple forums. It would be good if someone could <strong>lay out full facts and help scale these differences (questions below)</strong>.</p>

<p>For Steel wheels:</p>

<ul>
<li>Less expensive</li>
<li>Uniform and made mostly of stamped steel</li>
<li>May bend from potholes or any collisions</li>
<li>Rusts if the paint layer wears off</li>

<li>Mostly cast aluminum alloys</li>
<li>More sturdy through potholes, will crack and break on hard collisions</li>
<li>Salt will wear off the alloy</li>
<li>Better looks and choice in design</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The key questions are as follows. Please remember we are talking about a winter in Montreal, QC, meaning lots of potholes and salt on the roads in addition to parking in a heated garage at night:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is there a noticeable difference in handling due to the added weight
of steel wheels? (seems to be 5-10 lbs more per wheel, ignore the salt and potholes for now) (scaling safety and performance)</p></li>
<li><p>Are there safety concerns due to the potential bending of the steel wheels or are minor impacts from pothole too minor to be a concern? I.e.: During an accident, would the wheel type be a factor in the amount of damage to the rest of the car parts? (scaling safety)</p></li>
<li><p>Would winter and salt do more damage to steel or alloy wheels? In what ways, quantify the amounts.</p></li>
<li><p>What is the best long term value given that steel wheels may bend while both types may get salt damage and require replacement/repairs? (scaling costs)</p></li>
<li><p>Bonus question 1: Is there a noticeable difference in performance and safety of lighter and higher performance alloy wheels compared to standard ones. (E.g.: Enkei Performance or Tuning Series to unbranded alloys)</p></li>
<li><p>Bonus question 2: Are there pre-treatments to steel wheels that would help prolong its lifespan by reducing the occurrence of rust? Assuming the steel wheels come painted.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Thank you! I hope we could get answers, facts and discussions of the same quality as other Stack Exchange sites!</p>

<p><strong>More Information:</strong> I forgot to mention it will be for the second set of wheels dedicated to Winter Tires. Car is a 2001 Subaru Forester S but in good condition!</p>
","<p>Bob cross makes some good points, however, I would offer the following opinions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Winter tires don't have the dry grip that summer tires do. Your ""high performance"" handling will be limited with your winter tires on. Therefore, I wouldn't be too concerned about the incremental difference in handling due to the difference in unsprung weight between steel and alloy wheels. So while Bob Cross is absolutely correct that lighter wheels do handle and ride better, it may not be worth it to spend the additional money for lighter wheels <em>for your winter tires</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>In terms of resistance to bending when you hit potholes, any wheel can be damaged when driven through potholes. The best protection is to pick a wheel/tire combination with a reasonably tall sidewall, keep the tires properly inflated, and avoid driving through potholes! With winter tires, I generally choose a smaller wheel diameter and taller tire sidewall than for my summer tires. This affords me more protection from pothole damage, and I enjoy the softer ride in the winter months. Again, high-speed dry cornering won't be great with winter tires, so I see no point in buying big wheels and low profile snows. As far as your steel/alloy choice goes, resistance to damage from potholes wouldn't play into my calculus. Steel wheels are also easy to repair should they get bent.</p></li>
<li><p>In terms of salt damage resistance, Bob is again correct that either wheel type can be damaged by salt exposure. I would add that with a steel wheel it's really easy at the end of the winter season to quickly wire-brush off any flaking paint and rust, then touch up the wheel with a can of spray paint. Its easier to match the (typically flat) paint on a steel wheel than to do a high-quality touch up of a glossy painted alloy. The steel wheels may develop rust spots more often than you'd notice chipped paint/salt damage on an alloy, but its just so easy to touch up the steel wheels. With my alloy wheels, I give them a good washing and a coat of good hard wax at the end of the season, which really increases its resistance to salt damage (and brake dust staining for that matter).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So here's how I think about the steel/alloy choice for winter wheels: It's boils down to almost purely an aesthetic question. Do you like the looks of the alloys better? If so, how much are you willing to pay for that? I've had both types, both are fine choices. Where I grew up, we had long winters, so we had to look at our cars with the winter wheels on for quite a while. This may have pushed us in the alloy direction a bit more. However, I also think some cars can look great with a set of black steel wheels. </p>

<p>Don't agonize over the decision, instead, congratulate yourself for making a great choice about buying a second set of wheels and dedicated winter tires. Its the single best thing you can do for winter driving safety.</p>

"Low-side and high-side pressures lower than expected after AC repair","56904","","<p>I just did my first automotive AC repair, after the compressor in my 2004 Lancer 2.0 ate itself, cracked its casing, and blew all the refrigerant out.</p>

<p>I think I did the repair &amp; recharge correctly-- and the AC is blowing very cold-- but I'm concerned that the operating pressures are not anywhere close to what they are spec'd to be.</p>

<p>(During recharge, I added ~18oz of r134a, per the yellow sticker under the hood.)</p>

<p>Before recharging, I googled 'r134a pressure chart', and found the following:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SBEAL.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SBEAL.jpg"" alt=""r134a pressure chart""></a></p>

<p>At the time, it was 82F in my garage, so I was expecting to end up in the middle of the range (both low- and high-pressure) for the 80F row.... 45psi for low, and about 190psi for the high side.  (When referring to this chart, I assumed that the target low readings were for when the clutch was disengaged, and the target high readings were for when the clutch was active.)
However, after my recharge the highest low reading I see (right before clutch engages) is 40psi, and the highest reading I ever see for the high side is 150 (right before the clutch disengages.)</p>

<p><strong>Should I be concerned about these low operating pressures, given my starting ambient temperature?</strong>  This car is 11 years old, and so the computer &amp; pressure switch have about 160K miles on them.</p>

<p>As I said, AC appears to be working very well.  The compressor clutch cycles about 12 seconds on, and 12 seconds off.  (I'm not sure what's an exceptable duty cycle there.  Also I was parked in a garage, not running down the road, air flow through the condenser wasn't exactly real-world.  Of course the fans kicked on whenever the clutch engaged.)</p>

<p>Static pressures (with engine off): 80-85 for both high and low sides.</p>

<p>In case anyone has questions about my methodology, this is what I did:</p>

<ol>
<li>Remove old compressor, condenser, dryer, and expansion valve</li>
<li>Flush lines and evaporator with recommended flush solvent</li>
<li>Installed (all new) compressor, condenser, dryer, and expansion valve, coating all rubber seals with PAG oil</li>

","<h2>That chart is not universal. You should be fine.</h2>

<p>Every model will have its own characteristic low-side and high-side pressures.</p>

<p>This is why some manufacturers recommend charging refrigerant by mass rather than by high-side, low-side and ambient temperature values.</p>

<p>As long as you have charged the system with the correct amount of refrigerant (which you have according to the tolerance defined in your manual), you should be fine.</p>

<p>Another sanity check is that the low-pressure switch activates at 32 psi, which is lower than the 40 psi you are seeing on the low-side.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if your Lancer is equipped with a high-side pressure switch but the same principle applies.</p>

<p>Enjoy your ice-cold AC!</p>

<h2>P.S.</h2>

<p>Some observations about your procedure:</p>

<ul>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>Pulled vacuum to almost -30psi, observed that level held for 1 hour</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This tells me that there are no leaks.</p></li>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>Added UV dye and 1.75 oz of PAG-46 oil to condenser </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The UV dye is added if you want to detect leaks with UV light. Else it shouldn't be necessary. PAG-46 is the right oil for your car and is <em>absolutely</em> necessary to since it lubricates the internals of the compressor.</p></li>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>This car is 11 years old, and so the computer &amp; pressure switch have about 160K miles on them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not sure about the Lancer, but on some vehicles the pressure switch is a capacitor where the refrigerant pressure controls the distance between the two plates, thereby altering capacitance and voltage.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Once again, the level of detail provided in this question is stellar. I'd consider this to be the golden standard for all AC-related questions.</p>

"Fixing a water-damaged remote key","56213","","<p>I have a Toyota Camry 2011 and two remote keys. One of the keys was soaked with water two years ago. Of course, it is not working. I went to a dealer and they failed to recover it.</p>

<p>Is there something I can try to fix it myself?</p>
","<p>If you can access the electronics soon after they get wet, the chances are pretty good to keep it working.  Unfortunately, after all this time, it's kind of a long shot.</p>

<p>There are three major things that happen when you get a circuit board wet:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The battery voltage can short across to the wrong parts of the circuit.  This will cause it to fail, but seldom does any lasting damage.</p></li>
<li><p>The metal parts of the circuit will corrode.  This is generally what kills the circuit.  The corrosion can be conductive, and so will cause permanent shorts on the circuit board.  This is especially common between pins of an integrated circuit, because they are so close together.  Severe corrosion can actually eat though the the metal, causing open circuits.</p></li>
<li><p>The battery will start draining rapidly.  In addition to killing the battery, the current flow really speeds up the corrosion process.  In an extreme case, a battery will leak or explode.  But I've never heard of that happening with small coin-cell batteries.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Anyway, enough of the problems.  Here's what to do when a circuit gets wet:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Take care of it immediately.  The longer you wait, the more likely that it can't be fixed.  Five minutes is way better than fifteen :)</p></li>
<li><p>Remove the case.  It's important to get the water off of the board quickly, and it will never evaporate when there's no airflow.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove the battery, if possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Get the water off of the circuit.  This is more difficult than it sounds, because it won't come out from underneath the chips on the circuit board.  One good way is to dump rubbing alcohol (99%, not 70%) over the board.  It will wash the water away, and then evaporate very quickly.  Also, this will remove any salts or contaminants that were in the water.  Don't use rubbing alcohol if you weren't able to remove the battery!</p></li>
<li><p>Let it dry.  If you were able to use 99% rubbing alcohol, this should take less than an hour.  If not, give a full day of two to completely dry out.  Putting it on a sunny windowsill would help.</p></li>
<li><p>Put it all back together.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I've done this with a half-dozen usb keys, a rental car key (that I swam with in Hawaii!), and the guts of a remote-controller helicopter.  They all recovered :)</p>

<p>For your specific case, I'd try to scrub the corrosion off of the board and the battery contacts.  For the circuit board, use an old toothbrush with 99% rubbing alcohol.  For the battery contacts, you can be more forceful :)</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>

"Can coasting in neutral damage an automatic transmission?","55788","","<p>When I drove a manual transmission, I got in the habit of shifting to neutral on long, shallow grades to save fuel. Now I'm driving an automatic (specifically, a recent Corolla) and still doing it.</p>

<p>But someone told me recently that being in neutral while moving can cause an automatic transmission to overheat, since the fluid is not being circulated.</p>

<p>Is this correct?</p>
","<p>I don't think it will make a difference on gas mileage either way. Anytime the engine is running the front pump on the transmission is being turned by the torque converter and is lubricating the transmission which is also circulating fluid through the transmission cooler.</p>

<p>I don't see how it could cause premature failure of the transmission. Technically you are shifting out of gear and back into gear one extra time when you decide to do this, but it's not really any different that a regular shift so it shouldn't cause extra wear.</p>

"Is it normal for the oil to be dark in color right after an ""oil change"" in a 10-year old diesel car?","55502","","<p>I took my 2002 Jetta TDI wagon to a <a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz/best-service-and-repair-seattle-2"">neighborhood shop</a> about 10 miles, 24 hours ago. They supposedly changed the oil, but the color is very dark, almost black. Definitely not light-colored/transparent. The oil change was performed along with other work (replacing alternator &amp; brake pads).</p>

<p>I'd run it back right away without a thought, but I'm wondering if this is normal for a 10-year old diesel car with 175,000 miles on it. Last oil change was made around 10,000 miles ago. The engine is original, too.</p>

<p>Not sure if this is relevant, but I always have 5% to 99% biodiesel and Diesel Kleen in the fuel tank.</p>
","<p>It's a Diesel, which means that you usually have a high detergent oil in an engine that dumps combustion by-products like soot into the oil as part of its normal operation. Given the age of the vehicle I'm not surprised that the oil has noticeably darkened after 10 miles - one of the older Diesels I owned a while back did that during the time it took to run up the engine after the oil change and fill the oil filter.</p>

<p>Also, when changing the oil, you'll never get all the oil out of the engine so the new engine oil will mix with a little oil that already contains combustion byproducts. This is nothing to worry about (it's usually a very small amount of oil that is left in the engine), but it'll also lead to oil darkening fairly quickly.</p>

"Switching from Reverse to Drive - always stop completely?","55132","","<p>I've been told by a couple people that it's really bad for a car to be shifted from Reverse to Drive while the car is still moving backwards.  Is this true?</p>

<p>In my experience:</p>

<p>On automatic cars, this could be true - most cars I've tried this on (not often, mind you, since I don't want to destroy cars that aren't mine) jerk strongly when switched.</p>

<p>On manual cars, however, I've noticed the opposite; rather than a strong jerk, there feels like what I'd call a 'winding'-like sensation - the car slows down and then moves forward smoothly.</p>

<p>So, again, is this a bad thing to do?  On all cars or just some?  If just some, is it a make-and-model kind of thing, or an automatic/manual thing?</p>
","<p>A lot of newer cars are smart about shifting (they have electronic solenoids to control the hydraulics). I can put my 2001 Nissan Pathfinder in reverse at 50 MPH, and it's smart enough to not engage, it goes into neutral. However, at speeds below its cutoff point (I've done it at about 15 MPH and regretted it), you can put a lot of stress on the drivetrain if you shift into drive from reverse (or vice-versa). Even more so if you shift and apply the accelerator.</p>

<p>But when you are moving slowly, like 5 MPH or less? No, no harm--at least in the automatics I have experience with. The transmission will shift through neutral first, relieving any preload. Then when it shifts to drive or reverse, the torque converter will take the mismatched speeds (RPM), that's what it's designed to do. The problems arise when the torque converter engages strongly due to a high RPM difference, and this can shock the drivetrain and break stuff.</p>

<p>In manuals it all depends on how long you slip the clutch. I could make a change from reverse to 1st at 20 MPH be smooth. At least, as long as the clutch and synchronizers last.</p>

"What's making my coolant overflow?","54982","","<p>I got home to find a trail of coolant down the driveway and puddles forming under the car (1991 Toyota MR2 - 5SFE).

<p>Here's the weird things:  Temperature gauge was perfectly normal the entire drive home, not high, not low.  The coolant in the overflow was cold (room temperature), I expected it to be hot.  No smell of coolant burning/cooking off either.</p>

<p>Once the engine cools down I plan on checking the oil cap for residue and the dipstick for level/residue, but if it was a headgasket the coolant should be hot.  Ditto for thermostat &amp; fans.  Water pump failure and the gauge should have either gone high or low, not stayed normal.</p>

<p>I'm baffled.  No prior indication of any problems.  Seemed to happen out of the blue.  Ideas?</p>
","<p>No one's mentioned the simplest thing yet.  If the system is overfilled, it will overflow.  As it heats up, the coolant expands and that is why you don't fill up the overflow bottle all of the way.  (If you are pouring fluid directly into the radiator, you do fill it up completely.)</p>

"How to diagnose a starter motor that does not work","54927","","<p>My e46 M3 would not start when I got to the parking garage after work. When I first turned the key, I heard a sound like grinding gears, but I was so startled that I immediately stopped trying to crank the engine. The interior lights and radio flashed for a fraction of a second when this happened, and the clock on the dash reset itself. A couple of seconds later I tried cranking again, but all I got was the sound of the starter relay clicking away. The engine did not turn over, nor did I hear any grinding noises. Is it the starter, or something else? How would I check this?</p>

<p>I should also mention that I was able to push-start the car and get it running, since it has a manual transmission.  Thanks!</p>
","<p><strong>Your battery was dead.</strong></p>

<p>In many cars, when the battery can't provide enough cranking amps, you will hear a clicking instead of the normal starting sound.</p>

<p>The starter battery draws a lot of current. When that happens, the voltage available to the rest of the system drops dramatically, especially if the battery is weak. That's why your clock reset itself.</p>

<p>Hook up a smart charger. A cheap one is a <a href=""http://batterytender.com/automotive/battery-tender-junior-12v-at-0-75a.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Battery Tender Jr</a>. Avoid a dumb charger, which will gladly push 13.8V at 2A in to your battery until all the electrolyte has boiled away. A good charger will have bulk, absorption, and float stages. A really good one will have a desulfate stage, which can help revive an older battery. </p>

<p>You need to figure out whether the problem is in your charging system or in the battery. A mechanic or a battery shop will have a testing tool that will measure the <strong>CCA</strong> of your battery. To get the best possible test, charge the battery to full, then <strong>let it rest</strong> disconnected for 24 hours. If the number is very low, your battery can't do the job. Letting a desulfating charger work for a long time may make a difference, but if this is your daily driver and you don't have a spare battery, you probably should just replace it.</p>

<p>If you decide to replace your battery, check out <a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/q/113/26"">How do I apply dielectric grease to my battery?</a></p>

<p>If the battery checks out, then the problem is in your charging system. Perhaps there's a loose connection, or perhaps your alternator is bad. See your service manual for instructions on troubleshooting the charging system. You'll definitely want a good <strong>multimeter</strong> at this point, with 3 1/2 digits of precision.</p>

<p>Remember that batteries have lead, produce hydrogen, and can get acid on things. Nitrile gloves, goggles or face mask, clothes you want holes in, and wash up well afterward.</p>

"Driving in second gear at 65+ mph","54668","","<p>I accidentally drove my 2000 Grand Marquis on second gear on the highway. I was going 65 for like 5 minutes and tried to get it to 70mph but the car was shaking, when I realized I put it into regular drive while going 65 and it stopped shaking.</p>

<p>Is there any damage that this can do to my car?</p>
","<p>It's definitely not great.  The redline is there for a reason.  That shaking was likely the engine speed limiter looking at the RPMs and saying, ""yes, that's high enough.""  The speed limiter can be either an ignition cutoff or a fuel cutoff - both will make the car feel very shaky.</p>

<p>The most common bad consequence of an overspeed condition when the engine speed limiter fails to thwart the operator is a bent valve.  There's a lot going on in the engine when it's turning at several thousand RPMs: if the valve does not have time to return to its seat before the piston comes back up, the piston is going to hit the valve harder than you would like.</p>

<p>Of course, that's not the only possibility, just the most common that I've heard of.</p>

<li>Remove it.</li>

<li>Ground it on the frame.</li>
<li>Start and check if sparks happen.</li>
<li>If they are blue, the spark plug is ok. Else if the sparks are yellow or there is no spark at all then the spark plug is bad.</li>
</ul>

<p>While this method may work in most of the case, it does assume that the wiring/spark plug cable etc. are doing their job properly.</p>

<p>Basically, I'm looking for a way that would confirm that I get no fire because the spark plug are bad and not because there is any other background problem such as bad spark plug cable etc.</p>

<p><em>Is there any other way to check if a spark plug is working properly so I can eliminate the case of bad spark plug when I get no fire ?</em></p>
","<p>First of all, check the image in <a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/a/11444/4152"">this link</a> to diagnose the state of the spark plug. Look for cracks in the porcelain of your spark plugs, as this is a sure sign it is bad (electricity leakage will occur). Even if it's working now, it will soon fail.</p>

<p>Next, to check the spark plug lead, you can check it by ohming it (checking the resistance of the wire). A conventional plug wire has a resistance of 10,000 to 15,000 ohms per foot of length: if it's measurably higher, the wire probably is bad. An absolutely failed wire will have a hairline break somewhere, and the resistance will be infinity. </p>

<p>Also, if you have a known good spark plug (good tan color), you can swap it into the position of the possible bad plug and see if it miss follows the possible spark plug or if the known good spark plug is now not firing. </p>

<p>Something else to consider when testing the spark plug outside of the combustion chamber (your described method) is that the spark doesn't travel as well under pressure (as you'd see during compression inside the combustion chamber) as it does under no pressure (in normal atmosphere as you'd see outside the combustion chamber). Just because you see spark when testing as you did, does not <em>prove</em> the spark plug isn't having issues during normal running operation.</p>

"Red vs black vs grey RTV - what's in a color?","54048","","<p>When buying gasket maker at my local auto-supplies store some time back, I was unsure about whether or not the color of the tube made any difference. The only thing I could see was a different temperature rating on the tube itself.</p>

<p>At the time I chose black because it had a higher temperature rating than red, but was concerned because the relevant forum was suggesting to use grey RTV for timing cover reassembly.</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<ul>
<li>What do the different colors signify?</li>
<li>Are there other colors that I am not aware of?</li>
<li>Is operating temperature the only differentiating factor? What about properties like cure time and water/oil resistance?</li>
<li>Are there automotive applications where I should use only one type of RTV and not others?</li>
</ul>
","<p>Since every manufacturer can use whatever color they want to create their flavor of gasket material. RTV or <em>Room Temperature Vulcanization</em> sealants come in many types, colors, flavors, and work to seal for many different occasions. Also remember that each manufacturer may utilize the same color for <em>different</em> means. Black sealant is <em>very commonly used</em> in the manufacture of sealants. This just adds more to the confusion.</p>

<p>Not that I have empirical evidence of such, but I believe Permatex is <em>most likely</em> the preeminent maker of RTV gasket maker. They have a whole list of other products as well, but the sealants they make <em>do work pretty well</em>. I'll use their colors scheme to describe the differences and when they should be used. Ultimately, though, it comes down to <em>reading the package</em> as to if the product you are looking at is right for your needs. </p>

<p>Permatex has several different <em>types</em> of sealants. Most of which are RTV, but some specify use in anaerobic situations where there isn't any air to do the curing. I will try to break out the different types of sealants and how they are utilized:</p>

"Low beam headlights out, High beam working","53854","","<p>The patient is a 1996 Chevrolet Caprice with dual-filament bulbs. Both filaments in both bulbs light up in high beam mode, but no filament on either bulb lights up in low beam mode. What could be broke and how do you fix it?</p>
","<p>The bulb modules could actually be bad, despite both filaments coming on in high beam mode.  Pull the connector at each bulb, there will be three wires: tan, green and black.  The black is ground, tan is low and green is high.  Make sure there is power on the tan wire when the headlights are on and the high/low switch is set to low.  If the tan wire is hot, replace the bulb modules.  The bulbs will be easier to get out if you remove the battery and the air box.  Each bulb is secured by a plastic collar.  Rotate it clockwise to disengage, then pull the bulb out and undo the connector.  Reverse the process to reinstall. </p>

<p>If the tan wire is not hot, look for the dimmer switch on the side of the steering column. The connector may be accessed without taking off the bits of the dash or dropping the column, though removing the access panels will make it easier.  The outer plastic panel/hatch comes off after removing two screws.  Removing that will reveal a metal panel with four bolts.  Removing that opens a space to access the column wiring, though you may need to remove the metal collar around the column.  The connector has a yellow wire, a tan wire and two green wires.  Jump the connector for the yellow wire (from the headlamp on/off switch) to the connector for the tan wire (to the bulbs).  If the low beams come on when bypassing the switch, replace the switch.  To get at the screws/bolts holding the switch to the column, you might need to remove the lower dash and drop the column.  The lower dash comes out if you remove all the screws (you have to take the ashtray out to get at one), open the glovebox and gently pull.  The column is secured by two bolts.  Don't forget to undo the shift indicator cable before dropping the column.  It just clips on to the shift collar (note where). </p>

<p>If the low beams don't come on when jumping around the switch, check the wiring between the switch and the bulbs.  The tan wire from the switch goes into the body harness and through the firewall.  There is a connector (C101) around the washer fluid tank that would be a convenient place to check if you can find it (look for the green and tan wires going to the bulb on driver's side).</p>

<p>The most likely scenario is bad bulbs.  The next is a bad dimmer switch followed by wiring faults at various points. </p>

Could you get by replacing this every other oil change?</p>
","<p><strong>You need to change the oil filter every oil change.</strong> In fact some of the longer lasting oils like Amsoil suggest you change your filter out at normal change intervals if you don't use their filters.</p>

<p>The filter is very important in the scheme of things. While the oil may be able to stand up to the longer interval, once the filter gets full enough, it will start bypassing unfiltered oil directly back into the mix. This ensures your engine won't fail outright from oil starvation. It also means you have all of the dirt and particulates causing havoc within your engine. By replacing the oil filter at every oil change, your chances of this happening are far less.</p>

"'01 Jeep Cherokee - Check Gauges light & low battery gauge","52350","","<p>Bought my '01 Cherokee back in March &amp; have had nothing but problems since; I've been slowly fixing them when I have the time/cash. However, this particular issue has me stumped (and it's happened twice now).</p>

<p>Today, I was driving along when my check gauges light came on and my battery gauge plummeted to 0. My windows, windshield wipers, blinkers, etc; all electronics were incredibly sluggish. I was able to limp-it back home and start some troubleshooting. Tried to start it up &amp; it kept acting as though it needed a jump. This actually happened before, but I was able to tighten the cables on the terminals and wiggle the wires a bit to get everything to work properly again. Having had this problem before and thinking it didn't just ""need a jump"": first, I replaced my battery cables as the old ones were corroded, I had to splice some stuff because I couldn't afford the factory replacements; I don't believe that is the issue, though. </p>

<p>Still nothing.</p>

<p>Next, I lugged my battery up to Advanced Auto, did a check and ended up having to replace it, too. BAM! Started up like nobody's business. This victory was short lived, though. After a single minute of driving: ""Check Gauges"" lights up &amp; battery shows as 0.</p>

<p>Now that this has happened a second time and having replaced the cables <strong>AND</strong> replaced the battery, I am at a loss of what to do next.</p>

<p>I'm thinking of taking it in somewhere, but I'd really like to see if I can find &amp; fix this problem myself first.</p>

<p>Any suggestions would be appreciated.</p>

<h1>//UPDATE</h1>

<p>After testing the battery (per Larry's suggestion), I have a few more details. </p>

<ul>
<li>The battery is putting out plenty of volts on it's own with engine off.</li>
<li>Before the light comes on and the gauge falls to 0, my battery gauge <strong>hovers</strong> at 12; meaning, the needle will move to just before or just after the 12V hash line intermittently </li>
<li>The <strong>Check Gauges</strong> light will <em>only</em> come on after it's hit third gear and has been running in it for a least 10 seconds. I tested this for about 5 minutes riding around my neighborhood in 1st and 2nd trying to keep it under 3rd. Once I hit the main streets, the light came on within 10-15 seconds. I tried this twice.</li>
<li>After checking with a DVOM <strong>while the light is on</strong>, the voltage is right around 12V. </li>
<li>After that, I restarted and checked it while idling (no driving first, light off): same voltage.</li>
</ul>

<p>What should be my next step? Thanks!</p>
","<p>If you have a DVOM (digital volt ohm meter) check the voltage of the battery when this is happening. I suspect that the alternator is not charging. The voltage with the engine running should be (roughly) between 13 - 14 volts, anything less than 12.6 means the alternator is not charging.</p>

"What to do when the wireless key fob battery dies on a 2005 Hyundai Elantra","51685","","<p>I have a 2005 Hyundai Elantra.  This morning the battery on my wireless key fob died, so I'm unable to use it to unlock the car.  From past experience, I know that unlocking the car using the physical key will set off the alarm.  </p>

<ul>
<li>How can I turn off the alarm after unlocking the car with the physical key?  </li>
<li>Should I be able to replace the battery in the key fob myself, or will I have to take it to a dealer or somewhere else?</li>
</ul>
","<p>From the owners manual.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Alarm Stage</strong></p>
  
  <p>The alarm will be activated if any of the following occurs while the
  car is parked and the system is armed.</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>A front or rear door is opened without using the transmitter or the ignition key.</li>
  <li>The trunk lid or tail gate is opened without using the transmitter or the ignition key.</li>
  <li>The hood is opened.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>The siren will sound and the turn signal lights will blink
  continuously for about 30 seconds (This will repeat 3 times). To turn
  off the system, unlock the door or trunk lid/tail gate using the
  transmitter or the ignition key.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Disarmed Stage</strong></p>
  
  <p>The system will be disarmed by using the transmitter or the ignition
  key.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now the way that reads it seems that opening the door with the ignition key won't make the alarm go off. In my experience it means if you use the ignition key to turn on the ignition it  will disarm the alarm. Most cars I am familiar with will do some type of pre-warning when the door is unlocked using the key, and if the ignition key is used to start the vehicle within x number of seconds the alarm will not go off. Even if it goes off in your case try starting the car and that may silence the alarm.</p>

<p>As far as battery replacement the owners manual also addresses that.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Replacing the battery</strong></p>
  
  <p>When the transmitter's battery becomes, it may take several pushes on
  the button to lock or unlock the doors, and the LED will not light.
  Replace the battery as soon as possible.</p>

"My car's coolant temperature reaches almost 100 C / 212 F in a fast pace","51549","","<p>Today, after a very hot day, I saw that my coolant was almost reaching 100C/212, I pulled over, stopped and took a look over the hood. The very little water that remained in the coolant tank was all boiling. So, I went to a gas station, bought some water and refilled the tank.

<li><p>I would like to <strong>drive</strong> the car to the nearest qualified service, but there is a fair distance to it (about 8km) as I'm living in a remote location. Is it safe to <strong>drive</strong> it that distance if I refill the entire coolant tank?</p></li>

</blockquote>

<p>I would say yes, you can drive the car.  Load the car with much more water than you think necessary: I find that two liter soda bottles make excellent transport and pouring vessels for this sort of thing.  While driving, watch your gauge: if you see a high reading, get out and add water to the overflow tank (never open a hot radiator cap).  Repeat as necessary.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The water is clearly doing what it is supposed to do: carry heat away from the engine.  Unfortunately, something is preventing the heat from leaving the water (e.g., sludge as previously mentioned, fouling in the cooling fins or just impeded airflow) <em>or</em> you have a leak.</p>

<p>I think that your instinct to go straight to a service station is a great idea.</p>

<p>If, however, you were to choose to try to diagnose this situation yourself (which I'm not recommending if you're not feeling confident), you could try running the car up to temperature, turning it off and listening and looking for a pressure leak (hissing and / or white steam).</p>

<p>For clarity, never never <strong>never</strong> feel around for a steam leak with your bare hands.  Best case: you'll get a terrible burn.</p>

<p>Following up on that last paragraph to add this lovely quote from <a href=""http://www.howtospotapsychopath.com/2012/05/27/you-dont-want-to-meet-michael-palin-there/"">Dan</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Clouds, and the visible ""steam"" squirting out of a kettle or a steam
  locomotive, are liquid water droplets with a ceiling temperature of
  100°C at sea-level air pressure. It's possible for actual
  invisible-vapour steam to be swirled in with condensed droplets as it
  mixes more or less chaotically with the outside air, but ""pure"" steam
  is invisible, and has no ceiling temperature. Put your hand in the
  visible portion of the steam coming out of the side of a locomotive
  and you may get scalded, but putting your hand in the invisible jet
  close to where it's exiting may flense the flesh from your bones.</p>

"Is it Safe to Drive With Low Engine Coolant?","51312","","<p>I have a 2001 Chevy Malibu and have replaced the engine coolant in it twice in the last six months after the low coolant warning light came on, and the light has recently come on again.  The climate is mild here so there's no risk of freezing, and I do keep an eye on the temperature gauge - it doesn't seem to go very far above 180 degrees F in steady-state, which is about 10 degrees above where it sits with full coolant.</p>

<p>Is it safe to continue driving with low coolant as long as I continue to watch the temperature gauge?  If not, what are the potential risks involved?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>About a week or so after my original post, I decided to refill the coolant reservoir yet again and hope for the best.  Not 48 hours later, I was on my way up a hill and suddenly the temperature gauge spiked up to the red line.  I immediately stopped driving and had my car towed to the nearest repair shop.  Turns out the intake manifold gasket had failed which was causing the leak. Fortunately there was no damage to the engine, but unfortunately the manifold is apparently very inaccessible in the 2001 Malibu, requiring more time to replace it.  $1600 and 24 hours later (which included a coolant flush and two oil changes, the first of which was to clear out coolant contamination), my car was running fine.</p>
","<p>""Is it safe to continue driving with low coolant as long as I continue to watch the temperature gauge? ""</p>

<p>No, the temp sensor reads coolant temperature, if the coolant gets low enough to be below the temp sensor, now the sensor is reading metal temperature of the area it is screwed into (usually cylinder head), by the time it reads too hot on the gauge the motor is toast.</p>

","<p>An engine flush is basically the process in which a mechanic puts chemicals in the engine oil to break down sludge or carbon deposits from old oil.

"Using a car with an inaccessible negative battery terminal to jump start","49765","","<p>When trying to jump start my Volvo XC-60, I came across a very unexpected problem.</p>

<p>I tried to use our 2nd vehicle, a 2010 Ford Escape, as the assisting car to jump start mine.  But when I looked at the engine compartment of the Escape, I found that the battery is positioned in such a way that the negative terminal is completely inaccessible and there is no physical method that I can find to connect jumper leads to that battery.</p>

<p>I was always taught to connect the jumper cables as follows:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hiuSC.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>With + to +, and - on the assisting vehicle to a good ground point on the car with the dead battery.</p>

<p>But given that the negative terminal is not accessible, I did not want to try it.  I eventually borrowed a friends car to jump start mine, but now I'm left wondering, is it possible to use the Ford Escape to jump start another car by hooking the negative lead to another location?</p>
","<p>Any ground (earth) location will work. On my '06 Silverado, there are places to hook the jumpers which are away from the battery. You don't even hook the jumpers to the battery no matter which way you're going (whether jumping or being jumped). As long as you have a good ground location, you're golden. Given two vehicles with alternative connection points (places away from the battery), you could possibly have all four locations away from the battery and still be good. This may not be ideal, but it will still work.</p>

<p>As an aside, I was always taught the vehicle doing the jumping should be the last vehicle to be connected, and that the negative on <em>it</em> should be the one which is connected away from the battery. Either way you go, the one which is done last should be the one connected away from the battery. This is because when the last connection is made, the inevitable spark will occur. Batteries release hydrogen gas which can ignite from the spark. By placing the last connection away from the battery, you severely limit the chances of an accidental explosion (think of flames and battery acid going everywhere ... not a pretty thought).</p>

As with any stuck bolt, a short, sharp shock (e.g. kicking the end of the bar with your boot) is usually better than prolonged torque, which tends to be the cause of stripped heads. Once you've got it out, replace with a new, undamaged plug (and new crush washer).</p>

"Rough Low Idle and Engine Shakes, Hesitation and Lack of Power","47358","","<p>On a 98 Mazda 626 GF 2L I'm working on the engine seems to shake / wobble for about a second / second and a half when going to WOT from any starting rpm.  It also almost sounded like maybe one of the belts was even momentarily slipping.  If I accelerate gently everything is smooth and there is no shake or wobble.  It's an automatic and I did this all in park.  Not sure if this is related or not, but the idle seems to be low and a bit shaky / erratic.  Adjusting the idle air screw doesn't seem to have much effect one way or the other.</p>

<p>I'm assuming this to be abnormal, as I don't experience any shake going to WOT on my other car, a 99 Almera which also has a low occasionally erratic idle and even stalls a few times a day ( haven't had time to work on it yet ).</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>So I just did a cigar smoke test, and I noticed that smoke looked like it was coming out the number three injector.  On closer inspection, it looks like the smoke was coming out where the grommet holds the injector in to the manifold.  I also noticed what looks like a dark stain around one side of the grommet ( I shined a light on it and it's definitely not a shadow ):</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WCWmU.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WCWmU.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>If smoke can get out at the injector grommet, I'm assuming air can get in.</p>

<p>I also took out the number three plug, and upon close inspection one side of the plug seemed to have a yellowish hue to it.</p>

<p>Could this be the source of my low rough idle and the shaking / wobbling when pressing down hard on the gas?  Maybe the excess air is causing that cylinder to run lean and hot, and causing the yellowish tint on the plug?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p><strong>So I got a scan tool. Yippie!</strong>  I fixed the small air leak from the #3 lower injector seal, and couldn't see any other air leaks ( doesn't necessarily mean there aren't ), but still have the same problem.  I reset the ECU and logged a 16 minutes drive.  During idle and cruise STFT stayed at zero, but during moderate or heavy acceleration ( <em>which is mushy at first, then solidifies after a second or two</em> ) I see STFT go around 9% - 14% then return to zero at cruise or light acceleration.  Engine load seems to be over 60% during these injection spurts.  The engine seems smooth at higher rpm while cruising.  LTFT stayed at zero the whole time.</p>

<p>At the end of the drive I ran the car's internal ""Key On Engine Running"" self test which didn't show any errors</p>

<p>The 98 US WSM lists the following possible causes for ""<em>Idle speed too low and excessive engine shake</em>"":</p>

<pre><code>• Air leak from intake air system parts
• Spark leak from hightension leads
• Improper operation of IAC valve
• Erratic or no signal from camshaft position (CMP) sensor

","<p>So I finally figured out the problem.  </p>

<p>First off <a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/q/22686/7132"">I had a defective O2 / Lambda sensor, which I replaced</a>.  However, this had little or no noticeable effect on the problem.  The valve cover gasket was completely shot, with oil constantly coming out and also leaking into the spark plug holes.  I fixed the gasket, which also didn't solve the problem.  However, I read a post ( which I can't find at the moment ) in which someone was suffering the same symptoms and also had oil leaking into the plug holes. He changed the gasket and the plugs, wires and coil which solved his problem.  So I took a known good plug and used it to do a spark test.  I saw I had good spark at each wire, but decided to change the plugs since the insulators looked a bit burnt, hoping that would help.  Well, it did!  </p>

<p>I had actually asked about the plugs previously, but everyone said they looked fine, so I went on a wild goose chase checking a million different things.</p>

<p>I'll try and follow with a more detailed answer later.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT March 20th, 2016</strong></p>

<p>This has eliminated about 80% of the problem, but after driving around for a while I realized that the problem is still there, just at a greatly reduced intensity, including both the hesitation and the rough idle.  The replacement plugs I used are NGK G-Power plugs with a fine tip, which according what I've read in various places: ""<a href=""http://www.sparkplugs.co.uk/iridium-spark-plugs"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a much lower voltage is required to jump the spark gap</a>"".  </p>

<p>If this is true, it makes me suspect that the great reduction in hesitation and wobble when revving the engine may be due to the lower voltage requirement, indicating that the coil pack is getting weak.  I've attempted to test this theory by using a adjustable gap spark tester, however my results have been inconclusive since I don't know <a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/27320/what-is-the-output-voltage-for-the-mazda-626-gf-2l-98-2002-coil-pack?lq=1"">what voltage I should be testing</a>, and <a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/q/27366/7132"">what the resultant spark should look like</a>.  </p>

<p><strong>EDIT Nov. 25th 2016</strong></p>

<p>Thanks to a comment by @FredWilson on a different question <a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/38523/what-could-cause-flash-over-arcing-to-reappear-on-new-plugs"">about recurring arcing</a> it became clear that when there is arcing on a plug, there is usually also a carbon trail on the inside of the plug boot:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/otYGM.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/otYGM.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>So I pulled out all the plugs, and cleaned the porcelain sections and the plug boots with IPA and 320 grit sand paper to remove the carbon trails, then I slathered some 3M Silicone Paste ( dielectric grease ) on the porcelain part of the plugs and dabbed a little into the boots.  </p>

<p>So far so good, the hesitation is gone and the increase in power is noticeable.  It seems to have helped somewhat with the idle as well, although that's really a separate and intermittent problem, which I suspect is due to either clogged / leaky injectors or a wonky fuel pressure regulator.</p>

<p>In a moment of stupidity, I opened my radiator cap instead of my oil cap while topping up my engine oil, and poured about 50-100 mls of engine oil into my radiator.</p>

<p>What implications is this likely to have on the car?</p>
","<p>Normally, I would ask first in a comment but that seems to be a privilege not available to new users, so here goes:</p>

<p>Are you sure it was the radiator cap and not the overflow bottle? The radiator is usually full and getting 100ml in would be a struggle, not to mention that the green coolant would be staring you in the face. If you radiator wasn't full then you either have an empty overflow bottle, or your system wasn't burped properly the last time the coolant was changed, or you have a leaking head gasket introducing combustion gasses into your coolant system. </p>

<p>If it was the overflow bottle, there's a good chance that you car hasn't drawn the oil in from the overflow bottle yet. I say this because the pickup for the overflow bottle is near the bottom of the tank, engine oil floats on water and is insoluble in water.</p>

<p>My advice then is to remove the overflow bottle, clean it with a degreaser and refill with coolant. If you did actually get it in the radiator, let me know and I'll edit this answer.</p>

<p>As far as implications of oil in the radiator go: Oil will, in theory, attack the hoses and water pump seals. This would probably be a long term degradation rather than a sudden failure, and given the oil problem I doubt your engine will survive long enough to see the long term effects. My father's vehicle has been running with a slight oil-to-coolant leak for about two years, without any (visible) ill effects. The vast majority of the oil (after you've removed the head of oil floating in the radiator filler) will collect under the radiator cap as a creamy goo, which you can periodically remove. </p>

<p>Replacing the coolant wont do much to remove the oil that has coated the inner surfaces of your cooling system. If you have oil in the radiator and haven't run the car yet, siphon out the oil before it touches any more surfaces in the cooling system.</p>

","<p>It sounds like the clutch is worn out...

"Automatic Transmission - Shifting from Neutral to Drive while in motion","46017","","<p>Recently, I've developed the habit of using the neutral gear in my automatic Honda Fit when going down slight inclines where I would otherwise have to use the accelerator to maintain speed. I understand that shifting into neutral while moving has no detrimental effects on the transmission and engine directly, however, I also shift back into drive sometimes while the car is still moving - I try to match RPMs as best I can guess before moving it back into drive. The questions I have are:
Is shifting back into drive while moving harmful to the engine or transmission? And if so, can RPM matching mitigate effects? Or should I simply stop doing this all together?</p>
","<p>This is a bad idea for several reasons. First, you run the risk of a runaway car. Second, you risk damaging your transmission, which could cause the runaway car in the first place. Thirdly, in newer fuel injected cars, you can actually get worse gas mileage. Let me explain.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>As stated before, by not having it in gear, you run the risk of your car getting away from you. You might have to entirely rely on your brakes to slow your vehicle down. While this may not seem like a very likely thing, using your brakes too much down hill will cause extreme heat to build which could cause a reduction in brake effectiveness, which might not allow you to slow your vehicle after a point. Using your engine/transmission as an engine brake will alleviate some of the creation of some of this heat, which will allow your brakes to work more efficiently when needed.</p></li>
<li><p>After running downhill without your transmission in gear, you put it back into gear. By dropping it into gear at speed, you are putting a lot of stress onto your transmission as it is forced to bring the torque converter and engine up to speed quickly. Transmissions are only made to withstand so much torque before they fail. Even if you don't exceed this theoretical maximum, you are still dropping a great deal of torque back through the transmission. This has an accumulating effect. Noted race car driver/designer, Carrol Smith, wrote a book called <em>Engineer to Win</em>. Chapter seven is entitled, ""Metal Fatigue - or Why Things Break"". It reads: <code>""... under repeated (cyclic as opposed to continuous) stress, the capacity of a metal to withstand stress gradually diminishes and, in most cases, cannot be restored. Metals which are subjected to fluctuating loads can and do break after a finite number of load cycles (or, more accurately, stress cycles) in which the loads applied and the resultant stresses imposed are always below the ultimate strength of the metal. This type of failure is termed 'fatigue failure'.""</code> He states at lower stress levels, things can be made to last indefinitely, but when you start putting those higher loads on the parts, they <em>will</em> break sooner. It is not linear in nature, either, the higher loads you force upon it, the sooner it will happen. By dropping it back into gear from neutral, you are putting these ""higher stress levels"" through the hard parts of your transmission, introducing the stress that would not otherwise be there.</p></li>
<li><p>Within the computer of fuel injected cars, there is a table which is read when the throttle position sensor reads that the throttle is closed (or that the gas pedal is not depressed) and yet the engine is still going at an RPM above idle (this is a simplistic way of looking at it, but basically the way it is). When it reaches this predetermined state, it will drop the injector open time to zero, meaning that no gas will be flowing into the engine. While this period of time is probably not very long, your engine will still use more gas by idling while you have it in neutral than having it in gear and allowing it to attain this state. </p></li>

What is more important is the type of brake pad you purchase to go with your disks.

They will not last as long as you'd like them to and will not give you much more performance than just the slotted ones will.

If it was my car, I wouldn't want to drive it long term without putting the delete pulley on.  I would be worried the belt off situation was a corner case the engineers didn't worry about. </p>

<p>Keep in mind that whatever leaks you have now are possibly going to multiply if you leave the system unpressurized for an extended period.  Also, the compressor is engaged intermittently when you turn on the defroster to dry the air.  If your windshield fogs up it will take longer to clear without the compressor.  </p>

"Why does my 3rd gear grind on shifting when RPMs are high on 2002 Audi TT?","45525","","<p>This only happens when shifting into 3rd gear (on a 7 gear Audi TT).</p>

<p>If I shift when the RPMs are high (say over 2k) then there will be a horrible grinding noise.  Instead I have to apply the clutch, wait until the RPMs come down and then shift.  This problem has gotten increasingly worse over time.</p>
","<p>I assume you mean that the revs are over 2k, if they were over 20k I think you'd get a different sort of noise from the engine bay.</p>

<p>From the description it sounds like you'd got a damaged syncro, especially if this happens when you're shifting down into 3rd. Up shouldn't make quite that bad a noise but if the syncro is really on the way out (which your description suggests it is, given that it's been getting worse over time) you'll get the noise on upshifts, too.</p>

<p>Pretty much the only way to fix it is to pull the gearbox and either replace it with an overhauled one or strip it and replace the syncros. You can also hope that you haven't damaged/worn any gears themselves, that'll make the repair even more expensive. As you can probably guess already, that's not going to be a cheap repair.</p>

<p>In the meantime I would suggest that you double declutch and rev match on downshifts (ie clutch -> box into neutral -> blip throttle -> clutch and move into lower gear) and use slower upshifts to extend the life of the gearbox until you can get it fixed. There's no point in trying to change gears as fast as possible (even on a race track, the gain is minimal) but it's <em>very</em> hard on the box.</p>

","<p><strong>tl dr:</strong> There would be no issues with the running of the vehicle.</p>

<p>If the car in question is equipped with OBDII (or the international like), where the cat is being monitored by a second lambda sensor (O2 sensor), the only side effect of removing the cat would be the check engine light (CEL) would illuminate to show the secondary lambda issue. This would be more of an annoyance than a problem, but it will remain lit all the time. This would preclude you from seeing it light if a real problem occurred. The only way around this would be to put in a replacement for the lambda sensor which would fool the computer into thinking everything was okay (there is a term for these fake sensors, but the name eludes me at present), or to have an aftermarket tune put into the computer, which would set the thresholds for ""out of range"" on the lambda sensor so the CEL would never illuminate. </p>

"Is it possible for a car to start and run with a dead/dying fuel pump?

However, the problem is still the same: My car won't start, and I don't hear the fuel pump coming on. </p>

<p>This started one day when I ran out of gas (floating needle, tried to stretch it), after refilling with over 3 gallons it still won't start. Now I'm thinking the fuel pump was probably on it's way out for a while, and the problem didn't really surface until the tank and lines ran empty. Could this be the case? 2001 Buick Regal FYI.</p>

<hr>

<h2><strong>Update 20140120</strong></h2>

<p>Just an update, I swapped out the pump some months back and it resolved the issue.</p>
","<p>Very possible. Letting a fuel pump run dry can quickly burn out the motor in the pump. The presence of fluid keeps the impeller from rotating as quickly and the gasoline also cools the pump as it operates. Without gas flowing through it can quickly overheat.</p>

<p>That being said however you may just have air in the lines. I am not sure whether your vehicle has a returnless or return style fuel system but make sure you cycle the key into on position atleast three times letting it stay in the on position for at least 5 seconds each time. This should allow your pump (if it is working) to prime the fuel system and bleed out any air.</p>

<p>A returnless system might have more trouble getting air out than a return style but I think your's would be a return style anyway.</p>

<p>Also if you wanted to check if your fuel pump is still working maybe go take the engine side of the fuel filter out slide a vacuum hose or similar over the quick connect tube (leave the fuel pump side plugged in) then put the vacuum hose into a container, and put the car to the on position. You should see gas fly out of the hose and into the container. If it doesn't or is slow replace the pump.</p>

<p>If it does come out at a decent pace you may have to check the pressure.</p>

"Driving on a tire with different aspect ratio number than recommended?","44122","","<p>I have a 2012 VW Passat SEL. Currently I have Han Hankook tires 215/55R17 on them. I am looking to get a full size spare tire and am looking on Craigslist for a cheap alternative. What will be the effect of driving on a 215/47R17.</p>

<p>I found this <a href=""http://www.discounttire.com/dtcs/infoSidewall.do"" rel=""nofollow"">link</a> explaining what is the 65-45 as the aspect ratio, but what will happen if I drive on a higher or lower aspect ratio number? Can I drive on a higher/lower? If yes, how far high/low can I go with?</p>
","<p>If the tire were to be used on the rear of the car, the worst that would happen is the ABS light would come on (and possibly the low tire indicator, if so equipped). If it were on the front end (since the Passat is a front wheel drive vehicle), you run the risk of damaging the transaxle (the <em>differential</em> in the transaxle to be specific). When running tires of different sizes on the drive axle, you are forcing the transaxle to behave as if it is constantly going around a corner. This creates a lot of wear on limited slip parts as well as creates a lot of heat. Since it is collocated with the transmission itself, the added heat creates an issue for the transmission portion of the transaxle as well. Heat is the biggest killer of automatic transmissions.</p>

<p>The difference between the two tires you mention is somewhere to this difference:</p>

<ul>
<li>217/45R17 = 24.6"" overall diameter = 77.3"" circumference </li>
<li>217/65R17 = 28.0"" overall diameter = 87.9"" circumference</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note this is over 10"" difference in circumference ... that isn't just a little difference, that's a <strong><em>HUGE</em></strong> difference. If you'd like to play around with how this all figures out, please <a href=""http://tire-size-conversion.com/tire-size-calculator/"">take a look at this site</a>. Remember, though, this is just a rough estimate as while the numbers look the same, it doesn't mean that one manufacturer's claim to width or aspect ratio is going to be exactly the same as another's. </p>

<p>I have two suggestions for you. First, continue to look on Criagslist. You'll find what you are looking for there. It doesn't sound like you are in a huge hurry to get this done (you don't need it today), so be patient and get what you need. Secondly, see if there is a used tire store around which might have a tire for your vehicle. At least in my area, there are several which charge a set amount for the tire and for mounting/balancing and are very reasonable. </p>

"DIY - How to create a car paint booth? What's Involved?","43761","","<p>Thinking about painting my next project car, and came across a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pz-CB30Ucdo"" rel=""nofollow"">YouTube video</a> where the OP built a makeshift booth in what appeared to be his garage.</p>

<p>Fast forwarding to later videos when he brought the car into the sun, it turned out fairly well, minus some errors that looked like they were probably from his technique.</p>

<p>So, I turn to the experts and ask: What's involved in creating a home paint booth? Assuming small to moderate budget. Is it even necessary? Is the overall goal to eliminate dust and fumes from the area, and contain paint? From research, here's what I've seen so far:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><em><strong>An area big enough for the vehicle and the painter to comfortably walk around the vehicle, and reach the top of the vehicle to paint.</em></strong> This probably goes without saying, but we have to start somewhere. In the video I saw the OP just framed an area with 2x4's and other basic lumber.</p></li>
<li><p><em><strong>A dust free area</em></strong>. I know from vocational school dust and car paint don't mix. In the video, the booth frame was covered with painter's plastic, and held down to the studs and floor with staples and spray adhesive, it seemed to do the job. I would probably use the automotive painter's plastic, where the paint sticks to one side.</p></li>
<li><p><em><strong>Adequate ventilation/Negative Air Pressure</em></strong>. I figured that ventilation would be so that fumes wouldn't build up in the booth, but I'm not sure about the Negative Air Pressure that I've seen used in a couple of videos. In the video referenced above, the OP used a negative air pressure machine, in another video I saw the OP just stuck a fan in the Window, which served the same purpose. </p></li>
<li><p><em><strong>Air filtration</em></strong>. I have to assume that if a fan or neg. air pressure system is blowing air <em>out of</em> the booth while one is working, then that air <em>should</em> (must?) be filtered to remove the isocyanates. The incoming air should be filtered as well to remove any potential dust, correct? How would one filter out the isocyanates from outgoing air? Is it enough to use HEPA 10 furnace filter? Somehow I don't think so. I've only seen isocyanate filters in a small size, to fit in face masks. Do they make them any bigger? If not, one would have to fashion a decent size frame to hold multiple cartridges, a big enough size to match the air flow of volume of air being pulled out of the booth.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This didn't include tools such as an air compressor, sprayer, positive pressure face mask, etc. just the booth, </p>
","<p>You're off to a good start - research, research, research.</p>

<p>1.) I would add; being able to lift the car off the ground, and having movable platforms - to keep your work at a comfortable level, as much as possible. The more light you can get on the job, the better - however, it would be safer to have the fixtures outside the plastic/paint area. Just like all of those warnings about natural gas - even static electricity can cause an explosion in a diy booth. Luck is not your friend and has no business in an enclosed space, with atomized paint.</p>

<p>2.) Most of the dust that you will encounter while painting, is already on the surface to be painted and/or the floor beneath you, and walls around you. Often times painting outside can produce less contamination to the paint, than a diy plastic booth, just from all the ""air leaks"" funneling the dust into your work area. Sanding your job in the same area that you paint, can also make dirt management difficult - so making sure that your work area is just as clean as your work, is a top priority.</p>

<p>3.) One important job of negative pressure systems, is to get the over-spray flowing in the same direction - away from the car. Most often it's a downdraft setup, with intakes in the ceiling, and exhaust in the floor and/or along the walls. These go hand-in-hand with fresh air respirators, to ensure that your atomized pattern is the only thing hitting your work, and good clean air is all that you are breathing.</p>

<p>4.) Air filtration will probably be the most difficult to manage, with the possibility of becoming even more dangerous, the more you try. Outside of professional equipment designed for the job - good, clean air, that is safe for you, as well as anyone or anything that may be in the vicinity of your booth, will be the biggest job ahead of you. While sticking a fan in a window and/or taping a few furnace filters together may sound ideal, they can also be extremely dangerous, and maybe even an illegal compromise, given the location.</p>

<p>There is probably a lot more that can be said, and I'm sure there will be, but first and foremost - do your homework and be safe.</p>

<p>When I built my booth - it was an entirely independent structure, sharing only the floor, of my 30 x 40 garage. With nothing in the booth, but me, my work, my paint gun, and enough hose to circle a car twice. All lighting and air management was completely independent of one another, explosion proof, and adhered to my local codes, to the letter, and then some. And I still felt safer at my employers, in a purpose built booth, that cost tens of thousands of dollars more.</p>

"What are the differences between a wet motorcycle clutch and a dry motorcycle clutch?","43422","","<p>What are the differences between a wet motorcycle clutch and a dry motorcycle clutch?</p>

<p>More specifically, what are the differences in</p>

<ul>
<li>applications</li>
<li>performance</li>
<li>reliability</li>
<li>maintenance/repair</li>
</ul>
","<p>I pulled the following information from <a href=""http://motorcycleinfo.org/2009/12/wet-clutch-dry-clutch/"">this site</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unless you are a professional motorcycle mechanic, you normally can not see whether a motorcycle has a wet or dry clutch just by looking at the bike. But if you know your Italian motorcycles, you probably have a pretty good idea which ones do.</p>
  
  <p>A wet clutch is called wet because it is actually wet with engine oil.  The engine oil provides cooling as well as lubrication between the clutch cage and mating parts.  Generally, a wet clutch will have a longer life and will take more abuse from the rider.  For a beginning rider practicing to get a motorcycle license, a motorcycle that has a wet clutch would be a good choice.</p>
  
  <p>Motorcycle engine oil required for most wet clutch type motorcycles normally is more advanced than standard engine oil.  The oil is typically formulated so it will last longer (retain it’s viscosity) and perform better with a wet clutch, since the wet clutch also adds to the heat and shear that oil has to fight against.</p>
  
  <p>A dry clutch does not live in an oil bath, and is simply dry.  Since a wet clutch generally lives longer, then why would anyone want a motorcycle that has a dry clutch?  One advantage is that a dry clutch does not contaminate the engine oil with the particles that come from normal clutch wear and tear.  If you remove the cover from a dry clutch, you will find dust.  In a wet clutch design, that dust would essentially get worked into the engine oil and collected by the oil filter.</p>
  
  <p>A dry clutch does not contribute to oil breakdown, so you don’t normally need to buy the fancier, and typically much more expensive, type of motorcycle engine oil.   These types of specialized motorcycle oils normally cost roughly 3X the amount of normal oil.</p>
  
  <p>Since it is not spun through the engine oil, another advantage of a dry clutch is that it causes less drag on the engine and therefore robs less power than a wet clutch does.</p>
  
  <p>Italian motorcycles, such as Ducati and Moto Guzzi, have had a long history of having dry clutches.  BMW has used dry clutches as well.  By listening carefully, sometimes you can actually hear if a motorcycle has a dry clutch because a dry clutch often will rattle a little as long as the clutch  lever is held in while the engine is running.  This does not necessarily mean that there is anything wrong with the clutch at all, and in fact, this is like music to some motorcycle racing and sport bike enthusiasts.</p>

At $200 ea, I'd like to replace only a pair of tires, which I'd mount on the front of the vehicle where the wear occurs more quickly.</p>

<p>A TireRack salesman said that some AWD vehicles have a tolerance of 2-3/32"" tread difference between axles to avoid damage to the transfer case (his term, i'd call the component in question a center differential), and that I should check with VW before buying the new tires.</p>

<p>VW customer care gave the answer that as long as the two tires new tires are either both on the front or both on the rear, that it's OK. In other words, there's no tolerance limit. I find this somewhat hard to believe. A VW dealer I called gave the off-hand answer of 6/32"".</p>

<p>Would having tires of different size on the front and rear axles put extra stress on the center differential of an all wheel drive car?</p>
","<p>""It depends""...  I've historically opted to replace all 4 just to be safe (on my AWD with 3 LSD beast, on the RWD open diff I replace 1 at a time if needed :-) ).  In theory a small difference won't blow up the transfer case or the diffs (there's always at least a TINY difference anyways).  Normal wear with a normal rotation obviously doesn't violate the limit, but 2 brand new tires with 2 at the wear bars supposedly does.  Where exactly the line between ""safe"" and ""unsafe"" is, I have no idea.  Actually, it's probably more of a gray area based on heat buildup...</p>

","<p>Getting rid of those deposits is tedious but not difficult:</p>

<li>Fill the cooling system with about two cups of liquid dishwasher detergent dissolved in hot water.</li>
<li>Start the engine and run it until it warms up to regular operating temperature. </li>
<li>Drain the detergent solution and flush with tap water again until it runs clean.  (The idea here is to remove all oils from the system.)</li>
<li>Fill the cooling system with two pounds of citric acid powder (available from industrial chemical supply houses, or from Mercedes-Benz dealers at a considerable premium) dissolved in hot <em>distilled</em> water (since your tap water is hard).</li>
<li>Again, start the engine and run it until it warms up to regular operating temperature, or at least fifteen minutes.</li>
<li>Flush with distilled water.  At this point you should see all sorts of rust, mineral deposits, and miscellaneous crud loosened by the citric acid come out of the drain hole.</li>
<li>Refill the system with the appropriate mix of coolant and distilled water.  Use a modern ""long-life"" orange coolant if you have an aluminum cylinder head, block, or both--green coolant promotes corrosion in aluminum.</li>

"Engine Size and Fuel Consumption","42083","","<p>I have this weird misconception that the engine size is related to the amount of fuel being burned in one cycle(4-stroke engine). I know this is stupid but how does engine size relate to the amount of fuel being burned in one cycle. For example I drive a Ford Ka with a:
1.3i Endura-E engine OHV 1.3 L I4. So I thought that in one cycle 1.3L of fuel is burned, but this is not the case so can someone please explain how they are related. </p>
","<p>With regular driving the Air/Fuel ratio is kept constant at 14.7:1. So if a larger engine needs more air (more swept volume) per cycle then yes it will require more fuel.</p>

<p>So the question boils down to which engine has more friction per cycle, and which car has more weight to carry around. The friction is measured in <a href=""http://hpwizard.com/fmep.html"">FMEP</a> (friction mean effective pressure) which gives you the pressure required in the pistons to keep the engine spinning at a constant rate. FMEP times volume = Power per cycle needed to fight friction. </p>

<p>Note that most of the mechanical losses come from the friction between the piston and the bore. The more pistons you have (V6 vs. I4) the more friction you will have. Note that the #of camshafts, #of valves and #of journal bearings also affect friction.</p>

<p>If those items dont restore power, there is a good chance your motor's compression is low - and you need to rebuild it. That could be anything from new gaskets to needing machine work done.</p>

"'Check Engine' code P0171 System Too Lean - Is it safe to drive?","41650","","<p>My 2003 Toyota Corolla's Check Engine Light came on. I read the codes using an OBD code reader and got <code>P0171 - System Too Lean (Bank 1)</code> and <code>P0133 - 02 Circuit Slow Response (Bank 1, Sensor 1)</code>. The light is on solid, not blinking.</p>

<p>From what I can research online this seems like the most probable causes are the <a href=""http://toyota-solutions.blogspot.ca/2011/02/got-p0171-blues-in-your-toyota-corolla.html"" rel=""nofollow"">intake gaskets needing to be replaced</a> or needing a new Mass Airflow Sensor. Though I haven't done any smoke diagnostics so I can't rule out another cause.</p>

<p>My question is: <strong>is it okay to drive my car while it shows these codes?</strong> I don't want to do permanent damage running too lean. If I drive to the mechanic's or to pick up parts will this cause issues? Or should I get it towed?</p>
","<p>This should not cause you an issue, but this sounds more like a problem with the O2 sensors than with the intake gaskets. When was the last time you had them changed? If you are over 100k miles without new ones, I'd highly suggest this first. </p>

<p>One way to check your theory for the intake gasket is by using a spray bottle with water (on jet, not spray). With the engine running at normal operating temps, spray the area of the intake manifold gasket. You are wanting to hear a change in tone of how the engine is running. When you find a hole (or leaking area), there will be a distinct difference in how the engine runs. The O2 response being slow is what is inclining me to think of this. As O2 sensors get older, the don't normally go <strong><em>bad</em></strong> per-se, but rather they get lazy. They will continue to get more lazy as time goes on. This will cause you to get increasingly worse fuel mileage. </p>

<p>Other things you can do is to ensure you do not have any leaks in your intake tract after the Mass Airflow Sensor. This could be anywhere between it and the head, where the air/fuel enters the cylinder head. Check all vacuum lines/hoses attached to the intake manifold for cracking or breakage. Check to ensure the intake tract is firmly and correctly attached to the throttle body. </p>

<p>As I said, running this to the store to pick up parts will not cause you issue, but get this fixed as soon as possible, you darn sure aren't helping your engine any. </p>

"What is a suitable air compressor for a home garage?","41489","","<p>What type and size air compressor (HP, Tank Size, CFM, direct drive/2 stage... etc) would be suitable for a home garage where I'm going to do small amounts of maintenance but nothing major?<br>
So I would need to be able to use a tyre inflator and a impact wrench, I'd like to be able to do small amounts of spray painting but I don't plan to respray an entire car.</p>

<p>(I'm not asking about specific brands or a models, I want more general info than that)</p>
","<p>I would suggest looking at the tools you plan to purchase for use with the compressor.</p>

<p>Air tools will list what CFM @ X PSI they need to operate.</p>

<p>That is the most important number, to make sure it can supply the air flow your tools need to run.</p>

<p>Beyond that, horsepower and tank size are going to be how much money you are willing to spend.</p>

<p>A larger tank will be able to supply air for longer, higher horsepower will be able to fill a tank faster.</p>

<p>Horsepower typically goes up with tank size otherwise the fill times would get severely long but check the ratios of Power to Size.  For example I've seen a 2.5HP 8 gallon and a 2.5HP 10 gallon in the same product line.  So in that case, the 8 gallon can fill faster and was actually rated to provide higher CFM.</p>

<p>Inflating tires, pretty much any compressor can do.</p>

<p>Impact Wrench (guessing that is what you mean be Rattle Gun) I've seen call for 3-8 CFM @ 90 PSI depending on drive size, torque rating and manufacturer.</p>

<p>Air Ratchets, I've seen 3-5 CFM @ 90 PSI.</p>

<p>The tools that really eat up your air supply are the ones that you keep on for longer periods of time such as grinders and cut off tools.  An impact wrench should do its job with a couple quick pulls of the trigger whereas a grinder you can have on for several minutes at a time when you are working on a piece.</p>

"What does it mean when soot is coming out of my exhaust?","41451","","<p>I have a 2001 Jetta Wagon (Golf Variant is caller in my country). 
Petrol engine. 
Usually rides school and back (15 miles) with engine between 2000 and 3000 rpm. 
Just did a 300 mile trip at 3500-4000rpm. Next morning I noticed smoke and dark water coming out of the exhaust. 
Coolant is not dirty, smoke has decreased after coming back another 300 miles, but when I start the car it ""spits"" black soot/water. </p>

<p>What could be the cause?</p>

<p>I know some water out of the exhaust while it's cold is normal, but in this case, it happens at every start, even with a hot engine, and the soot is considerable. I've just seen a Mazda drip a few drops, which is normal, but if you see the video linked there is a lot of water and soot.</p>

<p>The electronics in the car are not working very well either.</p>

<p>Edit: There is no overheating, No oil in the cooling fluid and no other symptoms.</p>

<p><strong><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpQySxCB1Eg"" rel=""nofollow"">Video of the actual problem</a></strong></p>
","<p>There is nothing wrong, water is a byproduct of gasoline combustion.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2 C8H18 + 25 O2 → 16 CO2 + 18 H2O</p>
</blockquote>

<p>where  C8H18 is the gasoline reacting with oxygen (O2) and giving Carbon-dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) as the byproduct. </p>

<p>So, this simply is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2 * Gas molecules + 25 * Oxygen Molecules → 16 * Carbon Dioxide Molecules + 18 * Water Molecules</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the black soot is just water mixed with carbon in exhaust pipe.</p>

<p>Water usually comes out when engine is not hot enough like when starting it. So the liquid water drips out of exhaust with the carbon mixed in it making it black. But after driving a little the engine becomes hot and so thus the water and it comes out as steam. So you don't need to worry.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT  :</strong> </p>

<p>In some cases the cause of water leaking from exhaust is a blown up head gasket, or cracked head, but that also results in overheating of engine. Since your engine is not overheating so i would say that it's just water getting accumulated in our silencer and coming out when you start the engine.</p>

<p>I can't say much about the electronics, maybe just some wires got loose. You should probably get that checked by someone in the garage.</p>

<p>Hope it helped.</p>

","<p>The most likely cause is the a/c unit. What may have happened is that debris, pine needles,leaves etc may have plugged the drain allowing an excess amount of water to build up and then it relaesed. Run the a/c unit for awhile say 30 minutes. In a safe area like an empty parking lot make some abrubt turns at slow speeds. If you hear water sloshing under the passenger side dash the drain is clogged. If you look under the hood on the passenger side you may see a rubber ""L"" shaped hose. You might be able to clean it out with a small piece of wire.</p>

"Buying new tires R15, R16, R17?","40875","","<p>I currently have 205/55 R16 91V M+S Goodridge tires and an '06 Honda Civic Coupe.  Should I stick with the same type of tires for go for something else? What's the difference between getting R16 or R17? Does it really matter? I realize I don't want anything above R19 on my car because it's going to be too low, but 15,16, or 17? Why would I want any of those sizes? Also, should I change the tires myself or take it somewhere so that they can be aligned etc?</p>
","<p>As pointed out by DXM, the 15,16,17 isn't an interchangeable number.</p>

<p>None of the first 3 numbers can just be changed individually.</p>

<p>With your 205/55R16 example:<br>
205 is the width of the tire in millimeters
55 is the percentage of the width that equals the height of the sidewall (so 205 x .55 = 112.75mm)<br>
16 is the wheel diameter in inches the tire fits on</p>

<p>One wheel can hold a range of widths, so you might be able to go from 205 to 225 to run a wider tire (more rubber on the road, creates a larger contact patch and so theoretically more traction) but you would need to reduce the sidewall percentage to 50 to keep the height of the sidewall close to the same (112.75mm vs 112.5mm).</p>

<p>If you do not keep the overall diameter of your tire the same (wheel diameter + sidewall height) you will be altering your final gear ratio which will make your speedometer incorrect, alter your fuel mileage (better or worse depends on driving behavior and altered size), impacts your acceleration, what speed you can reach in which gears, your effective power band, etc.</p>

<p>Again using the 205/55R16 your current overall diameter is 519.15mm (wheel size * 25.4 + tire width * sidewall percentage)</p>

<p>To move to a 17"" wheel assuming the same wheel and tire width, you'd need to use a 205/45R17 to get close but you'd actually be 4.9mm taller (off by about 1%).  Fitting a 215/40R17 would get you 1.35mm shorter (off by about .25%).</p>

<p>Going with a wider tire and especially a wider wheel you have to take more into account as you may have clearance issues and either need wheels with a different offset or make use of wheel spacers.</p>

<p>There is rarely a perfect match when changing the wheel size but the more you can reduce the variance, the less you will impact items on the car that you shouldn't be changing unless you understand why you are changing them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you receive a customer concern of a “beep- beep-beep” sound when
  trying to operate the PRG, a likely cause is an incomplete
  initialization procedure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Repair Procedure:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>With the ignition “OFF”, open the PRG manually using a fluid motion (no light flash or beep should occur).</li>
  <li>Carefully (slowly) close the rear gate until the first audible “click” of the rear gate latch mechanism is heard then immediately let
  go of the rear gate. The auto closer function will then operate to
  complete the rear gate closing / latching function. This will also
  complete the initialization process. If the auto closer function is
  inoperative, diagnose per the applicable Service Manual.</li>
  <li>After the PRG is fully closed, operate either the Gate Opener switch, the Gate Inner (close) switch, remote keyless access switch or
  the Interior PRG Open/Close switch to verify the automatic opening and
  closing operation.</li>
  <li>If the PRG inoperative condition persists, record the radio station presets (and navigation system favorites, if applicable).</li>
  <li>IMPORTANT: Record any codes currently in PRG memory as the next step will clear them. 6. Disconnect the positive and negative cables
  from the vehicle’s battery, touch the 2 cable ends together creating a
  capacitive discharge which will clear the memory.</li>
  <li>Reconnect the cables to the battery, reset all radio presets (and navigation favorites, if applicable) then confirm normal PRG
  operation. • If the customer’s PRG usage pattern precludes the ability
  of the system to initialize upon closing, and control unit replacement
  is determined to be necessary to assure customer satisfaction, order
  and replace the PRG control unit following the service procedure
  outlined in the applicable Service Manual. • If the PRG still does not
  operate properly, utilize any codes pulled from the system and follow
  the rest of the diagnostic procedures beginning on page PRG(diag)-2 of
  the 2014 Forester Service Manual.</li>

<p>The elevation idea came to me when I noticed that the heater core is placed higher than the radiator cap in the vehicle. So if air were to get itself stuck there then it would be quite the fight to get it open since air will work to the highest point in the system.</p>

<li>If this does not solve the issue, then there is a restriction in the heater core. You could try flushing the heater core yourself or have a reputable shop perform the flush. If flushing doesn't work, then it'll have to be replaced.</li>

<li>Will I need to replace them immediately afterwards, or just when they get thin as usual?</li>
</ol>

<p>I suppose the core of this question is ""After overheating, do brakes cool down to their original state, or do they substantially lose effectiveness?"".</p>
","<p>My experience, limited to a few very specific configurations is:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I've never had rotor warping issues even after a LOT of heat in the brakes (both from track days and also stuck brakes while driving on the express way).  I've used generic NAPA rotors, OEM rotors, and fancy heat/cryo treated ones.  I can't tell any difference between any of them.  They all function like big slabs of metal heatsink.  :-)</p></li>
<li><p>The brake pads themselves (including dirt cheap ones, Carbotechs, and Porterfields) have always worked the same after being very hot as before.  However, the cheap ones and the Carbotechs (Panthers, a fine brake pad overall, but just not up to stopping a car as heavy as mine with such small brakes and so much power) went in the trash the day after the events I used them as they performed so poorly <em>while</em> hot.</p></li>
<li><p><em>If</em> you boil the brake fluid, you should bleed the system as it does seem to lose a little effectiveness (but was nowhere near as bad as I had expected).  Wet boiling point seems to be more important than dry.  I've boiled 2 week old Motul 600, but the off the shelf at the auto store synthetic (with much lower dry boiling point, but higher wet boiling point) is fine in my cars on the track for years.</p></li>
<li><p>A bigger concern is the condition of the caliper seals.  I've melted the seals out of the caliper without hurting the pads, rotors, or boiling the fluid before...  That happened only with cheap pads, better quality pads have backing plates that provide at least some insulation value.  :-)</p></li>

"Why did my clear coat turn out matte instead of glossy, and how can I fix it?","39812","","<p>A while back I fixed up some rust spots on stone kicks on my hood, and ended up repainting my whole hood to cover them up after grinding/puttying/priming.  I got custom matching spray paint made and used that to paint to hood, and then covered it with two coats of clear coat (I used two since the first coat wasn't glossy and thought maybe the second would be).

<p>Yes, the ""color"" coat(s) need to be wet-sanded aka ""color sanded"". And then thoroughly cleaned of sanding dust. This needs to be perfectly smooth before clear, even if it appears dull. The quality of a mirror, for instance, is not as dependent on the glass as much as the overall flatness of the silvering reflective coating or layer. I'm not a body guy, and I learned that expensive and laborious lesson too late from a real pro -- after experiencing much poorer results than the OP. I vowed not to attempt such foolishness again without guidance. Art and experience, not so much science. I was sure clear would make it perfect. It was worse. And black, the trickiest of all. </p>

<p>Silver is also finicky.  One reason is the metal flake to make it silver will lay differently depending on the state of electrostatic charge.  OEMs paint cars with all panels completely electrically grounded to minimize variation.  But there still is some.</p>

<p>Also, there is just no way a Duplicolor rattle can is going to perfectly color match an expensive PPG or BASF (is that a VW?) factory formula at $300 a quart. UV ages paint as well, the color shifts, and the spray can has no way of knowing.   Plus, no OEM uses enamel much anymore... they are much more sophisticated urthethanes and other polymers, which can't be shot out of a rattle can nozzle easily, and also contain isocyanates and other super-nasty solvents too toxic to be deemed available to public retail -- that might spray in their driveway next to the kids and dog without a respirator and a downdraft booth.  (no offense to the OP intended-)</p>

<p>Also also, the OP set himself up with a difficult challenge.  By painting only the hood, his paint job is laid directly adjacent to OEM paint on the flat top part of the fenders.  That makes a very easy instant visual comparison, making the slight difference very obvious.  Even a pro would probably not attempt that... while much more expensive, the fender tops would also be stripped, and the color coat blended to the outside fender edge where it rolls over to vertical.  Any color difference or gloss difference would be obscured as the light angle is different.  To the eyes and brain it would just seem like a shadow and dismissed. Take a look at the two OP results pictures and you'll see instantly what I mean.</p>

<p>And lastly, I honestly think it turned out very well.  My attempt was in a clean, temperature controlled shop environment, with expensive paint, cleaners, and a huge amount of prep work.  And it looked awful.  Because I didn't color sand before clear.</p>

"Why doesn't anyone ever repair an automatic transmission?","39483","","<p>I am old enough to have had about four transmission failures spaced over about 40 years and at no time did any mechanic ever offer to “fix” it; the only diagnosis has been a complete rebuild.</p>

<p>This is not what happens to any other part of the car. There are many potential repairs to the engine. Various individual parts can be replaced and/or repaired and even the engine itself can be tinkered with to an amazing extent without ever costing anywhere close to $2500. I’ve even heard of having engines rebuilt for less than that.</p>

<p>Not transmissions though; only a rebuild. I’ve asked every mechanic I’ve ever used why and I’ve gotten many different answers – they usually involve something about the transmission being so hard to get to that by the time you’ve hoisted the engine out of the way or done whatever else, you’ve spent enough labor to make it feasible to just rebuild the whole thing.  </p>

<p>But this doesn’t really ring true for some reason. I can’t see why a manufacturer can’t design some access into the thing that might allow some service. That last mechanic told me that the case and all the gears inside are all original – they only replaced the parts (clutches) that were worn. Surely some sort of access hole could be a part of the design much like the oil pan underneath the engine. My current vehicle's transmission has no drain plug at all that I can see.</p>
","<p>This is one of those things which are easier said than done. To start with, let me show you a picture of a four speed transmission which has been blown apart:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/cJ8g2.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>All of those hundreds of parts go through the front end of the transmission. If a single part is bad (which it usually is <strong>not</strong> the case), you have to pull all of this apart in order to diagnose and repair. Like the mechanic you talked to said, it doesn't make sense to replace just the part which is bad while you have it all apart. The parts are pretty much the cheap part of the rebuild (or fix). Why not just make it a brand new transmission through the rebuild process. You could replace the single part, at a cost difference of a couple hundred dollars, only to have it go bad again in the not too distant future when another part goes bad which wasn't replaced.</p>

<p>In most cases when a transmission needs repaired, it is one or more of the soft parts which have gone bad. These include the band(s) and clutches. Usually the hard parts, like the gears, do not go bad and are reused after a thorough cleaning and inspection. You also have to consider, the transmission is very susceptible to debris. When these soft part start letting go, it can put a lot of debris through the transmission which the filter cannot keep up with. When the debris starts going around, it will damage other soft parts in the process. Soft parts also tend to wear at about the same pace (within the same group). So, not just one clutch in the clutch pack will go bad, but the entire group of them will go bad. You aren't going to replace just one clutch, you have to replace all of them. One last thing to consider here is that they sell the transmission parts as a kit (with a few exceptions). You aren't just going to buy single parts. By parts in this instance I'm talking about the soft parts ... you can usually buy hard parts separately. </p>

<p>There is no other way, with current transmission design, for you to get at any of the parts inside the transmission ... at least the parts which make the vehicle go. The design as it is, is very compact and does the job very well. If there was any way for a mechanic to be able to get to the parts inside without going the way it does now, it wouldn't have the strength to stay together. Believe me when I say, you could be a rich man to design an automatic transmission to do as you are suggesting and still have it as compact and efficient as what is currently offered. </p>

<p>The reason you don't see a drain plug on most automatic transmission is because when you change the fluid, you also change the filter. The exception to this is when you take it to a shop and get the transmission flushed. When they do this, they force fluid backwards through your transmission using the cooling lines. This (supposedly) cleans the filter in the process as well as completely exchanges the old fluid for new fluid (to include the torque converter - which doesn't happen when you just drop the pan). </p>

<p>The reason for the cost, as you suggested, is because of one, the labor involved in removing the transmission from the car, and two, because not every mechanic can rebuild a transmission. To do it right takes some extra learning. You just cannot throw it together and expect it to work ... and every make/model is different. All of that costs money. Most engines, on the other hand, are pretty much the same (with a few exceptions). They are all pretty much hard parts which go together relatively easy. There are some idiosyncrasies, but for the most part, they're not a big deal.</p>

<p>I hope this gives you a flavor for why you aren't going to see too many shops offering to repair your transmission. Again, as the mechanic said, the major part of any transmission repair is the labor for Removal &amp; Replacement of the transmission itself. </p>

"What are the Advantages & Disadvantages of a Boxer engine?","39340","","<p>I know that boxer engines are those which have pistons moving in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>Also the fact that since they sit low the center of gravity is lower and causes better handling.</p>

<ol>
<li>Why dont mainstream manufactureres use Boxer configuration sans Subaru and the BR-Z cars.(Also not including the VW beetle or the Tata Nano)?</li>
<li>What are the disadvantages?</li>
</ol>
","<p>Like V configuration piston engines , <em>boxer</em> or <em>flat</em> configuration engines can be made approximately half the length of a straight configuration engines. Compared to V engines boxers are not as tall, offering the ability to position mass lower in the vehicle's chassis, but are wider.</p>

<p>All boxer engines feature low primary vibration as pairs of pistons are opposed and move in a way to cancel out each other's momentum.</p>

<p>Like Vs boxers are more complex that straight engines, having 2 cylinder heads with associated head gaskets, exhaust manifolds etc., and double the number of camshafts, more complex camshaft chains or belts and more complex cooling.</p>

<p>Compared to Vs, boxer engines have a more complex crankshaft as they have a crank throw for each connecting rod. True V's have pairs of rods sharing each crank throw.</p>

<p>The probable reason boxer or flat configurations are not used very often in modern cars is because a straight or V engines are almost always a better choice.</p>

<p>Many cars are now front wheel drive which work best with a compact, transversely mounted engine. A straight-4 or a V6 are much more suitable that a flat-4 or flat-6 in this configuration.</p>

<p>Longitudinal mounted engines are preferred for front-engine, rear wheel drive, the boxer engine's lower mass probably does not provide enough advantage over the simpler straight-4 or V6.</p>

<p>Where boxer's really do seem to work is in air-cooled rear-engined  cars (e.g., the VW Type-1 and Porsche 911) where width is less of a concern, the engine must be a short as possible to avoid a large mass behind the rear axle, and the banks of cylinders are easier to cool as they are more widely spaced from each other.</p>

<p>With regards to the modern Subaru layout, which originally featured 4-cylinder engines and all wheel drive, a longitudinal mounted boxer makes sense. To accommodate front wheel drive-shafts the engine must be placed in front of the front axle line, and the short, low boxer engine has advantages. (Compare this with the original all wheel drive Audi 80 Quatro that had a straight-5 hanging way-out ahead of the front axle.)</p>

<p>At one point flat-12 engines were used in racing cars such as the Porsche 917, and many Ferrari F-1 cars (although these were technically 180° V-12s, which may have any cylinder bank angle). Flat-12's proved incompatible with ground-effects as the cylinder heads occupied the space where the venturi tunnels needed to be. </p>

","<p>Let me preface this by you do any of this <strong>at your own (and passenger's if any) risk</strong>. That said, you <em>should</em> be able to drive this the extra 20 miles to get it home. I would drive slowly (back roads, 35mph maximum) if possible. The idea with that is to keep heat in the tire down to a minimum. Also, if it does blow out, you should be able to keep the car under control while you pull it over to the side. I have seen tires in worse shape make it further, but no two tires are the same. </p>

<p>There are two things to think about with your tire here. First, what caused the tire to wear unevenly. Secondly, instead of going home, you should think about taking it to a tire shop to get it replaced. When you get it home as it is, what are you going to have to do then? Take it to a shop to get the tire replaced, but you'll have a bunch more miles on it.</p>

What are some scenarios where the Single Din Audio will prove to be more beneficial?</p>

<p>Appreciate if you can also highlight the very basic differences in the two.
Thanks! </p>
","<p>The only difference between single and double DIN is the size of the unit.</p>

<p>However double DIN units often have added features like touch screens, dvd, and navigation features which require the extra space for mounting. Many double din units will use the same audio processors and DACs that the single din units of the same brand do, so they often have the same sound quality.</p>

<p>Often the advantage of going single DIN is that they are generally cheaper because they don't have the added bells and whistles of touch screens, etc. This means you can spend less money ($200-300) for a unit that has the exact same audio quality as a double din unit that costs $700+. Also a single din unit will fit in more vehicles than a double din.</p>

"Wheel Alignment: Just how bad is bad?","39238","","<p><strong>Context/Information:</strong> If I understand correctly, having a fixed axle in a car makes getting things aligned significantly harder. This seems to be the case in my 2009 Toyota Corolla and the rear axle. When my wife took it to Costco to get new tires, they told her the old front tires had some cupping and the rear set had feathering (don't have more details than that). She took it to get aligned, in order to prevent further unnecessary wear, and was told that the front was already within factory specs, and the rear was not adjustable (though the minor improvements to the front specs threw the rear left toe OUT OF factory specs and the left further out of spec for both toe and camber). The factory tires replaced had about 41,000 miles on them. <strong>The specs for the rear camber and toe are apparently -2.0 to -1.0 degrees and 0.01 to 0.26 degrees, respectively.</strong></p>

<p>Finally, the shop stated <code>The manufacturer does not specify rear CAMBER and TOE adjustments</code>, leading me to believe the rear axle is solid.</p>

<p><strong>-- END EDIT --</strong></p>

<p><strong>Question(s):</strong> How bad is a right toe reading of 0.28 degrees (0.02 above the spec range), a left toe reading of -0.02 degrees (0.03 below), and a left camber reading of -2.1 degrees (0.1 below)? my instinct is that this may reduce the life of the tires only very subtly, and would be mitigated fairly well by rotating tires. Is there a general rule to go by for alignment's affect on wear? How long SHOULD my tires have lasted?</p>
","<p>You basically have 3 measurements in the front, and 2 in the back that are normally adjustable unless you have a solid axle (You don't). The front <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caster_angle"" rel=""nofollow"">caster</a> is adjusted at the strut mount, the front/rear <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camber_angle"" rel=""nofollow"">camber</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toe_%28automotive%29"" rel=""nofollow"">toe</a> normally utilize rods to adjust. The toe utilizes the tie rods in the front that are attached to your steering box, and the rear usually uses a rear tie rod that is set in place. The camber is adjusted using a mounting arm in most cases, and all 5 of these should be available in your vehicle. There are of course other measurements that are looked at to determine whether your vehicle will drive straight or not, but these are the commonly adjustable ones. The numbers you mention seem small, and if the vehicle is not pulling, you should be ok. The most important thing to extend tire life is the pressure, if you let your pressures drop, you will wear the tire out. If they tried to align the vehicle, and it failed, you might need suspension parts at this point (pot holes are rod/arm killers). Most dealerships keep a competitive rate on alignments, so do not be afraid to call and get an alignment quote.</p>

"Lots of sparks and heat when jump starting a car","39084","","<p>I just tried to jump start a friend's car. When I connected the jumper cables, there were a lot of sparks. They were connected for nearly 30 seconds and I noticed a lot of heat and smoke coming from both batteries. I immediately disconnected and didn't try again. I didn't even start the car with the good battery. Why was this, and what can I do to avoid it?</p>
","<p>With the description you give, I'd say you connected them backwards with about a 99%+ assurance. Large amounts of sparks followed by heat are both <em>VERY BAD SIGNS</em> (as you soon figured out) and almost always mean you have the jumpers on backwards. Never trust what the covers on the battery says. <strong>Check what the battery says to be sure.</strong> If there is no way to see what is on the battery (the terminals cover them), follow the cables back to their source. The negative will go to a ground and the positive will go to the starter and to the alternator. If those are correct, ensure that the jumper cables are correctly aligned. Some sets I've seen will have black shielding on both with a thin yellow (or some other color) stripe up them. It would be very easy to mix these up. If you still think it was right, you could ultimately check each side of the jumper cables for continuity to ensure you are matching them up.</p>

  <p>How to Glue a Side View Mirror</p>
  
  <p>By Brenda Priddy</p>
  
  <p>A side view mirror is a necessary piece of equipment on any car. </p>
  
  <p>The side view mirror allows the driver to see behind and to the sides of the car, which prevents accidents while changing lanes. </p>
  
  <p>Side view mirrors must be present and complete to pass a car inspection. When a side view mirror becomes damaged, it is important to replace the mirror right away to prevent accidents. </p>
  
  <p>Replacing a side view mirror is a simple project that anyone can do at home.</p>
  
  <p>Things You'll Need
  Non-latex construction silicone adhesive
  Replacement mirror
  Large, flat head screwdriver
  Heat gun
  Bucket
  Work gloves
  Masking tape
  Safety goggles
  Extension cord (optional)
  Shop rags</p>
  
  <p>Remove the old mirror from the frame. Wear work gloves and safety goggles, when removing the old mirror, for safety. Place a large bucket under the mirror to catch any broken glass pieces.</p>
  
  <p>Connect a heat gun to a nearby electrical outlet. Use an extension cord, if necessary, to reach the outlet and mirror. Heat the surface of the mirror with the heat gun until the surface of the mirror is hot to the touch.</p>
  
  <p>Scrape away the mirror pieces with a large, flat head screwdriver. Try to remove one piece at a time. If the mirror is still in one or two solid pieces, then hit the mirror with the back of the screwdriver to break it into smaller pieces for easier removal. Scrape the pieces out one by one until they are all removed. If necessary, re-heat the surface of the mirror if the adhesive hardens again before all of the pieces were removed.</p>
  
  <p>Clean away any remaining glue by wiping the surface of the mirror with a wet rag. Do not use chemical products on the mirror housing or the adhesive may not stick when you glue the new mirror. Wipe down both sides of the mirror as well.</p>
  
  <p>Apply five beads of silicone to the back of the mirror. Place one bead on each corner and one in the middle. Use a bead about 3/8 of an inch in diameter and apply it ½ inch from each mirror edge.</p>
  
  <p>Press the mirror firmly into the mirror housing for about 30 seconds; however, do not apply too much pressure or the mirror may break again. Wrap the entire mirror housing and mirror with masking tape to hold the mirror in place so it does not fall out before the glue dries. Leave the tape over the mirror for 24 hours before removing.</p>

<p>My question is, is it necessary to instruct the vehicle in some way (disconnecting the battery may be) to start re-learning? Or does it keep relearning always so that it is unnecessary to trigger it?</p>
","<p>I know this vehicle as a Yaris; 1NZ-FE engine, and that is the vehicle I am commenting on.</p>

<p>Toyota does not mention a specific procedure for an idle relearn in their official service information. 
Even the procedure for throttle body replacement does not mention a relearn procedure. The info does not state that a procedure is not needed, it is silent on the subject. Experience has taught that when service info does not mention a relearn the PCM performs this task without intervention. Self learn is normal and has become the routine for most PCM relearns for throttles, crankshafts, camshafts, evaporative purge amounts, individual cylinder fuel control and others. Most of these are done with software based on neural network type algorithms. </p>

<p>For a standard idle relearn with no OEM specified procedure the best method is to drive the vehicle for a time with lots of stop and start cycles. This usually resolves idle irregularities. If not try, the next method.</p>

<p>Professional techs learn some tips and workarounds. One of them is this, to reset a PCM that is not performing as expected remove both battery terminals touch them together for at least thirty seconds. This can, but does not always resolve a problem. It is a last resort procedure because it resets all the memories in every computer in the vehicle so be prepared to reset everything. Make sure to have the radio security code. On a luxury vehicles this often requires owner input to reset owner preferences. </p>

<p>If this does not work seek professional diagnostic help.</p>

<p><strong>Oil</strong></p>

<p>Originally there was <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum"">crude oil</a>. Black gold. Texas Tea. As crude oil, it is fairly much useless. It's the distillates which make up the usable parts. Crude oil is refined down to create lubricants and fuels through many different methods. This mainly happens by heating it and breaking it down into its usable components. Chemical engineers then take the oil and make it better. They will throw in additives to help it work better, to clean, and other such things we require of it. This type of oil is called regular oil or even ""dino oil"" (considering oil is considered to have originated from decomposing plants and animals which originated during the time of <em>dino</em>saurs). When you look at a dino oil, it is not very consistent. When you consider an oil grade for dino oils, think of it as an <em>average</em>. I was once given this visualization of dino oil molecules:</p>

<p>.oOoo..oOOoOo...o.o.</p>

<p><strong>Synthetic Oil</strong></p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_oil"">Synthetic oil</a> is man made. Chemical engineers take base oil stock and chemically modify it to create a lubricant which is more stable than dino oil, where operating extremes (such as high performance autos or jet engines) occur. This oil is tailored to have a controlled molecular structure with predictable properties. There are many different types of synthetic oils, made many different ways. In line with the above visualization of dino oil molecules, synthetic oil molecules might look more like this:</p>

<p>ooooooooooooooooo</p>

<p>To this end, there are three different categories of oil products:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Organic oil</strong> - Dino oil. Regular oil. Crude oil which has been boiled.</li>
<li><strong>Semi-Synthetic</strong> - A mix of dino oil and synthetic oil. Can also be called <em>synthetic blend</em> or <em>semi-synthetic</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Synthetic</strong> - Pure man-made oil (no dino oil added).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Oil Standards</strong></p>

<p>There are several standards in the world which pertain to oil. Some of those standards are from the:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.sae.org/"">Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE)</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://www.acea.be/"">European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA)</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://www.api.org/"">American Petroleum Institute (API)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>(NOTE: These are some main ones, but there are others). To better understand what each organization's, let's break some things down for you.</p>

<p>Each organization has a different indicator for their oil specification. Here are the indicators for each of the three major organizations:</p>

<ul>
<li>SAE - 0W, 5W, 10W, 20W, 25w, 16**, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 (NOTE: ** New SAE Standard)</li>
<li>ACEA - A1/B1, A3/B3, A3/B4, A5/B5, C1, C2, C3, C4, E4, E6, E7, D9</li>
<li>API - SN, SM, SL, SJ, SH, SG, SF, SE, SD, SC, SB, SA, CJ-4, CI-4 Plus, CI-4, CH-4, CG-4, CF-2, CF, CF-4, CE, CD-II, CD, CC, CB, CA</li>
</ul>

<p>This is called the API Donut. It has two of these three service ratings listed in them and also tells whether an oil is considered ""Energy Conserving"":</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XXduY.jpg"" alt=""API Dount""></p>

<p><strong>NOTE1:</strong> These standards can best be understood by reading through the standards body write-ups, but I will try to give a brief overview of what is important, as well as some charts which will describe them a little better than I can with a wall-of-words in this article. </p>

<p><strong>NOTE2:</strong> This write-up is for motor oil. Do not confuse this with how gear or other oil is labeled, because it has a completely different standard, though some of the markings appear in the same configuration.</p>

<p>I'll start with SAE because it is probably the most confusing.</p>

<p><strong>SAE</strong></p>

<p>All of SAE specifications have to do with the viscosity of an oil. The viscosity meaning, <em>what is the specific flow rate, at a specific temperature, through a specific sized orifice</em>. There are two basic types of oil concerned when you are looking at the SAE specification. There is <em>straight weight</em> and <em>multi-viscosity</em>. <strong>Straight weight</strong> oil does not contain modifiers which affect how the oil flows. It is denoted by a single number such as 30. A <strong>multi-viscosity</strong> will have different flow properties depending on the temperature. It is denoted by a hyphenated number, such as 0W-20. </p>

<p><strong>NOTE3:</strong> Do not think of oil viscosity numbers in terms of <em>thicker</em> or <em>thinner</em> ... Flow rate is modified by means other than the how thick or thin it is. </p>

<p>The first number of the two has a ""W"" following it. This indicates the <em>Winter</em> or <strong><em>cold start viscosity</em></strong> of the oil (though some mistakenly think the ""W"" stands for ""weight""). Originally this denoted the viscosity of oil when it is measured at 0degF. In 1999 this was changed due to an outbreak of engine failure due to oil jelling at low temperatures (see chart below for newer standard). The second number denotes the viscosity of the oil when measured at 100degC (or 212degF).</p>

<p>This chart indicates some numbers which may or may not be useful to the average Joe, but are the specification for each of the numbers I've listed (other than 16**):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gIfeL.jpg"" alt=""Viscosity Grade Chart from Speednik.com""></p>

<p>You will notice that the for each of the Winter designations, it is mainly concerned with <em>how well the oil flows at a given minimum temperature</em>. Whereas the straight number has concerns on both the minimum and maximum flow rate of an oil. </p>

<p><strong>NOTE4:</strong> 100degC (or 212degF) is used as a main reference point due to this being the approximate running temperature of an engine. It is an easy reference point to work with.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE5:</strong> Please understand that a 5W-30 and 10W-30 are still 30 grade oils and will still perform the same at a higher given temperature. The difference is their flow rate is different at the lower temperatures. This is achieved through molecular chains which open (become straight) and close (bunch up) at different temperatures. This opening and closing effect changes how the oil flows and thus effectively changes the viscosity without changing the oil grade itself.</p>

<p>Here is a <em>general</em> chart of which oil should be used in which temperature range (though it is my personal belief you should follow what your vehicle manufacturer's recommendation so as to not void warranties, etc):</p>

<p>Some vehicle manufacturers will give you a variance chart in your owner's manual which tells you which weight to use if you sustain higher or lower temperatures during the year.</p>

<p><strong>ACEA</strong></p>

<p>The ACEA is a little easier to figure out than SAE. Their standards are broken down into three main areas: A/B; C; and E.</p>

<p>And finally ...</p>

<p><strong>API</strong></p>

<p>The API has two distinct categories. Those for gasoline engines (<strong>S</strong> designation) and for diesel engines (<strong>C</strong> designation). I am only going to give you the write-ups for those specifications which are current. You can look where <a href=""http://www.oilspecifications.org/api_eolcs.php"">I pulled them from</a> to get the rest if you are so inclined:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>SN</strong> <em>Introduced in October 2010</em> Introduced in October 2010 for 2011 and older vehicles, designed to provide improved high temperature deposit protection for pistons, more stringent sludge control, and seal compatibility. API SN with Resource Conservingmatches ILSAC GF-5 by combining API SN performance with improved fuel economy, turbocharger protection, emission control systemcompatibility, and protection of engines operating on ethanol-containing fuels up to E85.</p>
  
  <p><strong>SM</strong> <em>Introduced on 30 November 2004</em> Category SM oils are designed to provide improved oxidation resistance, improved deposit protection, better wear protection, and better low-temperature performance over the life of the oil. Some SM oils may also meet the latest ILSAC specification and/or qualify as Energy Conserving. They may be used where API Service Category SJ and SL earlier categories are recommended.</p>
  
  <p><strong>SL</strong> <em>2001 Gasoline Engine Service</em> Category SL was adopted to describe engine oils for use in 2001. It is for use in service typical of gasoline engines in present and earlier passenger cars, sports utility vehicles, vans and light trucks operating under vehicle manufacturers recommended maintenance procedures. Oils meeting API SL requirements have been tested according to the American Chemistry Council (ACC) Product Approval Code of Practice and may utilize the API Base Oil Interchange and Viscosity Grade Engine Testing Guidelines. They may be used where API Service Category SJ and earlier categories are recommended.</p>
  
  <p><strong>SJ</strong> <em>1997 Gasoline Engine</em> Service Category SJ was adopted in 1996 to describe engine oil first mandated in 1997. It is for use in service typical of gasoline engines in present and earlier passenger cars, vans, and light trucks operating under manufacturers recommended maintenance procedures. Oils meeting API SH requirements have been tested according to the American Chemistry Council (ACC) Product Approval Code of Practice and may utilize the API Base Oil Interchange and Viscosity Grade Engine Testing Guidelines. They may be used where API Service Category SH and earlier categories are recommended.</p>
  
  <p><strong>CJ-4</strong> <em>Current - 2006</em> Introduced in 2006 for high-speed four-stroke engines. Designed to meet 2007 on-highway exhaust emission standards. CJ-4 oils are compounded for use in all applications with diesel fuels ranging in sulphur content up to 500ppm (0.05% by weight). However, use of these oils with greater than 15ppm sulfur fuel may impact exhaust after treatment system durability and/or oil drain intervals. CJ-4 oils are effective at sustaining emission control system durability where particulate filters and other advanced after treatment systems are used. CJ-4 oils exceed the performance criteria of CF-4, C-4, AH-4 and C-4.</p>
  
  <p><strong>CI-4 Plus</strong> <em>Current - 2004</em> Used in conjunction with API C-4, the "" CI-4 PLUS"" designation identifies oils formulated to provide a higher level of protection against soot-related viscosity increase and viscosity loss due to shear in diesel engines. Like Energy Conserving, CI-4 PLUS appears in the lower portion of the API Service Symbol ""Donut.""</p>
  
  <p><strong>CI-4</strong> <em>Severe-Duty Diesel Engine Service</em> The CI-4 performance requirements describe oils for use in those high speed, four-stroke cycle diesel engines designed to meet 2004 exhaust emission standards, to be implemented October 2002. These oils are compounded for use in all applications with diesel fuels ranging in sulfur content up to 0.05% by weight. These oils are especially effective at sustaining engine durability where Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) and other exhaust emission componentry may be used. Optimum protection is provided for control of corrosive wear tendencies, low and high temperature stability, soot handling properties, piston deposit control, valve train wear, oxidative thickening, foaming and viscosity loss due to shear. CI-4 oils are superior in performance to those meeting API CH-4, CG-4 and CF-4 and can effectively lubricate engines calling for those API Service Categories.</p>
  
  <p><strong>CH-4</strong> <em>Severe-Duty Diesel Engine Service</em> This service oils are suitable for high speed, four-stroke diesel engines designed to meet 1998 exhaust emission standards and are specifically compounded for use with diesel fuels ranging in sulfur content up to 0.5% weight. CH-4 oils are superior in performance to those meeting API CF-4 and API CG-4 and can effectively lubricate engines calling for those API Service Categories.</p>

"How much does displacement affect performance?","38558","","<p>I'm interested in learning more about the steps that can be taken to increase the performance of an engine. I'm curious how much displacement affects performance. For example, compare the following two engines:</p>

<ul>
<li>4 cylinder, 1000cc</li>
<li>6 cylinder, 1500cc</li>
</ul>

<p>Is it possible to increase the displacement of the 4 cylinder engine to match the performance of the 6 cylinder, or are there other factors involved (i.e. how much do number of cylinders matter)? I imagine that there is a limit to how much you can increase the diameter (bore) of the cylinders. Is there a common range of how much you can reasonably increase the displacement?</p>
","<p>You have a lot of big questions here, so will try to answer them for you, but be ready for the diatribe of the century ;-) There is a simple rule when talking about power/torque output which goes: <strong>There is no replacement for displacement.</strong></p>

<p>If you increase the size of the four cylinder (through whatever method) to match the size of the six cylinder, you will not usually have the same output. There is a rule of thumb which says, to get greater torque, you increase the displacement. To increase the horsepower, you make your engine spin higher. Torque gets you moving, horsepower keeps you moving. Even though the displacement of the four cylinder engine is same as the six cylinder, the six cylinder will fire two more times per engine cycle. This creates smoother power (less vibration). Think of using a huge single cylinder engine having the displacement as your six cylinder. While the single cylinder will be able to run, it will not spin up (rev) as fast as the six cylinder, nor will it be able to spin as high (rpm range) due to the mass of the single piston driving engine, as well as the mass having to be used to counteract the piston. To answer one of your questions, though, <strong>yes, you can usually increase the displacement of your four cylinder to match the six</strong>, but is it worth it? Hopefully some of what follows can explain what I mean.</p>

<p>There are two common ways to increase the displacement of any engine, by increasing bore and/or stroke. Some engines are a lot more susceptible to either of these modifications. I will use the GM Gen I Small Block Chevy (SBC) as an example for demonstration purposes only. The premier displacement for this engine is 350 cubic inch (CI) version. It came with a bore of 4"" and a stroke of 3.48"". To compute this given any bore/stroke, use the following: </p>

<ul>
<li>πr^2 x stroke x # of cylinders = 3.1416 x radius(squared) x stroke x # of cylinders</li>
</ul>

<p>In the case of the 350:</p>

<ul>
<li>3.1416 x 2^2 x 3.48 x 8</li>
<li>3.1416 x 4 x 3.48 x 8</li>
<li>12.5664 x 3.48 x 8</li>
<li>43.731 x 8</li>
<li>349.849 or rounded to 350 CI</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, each cylinder has a displacement of nearly 44 CI. If you increase the number of cylinders to 10, you would then have 440CI instead of the 350CI in the the normal SBC engine. This is not practical for most, as to actually add cylinders would require a master machinist and a lot of tools to make it happen. So, what is left? </p>

<p>You can increase the bore of each cylinder. A common rebuild overage when boring the 350 is .030"" (normally referred to as ""30 over""). If you plug the new diameter of 4.030"" into the formula, you would then have a displacement of 355CI (if all else remains the same). This is not a huge amount of gain for this procedure, but does yield a larger displacement. Increasing the bore size is the easier of the two ways to increase the displacement, but yields smaller results. Also, in a block, you can only bore the block so much, before the cylinder walls become too thin to be able to contain the combustion cycle. Most Gen I SBCs can withstand being bored +.060"" over standard without too much of a problem. To go further than that, you must check the thickness of the cylinder wall to ensure it is thick enough to support what it needs to. </p>

<p>The other way to increase the displacement is by ""stroking"" the engine, or adding more stroke. To do this, there are several different ways to accomplish it. An old school way was to do what is called offset grinding of the rod journal on the crankshaft. This is done by making the journal smaller on the <em>inside</em> of the journal face. The outer face remains basically untouched. This may be hard to visualize, so just understand it is one method, and is not used that much any more. The more practical way to increase the the stroke is to buy an aftermarket crankshaft which has the offset built into it. There are many manufacturers which provide such components for many of the popular engines used (or reused) today. A quick trip on the internet can provide you with a stroker crank with a stroke of 3.80"". This stroke, when plugged into our formula above would net a displacement of ~383CI. With only +.32"" of stroke, you have gained 33CI. The 383 stroker is a common stroker engine because back in the day, smart engine builders took the crankshaft out of a 400CI SBC and put it into the 350, which yielded the 383CI. This was done because the 350 block was much more plentiful than the 400CI blocks, plus, had a lot fewer problems. There are considerations when putting larger stroke cranks in engine, the most prevalent being clearances. You have to consider since the connecting rods are now being slung out further, they run the chance of hitting some part of the block where they used to not be. The connecting rods also get closer to where the cam shaft resides as the stroke increases. You can machine the block in strategic areas to prevent contact. To keep it from contacting the cam shaft requires a bit more planning. This is not true for every engine, but for those in the V configuration it is a distinct possibility.</p>

<p>Another consideration of how well an engine runs (thus the power output) is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volumetric_efficiency"">volumetric efficiency</a> or VE. In basic terms, VE is how well the cylinder fills with the air/fuel mixture. Under normal circumstances, a normally aspirated engine (one without a turbo- or super-charger ... talk more on this in a minute) is in the range of 70-80% probably. By making an engine more efficient and increasing VE, you will have a higher power output from the engine (more air/fuel, bigger bang). If you increase the VE by 10%, your power output should increase as much. This leads to forced induction (turbo- and super-charging). Adding a turbo charger to an engine effectively makes the engine ""think"" it is bigger than it really is. Normal atmospheric pressure is ~14psi. The engine in and of itself, is just a very elaborate air pump which produces power. The piston goes down in the cylinder, which creates a vacuum, which is filled by the air/fuel mixture. By using a turbo, you more completely fill the cylinder, getting your VE to over 100%. If you run your turbo at 14psi, you are basically doubling the amount of air/fuel into the cylinder, which in turn basically doubles the amount of power output from a given engine without increasing the size of the cylinder. Theoretically, if you have your 1000cc 4-cylinder engine, which may put out 100hp, if you do this you should have an output of 200hp. This is a very simplistic model, as you have factors involved such as compression ratio, tuning, component strength, and others, to worry about. </p>

<p>To understand if the engine you intend on increasing the displacement on can handle it, the easiest thing to do is check on the internet. There are forums aplenty for just about every type of engine produced. If it's out there, there are people wanting to have greater engine output. Some engines it is very easy to make modifications to, as there is a large aftermarket following. Many popular engines can be built completely with aftermarket parts. Other engines, you have to build by the seat of your pants. </p>

Hard braking doesn't cause this noise, and normal driving or accelerating doesnt' either. I'm thinking its' something that was done incorrectly when doing the tires, but I want to go back to the shop armed with knowledge. </p>

<p>Car I'm driving is a '05 civic Si, standard 15 inch wheel tires. I'm fairly certain that I have disks on all four wheels. I'd be surprised if it had drums on the back.</p>
","<p>It could be incorrectly torqued wheels, loose disc brake calipers, brake pad shims, suspension pieces loading/unloading from the weight shift. If they just did the tires, take it back and tell them to take a look (for free).</p>

<p>Try slowing the car down with the engine. If it's manual, just downshift. If it is automatic, shift the selector to one of the lower gears at speed to force the transmission to downshift. See if the clunk happens. If so, it's probably suspension. If not, brakes.</p>

"Best way to approach a tire with a bubble in the sidewall","38486","","<p>I found a bubble in my front right tire's sidewall on my 2006 Mazda3 2.3L (FWD, open diff).  So it needs to be replaced.  The replacement tire will end up going on the rear as it's time to rotate them anyway.  Will any damage be done by putting the new tire back on the drives in 5,000 miles after the next rotation?</p>

<p>Specifically: Am I going to damage the diff by putting tires with a 20,000 mile wear difference on?</p>
","<p>Not sure what damage might happen to the diff, but on the front axle this might cause the car to pull one direction or at least create extra stress due to one wheel gripping differently than the other side.</p>

","<p>With your added information, this sounds like there is a definite problem with the transmission. Your description leads me to believe it probably has something to do with the clutches being worn out in conjunction with low line pressures (or some such). I would definitely believe the transmission is due for an overhaul. If you pull the dipstick, does the transmission fluid smell burnt and/or appear dark brown in color? If so, this is another tell tale sign. The soft parts in an automatic transmission will only last so long before they start exhibiting these types of problems. I would highly doubt there is anything wrong with the engine (at this point).</p>

","<p>Depends where you drove, it might simply be an issue with the battery needing more of a charge than your trip could give it.

<p>I'd put the battery on a decent charger until the charger reports that the battery is fully charged and see if it works again.

<p><strong>REFERENCE:</strong> For anyone else that comes later and wants to know where or what to look for when looking for their wheel weights (other than the ones Bob has already shown in his answer).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kJtxc.jpg"" alt=""Picture of wheel weights""> </p>
","<p>I think you threw a wheel weight.</p>

<p>Let's consider this quote from the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire_balance"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">great Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When the wheel rotates, asymmetries of mass may cause it to hop or
  wobble, which can cause ride disturbances, usually vertical and
  lateral vibrations. It can also result in a wobbling of the steering
  wheel or of the entire vehicle. The ride disturbance, due to
  unbalance, usually increases with speed. Vehicle suspensions can
  become excited by unbalance forces when the speed of the wheel reaches
  a point that its rotating frequency equals the suspension’s resonant
  frequency.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What has most likely happened is that one of the little weights placed around the rim of the wheel has been lost.  If you visually inspect your wheels, you'll likely see several of these:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KOvJe.jpg"" alt=""Tire weight made of Zinc""></p>

<p>You will also likely see a shiny spot on the wheel where one of the weights used to be.  </p>

<p>If this is the problem, it is a straightforward process for a tire shop to rebalance the wheels.  This can be made even simpler if you can tell them which wheel is problematic.</p>

"What are the benefits of premium (high octane) petrol?","37783","","<p>Here in the UK it's common for petrol (gas) stations to offer both regular and ""premium"" unleaded petrol.

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: It looks as though there are regional differences with respect to fuels marketed as ""premium"". S_Niles says in the answer below that in the US, ""premium"" implies ""high octane"", pure and simple. Here in the UK, ""premium"" implies ""high octane plus additives"". (<a href=""http://tesco.com/Momentum99/productBenefits-overview.asp"">Here's an example</a>) It's that ""high octane plus additives"" stuff that I'm interested in.</p>
","<p>There is absolutely no reason to use higher-octane fuel unless your car explicitly requires it. </p>

<p>The higher the octane, the more compression/heat required to combust the fuel. In high-performance engines (turbo-charged, high compression cylinders, etc), a higher octane fuel is needed so the fuel doesn't combust prematurely (knocking).</p>

<p>If you put this fuel in a ""normal"" engine, it may even have detrimental effects, since the engine will have a harder time combusting the higher octane fuel.</p>

<p>Even if your car requests a higher octane fuel, it may be possible to use a lower octane fuel because of variable timing and other magic. Your manual would state that. However, it will not have as much performance, since the timing is being retarded to prevent knocking.</p>

<p>Note: I am assuming that in the UK, premium = high-octane, the same as here in the States. Over here, premium is ONLY a designation of octane rating, and has nothing to do with the additive package, etc.</p>

"What modifications need to be made to an engine to enable higher safe RPMs?","37620","","<p>I first had this question while playing a racing game - it was a touring race with BMW 320i's, and I noticed that I could rev up to 8,500 RPM before shifting gears.  Now my car (an older 320i), certainly can't hit 8,500 RPM - it can do a bit over 6,500 RPM before I need to shift (the rev limiter kicks in shortly after that).</p>

<p>I'd expect that one of the modifications would be adjusting/removing the rev limiter, but I also expect that if I did that to my engine as is, it would suffer.  So what engine modifications are needed to enable safe higher RPMs?</p>

<p>Back to racing games again, in Forza Motorsport 2 there's modification which enables this - ""racing cams and valves"".  Might this be one of them?</p>

<p>By the way, by ""safe"", I don't mean zero negative impact (I'd be surprised if an engine lasted just as long after such modifications), but perhaps minimal negative impact.  Sorry for the subjectivity of this, but hopefully we can get some useful answers!</p>

<p>PS there really should be a ""modifications"" tag.</p>
","<p>The rev limiter would have to be removed. This would be involved in a <strong>custom</strong> <code>DME</code>. With the limiter removed then you'd be able to blow it up if you wanted to.</p>

<p>To support the higher revs, the vehicle would need the engine internals worked on. Stronger camshaft(s), valves, valve springs. <em>(Head work)</em>. Depending on the strength of the rotating assembly at the core of the engine, you could even be looking at crank/piston/rod work as well.</p>

<p>Then you'd have to start looking at the transmission. If it will be able to support the higher revs. What I mean by this is if the clutches, orbitals, front pump (if applicable), input/output shafts, will be able to withstand the rise in pressures and temperatures. </p>

"Checking Tire Pressure when the tire is warm or cold","37373","","<p>Witnessed a recent debate about what is the appropriate temperature to check tire pressure at.  The debate centered around warm or cold, there wasn't an exact temperature given by any of the parties.</p>

<p><strong>What is the appropriate time to take your tire pressure and fill your tires?</strong></p>

<p><strong>When they are warm or when they are cold?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Why should tire pressure be taken at that particular time of warm or cold?</strong></p>
","<p>Cold. All OEM's door placards specify the tire pressure be set when the tires are ""cold"". But what is cold? From a random Honda owners manual:</p>

<p><em>Measure the air pressure when tires are cold. This
means the vehicle has been parked for at least three
hours, or driven less than 1 mile (1.6 km). If
necessary, add or release air until the specified
pressure is reached.
If checked when hot, tire pressure can be as much as
4–6 psi (30–40 kPa, 0.3–0.4 kgf/cm2) higher than if
checked when cold.</em></p>

<p>Note: This means ambient outside air temp, not inside a warm garage.</p>

<p>Low tire pressures carries far higher risk than high pressure. Since low pressure causes tire heating which leads to rapid deterioration and possible explosion. Low tires also cause poor handling due to higher flexibility in the sidewalls. </p>

<p>High pressure carries a shorter list of problems; The smaller and misshaped contact patch increase centerline wear and can reduce road friction.</p>

<p>The OEM's want the pressure on the higher end of the allowed range because of the lower risk and the pressure is going to drop naturally. </p>

"Remote does not always lock/unlock the car: diagnosing RF receiver issues","37199","","<p>The remote central locking thing on my car key does not alway lock or unlock the car. Sometimes it works right away, sometimes I have to press it dozens of times before it works, sometimes it never works at all. I've tried it at various distances and this does not seem to make a difference. I've replaced (and measured) the battery inside the remote but it's brand new.</p>

<p>My guess is something is up with the RF receiver. However, how does one go about diagnosing this? Any tell-tale signs worth looking for during a visual inspection? Is there a way of using a multimeter to measure wether or not the receiver is actually receiving the signal?</p>
","<p>I have had a similar issue with remote controls before. Just for completeness, I've already listed two things you've already tried -- they're primarily for anyone who reads this some time in the future.</p>

<h2>Replace the battery</h2>

<p>You already know this one, but it's the easiest and most typical fix.  It's also pretty inexpensive, so a good thing to try. If you get the same symptom with a fresh battery, verify that the battery really is fresh by measuring the voltage if you have a voltmeter.</p>

<h2>Make sure you're on the driver's side of the car</h2>

<p>Many cars have the receiver mounted to optimize reception from approaching the driver's side door.  There's often a big difference in performance (distance between you and the vehicle) depending on which side of the vehicle you approach. </p>

<h2>Check the locking mechanisms in the doors</h2>

<p>Usually, if you're close enough to the vehicle, you can hear the ""click"" of the lock solenoid.  If you hear that but the door doesn't reliably unlock, the problem is much more likely to be the locking mechanism in the door rather than either the transmitter or receiver.  Verify by using the electronic locking buttons within the car to see if they reliably lock and unlock the doors.  If not, sometimes all that's required is a little lithium grease on the locking mechanism ... after you've spent an hour or so taking the door apart.</p>

<h2>Clean the contacts</h2>

<p>Many remotes use a carbon ""button"" embedded into a flexible membrane. It is intended to contact a small matching interlocking comb pattern of copper (or sometimes carbon on copper) on the circuit board.  Sometimes these carbon buttons will fail due to dirt or moisture or corrosion so gently cleaning them (and any other contacts, such as the battery) with a pencil eraser will fix the problem.  (BTW, this same trick works on many TV remote controls.)</p>

<h2>Touch up solder joints</h2>

<p>If you have a soldering iron and know how to use it, you might try touching up the soldered joints in the remote, especially the ones for the battery and for the antenna (if the antenna isn't part of the circuit board).</p>

<h2>Tune the transmitter</h2>

<p>This is somewhat advanced, but with a garage door opener I once had, one of the remotes worked well and the other didn't.  I opened up the poorly performing one (after doing all of the above steps) and adjusted a trim capacitor on the board for maximum output signal from the RF oscillator as measured with an oscilloscope with built-in frequency counter.  If you don't have access to such equipment, you'd be ill advised to try this.  Twiddling adjustments manually without instrumentation is only likely to make the problem worse.</p>

<h2>Replace the remote</h2>

<p>If you can get a dealer to verify that there is a performance problem with the remote, they might be willing to replace it, depending on the warranty status of the vehicle.  Otherwise, be prepared to pay what seems to me to be a lot of money for a replacement.  A recent replacement keyfob for my daughter's 2013 Fiat cost $300.</p>

<h2>Replace the receiver</h2>

<p>This is almost always difficult and expensive and is listed last for those reasons.  On modern cars with security features tied to the particular car, this will likely require dealer tools that you don't have and can't easily buy.  If none of the steps above worked, I'd probably report it to the dealer and hope that either it's a known and covered defect that the dealer will replace for free <em>or</em> that my wallet survives the beating.</p>

<p>My entire dashboard has been sticky / tacky for years.  I do not know why or how it got this way.  It accumulates dust and grime, and I have no way to properly clean it since all towels and cleaning cloths, unless extremely wet, get caught on it, and then it accumulates fibers from the cleaning cloths.  If I press into the dashboard with my finger, it retains a fingerprint.  I can easily cleave a piece off with my nail.  It has been this way since at least a year after I bought the car, and the Toyota dealership I brought it to insisted that it was my fault, and that I must have used some sort of corrosive cleaning solution on the dashboard, but I hadn't.

<p><strong><em>Original, December 17th, answer follows</em></strong></p>

<p>I discovered the following during research after I posted the question.</p>

<p>Searching online against <em>""Toyota Camry Sticky Dashboard""</em> returns many very specific results, including <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47W3SLkgVp0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">videos</a>.  There are many reports of Toyota Camry vehicles (standard, hybrid, and other variants) from the 2007-2009 year range producing a sticky dashboard, which eventually transforms into a shiny, reflective surface, which creates a definite driving safety hazard, obstructing the driver's view.</p>

<p>Per <a href=""http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/21726645/exclusive-some-toyota-camrys-suffer-from-sticky-cracking-dashboards"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hawaii News Now</a>, Toyota's stance is the original warranty only.  As this tackiness of the dashboard seems to happen more often after 3 years, once the warranty has ended, and since there is no recall program, many owners are out of luck.</p>

<p>What can a consumer do?  Concerned U.S. consumers can <a href=""https://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/ivoq/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">file a complaint</a> with the <a href=""http://www.nhtsa.gov"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a> (NHTSA) with an emphasis on (1) the stickyness of the dashboard, and (2) the shiny/reflective surface the dashboard creates, as a safety hazard.  Reviewing the NHTSA complaints reveals multiple submissions regarding this specific issue; perhaps if there are more submitted, the NHTSA will investigate and prompt a recall.</p>

<p>Otherwise, I cannot recommend how to repair the surface.</p>

<p><strong>Feb. 19, 2016 UPDATE:</strong> Of note, I have been on a waiting list to have this repaired for over a year; my local dealer claims that Toyota has not yet shipped any replacement dashboards, but I find this hard to believe.</p>

<p><strong>April 2016 UPDATE:</strong> One year and four months after getting the warranty extension, my local dealer finally received dashboards and replaced mine.  It looks fine now; no issues, no stickiness.  Now if only they'd address the poor leather stitching, the degrading ceiling fabric, the disintegrating steering wheel, and the interior black paint chipping off the power window buttons.  I'm never buying a Toyota again.</p>

<p><strong>January 2017 UPDATE:</strong> They replaced the cracking dashboard of my wife's Solara convertible, which was also under the recall.  Unlike my dashboard, hers has a very funky smell, as though someone had smoked several packs of cigarettes around it.  The dealership assured us this is normal and will fade over time.</p>

"Can I jumpstart a non-hybrid car from a hybrid or full electric car?","37131","","<p><a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/21275/starting-using-a-deep-cycle-battery"">This morning I had starter battery troubles</a> with my 2001 VW Eurovan.  As it happened, my father-in-law arrived just at the right time in his fancy new Toyota Camry hybrid.  So we opened the hoods, dug out the jumpstart cables and then got stuck.</p>

<p>Under the hood of the hybrid Camry is very unfamiliar territory.  I think I was able to identify an internal combustion engine in there, but there was nothing that remotely resembled a good, ol' fashioned lead-acid battery with red and black posts to clip the jump leads to.</p>

<p>Now by definition, hybrid cars have oodles of battery power, but is any of this whizzy new battery power available to jumpstart hapless internal-combustion vehicles whose century-old technology has given out on them?</p>

<p>In other words, can a I use a hybrid vehicle to jumpstart a non-hybrid vehicle?  If so, how?</p>

<p>Case in point is a Toyota Camry hybrid, but I'd also be interested in the general case (any hybrid or full electric vehicle).</p>
","<p><a href=""http://www.plugincars.com/why-do-electric-cars-have-lead-acid-12-volt-batteries-when-lithium-lighter-129118.html"">There are two power systems on <em>all</em> electric cars</a> (fully electric and hybrids alike). This is in conjunction with the much higher voltage battery packs which normally power the electric motors. The reason for this extra power system is to power things like lights, electronics, and HVAC systems (to name a few). Most hybrid vehicles (and never a fully electric vehicle) do not have an alternator. Instead they have a DC to DC converter which steps down the power from the battery pack to recharge the 12v lead-acid battery.</p>

<p>You can use this 12v system to jump other vehicles. The key is to know where the battery is located. In some cars, it is located in the trunk area. In other cars it is located up front. In yet other cars the battery is not easily accessed, but there are power provisions (studs) which allow you to clamp onto with jumper cables. It is good to know <em>exactly</em> where your 12v battery is located not only for jumping other vehicles, but also in case your vehicle ever needs to be jumped.</p>

<p>I have seen noted to be careful when jumping your car or jumping to another car. You need to use the cables to charge the dead battery. Don't let there be large surges of electricity or you can damage electronics. If you leave the jumper cables in place for a while, this will allow some electricity to build up in the dead battery before you try to actually start the other vehicle. As small as this auxiliary battery is on a fully electric car, I don't think I'd use it to jump another vehicle, though you would still need to know where it's at in case you ever need to get it started.</p>

"Is Start & Stop technology good or bad for my car? (Alfa MiTO)","37113","","<p>I was recently in the lucky position to obtain an (almost brand new) Alfa Romeo MiTo, Progression. Like many new cars coming out these days, it has ""Start &amp; Stop"" technology that turns the engine off when the car is stationary and is put in neutral and the clutch is released. When putting down the clutch again the engine fires back up.</p>

<p>My question then is this: </p>

<p>a) Is start-stop technology bad for my engine in any way? </p>

<p>b) What impact might start-stop have on my battery? I.e. won't it deteriorate battery life with the constant turning on and off? (The radio, fans and lights remain on whilst in ""stop""-mode, but not things like the aircon.)</p>

<p>c) Will this technology really benefit me that much with regards to fuel-consumption? I can imagine it will be more economic when stops in heavy traffic become really long or traffic lights are red for long periods, but for the most part when driving the car doesn't turn off for longer than a minute at most before I have to ""start"" it up again.</p>

<p>As many new cars lately have this technology I imagine that it can't be that bad, but I'm curious as to it's actual real benefits. I can turn this feature off, but I have to do so every time I start my car up for the first time and then I'm stuck with this glaring orange light in my dash, letting me know it's turned off.</p>
","<p>I would imagine that this sort of technology would lead to increased wear on your starter motor, as it is being used far more than it would normally be, however I would hope that they would have anticipated this and designed the starter to be more robust than a traditional one.</p>

<p>The battery should be able to cope with it fine all the time it is in good condition. Batteries do, however, deteriorate over time, with a usual life of around 8-10 years at most. I suspect that as your battery starts to deteriorate, it won't be able to cope as well with the increased drain, leading to the car failing to re-start with traditional flat-battery symptoms. How well the electronics cope with this remains to be seen!</p>

<p>As to your third question, I doubt it will help much at all. Getting an engine started needs quite a lot of energy (hence the big chunky battery), and the only way to get that energy is to burn fuel, through your alternator sapping power as it recharges the battery. I don't know the exact figures, but I suspect you'd have to have the engine off for a fair while to save enough fuel to offset the cost of starting it again.</p>

"Loose Handbrake?","36839","","<p>Today I think I pulled my handbrake maybe a little too hard to stop my self from rolling down a hill. The stick is now loose and it engages only when I pull it to the very top. I can pull it up without any effort until it reaches that engage point.</p>

<p>Anyway, is it dangerous to continue using it this way?</p>

<p>Edit: its a 97 Toyota Levin</p>
","<p>You have either stretched the cable(s) or pulled them out of alignment, both of which can usually be solved by re-adjusting them. </p>

<p>The adjuster can be found at the point the cables reach the lever, but depending on the design it may be inside the car (under some trim between the seats) or underneath - Your workshop manual should tell you which it is, and how far to adjust it. Generally you should aim for it to be fully engaged 3-4 clicks before the top of the lever's travel, but that does vary.</p>

<p>One caveat is that if the cable has stretched too far, there will not be enough adjustment left to tighten it, in which case you will need new cables. Replacement is obviously a more complicated job than adjustment, but usually still within the scope of a fairly competant DIY mechanic.</p>

<p>The danger of driving a car with a non-functional handbrake is that you no longer have an emergency brake in the event of a service brake failure. Additionally, you won't be able to park on a slope! (unless it is a manual car and you park it in gear)</p>

"Can I disable antitheft (PATS) on 03 Mustang?","36762","","<p>Just bought an 03 Mustang from an auction and took it on a trip.  The anti-theft system kicked in and I had to disconnect/reconnect the battery to get it working again.  That worked a few times and I thought it would continue to work until I got home where I would get it looked at.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it stopped working altogether and I had to tow it to a dealership.  I asked them to disable the anti-theft system altogether but they tell me that's not an option and I have to fix it.  A call to my regular mechanic who I trust confirmed that they were telling the truth.</p>

<p>However, I've seen webpages talking about 'tunes' and 'tuners' (I have no idea what that is though) you can get to disable it and referencing Mustangs specifically and I'm pretty sure one page was even specifically talking about the '03 Mustang.</p>

","<p>If you want to bypass your antitheft, you can attach one of your PATS keys inside your steering collumn by the lock cylinder. This will make the car always 'see' a key with a chip. You caqn then use a regular steel key. This is also a 'cheater' fix when installing remote starts on cars with PATS so you don't need to buy a module.</p>

","<h1>No, you don't have to rely on wire colors to figure out what's what.</h1>

<hr>

<p>With nothing more than a decent multimeter and premix flame (blowtorch or gas stove), a two-test sequence can reveal the identity of each wire, assuming the O2 sensor is fully-functional:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong><em>Determine the heater wires</em></strong></p>

<p>This should be done first. These wires serve to heat up the O2 sensor to bring it up to operating temperature via a resistance-based heating element.</p>

<p>To test, set the multimeter to resistance mode and use it to probe and figure out which wires register a resistance (usually 4-6 Ω). The two wires which register a resistance reading are the heater wires; the other two will show up as an open circuit or infinite resistance.</p>

<p>As the O2 heater is resistor-based, polarity is not a concern here. Note down which two wires correspond to the heater circuit and proceed to Test 2.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Determine sensor signal polarity</em></strong></p>

<p>The O2 sensor signal gives an indication of oxygen content sensed by the probe by sending an induced voltage that corresponds to the level of oxygen detected. However, this does require the sensor to be heated up to operating temperature. <strong>Necessary precaution must be taken</strong>.</p>

<p>To test, set the multimeter to voltage mode and attach its probes to the two non-heater wires, noting which probe is negative and which is positive. Heat up the sensor's tip with the premix flame. Within a minute, the sensor should register a voltage in the 0-1 V range.</p>

<p>If the voltage signal is positive, this indicates that the positive multimeter probe is connected to the signal wire and negative probe is connected to earth.</p>

<p>If the voltage signal is negative, the multimeter probes have been connected in the opposite sense, so the negative probe is connected to the signal wire, while the positive probe is connected to earth.</p></li>

"Which Reluctor Wheel on LS Engines?","36598","","<p>Around 2005 or 2006, GM started using a 58-tooth reluctor wheel, where before they used a 24-tooth wheel in the LSx based engines (LS1, LS2, LS3, etc.). This wheel is used as a way for the computer to detect where the crankshaft is at in its rotational cycle. I have done a lot of research, but have found no credible source to tell me exactly how to tell. I believe there was some overlap in model years where GM used both wheels. The reason this is important is the PCM is specific with respect to the wheel.</p>

<p>How do you tell which engine has which wheel without tearing the engine apart?</p>
","<p>All engines shipped from GM since January 2006 carry the newer 58x reluctor wheel. If you have an early LS2 (PN 12499750) then it's considered an '05 engine and will carry the 24x reluctor wheel like the LS1 and LS6 variants. This is important to know when you start shopping around for a computer to run your engine. Any LS engine can be converted either way by swapping out the reluctor wheel, but it's a bit of a pain since it has to be pressed onto the crank.

Secondly, all 24x wheels are detected by a black sensor, while 58x use a grey sensor.

<p>Manufacturers like to boast about their all new aluminium engines does this really mean anything to the customer?</p>

<p>Should i buy a slightly more powerful cast iron engine or the less powerful aluminium engine?</p>
","<p>You've already stated the main reason for the aluminum blocks which is the weight reduction. It is the same reasoning which has led Ford to produce their F-Series trucks with an aluminum body: weight reduction equates to better fuel economy. Most manufacturers today are using aluminum in various places to reduce the overall weight of the vehicle. As far as rusting goes, this usually isn't an issue on cast iron blocks as it's life is spent under cover. Only when it is left sitting in the elements does it suffer this fate.</p>

<p>Since you are reducing weight in the front end of the vehicle, it can in most instances provide a better weight bias as well. For those vehicles which are concerned with centering the weight of the vehicle (ie: Corvette), taking 110 lbs off the front of the car (when they moved to the LS1 engine and variants) helped a lot in this transition (moving the transmission to the rear of the car helped as well). This can provide better cornering attitude and help with over/under steer mannerisms. </p>

<p>There are three main advantages (that I can think of) for a cast iron block over an aluminum one:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dimensional Stability: Aluminum grows more during the heating process than does iron. Extra precautions must therefore be built into aluminum blocks so as counteract this condition and prevent issues.</li>
<li>No Cylinder Liners: If you <em>ever</em> want to rebuild an aluminum block where the cylinder liners are toast, they must be replaced. This is a large machining expense in comparison to having to just bore the cylinders in a cast iron block. </li>
<li>Cost: Cast iron has been used in industry for many years and is fairly easy to produce. Aluminum, on the other hand, costs a lot more to refine from bauxite ore. Just in materials alone, the cost is greater. Then look at the cost for the cylinder liners and special casting processes which must be employed to get the aluminum block correct and the cost goes even higher. There is some trade-off, however, in the heating process (doesn't take as much energy to melt aluminum v. cast iron), and aluminum is easier to machine (less wear on the machine tooling/fixtures v. cast iron). </li>
</ul>

<p>I'm not sure why you think any given cast iron block is going to be more powerful than any given aluminum one? This is all dependent upon the engine which you are looking at and what the manufacturer has done in the performance realm. If you are just trying to compare the two, this is a decision you'll have to make on your own.</p>

"Why would the steering be intermittently very heavy in a 2001 Dodge Caravan?","36514","","<p>The steering wheel is very hard to turn immediately after starting the van when the engine is cold.  This only happens intermittently (maybe 1 out of 30 times) After a few seconds it becomes easy to turn, as if the power steering was off and it turned itself on. I checked the the power steering fluid and it is full.</p>

<p>It's a 2001 Dodge Grand Caravan, with about 160,000 miles on it.  Rack and power steering pump are original.</p>

<p>What could be causing this?</p>
","<p>With power steering complaints such as yours where the symptom is intermittent the diagnosis is mostly guesswork in a setting such as this. You can do a few things to get to the source though.</p>

<p><strong>A little about modern power steering</strong> 
Many vehicles have power steering assist controls such as a vehicle speed sensors and pressure switches/solenoids that stage the level of power assist based on speed and steering load. Typically you should have full assist at lower speeds fading into no assist at higher speeds, so at startup in your driveway full assist should be present on your vehicle.</p>

<p>Before working through guesses you should make as many observations as possible to pinpoint things such as leaks or failing components. Look for leaks and listen for odd noises related to turning the steering wheel back and forth.</p>

<p><strong>Possibilities:</strong>
This list of possibilities is not exhaustive and is simply drawn from my personal experience. Your mileage on its usefulness may vary. ;)</p>

<ol>
<li><p><em>Fluid is low</em> - upon startup a car with low fluid can/will develop surges due to air being sucked through the system. Check the fluid level at your power steering reservoir. Adjust the fluid level as necessary.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Fluid is contaminated</em> - power steering fluid will contaminate over time and properly flushing the power steering system is a commonly neglected maintenance item. Depending on driving conditions and fluid quality the contamination can vary from soot developing in the system to goopy sludge caused by moisture. Use a turkey baster to draw out some of the fluid when it is cold and determine whether it is contaminated. The fluid should not be black/opaque. Check your owner's manual for the recommended power steering service interval and do this first if you are having a problem. If the fluid is contaminated then putting off the flush could lead to much more expensive repairs.</p></li>
<li><p><em>The filter is clogging up</em> - this is usually a byproduct of condition #2 and typically the clogging filter is what gets a person to pursue fixing their car's problem. Some vehicles have an inline filter where on others there is a screen built into the reservoir that captures contaminants. Replacing or cleaning the reservoir should be part of a good power steering flush. If your reservoir is clogging then negative pressure on the system can cause wear problems on other components.</p></li>
<li><p><em>The power steering pump is leaking/failing</em> - A failing power steering pump often is visibly leaking. Leaking pumps fail to operate properly due to air/contaminants entering through the bad seal or lack of sufficient operating pressure caused by fluid escaping the seal. (depending on which seal is leaking) Premature failure of a power steering pump can also be experienced when certain power steering fluid types begin to break down or abrasive contaminants are carried through the system. The failing pump is going to get your attention when it begins to buzz, rattle or whine.</p></li>
<li><p><em>The control body is failing</em> - There is a controller consisting of orifices and valves that allows fluid to flow based on need and rack load. This control body has highly precise tolerances and will wear out or clog due to fluid contamination or fluid failure. This unit is typically part of the rack and pinion assembly. If you hear a whine or jitter coming from under the vehicle and in close proximity to where the steering yoke meets your power steering rack then this could be the problem. </p></li>
<li><p><em>Other unknowns</em> - The problem could be none of the above. Kinked or collapsed hoses, electrical problems and even solid state device failure is not out of the question. Anomalies across designs exist and a specialist with your car maker might be the best place to find advice.</p></li>

To me it kind of feels like the first  gear is waiting to catch and then it catches and it jerks.  This only happens when going from being stopped (ie at a stop light).

","<p>The Chevy Impala's <code>4T65E</code> transmission was said to feature an updated <code>Pressure Control Solenoid</code> starting in 2003. This was a major issue in the 2000-2002 model years. But, there are still many people with the 2003MY vehicles that are experiencing the same issue as you. The vehicle may or may not already have illuminated a <strong>Check Engine Light</strong> due to the issue. Even if not, it most likely still has stored a fault that could verify that the <code>Pressure Control Solenoid</code> is faulty. The trouble code for this would be <code>P1811 (max adapt, long shift)</code>. </p>

<p>The component is located behind the side cover of the transmission and should take ~5 hours for a quality mechanic to complete. It is a rather big job and involves lowing the front cradle to gain access. If you're not 100% comfortable with a job of this magnitude this then get the vehicle to a well known transmission shop. </p>

"Will driving through puddles do any damage to my car?","35707","","<p>I've often been told that driving through puddles (anything from a small one to 3-4cm deep) can be bad for my car, and I shouldn't drive through them.</p>

<p>I know about aquaplaning, but is there any other damage driving through puddles can do? </p>

<p>I mean in general, so I could also be doing at high speeds, so there is quite a big splash...</p>

<p>EDIT: Does it have any effect on the brakes as well?</p>
","<p>Your car <em>may</em> have plastic guards underneath to stop water from spraying up on sensitive components, but everything under the hood is typically waterproof to some degree.  That said, the only ""damage"" I have ever seen is the spray of water loosening or tearing off plastic guards that are not properly fastened or half-way ripped off already.</p>

<p>The basic short answer is, it shouldn't break anything that isn't somewhat broken already.  Cracked light housings could get wet, etc.</p>

<p>If the water is deep enough that there is a huge rush of water over the front of the car or the engine bay, you <em>could</em> suck some water into the intake, but then again, the intake/air filter housing is made to deal with this as well.</p>

<p>Added:  The heat from the brake system should dry them very quickly.  There will be a momentary loss of a little braking power, but shouldn't be very noticeable.  Most of the splash will be directed away from the wheels, so the brakes might not even get wet.</p>

<p>I personally love to hit puddles at high speed to see the big spray.  My wife hates it.</p>

<p><strong>Edit based on comments...</strong></p>

<p>For safety, don't speed on residential streets and never hit a big puddle unless you've driven over the same spot in dry weather.  Chances for hydroplaning are great, so go over puddles in a straight line and avoid steering or braking input until the puddle is crossed.<br>
Large waves of water can ""hydrolock"" the car if water is sucked into the engine, which is bad.  The intake is made for splashes, not waterfalls.</p>

"Air trapped inside radiator after adding coolant","35591","","<p>It has now happened twice to me that after adding coolant to the radiator, when I turn the car on the RPM's will bounce up and down and the engine is reving (between 1k and 1.5k RPM's).

Be careful poking around the engine bay with the engine running, don't lose any fingers.  Gentle prods from a rubber mallet might be a safer strategy.

"How does cold, dry weather affect horsepower?","34958","","<p>It's now properly winter over here in Australia, and the butt dyno is very favourable of the cold, dry air. It's like a free cold air intake for everyone, right??</p>

<p>I can think of two scientific reasons as to why this may be:</p>

<p><strong>1. Increased air density</strong></p>

<p>Given constant pressure (which seems accurate), the temperature of the air is inversely proportional to the number of air molecules. So colder air means more molecules, and more air molecules means more energy released in each combustion cycle. A drop from 30 C to 0 C is roughly a 10% drop measured in Kelvin, which suggests 10% more energy for each combustion cycle --> 10% more horsepower!</p>

<p><strong>2. Decreased humidity</strong></p>

<p>Water molecules in air can't be particularly helpful for combustion, as those molecules need to heat up but don't combust. 100% humidity seems to correspond to 2.8% water to air ratio - a potentially substantial amount.</p>

<p>However, theories can't be relied upon without taking everything else into account, e.g. an engine may not even adjust for the increased air density, and thus run lean.</p>

<p>So, does anyone have some reliable data on the impact of cold, dry air on engine performance?</p>
","<p><strong>tl;dr: Cold dry air has a substantial effect on horsepower.  This can be confirmed through experimentation on any modern car.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I can think of two scientific reasons as to why this may be:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li><p>Increased air density</p></li>
  <li><p>Decreased humidity</p></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes and yes.  You're already most of the way there.  </p>

<p>Let's take a quick trip to simplified theoretical model land:</p>

<ol>
<li>The engine runs on oxygen molecules.</li>
<li>Density of the air determines how many oxygen molecules we have to work with.</li>
<li>Ergo, we want to maximize the density of the air.</li>
</ol>

<p>In your example, we have two knobs that we can turn on our theoretical model: temperature and humidity.  That second becomes confusing quickly when we realize that humidity affects the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_heat"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">heat capacity of the air</a>.  That's a perplexing concept (heat, temperature, aren't they the same?!) until you realize that specific heat is almost like mass: the more specific heat a thing has, the harder it is to change its temperature.  </p>

<p>Practical example: turn on a gas stove to max.  Put your hand directly over the burner.  Note the near instant first degree burns: the air over the grill heats up very fast.  Put a five gallon pot full of water on the same burner (hey, it takes a lot of water to make beer!).  Put your hand in the pot all the way down to the bottom (not touching).  Note that you're the same distance that you were from the burner but no burns!  The water has a higher specific heat and is much more sluggish in changing temperatures.</p>

<p>So, that was fun.  Why do we care?  We care because, if you're trying to maximize density, you're starting with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isentropic_process#Table_of_isentropic_relations_for_an_ideal_gas"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this ideal gas law equation</a>:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OxqNl.png"" alt=""\Bigg\lbrack \frac{T_2}{T_1} \Bigg\rbrack = \left (\frac{\rho_2}{\rho_1} \right )^{(\gamma - 1)}""></p>

<p>Where</p>

<ul>
<li>T = temperature</li>
<li>rho = density</li>
<li>gamma = the ratio of specific heats (constant pressure / constant volume)</li>
</ul>

<p>... except that you suddenly realize that this is no longer an ideal gas: gamma is not constant since you're changing the humidity.  Check the first two lines of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_heat#Table_of_specific_heat_capacities"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">table of specific heat entries</a> for two examples for air that are similar to the ones that you suggest.  The constant pressure heat capacity jumps quite a lot between the two lines, largely due to the increase in humidity: 40.85% humidity is cited as being 1.16% water vapor content.  If you look further down that chart, you see what we expected: the specific heat of water is much higher than air, all of which eventually brings us back to the fact that <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity#Air_density_and_volume"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">higher humidity air results in lower useful density of oxygen</a> for our engine to work with.</p>

<p><em>... deep breath ...</em> </p>

<p>So what?  Why don't highly tuned engines break when the air gets cold and dry?  Why can I drive my turbo car at sea level in the winter and in the mountains (well, we call them mountains) in the humid summer? </p>

<p>The short answer is that the engine computer is pretty smart.  It isn't living in theoretical model land.  It has quite a few more sensors measuring plenty of things that I've ignored above.  As a result, it isn't trying to solve for the correct values to match the model: it's setting tuning parameters on the engine and then monitoring the results.  Consequently, it makes an effective numerical approximation of all of the above that:</p>

<p>A. Makes your car run pretty well, providing you with the best possible mileage and power at its disposal.
B. Doesn't blow up on a winter day.</p>

"Mass Air Flow Expected Values","34846","","<p>I have a 2002 Audi A4 Quattro 3.0. I have a Vagcom USB cable and I am trying to diagnose the MAF sensor. I had a friend get some readings from an OBD2 scanner, which indicated that both precat O2 sensors (passenger side and driver side) had negative values. He said that it probably isn't the O2 sensors, since both of them are reading similar readings. He also said it is possibly the MAF sensor or a vacuum leak somewhere. </p>

<p>So to account for the altitude, you should multiply your expected mass flow by 0.83.
According to the VAG-COM diagnosis guide, which I have no reason to doubt, a 200bhp naturally-aspirated engine should flow about 160g/s of air at full-throttle peak power when at sea level. Therefore, at 5,200 ft above sea level, it should flow 160 g/s * 0.83 = 133 g/s. You're seeing 50 g/s.</p>

<p>You're certianly not metering enough air through the MAF. This could be a MAF failure, or a big leak after the MAF.</p>

"Effects of driving through deep water WITHOUT hydrolocking (car still bogged down and died)","34654","","<p>So, yesterday we had very heavy rains, and unfortunately I was driving in an unfamiliar area of town. I drove through high water, which caused my car to sputter and so I turned around. The car behaved normally until I got to higher ground and started to accelerate, then the car choked out and died.

The extra sputtering may have been a case of the filter on your CAI getting soaked with water. I think you got very lucky on this, but have probably come through unscathed.</p>

<p>Check the oil via dipstick. If the oil does not appear milky, I wouldn't worry about it. After oil is up to operating temperature, all of the water in it will evaporate fairly quickly and be taken out through the PCV and burned in the engine.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am also curious if steam could have damaged the iridium plugs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In and of itself, steam will not damage any engine parts (since we have eliminated the possibility of hydrolock here - excessive water will, that's for sure!). Think of water/meth injection systems. They put copious amounts of water (or water vapor) into an engine. As an aside, water injection can be used to effectively increase the octane of fuel, it cleans the combustion chambers, keeps NOx down due to the cooling effects as it enters the intake tract, etc. Also, given the right amounts, water expands greater when it becomes steam than the air/fuel does when burned. Obviously, if too much water is introduced, it will kill the combustion. Lots of water = bad; minor/measured amounts of water = good.</p>

<blockquote>

Have someone start the car. They will probably need to rev the engine during the next part, but only enough to keep it running. With the engine running, slowly dump about 1/2 of the can into the funnel and let it get sucked up by the engine. This will cause volumes of white smoke, but not to worry. This is normal. When you get down to about 1/2 to 1/3 of the can left, dump the rest into the funnel and as soon as it is sucked in, have your helper shut the car off. Let the engine sit for about 10-15 minutes. After the wait is over, start the car back up. This may be a little difficult and again will cause a bunch of smoke. Keep the engine running until the smoke disappears. You have now successfully completed a Seafoam treatment. This will clean all of the carbon out of the intake tract, from the valves, and from the combustion chamber.</p>

"Car turns off due to low RPM, only when starting car","34318","","<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>

<p>I had my 2003 Infiniti g35 at the mechanic to fix an electrical problem (turns out remote starter wires were rubbing and causing a short) and to fix an oil leak. All in all they changed the ignition fuse and a couple relays, and the oil cooler seal.</p>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong>
Ever since I got it back from them the car turns off most of the time immediately after starting it. It looks like it's due to the RPM dropping very low, and if I give it gas in the first second it is able to overcome that initial drop and go on to maintain 200-1000 idle RPM and doesn't turn off. Basically this video is exactly what I experience: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKFe76479ws"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKFe76479ws</a></p>

<p>The mechanic suggested seafoam with premium gas, which I tried but it did not fix this problem.</p>

<p>Based on my research it seems like this would be caused by a dirty throttle body. This car never had these issues before I took it to this mechanic.</p>

<p><strong>My questions are:</strong></p>

<p>1) Does that diagnosis sound correct?</p>

<p>2) Is it possible that the mechanic unintentionally caused this? (Maybe they got some dust on the throttle body or something?)</p>

<p>3) Is it true that Nissan and Infiniti throttle bodies should not be cleaned by someone who is not an expert (i.e. dealer) due to it being a delicate operation and easy to mess up and require some sort of electrical reprogramming?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>The problem was caused by a tear in the air intake boot. I think the other reasons mentioned in other answers could also cause the same symptom. I have no way of determining whether or not my previous mechanic had inadvertently caused the issue.</p>

"Interpreting AC Delco's manufacturing date for car batteries","34087","","<p>I understand that AC Delco encodes the month of manufacturing a car battery using <strong>two</strong> digits and encodes the year by <strong>one</strong> digit.</p>

<p>The battery I just purchased, for example, is labeled P124R, which, IIUC, means that it was made in December 2014.</p>

<p>I'm puzzled by this ambiguity regarding the decade of manufacture. How does a buyer rule out he's dealing with an exceptionally unscrupulous retailer who put on the market 10+ year-old stock? Just as importantly, how can a manufacturer of AC Delco's renown make the date this ambiguous? Is it, for instance, the case that a battery that has been sitting on a shelf for 11 years will be so unusable that it could not possibly be sold as a one year old battery?</p>
","<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Much of your <em>question</em> seems to be a rant, so I will answer the last part, which seems to have gone unanswered to this point. </p>

<p>According to the <a href=""http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/elevating_self_discharge"" rel=""nofollow"">Battery University</a>, a typical lead acid battery will lose about 5% of its charge every month (whether this means 5% of of the total charge when completely full - ie: 5%, 10%, 15%, etc, or 5% of the <em>remaining</em> charge - ie: 5% of 100%, 5% of 95%, 5% of 90.25%, etc, is unclear). This means if a battery sits on the shelf too long, it will need recharged after a period of time to be fully operable in a vehicle.</p>

<p>That is for a battery which is stored wet (with acid in the cells). A <em>dry</em> battery (one without an electrolyte) will maintain on the shelf indefinitely. Once the electrolyte is placed in the cells, the process begins.</p>

<p>There is another factor which will make a battery go bad. According to the same website:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With usage and age, however, the flooded lead acid builds up sludge in the sediment trap, which causes a soft short when this semi-conductive substance reaches the plates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This can cause issues when the battery gets old. I assume it happens at a slower rate while on the shelf, but will still happen over time as it becomes aged. </p>

<p>What this means is, a battery with acid in the cells can only sit on the shelf for so long before it must be recycled or it will not work right. Have no fear, though, lead from batteries is one of <em>the</em> most recycled things we humans pull out of the ground. A battery which has sat on the shelf for too long, while it may not provide you good usage, will still be able to be exchanged for a new one under the normal battery warranty programs. I'm sure batteries are sold beyond their expiration dates, but they are also easily replaced.</p>

"Can I use spray paint to touch up my car?","34013","","<p>I have several really small nicks and major scuffs on my car; the nicks from driving on the highway (flying debris hitting chassis) and the scuffs from two fender benders. The nicks have started to rust and the scuffs are just annoying, so I'd like to get rid of them. A body repair shop charges me for each body piece, so that doesn't make for a good deal. I was wondering if I can resolve it with something like DAP Touch'n'Tone multipurpose spray paint?</p>
","<p>You can, but probably not in the way you're thinking.  You can't just go out and buy a can of ""red spray paint"", unless you are prepared to re-paint the whole car in that color or you <strong>really</strong> don't care about the results.  This is because your car isn't ""red"" (for example), it's ""Sierra Red (L D3V)"".</p>

<p>However, if you go to a professional paint supply shop you can get them to inject the specific color for your car into a spray can.  You can often get ""touch up"" bottles of paint in the exact color from your dealer.</p>

<p>The rust is another matter though...  If it's surface rust, you may be able to get away with just using primer that reacts with and neutralizes the rust, and then paint over that.  However, if the rust is ""flaking"" or working behind other parts of the paint, you're probably going to have to clean that out, for example with a wire wheel on a tool, possibly making the area you have to paint much larger.  It's either that or risk having to deal with a larger area (or a hole clean through) later.</p>

<p>These rust-reacting primers, like certain models of Rustoleum, work extremely well in my experience.  When I was younger I had a couple of cars that had varying degrees of paint damage near the wheel wells or on the front end, and was very happy with the rust-stopping results of Rustoleum.</p>

<p>In my experience though, if you want something that looks good, you need to do the whole panel.  And if you want something that looks really good, you have to do it with the right tools in a booth.</p>

"2000 VW Golf heater won't blow hot air","33247","","<p>My 2000 2.0L Golf GLS won't blow hot air at operating temperature, the air is only lukewarm at best. This started a few months ago inexplicably. The car isn't overheating or underheating, it reaches operating temperature in the same amount of time as before. Here's what I've done:</p>

<ul>
<li>Checked coolant level - there's plenty.</li>
<li>Flushed coolant system - the previous owner mentioned this same problem and a flush solved it for him, no such luck for me. Ran some Prestone Flush, then flushed water twice, then refilled with regular Prestone (not G12, I know). The only thing that worries me here is that I never felt like I was able to drain <em>all</em> of the fluid when flushing (always found: amount in > amount out).</li>
<li>Bled coolant system - elevated the passenger side (where the bottle is) by driving up onto a snow bank, let it run for 3 minutes. Coolant level didn't change.</li>
<li>Tested thermostat - works correctly and opens right about 195 F. Note that on this vehicle the thermostat blocks off the radiator loop, not the heater core loop which is separate and not controlled by a thermostat.</li>
<li>Checked for heater core blockage - using the input and output connections at the firewall I was able to pass fluid through the core using both gravity and light pressure. Flow rate was substantial, don't suspect blockage.</li>
<li>Checked water pump flow rate - using a clear hose I bypassed the heater core altogether and ran coolant from the engine block output straight back to the coolant bottle. At idle the pump wasn't able to overcome gravity to push up and into the bottle, but as soon as the engine rev'd coolant pumped quickly and with ease.</li>
<li>Checked water pump - OEM VW pumps use a plastic impeller and I suspected it had broken. Pulled the pump and found it was already the metal impeller kind; turns out the previous owner replaced it 2 years ago. Put the old one back in, it's still good.</li>
</ul>

<p>My car doesn't have Climatronic, just the standard climate control system; does that mean it's cable or vacuum controlled? At this point I'm wondering if there isn't simply a fan control gate that's stuck or something. Even though I was able to pass water through it, are there any gates or controls within the heater core itself?</p>

<p>Replacing the heater core is a 8-16 hour DIY job or $850 down at the shop, and I'm not prepared to do either. Short of actually looking at the core, is there anything else I can try, check, or do?</p>

<p>Thanks all, I've been wracking my brain with this one and would love input! </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>After trying my best not to I decided to replace the core. I used a very helpful <a href=""http://forums.vwvortex.com/showthread.php?4188858-DIY-MK-IV-Heater-Core-Replacement"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">VWVortex guide</a> along with a Chilton's manual. 14 hours later I've got air that measures significantly hotter than before, so now it's time to wait and see how things go this winter. I found that I don't have a split HVAC box even though I don't have the Climatronic system (major letdown) and that the flappy bits inside the box were in great shape and moved freely. The old heater core was definitely clogged; simply trying to blow air through it was difficult. For your enjoyment here's what the car looked like when I was finally able to remove the core:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zqp7o.jpg"" alt=""2000 VW Golf dash guts""></p>
","<p>It looks an awful lot like you have diagnosed all of the really hard problems and come up negative.  I wonder if you have a simple mechanical problem: is the linkage sound between the hot / cold selector and the flapper valve that forces air past the heater core.  From what I hear, the foam around the flapper is also prone to disintegration in humid climates: that would allow all or most of your heated air to escape.</p>

<p><em>EDIT:</em> I did manage to find a <a href=""http://forums.vwvortex.com/showthread.php?4188858-DIY-MK-IV-Heater-Core-Replacement"" rel=""nofollow"">reasonable annotated heater core replacement</a>.  I think you're right: this job is a huge pain.  And, no, I can't think of a way to get at the internal air direction valves.</p>

<p><em>Yet another EDIT:</em> Thinking about the diagnosis further, it occurs that you might be able to establish whether you have a bad seal on the flapper valve.  This will work best on a very cold day.</p>

<ol>
<li>Run the car up to operating temperature with heater set to coldest and vent fan off.</li>
<li>Set the vent fan to the least speed that will blow detectable airflow.  This will ensure that you're not feeling artificially cold from the wooshing air from max vent fan.</li>
<li>Check this baseline temperature as best you can: if you don't have a good thermometer, I find that a sniff test works for me.  Seriously, the inside of your nose and sinuses are very sensitive to temperature.  That's how I've detemined what coats and hats my kids needed to wear to school for years.</li>
<li>Set the heater to max (this is where you'll hear the clunk of that valve flapping over).</li>
<li>Wait for what heat is available to make it's way down the vent (i.e., a few minutes).</li>
<li>Check the temperature again.  If you have a working valve with a bad seal, you'll note a slight temperature change (see previous note on sniff test).  </li>
</ol>

<p>Now, even with all of the above, fixing any of these problems will be approximately the same level of hassle.  You're going to have to take off the dash, etc.  My hope is that, if you do invest the time, you'll know what you're looking for.  I'm pretty sure that this isn't a job that you're going to want to do twice.</p>

<p>The antifreeze I got is supposed to be correct for my car; is it safe to add it with the existing fluid or should I ask the dealer what kind they've been using before I mix this in?</p>

<p>The car is a 2003 Acura TL type S.</p>
","<p>If you want to know for sure, you can ask the dealer what they use. It would be good to know for the future anyway.</p>

<p>There are two main types of anti freeze, generally they all use ethylene glycol as the coolant base; though they differ in the type of corrosion inhibitors used. ""Traditional"" coolants (often green or yellow) generally use silicates, while ""new style"" (generally orange or pink) coolants use organic acids. GM's DexCool is an example of a newer organic acid coolant. These two types shouldn't be mixed if possible, as the effectiveness of the corrosion inhibitors can be reduced.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, checking the color of the existing coolant in the expansion tank <a href=""http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/how-to/products/1272436"">isn't good enough</a> to confirm a match against what you bought.</p>

<p>That said, if you merely need to top up the expansion bottle, you may be able to get away with adding only distilled water, which would be compatible with any coolant. Check the coolant concentration with a hydrometer, and if you've got sufficient coolant concentration, you can simply add water.</p>

<p>For what it's worth, apparently someone from the SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) <a href=""http://www.cartalk.com/content/i-have-question-about-antifreeze-many-months-ago-my"">said you can safely mix up to 15%</a> of the traditional coolant type into an organic acid type coolant without much of an effect on the corrosion inhibitors. I'd still avoid it if possible. I've personally seen brown sludgey coolant resulting from mixing traditional coolant into VW/Audi's organic acid coolant.</p>

"What problems can a loose radiator cap cause?","32777","","<p>The radiator caps in all cars seem to be very tightly installed. In some cars (at least in my 2011 Toyota Yaris), the radiator cap is not round so you can remember the position it was at, but in other cars the radiator cap is round and there is thus room for mistightening it. Now suppose I remove and reinstall the radiator cap but forget to tighten it as well as it was tightened previously.</p>

<p>What problems could such loose radiator cap cause?</p>

<p>Can the coolant evaporate through the loose cap, requiring filling up the coolant?</p>

However, there was no question about other problems that a loose radiator cap could cause.</p>
","<p>Cooling systems are under pressure to increase the boiling point of the coolant. This allows the system to operate efficiently without boiling off the coolant and overheating the engine.</p>

<p>A loose radiator cap will cause the system not to pressurize, resulting in overheating. In this case, the coolant is more likely to be lost to boiling off than by simple evaporation. </p>

<p>Depending on the vehicle, it may or may not have the ability to give codes. Can't answer this because your question is not vehicle specific. </p>

<p>Finally, the resulting overheating may strand the driver since the cooling system will have to cool down before it can be refilled and driven. If the engine is operated while overheated, severe mechanical damage may occur.</p>

"What does a flywheel do and what is it connected to?","32545","","<p>I understand roughly <a href=""http://animagraffs.com/how-a-car-engine-works/"">how an engine works</a> and that there is a crankshaft which is able to turn the flywheel using internal combustion.</p>

<li><p><strong><em>What exactly does the flywheel do and what is it connected to other than the crankshaft?</em></strong></p></li>
<li><p>How is it connected to these other things?</p></li>
</ul>
","<p>A flywheel serves four main purposes (in most vehicles): </p>

<ul>
<li>It provides mass for rotational inertia to keep the engine in motion</li>
<li>It is specifically weighted to provide balance for the crankshaft</li>
<li>It provides a means to get the engine started (starter ring)</li>
<li>It provides a connection for power transfer between the engine and transmission (along with the clutch it also provides a means to interrupt the power flow)</li>
</ul>

<p>Another such item, like unto a flywheel is a flexplate. This is a thin plate which connects the engine to a torque converter in automatic transmissions. While it provides the starting, connection, and balance of a flywheel, it alone does not have enough mass to provide the rotational inertia. In this case, the torque converter provides this for the engine. </p>

"Bleeding Brakes with Car on or off?","32191","","<p>There's a pump that runs when the car is on to pressurize the hydraulics, right?  </p>

<p>When bleeding the brakes, should the car be on or off so this pump is on or off?</p>

<p>I'm specifically talking about a Honda '03 if that affects the question.</p>
","<p>If what you meant was bleeding the brakes at the calipers to remove air from the system, you should bleed the brakes with the car off. While 'pump' was the wrong word to use, the brake booster runs off the engine vacuum (it's a large diaphragm that multiplies brake force), and this should not be active. You can feel the difference by pumping the brakes a few times with the car off, then pushing with a medium effort on the brake pedal while starting; once the engine starts, the same effort will sink the pedal further and put more force on the hydraulics.</p>

<p>When you bleed brakes, you want to have an assistant push the brake pedal while you crack open the line and then close it BEFORE the pedal hits the floor (or you'll introduce air into the caliper). If the engine is running, not only is this unsafe (front axles can spin, hitting your hands if the front is in the air or moving off the stands if the rear is up), but it drastically changes the pressure at which the fluid will shoot out of the calipers and shrink the time to close the bleeder screw before the pedal hits the floor.</p>

<p>Summary: Bleed brakes (at the calipers) with the engine off.</p>

"Is it bad to drive slow at low rpms in 4th or 5th gear? Do you get better gas mileage?","32136","","<p>Obviously running your engine at too high an RPM for too long isn't good.

<p>Would you get better gas mileage?  Would it wear out the engine or transmission faster?</p>

<p>For example, going 20 mph in 5th gear down a quiet city street that you know has no stop signs for half a mile or more.</p>
","<p>To answer your question, no it isn't bad for your car to keep it in as high a gear as you can while still maintaining speed. As long as you are above idle in RPM and your engine isn't lugging, you aren't doing any damage.</p>

<p><a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/2161/fuel-efficiency-and-shifting-rpm/2170#2170"">See this link for more information about lugging.</a></p>

<p>You mentioned that you might do this to be quieter and for fuel efficiency. Your car will certainly be quieter, so this is one advantage. As for fuel efficiency, there is such a thing as being in too high a gear in <em>certain</em> situations. Because of the vacuum created when the throttle is closed, and it will be close to closed at such a low RPM, you could potentially be making your engine work more to maintain speed than you would be if you were in a lower gear. This would mean you wouldn't be driving at optimum fuel efficiency. Of course, this depends on your car and many other factors, so there's no way to be sure being in 5th gear is worse for your fuel economy than being in 4th gear at such a low speed. If I had to guess, you will still be getting better fuel economy in 5th gear at 1,000 RPM.</p>

<p>When in doubt, to maximize fuel efficiency, use as high a gear as you can manage for the power required.</p>

"What is the function of a blow-off valve vs a wastegate?","32011","","<p>I am waiting for a 2013 STI and have been looking into upping the performance, but before I go down that road I would like to thoroughly understand the components in a forced induction vehicle.</p>

<p>I've done a bit of reading but I'm still confused as to the difference between a blow-off valve and a wastegate. These two components seem to do the same job ie. prevent too much boost/pressure from being created. From what I understand, the BOV releases air if the PSI gets past a certain point and the wastegate prevents exhaust gases from spooling the turbine past a certain pressure. Am I missing something? I'm sure I am. Could someone please clarify for me?</p>
","<p>The waste gate is designed (as you'll see in Bob's excellent answer to his linked question) to avoid spinning the turbo up unless needed. This saves fuel and wear.</p>

<p>The blow off valve or dump valve is designed to stop a compression wave passing back into the turbo when you close the throttle, as this wave could stall the turbo completely, which can put high stress on the turbo, as well as making it take a long time to spin back up again (turbo lag)</p>

"If one coil spring needs replacing, do I need to replace both?","31708","","<p>I just had my car serviced and they discovered that the front, near side coil spring is ""incomplete"" and needs replacing. I'm getting conflicting advice about whether I need to replace both front springs at the same time, or whether it's OK to just replace the one that's failed.</p>

<p>So - do I need to replace both, or just the one that's failed?</p>
","<p>It is always recommended to replace suspecsion and braking components on both sides of the same axle at the same time, wherever possible.</p>

<p>Both will currently be the same age - if one has failed, it is likely that the other is in a similar condition and so could easily fail soon. In the case of springs, the constant flexing of the metal can eventually lead to fatigue, which is presumably the cause of the first failure - the other spring will be similarly fatigued. Similar arguments apply to other components such as shocks and bushes, which all wear out over time.</p>

<p>Additionally I suspect (although I'm not a metallurgist, so this is just speculation) that the spring rate will change over time and use, so a new spring would be slightly harder than the old one - if that is the case then it would result in uneven handling, which would be very dangerous. This is certainly the case with shock absorbers, which lose their damping ability as they wear - one side well damped and the other not would be deadly!</p>

"Why am I not moving after starting car and shifting to Drive?","31491","","<p>So I have had this issue for the last couple months where when I first start the car, shifting to Drive (automatic transmission) doesn't do anything. Pressing the gas only revs the engine, as if in neutral.  Shifting down to low gears (1 and 2) has the same outcome.  Reverse performs as expected, I can back up with no problem.  Only after a few minutes of idling does the car slowly, almost grudgingly, pull away.  I checked trans fluid and I'm good, and I don't see any leaks.  Since I have been coping with this problem for a while, I did notice a few things.<br>
1. The car will only move once my rpms (while in Drive) drop below 1000.<br>
2. Upon first starting the car and shifting to Drive, I originally idle at about 1500, then as the engine warms I steadily drop until I start to move (below 1000).
3. Revving up to about 4000 rpms decreases the time it takes to ""warm up"" and drop the needle below 1000.</p>

<p>So my questions are (a)what could be the cause? My gears obviously aren't connecting until a certain rpm. Why?
(b) why do I originally idle high, then steadily drop?</p>
","<p>If there is no feeling of moving at all, not even that little lurch forward when things are working correctly, it sounds like your transmission is having a serious issue. Nothing says it's dead, too early for that yet.</p>

<p>When you look at the transmission fluid, what color is it? Does it smell burnt? It should be a nice bright red, and not have the burnt smell. If this is true, you may have a problem with the transmission solenoids, bad vacuum lines, or some other things. That would be good news ans these fixes are relatively inexpensive compared to a transmission rebuild.</p>

<p>If it's not the solenoids, or vacuum lines, you should probably take it in and have it looked at. Find a reputable local shop that specializes in transmissions. This is not something you want the dealer to handle, and if it needs a rebuild, you don't want just any old shop doing it. I had a Cadillac where the transmission was just another consumable.

allow the exhaust to move excessively and strike the under-body of the car when big bumps are hit.</li>

"Do you really need to cool down your turbo after hard driving?","30738","","<p>Vehicle: 2012 Subaru Sti</p>

<p>I have been driving turbocharged cars for a while now and I have blatantly accepted that before shutting down you must let your car idle for a few minutes after driving hard to allow the turbo to cool down. This process will allow you to extend the life of your turbo, however, I must say I have not heard of any scenarios where the turbo on these cars actually gets damaged by not following this process.</p>

<p>Are there any set rules on how long you should let your car idle after driving hard (i.e., keeping the turbo in boost, revving up passed 6000 rpm)? Is letting your car idle before shutting down an effective method for cooling the turbo? I have also used a turbo timer at one point, it may be useful to point out where this device has strengths in this matter.</p>
","<p>Yes, you have to do that. Your turbo heats up to around 900 degrees Celsius under hard driving conditions. When you shut off the car, You suddenly take away the heat source and the ambient temperature falls to around 95 degrees Celsius (the normal operating temperature for a Subaru that has been driven hard). This causes the turbine housing to experience thermal shock. Now granted, it would take a long time for this thermal shock to actually cause damage, but you're probably reducing the turbo's life by putting it under stress unnecessarily. If you let the car idle for a minute or so, you allow the exhaust gas temperatures to gradually go down to 700, 600, 500, etc.</p>

<p>An example to support what I said:
 1. When a cast iron manifold is welded (turbine housing is cast iron too), it is recommended to toss the whole thing into a fire and let it burn out overnight so that the manifold cools down gradually to prevent stress points from forming.</p>

<p>From experience, it's not necessary to let the car idle if you simply drive normally for the last 2 or 3 miles before you shut off the engine. Just never shut the car off <em>immediately</em> after doing a hard pull. E.g. when the cops pull you over on the highway.</p>

The service manual just says to inspect and replace as necessary (as a set).  I don't see anything I can measure to determine if there is any wear?  Obviously there's a point somewhere in between waiting for it to fail and replacing it every time I ride...  :-)</p>
","<p>I got this advice from <a href=""http://www.canyonchasers.net/shop/generic/chain.php"" rel=""nofollow"">this website</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Go to your rear sprocket and pull straight back on the chain. If your chain pulls away from the sprockets by much, it is probably stretched out. If the chain does not pull away and stays right on the sprocket, then the chain is not stretched out yet. Also, if your sprockets no longer look like points but a bunch of little hooks you need to replace it all. Another wear indication is tight links or kinks in the chain. This is caused by a lack of lube that has caused links stick.</p>
  
  <p>The most common way to know if your chain needs to be replaced comes from measuring your slack. As a chain wears, grooves are cut into the pins which gives the illusion of chain-stretch. No chain wears perfectly even so every chain will develop a variance in the chain slack measurement. If the variance between the tight spots and loose spots of the chain become too great, you'll want to replace the chain. If the chain is not replaced at this point, the variances in slack will put a lot of stress on the sprockets. Replace the chain early and most times you can run two chains to one set of sprockets.</p>

"Can OBD-II be used to control the vehicle?","30597","","<p>Is the OBD-II port in vehicles only used for reading diagnostic codes or is there some functionality that allows the vehicle (eg. engine revving) to be controlled through OBD-II?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
","<p>Ultimately the answer is <strong>yes</strong> you can. To qualify this answer, though, you can only control some things, but not all things, then only on some vehicles. You can do simple things through the port, such as turn the A/C pump on, or any other thing which is controlled by the computer (PCM). As an extension, I'm sure you could rev the engine using the same methods as long as the vehicle has a drive by wire (DBW) setup. In a DBW setup, the computer controls the throttle, so with the right hack it could be accomplished. Anything which is controlled by the computer and is not dependent upon a physical means of input (such as changing the gears in the transmission or steering the vehicle which is directly controlled by the steering wheel -- see note below) should be able to be controlled through this means. Mind you, you'd have to have a complete knowledge of how the computer runs in order to program something like this and many manufacturers are deign to allow this information out (mainly to prevent retuning efforts or engine parameters in the computer). Then too, those who <em>have</em> cracked the code on the PCMs aren't to often willing to share this information either ... they don't want to just give away their bread and butter for free.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Some vehicles will be going to a drive by wire system for the steering in the near future. Yes, this means there is no direct connection between the driver and the wheels. Personally I do not like this as it does not lend to safety (if the system should fail, you have no way to steer the vehicle ... and if you don't have power, no way to steer either). They would also have to design in a feedback circuit, because as <a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/15059/what-is-exactly-steering-feedback"">Bob explains here</a>, there is something to be said for feedback while driving.</p>

I'm not a mechanic, please forgive me if I use the wrong terminology.</p>

<p>Within the past two weeks, it has started to act a bit silly and I don't know what's all wrong with it.<br>
It started as little hiccups while driving, not like a surge, but I'd be cruising along and it'd hiccup- a sort of feeling like it didn't fire on a cylinder. One note, I do recall when it started happening that I would smell gasoline for a few minutes after starting it while cold. </p>

<p>Then it got worse and worse with those hiccups. After that it started having a number of other issues, such as power loss, really bad acceleration, stalling, and a really rough idle.<br>
Normally it idles around 950-1050 RPM, what has been happening is that it would start, idle high, around 1500, then drop to normal, and then start sputtering and RPMs would fluctuate anywhere between 750 on the high side, all the way to 0, stalling the motor. If I pressed the accelerator, it would either not affect the RPMs, or it would start to die out. Other times the motor would crank but not start at all.<br>
I took it to an autoparts shop the other day to get some stuff to work on it, when I came out of the shop, it wouldn't start, and I popped open the hood to take a look. I took off the air filter cover, and pulled the throttle a little bit, got some fire/backfire out of the carb.  </p>

<p>I've also had problems where when I would be stopped, put the truck in first gear and try to accelerate, the engine would not want to move, and it would start rocking the entire truck back and forth. and continue all the way up to third gear.</p>

<p>What I've done so far:<br>
- Changed all spark plugs, spark plug wires<br>
- changed the distributor cap and rotor  </p>

<p>I've purchased a fuel filter which I'm going to install tomorrow. Not done that yet because all the times I've worked on it, the exhaust has been hot.  </p>

With these I apply enough pressure on the rubber at the point the hose clamp was attached to hold it without deforming anything underneath, especially if what is underneath happens to be fragile or made of thin metal. If you can get the hose to turn on the pipe, it will pull off of it. It's the adhesion which is formed which you are trying to break to allow it to pop off.</li>
<li>If you don't have the above tool, you can also use a thin flat tipped screwdriver to run around the inside of the hose to break this connection loose.</li>

Pulling it straight off without breaking the seal just <strong><em>will not</em></strong> allow anything to happen without damaging something. When re-installing the pipe, use a little bit of grease (high pressure or whatever ... <strong>not</strong> cooking grease, lol) on the inside. This will help it slide onto the fixture easier, will help it seal better, and when you have to pull it off again, makes it easier to come off.</p>

","<p>In terms of towing, in reality, all you need is enough torque to get over initial resistance, as rolling resistance is much lower. This is why you get people who can tow a bus, or a jumbo jet, for example, so absolute power isn't the be-all and end-all.</p>

Subaru, built by Fuji Heavy Industries, really lives up to the 'heavy industry' part - it is heavily over-engineered, with the engine block, differentials, gearbox and transmission well able to cope with more than the car will normally have to deal with.</p>

<p>As Paulster commented, the actual safe weight towable also depends on the handling and braking characteristics, so while the power of the 3.6l may be much higher, the rest of the car is not much changed (ie same tyres, suspension, brakes, similar weight) so even if you had a much bigger engine you wouldn't be able to tow much more.</p>

"What is overboost?","29897","","<p>I've heard the term overboost quite a lot. </p>

<p>What is ""bad"" overboost? </p>

<p>What is an overboost problem? </p>

<p>What will happen to my turbo engine if I don't fix it?</p>

<p>Edit: apparently there is a good type where the engine produces more power for 5 seconds or so. Why just for say 5 seconds and not all the time? </p>
","<p><strong>tl;dr: Overboost is too much air, usually at too high a temperature.  Detonation is likely to follow.</strong></p>

<p>Remember, the engine is just an <a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/a/2739/57"">air pump</a>.  All the turbo is doing is making it easier for air molecules to get into the intake side of the engine.  Of course, the turbo has finite efficiency: it is pushing in more air molecules but it's also increasing their net energy (i.e., intake air temperature goes up).</p>

<p>The engine needs to add enough fuel molecules to combust with those air molecules.  Because of the increase in air temperature, it sometimes needs to add even more fuel as a coolant (which seems wasteful because it is).  The engine's goal is to make sure that there's just the right air-fuel mixture at just the right temperature to ignite exactly when it's supposed to.</p>

<p>Too much boost (overboost) can lead to two big problems (well, lots of possible problems but let's stay at a fundamental level for now):</p>

<p><strong>Lean is bad:</strong> If you have too little fuel for too much air, you have a lean condition.  In this situation, the fuel-air mixture is actually easier to ignite with increasing temperatures (e.g., under boost).  In fact, it can sometimes suddenly ignite due to hot spots in the cylinder or just the fact that the whole mixture is above <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_energy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">its activation energy</a>.</p>

<p>Quoting Corky Bell of <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/305998.Maximum_Boost"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Maximum Boost</a> fame:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Any misfires at full throttle induced by a lean condition are serious
  and must be dealt with prior to operating at that boost level again. 
  A lack of fuel raises chamber temperatures dramatically.  Heat is the
  cause of detonation, which is the nemesis of high performance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The consequence is that the mixture in the cylinder ignites at the wrong time.  This cause all kinds of bad mechanical problems, sounds awful, can break your engine and definitely doesn't make you feel speedy.  </p>

<p>Terminal detonation is exactly what it sounds like: critical pieces of the engine itself explode away.</p>

<p><strong>Too much energy is bad:</strong> It's possible to have too much energy in the system even when things are going ""perfectly.""  Imagine a theoretical system where your turbo is 100% efficient (adds no heat during compression), your fueling system can pump in arbitrary amounts of fuel and your engine computer can keep up with all the demands.  Even in that highly imaginary situation, if you put enough energy in the cylinder, it's going to break.  The fundamental structural components of the system will eventually fail given enough stress.  </p>

<p>In real life, such a perfect system is rare to impossible given our finite budgets.  However, ...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>apparently there is a good type where the engine produces more power
  for 5 seconds or so. Why just for say 5 seconds and not all the time?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The answer is math</strong> (specifically probability).  This sort of feature is most useful in auto racing where the driver needs that little extra edge to make the critical pass.  They're trading a burst of energy for an increase in system temperature, net strain on the engine and briefly increased risk of total system failure.  Roll the dice and hope it doesn't come up snake eyes during that five seconds.</p>

<p>In a race, that's often a reasonable trade-off.  Obviously, those of us driving on the street are usually operating without the benefit of an auto-racing team's budget.</p>

<p>Funnily enough, <strong>overboost is usually straightforward to correct</strong>.  It's almost certainly a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wastegate"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wastegate</a> problem: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A wastegate is a valve that diverts exhaust gases away from the
  turbine wheel in a turbocharged engine system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By diverting exhaust gases away, the engine computer can hold the turbine to a peak speed.  As a consequence, the compressor side will also be limited to a peak boost.  If something happens to keep the wastegate from functioning as needed, your turbo is going to try to keep accelerating up to infinity.</p>

<p>As we have discussed, it isn't going to get there.  Boom!</p>

"Why is plexiglass not used for car windows?","29836","","<p>Back in 2014 someone broke the right side window of my VW Golf.</p>

<p>I was in a hurry and short on cash so I ""temporarily"" cut a 4 or 5mm thick piece of plexiglass ($8), bent it with hot air and placed it in my car thinking that a few weeks later when it will be worn out I would replace it with a proper window.</p>

<p>It's been closing in two years and it is still crystal clear (which is why I kinda forgot about it), though with microscratches if you look really close. Still transparent as ever.</p>

<p>I'm bringing this up because yesterday two guys on a bike attempted to steal my briefcase. Stopped right next to me on a red light and one of them tried to smash through the glass with a hammer. The tool bounced right off the window and hit the driver of the bike on the helmet. They almost fell and fled ungracefully.</p>

<p>For a very long time I thought that plexiglass is not fit for automotive purposes but now I am reconsidering.</p>

<p>Apart from the windshield (which would degrade faster due to direct impact of microparticles), what do you think are the reasons that plexiglass is not considered for car windows?</p>
","<p>Plexiglass is flammable. While it <a href=""http://www.plexiglas.net/product/plexiglas/en/about/faq/Pages/fire-behavior.aspx#faq_0_0"">doesn't release</a> toxic gases or excessive amounts of smoke, it is still rated B2 (normally flammable) and thus forbidden as interior material in motor vehicles, including windows.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/49/571.302"">Here</a> is a relevant US standard if you're interested in details.</p>

<p>Collision behaviour mentioned by Thomas is also a crucial property, especially for bigger pieces like windows. If that guy on a bike had a bigger hammer, he could have popped your window inside the vehicle, where its shards would have released their kinetic energy by hurting the driver and the passengers. The same thing could have happened on a side collision with another car.</p>

"Noise in stereo that changes pitch with engine RPM","29803","","<p>This is a question of curiosity. I have a '98 Acura Integra, a cheap car stereo with a 3.5mm aux in, <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0065NLQ1I"">a cheap inverter</a> and a smart phone. If I have the smart phone audio hooked up to the car stereo and the inverter charging the phone I get a high pitched tone through the speakers at around 4k RPM that increases in pitch with the RPM of the engine.</p>

<p>I know the solution is to not use the inverter, there is no reason to be doing that, but I'm curious why the pitch of the noise fluctuates with the engine RPM. Shouldn't the output of that DC outlet be mostly consistent?</p>
","<p>Most of the time a ground loop is the cause of this problem. This problem is common especially if your stereos speakers are amplified, and can be fixed my making sure that your stereo unit and/or amplifier have a good ground connection. This can be done by either finding a more direct ground connection to the cars frame, sanding the area around your ground connection to remove any rust or paint that could be adding grounding resistance, or even running a ground wire from your stereo or amp directly to your battery.</p>

<p>In fact, it is most likely that you are constantly experiencing the whining sound. With the engine idling if you put your ear up to the speaker you will probably hear the sound, it just doesn't become noticeable until higher revs.</p>

"2009 Toyota Camry 2AZFE idle vibration remains after new motor mounts","29711","","<p>My wife's Camry went in to the shop 2 months ago for a rough idle. We bought the car used in February with 72K miles. We've put on 10K and decided to have a mechanic look it over and tell us what it needed. The shop noted the engine left and right engine mounts were broken and suggested we change them (for $600). I decided I could do this job and save a few bucks.</p>

<p>So, yesterday I replaced the three mounts underneath the engine with toyota factory parts from the dealer. Also replaced the dogbone up top. Four mounts replaced. The problem now is that the vibration has changed. The car used to have a pretty steady vibration, most notable at idle in gear. It would also lurch when accelerating from a stop. Now the lurch is gone and the car feels smoother while driving and the lurching from a stop is gone. </p>

<p>But, I only have vibration when at a stop and the car is in drive. Putting it in reverse, neutral or park and no vibration. I can also kind of feel the same frequency vibration when I turn the car to the left. It makes no sense to me. Tonight I cleaned the throttle body as detailed here: <a href=""http://www.toyotanation.com/forum/104-5th-6th-generation-2002-2006-2007-2011/420994-diy-2azfe-throttle-cleaning-gen-5-gen-5-5-gen-6-a.html"">DIY 2AZFE Throttle Cleaning Gen 5, Gen 5.5, Gen 6</a> - no change on the idle.  </p>

<p>I pulled the wheels off and jacked it up and got under it and looked everywhere while having my wife put it in drive and hold the brake. Engine is vibrating a good bit, but the mounts look fine.</p>

<p>I can't figure out if it has anything to do with the engine mounts now... Did I do something wrong or is something making the engine run rough at low speed? Did I get a defective mount? How can I troubleshoot this? I'm scared to take it to the mechanic and go on an expensive goose chase after already spending $400 on mounts alone. Any suggestions are welcome!</p>
","<p>Most likely, one of the engine mounts are 'torqued'. You can try and neutralize the mounts. Loosen the through bolts of all mounts several (4-5) turns. Then start the car, and drive back and forth several feet (using quick taps on the gas and not just idling) over and over, and let it rest at idle a few seconds before turning off the engine. Now tighten all mounts being careful not to rock the motor, and don't pry or push anything to reach the bolts! (This is where swivels come in handy)</p>

"Why do heavy vehicles almost always use diesel engines?","29534","","<p>I have always wondered why heavy vehicles such as large trucks and buses almost always use diesel engines, whereas in light cars there is a choice between diesel and gasoline engines.</p>

<p>Engine efficiency might explain the preference towards diesel engines, but then again isn't this a valid consideration also in light cars? You should get better efficiency with a diesel engine, and therefore, all cars should use diesel engines.</p>

<p>So, why do large vehicles almost always use diesel engines, but light cars have a choice between gasoline and diesel?</p>

<p>Could modern technology such as hybrid technology with Atkinson cycle bring gasoline engines to large vehicles as well? I have read that the Atkinson cycle engine in 2016 Toyota Prius has 40% thermal efficiency. This is very diesel-like in my opinion and if the technology is scaled up, could help bring gasoline technology to large vehicles.</p>
","<p>Torque is the name of the game. High torque is needed to move heavy loads. If comparing a gasoline engine to a comparable diesel engine the diesel will always have higher torque. The higher torque comes from the need for a higher compressing ratio needed for compression ignition. To achieve the higher compression ratio a longer stroke is required. The longer stroke comes from a greater crankshaft offset. This offset gives greater torque.</p>

<p>Another aspect is that diesels can make tremendous torque at very low RPM. Very simply put more fuel equals more torque when everything else is kept the same. A diesel  does not have throttle plates and draws in the maximum amount of air on every stroke. In a diesel the amount of fuel added is what controls the power. The throttle controls how much fuel is added. This means that a diesel always runs lean. At idle the engine uses hardly any fuel. This lean mixture allows for the addition of large quantities of fuel even at low RPM. A gasoline engine on the other hand always has to keep the fuel mixture at optimal stoichiometric. This need to keep the mixture correct means that to get more fuel the engine needs to rev to higher RPMs. This means that a gasoline engine makes it's torque at much higher RPM than a diesel. This high end torque characteristic makes a gasoline engine hard to drive necessitating constantly keeping the RPM high. </p>

<p>The only real draw back to this torque production is a limited RPM. This is compensated by a gear box with lots and lots of gears. </p>

<p>If a gasoline engine was used it would have to be much larger. The much larger engine would make for greater fuel consumption. </p>

<p>The nice thing about a question like this is that it isn't up for opinions.  The cost / benefit ratios can be measured.  <a href=""http://grassrootsmotorsports.com/"">Grassroots Motorsports</a> routinely does this sort of analysis.  For example, in <a href=""http://grassrootsmotorsports.com/articles/speed-holes/"">Speed Holes</a> by Per Schroeder (from the Feb. 2008 issue), Per compares a variety of plus-sizes (lower and lower profiles) on the test car (their BMW project car at the time).</p>

<p>Here are some choice quotes that address your pro / con question above (snipped to emphasize but the whole article is online):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here’s a shocker for those hailing
  from the bigger is better camp: The
  18s didn’t win this little comparo.
  For one, the 18-inch wheel and tire

  ride quality on our road loop. ... We’d
  steer away from a setup this radical
  on a daily-driven car.  </p>
  
  <p>... Interestingly, the 18-inch

  <p>There was a

<p>To summarize some of the above: lower profile generally trades ride quality for turning ability, sometimes sacrificing braking due to the increase in wheel mass.  Going too low, though, can push you past the point of losing in all categories.</p>

<p>Note: I meant also to use it for defrosting the car when it is covered in ice, as you can't really drive when you can't see! ;)</p>
","<p>The short answer: Yes, you can rev your engine to make it warm up faster.</p>

<hr>

<p>One big caveat to that answer is that it is <strong>highly</strong> recommended you don't do that. With modern gasoline vehicles, most manufacturers recommend you start the car and immediately start driving. The reasons for this are many, but a couple of the major points:</p>

<ol>
<li>The car will warm up faster by driving it than letting it sit in your driveway for several minutes. Most of the moving parts outside the engine will not be warmed up by idling it in the driveway before you drive, they can only warm up by driving.</li>
<li>Your car will be putting off a lot of pollutants for no reason as it just sits there warming up. It's a waste of fuel for little to no benefit except your comfort.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>This myth is a carry over from the days of carburetors, which did need some warming up before driving.</p>

<p>My recommendation: Put on a jacket or coat and just start your car and gently drive away; it'll warm up in a few minutes. If it's extremely cold out, let it run for maybe 30 seconds before driving. Don't push it too hard until it has warmed up. If you sit there revving the engine to warm it up faster, you might as well be driving because you are going to be putting extra wear and tear on the vehicle by revving it too high while cold.</p>

<p>Brake itself feels fine, responsive and smooth and I've felt the rotor for wear and it feels fine.</p>

<p>Should I be concerned about this at all?</p>
","<p>Most brake pads use some sort of shim or spring to stop the pad from oscillating,aka making noise. What generally causes the noise is a small amount of movement by the pad at a very high frequency. Manufacturers eliminate this with shims,springs or a soft material that acts as a dampener. It is possible that one of these has failed from time,use or enviromental exposure. Another possibility is the pads are contaminated with oil splashed up from the road.The pad material is a blend or compounds that offer different traits in terms of wear,stopping power,noise etc. You may have a pad in which the material was not blended evenly and you are encountering hard spots that is causing the squeal. Another possibility is that the pads are equipped with a wear sensor. This is a small metal tab attached to the pad that rubs on the rotor when the pad is worn to the minimum usable thickness. The tab will rub at all speeds but may be audible only at slower speeds.  </p>

"Is it normal both TPMS sensors fail just after changing tires?","28986","","<p>I had the rear pair of tires of my 2006 Toyota Prius changed recently. Both were already bald and one was also leaky. The Tire Pressure Measure Sensors were pointing correctly that the leaky tire would lose pressure after about 5 days it was filled and the light would disappear after the tire was filled with the correct pressure.</p>

<p>I decided to change both rear tires since they actually needed to be replaced anyway, instead of fixing only the leaky tire. Just after the tires were replaced the tire shop owner asked me if the TPMS light was on all the time before I brought the car to him and I told him that this would happen only when the tire had a low pressure. He showed me using a device that apparently reads the TPMS sensors that both rear TPMS sensors had low battery and needed to be replaced for $50 each. I said that I would not replace since they were working fine all this time and hoped that this was only due to the change and the light would go out after a few days, but it keeps on all the times, sometimes even blinking.</p>

<p>I think that it is really a big coincidence that only the TPMS sensors on the new tires failed exactly on the day the tires were replaced. Is that normal the TPMS sensors fail upon tire change or I just happened to run into a very unlikely situation? Could the TPMS sensors had been replaced by nonfunctional ones by the tire shop to try to sell me new ones? He didn't allow me to see the car being serviced (even when I asked so), so that made me suspicious.</p>
","<p>Sounds like an indirect TPMS.  These can be easily damaged by tire-mounting machines.  If one or both are damaged, you can get dash light staying on.  If they're not damaged, sometimes they just need a reset, especially if you don't change all tires at once.  Indirect sytems test revolutions, not pressure.  So it will sense a problem if 2 front tires have more wear than 2 new back tires.  Reset procedures vary, sometimes you need a scan tool.  You have be sure all 4 tires have the correct pressure before resetting for wear.  If you have a driver display interface, sometimes they can be reset from the menu.  Like Fred Wilson said, the batteries do wear out after 10 years, +/-.  But, like you, I also think that's way too coincidental.  I'd get a second opinion to make sure they're not damaged, check all pressures and see if they can be reset.  Indirect TPMS will be on valve stems or attached to a wheel's drop center.  Good luck! </p>

<p>Edit for your questions in the comment section.  It wouldn't let me put this as just a comment so I had to edit my answer instead.  Let me ask a couple of questions.  Can you confirm if it's an indirect sytem for me?  When you say it flashes sometimes, how so?  Does it flash like 3 times and go solid again?  How often?  Does the ABS light come on?  When they showed you the device, how do you actually know the fault was low batteries?  What did it say or look like specifically?  Also, some models have a reset button under steering column where your knees are.  Look to see- do you have a reset button?  If so, don't touch it yet, just let me know.  Did you check the tire pressure on all 4 wheels yourself to make sure they're correct?   It's possible you can use an OBD2 code reader to erase faults but, if you could, I'd like to know what the fault codes are if you do use it.  It should connect to the instrument panel.  A light on your dash can be from some type of damage and will give a code.  Sometimes a relearn process needs to be done by the service technician after servicing your tires.  If it's not done or done incorrectly that could also cause a fault. </p>

<p>Edit for additional comment questions: Is your reader wireless as well?  More details on how you did your reset- something like, held it in for 3 or 4 seconds and the tpms light blinked?  Is that about right?  How long did it blink for, how many times, how quickly?  The lowbat indicator you spoke of: that was from the serviceman's wireless tpms tool, right?  He came to the front to show you this AFTER the work was done?  Odd that he wouldn't scan each sensor FIRST to get info on them, including preexisting faults and to get their custom ID's so they know how the ECU recognizes them.  Can you give me a little more detail about when your tpms light blinks?  Only on startup? While driving anytime at all?  If so, what details can you give me about that?  If your OBD2 reader is wireless, you should be able to verify codes for low batteries or anything else yourself.  Have you?  Lastly, the ECU stores where each sensor is for each tire.  It may be worth a try swapping the back two tires, filling them to spec and redoing the reset (just in case they swapped those two wheels by accident when they were doing the work).  On a side note, those trouble codes you did mention- P0420 and P0116 together indicate you should check your coolant temp sonsor with a multimeter to see if it's bad or check your thermostat. </p>

<p>Updated edit: Most direct systems have some way of knowing what tire's sensor it's reading from.  Sometimes it's by unique SN's or ID's, sometimes it's specially placed antennae that detect directional rotation; but, the point is, the two back sensors could have been mixed up.  Which would be fine if a resynchronization is done (recalibrating the transponders).  What you did with the reset button was reset the tire pressure baseline.  I heard at some point that some models need a wireless tool to resync with Toyota models.  If you did the pressure reset correctly- Hold the button with the ignition on (not car on) until the tpms light blink 3 times, then leave ignition on for a few minutes before shutting it off- then it sounds like you did it right.  Since that didn't work, I would try swapping the two back tires to see if ID's were out of place.  Lastly, bring your car into a different tire service place to explain the situation.  Ask if they can try resynchronization first, since you suspect it may not have been done.  Then ask if they can get any trouble codes to verify low battery on BOTH sensors.  Maybe they'd be willing to look and make sure nothing was damaged like an antenna or seal...   Finally, if none of that works out and their codes match low batteries, 'I guess' that's it but would be very coincidental for even just one to suddenly have become just low enough at the time of servicing one tire, let alone both!  </p>

<p>Regarding the other codes- the ECS can be tested with a multimeter.  An auto part store should have spec values for that or your manual.  If your thermostat is stuck open, you'll feel coolant running through the upper radiator hose upon initial startup (it shouldn't open until it warms up a bit so you shouldn't feel fluid running yet).  It'll also take longer than normal for your heat to start working and your engine to warm up.  If it's stuck closed, your engine will run hotter than normal and overheat.  Those two codes you got could also just be from letting your coolant level get too low at some point.  Clear them out and keep an eye on your engine temp.  If you get any warning signs then you can see if you get those codes again.  If so, one of them is probably defective.  Sorry I couldn't be more help. Good luck.  </p>

"Optimal RPM range for manual transmission","28943","","<p>Are there optimal RPM ranges for different vehicles? I've been told it's better for the engine to drive at slightly higher RPMs (e.g. 2500-3000 for my Tacoma) than low (1000-1500). </p>

<p>I understand a lot depends on the gear sizing and ratios for different trannies. E.g. the ratio between my 1st and 2nd gears is quite large so that, the RPM drop between those two speeds is almost 1000. That means, to avoid lugging when shifted into 2nd, I need to rev 1st up to almost 3000 RPM, which results in a less-than-pleasant engine noise.</p>

<p>Is there an optimal RPM range for all speeds, which improves the engine longevity or is it speed specific? IOW, is it less bad to be lugging in lower speeds than higher?</p>

<p>As a bonus question, can you explain why higher RPMs are better than lower, in terms of engine health, performance and fuel efficiency?</p>
","<p>It is in fact true that driving at slightly (key word) higher rpms is much better (for both fuel efficiency and engine life. The rpm range for the two can be different). </p>

<p>Part 1. Engine life:</p>

<p>Every engine has a least resonant rpm. This is when your engine vibrates the least (Think of this as the opposite of that point when your entire car begins to shake violently due to excess load). Since the vibration is minimum at this rpm, the wear and tear in the engine is minimized and so is the friction between engine components. This naturally means you have parts that run smoother and longer. This can also increase your fuel efficiency since frictional power loss is minimized. </p>

<p>Part 2.Optimal fuel efficiency:</p>

<p>This rpm range need not be the same as that for optimal engine life. Your fuel efficiency is best when you are not over working the car. This has multiple dimensions to it. Ideally, driving the car at a high gear, just shy of the midway mark on your tachometer is when the fuel efficiency is the maximum (i.e. when you are cruising) but if you demand acceleration you will burn a lot of fuel to get very little. This type of driving is best for the highway. In the city limits, it would be best to raise the engine to the sweet-spot (where the resonance is the least) and then shift to drop the rpm back down, all the while not being aggressive with the pedal.</p>

<p>Low rpms give you better efficiency for two reasons, </p>

<ol>
<li>Dynamic friction is proportional to speed. (Higher the speed, greater the friction). This applies everywhere, from the crank shaft to the piston-cylinder to the gearbox. A car can rev only so much because after a certain point, the power generated is  less than that needed to overcome the frictional force.</li>
</ol>

<p>Bottom line: Lower the speed, better the efficiency.</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>Volumetric efficiency. (Higher the speed, lower the volumetric efficiency) At low engine speeds, as the engine goes through the exhaust stroke and the suction stroke, air can easily exit and fill the engine cylinder. As the engine rpm increase it becomes harder and harder for the burnt air fuel mixture to exit the cylinder (in the exhaust stroke) and for the fresh air to enter the cylinder (in the suction stroke). This translates to wastage of power because the engine has to use some of the power generated to push the air out faster and faster. On the suction stroke, the air does not travel fast enough to fill the cylinder in the short duration that the intake valve is open. 
(To make matters worse, the ECU measures the pressure at the inlet and expects a certain amount of air to enter the engine and adjusts the fuel injected accordingly, but when the expected amount of air does not enter the engine, the fuel that would otherwise have been burnt gets wasted.)</li>
</ol>

<p>Bottom Line: Lower the speed, better the efficiency.</p>

<p>Now, remember the least resonance rpm? Remember how coming closer and closer to that rpm, reduces frictional loses? This is around half way through your rev range. Hence you will get the best fuel efficiency when you are in the proximity of least resonance but low enough to take advantage of points 1 and 2. 
For easier understanding, look at this graph:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/woZuU.gif"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/woZuU.gif"" alt=""This curve denotes the fuel consumption at different engine speeds""></a></p>

<p>The above graph is for an engine on a test bed. For an engine on a car, the lowest point is a little to the left at around 2500 rpm (just like you stated).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Screw the explanation, give me the answer:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For best fuel efficiency:</p>

<p>When driving on the highway, drive just shy of the midway mark. In the city, rev all the way up to the sweet-spot and then shift up to comeback to just shy of the mid way mark.</p>

<p>For best engine life:</p>

<p>Do what you must to stay at the sweet spot.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How to find the sweet spot:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1.Park the car (handbrake is engaged)</p>

<p>2.Start the engine, put it in second or third gear. </p>

<p>3.While keeping the clutch depressed, raise the engine in steps of about 250rpm (Smaller steps if you are really particular). </p>

<p>4.At a very exact rpm, the car will feel like it is running smoother than usual.</p>

<p>5.Congratulations. You have found the ""sweet-spot"".</p>

<pre><code>(PS. This is harder than it sounds, but I encourage you to do it!)

(Disclaimer: Sweet-spot is not a universally understood term, 
when searching online or talking to your car buddies, use the term 
""Point of least resonance"".)

"Best way to remove rust from brake calipers without removing wheel","28911","","<p>I have rang a few garages but none offer to remove rust from brake calipers, a lot of people say it is going to rust around there a bit anyway but I wanted to make them look shiny new for when I give my car as a gift to a relative. The rotor is nice and clean but I just need to get the brake caliper outside unit clean, I don't want to take the wheel off.</p>

<p>Who can do this kind of job? Is there a brush or product I can buy to clean them?</p>
","<p>If you want it to look nice/new/fresh/exciting, you will not be able to get it this way without removing the wheel. There is just no way of completely cleaning/coating the caliper without removing the wheel. Your best bet to get them cleaned up is to: </p>

<ol>
<li>Remove the wheel</li>
<li>Pull the caliper from it's mount</li>
<li>Remove the pads (keeping them in positional order for proper replacement)</li>
<li>Take a wire brush to it to knock as much of the rust off as possible</li>
<li>Blow the caliper clean of debris with some high pressure air</li>
<li>Mask any areas of the caliper/car/rotor/whatever, so as to avoid overspray on these areas</li>
<li>Spray the caliper with hi-temp primer</li>
<li>Allow to dry to tacky (probably about 10 minutes)</li>
<li>Spray the caliper with your color choice of hi-temp paint</li>
<li>Wait until completely dry, then re-assemble</li>
</ol>

<p>What it comes down to is you can either have a good looking caliper, or a half-arsed job - it's up to you. Without taking the wheel off of the vehicle, you WILL have the latter.</p>

<p>If you are actually talking about the rotors and not the calipers (or both), your best bet is to replace the old rotors with ones which are zinc coated. This will maintain a nice appearance in the non-wear areas for a long time to come. This still entails removing the wheel, though.</p>

"Battery light comes on after starting the car. How big of a problem is this?","28896","","<p>On my way to work this morning, the battery light came on. I would say it was about 2-3 minutes after I started the car. My drive to work is only a 10 minutes drive, and the light was on the whole time.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it's Christmas Eve and I have to drive 10 hours to get to my family's house, every auto shop is closed until after the holiday.</p>

<p>How big of a problem is this? I'm planning on letting my car run for an hour or so after work to see if the battery drains out completely (Is that long enough to test if the alternator isn't working?). Is there anything I can do tonight too make sure the car doesn't fall apart? I know it's a terrible idea to drive it with the alternator probably busted, but I really don't have any options. I do have a portable battery pack to jump-start it if I need to.</p>

<p>The car is a <a href=""http://www.cars.com/dodge/neon/2000/"" rel=""nofollow"">2000 Dodge Neon</a>.</p>
","<p>It will have to be fixed before you drive it very far. If the battery light is on the alternator is not charging, your not going to make it very far before the battery goes dead. Your local parts store will be able to test the alternator on the car, most if not all will do it for free. Based on the battery light I am confident it's the alternator, but checking it never hurts.</p>

<p>If you can change the alternator yourself you may still be able to get one if you act fast. Most part stores here are open until 6 tonight. If you can't change it yourself I am not sure you will get it repaired before Thursday. You can try some of the Towing companies that have garages as well. Because of the towing running 24/7 most usually have someone that can repair cars available even on holidays.</p>

<p>You can also check the wires going to the alternator, you will have to jack up the car because it's on the back side of the engine on the bottom. Make sure the small wire is connected to the alternator, I recently had one of these cars that the wire fell off so the alternator wasn't getting the charge signal from the PCM. It takes about an hour to change the alternator with the car on a lift, so maybe 1.5 - 2 hours if your doing it with jack stands and don't have the best assortment of tools. It might be a pain but you should be able to do it with a basic tool assortment.</p>

<ol>
<li>Disconnect the negative battery cable</li>
<li>Loosen the jam nut and the adjustment bolt. Regular wrenches will work for this but a 1/4 inch drive or a stubby 3/8 drive ratchet will make it easier.</li>
<li>Raise the vehicle and support it on jack stands. You can get away with only jacking up the passenger side.</li>
<li>Remove the accessory drive splash shield, ratchet works best.</li>
<li>Loosen the lower mounting bolt</li>
<li>Remove the belt, I would usually tell you to replace the belt while you are there but it's behind another belt so it will add extra time you may not have.</li>
<li>Disconnect the small wire going the the alternator. This is the wire to initially check to make sure it's hooked up.</li>
<li>Disconnect the big wire on the back of the alternator. <strong>Make sure you did step one before doing this!</strong></li>
<li>Remove the upper and lower mounting bolt and move the alternator off the pivot bracket</li>

"How to extend the life of the dual mass flywheel in a diesel engine?","28807","","<p>I am looking for ways to improve the life of the dual mass flywheel (DMF) in my 2005 Ford Focus tdci. I have heard that they can wear out quite quickly on the Ford Focus if they are driven in city conditions a lot, i.e. running on low revs and lots of stop-start driving.</p>

<p>Like a lot of people I spend 15 minutes sitting still in traffic most days, so I am trying to think of ways to improve my driving style to reduce the wear on the DMF. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>I understand that at low revs a diesel engine puts a lot of strain on the DMF because it is running less smooth, however is there much wear on the DMF when you are sitting idle in neutral in traffic? Surely there wouldnt be much strain on the engine, so not much strain on the DMF also?</p></li>
<li><p>When you're running at low speeds in traffic and the revs are down around 1000rpm and the engine seems to be under strain and so could be straining the DMF, would it be better to drive faster at say 1500 rpm and then coast in neutral and then go back to 1500rpm when you're slowing down? Or to just stay driving consistently at 1000rpm? </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I suppose it just goes to show that diesels aren't meant for city driving!</p>
","<p>Reading around a bit on the dual mass clutch the friction plate between the two masses is the component that will often wear out as it is designed to keep from too much torque being sent through to the transmission, taking the hit itself instead (choice between burning up a couple hundred dollar flywheel or a transmission in the thousands of dollars).</p>

<p>Sitting idle in neutral, you are not putting the system under load and so that should not be creating wear.</p>

<p>Any time you press and then release the clutch pedal, you are disengaging the clutch disc from the flywheel and then re-engaging it.  This causes wear on the clutch disc and flywheel.</p>

<p>The time you are going to put the most strain on the friction plate is during acceleration (that is when the most force is exerted onto the drivetrain) so I would suggest keeping a steady speed over speeding up, coasting, speeding up, coasting.</p>

","<p>As a general rule, high pressure hoses will have crimped connections on them. The small clamp connectors are on the pump feed and return hoses, which are low pressure lines. They typically don't leak as often as the high pressure ones do. The high pressure line, according to the diagram you posted, comes from the PS pump and enters the rack. There is a rubber section of this hose that may have leaks forming at crimp connections. There are also two high-pressure solid metal lines connecting one end of the rack to the other. They can leak at the connections as well.</p>

<p>I would clean as much as I could reach. Wind and turbulence can do weird things to leaks at speed, and will typically splatter fluid everywhere making it hard to determine where the leak is coming from.</p>

<p>If it is a fast leak, have someone operate the steering lock-to-lock (turn all the way one way, then all the way to the other) while you look under the car for a new leak forming.</p>

<p>If it's slow, clean it the same, but you'll just have to check every so often to see where the fluid starts near.</p>

"AC sytem repair after bad compressor","28442","","<p>I had my AC compressor removed and replaced with a dummy pulley about a year ago. The reason was I had a long trip ahead of me and the compressor was making some funny noises, as if she was about to blow. I'd like to go ahead and put in a new compressor and have the system re-charged, however I'd like to make sure I don't set my new compressor up  for failure. I am passingly familiar with the need to replace additional components in the system after a bad compressor, i.e. some sort of filter, as well as the need to flush the system, in order to remove foreign debris that will damage the new compressor.</p>

<p>I would like to know a few things:</p>

<pre><code>1. Is it legal for a DIYer to attempt this sort of repair?
2. What are all of the components that need to be
   replaced to prevent problems down the line?
3. Can I complete the repair myself, or do I need a
   professional to perform the actual recharge of the system?
</code></pre>

<p>I am quite adept at automotive repairs, and don't mind attempting one that is a little more involved. I currently live in the Detroit metropolitan area, though I will be moving to the DC metro area shortly, if there any difference in legality between the two locations. The lines were capped when the dummy pulley was installed.</p>
","<ol>
<li><p>As stated in the comments, the legality depends on your location, as well as type of refrigerant used in the system.  R-12 is only available to professionals, where as R-134a is available at your parts store.  If for some reason that R-134a is not available in your area, that would be a good indication that it is illegal there.</p></li>
<li><p>This is alot harder to answer as it depends on your specific vehicle, as well as how the previous compressor failed.  If the compressor clutch failed (this would be the pulley and engagement mechanism at the front of the compressor), then you would only need to replace the compressor, and either the receiver/dryer or accumulator (you will only have one of these).  I would also recommend you replace the orifice tube if your system has one, simply because it is an inexpensive part that can become clogged.  Note that replacing the orifice tube is optional. You could also skip flushing the system and would not need to install an aftermarket filter (I don't like them anyway as they introduce more places for leaks to develop,but they do serve a purpose).</p>

<p>If the compressor was failing internally, it likely dumped a significant amount of debris into the system and this is where your headache starts.  I will break up the repair depending of the type of system you have; either receiver/dryer and expansion valve, or accumulator and orifice tube.  Note that for both systems, replacement of the condenser may be required as some designs have proven difficult/impossible to properly flush.  Unfortunately, that needs to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.  If your system was still functional before you removed the compressor, that could be a good sign.</p>

<p>Receiver/dryer and expansion valve:  The parts would include compressor, receiver/dryer, mandatory flush(es), possibly the condenser, and possibly a filter.  The replacement of the expansion valve can be necessary also.  In this type of system, the receiver/dryer is between the compressor and the expansion valve, and therefore will catch some of the debris.  Note about the flushes:  You would want to disconnect the expansion valve before flushing as you do not want to get debris inside it.  That would make it stop working and require replacement.  When you are disconnecting the expansion valve, if you see debris, then the likelihood of needing replacement goes up.</p>

<p>Accumulator and orifice tube:  The parts would include compressor, accumulator, orifice tube, mandatory flush(es), possibly the condenser, and possibly a filter. In this type of system, the orifice tube will become clogged with debris.</p>

<p>Note for both types of systems:  There are some vehicle specific kits that have all of the o-rings needed for your system(and the some extras).  I would recommend trying to find one of these for your vehicle.  Also, don't forget that the compressor and receiver/dryer or accumulator store oil and that oil must be replenished in the new system WITH THE PROPER TYPE AND QUANTITY or your new compressor will die due to a lack of lubrication.</p></li>
<li><p>Assuming you can get the needed refrigerant, there are still some tools you likely don't have.  The first would be a vacuum pump.  That is used to pull moisture from the system before charging it as any moisture will cause system failure.  One of the reasons for replacing the receiver/dryer or accumulator is because they contain desiccant which removes moisture from the system.  I have seen systems recharged without pulling the vacuum first, but I won't recommend it.  Also, some of the fittings require rather large wrenches so check those sizes as well.  You may also need flare-nut wrenches for the expansion valve fittings.  The A/C system  is not the place for channel-locks, vise-grips, or pipe wrenches and if the fittings look corroded, removal can be difficult.  Finally, an air-compressor would go along ways towards blowing out any debris in the lines.</p>

<p>For parts replacement, since the system does not have any pressure on it, if you can change an alternator and water pump, and have access to the above needed tools,  this should be okay for you to attempt.  Follow the directions for the flush, and replace all o-rings on any fitting that you touch.  Also, if any fitting looks like it has been leaking a bit of oil, replace those o-rings as well.  Once you get the system put back together, you can take it somewhere for the final charging and leak testing.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you are still reading after all of that, as a previous ASE Master Tech, I never liked doing AC work because of all of the things that may be wrong.  I didn't like taking an estimate to the customer that was full of what may be wrong with the vehicle, but at the same time, you couldn't price in all of the maybe's because you would price yourself out of the job.</p>

<p>As a final note, if your system still had freon in it, I should point out that the intentional venting of CFC's and HCFC's  during the maintenance, service, repair, or disposal of air-conditioning or refrigeration equipment is a violation of federal law.</p>

<p>Is this a really bad habit, I only feather it when im moving slowly in say....traffic jams, or drive throughs and such.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>Lugging an engine is like hammering the engine parts with every explosion in a cylinder. It racks on the rod bearing/journals, makes the pistons slap the side of the cylinders hard, and if is done enough, could probably break piston rings. It also creates a hammer effect all the way through the drivetrain. There are springs in the friction disk (of the clutch) which takes up some of this hammering, but they will only take so much before they wear out as well. This causes premature wear all the way around. It's not like it will wear out tomorrow, but it will cause wear over time. If you want your car to last a while, you don't want to be doing this. </p>

<p>I think the major problem with what you are doing is, you aren't doing it right. It sounds like you are just trying to take off from a stop (or slow roll) without revving the engine at all. You should bring the engine up in rpm to around 1500 to 2000 rpm when starting to slip the clutch. You should get used to slipping the clutch in either situation (stopped or slow roll) no matter where you are at. To get it down, you should press on the pedals like you would a bicycle. Basically, as you press on one, you should allow the other to come up, so: gas pedal down slightly while allowing the clutch pedal to come out; and visa-versa - clutch pedal down while allowing the gas pedal to come out. Over time and experience, this becomes second nature. You will figure out (mainly by feel) where the engine needs to be at in speed in order to get the car moving. This will keep you from lugging the engine at all.</p>

<p>EDIT: Here is an <a href=""https://youtu.be/soJea7xEt-8"" rel=""nofollow"">Engineering Explained video</a> about lugging your engine and why it's bad. He gets a lot more technical than I did above, adds to what I've said, but it definitely concurs with it (I believe). </p>

"How will I know clutch pads need replacing?","28188","","<p>I have a manual shift honda civic.</p>

<p>How would I or the motor mechanic know that the clutch pads need replacing?</p>

<p>Would they check it during oil change? Certainly you don't open the transmission box to check the clutch pads during an oil change.</p>

<p>How long would they usually last under normal usage? Do they even wear out?</p>
","<p>The life of the clutch all depends on how it's driven. A clutch driven in the hills of San Francisco is not going to last nearly as long as one driven on the plains of Texas. Yes, the pads do wear out over time. It usually isn't hard to tell when they start to go. You will notice more slippage when taking off from a stop. You might also have a smell which some would say smells like fried chicken. One way to tell specifically is during acceleration. The sound of the engine should be linear ... As the speed of the engine goes up, so should the speed of the car. If you ever find that the engine speeds up, but the car doesn't seem to be speeding up along with it, it's probably going out. You might especially notice this if going up a hill. The guys at the Jiffy Lube are not going to be able to tell if the clutch is going out, as there isn't a place you can see this wear without taking it all apart. You have to drive it to know. If you feel your clutch is going out, find a friend who is a mechanic you trust and have them check it for you ... Someone who will give you the straight poop on it and not try to sell you his services. </p>

"Effects and factors of wheelbase in the design of a motor vehicle","28166","","<p>How does varying wheelbase during automobile design affect the properties of the vehicle that is going to be built (both two-wheelers and four-wheelers)? I know that greater wheelbase means less maneuverability (or maybe it's the other way around). Based on what factors will the wheelbase be finalized and manufactured? What figures of wheelbase are considered ideal, and why?</p>
","<p>There are two concepts to understand (which I think you might already get to an extent). As the wheel base length grows, stability is gained, but you lose maneuverability. You also risk the greater chance of the vehicle becoming high-centered (ground rubbing the center of the vehicle) when traversing bumps in the road unless you increase the ride height of the vehicle or in some way gain more ground clearance, but then you lose some stability due to a higher center of gravity. Conversely, as the wheel base length shrinks, stability is lost, but you gain in maneuverability. Some of the stability can be regained through widening the wheel track (distance between the tires on a given axle). </p>

<p>There are many different reasons why a manufacturer would adjust the wheel base on a vehicle.</p>

<ul>
<li>Use: If a vehicle is to be used off-road (4-wheel drive) purposes, the wheelbase will not be made as long as the longer it is, the easier it will be to get high-centered. If a vehicle is meant for high speed cornering, the vehicle will be lower to the ground and the wheelbase will be longer, with wheels set more forward and back relative to the end of the vehicle.</li>
<li>Aesthetics: How does the designer want a vehicle to look when it's put together? </li>
<li>Manufacturing Costs: When you lengthen a vehicle, costs (such as frame/suspension strengthening and stiffening) come into play, which can drastically change cost.</li>
<li>Viability: Does the vehicle actually need a longer wheelbase to function properly? This goes hand-in-hand with what was said earlier.</li>
<li>Interior Space: As you lengthen the wheelbase, the interior space can be increased. </li>
<li>Weight Distribution: Wheelbase has a great affect on weight distribution, depending on where the axle centers are located in the vehicle.</li>
<li>Weight: As you lengthen a wheelbase while keeping the same distance in front/back of the wheels, your vehicle weight will increase to ""fill in the gap"" between the wheels, as well as what is needed to strengthen the vehicle to be able to handle the extra forces put on it to support it. If you do not overall lengthen the vehicle when increasing the wheelbase, the weight will not increase, but you will lose in other areas, such as trunk (boot) space in the rear.</li>
</ul>

<p>One other thing with relationship to motorcycles:</p>

<ul>
<li>Torque Stability: If the wheelbase is not sufficient where there is an excess of power/torque, the front tire will always want to raise during a power filled takeoff. To counter act this, longer trailing arms will be added which creates a longer lever with the same amount of weight, thus giving the bike more stability on takeoff. (This is counteracting the want of the bike to do a ""wheelie"" during takeoff).</li>
</ul>

<p>These are the basic reasons for selecting a wheelbase by a manufacturer, but <strong>there is no magic ""formula"" for a wheelbase</strong>. A manufacturer must decide for itself why it would want to use a wheelbase of a certain length. They will take all of the factors into account and use what it determines as best for the vehicle design, use, aesthetics, viability, and cost factors.</p>

"How much power (HP) do the components on the engine belt generally use?","27818","","<p>In general, how much power (HP) to the components on the the engine belt actually use? I'm trying to come up with an estimate of how much horsepower an engine wastes on things like the AC compressor, alternator, water pump, pullies, supercharger, etc.</p>

<p>Edit: I realize it's impossible to say specifically since all vehicles are different and put different components on their engines drive belt. Prius and Highlander Hybrid have electric AC, for example, removing the compressor from the drive altogether.</p>

<p>What about some general concept: So a typical small-to-mid-size car with:</p>

<pre><code>- Tensioner
- AC
- Alternator
- Water pump
- Power Steering pump
</code></pre>

<p>HP required for each? In a medium scenario? In a large scenario?</p>

<p>Answer thanks to @Scott and more research done:</p>

<ul>
<li>Small cars (e.g. Corolla, Civic, Focus): 15 HP - 25 HP. (typically have ~80 amp alternators, smaller water pumps, many with elec steering)</li>
<li>Medium cars (e.g. Camry V6, Fusion V6): 25 HP - 40 HP.</li>
<li>Larger cars (e.g. Traverse, Explorer, Mustang V8): 30 HP - 50 HP.</li>
</ul>
","<p>Firstly, the comments made by others are correct. The power used by each of the components listed will vary on a component by component basis and even on an installation by installation basis. The power used by each component will also vary depending on the speed that it is running at. Also the number and type of components will vary from car to car.<br>
With that out of the way, here are some numbers that could be used for rough approximations.   </p>

<h3>Tensioner</h3>

<p>The power used by the tensioner will be minimal and probably negligible. It will depend on how good the bearings are, but if it was using much energy at all, all that energy would be being converted to heat (or possibly noise). So tensioner can be pretty much ignored I think.</p>

<h3>AC</h3>

<p>According to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioner#Equipment_capacity"">Wikipedia's Airconditioner Article</a>    </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In an automobile, the A/C system will use around 5 horsepower (4 kW)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is marked as ""citation needed' though so take it with a grain of salt, but it would be approximately correct for when the aircon is activated. Remember that aircon is electronically clutched so that it's not always on and therefore not always using that much power. </p>

<h3>Alternator</h3>

<p>According to<a href=""http://www.zena.net/htdocs/alternators/alt_inf2.shtml""> Zena Incorporated</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... a 150 Amp alternator, operating at full output, the expected diesel engine load would be about 7-8 hp</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like all the others this number should only be used as an approximation and note that a 150 Amp Alternator is a pretty large alternator.<br>
Also note that this figure is when 'operating at full output' it's pretty rare that an alternator is ever running at full output.</p>

<h3>Water Pump</h3>

<p>According to <a href=""http://www.daviescraig.com.au/Electric_Water_Pumps__EWP-content.aspx"">Davies, Craig FAQ</a> Question No 19   </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Davies, Craig performed a number of tests which concluded that a normal water pump uses up to 10kW of power to operate at its high speeds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Be aware that Davies, Craig sell replacement water pumps that require less power to run so assume the numbers are only approximate.<br>
It's also worth reading through Question 2 on the same page where they describe how the power pulled by a mechanical pump that runs from the drive belt will increase as the cube of the operating speed. So if power draw at 1000rpm is 0.1kW at 2000RPM it will be 0.8kW and at 4000rpm it will be 6.4kW.   </p>

<h3>Power Steering</h3>

<p>According to an <a href=""http://www.eetimes.com/design/embedded/4006457/Electric-power-steering-one-good-turn-deserves-another"">EE Times article by Dave Wilson</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...replacing your three- to five-horsepower steering pump and its
  associated bulky hydraulics with an electric motor is one enhancement
  that actually improves performance</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Be aware that he's selling the virtues of replacing your power steering pump with an electric one, so assume the numbers are only approximate.</p>

<p>So to summarise</p>

<ol>
<li>Tensioner: ~0 kW </li>
<li>AC: 4kW (5hp)</li>
<li>Alternator: 5-6kW (7-8hp)</li>
<li>Water Pump: 10kW (13hp)</li>
<li>Power Steering: 2-4kW (3-5hp)</li>
</ol>

<p>Bear in mind that all these values are approximate to start with and they are for max draw, an AC will draw close to nothing when it's not active, as will an alternator. Traditional water pumps will draw more power the faster they are spinning (so the higher the engine is revving). I'm not entirely sure about Power Steering pumps but I believe that they would only draw max power when being fully utilised.    </p>

"Car dying at low RPM only after filling up with gas","27607","","<p>My question is closely related to one about a <a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/q/2622/1657"">Jag dying at low RPM</a>, but is slightly different because it only occurs after refueling and because the problem persists after cleaning the throttle body, as suggested by the answers.</p>

<p>The car is a 2006 Chrysler 300C, which occasionally dies at low RPM (e.g. at a stop sign). I can feel the RPM drop suddenly and see it on the tach; if they dip too low the engine dies. If I notice it fast enough I can rev the engine to keep it going. Sometimes the engine RPM will stutter while driving as well, but the engine will typically recover if the RPMs are high enough when it happens.</p>

<p>The problem only occurs shortly after filling up with gas and seems to be more likely the lower the tank was at fill-up, but I don't have much data on that. The problem occurs regardless of octane (87 and 89 are both approved for the Hemi engine) and subsides after several miles of driving, especially if it is not stop-and-go. </p>

<li>throttle body cleaned</li>
<li>induction system serviced</li>

These reports very accurately describe what we noticed. </p>

<p><strike>The purge valve solenoid and vapor canister were contaminated with fuel.</p>

By that time we'd moved, so we took the car to a totally different dealership. They also could not reproduce the problem reliably and there was no code on the computer. They called around to a dozen or so other dealerships and ultimately came to the conclusion that the Hemi engines just do not idle well and some of them have a tendency to just shut off.</p>

<p>I don't have corroboration or evidence on this next bit, which is just my speculation, but I suspect that there is just a stack up of various tolerances and timings in the system and gains set in the automatic idle throttle controller in the car's computer that for some engines under some conditions stack up in a way that causes the engine to shut off unpredictably.</strike></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Like I mentioned in my comment, it's definitely not the fuel filter. If a fuel filter was bad enough to affect idle it would stall instead of accelerate. </p></li>
<li><p>A vacuum leak is definitely a possibility since your car has a MAF sensor. In this case I would expect it to be worse in neutral, as a bigger percentage of the air goes unmetered, but I could be wrong about that. Vacuum leaks are quite painful to track down, but many have found that a mechanics stethoscope with an open hose at the end can be helpful in tracking them down. If there are a lot of vacuum hoses that you can't really reach you could also just replace them, they're not very expensive.</p></li>
<li><p>Injectors get clogged over time, but not always at the same rate. This could cause a misfire in the cylinder with the worst (or possibly best) injector. Try some fuel injector cleaner. This is added to the fuel tank and I would use it more concentrated than suggested on the product, or at the maximum concentration if they specify one. You can also have your injectors removed and professionaly cleaned, in which case they also measure how well each injector is flowing. </p></li>
<li><p>EGR (Exhaust Gas Recycling) is not meant to be happening during idle. Sometime the EGR valve can stick open causing a rough idle. I'm not sure if theres a way to determine if this is happening without disassembly, but it is something to investigate.</p></li>

"Downshifting an automatic","27445","","<p>The question of <a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/1210/does-downshifting-engine-braking-cause-extra-wear-and-tear"">whether or not to downshift a manual transmission</a> has been addressed, but what about automatics? I personally always downshift when coming to a stop, and my latest vehicle (Ford Focus) has a Tiptronic-style gear selection mode that I use regularly.</p>

<p>Note that I am referring here to a non-emergency stop in clear weather and level ground. Of course I downshift on steep declines and I personally prefer to hold a lower gear when in challenging driving situations.</p>

<p>Is it ill-advised to downshift an automatic transmission in normal driving?</p>
","<p>First, let's start by listing some facts that we know about the brakes and the engine:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The brakes in a car are designed to stop the vehicle, both in emergency situations as well as under normal driving conditions.</p></li>
<li><p>The automatic transmission in modern automobiles is optimized to keep the engine running at speeds that balance fuel economy with engine output. If an engine runs at too low an RPM or too high an RPM, this output is reduced, and the engine will consume more fuel as a result.</p></li>
<li><p>The 2 and 1 (or L) on the selector lever in an automatic transmission, and the lower gears on the Tiptronic gear selector lever, are designed to give the driver more control over the vehicle in certain circumstances. For instance, 2 is recommended when starting on snow or ice to avoid spinning the wheels, and 2 or 1 are recommended when driving down steep grades to prevent premature brake failure.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Here are the reasons why a driver would <em>need</em> more control over the transmission:</strong></p>

<h2>1 - Safety: Prevent brake failure</h2>

<p>When traveling down steep hills, the continuous pressure applied to the brakes in order to maintain speed causes the brake pads to heat up. Using engine braking on steep hills is a <a href=""http://travel.thefuntimesguide.com/2005/07/downhilldriving.php"">good idea for the following reasons</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a) save your brakes a lot of unnecessary wear &amp; tear<br>
  b) actually HAVE brakes at the end of the hill!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's important to note that the main reason we use engine braking on downhill slopes is to prevent the loss of arguably one of the most critical safety systems in the vehicle, the ability to stop! In other words, in this situation, we trade some wear and tear and loss of fuel economy in exchange for protecting the braking system.</p>

<p>From <a href=""http://www.managemylife.com/mmh/articles/authored/engine-braking-pros-and-cons"">Engine Braking Pros/Cons</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When driving in a mountainous area, braking continuously during a long downhill stretch really heats up your brake components. In this case, it makes sense to alternate between using the brakes and engine braking. If you actually smell your brakes heating up, you should definitely engine brake. If possible, pull off to the side of the road to let the brakes cool off.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>2 - Safety: Prevent loss of control on slippery terrain</h2>

<p>As with braking, running the engine in a lower gear is done as a safety precaution on slippery terrain. Once again, we trade wear and tear on the drivetrain in exchange for decreasing the risk of loss of life, limb, or property, which could occur if the operator loses control of the vehicle and careens into a person, another car, or some other object that creates immediate damage.</p>

<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>

<p>While engine braking, whether it be in a vehicle equipped with an automatic transmission or manual transmission, is primarily used for safety reasons, your specific question is more geared towards whether or not using engine braking as a standard approach to stopping the vehicle is a sound idea.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Saving money?</strong></p>
  
  <p>The main reason people engine brake is to save wear and tear on the brake system. Using the engine to slow the car can mean longer lives for brake pads, discs, rotors, and other expensive brake system parts.</p>
  
  <p>However, increased revving puts added strain on a car's drive train — not only the engine and transmission, but also parts like U joints. Repairs to any of these parts are far more costly than brake repairs. So in the long run, most experts agree that engine braking will probably cost more than using the brakes.
  One argument against engine braking is that it wastes fuel because it causes the engine to rev up. However, this applies mostly to older cars with carburetors. For newer cars with fuel injectors, the increase in fuel consumption is minimal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you approach this purely from a financial standpoint, it doesn't make sense to use engine braking in your daily driving. The amount of wear on the brakes, under normal driving conditions, is negligible, but the tradeoff is more wear and tear on potentially more expensive components. </p>

<p>Additionally, we know more fuel is consumed when the engine isn't running at it's optimum speed for power production.</p>

<p>In summary, engine braking won't do any immediate damage to your vehicle, whether it be automatic or manual. But while it makes sense to use engine braking for safety reasons, it doesn't necessarily make sense to do so for purely financial reasons considering the increased costs and transfer of ear and tear to the engine, transmission, u-joins, and other components involved in powering the vehicle.</p>

"Does tire size and/or tread wear significantly affect speed and speedometer accuracy?","27248","","<p>I've always heard that tread wear affects the speed of your vehicle; i.e. you technically are going faster with new tires than you are with old, worn tires, for a given indicated speed by the speedometer.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you change the wheels on your vehicle for the next size up or down, wouldn't that have a major effect on the speedometer accuracy?</p>

<p>Other sources on the internet indicate that this is true, but there is little information on the degree of effect.</p>
","<p>You can calculate the size of the effect from simple geometry. Tire wear reduces the diameter of the tire, which reduces the circumference of the tire.</p>

<p>New passenger car tires typically come with 10/32"" to 11/32"" of tread depth (<a href=""http://www.tirerack.com/tires/tiretech/techpage.jsp?techid=194"">source</a>). Tires are considered fully worn-out when only 2/32"" of tread remains. So the tire has lost 8/32""--9/32"" on the radius, or 1/2""--9/16"" on the diameter over the life of the tire.</p>

<p>What does this mean in terms of a ""percent error?"" To find out, we need to know the starting circumference of the new tire.</p>

<p>First, a primer on tire size notation. An example tire size would be 205/45-R17.</p>

<ul>
<li>First number: section width in mm. The tire is <strong>205</strong> mm wide</li>
<li>Second number: aspect ratio. The sidewall height of the tire is <strong>0.45</strong> times the section width</li>
<li>Third number: rim size in inches. The tire fits a <strong>17""</strong> wheel.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tire diameter is (roughly) given by the wheel rim size plus two times the sidewall height. In the case of our 205/45-R17 tire, the diameter is roughly 616mm.</p>

<pre><code>(17 * 25.4) + 2 * (205 * 0.45) = 616.3
</code></pre>

<p>(must multiply the rim size by 25.4 to convert inches to millimeters)</p>

<p>The circumference of this new tire is therefore approximately 1936mm</p>

<pre><code>616.3 * 3.14 = 1936
</code></pre>

<p>Now we said we could lose 1/2"" in diameter over the life of the tire, so the worn diameter would be 604mm</p>

<pre><code>616.3 - 1/2 * 25.4 = 603.6
</code></pre>

<p>Which means the worn circumference is 1896mm, or 2% less than the new tire circumference.</p>

<p><strong>So for this example, over the life of your tire, you'd pick up a 2% speedometer error.</strong> Hardly worth worrying about.</p>

<p>Changing tire/wheel sizes can easily have a much larger effect, and care should be taken to try to keep the rolling diameter roughly the same as the recommended tire size.</p>

<p>For what it's worth, my experience is that vehicle manufacturers usually calibrate their speedometers to read fast anyway (they might have legal problems if their speedometers read slow, ""I got this ticket for 60 with my cruise control set on 55""), so you're probably not starting from ""the truth"" anyway. Tire wear would make the speedo read faster still.</p>

<p>A final disclaimer: all the diameter and circumference calculations are ROUGH, as the tire deforms, stretches and slips as it rolls down the road, but I think this is nonetheless a good estimate for the effect of tire wear.</p>

","<p>Realistically, if the manual and the manufacturer are stating you should use 87 octane, <em>that's really what you should use</em>. If you purchase more expensive 89, 91, or 93, you are just wasting money. The higher the octane rating, the harder it is for fuel to burn (or ignite). If the vehicle was specified to use 93, then that's what you should buy or you risk engine damage. You run no risk to the engine by running what the manufacturer says. You'll also gain no performance advantage from running the higher octane, mainly because the engine (and computer tune) are not designed to use it.</p>

"Why can some cars go through water while others can't?","26931","","<p>Why can some cars (mostly old Russian cars on YouTube) seemingly go through water while others can't? I'm talking about situations when the water level is at half the  height of the car, so the engine is under the water. What are the differences between engines that break under water and those that don't?</p>
","<p>driving through water could potentially do a couple of different things:</p>

<p>First off, if the water level is over the tail pipe, the engine rpm must be kept high in order to keep the exhaust pressure up, so that water does not go up the tail pipe and stall the engine. If this was to happen, it wouldn't likely do damage, but the car would have to be towed out of the water, and a modern car would likely throw a trouble code to the computer, causing the computer to have to be re-set. If you were able to drive through, then you didn't have this problem. </p>

<p>If the water level gets above the air intake while the engine is running, the engine could suck in water, and the engine could hydrolock, which means that water is sucked into the cylinders. Because water does not compress like air, water in the cylinders can cause severe damage that will require and engine rebuild or replacement. If water gets in the engine while the engine is stalled, the water will have to be removed before the engine is started or a hydrolock could occur. Remove the spark plugs and crank the engine, and the water will be pumped out of the spark plug holes. If your vehicle hydrolocked, you would know about it, because it would make at least one very loud bang, and would not continue to run. Since most air cleaners are near the top of the engine compartment, in most cases, the water would have to be more than a foot deep to allow water into the air intake. </p>

<p>Finally, if the water gets higher than the vents on your crank case, transmission, or differential, you could get water in your engine, transmission or differential oil. This would allow the vehicle to continue to drive, but over time, it could damage the vehicle. To check if this is the case, check the oil in each of these locations. if the oil on the dipstick appears milky, then there is water in it, and it should be changed.

"Ticking noise when accelerating","26717","","<p>I have a Vauxhall Corsa ""C"" (2003)(EU) which is a standard 16v 1.2 petrol, the engine is chain driven and sits at 50k. I don't think it was well looked after (service wise) in previous lifes.</p>

<p>Recently it sounds a bit more like a diesel when cold, but not too loud -and a common issue with the Corsa, however at the moment when the engine hits ~80-90 degrees it starts to ""tick"" loudly, to the point I can hear it in the cabin.</p>

<h2>Observations</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>When I accelerate the ticking gets faster, if I depress the clutch and throttle, it gets faster, once the ticking starts it doesn't go away till the engine is cool. It will be audible when Idle and parked too.</p></li>
<li><p>""slight"" loss of power,  hardly noticable not anything serious though, and no misfiring or overheating. Taking ~10min to get to temperature in 20-35mph traffic.</p></li>
<li><p>prior to the ticking starting, when moving off in 1st, it sounds a bit ""throaty"" like an exhaust rattle but being in the car I can't work out where this is. No noticable smoke or anything from the exhaust as far as I can tell.</p></li>
<li><p>Plenty (almost full) oil and coolant. Oil is fairly dark and theres a bit of gunk around from a bit of moisture (Not HGF, a common mistake when diagnosing things with this engine!) It's from doing short journeys and the build up of condensation. Multiple owner forums confirmed this.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Conditions:</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Engine is warm and has typically being driven for ~15min</p></li>
<li><p>Starting in cold weather ~0-4 degrees c.</p></li>
<li><p>Used for short journeys (~6 miles each way)</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>When I start the engine, it goes to about 2K RPM, sounds rough for about half a second then it's fine. This has been diagnosed as normal though for this car.</p></li>
<li><p>When I move off when the engine is cold, I get slight revving for the first couple of seconds, again this looks fairly normal for this engine looking on owner forums.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Thoughts?</h2>

<p>My first though would be that it could be the oil, as it gets warmer the vicosity changes and it's not as effective? I thought it could be the timing chain, but it doesn't happen from cold. My third thought would be tappets. I'm not brilliant with mechanics so not a clue.</p>

<p>I recently put some Wynns Hydraulic Lifter fluid into the oil with no success. Sounds the same. The car <em>did</em> have some gasket work done and I'd be suprised if they did a full flush of fluids.</p>

<p>Tried to include as much info as I thought was relevant, but if theres anything else let me know</p>

<h2>EDIT: Conclusion?</h2>

<p>It got a bit worse when the engine got to 85-86ish and the ticking was getting louder, it was also happening on <em>some</em> cold starts for 30seconds.</p>

<p>It went in for a full check hoping it was the Ex. Man. gasket, and they found that the <strong>timing chain</strong> had a small amount of slack on it, and on an unrelated note the oil pressure switch needed replacing, the old oil in the system probably didn't help the longevity of the chain. </p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>
Months on and the car still does the same thing.</p>

<p>I have checked the oil, changed it, had the chain done and still after a 15-20 min drive it will tick away to itself. I think its the tappets, and occasionally the sound will go away again before returning later in my journey.</p>
","<p>Corsa's (actually Vauxhalls/Opels in general) sometimes have noisy hydraulic lifters. I drove mine for 60 thousand kilometers with this noise before I upgraded to a Turbo Coupe and gave the car to my mom. No problems so far. The Coupe had the same stupid tick. Again, I drove it for 30 thousand kilometers before trading it in for a Subaru Forester XT. Only problem I had with it was the turbo. Nothing wrong with the lifters or valves. If you click on my profile and check out my questions, you'll actually see one <a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/7539/astra-turbo-sounding-like-a-diesel"">where I posted a video of a loud ticking coming from my engine bay in the Coupe</a>. I assume this is the same sound you hear. (The video makes it out to be a bit harsher than it actually is).</p>

<p>These noises are usually a valve that's stuck for whatever reason. It's something you can have looked at when the car is in for a major service or something, but it's my experience, and there is considerable consensus, that it's not a serious problem that you need to immediately spend your Valentine's Day money on.</p>

"Brakes make grinding noise during stops at low speeds","26701","","<p>I've got a Mazda B2300 pickup that's started making a grinding sound whenever I come to a stop. Braking at a high speed doesn't make any noise, but once I get under 25-30 MPH, the grinding sound gets progressively worse until the truck comes to a stop. What's the most probable cause of this?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>I replaced the front brake pads on Saturday and discovered that one of them had worn completely down to the backing. I had to replace the rotor as well, since there was severe wear on the mating surface.</p>
","<p>Consider the possibility that the brakes make the noise at all speeds but that higher speeds mask it.</p>

<p>The most likely cause is worn pads/shoes. You should check their remaining thickness against the manufacturer's recommended minimum. (Look in a repair manual if you have one, or search the Web.) Check the thickness of the brake rotors, too.</p>

<p>If the car has been left to sit for a few days, corrosion on the brake rotors can cause brake noise until it is scraped off by the pads.</p>

<p>With some brake pads, particularly metallic or semi-metallic ones, it is normal to hear a mild grinding noise when braking.</p>

"1 Piece versus 2 Piece Drive Shaft","26675","","<p>A guy on a Nissan forum asked why he should keep his 2 piece drive shaft in his truck instead of changing over to a 1 piece version.</p>

<p>This was the answer I gave him:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The 2 piece drive shaft (DS) is meant to prevent the drive shaft from pulling out under extreme axle movement.</p>
  
  <p>The front of the DS slips into the transmission.</p>
  
  <p>The rear of the DS bolts to the rear axle.</p>
  
  <p>As the suspension travels, a conventional 1 piece DS slips in and out of the ""slip sleeve"" (my term) at the transmission.</p>
  
  <p>If the ""slip sleeve"" is short, there is not much room for the axle to move ...or it will fall out.</p>
  
  <p>A 2 piece DS fixes the shaft at a central point, preventing the ""slip sleeve"" from coming out as the rear axle moves around.</p>
  
  <p>Also, a 2 piece DS will absorb some of the vibrations when a DS is out of alignment (due to dirt or getting bent).</p>
  
  <p>That's all I see, anyway. There could be other reasons.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OK, now that I've satisfied that person, I want to know the actual reason why automotive manufacturers elect to use a 2-piece drive shaft as opposed to the <em>""less expensive to manufacture""</em> 1-piece drive shaft.</p>

<p>Can anyone tell me this?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jgSPH.jpg"" alt=""1 Piece versus 2 Piece Drive Shaft""></p>
","<p>I think it's more related to the angle of the driveshaft from the transmission to the differential. This way you could have more suspension travel without putting too much constraints on parts.</p>

<p>In fact, to answer your question, it may be related to the geometry of the truck/driveshaft that manufacturer will select one type over another one. If the truck is long, you don't want the drive shaft hanging under the truck which can be hit and break.</p>

"Why would my electrical systems cut out when I brake?","26527","","<p>So I told this little story to the dealership service department, and they were baffled. Never heard of anything like it in ten years, said they'd have to examine it very closely.</p>

<p>Here's what happened two months ago:</p>

<p>I drive a Subaru Legacy 97. I turned the car on and was about to shift out of Park to drive away, so I stepped on the brake and as I did so, my headlights dimmed, my radio volume shrank and all the interior displays hiccuped. I took my hand off the shift, all thoughts of driving forgotten, and started playing with the brake. It did the same thing repeatedly. After a few tries, I <em>stomped</em> on the brake and <em>everything</em> blinked off entirely for a second, and the engine nearly shut down.</p>

<p>The electricity came back in less than half a second -- it wasn't a prolonged outage -- just a brief interruption --  so the engine caught itself and stayed running. But for just a moment, the whole car had shut off.</p>

<p>This only happened once to that extent once, and I have been unable to reproduce it. Sometimes, however, braking does ever so slightly dim my interior displays, so there is a definite consistency to this.</p>

<p>Since the dealership had no idea, I thought I'd try tapping the infinite well of experience that is Mechanics.SE. Any thoughts?</p>
","<p>Sure enough, you've got a damaged wire that is shorting out the entire electrical system. So think about what happens when you press on the brake pedal, it sends power to your brake lights at the back of the car, so if one of those wires were shorting, you would only notice it when you tap the brakes.</p>

<p>The weird thing is, this doesn't happen very often, because that's what fuses are for. Your brake light fuse should blow when your brake lights short out, preventing the problem from spreading to the rest of your car and killing your engine. So some how the problem seems to be bypassing a fuse. You should check your fuses.</p>

"Which provides better engine flushing, traditional flushing oil or adding a flush additive to old oil?","26463","","<h3>Background</h3>

<p>I think that my vehicle would probably benefit from having it's lubrication system being flushed out at it's next oil change. Checking prices of flushing oil at local suppliers I noticed that they are now also selling a variety of flushing additives <sup>(such as <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B002HN00PS"" rel=""noreferrer"">STP Engine Flush</a>)</sup>.</p>

<p>With flushing oil I would normally drain old oil, half fill with flushing oil, run the engine at a fast idle for a 15-20 minutes to circulate it, drain it again, change oil filter and finally fill up with normal oil. With the additive you don't need to drain the oil twice however, you just add it to the old oil in the engine, run it for 15-20 minutes then drain it out with the old oil and change the filter/oil.</p>

<p>Overall the additive option will be more expensive (£4 per flush rather than £2 per flush for my engine) but will take less time (one complete engine drain/fill rather than two). It would also be more environmentally friendly, as there would be less waste oil to dispose of.</p>

<h3>Question</h3>

<p>So, aside from the cost/time/waste concerns, is the additive solution <em>as effective</em> or even <em>more effective</em> than using traditional flushing oil? Which results in a <em>cleaner</em> engine? I.e. less gunk from the old oil in the new oil.</p>
","<p>The main difference between the two is that flushing oil is extremely thin oil that theoretically should be able to get into partially blocked, thin passages without any issues and remove the accumulated gunk there as well. Oh, and out any slightly leaking gasket, too. It's usually also got a suitable cleaning additive if you've bought a good oil.</p>

<p>The additive doesn't really change the viscosity of the existing oil in the engine and is supposedly ""just"" a concentrated detergent package that you'll find in your regular motor oil (and you can hope that there is no chemical reaction between the two - there normally isn't, but there might be a chance for that). If your oil is already holding a lot of contaminant in suspension and the oil filter is reaching its filtering capacity, then you might to more harm than good.</p>

<p>I've used both, and I still (very) occasionally use flushing oil. However, for a decent running engine that hasn't suffered from a lot of contamination, I tend to prefer the third option - change the oil a couple of times in fairly short intervals, use a high-detergent oil (I like using diesel-specific oil that's also got the correct classifications for petrol engine, as that has a lot more detergents in it than the petrol engine variety) and change the filter every time. Oh, and use a high quality filter so it actually traps the contaminants that are cleaned out by the oil.</p>

"How much protection do grill guards give?","25974","","<p>My wife was just rear-ended by some woman who was ""tired"" (her claim&mdash;in fact she was more probably texting) and not paying attention.  This did a lot of damage to the rear end of our Honda Pilot.  This is the third accident my wife has been in in a year where someone else was not paying attention, and I want to take some preventative action.  Grill guards (and rear bumper guards—I'm using the term generically since a search for ""grill guards"" will bring up both) give the appearance of being strong and solid pieces of metal that add extra protection for the body of your car, but I'm wondering if that appearance is deceiving.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UVZrm.jpg"" alt=""A grill guard""></p>

<p>Here are some examples:
<a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00D6940S0"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.amazon.com/2009-2013-Honda-Bumper-Protector-Stainless/dp/B00D6940S0</a>

<p>One reason for my skepticism is from <a href=""http://www.carid.com/2004-honda-pilot-grill-guards/"" rel=""noreferrer"">the blurb here</a>, which says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Honda Pilot 2004, 2.5"" Ultimate Bull Bar by Westin®, with Removable
  Stainless Steel Skid Plate. The secret of living a peaceful life in
  the asphalt jungle is to add a scary edge to your looks. The Ultimate
  Bull Bar is perfect for the purpose....</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact that they focus exclusively on the appearance and do not even address the issue of structural protection leads me to believe perhaps they know it's all a facade, and are carefully avoiding making any claims they know could come back to haunt them, so they sell it as a way of massaging their customers' egos rather than actually protecting anything or anyone.</p>

<p>How much protection do these actually offer?  Can they in some situations eliminate body or structural damage to your car, and in others reduce it?</p>
","<p>There a several moderately complex and variable issues in this question.  It is impossible to adequately adress all the variables, but here are some key points.</p>

<p>First there are almost no after market protectors for the rear of the most vehicles.  There are some companion rear bumpers sold for ""brush guard"" type front bumpers. While heavier than stock bumpers they are primarily geared towards providing solid points of attachment for towing and pulling. These will provide little additional protection in the case of a rear impact, and may actually lead to increases in damage (<em>at high speed</em>) as they tend to be mounted directly to the frame, so any shock absorber benefits of a stock bumper are lost.</p>

<p>Grill guards come in two basic styles, ""just for looks"" and ""intended for impact"". As you may expect many of the chrome plated grill guards you see in your daily drive are just for looks. While shining does not always mean just for looks, the majority of ""intended for impact"" bumpers (<em>in my experience</em>) are painted flat black.  This is because, you expect them to come into contact with; brush, rocks, trees, earth.  Touch up with a can of flat black spray paint is really easy. </p>

<p>The primary identifier of an ""intended for impact"" front bumper/quard is it's attachment.  Let us consider the grill guard pictured in the question. The stock bumper is still in place, so it is unlikely that the ""guard"" is bolted to the frame, in most of these types of applications it the guard is connected using light screws to equally light body parts. In the event of a frontal impact, the attachments will pull out, tearing the parts of the body, it will then fold up into the grill of the vehicle. All of this happens before the shock absorbers in the stock bumper have the opportunity to do anything. So a collision that may have left no notable blemish on your truck, has torn out part of the lower radiator support, and smashed your grill.</p>

<p>Bumpers/guards designed for impact <a href=""http://www.quadratec.com/categories/jeep_bumpers_towing_racks/"" rel=""noreferrer"">(<em>some examples</em>)</a> fully replace the stock bumper. There are bolted directly to the frame and are intended to transfer any force applied directly to the frame of the vehicle, protecting the soft parts like, fender, grills and radiators. There are a many options for brush type additions on the basic frame mounted bumper.  Personal preference and expected terrain are the primary motivators in the decision.  If you are going to be driving up on rocks you might want something like this.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GkBFh.jpg"" alt=""My TJ on Rocks""></p>

<p>Another body protection option is for the side, often called ""Nerf Bars"" or ""Rock Guards"" these are bumpers for the side of your vehicle. These are particularly helpful when you have the possibility of having rocks or trees, impacting the side of your vehicle.  As with grill guards these also come in ""just for looks"" and ""intended for impact"".  If they screwed to tin rather then bolting to a steel frame, you are likely to do more damage by installing something ""just for looks"".  Particularly if it has more impact than someone standing on it to get in the vehicle. A well constructed nerf bar, can actually be used as a fulcrum while in off road situations.  </p>

<p>So to answer your question. If you buy and properly install quality protection it can offer a lot of protection. Particularly in low speed high force events.  My TJ was 10 years old and not a dent in the body when I sold it. </p>

<p>But if you are in a highway speed accident, little additional protection is offered.  These devices work by transferring forces away from light duty body parts to the stronger steel frame. </p>

Knowing that it’s turning over, I usually plant my foot, and it all of a sudden will roar back to life after no specific period of time. This morning it was a good couple of seconds (I was doing about 80 km/h, and it kicked back in when I had slowed to about 60 km/h). Other times it dies and then comes back in almost straight away.</p>

<p>It also can die while stationary at traffic lights etc, it will usually start back up but again today it just turned over and over and over and didn't start for about 30 seconds.</p>

<p>I’m thinking it could be:</p>

<ol>
<li>Fuel pump</li>
<li>Coil / Dizzy</li>
<li>Some kind of air / exhaust sensor</li>
</ol>

<p>The problem is because it’s so intermittent and hard to replicate, I don't know how to diagnose it better myself and don’t know where to start.</p>
","<p>The problem was finally fixed.</p>

<p>After reading the manual I suspected a piece called the TFI Module which is attached to the distributor ($30 piece). All of my symptoms were pointing to this part except the manual (and forums) said usually you need to let the car cool down for up to 5 minutes before it will restart.</p>

<p>New distributors come with TFI modules already attached and a complete Bosch distributor for my car was only about 150 bucks so I thought may as well take that out of the equation as well.</p>

<p>Long story short, replaced distributor (with TFI module) and boom - no more issues :)</p>

"Remove rust from brake rotors","25478","","<p>I have noticed some rust formation on the rear rotor. I am able to scrape the rust off with a hard toothbrush. I noticed other rotors, but they appear to be fine.</p>

<p>What is the best way to get rid of rust on the brake rotors?</p>

<p>Edit: I do not have the tools/skills required to remove the rotor and the wheel.</p>
","<p>Where is the rust at? If it is on the outer edges and/or on the hat area (part in the center where the brake pad does not ride), there's probably absolutely nothing wrong with the brake rotor in the first place. As long as the wear area where the pad does it's business is clear, you have no issues. Only brake rotors which have been treated with some type of anti-rust agent (like zinc plating) will not rust in these areas.</p>

<p>If on the other hand it is where the pad should be riding at, you may (as @Paul was suggesting) have an issue with your caliper being stuck or possibly not sliding correctly on its pins. Since you said you don't have any means of removing the brake rotor yourself, you'd need to take it to a brake/mechanic's shop to have it fixed.</p>

"Car always takes several attempts to start, what's the problem?","25342","","<p>Recently (since the beginning of the winter), my car has been taking several attempts to start every time I use it.</p>

<p>Several factors about the car have changed, so it's hard for me to tell what's really the problem.</p>

<p>The car's specs are: 1996 Toyota Avalon XLS, 110k mi, V6.</p>

<p>Here is a link to a <strong>video</strong> of me trying to start the car: <a href=""https://vid.me/CXnZ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://vid.me/CXnZ</a></p>

<p>The clacking sound in the beginning is the tape deck, I shut that off after my second attempt to start the car. After that, each click is me turning the key. </p>

<p>You can see the ""BRAKE"" light turn off/on each time I turn the key. It's hard to hear the sounds from outside the car, but after each key turn there is a quiet electrical sounding ""click"" sound. </p>

<p>Eventually, when every light in the dash turns off except for the seat-belt and a yellow sensor light, that's when the car finally turned on. </p>

<ul>
<li>I only use the car about once a week, and only for about 30 minutes at a time. I used to use it every day and this wasn't an issue.</li>
<li>The battery is newly (within the last 2 months) replaced with a Kirkland brand battery which matches the car (775 CCA). </li>
<li>This problem was an issue <em>before</em> I replaced the battery, but it's been progressively getting worse (takes more attempts to start each time).</li>
<li>I cleaned the cable terminals which attach to the battery with a mixture of baking soda and water when I replaced it.</li>
<li>The oil hasn't been changed in a bit of time (since 100k mi), but it is at a good level (I've topped it off while the engine was warm).</li>
<li>Coolant levels are good as well.</li>
<li>The car is stored in a heated underground garage (the temperature only gets about as low as 50 F/10 C in there).</li>
<li>Once I'm out and about, after a bit of the driving, the car starts with no problems after I shut it off.</li>
<li>When I turn the key, all dash lights work and I can hear the fuel pump starting.</li>
</ul>

<p>I start my car by immediately turning the key to start, should I be letting the fuel pump work first, or waiting a bit on standby (just having the key half-turned)?</p>

<p>I think the issue here is that the battery just isn't getting enough use for it to remain charged. Once I am driving, there aren't any issues starting and the battery seems to charge. </p>

<p>Given that I only use the car once a week,  it seems that each time I get back to it any charge that it had after it's last use has dissipated.</p>

<p>Are there any ways to mitigate this? Should I get a different battery which may hold charge longer? </p>
","<p>There are two things I'd look at as the problem. </p>

<p>First and most likely is the solenoid on the starter is almost shot. The solenoid has a large copper washer which is pressed into the two posts (one from the battery connection and the other going to the starter motor). When this wears out, you'll get a clicking sound (almost a dead thud) as the Bendix is pushed into the flywheel, yet no power is supplied through to the starter motor itself. Once in a while after several tries, it can hit a ""good"" spot in that washer and allow it to have continuity so the starter has power. You can have this checked by taking your starter to a local parts store and have them bench test it for you.</p>

<p>Secondly, and I'm not sure on your vehicle how it works, is if the relay to the starter has gone bad. Some vehicles have it located in the steering column and is actuated by turning the key (via a rod). You car could also be utilizing an electric relay, which is energized when the key is turned in the ignition to the start position. Either one of these situations would be a little bit more problematic to figure out. If it's done by a relay, you'd have to find the relay and change it out with a known good one (usually located under the hood of the car in the under hood fuse box portion). If the relay is a direct power version actuated by rod and a key turn, you'd need to find the wiring which is associated with this, pull the plug, then jump the correct two wires together to see if it would cause the starter to turn. </p>

<p>By no means would I consider the battery to be the issue.</p>

"VW Mk4 Golf/GTI airbag indicator warning light","25261","","<p>My 2002 VW GTI MkIV recently had the airbag warning indicator light turn on. The VW dealership wanted to charge around $600 to fix it. They told me the seatbelt latch was at fault because it had an intermittent connection issue, so I bought a new one and replaced it myself. The dealer then reset the fault code and the light turned off. However, as soon as a slid my seat to adjust it, the light came right back on. What's the problem?</p>
","<p>I took my car to a different VW shop (not the dealership) and they fixed the problem for $160, but if I'd known the solution was just to solder the wires directly together, I could have fixed it myself. I did however, learn what the problem was thanks to them and I'll share the solution here. VW apparently knows about this issue and supposedly offers special repair kits for it. I think it applies to all the VW mk4 Jetta/Golf/GTI because they use the same connectors. The fault-code can be thrown simply by moving/sliding the front seats because the electrical connection in the wires below the front seats are poor. The intermittent connection fault-code is (usually) due to high electrical resistance in the connectors themselves. The pins have loose contact or have dirt/corrosion from oxidization, or both.</p>

<p>One solution is to solder each of the wires directly to their partners, bypassing the 2 yellow plastic connectors altogether (see image below). Of course, you won't be able to swap out your seat for a new one as easily, but if you're planning to keep the same seats forever this fix is very cheap, requires no electrical resistors, and still maintains the original manufacturer functionality (if your belt isn't fastened, the airbag won't deploy). This method solved the problem in my car.</p>

<p>Now I'm having the same fault-code appear with the passenger-side seat (I knew it was only a matter of time) and I'll be fixing it myself. The procedure:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Disconnect the car battery.</strong></li>
<li>Snip off the 2 yellow plastic connectors related to the seat belt, but remember which wires are paired together! (See image below)</li>
<li>Solder the 4 wires to their matching colors, be sure to properly insulate each of the wires.</li>
<li>Wrap the whole bundle of 4 wires together to help prevent future fatigue.</li>
<li>Reconnect the battery.</li>
<li>Reset the fault code (a VAG-COM KKL 409.1 USB Interface diagnostic cable can do this).</li>
</ol>

<p>If this was indeed the cause of your intermittent resistance and everything was done correctly then the warning light should stay OFF.</p>

"How is engine load determined?","25256","","<p>I'm struggling to find information on how engine load is defined. Is it really just a fancy word for torque demand?</p>

<p>There are three parts to this question:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is there a theoretical equation that is used to define engine load? If so, what is it? I couldn't find anything definitive in the <a href=""http://amzn.com/0837617324"">Bosch Automotive Handbook</a>.</p></li>

</ol>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Is there a theoretical equation that is used to define engine load?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's not theoretical, but real. According to <a href=""http://standards.sae.org/j1979_201408/"">SAE International SAE J1979 / ISO 15031-5</a> (dated: 2014-08-11), calculated engine load is calculated by the <a href=""http://www.autotechconsultants.info/files/Calculated_Load_and_Absolute_Load_Calculations.pdf"">following equation</a>:</p>

<pre><code>LOAD_PCT = [current airflow] / [(peak airflow at WOT@STP as a function of rpm) * 
     (BARO/29.92) * SQRT(298/(AAT+273))]
Where:

- STP = Standard Temperature and Pressure = 25 °C, 29.92 in Hg BARO, 
- SQRT = square root
- WOT = wide open throttle 
- AAT = Ambient Air Temperature (in °C)

Characteristics of LOAD_PCT are:

- Reaches 1.0 at WOT at any altitude, temperature or rpm for both naturally
  aspirated and boosted engines.
- Indicates percent of peak available torque.
- Linearly correlated with engine vacuum
- Often used to schedule power enrichment.
- Compression ignition engines (diesels) shall support this PID using fuel
  flow in place of airflow for the above calculations. 
</code></pre>

<p>The second part of this portion (Characteristics) gives you a lot of the information you are seeking. The percentage given by the equation indicates percent of peak available torque. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What parameters does an ECU look at to sense and determine the engine load? I don't think there is a single tell-all sensor which returns the engine load; there are likely several signals being combined here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There isn't a single sensor it uses to figure this out. For a gasoline (or spark ignition) engine, it utilizes the Air Intake Sensor (IAT), Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) sensor, Throttle Position Sensor (TPS), and Engine Coolant Temperature (ECT) sensor to do calculations and to discover if the engine is at the ready point to make the calculations. The percentage variable can be read from the ECU using PID $04. According the the standard, both compression ignition (diesel) and spark ignition (gasoline) systems are required to maintain this.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some ECU's appear to make a distinction between relative and absolute engine load. What is the difference between the two?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You've seen the above equation for calculated engine load. Below is the calculation for <em>absolute engine load</em>:</p>

<pre><code>LOAD_ABS = [air mass (g / intake stroke)] / [1.184 (g / intake stroke) *
     cylinder displacement in liters]

Derivation:

- air mass (g / intake stroke) = [total engine air mass (g/sec)] / 
    [rpm (revs/min)* (1 min / 60 sec) * (1/2 # of cylinders (strokes / rev)]

- LOAD_ABS = [air mass (g)/intake stroke] / [maximum air mass (g)/intake 
    stroke at WOT@STP at 100% volumetric efficiency] * 100%. 

Where:

- STP = Standard Temperature and Pressure = 25 °C, 29.92 in Hg (101.3 kPa)
  BARO
- WOT = wide open throttle

The quantity (maximum air mass (g)/intake stroke at WOT@STP at 100% 
volumetric efficiency) is a constant for a given cylinder swept volume. 
The constant is 1.184 (g/liter 3) * cylinder displacement (liter 3/intake
stroke) based on air density at STP.

Characteristics of LOAD_ABS are:

- Ranges from 0 to approximately 0.95 for naturally aspirated engines,
  0 – 4 for boosted engines
- Linearly correlated with engine indicated and brake torque,
- Often used to schedule spark and EGR rates,
- Peak value of LOAD_ABS correlates with volumetric efficiency at WOT.
- Indicates the pumping efficiency of the engine for diagnostic purposes.
</code></pre>

<p>As you can probably see, this equation relies on the flow of air and basically engine displacement. As it states in the body, this correlates with volumetric efficiency (how completely a cylinder fills with air on the intake stroke) at WOT. This variable can be read from the ECU on PID $43. It is only required by the standard on spark ignition systems. </p>

"Effect of loss of fuel tank vapours on mileage","25094","","<p>Are there any estimates available on how much fuel you can expect to lose from a fuel tank that is leaking vapours? Leaking vapours would be caused by cracked/missing evaporative emissions hoses, a leaky/missing fuel cap, et cetera. </p>

<p>I realise that the exact amount would depend on a number of variables, like temperature and the amount of sloshing in the tank. That's okay, I'm after an 'order of magnitude' estimate or an upper limit.</p>

<p>Any numbers would be quite helpful, whether they be from reliable documentation, anecdotes, forum posts etc. </p>

<p>The reason for the question is that I have been investigating some very poor mileage on a car with a 60% increase over specification on the highway, but very good power otherwise. I'm waiting for a new EVAP check valve, as the old one was very leaky. I'm wondering how much of an increase in consumption this could have made in a worst case scenario.</p>
","<p>In this particular case replacing the EVAP check-valve didn't make a measurable difference to fuel economy. It seems that the amount of fuel vapour involved is very small and only really of interest from an emissions point of view. Unfortunately, I never to got the crude estimate that I was originally after.</p>

<p>The <em>real</em> reason for the horrible fuel consumption was the engine getting 'stuck' in open-loop mode. The ECU would enter open-loop mode (going rich to protect the engine) at a fairly high throttle setting but would not exit open loop mode until it reached a much lower throttle setting. It turned out that most of my highway driving would occur latched in open-loop mode between these two points. I would end up in open-loop mode when climbing a hill, or passing, and then stay there until I had to slow down. The vehicle had larger off-road tyres which increased the gear ratio somewhat and also increased drag, as well as a rather small engine.</p>

<p>After installing a rich/lean indicator for the O2 sensor, I was able to achieve the advertised fuel consumption despite having the off-road tyres, just by making staying out of open loop mode.</p>

<p>The vehicle was an Australian Daihatsu Feroza. Those came with a MAP-based EFI system. </p>

"What happens to a car engine when giving max throttle while not in gear","25074","","<p>I was driving (well standing still actually) during rush hour, and I was suddenly wondering what would happen to a car engine when I would push the accelerator pedal all the way down while the engine is not in gear. Since most equipment these days is made pretty idiot proof I expect it wouldn't just blow up from the extreme RPM, but what would happen? Are there any detrimental effects? Can an engine survive these extreme RPMs, or is there a fail safe and would it just shut off?</p>

<p>(I understand this isn't really a car repair question, but from all the SO sites I think this one would be the correct one to get some insights in this question)</p>
","<p>The RPM's would certainly increase but the mechanical components would be prevented from exceeding maximum RPM's by a rev-limiter.</p>

<p>Rev-limiters are built into the ECU (computer) of the car.  When an engine is spinning at it's maximum RPM set by the manufacturer the ECU will not send a spark to particular cylinders to prevent the engine from spinning faster and potentially damaging itself.  </p>

<p>If a rev-limiter were not in place the engine would have a high likely-hood of experiencing valve to piston contact.  Valve to piston contact occurs when the valve cannot close quickly enough to get out of the way of the piston on an upstroke.  The result is catastrophic with a hole being punched in the top of the piston by the lingering valve.  Results of this type of failure will vary.  Imagine loose bits of aluminum and steel flying around inside of an engine at or beyond it's maximum RPM's and you get the idea.</p>

<p>This applies to modern cars with rev-limiters.  Older vehicles will not have this self-protection device.  I defer to an expert with more information regarding when rev-limiters began to be implemented by the manufacturers to edit this answer with some of that information and remove this paragraph.  Thanks.</p>

"Headlights turning off randomly","25048","","<p>I have a 95 Chevy S10.</p>

<p>When I drive my truck around at night I notice that occasionally my headlights turn off for about 3 seconds and then come back on by themselves. There doesn't seem to be any kind of consistency to it. It does it when I'm driving, when I'm sitting, even when the engine is turned off. It made a clicking sound a couple of times too if I remember rightly.</p>

<p>Tonight I drove again and it got so bad that they wouldn't stay on for more than a few seconds and since I've been wiggling the wires behind the headlight switch they haven't yet come back. I don't know for sure if wiggling had any effect or not though or if it was coincidental (Wiggling didn't cause any flickering). When I wiggled the wire connector thingy that leads into the headlights switch I noticed that it was hot which didn't seem right to me.</p>

<p>When I drove home I tried to turn them off then on again until it worked, but I don't know if it came back (when it did come back) because of that. (I mention that as a possible explanation for the hot connector.)</p>

<p>The daytime running lamps stay on (or at least I think they are the DRL's, (they're yellow)).</p>

<p>Some other details that could be related although may be entirely unrelated are that both the fog lights and the dashboard lights that light up the meters haven't ever worked since I bought the thing a couple months ago (e-brake, check engine etc lights still work though). The reason I mention it is because both of these are also switches next to the headlight switch and connect in the same general area.</p>

<p>Being that I know very little about vehicles I wiggled some random wires near the headlights themselves and near the battery and it had no effect. I'm assuming it's something in the wiring in the cab.</p>

<p>Any advice?</p>
","<p>The headlight wiring is protected from being overheated (a short,overcurrent) by a circuit breaker. It operates like a circuit breaker in your house except it has an auto reset feature.

I can imagine how that could be even worst than a broken engine for safety reasons.</p>

<p><strong>*What exactly are all of the disadvantages to running an engine when the brake fluid becomes too low?</strong></p>
","<p>Not having brake fluid in your car won't destroy the brakes, but whatever you hit when the brakes don't work just might. :)
<br><br>
The brakes in basically every passenger car since the 50's are hydraulically operated. That means when you press the brake pedal you are pressurizing some fluid lines. Those lines run out to the wheels where the added pressure forces the pads against the rotors or drums. 
<br><br>
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UYcne.gif"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UYcne.gif"" alt=""Simplified brake system""></a>
<br><br>
If that fluid is low or missing you will end up with nothing but air in those lines. Air is very compressible, which means when you squeeze it it's volume decreases. The brake fluid in your car is for all intents and purposes incompressible. That means when your foot on the brake pedal operates the master cylinder which squeezes the fluid into the lines that force is transmitted almost completely to operating the brakes. When there is air in the line all you do is move the air around a little and you apply very little force into operating the brakes. When you have only a little air in the lines the pedal just feels ""spongy"" because you compress the bubbles down to nothing and then you are closing the brakes. When there is a lot of air, or no fluid at all, you just don't operate the brakes at all, and you have a very bad day.. <br><br>
The good news is that topping off the fluid with the right type (DOT-3, DOT-4, and a collection of others are used depending on what car you own) and then bleeding the brakes will bring them right back again. That assumes that when they were dry you didn't end up with any kind of debris in the lines. With no brakes you likely didn't drive it much though.. lol Bleeding the brakes just means opening those hydraulic lines at one wheel at a time and pumping the brakes. That forces the fluid and air through the line and out the tube that's open. Eventually you end up with nothing but fluid and can close that line off and do the same for the others. There's a bit more to it, but that's the simplified version. <br><br>
Bottom line, unlike your engine where the fluid is a lubricant, in your brakes the fluid is a hydraulic fluid. So it's not a catastrophic destruction when it's low, just needs to be properly maintained and you're back on the road.</p>

<p>Hope that helps!</p>

<p>Will the ECM need to be reconfigured? </p>

<p>I've heard it might have issues passing DEQ?</p>
","<p>The biggest risk in my mind is getting one that does not work.  I'd be nervous about grabbing one from a boneyard, even if they'll replace a dud, going through the work of installing it to find out you've got a bad one would suck.  Getting one from a vendor selling refurbished units with a warranty would be an entirely different deal.  </p>

<p>As far as to whether it needs to be reconfigured, possibly not, as long as it comes out of a donor Corolla of the same year with the same powertrain.  Depending on where you get it from, you may or may not know what it has in the way of loaded firmware, but that might not be a problem.  It's possible there was fix issued that requires a hardware change, but I think that's pretty rare.</p>

<p>I suppose there could be issues with emissions if they're checking a VIN stored in the module against the one on your registration.  Or if you're in California and you don't get a module with some California specific firmware load.   </p>

<p>Having a dealer swap in a new one will eliminate any uncertainties regarding firmware and emissions.  You should get the latest firmware and they'll use your VIN if it's actually stored.  That will be the most expensive route, though.  It's possible there are aftermarket sources that have the capability to bench flash a module before shipping it to you that would take care of all that, but I don't know of any of the top of my head.  It looks like Toyota has made the <a href=""http://classic.artsautomotive.com/ToyotaFlash.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">tools</a> available to flash the ECM, so, actually, a properly equipped shop can do this, too.  Sounds like there might be some kind of extended warranty on the ECM from the quick bit of forum surfing that I did.  Check into that before you go out of pocket on a replacement.  </p>

<p>You probably ought to try and figure out what killed you existing module. If it was killed by some kind of electrical problem, the replacement could suffer the same fate. </p>

<p>Oh, and in a 2003, I'd think it would be more of a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powertrain_control_module"" rel=""nofollow"">PCM</a> than an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine_Control_Module"" rel=""nofollow"">ECM</a>.  The difference can be a little fuzzy, but in my mind, if it's controlling the transmission shift points, or would be if the vehicle had an automatic transmission, it's a PCM.  Hmm, looks like Toyota calls it an ECM though.  </p>

"Patch A/C condenser?","24529","","<p>I have a small leak at the top of my air conditioning condenser.</p>

<p>Last summer, I tried patching it with JB Weld. They do advertise as working with all metals, but I suspect it failed to hold because it doesn't bond well to aluminum. I could get enough refrigerant in to get some cold air, and then the patch would blow. By the third patch, it seems the hole was getting bigger because it blew very easily. (So, I guess it must have had enough hold to pull some more metal out — d'oh.)</p>

<p>How would I go about patching with a torch? My closest experience is with brazing on brass. Just getting a little aluminum plug welded over the tiny hole shouldn't be too bad.</p>

<p>What kind of torch, flux, and rod would I use? Is there anything in particular to know about condenser tubing?</p>
","<p>I think most pros will tell you not to bother trying to patch a condenser leak, just replace it. While that's not always an option, it's definitely an option you should consider first.<br>
Can you source cheap second-hand unit for your car? Unfortunately condensers and radiators are often damaged in car accidents so second-hand units can be a bit dicey, so make sure you check it thoroughly and try to get a warranty with it. Obviously you could also try sourcing a new OE or aftermarket unit as well.<br>
Your next best bet would be to remove the condenser yourself and take it to a radiator repair place and see if they're repair it for you. Removing it (and then fitting it again) yourself will save paying someone for the trouble. A radiator place probably won't charge much for a repair, assuming they think a repair is possible, as it shouldn't really take them very long. It usually takes a lot longer to get the unit out of and into the car than it does to do the actual repair.<br>
Failing all that, you could try to do the repair yourself (which was your actual question I know). I'm afraid I know very little about this sort of welding so I'm not qualified to answer, but if you search for radiator repair/welding you should find plenty of info and radiator repair is pretty much the same as condenser repair. And hopefully someone with welding skills will chime in here with some more info for you.</p>

"Replacing oil sump plug washer after every oil change","24501","","<p>As the title says, does the oil sump plug washer need to be replaced after every oil change, or can they be reused?</p>

<p>Background - my 2005 Daihatsu Copen needs an oil change every 3000 miles. I have always reused the washer in previous cars three times before replacing them, however these cars have far longer service intervals at 15,000 miles.</p>
","<p>Replacing the washer depends on what the washer material is made out of. Most OEM parts are rubber based, so are both cheap and designed to be one use only.</p>

<p>There are also crush washers, which need to be replaced after every use.</p>

<p>There are a number of aftermarket (usually magnetic) sump plugs and washers - a large number of these have hard, flat, washers and can be reused a few times (&lt; 10 times).</p>

"What are the benefits of a lightweight flywheel and why aren't they lightweight already?","24491","","<p>This <a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/24566/what-does-a-flywheel-do-and-what-is-it-connected-to"">previous question</a> explains what a flywheel does and why it is needed.  That explanation means that the flywheel needs a certain amount of mass to do its job.  However, an ""upgrade"" for many cars (when looking at performance enhancements) is a ""lightweight"" flywheel.</p>

<p>Removing weight from a performance car is a normal thing to do, so a lightweight flywheel seems like a good choice, but doesn't it need that mass?  What are the advantages other than sheer weight loss to the upgraded flywheel?  If it was <em>only</em> a good thing than the OEM flywheel would be lightweight already, so what are the cons?</p>

<p>Is there such a thing as a heavyweight flywheel?</p>

","<p>The main advantage to a lower flywheel mass on race cars is that the reduced mass allows the engine to rev more freely. The overall weight loss to the car is really not the key thing, it's letting the engine vary RPM really quickly. </p>

<p>Being able to change RPM quickly can mean faster shifts, getting to a power band more quickly, etc, etc. It also makes the car much more twitchy to drive since it doesn't like low RPM very much. At low RPM the lower mass of the flywheel means you need to use the throttle to keep the RPM above where the flywheel isn't going to carry things around as well. For a race car that's not a big deal. For the family driver with the manual transmission, it's a big problem. </p>

"Is there a reason keyless ignition cars do not shut off when it can no longer detect the keyfob?","24368","","<p>There's been some security-related questions being asked here and on sister sites concerning keyless ignition automobiles and how to defend against some security risks. This brings up a related question.</p>

<p>Why do cars keep running if the car can no longer detect the keyfob?</p>
","<p>As JPhi1618 mentioned, this functionality centers around <a href=""http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7d443eb75ceba033fed91e90f816b574&amp;node=se49.6.571_1114&amp;rgn=div8"" rel=""nofollow"">CFR 571.114</a>, AKA FMVSS 114. Specifically section 5.2.1 which states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Except as specified in S5.2.3, the starting system required by S5.1 must prevent key removal when tested according to the procedures in S6, unless the transmission or gear selection control is locked in “park” or becomes locked in “park” as a direct result of key removal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An important point to understand is that car manufacturers consider the electronic code transmitted from the key-fob to the starting system the digital equivalent of a physical key, so the ""removal"" of the ""key"" occurs when the driver presses the button to shut off the car and the code is cleared from the starting system.</p>

<p>This would make it trivially easy to violate the regulation if the car cleared the start code as soon as the key fob was too far away, as it would allow a situation where the ""key"" can be ""removed"" before the car is put into park. So to skirt around that regulation, the car simply remains running so the car makers can argue that the ""key"" cannot be ""removed"" before the car is put into park. As an aside here, you could argue that it still violates the regulation, as many cars with push button start/stop will stop without the transmission being set to the ""park"" position when the start/stop button is pressed.</p>

<p>It looks like the last time CFR 571.114 was updated was in 2010, and it hasn't really kept up with this technology. There's a lot of grey area, lawsuits, and it'll probably be a few years before the law and technology fully mature here.</p>

<p><strong>Edited to address @user1663987's comment:</strong> If the car engine stopped when the key-fob is moved too far away, then the car mfg would have to implement a system that physically prevents the driver from removing the key-fob from the car unless the system is in park to stay in compliance with the regulation. This would pretty much defeat the ""key-less"" point, as the best way to ""lock"" the key-fob in the car while it's running would be to just have a key on it and use a traditional key-based ignition. So in a sense, this behavior is a ""desired"" interpretation of the regs because it the car mfg doesn't have to kill a desirable selling point for their vehicle.</p>

<p>There is a safety aspect that can be considered, in the event that the key-fob is unexpectedly removed from the vehicle while driving (e.g.: child tosses it out the window), however this isn't something that's currently addressed in the regulations. It's possible that auto makers have looked into this already and found that a vehicle with a key-less ignition that continues running regardless of the proximity of the key-fob is safe, though reports of people leaving their vehicles running by mistake would indicate otherwise. At this point I've wandered into the realm of speculation, so I'll stop here.</p>

"Engine never warms up (actually: it cools down) at highway speeds","24167","","<p>I have a 1997 Caravan (base model) and normally on my drive to work and my highway drives in rush-hour, the engine warms up just fine.</p>

<p>I took a road trip for work, about an hour and fifteen minutes of driving at basically 60-80mph the whole way. The engine never warmed up. In fact it went from being warmed up (about halfway up the gauge) to just barely above the Cold marker.</p>

<p>My blower only works on high, (a problem for another day) so turning on the heat for that chilly drive made the problem even worse (lost like a bar and a half of engine temp for running the heater at 75% temp, full blower, for maybe 10-15 minutes.) I turned off the heat for the last 30-45 minutes of the drive and it still never returned to normal temperature.</p>

<p>It's the Mitsubishi 3.0L V6, which I believe is a cast-iron block, if that helps.</p>

<p>It's also a 3-spd, so the engine works pretty hard to maintain highway speeds above 60, it should be producing plenty of heat. What's the best way to go about solving this problem?</p>

<p>(For comparison sake, in stop and go traffic, on my way into work, it takes about 20 minutes for that engine to warm up, not using the heater.)</p>
","<p>It sounds like the engine thermostat has failed in an open state.  The thermostat regulates the flow of coolant between the radiator and the engine.  When the engine needs more heat, it closes and cuts-off flow through the radiator.  When the engine needs less heat, it opens and allows flow to the radiator.  With the thermostat stuck open, the flow through the radiator is constant and so your engine will have a hard time keeping it's heat.</p>

<p>This sort of problem can happen anytime, but it's not until the weather starts cooling that it gets noticed.  Colder outside air means more cooling from the radiator.</p>

<p>As your your other question, ""could any serious damage have been done with the engine below operating temp at highway speeds..."" The answer is probably not.  You may have lost some fuel economy, but cooling an engine too much shouldn't be too much of a problem.  The other extreme, having too much heat, is where engines start to have big problems.</p>

<p>In either case, a replacement thermostat is typically very cheap, usually &lt; $25.  Changing it depends on how easy it is to get to and how comfortable you are with draining some radiator fluid and refilling it.</p>

  <p>Ok so the file should for all uk cars, even the russian one is
  incredibly similar.</p>
  
  <p>I recommend you use a stylus for this, (I used a pen with the lid on)</p>
  
  <p>1) Download ClientAppInfo.bin from here
  <a href=""https://mega.nz/#!Rs0QiBAD!NWVV3Xy5RJwSomJkwW-ZgIMoWUlzcZZpT2lOjocm4ww"">https://mega.nz/#!Rs0QiBAD!NWVV3Xy5RJwSomJkwW-ZgIMoWUlzcZZpT2lOjocm4ww</a> This is the one

  - Go into the MD folder, this is your pendrive
  - Press on the file so it is highlighted, in the toolbar at the top click edit and then copy (you'll understand why I say use a stylus it's small) </p>
  
  <p>6.5) Change folder options
  - In the toolbar press View and select options
  - Untick all the options shown and press ok</p>
  
  <p>7) Replace the original file
  - At the middle of the toolbar on the top is a yellow folder press it and you should return to the my device screen with all the folders
  - Navigate to /Storage Card/System
  - In the top toolbar press Edit and then Paste, It will ask do you want to override the file, press yes.
  - Wait for it to copy</p>
  
  <p>8) Restart Car
  - Remove the pen drive
  - Turn off your car and wait for the handbrake light to turn off, this can take around 30 seconds be patient
  - Turn it back on and in the apps you should see Mirrorlink</p>

"Can a blown head gasket cause overheating, without losing coolant?","23731","","<p>My 2006 Subaru Outback overheated when my wife was driving. I got to the car that evening and its radiator was pretty low.  I refilled it, and the car ran fine for a week.  Then it overheated again.  Our mechanic says we have a blown head gasket.  We need to wait before we can pay for that repair, so we took it home for now.</p>

<p>I drove it today.  It ran fine for a few hours, then rapidly started getting hot.  I opened the cap and let it boil, filled the radiator (it took about a half gallon), and kept driving.  It overheated again in about five minutes.</p>

<p>This happened about four times over 15 miles - It would suddenly get hot after approximately five minutes of easy driving; I would open the radiator and let it boil off; refilled it with water; and kept driving towards home.  It had just started getting hot again when I got home and parked.</p>

<p>Anyway, here's what is confusing me.  After it cooled off, I opened the cap (without it needing to boil off), and the radiator was still full!  Perhaps most of the coolant I lost on the way home was simply due to my opening the hot radiator and letting it boil... It does lose a bit of coolant even when it isn't overheating, but that might be a hose leak.</p>

<p>Can this behavior be explained by a bad head gasket?  The system can obviously hold pressure.  I'm wondering if the thermostat is bad instead.  Maybe both problems exist.</p>

<p>Thanks for any insight.</p>
","<p>Yes, it's possible. Also, the bit you lost that you think may be a leaking pipe is actually being turned to steam and blown out your exhaust. The car runs fine until the engine gets hot enough for the thermostat to open up, at which point exhaust gases are let into the radiator. The details of how/why is a bit long, but this is what happens. How do I know this? the 2006 Outback uses the same engine as the 2006 Forester and Impreza models. And those engines all had headgasket problems. My Forester did exactly the same. The symptoms are always the same:</p>

<ul>
<li>Overheating</li>
<li>sytematic loss of coolant</li>
<li>pressure in the radiator</li>
<li>bubbles in the radiator when the thermostat opens</li>
</ul>

<p>The headgasket is feeble and tears between the cylinder and waterjacket, sucking coolant into the cylinder and blowing some exhaust into the coolant system. An updated headgasket should be installed.</p>

<p>If you want to make dead sure that you don't have any cooling problems again, you should save up some money and have a mishimoto radiator installed in place of the floppy plastic one you have currently. It's not urgent, but it should be done before 120 thousand miles/200 thousand kilometers.</p>

"Durability of automatic transmission boxes versus durability of manual transmission boxes?

He thinks that it is impossible to maintain an automatic transmission box. Hence he is avoiding all cars with automatic transmissions -- I am very skeptical about this.</p>

<p><em>What are the lifetimes of automatic transmission boxes and manual transmission boxes? By which actions you can increase the lifetime of an automatic transmission box? Is it more expensive to maintain a car with automatic-transmission than a car with a manual transmission?</em></p>
","<p>They will probably work out to be the same. </p>

<p>An automatic transmission is inherently more complicated which means more can go wrong and usually does (more so than manuals). The increased complexity also makes them more expensive, heavier, less fuel efficient etc.</p>

<p>A manual transmission is less complicated which means there is less that can go wrong. Through normal use a manual transmission should far outlive an automatic transmission with regards to absolute lifespan. HOWEVER, a manual transmission requires the use of a clutch which will wear out quite quickly relative to an automatic transmissions life-cycle. If you are not able to replace a clutch yourself (which requires removing the transmission) then you will be paying quite a bit more maintenance on the manual transmission every time the clutch wears out (anywhere from 2-8 years). With the automatic transmission there is less high ticket maintenance required besides fluid flushes. If your automatic transmission dies however then it will probably be at-least $1000 more expensive than the equivalent manual transmission to replace.</p>

<p>So it probably depends how long he wants to keep the vehicle and whether he cares about having to replace clutches or is able to do that himself to save money.</p>

Is it just that the leak will get worse and eventually I won't be able to get the A/C to work at all, without repairing it?

","<p>If it were mine and I could get by with one to two charges a season (3 - 4 months) I wouldn't do anything but that, and I can fix it myself. Once it gets worse than that I would fix it.</p>

<p>Getting to the bulb is often harder - it varies a lot by car. I think the Focus is a more traditional design, so hopefully you can get to it without having to dismantle the car. On the back of the headlamp will be a round cover, these usually have a bayonet type fitment, so you twist them and pull to remove - providing you can actually get to it in the first place!</p>

<p>Once in, pull the plug off the back of the bulb, and you'll find a wire spring clip holding the bulb in - remove this (which can be tricky, depending on how much access you've got), and the bulb should fall out.</p>

<p>Fit the new bulb, making sure <strong>not</strong> to touch the glass with your fingers - the grease from your fingerprints can cause the bulb to fail prematurely. Refit the spring clip (again, a tricky job), and the plug and cover. Refit anything you had to remove to get to it...</p>

"What is the name of the part to which the gas cap connects?","23001","","<p>I'm trying to find a replacement part for a 2005 Saturn ION.</p>

<p>There seems to be some detachable receptacle type thing to which the gas cap screws in. The gas cap itself is fine, but one of the plastic tabs that holds this receptacle in place has snapped off, and now the entire receptacle is loose and can come out of the gas tank. This exposes the entry point for gasoline into the gas tank, which I assume is fairly dangerous.</p>

<p>When I search for parts, all that I can seem to find is the cap itself, which I do not need. I need the part to which the cap screws in.</p>

<p>Does anyone know what this part might be more appropriately named?</p>

"2005 Dodge Ram: Easy way to diagnose code P0420?","22871","","<p>My truck is reporting a code P0420, which apparently is ""Catalyst System Efficiency Below Threshold (Bank 1)"" which can either be the catalytic converter or the rear O2 sensor.  The code came on at about 30k miles, so I doubt it's the converter.  So my question is, is there a way I can test the O2 sensor without a ""scan"" tool or oscilloscope?  I'd rather not have to buy a new O2 sensor just to see if the old one is not working.</p>

<p>This is on a 5.7L Hemi V8.</p>
","<p>I've diagnosed this condition many times with a vehicle-specific scan tool, and I don't think it can be done without this or an oscilloscope. O2 sensors work in the range of less than 1 volt (.2v to .7v) In particular, the rear O2 sensor should stay at a fairly constant .5v if the cat is working right. Wild swings to the extremes indicate the cat isn't working.</p>

<p>The voltage fluctuates rapidly and is so small that a normal DVOM won't work well (it will average the readings). I suppose a analog meter with a small enough scale may work, but you'd have to pierce the insulation, as all of the wires have to stay plugged in for reference voltage purposes.</p>

<p>It's also possible that it's an intermittent problem, in which case historical data and real-time data while driving the car becomes important.</p>

<p>A gas analyzer would tell you about the efficiency of the cat, but that's even more of a hassle than a scan tool..</p>

<p>Edit: If you have two rear O2 sensors, and they have the same connector and wire lengths, you can swap them. Then reset the engine codes (disconnect battery) and drive it until the light comes back on. See if the error code went to a different bank. If so, it is unlikely that you have two faulty sensors, and the problem is the cat or something else up the line from the sensor.</p>

<p>You can also check the physical condition of the sensor and make sure there isn't corrosion/water/oil in the connector.</p>

"When given a choice between octane 89 and 93, which should I choose?","22723","","<p>I just recently got a 2005 Volvo S40 with a turbo engine; I want to take good care of it, so naturally, when the instruction manual recommends 91 octane fuel but says it takes a minimum of 87, I have no problem with buying 91, knowing (or at least <em>believing</em>) that it's better for my engine and improves performance and fuel efficiency compared to just shoving regular unleaded into its tank. I checked online, read a bit about engine knocking and whatnot, and was determined that's what I'd do, and the previous seller also filled it with premium gas so it has been well taken care of thus far.</p>

<p>This morning I stopped at a local gas station to refill it for the first time. My fuel octane choices were 87, 89, or 93. Oh no! I probably should have hopped back in my car and went looking for a ""normal"" gas station, with premium at 91 octane... But instead I just choice 89 and made a mental note to ask this question.</p>

<p>Should I have chosen 93? Or would that have been ""too much""? Is it better to choose a bit higher or a bit lower? Could one be more harmful than the other to my engine?</p>

<p>I'm in the USA if it matters.</p>
","<p>Being in the midst of summer, I may have erred on the side of caution and gone with the 93 but I'm sure the 89 hasn't been harmful to your vehicle if the manual states you can put 87 into it.</p>

<p>Since you mentioned knocking, it sounds like you have already done some research.  Still, to cover it, the higher rated octane fuel is essentially ""harder"" to ignite and so is called for in either high compression engines or when using forced induction (turbocharger or supercharger).</p>

<p>A lower octane fuel can have the tendency to ignite prematurely which is called knocking or detonation.  This can cause many different issues as your pistons and valves will not be at the right positions for the proper engine rotation.</p>

<p>Since your car's manual says it will take 87 but recommends 91, most likely it has a knock sensor that when it detects early detonation it changes characteristics of the engine's operation to prevent further knocking.  This will prevent damage to the engine, but at the cost of performance and possibly fuel efficiency.</p>

<p>The reason I said erring on the side of caution with the 93 for summer is that depending on where your engine really falls in its need for 91 for optimal performance, 89 may or may not trip the knock sensor and cause that degraded state.  One factor that will impact it on a turbocharged engine is the charged air temperature, which in the summer is already starting at a higher temperature.</p>

"Ford Ranger Clutch Suddenly Has No Pressure","22578","","<p>I recently (about 3 months ago) got my clutch replaced in my '97 Ford Ranger, and when i was driving it yesterday, the clutch suddenly stopped working. I was in gear when it happened and was able to shift shortly after (didn't think anything of it) but then I was stuck in 3rd gear, and pressing the clutch did nothing from there. Had to get truck towed.</p>

<p>Best way to describe it is lack of resistance/pressure when pressing the clutch. From what I'm reading online it sounds like I may need to bleed the clutch? Is this correct? The fact that it was just suddenly bad makes me fear that it may be something more?</p>

<p>Any advice is appreciated, thanks!</p>
","<p>If there is no resistance to the pedal, I'd suspect a hydraulic problem.</p>

<p>Check the fluid level in the master cylinder (which should be the opposite side of the bulkhead to the pedal, and will look like a smaller, simpler version of the brake cylinder). If it is low or empty, you have a leak. If it is still full, you most likely have a problem with the master cylinder, or an airlock in the system.</p>

<p>If there is a leak, the fault will be either in the pipe(s) or the slave cylinder. You might be able to see signs of fluid where it leaked - if not, refill &amp; bleed it, and get an assistant to press the pedal as you check for leaks (be careful, as fluid could spurt out under pressure!)</p>

<p>It is unusual for an airlock to suddenly appear, and they usually manifest as limited resistance rather than none at all - you'd find that the pedal did nothing for much of its travel, then got harder once you had compressed the air enough.</p>

<p>Master cylinder issues can be harder to diagnose, as they can fail without leaking externally, and simply allow the fluid to freely pass between the reservoir and pressure sides of the cylinder. </p>

<li>Temporarily disconnect the MAF to clear the error code.</li>
<li>Force a DPF regen using something like FORScan.</li>

<p>So after several hours under the bonnet this weekend I can answer the questions above in the hope that this is useful to anyone else suffering from DPF issues with a Ford.</p>

<ol>
<li>Yes, that is the EGR valve. The piece you can see with the barcode is the stepper motor, and the valve is directly underneath.  </li>
<li>I can't see anything to suggest this is illegal in the UK. The consensus seems to be that on a diesel engine nobody will notice/care.</li>
<li>The MAF is actually under the label in the original diagram. See the updated one below.</li>
<li>Yes it is safe to disconnect it. The ECU will complain, but it doesn't cause any harm to the engine.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here's the updated diagram labeling the parts:</p>

<p>The EGR valve was covered in a thick black gunk which I removed with a strong degreaser (don't put it on the stepper motor!) and gave it a shot of WD40 to make it smooth. I also gently cleaned the MAF using some MAF cleaner.</p>

<p><strong>Unfortunately</strong> this has not solved the issue for me and the error is still occurring. I have now ordered a blanking plate like the one shown below and will fit this next to see if the error is resolved.</p>

"Why (almost) all dirt bikes have single cylinder engine?","22507","","<p>Every dirt bike i know has a single cylinder engine.  I myself ride a Yamaha XT660Z which has a huge 660 cc cylinder.  </p>

<p>What are the characteristics of those engines? what are the benefits of such design?</p>

<p>Another interesting topic is that a lot of the engines used in dirt bikes are 2 stroke engines.  What are the pros/cons of such engines compared to 4 stroke?</p>
","<p>The main reason for the use of a 2-stroke engine is it accelerates much faster than a similarly sized 4-stroke engine. The obvious reason for this is a 2-stroke cylinder fires on every revolution of the crank shaft, while a 4-stroke does it every <em>other</em> revolution. Also because the 2-stroke fires on every revolution, they only need enough weight to balance the engine. A 4-stroke engine needs added weight in the crank shaft to allow it to keep running during the non-firing stroke. This applies mainly when the engine is running in the lower RPM ranges. Due to the added weight, it takes the engine longer to increase speed from the lower to higher RPM ranges.  </p>

<p>These engines are also primarily air cooled. Having a single cylinder engine air cooled is a lot more efficient than trying to cool a two (or more) cylinder air-cooled engine. Air cooled is a simpler solution than is water cooled.</p>

<p>A single cylinder engine is a lot simpler than a two cylinder engine, whether 2- or 4-stroke. There are just a lot less moving parts. </p>

<p>There is no issue with why larger is better ... it goes back to the old saying of <em>There is no replacement for displacement.</em> Having more displacement, whether 2- or 4-stroke is going to provide more low end torque. </p>

<p>Due to the way most 2-strokes fill the cylinder with air/fuel mixture, they are inherently less efficient than a 4-stroke engine is. The volumetric efficiency of a naturally aspirated 2-stroke limits its ability to make power. A similarly sized 4-stroke can fill the cylinder a lot more completely, allowing it to make a lot more power. For the edification of those who may not know, a 2-stroke engine only has a reed valve which functions as a check valve to allow for the correct air/exhaust flow. The inlet for the air/fuel is through low in the cylinder port(s) on one side of the cylinder. These inlets are at the position where, as the piston travels down in the cylinder, these ports are uncovered to allow the air/fuel mixture to enter the cylinder. As the piston travels back up the cylinder, the port(s) are closed off, which allows for the compression of the air/fuel mixture just prior to ignition. As the piston travels down the cylinder, it gets to the exhaust port(s) first, which are also in the side of the cylinder, only opposite the intake ports. The pistons are usually specifically shaped to direct the outgoing exhaust and incoming air/fuel mixture in the correct direction so the engine will actually function (instead of say the exhaust going out the intake port). In comparison, a 4-stroke piston is relatively flat (there are exceptions). Here's a pretty good representation of the two strokes and piston shape:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wbkTV.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>With a dirt bike, having the low end torque you need to dig your way out of a tight turn, then having the ability to get up to speed quickly ... that's where it's at. A 2-stroke engine can do both of these for a bike, at the cost of efficiency in the process.</p>

"What exactly is Honda's i-VTEC technology","22393","","<p>I see that almost all of Honda's cars have an ""i-VTEC"" logo at the back. I googled it and came to know that it has something to do with different cam profiles.</p>

<p>Can someone explain? A diagram or animation would be helpful.</p>

<p>And why does Honda do it?</p>
","<p>In addition to Zaid's answer.<br>

In essence, it selects between two different cam profiles depending on the RPM.<br>
Here's an animation -<br>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/mkOtD.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""><br>
This is how a cam controls poppet valves. Read about <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cam profile here</a></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TW5tN.gif"" alt=""cam""> </p>

<p>For volumetric efficiency we want the intake stroke to fill the cylinder with the max - air-fuel.<br>
I'l jump to the need for having a different cam profile at higher RPM's  </p>

<p><strong>Valve Timing</strong>   </p>

<p><strong>Intake</strong> -  Valve isn't open long enough for the air (or air-fuel mix) to completely fill up the cylinder under the given pressure gradient. 
We could help this situation by using a different cam profile which allows the cam to be open for longer. This means the intake valve is open even after the piston reaches the bottom of the intake stroke. Air at this velocity has sufficient momentum to continue to push and compress into the cylinder even as the piston is moving up for the compression stroke.</p>

<p><strong>Exhaust</strong> - we could do something clever here as well. If we open the intake stroke as well (overlap) at the end of the exhaust stroke we end up using the momentum of the exhaust to suck in air from the intake port!  </p>

<p><strong>LIFT</strong><br>
Lift control basically equates to changing the effective area of the 'hole'. At higher RPM's we would benefit by using a bigger 'hole' and hence the cam profile is such that it also pushes the poppets deeper. Since the size of the port is a tuned parameter, using a bigger hole all the time will result in the engine running rough.<br>
So vtec's switch between two distinct cam profiles which is selected by the ecu depending on the RPM. There is a distinct surge that can be felt at the switch-over point.<br>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZpcWj.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>But of course we could benefit even further by having a continuous control over lift and timing.  </p>

<p>Is there any practical difference between brake, carb &amp; throttle body cleaners?</p>

<p>I go through a lot of brake cleaner and usually don't have enough in stock. Is it possible to substitute it with either carb or TB cleaner? Based on smell alone, I wouldn't imagine so; it seems like the brake cleaner is very dilute in comparison.</p>

<p>Carb and TB cleaners seem quite concentrated. I don't have any carburetors to clean, so could I use the can up to clean throttle bodies instead without any concerns?</p>
","<p>I have seen quite bit of traffic on the internet about the differences. As with what Steve said, there isn't much. A lot of the things which people are saying are things like: ""Carb cleaner leaves a residue, while brake cleaner doesn't"". I pulled the Data Safety Sheet for both of the CRC cleaners (trying to keep apples-to-apples here):</p>

<p>Carb Cleaner:</p>

<p>There is a lot less Toluene and Acetone in the brake cleaner than there is in the carb cleaner, so I can suggest there would be less of a propensity for these chemicals to hang around. </p>

<p>According to Google, Toluene is a colorless, water-insoluble liquid with the smell associated with paint thinners. It is a mono-substituted benzene derivative, consisting of a CH₃ group attached to a phenyl group. Acetone is a colorless, volatile, flammable liquid, and is the simplest ketone. I'm not a chemist, but believe either of these could leave a residue behind if left in sufficient quantities. Since the brake cleaner has much less of them, it would seem the parts cleaned with these would have far less of a chance to have a left behind residue. This seems to hold true with the internet gab going on.</p>

"Wheel offset effect on performance","22348","","<p>When it comes to upgrading wheels and tires, drivers tend to have two different goals in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>Improving their vehicle's handling/performance</li>
<li>Improving their vehicle's appearance </li>
</ul>

<p>A lower positive wheel offset will typically result in the wheels being more flush to the fender, giving the vehicle a more aggressive look. A lot of people that choose a much lower offset end up modifying other components on their cars to compensate for fitment (i.e., rolling fenders, adjusting camber).</p>

<p>To what effect does moving away from the stock wheel offset have on the performance of the vehicle? Is it generally a wise idea to stay as close as possible to the stock offset? And does a lower offset have any benefit on the handling and driveability of the car?</p>
","<p>Offset is one of a number of measurements applicable to a road wheel and it describes the distance from the centre line of the wheel which the mounting face of the hub is.</p>

<p>As a practical example, lets consider a 6J wheel (a wheel which is 6 inches wide).  Offset is usually quoted as ""ET"" followed by an optional mathematical sign (+/-) and a number.  A wheel with an offset of ET0 is described as a zero offset wheel.  This therefore means that our 6J wheel will have an equal 3"" of wheel sticking out infront of the hub and 3"" of wheel sitting back over the brake disc.  Offset is quoted in millimeters (mm) so for ease of conversion, a wheel with an offset of ET+25 will effectively be recessed into the arch by ~1"" so will protrude 2"" with 4"" over the brake disc.  Conversely a wheel with an offset of ET-25 (negative offset) will be pushed out closer to the wheel arch so will have 4"" of wheel protruding from the hub and only 2"" over the brake disc.</p>

<p>There are a number of reasons why you may wish to deviate from manufacturers standard offset.  You may wish to fit wider wheels and encounter clearance issues with the rear face of the wheel touching the suspension leg at standard offset.</p>

<p>You may, as stated wish to give the car a more aggressive look so that the wheels and tyres appear to ""fill"" the arches better.</p>

<p>The effect on handling of deviation from manufacturers offset is to increase effective levels of grip whilst sacrificing a certain level of feel.  More performance variants of cars employ something called ""wide track"".  Track refers to the width between the wheels measured across an axle.  For example, the Mk3 Golf VR6 used different front wishbones and ball joints to effectively push the wheels further out into the arches than the standard car.</p>

<p>What a wider track does is mean that cornering forces can be more effectively coped with by the outside tyres.  Consider a push bike, very unstable and easy to push over.  Add stabilizers to the bike and it now becomes harder to push over.  Imagine increasing the width from the bike that these stabilizers extend and you will see how it becomes harder and harder to push over.</p>

<p>The trade-off however is that when a standard road car approaches the limits of traction it is very communicative to the driver through the steering feel that it's about to loose grip and progressively break away from it's intended line.  If the driver presses on they may unsettle and ultimately loose control of the car.  With a wide track car the limits are approached at a higher speed and the amount of information fed back to the driver is a lot shorter before the car breaks traction completely.  Consider how many Porsche 911's are damaged on wet roads because they have such a high level of grip but it goes away very very quickly.</p>

<p>Related slightly to this answer is the fact that certain tuners use spacers to increase the track of the car which has the same nett effect as altering wheel offset as it pushes the wheel out by the width of the spacer from the hub.</p>

<p>One final note is that running a wide track through offset or spacers typically accelerates wear on wheel bearings.</p>

"brake squeal and grinding rotor even if I had just installed new pads","22292","","<p>I have just noticed that my brakes started squealing non stop even though the pads are fairly new (8 months with just 7,000 km on it). Also I have just noticed last night that one of the brakes is grinding onto my rotor(kinda feels that way), and that it makes this very bad low grinding noise. What seems to be the problem for this?</p>

<p>I want to be at least informed before I bring this to the mechanic as I need to be at least prepared(financially) before I bring it there, or otherwise it might get stuck at the garage for a long time. I am currently not using the car as I plan to have it fixed as soon as I have the resources to do so.</p>

<p>My car is a 1995 toyota corolla with 130000 km. Only pads have been replaced in the brake components. </p>
","<p>You stated that ""<em>Only pads have been replaced in the brake components.</em>"" If the rotors were not turned (machined) or replaced at the same time, this could be a problem. The surface of the rotor needs to be fresh, or the brakes will not work up to expectations.</p>

<p>Also, consideration must be given to the proper ""bedding"" of the brakes. If they were not bedded properly, any one of the four pads could be worn down to nothing already causing the noise/issue you are talking about. (For proper bedding technique, <a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/11244/is-it-normal-for-stop-distance-to-be-long-on-brand-new-brake-pads/11245#11245"">read this thread</a> ... pay attention to the links). Not bedding the brakes correctly can cause premature wear of the brake pads, or even pulsing which may feel like a warped rotor.</p>

<p>Another thing to check is to see if a dust shield hasn't been bent for some reason and is now rubbing on the rotor. In this case, it could sound an awful lot like the ""squealer"" sounds when it starts rubbing.</p>

<p>Something else to contemplate is you might have a bad wheel bearing, which could cause the hub to lean over slightly, causing issues like you are describing. This could happen, but is really an outside possibility.</p>

"When car is standing still, I smell Diesel exhaust. Why?","22170","","<p>In my 2003 Opel Vectra, <strong>the cabin air smells of Diesel exhaust while stopped at e.g. a red light.</strong><br>
The exhaust smell goes away when driving, and it also doesn't come back if I turn the ventilation off before stopping at a light. It's not temperature-related: it happens whether it's cold or warm outside, and also whether or not the engine has reached its normal operating temperature. It also happens whether or not the A/C function of the ventilation system is turned on. The car's windows are always closed.</p>

<p>It seems to me that there is some problem with the car's ventilation and/or exhaust system. I'm fairly sure it's not a problem with the A/C itself as it's not a chemical odor but clearly an exhaust smell.</p>

<p>Asking the dealer, he told me that the car has a Diesel-powered auxilary heater that engages when it's cold outside and the engine isn't warm yet. While that heater is working, the heated cabin air might have a weak Diesel smell.<br>
- This explanation would make sense to me if it <em>didn't</em> happen in the summer too (when the aux heater is presumably not used), and if it <em>did</em> happen while driving, but neither is the case.</p>

"Brakes locking up when backing up","22045","","<p>I have a 2002 Kia Sportage that was being driven only once a week or so for a couple of months, then it sat for a whole month without being driven. The dashboard brake light had been coming on momentarily when coming to a stop at stop lights. I didn't know what it meant at the time (but now know that was an indication that the brake fluid was getting low). When I went to drive it after it had sat for a month, the brake pedal would go to the floor and give almost no braking action. When I realized that the brake fluid was below the ""min"" line, I added some brake fluid to bring the level between ""min"" and ""max"", took it for a test drive, but still no improvement. I then visually inspected the brake lines from the master cylinder back to each wheel but didn't notice any obvious signs of leakage. So I bled the lines (only did the rear 2 wheels...front two wheels had bleeder screws stuck) and it turns out there was quite a bit of air in the lines. The brake pedal regained its firmness after that so I decided to take it for a test drive. The only weird thing was that when I put the car in reverse, it felt like the brakes were seized somewhere and the car wouldn't go backwards. I let off the gas, and heard a clicking sound like something released. The car then reversed properly, and I took it for a 10-minute test drive around town and everything seemed good with the brakes again.</p>

<p>A couple days later I go to test drive it again, and the sticking-brakes thing happened again. I put it in reverse, brakes seemed like they were locked up somewhere, let off the gas, heard a click (sounded like it came from rear passenger side wheel?), and then everything seemed normal again. I drove up the street, pulled into a parking spot, backed up with no problem this time, and returned. I decided to go for a second lap, had no problem backing up again, but after getting down the street and pulling into another parking space to back up and turn around, this time the car wouldn't go in reverse at all. It would let me creep forward (brakes dragging), but in reverse it was hard-locked-up. After trying forward-reverse about 10 times, something finally released and I was able to back up and return to my parking spot (no sign of brakes dragging or any other problems on the return drive).</p>

<p>This is a rear-wheel-drive car with front discs and rear drums (manual transmission). There is a possibility that the brake fluid is very slightly overfilled as I had topped it up to just above (or right at) the ""max"" fluid line in the master cylinder reservoir while I was bleeding the system (this was because I was moving to the right front wheel to bleed it down, but couldn't loosen that bleeder screw, so never got to bleed the front lines...since the fluid looked like it was right at the ""max"" line, I just left it without draining any off).</p>

<p>What is the most likely source of the problem? What should I check or try next?</p>

<hr>

<p>UPDATE (4/9/2014)
I pulled the rear wheels and opened up the drums to look around. There was <em>possibly</em> some fluid leakage inside the rear passenger side drum, but it wasn't conclusive. Unfortunately, I made a beginner's mistake and stepped on the brake pedal while the drums were off which pushed the piston out of the rear driver's side cylinder and sprayed brake fluid everywhere. So I ended up replacing both rear wheel cylinders re-bleeding the brakes (rear wheels only...front bleeder screws still stuck).</p>

<p>I took it for a test drive, and although it wasn't locking up in reverse, it would give a noticeable click as soon as the car started moving backwards. This time I didn't have the kids in the car so it was much quieter, and it seems to me like the clicking noise is coming from the front passenger side wheel (I did the forward-backward thing about 20 times to try to be sure). I also drove around the neighborhood with the windows down, and it seems like I'm getting a faint but noticeable scraping sound about once a wheel revolution from that same front passenger side wheel.</p>

<p>Any suggestions on what to try next when I pull the front wheel off? Should I take the effort to get the front bleeder screws unstuck so I can bleed the front wheels? Is it possible I have a sticking front caliper, and if so, what should I do or check for that?</p>

<hr>

<p>UPDATE (4/28/2014)
So after the 4/9/2014 update where I thought the problem had stopped, it started happening again and the brakes would be locked up when trying to back the car up. There wasn't anything wrong with the front wheel after all. The problem was in the rear passenger side drum brakes. James' answer (below) was exactly right.</p>

<p>I had noticed that when I parked the car, the longer it sat, the harder it would be locked up when I tried to back it up the next time. If I only let it sit for a couple of hours, I could back the car up, but it would ""stick"" a bit then make the loud click before moving backwards. If I let it sit for 4-5 hours, it would stick a bit harder, but would still release with a loud click when backing up. If I let it sit overnight or for a couple of days, it would be completely stuck, and would only free up if I rocked the car back and forwards a number of times. I tested by leaving it parked overnight without the hand brake engaged (manual transmission), and sure enough, in the morning nothing was stuck and I could back up with no problem.</p>

<p>I opened everything up again and noticed that the backing plate on the rear passenger side did have a fair amount of rust in parts, but the part I should have noticed earlier was that the three contact points where the brake shoes rest against the backing plate all had grooves etched in them that were the exact shape of the metal on the shoes. So the brake shoes were coming to rest in these little grooves. Not only that, but these grooves were rusty too, so the longer the shoes would sit stationary in those grooves, the more the corrosion would cause everything to hang up and stick together. </p>

<p>I couldn't get the backing plates off without a special Kia tool, so I just reconditioned them by sanding off all the corrosion with sandpaper, paying special attention to the contact points and the grooves that had been etched in them. Once I got a smooth surface again, I repainted the backing plate with <a href=""http://www.rustoleum.com/product-catalog/consumer-brands/auto/specialty-paints/high-heat"" rel=""nofollow"">high temperature auto paint</a>, let everything thoroughly dry, and reassembled.</p>

<p>The car backs up perfectly smoothly now and I don't even get the clicking sound anymore, even when the car sits overnight. I'm pretty sure the clicking sound was the sound of the brake shoes ""popping out"" of the grooves that were etched into the backing plate by the shoes.</p>
","<p>It looks like your car may have drum brakes as an option.  If so and if you left the parking brake on while it was parked corrosion may have caused one of the pads to freeze partly in place.  </p>

<p>Pull the rear brake drums and see if everything is moving as it should. </p>

"Change calipers on both sides?","21598","","<p>Four months ago, I had a seized brake in the front left. 
The slide bearing was stuck and the outer pad was worn more than the inner (at the piston). I wasn't able to move the journals of the bearing by hand and used a tool to get it moving again.
Since cleaning the bearings didn't help, I removed any rust / oxidation from the holes with sandpaper, cleaned them,  and assembled new journals with lots of that special grease shipped with them.</p>

<p>However, the problem is back again, and I'm thinking about replacing the entire caliper to get rid of the problem.</p>

<p><strong>Should calipers be replaced on both sides, though there's just a problem on one side, as it's done for tires, pads and rotors?</strong></p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> 
Car is a small Kia Picanto (BA) 2008, just made 100,000km</p>

<p>The calipers seem to be a single, solid part, without exchangeable bearings (the ""hole""). As said, I already changed the journals (the movable part inside the hole) with temporary success, the brake is now running hot again. Hardly noticeable at low speed, but at 130-140km/h, I sometimes can hear that noise of a hot / worn brake again and the brake is significantly hotter than the one on the other wheel after that. (Also strange: sometimes, the noise is there at 120km/h, sometimes at 140km/h, sometimes, there is none)</p>

<p>Finally, I don't want to mess with new journals again, and have the same problem in some months. The brake got really hot last time, and I would like to replace it. I can get it for 100€, which is not so much compared to 17€ for new journals.</p>
","<p>There is no need for replacing the callipers together, as they will be heavy on your pocket, the reason why the pads and rotors are replaced together is since they work in tandem and working by rubbing against each other. </p>

<p>The callipers on the other hand float over the entire assembly so there is no real point of changing them.</p>

<p>You <strong>might need to change them both</strong> there is a contamination in the brake fluid since there are chances they might block the piston so if one is affected the definitely the other will be affected.

<p>To put it simply if the callipers are not jammed then there is no need to change them together.</p>

<p>To answer your question.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is the motorcycle equivalent of OBD-II?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Essentially, many motorcycles conform to the CAN BUS protocol they just don't have an OBDII connector, they will have their own proprietary connector and you can buy converters for the various manufacturers that do support the protocol standard and use your OBDII scan tool to retrieve information.  </p>

<p>Since there has not been a regulatory component mandating standardization the various connection types have become proprietary as manufacturers try to maintain their closed end to end systems.</p>

<p><strong>Other Proprietary Systems</strong></p>

<p>There are some motorcycle manufacturers such as Suzuki that have maintained their own proprietary systems.  Suzuki's implementation of an on-board diagnostic system is called Suzuki Diagnostic System or SDS.  It uses it's own proprietary protocol on the wire.  Much like Microsoft did in the 80's and 90's with LANMan and Apple did with AppleTalk network protocols before full adoption of TCP/IP as global network protocol standard.</p>

<p>There are other examples of proprietary BUS network protocols but too many to list.  The above list with CAN BUS implementations is not a full list, just citing a few examples of conformity to a standard.</p>

<p>In the future, companies like Bosch, Siemens and NGK are driving standards but it may be quite a few years before full adoption is achieved.  Cost reduction for overall compliance is one of the drivers for the hold out manufacturers and with more than likely drive compliance as CAN BUS costs are reduced to the point where lack of adoption does not make financial sense anymore.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, Google searches for  (insert manufacturer name"", ""can bus"", programmer yield a plethora of hits for hiring programmers for Ducati and Harley Davidson  Most of the good information is hidden by password protected portals for dealers and certified technicians.</p>

","<p>You probably have a wheel out of balance and it's difficult to determine that without putting the tires on a balancer. One thing you could try would be to jack up the car and put pencil on a stationary object like a brick or a board move the pencil so it almost touches the wheel, spin the tire and look for the rim moving in and out in reference with the pencil. That's really only going to give you a starting point though because if you have movement it could be a bent hub or axle and may or may not be the source of vibration.</p>

<p>The aftermath of the crash shows how the modern ""crumple zones"" almost completely protect the driver's area in the 2009 whereas the 1959 driver would certainly be badly crushed.</p>

<p>In addition to crumple zones built into the frame, there are other thoughtful features like collapsible steering columns and as a high tech option the car will call and report the accident to emergency responders for you.</p>

<p><em>From the comments (thanks tallpaul):</em> here is <a href=""https://youtu.be/HCecdOBCFjI?t=326"" rel=""noreferrer"">another video</a> of a 1980 Volvo and a 2000 Renault.  Not classic per se but it does show a marked difference in technology even in that 20 year span.</p>

<p><strong>Anti-lock Braking Systems</strong></p>

<p>Modern cars also come with ABS which reduces stopping distances while maintaining a level of steering control.  The difference between the car sliding to an uncontrolled stop and quickly slowing down while being able to steer around obstacles or even to just stay on the road is huge.</p>

<p><strong>Restraint Systems</strong></p>

<p>Cars from the 60s and earlier don't even have a 3-point seatbelt (shoulder belts), but modern cars are required to have them, and many also have seatbelt tensioning systems that tighten the belt and hold you in the seat in an emergency.</p>

<p>In addition to better belts modern cars also have several airbags to cushion the occupants in an accident.</p>

","<p>In Ohio unlike other states a bill of sale is not required. The car should have a title and that title is on file at the title bureau. You will fill the title out and take it to a notary to get signed. Exchange the title and car for the money. The new owner will take the title to the title bureau and pay the sales tax on the price filled out on the title to get a new title with their name. </p>

"Doing my own fuel induction service - how to, and how difficult?","21277","","<p>I was recommended to get a fuel induction service for a 2002 V4 Camry, and am considering doing it MYSELF. The reasons for considering this are:</p>

<ol>
<li>My car idles a bit rough, especially when the AC is on.</li>
<li>A dealer-mechanic recommended it for reason #1, and for the fact that my car has 125k miles on it and it couldn't hurt!</li>
<li>The article linked to below has some interesting information on the subject.</li>
</ol>

<p>My question is:</p>

<p><strong>How should I do it such that it has the most benefit, and how hard would it be?</strong></p>

<p>Update: Studies have shown that carbon build-up, especially in older direct-injected cars, to cause performance issues. See the following for example: <a href=""http://www.dailytech.com/Direct+Injected+Engines+from+Some+Automakers+are+Seeing+Reduced+Performance/article21962.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailytech.com/Direct+Injected+Engines+from+Some+Automakers+are+Seeing+Reduced+Performance/article21962.htm</a></p>

<p>Update 2: After some more research and talking to a dealer, the ""fuel induction service"" is where they pour chemicals / cleaning agents directly into the injectors and let it sit for 30 minutes or so. That is significantly different from pouring SeaFoam or other agents into the gas tank, and having them significantly diluted.</p>

<p>Obviously this is one method. But I'm curious if it actually makes sense to pull the injectors out and clean them, as one poster sarcastically suggests? If we're talking 30+ HP I'm all for it.</p>

<p><strong>FINISHED: </strong></p>

<p>I completed my own induction service over the weekend. The process took about 45 minutes (it was my first time). I went on to do it to our van and it took about 20 minutes :)</p>

<p>I accepted Larry's answer because he provided the most thorough explanation of the process. I did not follow his process completely, however, since I did not have the tools for one of the steps.</p>

<p>My solution was to detach the air intake hose and inject SeaFoam directly into the throttle body. I ran the RPM's at ~1,500 for a few minutes during this process. It took a bit of time before all of the SeaFoam was cleared out.</p>

<p>End result: </p>

<ol>
<li>Idling is now smooth.</li>
<li>Engine is smoother under heavy acceleration (surprised at that, actually).</li>
<li>More power, significant enough that I can tell the difference. The way I tested this was going from 45-65 on the highway as if to pass. I don't mash the pedal so the car stays in the same gear and only pushes the engine. It was able to do that without dropping a gear (it would drop a gear before).</li>
</ol>
","<p>You still haven't answered the question ""Why do <strong>YOU</strong> want to do this?"" I can provide you a better answer if I have that information.</p>

<p>I have been in the automotive repair business for more that 20 years and have sold and done many induction services. They work, but only if you need them. I used several systems and they all are comparable in results but vary greatly in price. </p>

<p>Some (General Motors) involve slowly pouring 2/3 of the can directly into the intake with the engine running between 1500 - 1800 rpm, and (almost) dumping the last 1/3 of the can in to choke the engine off, letting it sit for 15 minutes before cranking the engine up again.</p>

<p>Another (BG products) had a fancy little nozzle that you clamp to the throttle body and spray into the intake with the engine running, or hook up to the fuel rail and run through the injectors.</p>

<p>Others involve an aerosol can that you spray in the intake while the engine is running and add an additive to the tank.</p>

<p>But the cheapest, and just as effective except in the most severe cases is plan old water. Slowly (<strong><em>note too fast and you can destroy your engine as in bend a rod</em></strong>) pouring about a quart of water into the intake with the engine running about 1500 RPMs </p>

<p>I have actually checked the effectiveness (non-scientifically) by looking into the cylinder with a boroscope through the spark-plug hole. Water seemed to work just as well as the additives. On a side note the BG man didn't like me so much after that, and in his defense it's a lot harder to sell the customer a water induction cleaning verses some great chemical that would solve all their problems.</p>

<p>The bottom line to all of this is if you aren't have drivability issues, it's a waste of time and money, unless of course you do the water treatment yourself.</p>

<p>I have taken hundreds if not thousands of motors apart and rarely see any carbon buildup to amount to anything.</p>

<p>I have heard 60,000 miles from some sources, but the manual seems to suggest around 90,000 <em>depending on driving conditions</em>.</p>
","<p>What are your <em>driving conditions</em>? If you primarily do city driving (stop and go, dusty) or live in a particularly hot or cold environment, then it's worth looking at the ""severe service"" area of your manual, and go by that recommendation.</p>

<p>Usually, it's relatively easy to inspect the timing belt by taking off the top part of the timing belt cover. You are looking for signs of obvious distress, cracking, discoloration, etc. </p>

<p>Another consideration is whether or not the engine is an interference engine. If it is, a timing belt breaking means Very Bad Things. If it is not, it just means you will break down and need a tow. </p>

<p>Edit - After more research, the evidence suggests that the Accord V6 IS an interference engine. Hopefully someone who has access to the Honda technical reference manuals can confirm this. I removed the link I had earlier, because looks out of date (nothing newer than ~1995). Finding reliable database of interference engines on the Internet is surprisingly hard.</p>

","<p>First thing is to initially determine if you're burning it or leaking it.  Assuming your car isn't spewing a plume of white smoke when you're driving - you will have to do some additional diagnosis to determine the method of consumption.</p>

<p>First check the oil and coolant - if either contain a milky substance you have a cracked something or a blown HG. Possibly a failed oil cooler (if it's of the water cooled variety). Only a leakdown test can determine anything further beyond a teardown. I have heard of some cars having poor intake manifold sealing which can cause coolant to be sucked into the intake tract and burned without the telltale white smoke.</p>

<p>If the fluids look okay, have the system pressure tested. Basically it's like hooking up a bicycle pump to your radiator to pressurize the system while cold.  If the leak isn't obvious you can use a UV dye to pinpoint weepage or very minute leaks.</p>

"What happens if petrol is used in a diesel engine?","20836","","<p>The question is asked for various proportions :
- 10% of petrol 
- 50% of petrol 
- 100% of petrol 
in a diesel engine.</p>

<p>If you mention a possible damage, please specify the technical reasons with it.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> : didn't know the <strong>petrol</strong> equivalent in English. Thanks for the suggestions to edit.</p>
","<p>The key differences between petrol and diesel engines is the method of combustion.</p>

<p>Petrol ignites with sparks or with compression. Diesel doesn't ignite so well, but burns much better through compression.</p>

<p>Petrol engines inject the air/fuel mixture and then use spark plugs to ignite the mixture just after a piston reaches top dead centre. </p>

<p>Diesel engines compress air, and then add air/fuel mixture. As a result they run hotter. The compression and heat give combustion, rather than flash ignition.</p>

<p>The differences between the fuels are measured on the octane or cetane rating.
Fuels with a high octane have a low cetane and are easy to ignite, so work well in petrol engines.
Fuels with low octane and high cetane ignite by combustion so work well in diesel engines.</p>

<p>I've heard that a very small amount of petrol (0.5L in a full tank) can actually improve the efficiency of a car, but this must be treated as a rumour. Engine damage could still occur.</p>

<p>10% petrol will result in ""knocking"" or ""pinking"", where the engine runs very rough. This is because the petrol will ignite prematurely in the diesel engine, and there will be a loss of power as the combustion happens over a longer time than with 100% diesel. Some damage may also occur to the fuel supply system as petrol is less lubricative than diesel, and strips out some of the lubrication needed for diesel pumps to work well.
Example: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvjrT5mRj_U"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvjrT5mRj_U</a></p>

<p>50% petrol will result in engine damage, as the incorrect timing of combustions will put high stresses on engine components. Something like this would happen: </p>

"What is this squeak in my Dodge Ram 1500, and how can I fix it?","20792","","<h3>Vehicle:</h3>

<p>1999 Dodge Ram 1500 Laramie SLT, with extended cab. 212k miles on the engine, all original under the hood except for a steering box and steering pump (put in in the fall of 2014). The engine is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysler_LA_engine%235.9L_Magnum_V8"" rel=""nofollow"">5.9 liter magnum v8</a> (360). </p>

<h3>Problem:</h3>

<p>A loud squeak, which I believe is coming from one of the pulley wheels. The noise begins about 10-15 minutes after starting the engine (ie, after it warms up). The squeak correlates with the engine rpms, and goes away after about 3k rpms. Also, the squeak leaves after driving through water (for a few seconds), so it's in a place where the wheels can kick water. The pitch of the squeak changes if I spin the wheel all the way over in either direction.</p>

<h3>Questions:</h3>

<ul>
<li>How can I pinpoint the cause of this squeak?</li>
<li>How can I stop the squeak (if this is something I should try myself)?</li>
</ul>
","<p>It is probably going to be one of your pulley wheels, but I doubt it's the pump. If it's brand new, they usually don't make any noise at all. It is either going to be one of either the idler or tensioner pulleys. And if you don't know which one is which, if you eliminate all of the other pulleys which have <em>things</em> attached to them, you should have one tensioner pulley (is a small spring loaded arm with a pulley). It may or may not have an idler pulley. If it does, it will be the other pulley not connected to anything (like the water pump or alternator, etc), but is not spring loaded (thus the name ""idler"" because it doesn't do anything but take up slack in the belt). If you still cannot figure it out, here are some pictures -</p>

<p>Tensioner pulley:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bbzWq.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Idler pulley:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9SRwa.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>When looking at the two, don't be surprised if they both look the same (the pulleys themselves). More than likely they will actually be the same, the difference being one of them has a swing arm which is under tension, the other will just be attached to a bracket on the engine. </p>

<p>Like I was saying, one of the two is probably going to be bad and this is pretty normal for these pulleys. If you have 212k on the engine and have never changed either one of these, you are in pretty good shape. It should be pretty easy to tell which one is making the noise by taking the belt off then spinning the pulleys by hand ... just wing it around fast and you'll probably hear it.</p>

<p>To take the belt off, you'll need to take up tension on the tensioner pulley. This will allow the belt to loosen and you can pull it off. If you forget the order of how the belt goes around the pulleys, there should be a diagram inside the engine compartment (usually up by the radiator).</p>

<p>If you don't hear anything by the spinning/listening method, you could also possibly feel it as you turn it. It might have a bit of a scratchy feel as you turn it. You also may feel a bit of play in the wheel ... some of them have a <em>lot</em> of play, depending on how worn out they are. </p>

<p>If that doesn't get you which one it is, find yourself a mechanics stethoscope. You can pick one up at Harbor Freight for real cheap.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3AS2l.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>If you don't want to do that, find a very long screwdriver and place the tip of it on the pulley bolt (center of the pulley) and the handle end on your ear (while the vehicle is running with the belt in place) ... yes, if you are not careful with this method, it can be dangerous. Just remember not to have anything hanging like shirt sleeves or a tie. I usually take off rings and watch before working on vehicles ... just think safety. It should be readily apparent when you find which pulley it is, because it will be uber loud in your ear (you can also place it up to your jaw bone someplace close to your ear and you will hear it ... main point is contact with your head so the noise will transfer into your ear). </p>

<p><strong>To stop the squeak temporarily</strong>, you can spray some lubricant into the bearings of the pulley. If you choose to do this, try to get as little as possible onto the belts. The best way is to ensure you utilize the little red straw which comes with the spray. I'd suggest to use WD-40, but it won't last very long (probably only a couple of hours of run time, if that). I'd use something a little heavier if available, like possibly some engine oil from a squirt can ... just don't use a lot because it will get everywhere otherwise. </p>

<p><strong>To permanently stop the squeak</strong>, you'll need to replace the offending pulley. This is pretty easily accomplished by:</p>

<p>Idler Pulley</p>

<ol>
<li>Remove the serpentine belt</li>
<li>Unscrew the bolt fastener in the center of the pulley (I think it's a 15mm bolt head)</li>
<li>Place the bolt/washer into the new idler pulley.</li>
<li>Affix the new pulley to the engine mounting bracket. (Note: Make it tight, but don't over tighten ... hard to say how tight ""<em>tight</em>"" is, though.)</li>
<li>Replace serpentine belt</li>
</ol>

<p>Tensioner Pulley</p>

<ol>
<li>Remove the serpentine belt</li>
<li>Unscrew the nut fastener from the back/center of the tensioner arm (should go through the bracket and hold the tensioner in place).</li>
<li>Pull the old tensioner from its position and replace with new tensioner.</li>
</ol>

<p>NOTE: There should be a small dowel sticking out near the stud on the back of the tensioner. This is there to locate the tensioner in the correct position and allows the spring to build tension. Ensure this goes back into the hole in the correct position on the bracket. (You can see it in the second and third <a href=""http://www.1aauto.com/serpentine-belt-tensioner-with-pulley/i/1aebt00006?f=380239&amp;y=1998&amp;utm_campaign=gb_csv_br&amp;utm_content=EBT&amp;gclid=Cj0KEQiA3bymBRC19IrD7O_NrYsBEiQAb2dpAxW7EBU2LjSJ80nHKas4PHv974wlT_5eRfR8hmIRMaUaAgkq8P8HAQ"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">picture on this site</a>.)</p>

<p>The question I have is - which takes precedence? Should I be re-gapping these plugs to 0.54 because that is what is recommended in the shop manual, or should I be making sure the gap is 0.44 because that's what is recommended for these particular plugs?</p>
","<p>You can find the spark plug gap specifications on a sticker that will be either on the radiator support or on the underside of the hood (there are other locations such as the strut towers, etc). This is the gap that should be used when using the OEM spark plugs and even when using an off-branded plug that is a valid replacement for the OEM brand. Here are a few examples of what the sticker will look like.</p>

<p>It may be the pulley itself seizing which you may be able to recover with some corrosion cleaner, lubricant etc.  Otherwise it may be internal of the compressor.</p>

<p>Also, there is supposed to be a certain amount of oil in the refrigerant to lubricate the system, perhaps you have a leak that has caused loss of this lubricant and again the compressor is taking more effort to rotate.</p>

"Engine's Normal Operating Temperature","20658","","<p>I read in the <a href=""http://www.bobistheoilguy.com/motor-oil-101/"" rel=""nofollow"">Motor Oil University article</a> on Bob the Oil Guy's websites that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The automotive designers usually call for their engines to run at 212°F ( 100°C ) oil and water temperature with an oil thickness of 10. ... <em>The engine is designed to run at 212°F at all external temperatures from Alaska to Florida.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I installed a 82.5°C thermostat on my <a href=""http://en.mazda-club.eu/sub-model/mazda-323-familia-protege-iv-ba-bh-1"" rel=""nofollow"">97 Mazda 323 BA 1.8L BP DOHC</a>.  The radiator was replaced by the previous owner and is not OEM.  I'm using a premixed glycol-ethylene coolant rated between -10°C to 118°C which specifically says on the bottle not to add water.  The service manual calls for 65% water to 35% coolant in environments over -15°C.</p>

<p><strong>After all those details, here's my question:</strong></p>

<p>When I hook up to the ECU, I find that most of the time the engine temperature stays between 85°C to 92°C.  Rarely, when standing in traffic for a long time, the temp will get up to 97°C, at which point the ECU turns on the fan and the temp rapidly returns to the previously mentioned range.</p>

<p>Is this normal?  If not, any idea's?  </p>

<p>So far I haven't found anything regarding normal operating temps in the service manual, although that doesn't mean it's not there of course.</p>
","<p>Yes, it's normal. Maybe just a tiny bit on the cool side. But if you're in traffic a lot that cooler thermostat is a good thing. All the cars I've owned would run between 85 and 95 degrees Celsius. 85 at highway speeds, then creeping up to 95 or 96 when in slow traffic, at which point the fans kick in.</p>

<p>Pro tip: the hotter an engine runs, the more efficiently it burns evil hydrocarbons.</p>

<p>If your car is running too cold for your liking (or according to the opinion of a good mechanic), there are basically three things you could do:</p>

<ol>
<li>install a hotter thermostat</li>
<li>drain your oil and fill up with a more appropriate option (ask your mechanic)</li>
<li>take the car to a tuner to have them lean out the air/fuel ratio slightly and play with the timing. </li>
</ol>

<p>The third option will increase the temperatures inside the combustion chamber and exhaust and also provide slightly better fuel economy/performance. Of the three though, #1 and #2 are your best options.</p>

"Effects of leaky exhaust valves","20625","","<p>While rebuilding my valves, I noticed that 4 out of 6 exhaust valves on one side of the V6 engine were leaking after lapping and I had to relap them. I determined that by doing a <a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/18862/reliability-of-water-test-for-valve-seal"">water test</a>. I am guessing they were leaking even before (IOW that the leaking wasn't a result of a poor lapping job) which sounds tenable because the exhaust ports looked like a mess before I cleaned them.  The fact that none of the intake valves leaked led me to a conclusion that exhaust valves take more heat so they are more likely to need readjustment.</p>

<p>But what are some effects of leaky exhaust valves?  E.g. I underwent the complete head gasket and valve rebuild procedure because my engine was overheating and the head gaskets got fried.  My speculation was that was because of a stuck thermostat that caused overheating.  But could it have been due to leaky exhaust valves?</p>
","<p>Under normal use (non-performance type use), the valves, both intake and exhaust, should last the life of the engine. If and when they do leak, it will not take long for the valve to become a burnt valve. In your case, <em>I doubt they were leaking</em> prior to pulling everything apart. If the exhaust valves had leaked, they would have been fried. If valves do not seat correctly, they will not transmit heat through the head as they are supposed to and will become very hot, thus causing the ""burnt valve"" syndrome. It wouldn't take the engine 5-years for this to occur, but rather months if not weeks for it to actually start causing you issues (if not less time). </p>

<p>Even if the exhaust valves were leaking, this would not have caused the overheating issue you were experiencing. Valves transmit heat into the heads through proper seating. If they aren't seating correctly, you'd have experienced less heat traveling into the heads through valve transfer. As well, you'd been seeing lower compression in the affected cylinders due to bleed off during the compression stroke (slight bleed off until a valve gets very burned, but bleed off none the less). Due to this loss of dynamic compression, you'd have not been seeing as good of power coming from that cylinder, as well as a reduction in heat. This reduction would not have been great, but it would still be less than optimal.</p>

<p>During normal use, valves spin as they are used (not spin as in a top would spin, but they do rotate). This actions provides that they do not sit still, helps clean off of the seats and faces, which helps it to continue to seat throughout its lifespan.</p>

<p>I don't think your exhaust valves leaked due to a poor lap job, but probably an <em>incomplete</em> lap job after you mixed your valves up. I'm sure if they were put into the same holes they came out of, your valves would have had no issues what-so-ever. When you clean up your valves during the rebuild process, even though you may keep the valves in the same positions, lapping is not a bad idea to promote better sealing.</p>

"2008 Ford Mondeo 2.0 TDCI cranks but won´t start","20554","","<p>Ok, so I´m having this problem with a 2008 Ford Mondeo mk4 with a 2.0 TDci engine code AZBA, same one Peugeot uses in other cars such as the 407.
Car was having trouble a few days back to start whenever it reached normal operating temperature and it was stopped. It took like 10 seconds cranking to get it started. So I started plugging in my OBD scanner which throw me a p0087 error, low pressure on rail. It wasn't present, so I deleted it and performed an adaptation reseting all systems. Furthermore, I found out that three of the injectors were leaking like crazy, so I proceed to check it closely enough to find out they were losen, so I tighten them a little bit more.
The issue kind of disappeared for a few days, but now I´m having the same problem again, only I have not leakage and fault p0087 is now present, oh, and it doesn't start at all, doesn't matter if it´s cold or hot. 
So I decided to test bypassing the whole low pressure system and putting it some diesel directly into the common rail high pressure pump, and yes, it started right away.
Now I´m thinking but I´m not sure and that´s where I need help, that probably some kind of lift pump is broken, and if so where is it located, cause I haven't been able to find it close to the tank. Could it be that this lift pump is integrated with the high pressure pump? </p>
","<p>I just find out today after bleeding all the left air in the low-high pressure sides, that it wasn´t the lift pump that was faulty, but just a rubber seal located on the entrance to the high pressure pump. It took me quite a long time to find out but after discarding there wasn´t any kind of lift pump located on the fuel tank (Mondeo MK3 does have one there), and that it was indeed integrated among the common rail pump like other PSA engines usually do.
I replaced this rubber seal and now car works like a charm with 270000 Km. If this same failure still persists in the future, I´ll just install a non-return valve close to the high pressure pump, and a small gasoline pump that helps send the fuel along the fuel lines because <strong>it does make the difference</strong> on this particular case.

"Why does diesel engine have redline much lower than petrol engine redline?","20553","","<p>Why do diesel automotive engines redline at around 4500 rpm whereas petrol ones go to 6500-8000 rpm?</p>

<p>Does this have something to do with the compression ratio?</p>
","<p>In Short its based on low burn rate of diesel plus the longer stroke of the diesel engine.</p>

<p>First you must understand the difference between these engines, the diesel works on purely compression of fuel , heating and generating bang to produce power, the gasoline on the other hand is natively twitchy and needs a spark to explode and produce power on its own.</p>

<p>That said,</p>

<p>Think of the petrol engine as a cheetah, it has lightweight bones and has a streamlined body thus is very fast but is not powerful enough to kill a lion or a rhino. </p>

<p>The Diesel engine is like an elephant, its slow and has a lot of strength, but needs heavier legs to support the huge body mass thus it cant run as fast as the cheetah but has a lot of strength. By strength of the elephant I mean torque in the engine.</p>

<p>The petrol engine natively combusts so it does not need heavy duty parts to withstand the explosion, yes you are compressing the fuel but its not nearly as much as the diesel, that is why 100cc motorcycles rev like crazy they have lightweight construction (cranks, pistons).</p>

<p>The diesel does not combust as much as petrol, it needs to be compressed to a much higher extent to combust thus the cylinder head, the piston, the crank everything needs to be heavy duty to withstand the compression explosion thus slowing down the speed of the piston.</p>

<p>Finally to answer your question:</p>

<p>Diesel burns slowly compared to petrol and for most diesel engines the limit is around 4800 to 5000 RPM.</p>

<p>Adding clarity to the above point, in a petrol engine almost 95% of the fuel is burnt in every stroke but in the diesel engine not all of the diesel is burnt in each stroke due to the slow combustion rate some diesel remains in the cylinder before the next stroke so no matter how hard you push, that small quantity of diesel will not burn before the piston is ready for the next stroke thus limiting the speed or redline.</p>

"How to fix P1167 in a 2001 Honda Accord, with a F23A4 engine","20384","","<p>I used to have both P1166 and P1167 error codes on my 2001 Honda Accord (F23A4 engine).</p>

<p>I fixed the P1166 by replacing the O2 sensor.</p>

<p>For about a day, everything looked wonderful (i.e. no <code>check engine</code> light on). 
Then, (after a day), the dreaded <code>check engine</code> light turned on again.</p>

<p>I used my OBDII device to check the code. It's <strong>P1167</strong> now.</p>

<p>Googling this code raised the possibility of fuse #6 (15A) blown. I checked that fuse. It's 100% perfect.</p>

<p>What else could be the cause for this P1167 code?</p>
","<p>The Air/Fuel Ratio (A/F) sensor 1 is installed in the exhaust system and detects oxygen content in the exhaust gas. The A/F sensor transmits output voltage to the Engine Control Module (ECM). <em>A heater for the sensor element is embedded in the A/F sensor (sensor 1). If the A/F sensor (sensor 1) voltage is low, the air/fuel ratio is lean, and the ECM uses A/F feedback control to issue a Rich command. If the A/F sensor (sensor 1) voltage is high, the air/fuel ratio is rich, and the ECM uses A/F feedback control to issue a Lean command.</em> The heater element is fused by fuse F6 as you say, but this fuse operates a relay. The relay may not be working. I dont have a diagram for this relay location, but it may be in your vehicles handbook. The check light went out possibly because you cancelled the code with your tester/scanner. Once the ECU ran its test on the A/F sensor the ECU found it faulty and turned it back on. Definitely the fault is on the heater side of the A/F sensor.</p>

"Best Ways to Pass Emissions?","20276","","<p>I recently bought a 1989 Mercedes 300E that didn't run.  Has a straight-six gas engine.  Thanks to the miracle of Seafoam and a lot of luck, I was able to get fuel delivery happening again.  I then switched out some incorrectly-gapped plugs and pretty much every other fluid.  Fired her up, coaxed her through the first 35 seconds and VRROOOM!</p>

<p>Now I have to get this car emissions-tested.  I'm going to burn through the old gas in the tank and refill with premium Chevron (which I hear is among the best).  I may try the top-down valve cleaning thing or whatever it's called with Seafoam (hopefully managing not to hydro-lock my engine in the process).</p>

<p><strong>Does anyone have any other emissions-test-passing tricks?</strong></p>
","<p>For a pre OBD-II vehicle such as this one, the best thing to do is get it running as smoothly as possible, using normal maintenance and repair procedures. This means no misfiring, smooth idle, smooth acceleration, not overheating, etc. The same stuff you'd expect to work well in every day driving. There should also be no check engine light. This vehicle will have some sort of basic self-checking, it just won't follow OBD-II standards.</p>

<p>If all of this is working well, then there is a very good chance you'll pass emissions. However, there are some conditions that won't show up in daily driving that could still fail you, and those have to be diagnosed on an ad hoc basis, after the test. </p>

<p>Mosts emissions tests will check NOx, CO and HC. A very basic rundown:</p>

<ul>
<li>NOx - Oxides of nitrogen. This means the engine is running too hot (2500F +). This can be caused by poor cooling or fuel mixture is too lean. Modern vehicles also have an EGR system, which exists exclusively to reduce NOx. If the engine is running in the correct tempuratures, and NOx is high and everything else is normal, the EGR system is strongly suspect.</li>
<li>CO - Carbon monoxide. CO exists when there is an incomplete combustion of the air/fuel mixture. This can be caused by restricted airflow (dirty air filter), or a sensor that is reporting the incorrect airflow (MAF/MAP, TPS), or a faulty O2 sensor.</li>
<li>HC - Hydrocarbons. This is raw fuel, meaning the fuel didn't burn completely during combustion. This can be an ignition problem such as misfiring, or poor timing. Usually this will show up as a driveability problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a lot more to diagnosting emissions, as there are a lot of complex systems all working together, and all of the readings have to be considered together, not in isolation. For example, if all three readings are high, and the engine checks out and all underhood systems check out, the catalytic converters may be faulty. </p>

"Engine Bogs down with A/C on highway","20266","","<p>This started to happen relatively recent.  It's 2003 Chevy Trailblazer.  What is happening when the engine is idling and I turn the A/C on or the defroster (which also uses the A/C I believe), the engine starts to bog down.</p>

<p>What could be causing this extra load on the engine?  What could it be in the compressor that is so much resistance?  Could it be that I just need to recharge my A/C?</p>
","<p>The compressor is a considerable load on your engine. In order to stop the engine from bogging the A/C usually has a way of raising the idle by letting more air past the throttle body. This function is where I think your problem lies.</p>

<p>This can be a separate solenoid specific to the A/C system with a (fairly hefty) vacuum line to both before and after the throttle body. I've seen this solenoid referred to as an A/C Idle Up Vacuum Switching Valve (VSV) in some manuals, but Chevy's terminology may be different. If it is a separate solenoid, there will also be a separate idle-up solenoid for the power steering as well as for large electrical loads (headlamps, large electric fans, rear defroster). You should find this solenoid, verify that it's not working and replace it.</p>

<p>The alternative, I guess, is that there is one ECU controlled valve that performs the idle-up function for all the systems that require it. In that case, unless your engine also bogs at other times, I would suspect the electrical pathway that informs the ECU of the compressor operating.</p>

<p>Please update your question as you find out more, and I'll add to this answer. </p>

The lifter in this case is a two piece design with a spring in between. When the lifter sits for too long a period without being run, the oil will drain out of it. This allows the lifter to completely collapse until the lifter can be filled again. During collapse, both sides (top and bottom) impact each other and thus creates the noise you are talking about.

<p>They told me that I needed to replace the passlock sensor which would cost about $500. I was not ready to get this type of work done at the time, so I recently went back and they recommended that I let them perform a second diagnosis. </p>

<p>This time they returned with two issues. The passlock sensor and body control module needed to be replaced, this would be $1000. Upon asking the service rep, would the passlock sensor replacement solve the ""sporadic start issue"", she said no. She stated that both parts would prevent the car from starting because they dealt with communication. </p>

<p>Does this sound true? How does a BCM keep a car from not starting? </p>

<p>Additional Note:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have not been using my keypad, the battery holder needs repair </li>
</ul>
","<p>In a short answer: Yes, the BCM can prevent a car from starting, and doubly so when you introduce a security/antitheft system like Passlock.</p>

<p>The reason is that the BCM feeds inputs into the Passlock (or other security system) for it to 'determine' if it is being stolen or hotwired. For example: the status of the doors, interior lights, trunk status, etc. and in some cases can even control the fuel pump.</p>

<p>That being said, I would not go hand $1k to the dealership. I would follow this guide and bypass the Passlock system entirely: <a href=""http://www.bergerweb.net/PasslockFix/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bergerweb.net/PasslockFix/</a></p>

<p>Also note that the guide supports my answer and the GM dealers' association with the BCM in that if you attempt the Passlock bypass and it doesn't work, then you need to replace your BCM.</p>

"Oil change with front wheels on ramps?","19589","","<p>From the obsessive compulsive department:</p>

<p>I've been changing my own oil by driving up on a pair of ramps, draining and filling.  Based on a slight overfill condition after adding the specified amount of oil and returning the vehicle to level, I know I'm not getting all the old oil out.  This makes sense, since the drain plug is towards the front of the oil pan.  Oil must be pooling at the back of the pan due to the angle from the ramps.  It can't be more than a couple or three ounces.</p>

<p>I'm not worried about the slight excess.  Shaving a couple ounces off the amount added next time will put it spot on.  I don't like the idea of leaving a measurable amount of dirty oil if I can avoid it, especially on the one vehicle that only gets out of the garage a few months a year.  </p>

<p>I suppose I can try and get another pair of ramps under the rear wheels if they'll fit.  Jacking up the rear to level the vehicle would work, too, I guess.  Any other ideas?  Am am I the only nut that worries about a couple ounces of dirty oil? </p>
","<p>For OCD you can place a flat pan below the oil drain and lower the front wheels to get the remaining oil out, then jack it up again.</p>

<p>Though I would not worry about couple of ounces in your place. Even if your car is level old oil will still remain in the engine (other cavities, thin film, etc.).</p>

<p>For example in my engine that takes 4L of fresh oil, 2 ounces is less than 1.5% of it.</p>

<p>In case you need to flush the old oil completely (e.g. after filling with wrong type of oil) you could use a oil flush mixture (drain old, refill with flusher, idle 5-10 min, drain, fill new oil).</p>

"Should overflow tank be filled when replacing coolant?","19485","","<p>I have recently fully rebuilt my engine, minus the block and pistons.  All the gaskets were replaced, valves lapped, valve lashes tuned etc.  I did it because I had an overheating problem and a head gasket failure. I performed straightedge and feeler gauge tests to make sure the previous overheating and head gasket failure did not cause cylinder head warpage.</p>

<p>When I put the coolant back, I used one of these no-spill funnels to make sure the system is fully burped by running the engine with the funnel on, which would compensate with coolant any bubbles that get burped out.  I really believe I squeezed every single little bubble out, also because I turned the heat on to make sure the heater core gets its flow.  <em>I also filled the overflow tank up to about half where the FULL notch is.</em></p>

<p>What I noticed when I first drove it more than a few miles is that there was a splatter of coolant around the overflow tank, when I lifted the hood.  I though the whole rebuild was in vain and overheating was back even though the truck did not overheat at the time (but I though the splatter was an indication it was going to). However, then I drove it another 3 hours in both the city and highway and there was no more splatter or overheating. In fact, the cooling worked so well that even after 3 hours the rad cap was not too hot to be taken off and the coolant level was proper.</p>

<p>The question of why there was initial splatter still remained.  Here is how I attempted to rationalize it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Under normal <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_expansion"">thermal expansion</a>, the coolant, which was cold when filled 100% into the tank, spilled over into the overflow tank.  But the overflow tank also had coolant in it, which I put in when I refilled the system, so there wasn't enough room left to absorb the expanded part and it splattered out the excess via the excess valve.  Once the amount of coolant in both the system proper and the overflow self-regulated by splattering the excess, there was no more splattering as there was now room to absorb thermal expansion overflow in the tank.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>QUESTIONS:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is the above a tenable explanation?  </p></li>
<li><p>Should you put no coolant in the overflow tank when refilling the system with cold coolant to leave enough room for thermal expansion ?</p></li>
<li><p>In general, under healthy engine circumstances, how much coolant should be getting exchanged between the cooling system proper and the overflow tank?  Is it to be expected that the overflow tank fills with thermal expansion overflow when the engine is hot (not overheated) and then that gets sucked dry (or evaporated) back into the radiator when the engine cools down?</p></li>
<li><p>I am also an avid plumbing DIY-er.  In case that you are too or at least familiar enough, does the coolant overflow tank in a vehicle perform the same function an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_tank"">expansion tank</a> does for water heating systems, which is to absorb the liquid volume that expands under heated conditions?  Since you don't put water in an expansion tank when installing it, by the same token should you not put coolant in your overflow tank?</p></li>
</ol>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Is the above a tenable explanation?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. While some thermal expansion happens in a cooling system, the amount which happens can be absorbed by the rubber hoses present in the system, unless the system overheats. When overheating occurs, steam is created, which causes pressure spikes, which causes more over heating, which causes more steam, etc. When a cooling system is behaving properly, it works together in harmony. The temperature is kept below the boiling point, while the pressured cap allows the boiling point to be raised. As the coolant flows through the radiator, excess heat is bled off which allows the boiling point to not be reached. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should you put no coolant in the overflow tank when refilling the system with cold coolant to leave enough room for thermal expansion ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should fill the radiator up all of the way and fill the expansion (overflow) tank to the cold mark when first filling your system.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No, you should not expect thermal expansion. If the system is properly bled, you should have very little air in the system. This little bit of air may pass out to the expansion tank when the system is fully up to temperature, but this isn't a given. When the system cools down you'll see the system draw coolant back into itself from the over flow if it needs to. After it cycles the first couple of times, you may need to fill your overflow up a little to make up the difference. If there is a large amount of difference, you probably didn't bleed your system correctly.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Completely different function. From my understanding of an expansion tank in a heating system or even in the hot water system of a house, it is primarily there to absorb sharp spikes in pressure which causes noise throughout the system. The overflow tank in the cooling system is to catch excess and provide for as I've described above. Fill the tank to the cold line and you should be golden. Recheck several times after first start to ensure there is enough to cover any contingencies.</p>

"Why don't we rotate tyres but you rotate tires?","19415","","<p>Is planning a regular rotation of new tyres over their lifespan a good or bad plan?</p>

<p>From many posts I've seen here and elsewhere on the web, motorists in the USA seem to see rotating tires as a task which ought to be undertaken at regular intervals.  By rotating tires, I mean moving their position on the vehicle, so moving them from the front to rear axle for example.</p>

<p>In the UK, we seldom do this.  Indeed one of the biggest tyre fitters in the country actually advises against the practice (see link <a href=""https://www.kwik-fit.com/tyres/information/tyre-rotation"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>)</p>

<p>I've just fitted a set of four tyres to our 2012 VW Golf and wondered if it is worth rotating them over the life of the tyres.  Is there any advice that is clearly for or against the practice and are there any studies which back this up?</p>
","<p>tl dr: Kwik Fit is full of crap. It's good to rotate tyres (and tires, too :o). </p>

<p>The entire idea of rotating tires is to keep the wear relatively similar (or even), front to rear. If rotation is done at the specified intervals, the only time you'll have a <em>weaker tire</em> of appreciable wear is when it's time to replace all four.</p>

<p>I don't know what the end goal of <a href=""https://www.kwik-fit.com/home"" rel=""noreferrer"">Kwik Fit</a> is, but there are several things they state on their website which are VERY disturbing to me having to do with tire (tyre) rotation. Here is what I'm talking about.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I'm taking quotes from the page you linked.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Partly worn tyres are more likely to experience punctures – particularly in wet weather conditions.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>What does wet weather have to do with whether a tire is punctured or not? Absolutely nothing, as far as I can tell. Road hazards will flatten a tire just as quickly in dry weather as it will in wet. </p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Front tyre deflation will create an under-steer effect which is easier to control than over-steer (the effect produced by a rear tyre deflation)</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Understeer by definition is: ""(with automobiles) having a tendency to turn less sharply than is intended"". Does anyone believe if you have a sudden tire deflation on the front end you are going to be able to turn the vehicle more sharply than if you lose it on the back end? I certainly don't. </p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>In the unlikely event that a tyre deflates suddenly, then it is easier to control the vehicle if this occurs at the front of the vehicle. For improved handling and stability it is now recommended that the ‘best’ tyres should always be fitted at the rear of the vehicle. This is irrespective of whether the car is front or rear wheel drive.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>~70% of the braking power and most all of the steering power is controlled from the front end of the vehicle. If you suddenly lose air pressure in a front tire, you've now lost a major portion of both, which means you've lost a major amount of control of the vehicle. This is <em>especially true</em> if you are traveling down the motorway at 70mph (which I believe is the typical posted speed on the M1, right?). By having a blowout on the rear of the vehicle, you maintain almost all of your braking power and lose very little of your turning power (rear might want to drift some). If you lose a front tire, it will drag the car in the direction of the lost tire. If the pull is great enough, it can most likely cause an accident, either through dragging the car into other traffic or causing the driver to lose control and creating a single car accident.</p>

<p>It seems to me this tyre company has an agenda. One in which they want their patrons to wear out their tires faster, so they'll come back and buy more tires. Having the weaker tire on the rear of the vehicle is not going to create as big of an issue as having it on the front. </p>

<p>Other things they state there on the website are accurate. You don't rotate tires on a vehicle where the front and rear are different sizes (like you'd see on some sport vehicles). I have never seen a car which has a specification for asymmetric tread pattern at one end of the vehicle and symmetrical at the other, but I guess there could be. In this case, you don't want to rotate the tires, either.</p>

"Why do the lights flicker when I accelerate?","19201","","<p>I have a 2003 Ford Focus.  Recently, I've noticed that when I accelerate (step on the gas), all the lights on the car flicker.  This happens to both the dash lights in the car and the headlights outside.  They will pulse bright and dim while I'm accelerating, and when I let up on the gas, the lights return to normal.</p>

<p>What might cause this problem?</p>
","<p>There are three phases of a charging system.  The charging system frequently will create AC current and diodes within the alternator will act as a rectifier and convert the AC current to DC where it can be stored in a battery.</p>

<h1>Here is a diagram</h1>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/90FQw.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>If one or more of the diodes fails in the alternator you begin to see the pulse of the charging in your lights.  It's especially apparent when two legs of the three legged system are down.</p>

<h1>This is what the waveform looks like</h1>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hMwPN.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The top wave is AC the lower wave is DC.<br>
If you you take wave 2 and 3 out and only have the signal from number 1 then you can begin to see why you have the pulsing affect.  </p>

<p>The reason it does it when you get on the gas is that your rpm's increase and the transmission and the engine engage, when you get off the gas most automatic transmission cars drop their rpm's and disengage from the transmission.  Hence the pulsing while on the gas.  Hope this helps, good luck.</p>

"Scooter won't start","19185","","<p>My friend has a Chinese 50cc scooter ""VIP Future Champion"" that won't start. He let the battery run down when it was still operable, over a year ago, and when he finally replaced the battery, it wouldn't start with the electric starter or the kick start. There are at least several things wrong with it, probably all stemming from storing it outside unused for a long period.</p>

<p>There's no continuity through the electric starter button when it's pressed. Shorting across the terminals that go to the button does not make the starter operate either. However, I'm guessing this is just a matter of chewed or rusted wires, since running a wire from the positive battery terminal straight to the starter motor does make it turn over, but it still doesn't ignite and run.</p>

<p>There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with the ignition system. I was able to produce a spark from the end of the spark plug wire to the chassis, and the ground seems good everywhere.</p>

"AC blower won't turn on after replacing battery","19138","","<p>I have a U.S. 2011 Volkswagen GTI. After the car wouldn't start (starter would crank but engine would not turn on) I decided it's probably time to replace the battery, and did.</p>

<p>Car starts fine, but now the AC blower won't turn on at any setting. All the normal AC lights come on on the dash, and I can hear the engine revs changing when the compressor kicks in, but no air comes from the vents at any of the 4 fan settings.</p>

<p>Here's what I've done so far</p>

<ul>
<li>Checked every single fuse (under the hood and under the dash) both visually and with a non-powered fuse checker.</li>
<li>Disconnected the battery for about an hour and reconnected it (I read something online about allowing the system to reset, probably hogwash)</li>
<li>Visually inspected the blower's resistor pack which is located under the passenger glove box. It appears OK but I'm not sure how to actually test it with my multimeter, or if I should even try at this point.</li>
</ul>

<p>A couple other details:</p>

<ul>
<li>When I connected the new battery, the negative terminal arced upon connection. Could this indicate a bad ground somewhere else in the wiring?</li>
<li>I have a custom stereo system with a 600W amp connected to the battery which has worked fine for a few years now.</li>
<li>When I went for a drive earlier today, the windows would roll down but the automatic rolldown function (when pressing fully on the button) wouldn't work. When I started the car again later it worked again.</li>
</ul>

<p>The above makes me suspect a bad ground, but I'm just now learning how to diagnose electrical problems! I'm a complete novice at maintaining my own vehicle but am eager to learn, especially since I'm now out of warranty :)</p>

<p>What steps would you take to diagnose this problem?</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
","<p>The problem is resolved. I ended up taking it to the dealership, where apparently the fix was to ""redo all of the fuses in the engine compartment"". I doubt the problem was that I had a fuse in the wrong spot, seeing as I didn't touch the fuses when I changed the battery, and I know for a fact the blower worked the day before changing the battery.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it will pretty much remain a mystery, but assuming the dealership was telling the truth, it was as simple as a bad fuse - despite them all testing fine with a fuse checker and not appearing burnt or broken. Looking back, I wish I would have taken out every single fuse and tested each for continuity and low resistance with my multimeter. I also really wish VW and other German car makers would include fuse diagrams in the owner's manual.</p>

<p>The other possibility is that it wasn't a fuse at all - perhaps the tech unknowingly corrected the problem with a computer reset. There are a lot of variables in diagnosing electrical problems as I've come to understand - maybe <em>the tech</em> mispositioned a fuse before he started doing things with the diagnostic port.</p>

<p>The good news is that the repair was ""only"" the $100 diagnostic fee my local VW dealership charges.</p>

"How to stiffen up a loose ball & socket joint for a motorcycle mirror?","19060","","<p>I have bar-end mirrors on my Buell 1125CR. They're fairly heavy anodized aluminum pieces that pivot on a ball &amp; socket joint for adjusting the angle of view.</p>

<p>One of them fits snugly on the joint, so I can adjust it and it stays in place as I'm riding. The other is looser, so it won't stay in place - if I goose the throttle, it vibrates out of position and just dangles until I readjust it. Obviously that's not the safest thing to do while I'm riding.</p>

<p>Is there some way I can tighten up the ball &amp; socket joint? I'm thinking of some sort of viscous grease that I can inject in there to reduce the amount of play. I considered threadlock or even silicone sealant, but I want to retain the adjustability of the mirror if possible.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>Great solutions, everyone! I really appreciate the help.</p>

<p>In the end, I tried a quick fix with Loctite Blue since I had some lying around. I squeezed out a couple of drops onto the back of the ball so it would drip into the socket, and left it to cure overnight.</p>

<p>This worked reasonably well - the mirror no longer droops under brisk acceleration, although ""flooring"" it still creates enough vibration to shake it out of place, albeit not nearly as much as before. I feared that the Loctite would really sieze up the joint, but it hasn't - it still remains pliable enough to allow me to adjust the mirror.</p>

<p>I suspect that Loctite Green might have done a better job of wicking into the tight void between the ball &amp; socket, so I might try that next, although the set screw idea also sounds viable and should be a permanent solution.</p>

<p>There's probably no ""correct"" solution to this problem, so I've accepted the answer with the most votes.</p>

","<p>I'm not sure how long any sort of grease would last before it worked its way out? I'd be tempted to go for a more mechanical solution (if you have access to appropriate tools, or a frielndly machine shop) - drill a small hole in the socket and tap it to a suitable thread, then insert a grub screw to bear onto the side of the ball and stop it moving.</p>

<p>That way, you still have full adjustability (though you might need to loosen off the screw to adjust it), and you can tighten it up if the joint gets worse.</p>

<ol>
<li>remove leads, apply to terminals, connect leads</li>
<li>do not remove leads, apply to terminals and leads</li>
</ol>
","<p><strong>Evaporated / sprayed electrolyte is corrosive.</strong> If you see corrosion on the battery posts, the leads, or in the vicinity, that's why. A layer of silicone dielectric grease over the exposed metal parts will protect them. I especially like to get some on the threads of screws in that area, to make sure they come apart easily in the future.</p>

<p><strong>You want as much metal-metal surface area as possible between the battery posts and the terminals.</strong> Remember <code>V=IR</code>, which says that as current and resistance increase, so does voltage drop. Resistance is proportional to the cross sectional area of the conductor. So, if you draw a high current through battery leads that don't have much contact area with the posts, you will lose a lot of voltage through that connection (as heat). </p>

<p>So, if you want a really good connection between these metal surfaces, why would you put <em>dielectric</em> (non-conductive) grease in between them? Because these surfaces are not perfectly smooth. At the high points they touch, and at the low points there are gaps. Dielectric grease will get smooshed in to the gaps, keeping out moisture and electrolyte. You only need a very thin layer here, though.</p>

<p>As metal corrodes it expands. This will push apart the metal-metal contact at the battery posts. So, good to have the dielectric grease to stop that corrosion, and good to apply proper torque to the battery terminal.</p>

<p>The only times cars usually see heavy loads is during starting and immediately after as the battery is recharged. You probably won't see enough heat buildup in that time for it to matter much, until you the battery is old and you try to start on a cold morning. Then the voltage drop across the battery connection will be enough to make it difficult to start.</p>

"Tick Tick sound from a Royal Enfield Classic 350 at idle","18885","","<p>I own a Royal Enfield Classic 350. At idle, the engine starts to produce a TICK TICK sound. However it vanishes when the rpm rises and when riding the motorcycle. This question is a very frequently asked question in many of the popular firms and even in that of the Royal Enfield official forums. The official Service center personnel told that its the sound of Automatic De-Compression occurring inside the new UCE (since 2010) engine. (Yes, in the older CI model Royal Enfield Engines, the rider had to manually De-Compress the engine before Kick Starting or else it the kicker would back fire). And i thought decompression was only required at the starting of the Engine or just before the ignition would start and does not have to be done while the engine is running. What really worries me is that i have heard this sound in many other bikes when the piston hits the tappet. OR on other words this is the sound of the piston hitting the tappet or the valves.. Needless to say, improper timing and wrong timing causes the piston to ht the tappet. Due to improper maintenance and ""Do it yourself modifications"" many of my friends have produced the same sound and eventually had to consult a mechanic to fix the issue.

"Should the inflation pressure for low profile tires be the same as for regular tires?","18869","","<p>I always thought that even if you go the large wheel + low profile tire route one should keep the pressure to what's recommended by the manufacturer. However I noticed that some people swear by increasing the pressure significantly when they switch to low profiles. </p>

<p>For example if the manufacturer recommended pressure shown in the owner's manual or on the car body is 2 bar - they'll pump up 3 or even 4 bar for every day driving. The reasoning behind is that in poor road conditions there is a lesser chance of damaging the wheel upon hitting a pothole. Which makes sense, as the wheel is closer to the ground with low profile tires. Higher pressure will make the tires compress less and give the wheels a bit more clearance. I've also heard claims that that the recommended pressure values are for maximum comfort, and higher pressure will improve steering response and cornering stability.</p>

<p>And to be fair, for many cars large wheels and low profile tires aren't among recommended dimensions anyways. It might not make sense to cling to their pressure recommendation when the largest wheel the manufacturer recommends is R16 with 215/45 tires and the owner fit some R18s with 215/30s.</p>

<p>So, should one keep the pressure to what's recommended by the manufacturer regardless of the tire dimensions? Is it beneficial in any situation to increase the pressure of low profile tires? How much is alright without wearing down the tread unevenly?</p>
","<p><strong>tl;dr: it depends. Usually bigger wheels + thinner tires = higher pressure.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, should one keep the pressure to what's recommended by the manufacturer regardless of the tire dimensions?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sort of. If the manufacturer has a recommendation for your wheel and tire dimensions, you should definitely start with those. </p>

<p>If your new wheels are bigger (and the tires are even thinner) than the manufacturer's recommended sizes, you're going to have to start tuning them be feel, research and some math.</p>

<p>Remember, the pneumatic tires are one of the primary undamped springs in the whole suspension system. The air volume in the tire is the first place that feels and absorbs the impact of transients like rocks, bumps and potholes.  The air pressure in the tire is the only defense your expensive new wheels have in this case. Too low and that pothole could bend your new rim.</p>

<p>If pressures are too high, though, you begin to lose the whole benefit of pneumatic tires. The wheel + tire subsystem begins approaching the behavior of a solid wheel. This is, of course, the standard noise, vibration and harshness trade off. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it beneficial in any situation to increase the pressure of low profile tires? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course. Lower pressures will have a larger contact area on each tire. This means that they feel more sluggish on steering input. However, they will also have more grip (higher contact patch area = more grip). Higher pressures will also stiffen the sidewalls. You'll be less likely to roll over the sidewall in a steady state turn. Rolling the sidewall feels terrible, isn't great for the tire and can, in severe cases, pull the tire bead right out of the wheel. However, your wear pattern will begin to accentuate the center of the tire. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How much is alright without wearing down the tread unevenly?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It depends. What trade offs are you willing to make?  Do you have two driven wheels or four?  AWD cars often need the front and rear tires to maintain an expected rolling circumference. </p>

<p>My car, for example, fusses at me when coasting down from speed in second gear if my rear pressures are too high relative to the fronts.  My 16 inch wheel pressure recommendations have the fronts about three psi higher than the rears. The 17 inch wheel pressure recommendations are higher for both and are actually equal. I suspect that that is a consequence of the fact that the higher front end weight causes a more significant impact on the rolling circumference on the smaller wheels. </p>

<p>As always, this is your car. You have to make appropriate choices. </p>

<li><p>The detente at the end of the pawl lifter on the cam driven gear that the shifting shaft acts upon could be getting stuck as it's old and worn out.  The pin costs $2.95 and is worth replacing.  As well, the spring that provides force against the gear shifting cam could be worn is also only $2.95</p></li>
<li><p>The clutch could be dragging just a bit making it difficult to shift into neutral.  This is very common.  Ensure your clutch is adjusted properly by taking up the slack and giving the lever about 2-3mm of play when the handlebars are turned all the way to the left and right which changes play in the cable.</p></li>
<li><p>If the bike is turned off and it is difficult to get it into neutral, push the bike forward and backward which will rotate the secondary shaft in the transmission and allow the dogs and slots on the shafts to line up in order to get into or out of a gear.</p></li>
<li><p>The cam on the shift drum could be worn rather than the pawl.  Inspect the cam for a detente that the pawl has created where it might get stuck on the cam driven gear.

"What can possibly cause an EPS malfunction?","18854","","<p>I am the owner of a Hyundai i20, 2011 model. Yesterday morning, when I started the car, the EPS light stayed on even after the car was turned on. The steering was stiff and being used to power steering all my short driving life (2 years), I struggled to continue driving and parked it again. This EPS issue appeared suddenly, and the last I had driven the car was about 12 hours prior and all was well. There have since been instances where the steering works perfectly fine for a few seconds upto a couple minutes and the EPS light is off, then the EPS light is back on and the steering is stiff again.</p>

<p>Took a day off work and decided to take it to a mechanic. First, took it to a local shop, where the mechanic wanted a payment to even check the issue. So I took it to the Hyundai authorized service centre, where after much waiting, the technician attached a scanner to the car under the steering wheel and ran a diagnostic on the EPS and engine. The technician did not share the details, but what I observed over his shoulder was that after running the diagnostic twice, the program showed that both the engine and the EPS were fine. The technician spoke to a service advisor, who then proceeded to tell me that I would have to replace the entire power steering system at a cost of INR 20000.</p>

<p>Before I commit to making such a massive expense on the car (even though diagnostic tests revealed nothing), I would like to know what could possibly cause an EPS malfunction as I have described. One mechanic claims some kind of motor on the inside is damaged and needs replacement, one claims that the EPS module is faulty and needs to be changed. <strike>My father (a 30 year experienced driver who is in another country) claims it could be due to leakage or exhaustion of power steering fluid.</strike> How should I proceed to try and troubleshoot this issue so I can figure out the problem and verify if I really need to spend a lot to get it resolved?</p>

<p>UPDATE: After research online, I have figured out that there is no power steering fluid because I have an electric power steering system in my car. </p>

<p>UPDATE 2: Finally went to a local mechanic after checking the prices with the service station, which was exorbitant. The issue was with the EPS control unit which lies in the column behind the steering wheel, which was not working fine. The new EPS control unit works fine and so it has been replaced.</p>
","<p>If your electric power steering isn't working it should be setting a code, assuming the control unit has power and you can communicate with it. I believe (all?) Hyundai's put the motor, control unit and sensors in the steering column assembly.</p>

<p>First check your fuses, power loss is more likely than a motor or sensor failure. You could monitor sensor inputs and motor response with a scope or multimeter. Ideally you want a scantool that can communicate with the control module. Control module failure would be the least likely to have failed, unless there are Technical Service Bulletins that reference problems with the module.</p>

"How does ambient temperature affect engine efficiency and fuel consumption?","18740","","<p>I remember from my physics class that the ideal-gas Carnot engine is more efficient if the temperature difference between the heat source and the thermostat (""heat recipient"") is larger (<a href=""http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/thermo/carnot.html"">http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/thermo/carnot.html</a>).</p>

<p>And I always thought that this MIGHT be applicable to real-life engines, so I have to admit, I did expect lower fuel consumption during winter. Alas, I have not yet experienced the money saving power of a winter's frost.</p>

<p>But maybe my measurements were flawed, and combustion engines are indeed more efficient if excess heat is radiated more easily?</p>

<p>PS: I know that a cold engine also means more viscous/thick oil. So I did notice a significant loss of efficiency (power, really) right after starting my motor. But I'm more interested in a stationary situation, when the engine is warm and ready.</p>
","<p>tl;dr: <strong>Ambient air temperature should generally not interfere with engine efficiency or fuel consumption, but will affect overall power output.</strong></p>

<p>Do not confuse <strong>efficiency</strong> with <strong>power output</strong>. These are two separate things. When your intake charge is more dense, you can throw more fuel at it and creates <strong>more power</strong>. (<strong>NOTE:</strong> The idea for the engine management system is to maintain a general 14.6:1 <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air%E2%80%93fuel_ratio"">air to fuel ratio</a> (also called stoichiometric or ""stoic"" for short). This is the so-called ""perfect"" mixture of air and fuel where all of the fuel is burned with no extra oxygen being left afterwards. Unfortunately, the stoic mixture is not usually obtained. This happens because of two problems which arise, both having to do with the amount of heat which is created during the combustion process. First, the hotter combustion can cause detonation. Second, above a combustion temperature of around 1700degF, nitrogen in the air which is brought into the engine (along with the oxygen -- air contains ~78% nitrogen and ~20% oxygen) and burns. This creates NO2 or Nitrogen Dioxide. This is a major air pollutant and was the primary cause of acid rain talked about in the 70's in California. It is also very bad for us to breath -- toxic in fact.)</p>

<p>The flip side of this is <strong>efficiency</strong>, which in the context of engines means getting more usable power from the same amount of fuel. Great strides have been made in the past couple of decades towards engine efficiency. One of the ways they have accomplished this is through turbo-charging. In simple terms, turbo-charging is a way of utilizing the heat energy otherwise discarded in exhaust process. The turbo is able to increase the air charge by using the pressure created from the exhaust gases, which allows the computer to throw more fuel at the intake charge, thus making more power. This could lead to a very large ""other"" discussion, so I'll leave it here. Needless to say, power is made more efficiently through this method than through normal aspiration and thus the engine can make more power with less fuel. </p>

<p>Another way to improve engine efficiency is to increase the compression ratio (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_ratio"">CR</a>) of the engine. A general rule of thumb for CR is, for every point of added CR your power output will raise by about 3%. If you are increasing power output without adding more fuel, this is increased efficiency.</p>

<p>A colder air charge going into the engine will be <em>denser</em> and contain more oxygen than it's warmer counterpart. You are still using more fuel to create more power, thus there is no added efficiency benefit.</p>

<p>While you suggested to not include a cold start-up, there is a reason you will not see better fuel consumption during this period. The reason is because the computer actually throws more fuel into the mix to provide for increased engine stability (help keep it running smoothly -- like a choke would on a carbureted engine) <em>and</em> to help the catalytic converter warm up quicker helping it reach peak efficiency faster.</p>

<p>Actually, combustion engines can be quite a bit <em>more</em> efficient if they can <em>utilize</em> the heat instead of radiating it. Remember that radiated heat is <em>lost energy</em>. If you can utilize the heat to produce more power or create the same power more efficiently, you're just better off all together. </p>

<p>What I'm talking about is a concept a guy by the name of Henry ""Smokey"" Yunick had mastered in the early 80's. He worked off of an idea which Ralph Johnson came up with in the early '50's while Ralph worked at GM. The idea of a <a href=""http://www.hotrod.com/how-to/engine/hrdp-1009-what-ever-happened-to-smokeys-hot-vapor-engine/""><em>hot air engine</em></a> in which the air is heated to around 400degF and <em>homogenized</em> (blended very well) to a point where it would not have detonation. You can read the article, but the reason it is not around in vehicles today is two fold. First, they tried to make it into a bolt-on kit, but couldn't do so because it required upgraded parts for the pistons and rings, which is in effect not so much of a ""bolt-on"" kit and makes it a lot more expensive than the target prices they were shooting for. Secondly, Smokey unfortunately died some time back. Way too many of his secrets died with him as he kept the particulars in his head. This is <em>truly</em> sad, because he did some truly AWESOME work and had  revolutionary inventions and ideas which died with him.</p>

<p>The hot air engine flies in the face of common thinking about cold air induction and your question. Common wisdom states that the colder the air going into the engine, the better the output. And this is basically true with (what we consider today) normal engines (Smokey's hot air engine being an outlier). </p>

"When does it make sense to replace a camshaft?","18718","","<h2>Preamble <sub>(Rant)</sub></h2>

<p>I was reviewing <a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/q/18767/675"">this question</a> in which the OP presents a repair quotation that includes replacing the ""intake camshaft"" to fix an engine that had overheated.</p>

<p>To me this recommendation is incredulous. I can understand the need to replace a warped cylinder head, but struggle to see how an overheating problem could lead to the need for a new camshaft.</p>

<p>As an aside, some aftermarket tuners will create new camshaft profiles by grinding down existing OEM ones; if there was a sensible reason to use a new one I'm pretty sure they would be among the first ones to do so.</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<p>What things could happen to a camshaft that warrant its complete replacement?</p>

<p>For the different ways that a camshaft can fail/break, are there any techniques out there to salvage a damaged camshaft?</p>
","<p>Obviously any physical damage; cracked, broken, bearing surface damage, sheared gear, etc... Any catastrophic failure warrants cam replacement without possibility of repair. </p>

<p>A warped cylinder head could theoretically also warp the cam shaft but i would not just replace it, i would check it first. Place the cam in a set of V blocks. Put a dial indicator on the bearing surface and spin the camshaft. Watch how much the dial indicator deflects. The appropriate engine manual will have the warpage specs. </p>

<p>The more subtle problems arise from lobe wear. A valve that does not open all the way could cause strange problems. At idle everything is fine but a misfire develops under power at high RPM. If the lift of the valve is reduced it won't allow as much air in which is most visible at high RPM. This is difficult to detect. A compression test may not reveal a problem. If every other possible issue is eliminated, pull the valve cover and compare lift of several valves. At worst the lobe is completely round and there is just no air entering or leaving the cylinder. This is easily detectable with a compression test. </p>

<p>Theoretically the worn cam lobe can be reground to regain the lift. The problem with this technique is that not every valve train can compensate for the reduced base circle. Any car with adjustable valves can usually tolerate this. Any car with only hydrolic lifters normally can't.  </p>

"What is the difference between a MAP and a MAF sensor","18689","","<p>Generally a car uses either MAP or MAF to determine the air flow index the engine is getting and that older cars used to have MAP and newer ones often use MAF and cars like the Mitsubishi EVO uses both of them.</p>

","<p>MAP = Manifold absolute pressure and is a sensor to measure vacuum, the computer calculates the engine air flow based on the vacuum, throttle position, and intake air temperature. The computer also measures the barometric pressure using the MAP sensor before the engine cranks, this lets the computer compensate for altitude, or how dense the air is.</p>

<p>Typical GM MAP Sensor</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8rcF7.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8rcF7.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The one above heats a wire and then measures how much the airflow cools it off so it can determine the air flow. While the one below just measures how much the airflow opens the door.</p>

<p>When they fail it causes one or many of the following a very rough running engine, stalls, low power, black smoke as the ECM is delivering fuel based on air flow. They will also set codes related to their systems when there is a problem</p>

<p>Why do manual transmission cars make this noise in reverse gear? Does it work differently than the forward gears?</p>
","<p>In manual transmissions, the reverse gears use a different type of gear teeth than forward gears.  Forward gears are helical gears, which have teeth that are pointed at an angle.  When the gears rotate, most of the load is evenly spread due to the angles.</p>

<p>Reverse gears are cut into spurs, which don't absorb the load quite so well.  As a result, there is more of a whining noise.  The reason reverse gears are spurs is because reverse requires an idler gear to prevent accidentally shifting into reverse while moving.  This is what is known as the gears not being synchronized, and this is also why you cannot shift into reverse when you're moving. </p>

So, you start it up and let it run for a few seconds. There's not enough heat build up to cause any issues, so ... <em>no harm; no foul</em>.</p>

"Failing alternator, idler pulley, or something else?","18377","","<p>I have 1997 Chevrolet Lumina sedan. I’m trying to diagnose a sound coming from my engine.  It is a “whirring” noise that varies with the engine speed (e.g., if I accelerate, the sound becomes louder and the pitch increases a bit). The sound occurs constantly, but is best noticed during acceleration.</p>

<p>About 8 months ago, I heard similar noises and it turned out to be the alternator since the battery was draining and the voltage was below acceptable levels. Had that replaced and the sound went away.</p>

<p>I’ve opened the hood while the car is running, and the sound is definitely in the region of the alternator. However, I also know that an idler pulley with bad bearings can make a similar noise and so too can the power steering system. The power steering fluid is fine; I triple-checked that.</p>

<p>I haven’t noticed any faltering in the electrical system. The interior light doesn’t flicker or vary in brightness with acceleration, the air fan speed doesn’t vary in and out of acceleration, the console lights are fine, and there’s no battery or “Volts” indicator on the console.  I’ve tried turning on all the accessories of the car — headlights with brights on, radio, holding the brakes, interior lights on — to see if an indicator would come on, and nothing.</p>

<p>The noise has only been around for a few hours and it’s only been day time so I haven’t been able to try the headlight trick effectively. Also, it is extremely cold: only about 5 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>Any thoughts on what it could be?</p>
","<p>First and foremost, great presentation, very descriptive. Looking at the <a href=""http://ww2.justanswer.com/uploads/drivefast1971/2010-05-10_161225_1.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">belt diagram</a> on the vehicle it seems that it is in dead one belt. Here is how I would handle this.</p>

<p><strong>If</strong> you have the ability and tools:</p>

<ul>
<li>Remove the serpentine belt and inspect <strong><em>all</em></strong> pulleys <em>(not just the ones in question)</em>
<ul>
<li>In order to remove the belt you will have to pull the spring-loaded tensioner away from the belt. <a href=""http://ww2.justanswer.com/uploads/drivefast1971/2010-05-10_163122_1.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">Reference this photo</a>
<ul>
<li>Be careful when you release the tensioner. When released it will bite you if you're not careful. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Spin the pulleys hand and see if you can get them to make noise.
<ul>
<li>The pulleys should <strong>not</strong> ""spin forever"". <strong>New</strong> pulleys have a slight resistance giving them a <strong>tight</strong> feel while <strong>old</strong> pulleys will make a ""crackling"" type sound from its center <em>(where the bearing sits)</em>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Grab the top and bottom of the pulley and see if it has any play. rocking it against it's center as if it were a see-saw.
<ul>
<li>The pulleys should show <em>very</em> little to no play in them. If they do show a <em>decent</em> amount of movement. It's time to replace them.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>While the belt is off, be sure to check the belt and make sure that it's not getting <strong>chewed</strong> up by any of the pulleys or it's not cracking.
    - I only say this due to the fact that while it's off it's a good time to replace it if it's worn out.</p>

"Can I use high temp RTV instead of a gasket?","18370","","<p>I read somewhere that I can use RTV silicone instead of a regular rubber gasket as an engine seal.<br>
Is this feasible?</p>
","<p>The short answer is no. RTV silicon is a great modern sealant, but must be used in the knowledge that the sealant can block oil ways. It can destroy catalytic convertors, if it becomes diluted by engine oil contact, to the point that it gets left on the cylinder wall during combustion and ends up in the exhaust stream. Oxygen sensors can also be destroyed by being coated in silicon residue. Use only as directed, and replace a gasket with a gasket.</p>

"Does turning off the radio and other electronics in a car before shutting off the engine prevent battery drain?","18296","","<p>My father in law tells me if I leave the radio on in my car when I shut off the engine this will cause a bit of battery drain when I start the car. He says this will actually reduce the life of my battery.</p>

<p>Is this only true with 'older' cars?  If so, before what year?</p>

<p>I'm surprised a modern car doesn't have the electronics to control when the radio kicks in (if it is left in the on position).</p>
","<p>This step is a carryover from days gone by and is not needed in modern vehicles. Batteries from 50 or 60+ years ago were not as powerful or reliable as modern ones. Older batteries had difficulty handling the load of the starter motor alone. Engines cranked longer before starting and were cranking large displacement engines. Any added load from wiper, radio heater fans, etc. while starting may have prevented the engine from starting. Realizing this modern cars disconnect everything that isn't needed to get the engine running during the crank cycle. You can test this yourself by leaving the radio on. You notice the radio plays with the ignition in the ""on"" position but shuts off in the ""start"" position.   </p>

"Which relay to use for bike headlight","18264","","<p>I have Bajaj Pulsar 180 UG4, it has a <strong>35 watt HS1 Helonix</strong> headlamp bulb. I want to upgrade the stock headlight to make it brighter, so I found <strong>H4 Xenon bulb 60/65 watt</strong>. I asked <a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/4683/alternative-to-bajaj-pulsar-180-ug4-stock-headlamp"">this question</a> question and got <strong><a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/a/4686/1522"">this</a></strong> answer from mac. He says I should go for a relay as I want to use a more powerful bulb, but I am not a mechanic so I don't know which relay to use and how to wire it.</p>

<p>Can you please help me in finding correct relay for my bike and how to wire it.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","<p>Your question raises more issues than you probably thought. </p>

<p>With respect to the issue of a relay, then assuming your bike has a 12 volt, negative ground, electrical system, all you need is a generic automotive relay, which looks like <a href=""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:AutomotiveRelay.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> (sometimes called a Bosch relay, regardless of whether it is actually a Bosch unit). <a href=""http://www.autoshop101.com/forms/hweb2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Here</a> is an article, which looks accurate at a skim, that describes how relays work, starting with general information and narrowing down on automotive relays specifically (including the standard pinout of 30, 85, 86, and 87).</p>

<p>Before you get that far, you need to consider the output of your generator (I'm guessing your bike has a generator...but it could have an alternator). Cheaper bikes often have undersized generators, and if your energy requirement exceeds your charging capacity, your battery will run flat even while you ride. On a 12 volt system, the stock bulb pulls approximately 3 Amps (35 Watt / 12 Volts). The replacement will pull around 5-5.5 Amps depending on whether you end up using the low or high beam of the H4 bulb (that's an important difference between the bulbs you mention, and I'm sure you saw this already...the H4 has 3 prongs, a common ground in the middle flanked by the positive leads of the high and low beam filaments). If the only powered accessories on the bike are the lights, this could actually be significant (bikes with provisions for other accessories usually have some headroom).</p>

<p>Next is the wiring going to the headlamps. Obviously, go directly from the battery. Make sure you use a thick-enough wire to prevent excessive voltage drop, which will make the light appear dimmer than it should be and overheat the wire. At the amperage of a single 60 Watt bulb, and the distance involved on a motorbike, 18 gauge (American Wire Gauge, or AWG) is the minimum recommended, but I would suggest 16 or even 14 (no such thing as too much wire, so long as the weight penalty is minimal). Make sure you make your connectors weather proof -- that means sealing any solder or crimp joints with marine-grade shrink tubing (which includes adhesive), unless you actually manage to get your hands on a proper, multi-hundred-dollar crimping tool, in which case just crimp and ride. Otherwise your connectors will eventually corrode and fail, and bikes get wet, so this will happen much sooner than you imagine.</p>

<p>Finally, don't expect miracles. Motorcycle lights usually don't work well, but not because they are underpowered -- because the optics don't work well (reflector and lens). In your case, the 35 Watt bulb is also underpowered...but I'm sure the optics are pretty bad as well. I've been riding bikes for about 25 years, and so far I've owned only one with headlights that were good enough to ride with at night with the same level of visibility as a car. Ironically, that was a relatively inexpensive Kawasaki KLR650 (relatively inexpensive by global standards...very cheap by U.S./Canadian standards). I've had to put auxiliary lights on much more expensive and exotic bikes. All those bikes ran 55 or 60 Watt bulbs, but the inefficient reflectors and/or lenses diffused the light excessively, rendering the headlights effectively dim.</p>

<p>Good luck, have fun with the project, and ride safe.</p>

"What is surging?","18093","","<p>I've been reading a few of the questions here just to learn a bit more about cars out of curiosity and one thing I see quite a bit is the word ""surging"" I searched and I'm not seeing any straight and clear definition of what surging is and how to tell when a car is surging? Can someone explain this to me?</p>
","<p>Surging is when the engine revs change noticeably under constant load and constant throttle (which in theory should result in constant RPM). A very typical one is my Eagle Talon, that had a vacuum leak and at idle the revs would vary between 500 and 1500 rpm as the ECU was trying to control the idle, but didn't know about the additional air.</p>

<p>Another typical one is that if you have either multiple carburetors or multiple throttle bodies on an engine and they are out of sync so one of the cylinders gets a little more air than the other one(s). You can feel it as if the car was accelerating and decelerating a little as you go down the road.</p>

"Clanging in back of Mazda 3","18057","","<p>I have a 2007 Mazda 3 sedan with ~100,000 miles on it (it's the 2.0L version). Last October, I noticed a significant clanging noise that was coming from the rear of the vehicle whenever I went over some small bump. I was told I had a rear spring that was broken, and had both of the rear springs replaced.</p>

<p>Recently, I have noticed a similar clanging sound coming from the back of the vehicle. I took it to a couple of mechanics, and they said that the rear sway bar links needed to be replaced, and showed me how they were loose and had some give in them.</p>

<p>I performed this replacement myself last weekend, and I've noticed that, for the most part, the clanging has gone away. Unfortunately, it hasn't gone away completely. When I go over a major bump, like a speed bump or other major incline with a sharp drop, I still notice a sound like I noticed before. </p>

<p>It's not as significant as I previously noticed, but I'm kind of at the end of what I know in terms of troubleshooting. If possible, I'd like to fix this myself, because I am trying to learn more about how my vehicle works. I don't know how to go about diagnosing the problem, though. </p>

<p>Could it be that I installed the rear sway bar links incorrectly? I've looked at them, and they don't have the give the old ones had, but the one on the passenger side looks like it's at somewhat of an odd angle... this could be my imagination.  Here's a picture of the sway bar link install: </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eDtFA.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>One thing I may have done incorrectly is that I didn't actually remove the sway bar to install the links, I removed the old links and then flexed the new links into position with the sway bar in place. In hindsight, this was probably not a great idea. :| The nuts are nylon lock-nuts, so I'm hesitant to remove them and try to install it again, since this might screw up the nuts.</p>

<p>Is there someone that might be able to give me some pointers as to what I should look for and how I might be able to fix this problem?</p>
","<p>One of the most common cause of broken springs are worn out struts. It is possible that the struts are bottoming out. Does the car have a lot of body sway while cornering? Does it keep bouncing if you push down on the bumper real hard five or six times? Is the rubber suspension stop damaged or missing? Notice any oil stains on the strut body? Any of these are signs of worn struts or shocks.</p>

"Why are drum brakes still fitted on Ford's cars?","18053","","<p>Currently I own a Mk5 Astra SRi, however I am looking to sell this and buy a Ford Focus Mk2.</p>

<p>The other day I looked at a Ford Focus Zetec Mk2. My understanding is that Zetec is sort of the ford equivalent of an Astra SRi (given that ST is the equivalent of a VXR).</p>

<p>The only thing that really threw a spanner in the works for me was the drum brakes on the back wheels. I had a look around and found that the latest two models of VW Polo have discs, as do Golf's from Mk4 onwards, as do most Seat Leons, and even Prius's!</p>

<p>Why on earth would a reputable company still fit this ancient technology, when most modern cars are using rear disc brakes? And, how much of an impact do drum brakes have in comparison to disc brakes?</p>
","<p>Drum brakes are cheaper to manufacture than disc brakes, because there are fewer moving parts and because in the rear the parking brake (which often works by a drum-and-shoe mechanism even on four-wheel-disc-equipped cars) can share a drum with the ""regular"" brakes.</p>

<p>All other things being equal, discs work better than drums, especially in wet conditions.</p>

<p>However, in this case, in regular driving you will very likely never notice a difference.  Most of the braking effort, even in a panic stop, comes from the front wheels.  So front discs are much better than front drums, but rear drums are not much worse than rear discs.</p>

<p>On a side note, they said it shouldn't harm the transmission to continue to drive it like a psuedo-manual. So as long as I shift into L1 when I come to a stop and shift back up to Drive when above 20 MPH, I can get a little more life out of it.</p>

","<p>Yes it can be easily done, but based on your scenario it's not necessary unless you want to sit for extended periods without running the engine.</p>

<p>If you are going to leave the vehicle running for Air Conditioning for instance then you don't need to do anything it should work fine as equipped from the factory.</p>

<p>Here are some things to consider If you still want to install a second battery:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Mounting Location</strong> If there is room under the hood that's the best place, if you have to mount it inside you need to make sure you use a vented (to the outside) battery case. Batteries can put off explosive vapors when they charge and discharge so you don't want it venting inside the vehicle. Location will also limit the physical size of the battery.</li>
<li><strong>Battery Type</strong> I would recommend a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_cycle_battery"">deep cycle</a> battery over a car battery as they are designed to be repeatedly charged and discharged. They are the least expensive options. You can also look at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VRLA_battery"">Gel Cell</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel%E2%80%93metal_hydride_battery"">Nickel Metal Hydride</a> (may not be suited for your application), or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium-ion_battery"">Lithium-ion</a>. The more electrical capacity of the battery you choose the longer you can run without starting the vehicle.</li>
<li><strong>Battery Isolator</strong> This will allow you to charge both batteries automatically but will not let you run down your starting battery. Keep in mind if you are using dome lights or anything else that's factory installed it will run the cranking battery down. You don't have to do this as simply connecting them in parallel will work, you just risk running down the cranking battery.</li>

<p>Edit:  Just for my own future reference; the correct torque for the fill-plug and drain-plug is 30 Newton-meters.</p>
","<p>You should use what your manual specifically says, not the guy at the auto parts store.</p>

<p>Nick C's answer in most situations will probably be correct, that it is just more expensive with more stuff in it that won't apply to your diff and not hurt anything.</p>

<p>However, depending on your specific differential, those additional items could cause problems.</p>

<p>As a point in case, the transmission on my Nissan 300ZX calls for GL-4 gear oil. If you go to an auto parts store and look for GL-4, you most likely won't find any. What you will find is a lot of of GL-5 gear oils that say on the ""meets and exceeds GL-4 standards"".</p>

<p>This works fine for most cases, but what I found out after running a GL-5 ""GL-4 compatible"" gear oil for a few months is that the brass components in my transmission will slowly be damaged by GL-5 gear oil as the standard specifies different levels of acidity, mineral compounds, etc and some of those limits will allow for damage to the softer metal components.</p>

<p>When I removed the GL-5 and put in a proper true GL-4 from Redline Oil (they even mention in the product description that this oil is popular on older Nissan, Toyota, etc transmissions) there was a lot of metal sparkles in the old oil.  Luckily I pulled it in time to where it seems to have not caused major damage, but had I left it in there for a standard change cycle, it could have killed my synchros.</p>

<p>This is likely not the case on your differential but I'd suggest talking to some enthusiasts of your specific vehicle to find out for sure.</p>

"Does a wider tire always mean more grip/traction","17422","","<p>Recently, i had a discussion with someone about tire width. I claimed, that with bigger (wider) tires, a car would have more traction/grip. The person i was discussing this with, agreed with me, up to a certain point. He said, that if the tires were too wide for the car, the opposite would happen, less traction/grip. He also claimed that the chance of aquaplaning would be higher.</p>

<p>My thoughts on that were that that mostly depends on the kind of profile of the tire. It seems to me that if the same tire, on another car (fit for that tire width) would provide good traction/grip without increased aquaplaning risk, the same would hold for a narrower tire. I would argue that the traction/grip is a function of contact with the road and thus wider tires equals more traction.</p>

<p>My question thus is: Does having a wider tires (under the same car) provide more traction?</p>
","<p>Well, both of you are correct. In general terms, a wider tire has a greater contact patch with the ground, so can provide traction. As your friend stated, though, the tread pattern/depth will have a lot to do with how the tire performs during inclement whether. </p>

<p>Take for instance a race tire which is rated at a width of 325mm. With your line of logic, this tire would provide excellent traction for the vehicle. And this would be true, unless the tire was driven on the street where there is water. The car would not have the traction needed to sustain type of safe operation. </p>

<p>Take the same 325mm tire and place it on snow. You can expect a loss of traction. In fact, a skinnier tire will work better in snow than a wide tire would. The reason for this (I believe ... no empirical evidence) is because it has more weight per square inch due to the smaller contact patch. It also cuts through to the ground better instead of riding on top of compacted snow.</p>

<p>There are other factors involved here as well. If a tire is made to last longer (say made of harder rubber), it may not have as good of traction as a tire of the same width and softer material. Tread patterns themselves have a play in traction. Side wall height, tire flex, and inflation also have a play in it. </p>

<p>Another area to consider is what is the physical dimensions of a tire will you be able to fit under your vehicle? There is a trade-off here as well. Another trade-off is cost, the wider the tire, the more expensive it will be (all other things being equal). </p>

<p>Unfortunately, there are so many variables when considering traction, you just cannot put a generalized statement upon a single given factor, which is width in your case. To provide the best tire for your application takes research, bringing all of the factors together to determine your best course.</p>

"What I need to convert a standard Civic into a VTEC","17250","","<p>Ok so my '97 Civic 150i is running a little to slow for my liking. I want it to be able to hang with a 2.0.</p>

<p>The first thing that comes to mind is swapping the motor out to make it the same as a VTEC under the hood.</p>

<p>What I want to know is, do I need to get the entire engine, motor. . .I'm really clueless?</p>

<p>Update; I've converted to a SOHC D16A right now and the mechanic (dad's cousin, so I know I can trust him) said I just need some suspension and brake upgrades/fixes and I can slap a SOHC vtec head on there :D</p>
","<p>From what I understand, the accepted answer is not completely true. You do not need a dual cam setup to run vtec.  I believe your civic has a stock d series engine which is a single cam most, likely a d16 (if you have a d15 it is more complicated).  </p>

<p>The difference is with SOHC there is a common camshaft for both intake and exhaust valves. where as with DOHC there are separate cams.</p>

<p>VTEC is a variable valve timing system which is engaged at higher RMPs so you get better performance when you need it and don't burn extra gas and risk wear on your engine riding around at lower RPMs.</p>

<p>Civics are probably the most commonly modified hondas this question has been asked a million times, luckily that means there is a good amount of information on it.  The first google search I found returned this.  but there are many more some write ups even have detailed step by step picture tutorials.</p>

<p><a href=""http://honda-tech.com/honda-civic-del-sol-1992-2000-1/non-vtec-d16y7-convert-vtec-2531918/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://honda-tech.com/honda-civic-del-sol-1992-2000-1/non-vtec-d16y7-convert-vtec-2531918/</a></p>

<p>At a minimum you will need a d series vtec head, a new ecu, and the wiring harness. <em>(and probably need to replace a few more things like gaskets while doing the swap)</em> also a new timing belt and water pump i believe.</p>

<p>While it is a good idea to upgrade many of the parts in your engine to help cope with the higher RPMs theoretically that isn't necessary, but you run a higher risk, especially if you have alot of miles on your car and like to engage vtec alot (kicks in around 5000rpms depending on the system)</p>

<p>Your mechanic friend is probably just saying cool things you <em>could</em> do.  I believe the civics from that year have the same suspension and braking setups with or without vtec, although there are tons of aftermarket options if you are ambitious and have deep pockets.  Similarly with the DOHC vtec, he was probably saying you should swap a B series motor into the car which is a very popular swap done to civics look (B16, b18, b20, etc).</p>

"Replace front brake pads and rotors?","17167","","<p>I went to my Honda dealership for a B-1 service, and he came back saying that I needed to replace both my front brake pads and rotors. The quote for that is $531. I am wondering if I should go ahead and get it done, or have someone else take a look at it. Any thoughts? </p>
","<p>As already stated, get the estimate on paper with parts and labor broken down.</p>

<p>Go to another shop and get an estimate, tell them reasons related to your car of why you want the estimate, not ""i have this estimate, can you do better"".  If you've noticed vibration under heavy braking, noises or just reached the number of miles where you want them checked for safety.</p>

<p>Then compare the two and armed with that information, you can question either shop about the differences.</p>

<p>""Hey Dealership, explain to me why you want to replace the rotors but Shop B is going to just turn them?"" They might say they are showing signs of damage, too much warping, too thin or ""we can just turn them if that is what you want but next time you will need to replace them"".</p>

<hr>

<p>There will be two big differences between the dealer and a local shop.</p>

<p>Parts cost of OEM vs Aftermarket.  OEM are going to be more expensive then Aftermarket ""OEM Equivalent"" parts (ones built to meet the OEM specs) but will be cheaper then upgraded Aftermarket parts (larger rotors, slotted, drilled, etc).</p>

<p>Neither the dealership or a local shop should change their labor cost if you purchase the parts yourself (as long as there isn't additional work created by what you choose) so go ahead and shop around too.  Depending on what kind of markup they put on their parts, you can save some money this way.</p>

<p>Labor cost should be higher at the dealership.  In some situations it might be worth it to pay the people that are trained for your vehicle, a brake job isn't typically one of those.</p>

<hr>

<p>If you want to go the DIY route, brake jobs are remarkably easy, but I wouldn't go at it alone your first time, we are talking about the device that stops your car after all.</p>

<p>Find a friend that has done it before, doesn't have to have been on a Honda and ask them to go through it with you or someone that is about to do theirs and ask to watch and be an extra set of hands.  Once you've seen it through once, you won't need to pay for a brake job ever again.</p>

<p>If you don't have any car savvy friends, look up a local car club, there are a lot of Honda clubs around.</p>

<p>For example, how does the autobox know to shift down when you hit a gradient? How does it know to shift up at 2000 rpm when driving gently? When driving 'enthusiastically' how does it know to hold the shift until redline?</p>

<p>On a modern vehicle this will be computer controlled.  In addition to the above, how did older analogue transmissions accomplish this before computer controls?</p>
","<p>To put it bluntly, they had to implement a fuzzy logic analog computer based on hydraulics rather than a digital computer based on binary states:</p>

<p>As usual, <a href=""http://auto.howstuffworks.com/automatic-transmission12.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">How Stuff Works</a> has a reasonable introduction to the basic concepts with enough vocabulary to kick off more detailed research if you're really interested.  That link will take you directly to the breakdown of the hydraulic paths and the speed governor.  Those are the core parts required to provide input to that analog computer.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/q46XO.gif"" alt=""A high level summary of the shift circuit as illustrated by How Stuff Works.""></p>

As the governor speeds up, the lower gears cease to be an option.</p>

<p><em>Slightly off-topic: If you have ever worked in any sort of device control situation, these sorts of pictures give you the creeping heebie jeebies.

"What happens if I change the oil when the engine is cold?","17001","","<p>I have always changed the oil in my vehicles with the engine hot, because the manuals always say to let the engine reach normal operating temperature first. Oil change instructions all over the internet say this, too. I've never done it cold because everything says not to, and I never questioned this.</p>

<p>I've burned myself on more than one occasion, last night being the most recent, and it makes it trickier to get the filter out when you have to play Operation on a hot car.</p>

<p>Why do I have to change the oil when the engine is hot and what happens if I do it cold?</p>
","<p>The benefits of changing it hot are the that oil is less viscous, so it flows better, allowing more of the old oil to drain. It will also drain more quickly. </p>

<p>I know when I do mine, I let the engine warm up, but not to full operating temperature. Even through latex gloves, full temp oil would burn my hand, and I can do with that. And getting it at least more than warm but not scalding hot, things flow really well. This way you get the best of both worlds, including not burning yourself.</p>

"disable passenger airbag on Vauxhall Zafira","16935","","<p>How can I safely turn off the front passenger airbag in a Vauxhall (Opel) Zafira MkII (2005-), so that a child seat can be fitted?  This is commonly done with a key in the glove box or switch on dashboard end in other makes of car.</p>

<p>I have found and discarded the following ideas:</p>

<ol>
<li>Discard existing car seats and buy special expensive Vauxhall seats fitted with airbag transponder (discarded as not available online nor at my local dealer).</li>
<li>Persuade your local dealer to disable it electronically.  Some people online seem have succeeded in this, albeit expensively, but apparently most have not, due to ""safety concerns"" which the mythical seat mentioned in 1. avoids somehow.  (my dealer will not do it, discarded as apparently impossible).</li>
<li>Trigger the airbag (discarded as unsafe and stupid).</li>
<li>Several apparently untested suggestions to either disconnect or remove the airbag manually (discarded so far as either impractical, ineffective, unsafe, illegal or combination).</li>
</ol>

<p>Any practical suggestions would be very welcome.</p>
","<p>The thing about airbags is that they make cars safer for the occupants (mostly), this is generally a good thing and a net positive. The trouble is that it then allows car manufacturers to build slightly less safe cars that and still pass crash tests, design regulations and other safety regulations. So the reason that some cars don't have an airbag disabling key in the glove box or elsewhere could be because disabling the airbag would put the car in a state where it would not pass safety regulations so the manufacturer (or relevant government body) decided it would never be a valid option. Of course, another reason is to not fit a disabling key is that its cheaper not to.<br>
This is just a general statement about airbags and the way cars are designed, manufactured and tested these days, it's not specific to the Vauxhall (Opel) Zafira MkII.</p>

<p>Assuming you are aware of all the pros and cons of disabling the airbag (I've only broadly outlined a basic safety issue, there is more than that to consider) your options are very limited because unfortunately you've discarded pretty much everything that is likely to be effective. But I do agree with most of your reasons for discarding them.<br>
Your best bet is to find <strong>another</strong> dealer that <strong>will</strong> disable it for you.<br>
Or try to find someone who isn't a dealer but has the equipment to do it for you. Aftermarket shops are often familiar with the concept because they replace airbag steeringwheels with 'race' ones.<br>
As William Cline has suggested in a comment, you could try to source an appropriate aftermarket OBD system that will allow you to turn the airbag off yourself electronically.<br>
Disconnecting the airbag is still an option, it should be a relatively simple task especially if you can get hold of a decent mechanics manual for the car. There are at least 2 Cons to doing this though: </p>

<ol>
<li>Disconnecting will definitely cause
a 'fault' to be registered somewhere
in the cars electronics and it will
almost certainly cause a warning
light on the dash to be illuminated.
In more modern cars, often once an
Airbag fault is recorded the warning
won't be turned off until a dealer
resets the 'computer' so even if you
plug the airbag back in again, the
warning light will likely remain on.    </li>
<li>You probably won't know 100% for
certain that you have correctly
disconnected the airbag and it's not
something easily tested.</li>

<p>I'm interested in learning to repair my own cars. Am I likely to have more success if I start with a relatively ""basic"" engine? Will an older engine require fewer specialized tools? </p>

<p>What is a good ""starter"" car for this type of project? Two ideas that I have thought of are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Volkswagen type I, II or III (Karmann Ghia/Squareback/Fastback) - I know there are books about old VWs, and lots of information is likely to be found online.</li>
<li>1970's diesel Mercedes (e.g., 300D) - Potentially a conversion to grease-car project. But then maybe getting involved with diesel is a bad idea.</li>
</ol>

<p>I live in southern California, so there are likely an abundance of older model cars without too much rust.</p>
","<p>I'd say there are many pros and cons for newer and older as a starter (I went older, 84 Nissan 300ZX Turbo).</p>

<p><strong>Newer</strong> (lets say 15 years or newer so we are talking about 1996+ which should have ODB2)<br>
<strong>Pros</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>OEM Parts Availability</li>
<li>More Cars in Junk Yard to pull parts from (dependent on production numbers, but still more than older models)</li>
<li>Less wear and tear</li>
<li>ODB2 to get feedback of vehicle status</li>
<li>Less drum brakes!!!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>More electronics, depending on your background, you may have catching up to do on the tech as well as the mechanical</li>
<li>Complexity of systems, safety and emission regulations have added A LOT of equipment to newer vehicles</li>
<li>Engine bay space, almost always when comparing a new and old model the old model looks to have a huge cavernous engine bay.</li>
<li>Originality/Lack of Nostalgia, more of them on the road makes you less special, not a mechanical issue but I think it impacts how much you care about the vehicle.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Older</strong><br>
Well, most of the above for the newer, just reverse the pros and cons and those are the Older list primarily.  </p>

<p>One thing that seems to be heavily debated is Carburetor VS Fuel Injection (FI).</p>

<ul>
<li>If you learn on FI, then carburetors are a mysterious beast that make no sense.</li>
<li>If you learn on carburetors, then FI is a mysterious beast that makes no sense.</li>
</ul>

<p>I say, get what peaks your interest the most, that is what you are going to care about the most and have the desire to get right.</p>

<p><strong>Find a Car Club</strong><br>
Having an active car club community for the vehicle is my biggest recommendation I can give as far as a deciding factor. Look for one that hosts Tech Sessions or Garage Days or whatever name they come up with. These are events organized by club members to get together and work on their cars. It can be one person's car accomplishing a specific project (mine has done the clutch package on my car, suspension on another members, adjustable sway bars, brake pads and bleeding, etc) or it can be everyone showing up with tools and intended projects to accomplish and sharing knowledge and assistance accomplishing the projects.</p>

<p>A car club should be very welcoming if it is a good community.  You can visit their meeting as a guest before you've even purchased a car to get to meet some people, get an idea of what the community is and ask them about advice on picking the car (someone may even know of a good one for sale). They will be far better information resources on the specific vehicle then we could ever try to be.  Also see if they have any public events, car shows, cruises, etc that you can go and see their cars all prettied up and on display. This is another great time to talk to them and get more information.</p>

<p>If you look through my other answers on the site regarding learning you will notice a common theme of, along with specific advice, I mention getting into a car club. I've only been actively doing my own car repairs and maintenance since the beginning of this year. I had bought my car last year and joined the local Z club. In March we started doing monthly-ish (whenever we have time and a project) Tech Sessions starting on the clutch, flywheel and adjoining bits and pieces on my car. So my first ever car project was dropping the transmission in my car. Having the knowledge and support of 3-4 fellow club members and a fully stocked garage for the 13 hour project was invaluable. No matter how much reading, forum searching, etc I had done I couldn't have pulled the job off myself (If I had read online to get the transmission to line back up you had to wiggle the transmission jack back and forth sideways while pushing forward to get it to rotate to line up the splines to slide back in, I wouldn't have believed it, but that is what we had to do).</p>

<p>Through the Tech Sessions with my club, now I've been able to do a lot of work on my car myself (after we did a fellow members brake pads and bled the brakes, I went home and did it on mine) and am able to be sharing my experience with people here because of what I've learned.</p>

  <li><strong>Cold-Cranking Amps (CCA)</strong> - A rating that is used to define the battery's ability to start an engine under low-temperature conditions. BCI defines it as ""the number of amps a lead-acid battery at 0ºF (-17.8ºC) can deliver for 30 seconds and maintain at least 1.2 volts per cell (7.2 volts for a 12-volt lead-acid battery). </li>
  <li><strong>Nominal Voltage</strong> - The rated voltage of a battery</li>
  <li><strong>Closed-Circuit Voltage (CCV)</strong> - The voltage of a battery when the cell or battery is under a specific discharge load and time interval. See also Open-Circuit Voltage.</li>
  <li><strong>Reserve Capacity (RC)</strong> - BCI defines it as ""the number of minutes a new, fully-charged battery at 80ºF (27ºC) can be discharged at 25 amps and maintain a voltage equal to or higher than 1.75 volts per cell"" (i.e., 10.5 volts for a 12-volt battery).

"Difference between mineral engine oil and synthetic engine oil","16783","","<p>I would like to know the exact difference between mineral engine oil and synthetic engine oil.</p>

<p>Why is it advised to use mineral oil for the engine when the bike is new and later switch to synthetic oil when the bike has done considerable number of Kms.</p>
","<p>Mineral Oil is naturally occuring oil.</p>

<ul>
<li>They provide the least protection to engine components.</li>
<li>They are cheap.</li>
<li>They need to be changed often.</li>
<li>Cant withstand high temperature</li>
</ul>

<p>Point number 1 is the reason why mineral oil is recommended for break in periods since it allows the engine components to wear and set in more comfortably in other words , due to its poor protection the engine components wear perfectly like the cylinder bore for optimum engine break in procedure.</p>

<p>Synthetic oils can be a amalgamation of man made oil + mineral oil or fully man made oil.</p>

<ul>
<li>They are the best, they provide highest level of protection for engine components.</li>
<li>Much more smoother engine compared to mineral oil.</li>
<li>Lasts much longer than mineral oil.</li>
<li>Little bit expensive compared to mineral oil.</li>
<li>Can withstand high temperatures.</li>
</ul>

<p>Synthetic oil has two further classifications:</p>

<ol>
<li>Semi synthetic </li>
<li>Fully synthetic</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Semi synthetic</strong> oils are usually blended from Group 3 base oils (group 3 is a lower spec base oil which is made by using a process called ‘hydro-cracking’ to convert natural oil into suitable base oils). Some better quality semi synth oils can contain some Group 4 base oils (group 4 base oils are completely man made, synthetic base oils made from various blends of chemicals).</p>

<p><strong>Fully synthetic</strong> oils are blended using Group 4 base oils (which are man made, synthetic bases blended from various chemicals). Fully synthetic oils are blended with various different additive packs to obtain the required viscosity (e.g. 10w40) and characteristics.</p>

<p>Synthetic/fully synthetic oils do not allow engine components to wear as much as mineral oil thus they are not suitable during break in periods.</p>

","<p>In an automatic transmission there is a ring with teeth on the output shaft of the transmission. When the transmission is shifted into park a lever called the parking pawl is lowered against the ring. If the parking pawl did not land squarely into an opening in the ring the car will roll slightly and there will be a usually an audible click.

Theoretically with park engaged also applying the parking brake is not necessary unless the car is on a big hill because the parking pawl has more than enough strength to hold the car from rolling. It is a good idea to exercise the parking brake on a car with an automatic so the system does not freeze up. </p>

<p>PS. In a manual it is suggested to place the car in first gear or reverse then engage the parking brake and for good measure curb the wheels. In the event that the parking brake fails (more common than the parking paw) the engine with the sub one gear ratio will hold the car. The good measure of curbing the wheels will roll the car into the curb in the case that the engine can't hold the car from rolling. </p>

"What does a healthy spark plug look like?","16733","","<p>The spark plug pictured here:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yy6o3.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Has some black carbon on the underside of the ground electrode and has black carbon on the ""base"" area below the centre electrode (not pictured). Is this normal and healthy for a fuel injected engine? Or, does this suggest too ""rich"" a fuel/air mix?</p>

<p>What are some other signs of spark plug health related to fuel mixture and spark plug gap to look for when pulling and inspecting a plug?</p>
","<p>I think your example is running pretty good, but may be a tad on the rich side. Nothing much to worry about. If it were running a tad bit leaner, the plug would have more of an tan/ash color to it. When reading the plug, don't pay as much attention to the bit at the top of the threads. This area is prone to have some minor carbon build up no matter how well the plug is running. This is because of it's location and proximity to the head. This area will run a bit cooler as well as like to trap a tiny bit of fuel which causes the carbon deposits. The electrode and ground electrode are the two areas you should concentrate on.</p>

<p>As for other examples and what to look for, here is a chart which shows pretty well a good range of what spark plugs might look like. </p>

"Jump starting a dead battery: Connect black wire to negative pole of battery or grounded metal?","16629","","<p>Most of the advice I've seen for jump starting cars instructs to connect the black wire to a bare piece of metal on the car with the dead battery. However, I've always just hooked up both poles to the corresponding poles on the other car's battery. I've never experienced any negative consequences, and it has always worked fine. </p>

<p>Out of curiosity, does it matter, and if so, why?</p>
","<p>From an electrical perspective, it doesn't matter.</p>

<p>However, a lead-acid battery that is charging or discharging rapidly will give off hydrogen, which is highly explosive.  Since you generally make the ground connection last, there's a good chance that you'll get a spark, which is enough to ignite the hydrogen.</p>

<p>So while it's unlikely that you'll have anything explode, under extreme conditions it's possible.  Making the ground connection away from the battery eliminates the possibility.</p>

<li>If your fluid low or do you have a leak in your system.  (Check it everyday and make sure you are not losing fluid)</li>
<li>Is your coolant mixed correctly.  (Make sure you aren't filling up the system with just water or just antifreeze.  Buy pre-mixed or mix it yourself to the right proportions).</li>
<li>Replace your thermostat.  (This is normally a very cheap replacement and most likely need to be replaced).</li>
<li>Check your radiator cap (Make sure it holds pressure, if in doubt they are cheap to replace).</li>
<li>Check the Water Pump, Radiator, Hoses (The hose that brings coolant from the engine to the radiator should be hot)</li>

"Does the Timing Chain Need to be Replaced on the 2008 Toyota Sequoia at 90,000 Miles?","16584","","<p>The service manual that came with my vehicle recommends replacing the timing belt at 90,000 miles.  It has a note at the bottom of the page though that this is for the 2uz-fe engine only.  Apparently that's the 4.7 L, mine is the 5.7 L.  I'm not a car guy so didn't really understand the difference between the timing belt and chain and such.  Anyway I went to my mechanic and showed him the service manual and asked him how much it would cost to do all the required maintenance.
He looked at it carefully and even asked me what type of engine mine was (whether or not it was the 4.7 L, etc). 
He then said the timing belt was really hard to replace labor wise and that was like 10 hours.  He said if the manual said it should be replaced then i definitely should or else the engine could get damaged.
I think he said all this in good faith.
However, then he called to get a quote on the parts and I heard something mentioned about a chain.<br>
So ... then he quotes me $850 to do the job.
I'm reading online and finding out that apparently a chain doesn't need to be replaced when the belt does as the chains are designed to last longer.</p>

<p>So what I'm hearing is that this isn't necessary, is that right?
Should I feel like he tried to rip me off?
Does the chain ever need to be replaced - any idea when?</p>

","<p>The 5.7L engine (3UR-FE) does have a timing chain, while the 4.7L engine (2UZ-FE) uses a belt.</p>

","<p>Provided the threads are damaged, one could drill out the hole and place a <a href=""http://www.helicoil.in/"" rel=""nofollow"">heli-coil</a> thread insert (or similar) into the now-larger hole. Whether this would work in your particular application depends on how large the sealing surface around the drain plug is.</p>

<p>One company markets a <a href=""http://www.timesert.com/html/drainplug.html"" rel=""nofollow"">threaded bushing</a> to repair oil pan drain plugs that performs a similar function. </p>

<p>If it were my car, I wouldn't want to do this without pulling the oil pan off the engine, to make sure that any metal chips from the drilling operation don't remain in the oil pan, as they could do damage to the engine.</p>

<p>So from a comparative standpoint, either way you need a new oil pan gasket, and either way you'll be paying for the labor of removing and re-installing the oil pan. The heli-coil approach has the additional labor of preparing the hole and installing the heli-coil, plus very likely the minor additional cost of a new (larger) drain plug and gasket.</p>

<p>For my money, I'd go with a replacement oil pan. If you can find a decent salvaged pan and save some money that way, great.</p>

"Buzzing noise or whining noise from center of car while driving, not related to engine speed","16545","","<p>My 2003 Passat B5 TDI with 6-speed gearbox is making a buzzing/whining(?) noise while driving and it appears as if it comes from under the gear shifter.</p>

<p>The noise is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dependent on road speed (more audible between 60 kph and 120 kph)</li>
<li>Not dependent on engine speed</li>
<li>Also audible when gear is in neutral</li>
<li>Not dependent on clutch being pressed or not</li>
</ul>

<p>When accelerating, the noise is there but less audible (probably because the noise of the engine masks it). It is much more audible in neutral or in 4/5/6th gear while decelerating.</p>

<p>Also, when the car is in 4/5/6th gear if I gently press the gear knob up (in 5th) or down (in 4/6th), the noise gets worse.</p>

<p>You can hear the noise in this audio file:
<a href=""http://goo.gl/qXX8x1"">http://goo.gl/qXX8x1</a></p>

<p>Could someone help me diagnosing where the noise is coming from?</p>

<p>I'm ruling out clutch and gearbox because happens in neutral and is not dependent on engine speed. Is this correct?</p>

<p>Could it be the differential? Could it be the U-Joint? Drive shafts?</p>
","<p>While it is difficult to diagnose car sounds over the Internet, I would say pretty confidently that the sound is coming from the transmission for the reasons below;</p>

<p>You have stated that the pitch of the sound follows the speed of the vehicle, which would lead me to believe this is specifically the final drive or 'differential' (inside the transmission on a transaxle) rather than a specific gear that is causing the noise.</p>

<p>If the vehicle is moving, the final drive is moving. Specific gears or neutral makes no difference.</p>

<p>Under acceleration the output-to-final drive gears are meshing on the 'leading' side of the teeth, which makes a specific sound. Under deceleration they are meshing on the 'trailing' side of the teeth which makes a different (usually louder) specific sound. The sound is created by the two gears being too far apart (like tenths or hundredths of a Millimeter) - see 'backlash' <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlash_%28engineering%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlash_%28engineering%29</a></p>

<p>Different car speeds (and thus, frequencies of the gears teeth meshing) will increase and decrease the intensity of the sound as it passes through different 'Harmonics' - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic</a>. Around 90kph (55mph) seems to be a fairly common speed to hear intense harmonics, which is right in the middle of your 'more audible' range.</p>

<p>Pushing on the shifter can preload things inside the transmission and by way of transference is pulling the aforementioned gears apart increasing the backlash, thereby increasing the noise.</p>

<p>The final drive is usually close to the middle of the car, near the shifter.</p>

"Rattling/tinkling noise under load - is this knocking/pinking/misfiring?","16491","","<p>I have 99 SEAT Ibiza, which was until quite recently owned and driven by my mother. It's therefore been well cared for, but was hardly ever given a good run or allowed to get warm. On its last major service - which was early this year - the oil was a suspicious colour which the guy said can warn of head gasket failure, but given the treatment it's had, he figured it was more likely to just be residual moisture that hadn't been given a chance to cook off.</p>

<p>Anyway, for a few weeks I've been noticing a light tinkling sound coming from the engine bay when accelerating. I change gear early for reasons of economy, and being a fairly new driver I don't always time it right and the engine can struggle under load. The noise is most noticeable changing from 3rd to 4th at around 2000rpm then applying some firm throttle.</p>

<p>From the information I have and what I've read, I suspect engine knocking or misfiring. Detonation due to dirty plugs would fit the treatment it's had previously - short runs would tend to cause crud buildup, or so I gather. A friend has offered to help me inspect the distributor cap and spark plugs, but is there anything else I need to be aware of or look for? </p>

<p><strong>edit #1:</strong></p>

<p>Thanks folks. Taking advice, I've gotten into the habit of leaving the gear change til later - usually 2.5 to 3k, and the problem has pretty much disappeared.</p>

<p>I've also taken to giving it a blast up to 5k RPM when joining the highway each morning to clear away the cobwebs...but we won't tell anyone about that, will we?</p>
","<p>First, I think you're changing gear way to early if you're changing up from 3rd to 4th at 2000rpm, especially when the engine is under load. There's a reason the redline is higher than that :). You're not really doing yourself a favour with that, and neither are you doing the engine a favour.</p>

<p>Knock or pinging is usually caused by the fuel burning uncontrolled and at the wrong time.</p>

<p>There are a couple of problems that can causing engine knock/pinging:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wrong or dirty spark plugs</li>
<li>Ignition timing off</li>
<li>Mixture lean</li>
<li>Using fuel with the wrong octane rating (too low)</li>
<li>Too much load on the engine for the rpm</li>
<li>Deposits in the combustion chamber that heat up to the point that they can ignite the air/fuel mixture</li>
</ul>

<p>I think giving the ignition a service (ie, new plug, distributor cap and rotor if the engine still has one of those, plug leads of those look like they're original) is a good starting point.</p>

<p>Also, if it hasn't been changed I'd change (or have someone change) the fuel filter, these fill with crud over time and if it's partially clogged this can reduce fuel pressure and cause a lean-ish mixture. I'd also run some fuel system cleaner through the tank (or use a tank or two of something like Shell V-Power that has additional cleaning ingredients) and take the car out for a good run outside of town.</p>

<p>Don't be afraid of revving the engine and driving it hard(er) (aka the ""Italian tuneup"") as you want to make sure that everything gets up to operating temperature and possible deposits get a chance to burn off.</p>

<p>Typically they are just attached by 5-10 screws or fasteners.</p>

<p>The purpose is to keep dirt and liquids coming up into the engine bay.</p>

"Difference between water pump and water outlet housing","16297","","<p>I recently took my car into the shop because I was leaking coolant. (I thought it was tranny fluid.

<p>What they said needed to be fixed was a replaced water pump.</p>

<p>Last summer (less than 12 months ago, so still under warranty) I got my water pump fixed. My receipt says ""Diagnose and replace water outlet"" with ""4792630AA Housing-Water Outlet"" as the part. What is the difference between this piece and the water pump? Should it have still been under warranty?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>The water pump is a mechanical pump that is one of the belt driven devices in your engine.</p>

<p>This pump is what circulates the coolant (when the parts are referred to for water, they mean coolant. Water hoses, water outlet, water inlet, water pump, etc are all carrying coolant).</p>

<p>The water outlet is simply a pipe, on one end of it is the engine block, on the other end is a hose that is connected to the radiator.</p>

<p>There is both a water inlet and a water outlet, these are the two points in which the coolant flows in and out of your engine block.</p>

<p>Since yours was a water outlet ""housing"" it may be the location of your thermostat. On my engine, the thermostat housing is connected to the water inlet, not outlet.  I'm sure manufacturers use different locations and naming theories all the time though.  The housing contains the thermostat which is a temperature sensitive device that determines whether your coolant cycles through the radiator or not.</p>

<p>When you've first turned on your vehicle, you want it to get up to operating temperature, so you don't yet want to be cooling the coolant through the radiator, so the thermostat keeps it blocked off until reaching a certain temperature.  Once it reaches that temperature it opens up allowing the coolant to flow through the radiator to get cooled.</p>

<p>The water outlet could leak due to corrosion, some failure point in the metal or to a faulty gasket.</p>

<p>Depending on your vehicle and the shop you took it to (I'm guessing dealership), $1200 doesn't surprise me to replace it.  The water pump is typically done at the same time as the timing belt because you have to take off almost all of the same parts to get in there.</p>

<p>I'll be changing my water pump on my car this weekend just because I'm already going to have my radiator out and hoses off.  The water pump if I had purchased OEM would have been $100 instead of the $30 I'm paying for an aftermarket one so there is some difference there but most of that $1200 is probably labor.</p>

"Burning smell, leak, losing power. Maybe transmission related","16253","","<p>First off, I know almost nothing about cars. I can fill them up with gas and drive them. That's about it. This car is a '99 Subaru Outback, automatic.</p>

<p>When I last took my car in for an oil change, the mechanic said that I was leaking transmission fluid and that he'd clamped it and refilled it. After the oil change, I noticed a burning oil smell after the car had been running for a while. I assumed that some of the leaking transmission fluid got on the engine and was burning off. Annoying, but probably not a problem, or so I thought.</p>

<p>I also didn't notice any puddles under where I parked my car, further causing me to believe that I wasn't leaking anything.</p>

<p>That was a few weeks ago. I don't drive very much, though, so not many miles ago.</p>

<p>Today I drove about 15 miles to pick someone up and go to an event. Everything seemed fine, except the burning smell, but even the burning smell wasn't as bad as it usually was. I also got the car washed.</p>

<p>The car sat in the parking lot for around 9 hours. When I went to take my friend home, I noted that the car seemed to be a bit sluggish. In particular, after a stop, it would go very slowly and the engine would rev very high before it would go from first to second. After dropping my friend off, it just got worse and worse. Before long, it was taking a while to change between every gear.</p>

<p>When I finally get home, there's a sharp turn, a relatively steep hill up, and a relatively steep hill down. Because of the turn, I needed to slow down, and I only made it half way up the hill before my car wouldn't move any more. I pushed the engine pretty hard, getting it up to 5 or 6k on the tachometer, and nothing. Eventually I had the bright idea to put it in first gear manually, and I was able to get it moving again up the hill and eventually to my parking space.</p>

<p>So... That's where I am now. So one big problem here is I don't know that I'll even be able to get the car to a mechanic, because just to leave my place I need to go up and down a hill. Based on the fact that the mechanic who changed my oil told me I was leaking transmission fluid, I'm assuming that he didn't actually fix the problem as he claimed he had. </p>

<p>Is it likely that I can refill the transmission fluid, to at least get the car into a state where I can get it to a mechanic without a tow truck?</p>

<p>But I'm doing a whole lot of assuming here, hence why I'm asking for advice. If it does turn out that refilling the transmission fluid is the best course of action, is there anything special I need to know about doing that? Like I said, I know pretty much nothing about cars.</p>
","<p>It is actually really difficult to top this up yourself - the easiest route is in through the transmission dipstick, so you'll need a long funnel.</p>

<p>First, find the dipstick - it will be inwards and down below the fuel filter (your manual should show you where) - it will have a yellow circle at the end, for your finger to pull it out.</p>

<p>Then see how full the dipstick indicates your transmission fluid level - if it is fine, leave it alone - you may have something else wrong with your car, and should get it checked out at a garage.</p>

<p>If it is low, you can start to pour. Don't put too much in at first, until you have a good estimate of how full it is.</p>

<p>From an American site I learned that the Subaru Outback 4EAT transmission requires 9.8 quarts of ATF, but it is tricky to equate that with an indicator level on a dipstick.</p>

"Audi A4 2007 2.0T boosts but poor performance, fuel economy","16220","","<p>My 80,000 mile 2.0TFSI Turbo Audi has lost a lot of performance but produces no check-engine-light (CEL) or codes.  One month ago an independent garage looked at it and did $2200 of work including transmission fluid, air and fuel filters, new sparks etc...</p>

<p>When I got it back it was fixed, and boosting with a healthy <em>sssh</em> on acceleration from 2200 RPM, which lasted for about 6 days and then suddenly back to poor performance or worse, and no noise from the turbo except at 6000 when high pitched whistle/whine evident.  Fuel economy seems really bad - about 15MPG.</p>

<p>Took it back to garage for smoke test, vac test etc. but still no CEL or codes. They say it's boosting at 7psi, but that they feel a lack in performance. I guess they used a physical gauge, but I don't know how or where they took that reading.</p>

<p>The right hand curve below is me accelerating from 10 to 45 in 10 seconds, throttle mostly open, then foot off the accelerator.  I max out at 4870rpm and 20lb! of (dashcommand estimated) boost  and lambda hits .7, HP hits 97.  It's supposed to be a 200 hp car :-(.</p>

<p>Can charge air sensor tell me a MAP that might show air leaks between the MAF and the manifold? (answer - that's the right sensor)</p>
","<h2>Problem solved : sticking valve in turbo</h2>

<p>After running a solenoid check at the independent mechanics - which toggles the solenoids for as long as you like, I get power and turbo back with a vengeance.</p>

<p>This means the problem is with a sticking solenoid in one of the turbo valves - either the wastegate or the diverter valves.  The mechanic mentioned as we were running the test that this often unsticks solenoids, so I asked him to let it keep clicking for a whole minute.</p>

<p>Neither of these is very expensive.  Now I'm just going to wait until it fails again, and get it replaced. </p>

<p>The diverter valve was replaced by audi less than a year ago, so will still be under warranty, and given that I was getting boost (MAF records lots of air going in) I think that's the most likely candidate.</p>

"Do fault codes get recorded with a time stamp into a log with a history of DTCs?","16167","","<p>Just scanned my vehicle for the first time to check out the code for a Check Engine Light. I grew curious if these fault codes get logged somewhere with a date and time stamp of some kind at the time they were thrown. I'm imagining some design similar to the <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb726966.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Event Log</a> used in computer operating systems but I may be totally mistaken on this one.</p>

<p>What exactly is the design around these fault codes as far as how they're recorded. One obvious aspect of the design is the use of unique codes specific to some particular problem. Is that the full story with a fault, are there any other metadata surrounding a fault instance that can be looked up? How do fault histories work in vehicles? Are histories even recorded or are faults simply a binary thing, either on currently or off currently regardless of whether they were ever on at any point in the vehicle's life. I know you can clear codes using scanner tools, is this to suggest that faults would stay flagged on a system in perpetuity until you manually clear them? This would lead me to believe that the check engine light would remain illuminated even after repairing the root cause of a fault. Is this accurate?</p>
","<p>It really depends on the implementation of OBD2.  What my 1997 Subaru logs (virtually nothing) compared to a 2015 Chevy Cruise are entirely different things.</p>

<p>However, in most cases, a Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) is logged with a <em>freeze frame</em>, which is a complete store of all Parameter ID's (PIDS).  These parameters cover everything from RPM, vehicle speed, O2 sensor data, mass airflow data, long and short term fuel trims, ignition advance, intake and coolant temperature, and perhaps dozens more.  These are accessed via OBD2 Mode 2.  The simple ""Pxxxx"" DTC faults are accessed via OBD2 Mode 3, which is often the extent that simple consumer scan tools are able to display.</p>

<p>On more sophisticated scan tools, Mode 2 ""freeze frame"" data can be displayed, which is invaluable data as it reveals the exact running condition at the very instant the DTC code was set.</p>

<p>The <em>history</em> of such codes again varies with the implementation of OBD2, and quite likely how new the vehicle.  On my 1997 Subaru, data is limited -- given that OBD2 wasn't a mandate until the 1996 model year.</p>

<p>However, all vehicles have two categories of DTC:  ""Pending"", which is a detected fault, but doesn't set the Check Engine Light (CEL, SES) until the condition is detected again a certain number of times.  (This is accessed through OBD2 Mode 7.) The number of ""drive cycles"" required to promote a ""pending"" to a CEL depends on the fault, the implementation, and the vehicle.</p>

<p>The other category of DTC is ""stored"" or ""logged"".  These are true fault codes that have been promoted from ""pending"" status to a real-deal fault code, and they by OBD2 definition <em>must</em> set the CEL.</p>

<p>In addition, some Engine Control Units/Modules (ECU/ECM) have the capability of logging a few or dozens of ""historical"" fault codes, regardless if they have been repaired and/or cleared.  This provides background to an astute technician, even when there is no current <em>pending</em> or <em>logged</em> DTC faults.</p>

<p>DTC codes do NOT have to be cleared ""manually"".  If the condition that caused the fault is repaired, or simply no longer occurring (P0420 catalyst efficiency a classic example) the code will ""clear itself"" so to speak after a certain number of drive cycles without the fault reoccurring.  The number of drive cycles required to clear an active CEL DTC depends on the fault and software implementation.  In most cases, however, a technician clears these codes after a valid repair to assure the customer that the repair is complete.  But we don't HAVE to; it's a courtesy.  The ECU/ECM constantly monitors the PID and emission conditions, and will eventually relent, given enough ""clean"" drive cycles.</p>

<p>As an aside, there is a category of DTC that cause a <em>FLASHING</em> CEL.  These differ dramatically from the ""solid on"" CEL, in that if it comes on and stays on, it's an indication that something is wrong, and the driver should seek service at a convenient opportunity.  However, a <em>FLASHING</em> CEL indicates something severely wrong that could cause vehicle damage.  Usually, this is indication of an overly rich condition, usually caused by severe ignition faults or fuel injection that if left alone could damage an expensive catalytic converter.  These ""flashing"" check engine lights should be addressed immediately -- some OEMs suggesting pull the vehicle over and have it towed.</p>

<p>To further complicate this process, clearing a CEL gets rid of the fault code from the ""active"" category, but like your computer analogy, it's an ALT_CTRL-DEL.  It completely resets the ECU/ECM, and clears out what is referred to as the ""monitors"".</p>

<p>The monitors are a whole plethora of tests which run either continuously, or in most cases when certain PID (temperature, engine load, fuel level, drive cycle) criteria are met.  (This is what makes it particularly difficult to pass evaporative emission system monitors; the criteria are exact and even depend on how much fuel in in the tank.)</p>

<p>It takes a certain number of successful drive cycles, obeying all the requisite criteria, to ""pass"" these monitor tests.  At this point the vehicle can pass an OBD2 emissions inspection -- when all monitors have passed.  (In New York, vehicles produced prior to 2001 can have two incomplete monitor tests, 2001 and newer are allowed one, and it may be that recent vehicles are allowed <em>none</em> incomplete.  This is just trivia.)</p>

<p>The upshot is that while a vehicle may have had proper repairs and the fault codes cleared, this does NOT mean it will pass an OBD2 emissions inspection.  This prevents the shadetree technique of disconnecting the battery and taking it immediately to inspection.  The vehicle must complete the requisite number of drive cycles with all (or most) criteria met in order to get the passing grade.  While a so-called ""not ready"" vehicle doesn't <em>fail</em> emissions testing, it also doesn't pass.  After the ALT-CTRL-DEL ECU/ECM lobotomy, the vehicle settles in and doesn't become ""ready"" for inspection until it proves to itself that all monitors are go, and the vehicle is running clean.</p>

"Amp Install Question. Splice in pre or post factory amp?","16137","","<p>I am planning on installing an amplifier in my 2008 Mustang and hoping to keep the factory head unit for now. My amplifier supports high level input through the RCAs.</p>

<p>My question is should I splice/solder the adapters in at the factory head unit (before factory amp). Or at the speakers (after factory amp).</p>

<p>I believe that the factory system has fade/balancers built into the amps so I would lose those if I went from the head unit but I am thinking it is the right way to do it?</p>

<p>If I go from the head unit output do I need to have a summing unit or can I just leave it as is? I am assuming the amp will just amplify each channel based on what is received from the head unit that way (not sure if it does any frequency filtering at that point or if it is done at the factory amps).</p>

<p>Please give me your suggestions. I'm not too fussed about keeping fade/balance.</p>
","<p>So you want to keep the factory amp? I wouldn't suggest that. I'd recommend getting rid of the factory amp altogether, they're usually not the best, and it would be difficult - if not impossible - for them to work together.</p>

<p>I google'd for a quick sanity check and I'll post a snippet from WikiAnswers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I wouldn't...first most after market amps require a certain amount of power for proper function, such as a good ground, a good power source, some sort of RCA audio input, and a remote turn on. I know trying to figure out the same thing once. Plus most factory amps are just a plug of 16 gauge wires, and by time you through all of them to figure out power,ground,and remote, you still have to figure out how to send and input to your after market amp. Lets say you did do it and figured it all out, once you turn your deck on the after market amp probably would go right into protect due to not having enough power...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even if you wired it up right I have a good feeling it wouldn't sound good. One exception I can think of is that some amps have a type of 'line out' where they directly support daisy chaining to additional amplifiers. Typically the amps have to be the same model/family to work in this manner though, to sync the power being delivered to the speakers, and other low level audio/power stuff that's currently beyond me. </p>

<hr>

<p>For a solution though, If your factory unit has Pre-amp outputs, then you have your answer: Run a pair to your aftermarket amp, and you'd be good to go. If not, then a line-level converter is the route you'll have to go.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hwEKt.jpg"" alt=""Line level converter""></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>You definitely want to use the low-level (RCA, pre-amp) outputs from your factory head-unit if available. That way you don't get amplified noise from your head-unit, which goes to your shiny new amp that you can't crank up because it will start to clip at a very low level. That way, you get an unamplified signal going to your amp, which is precisely what it wants.</p>

<p>YMMV, but I know older factory head-units don't have pre-amp outputs. If it does, then awesome. You also asked for where to splice: I'm assuming that's for if your radio doesn't have pre-amps. However you said your amp has high level inputs, if that's the case then there I would splice close to where the amp is going to go, this will minimize or eliminate more splices. Typically the connectors that come with amps for high level input don't have a lot of wire on them(see below), so you'll <em>have</em> to splice close to the amp, and since you're running all new wire you can run wire straight from your HU right up to the amp and splice there.</p>

"Replacing the ignition switch tumbler (cylinder)","16022","","<p>Recently we started having problems turning my <strong>2000 Sienna</strong>'s key in the switch past the OFF position. I have to wiggle the wheel for some time and play with the key, until it ""catches"" the right position to turn to ACC position. Looking for a solution, I found a video on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMR-a2n05gc"" rel=""nofollow"">Youtube</a> describing how to replace the switch tumbler.</p>

<p>After goofing around for some hour or so, trying to open the dash panels, I was finally able to extract the tumbler out of the switch assembly. I also found a non-OEM part on eBay for $35. Then, I called the local dealer to see if they have it in stock, and to my surprise, after getting the VIN, he quoted ~$240 for an original part. When I told him I found it online for $35, he said that it is b/c my key has the immobilizer chip in it, and he guarantees that the replacement part will not work.</p>

<p>Further investigating, I found out that the chip (transponder) is embedded in the key, but the antenna is in the ring <em>around</em> the cylinder, and not in the part I took out. So, I now know that there are unchipped keys, which are slim, and chipped ones which are ""fat"".</p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is there a difference between the <strong>tumbler</strong> parts of a chipped and unchipped switches? Can it be safely interchanged inside the switch assembly?</p></li>
<li><p>One reference demonstrated how to ignite the car using an unchipped key, while holding an original chipped key just next to the antenna ring (the ring around the keyhole). Does the engine continue working even long after the chipped key removed away from the switch, or is there some repeated ID conformation every couple of minutes?</p></li>
<li><p>Is the orientation of the transponder (the chip) with respect to the antenna critical for successful communications?</p></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update 1:</strong> It happens that when inserted in place, the rear side of the tumbler rotates a small flat piece that is connected to the actual electrical switch. When removed the housing looks like a big empty cylinder with this metal piece sticking up from its far end (think about an 12V accessory (cigarette lighter) socket with a metal blade popping up inside, where the positive 12V contact is placed normally).</p>

<p>In order to remove the tumbler, one has to rotate the key to the ACC position. So, when removed, the flat piece is slightly rotated inside that hollow cylinder. Now, I was able to use pliers to grab and rotate that piece, as if it was the tumbler - and so turn the car on, while holding my transponder key near the removed antenna ring.</p>

<p>The car does turn on and remains on even while the key was removed from the antenna. It kept running until I used the pliers again to rotate the piece back to ACC mode. So, I guess this answers my questions #2 and #3.</p>

<p>I thought about leaving the switch like this and using the pliers method until the replacement tumbler is shipped, to avoid getting stuck with an dis-functioning key switch (which will later prevent me from extracting the tumbler again). Unfortunately, once in ACC, the pliers cannot rotate the metal piece back to OFF position, so the car remains half operational all the time. Eventually, I placed the part back in place and turned off all systems.</p>
","<p>Same problem, fixed it, details below.</p>

<p>Toyota Sienna 2001 XLE. <strong>Issue:</strong> Key doesn't turn. <strong>Problem:</strong> Some of the tumblers in Toyota's ignition lock cylinder are split. These split tumblers don't go down when they should. For vid description, see: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxxwk9l9X9g"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxxwk9l9X9g</a></p>

<p><strong>Possible fix:</strong> Buy a new cylinder. However, if you have chip'd keys (immobilizer feature), this can be really expensive. Also, your door locks won't match otherwise. I've read you need to do this at a dealer and it can cost $500 (I didn't verify this).</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Remove the split tumblers from the cylinder. The cylinder is slightly less secure, but since you still need the correct chip'd key anyway, that's hardly an issue.</p>

<p><strong>What I did:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Disconnect negative battery cable and shield it. This is so you don't accidentally deploy the airbag while messing around.</li>
<li>Remove bottom plastic panel. This was one screw on the bottom right. The rest of the plastic has clips and it just pulls out.</li>
<li>Remove metal metal that is under the plastic panel. This is two screws that are identical to the one from the plastic panel.</li>
<li>Remove black plastic circle thing from around ignition hole. This just snaps out.</li>
<li>Unclip white block connectors for the wires from the ignition system.</li>
<li>Unscrew and remove the black circle with the green light from the chip reader that sits on top of the ignition cylinder.</li>
<li><strong>Insert key and turn to ACC position. Obviously turning the key is the whole problem, but you need to do this. If you can't get it to turn one last time you can't continue.</strong></li>
<li>Under the cylinder is a hole with a pin. Push this pin in and pull your key at the same time (you can only push the pin if the key is at the ACC position). The cylinder will side out. </li>
<li>Remove the metal face plate from the cylinder. There is a pin and two rivets. Bend the faceplate with a screw driver where the pin is. Drill the rivets out. The faceplate will now come off.</li>
<li>Slide the tumbler cylinder out of the metal housing.</li>
<li>Insert your key and observe the offending split tumblers that do not retract. Remove these with pliers. Be sure to take out the springs that sat under those tumblers so they don't fall in one day.</li>
<li>Put everything back together in reverse order.</li>

<p>That's it! No new parts needed.</p>

<p>Can you provide a canonical example(s) of when the check-engine turns off on it's own and another example where the light stays on until manually clearning?</p>
","<p>The light can clear itself. For instance if you leave the gas cap off when refueling, the light will come on and a code will be entered into the computer memory. Once the cap is put back on and a drive cycle occurs where the computer can detect that everything is good, the light will go off. The <em>light</em> will go off, but the code will remain in the computer until cleared (for whatever reason, such as lack of power or being manually cleared by a handheld device).</p>

<p>Obviously, if the issue is something which needs a mechanic's touch, the light will not go off. Mechanical beasts don't cure themselves. Anytime something gets beyond the thresholds set inside the computer, the light goes on. This can be anything from a bad heating element of an O2 sensor to a bad circuit or lack of continuity in a MAP sensor. Each throws a very distinct code which will not shut itself off until the issue is fixed.</p>

<p>How do I use an OBD-II scanner on a vehicle with CAN?</p>
","<p>Ok, before I will answer your specific questions, let's do some introduction on bus systems. It could be that you know parts of these things, but I will start here as people with little or no IT or electronics knowledge should be able to understand this as well.</p>

<h2>Bus Systems</h2>

<p>In electronic systems signals are sent from one chip to another using wires (let's forget about wireless things for a second). The simplest way of doing so is to use one wire per bit of information you like to transmit. One bit of information is simply an answer to a yes/no question like <em>""Are the headlights on?""</em> If the headlights are on, there is a voltage on that wire, say 5 volts. If they are off there are 0 volts on the wire.</p>

<p>Now that's fine for one bit of information. But more data requires more wires. Unfortunately: More wires means more complexity. <strong>A modern car is just a computer with tires on it</strong>, so there are a lot of wires (<em>serveral km or miles</em>) in it. More wires result in more weight and more costs and car manufacturers don't like that. So we need a way to reduce the amount of wires.</p>

<p>The usual way of doing so is to use a <strong>bus system</strong>.</p>

<h3>What is a bus system?</h3>

<p>Think of a bus as a way to <strong>transmit more information using fewer wires</strong>. There are other benefits of bus systems, but I will focus on this aspect.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>We want to switch four lamps on or off.</p>

<h3>Without bus system:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Lamp 1: +5&nbsp;V on Wire1 = Lamp is on; 0&nbsp;V on Wire1 = Lamp is off</li>
<li>Lamp 2: +5&nbsp;V on Wire2 = Lamp is on; 0&nbsp;V on Wire2 = Lamp is off</li>
<li>Lamp 3: ...</li>
<li>Lamp 4: ...</li>
</ul>

<p>It's easy to see; we need one wire per lamp.</p>

<h3>With a bus system:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Lamp 1: +1&nbsp;V on Wire1 (Selector), 0 or +5&nbsp;V on Wire2 for on and off (switch)</li>
<li>Lamp 2: +2&nbsp;V on Wire1 (Selector), 0 or +5&nbsp;V on Wire2 for on and off (switch)</li>
<li>Lamp 3: +3&nbsp;V on Wire1 (Selector), 0 or +5&nbsp;V on Wire2 for on and off (switch)</li>
<li>Lamp 4: +4&nbsp;V on Wire1 (Selector), 0 or +5&nbsp;V on Wire2 for on and off (switch)</li>
</ul>

<p>With this primitive kind of bus system we reduced the amount of wires to <strong>two</strong>. Regardless of the number of lamps we like to control, we only need one wire to tell the other chip which lamp we like to switch and a second wire to tell it wether we like to have the lamp on or off. My example would have limits in the real world as one can't simply raise the voltage to 1000&nbsp;V on Wire 1 to switch a thousand different lamps.</p>

<p>This example shows, why in electronics in general and in cars in particular bus systems are being used. Cars use a number of bus systems that were made especially for them:</p>

<ul>
<li>CAN</li>
<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Interconnect_Network"">LIN</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOST_Bus"">MOST</a></li>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is CAN (controller area network)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CAN is the most important bus system in a car. I won't go into detail on this point, just think of it as a way to transfer big amounts of data using only two wires. You can read more about <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus"">CAN on Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<h2>OBD-II</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>What are the difference between an OBD-II protocol and a CAN setup?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OBD-II is a <strong>higher-level protocol</strong> used for diagnostic purposes. OBD-II can use one of (many) different bus systems to transfer diagnostic data from and to your car. Think of OBD-II as a <strong>language</strong> (English) that you speak and of CAN as the <strong>communication device</strong> (telephone) you use to talk to someone (about your car and its state of health ;).</p>

<p>Many people are referring to OBD (short for on-board diagnosis) or OBD-II as ""standards"". OBD-II is a standard, but it again consists of so many different standards, protocols and bus systems used to communicate that it's difficult to list all of them. I once made an overview graphic, and I will see if I can add that to my answer later.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How to use OBD-II scanner on a vehicle with CAN?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just plug it into the OBD-II port of your car. CAN is one of the transport protocols of the OBD-II specification and should be supported by most OBD-II-Scanners The location of the port can be found using a Google (image) search. Usually the port is <strong>located in reach of the driver</strong>, e.g. <strong>under the dashboard</strong> or hidden in the <strong>center console</strong>.</p>

Over the last couple of days it has developed a problem where when accelerating it will lose all engine power for about 5 seconds (rpms drop and and then regain power with a short burst of acceleration). It feels like it's running out of gas. I already replaced the air filter and fuel filter, those needed to be replaced anyway, but it didn't help.</p>

<ul>
<li>Fuel pressure. If the car feels like you're running out of gas, it might be that the fuel pump isn't supplying enough fuel or there's another problem with the fuel system like a leaking injector. Has the fuel mileage been suffering lately?</li>
<li>Check the ignition components like the distributor rotor and cap if it still has a distributor, leads and spark plugs. Especially the latter if they have more than 10k miles on them, plus they're the cheapest part to change :).</li>
<li>As PetroEkos suggested, check for vacuum leaks</li>
<li>Check the emissions equipment, you might want to change the PCV valve if it hasn't been changed recently.</li>
<li>If it runs rough when warming up and runs a lot better when it's up to operating temperature, I would check if all the ECU temperature sensors are working as expected. If the ECU thinks that the engine is warmer than it actually is, it'll inject less fuel than it needs during warmup.</li>

"What is the Magic ON temperature for Electric Fans?","15586","","<p>I want to wire up my old truck to turn an electric fan ON to keep the radiator cool.</p>

<p>If I set it to 80°C (176°F), the electric fan would always be ON after 6 minutes.</p>

<p>If the truck has a 180°F Thermostat, should I be looking for 185°F before turning on the electric fan?</p>

<p>The answer by Jason was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Part number 91064028 has options for fan turn on and off and with the 170 degree thermostat the hot coolant will enter the radiator at 170 and in many cases may cool the engine to this temperature without the fan running. If you get the on at 185 and off at 165 when the coolant got to 185 the fan would come on to assist and this is what would be recommended.</p>

"Engine hesitates and sometimes stalls after filling gas tank","15544","","<p>On my car (2005 Dodge Grand Caravan) when I fill up my gas tank, almost immediately afterwards pulling out of the gas station my van sputters, misses, hesitates, call it what you will. The past couple of times the engine has actually stalled as well.</p>

<p>This is very short term. After this quick event it is then fine for the rest if the tank of gas.</p>

<p>Any thoughts on what could cause this?? Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Some clarification on the symptoms, after I pull out from the gas state a few seconds down the road it's about a half second sputter/hesitation from the engine.  And then it recovers.  And then another few seconds later, the same hesitation will happen.</p>

<p>This is going from a really empty tank to a full tank.  I always fill it up, and let it go down to almost empty (a few gallons left in the tank when I refill).</p>
","<p>This sound similar to what I have experienced when there is rust or other ""crud"" in the bottom of the gas tank. Letting it get VERY low then filling it will stir up the ""crud"" and allow it to temporarily clog things up until it settles back down.</p>

<p>To confirm if this is whats happening, try filling up before the fuel level drops below half a tank. Do that a few times and see if it improves. By not letting the tank drop below 1/2, you create a buffer that prevents the introduction of new gas from disturbing the ""crud"" that has settled in the bottom of the tank.</p>

"What does it take for a modern muscle car to sound like a classic muscle car?","15531","","<p>To preface, I would grade my exhaust knowledge with a ""B-"".  I know what the major components are and what they do, but I don't know if and when certain exhaust parts became mandated or introduced over time.</p>

<p>I love how a throaty late-60's/early-70's muscle car exhaust sounds.  Gnarly, a bit raspy, yet throaty and with some oomph.  But when I hear most current muscle cars - 90s and on - the exhaust is mostly deep and loud, with little of the raw or explosive sound that the classic cars have.  The classic muscle cars sound very similar to an inboard/outboard boat engine, where the contemporary muscle cars rarely achieve that note.</p>

<p>A few examples to describe what I notice... (site won't let me post more than 2 links, I posted the most representative examples of what I'm describing)</p>

<p>Classic sound</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFWfR9WCWe8&amp;t=1m13s"">1970 Charger - 40 sec</a></p>

<p>Current Sound</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54ewlMQ-yK4&amp;t=1m0s"">2014 Mustang - 20 sec</a></p>

<ul>
<li>I understand straight pipes make it louder</li>
<li>I understand bigger cams stagger the rhythm of the revolutions</li>
</ul>

<p>Is there anything inherent that causes the discrepancy in exhaust note?  Or do modern manufacturers and modern aftermarket performance companies prefer the ""newer"" sound?</p>
","<p>It has very little to do with the exhaust system and much to do with the mechanics of the engine.  All modern muscle cars have aluminium blocks (vs cast iron), round exhaust ports (vs rectangle), and completely different timing set ups than 60s cars have. The firing order makes a big difference because nobody fires 2 in a row on the same side of the engine anymore.  Thus engines have much better balance now and are smoother sounding.  It's also one of the reasons red lines are so much higher.  The thin walled aluminium blocks and heads resonates sound much differently than cast iron did and even things like 6 bolt mains change engine resonance through the block giving you a tighter tinny sound.  Of course just like air blowing over valves in a trumpet the shape of the combustion chambers and round exhaust ports changes the exhaust note too.  In short the only way to get the 60s sound is with a 60s car. </p>

<p>For what it's worth I have tried nearly everything to get my LS1 Miata to sound like a real muscle car! </p>

"How reliable are bubble balancers?","15486","","<p>I'm starting down the DIY-automotive path and was reading about how some people use bubble balancers to balance their own tires at home.  Can anyone speak to the accuracy of these balancers?  Does anyone use them, and if so, how you found them to be precise enough for everyday use?</p>
","<p>Long before the spin balancer was invented all tires were balanced by a bubble balancer.  If done properly, the 4 point static balance is as good and accurate as any other method.</p>

<p>The most effective bubble balance is accomplished on both inner and outer portions of the tire rim.  This is called a 4 point balance, and can be accomplished as fast as any dynamic balance.
To statically balance a tire using a bubble, the outer edge locations are determined by centering the bubble with 2 weights at the outer side of the rim.  Once the weight is determined these 2 locations are marked on both inner and outer sides then the weight used is divided by 2 and the inner side has half of the weight of the outer side.
As an example 2 one ounce weights placed on the outer edge of the tire center the bubble.  These 2 locations are marked with chalk, and the bottom of the tire is also marked so when it is turned over the mark will show where to place the weights on the inside of the rim.  This creates 4 half ounce weights hammered into position, 2 on the inner rim and 2 on the outer rim.</p>

"Is it dangerous to drive with partially torn control arm bushings?","15476","","<p>My 2008 Acura TSX had developed a violent shake when accelerating. Upon a brief inspection, I noticed the control arm/compliance bushings were partially torn (completely at one point, partially at two points).

However, my control arm bushings have started to tear again.</p>

<p>I'm assuming it was the CV's shaking that caused the tearing, so I'm hoping the tearing will not get worse. <strong>I want to know if it's dangerous to drive with a partially torn control arm bushing, or if I should replace it.</strong> </p>
","<p>Its not uncommon for the control arm bushings on many Hondas/ Acuras to expire quickly. It is however a bit dangerous to drive with them if they are starting to wear down or dry rot. They harden when this happens and cause other components on your suspension and sub-frame to fail. The lateral and vertical shaking of your car will cause something to give eventually. It's not something I'd ignore. You'll need a shop press, a bearing puller set and some patience if you do it yourself. </p>

<p>There is a video on youtube of a guy that really neglected his control arm bushings, his car starts to shake very violently in the video and he looses control and hits a tree. The reason was, because he ignored the issue and the wheel bearing sheared loose after months of being wiggled and knocked in ways it wasn't designed to be.</p>

<p>I would just replace it. I know it can be a monetary and physical pain in the butt, but it's worth not having to deal with getting into an accident or not having a car at all. A short answer to this question is, no its not safe; It could last one more drive, or 1 year.</p>

I realize that the TSX is higher up and I can't expect it to handle like an Integra but what can I do to reduce the swaying? Do I replace the front or rear strut bar or something else? </p>
","<p>You are very close to answering your own question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... what can I do to reduce the swaying?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What you're looking for is an upgraded <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sway_bar#Principles"" rel=""nofollow"">sway bar</a>.  This is ""... usually a torsion spring that resists body roll motions.""  This is in contrast to a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strut_bar"" rel=""nofollow"">strut bar</a> ""... designed to reduce ... strut tower flex by tying two parallel strut towers together.""</p>

<p>In general, if your goal is to reduce body roll, one of the cheapest ways to do so is to upgrade the sway bar(s).  Strut tower bars will have a much more limited effect and should usually be considered after upgrading tires, sway bars, struts and springs (i.e., much later).</p>

<p><strong>Caveat:</strong> increasing the roll stiffness will change your under/oversteering biases.  Specifically, a stiffer bar in the front generally increases understeer.  Likewise, a stiffer rear will increase oversteer.  That said, I had a 97 Integra some time back and installed an adjustable rear sway bar.  I adored its steering responsiveness in the summer but also managed to scare myself several times in the winter....</p>

","<p>From my personal experience with this particular subject you have many variables that come into play.
My shop specializes in computer systems on some of the newer vehicles (Mostly Japanese), but we do work on anything given the chance. ECM, PCM, and ECU are generally manufacturer specific. I usually see ECU when referring to Asian vehicle companies. Chrysler likes to use ECM and PCM. Quite a few GM manufacturers use PCM. </p>

<p>If you think about it from the engineers standpoint they can mean different things though. </p>

<p>Engine Control Module would most likely be your control unit dedicated to all electronics/ Sensors dedicated to your engine only. You would probably have additional computers for things like windows, air conditioning, transmission and they all have their names as well. </p>

<p>If your manufacturer uses the term PCM, it will most likely control multiple aspects of your ""Powertrain"". It perhaps could be that it controls the transmission and engine. Maybe even power steering and emissions as well.</p>

<p>I see that PCM and ECU are the two most used terms for the actual engine computers. ECM is generally a ""catch All"" term that can mean quite a few things. I have a few friends that are electrical engineers and they use the term ECM for ""Electronic control module"". Which could literally mean anything driven by a computer. </p>

"Is it OK to not fix a power steering rack leak?","15406","","<p>I have a 97 Honda Accord with 122K miles on it.  Recently, if I drive over bumpy roads, I'll sometimes feel vibrations seemingly from the underside of the car, almost as if something might be loose.  Sometimes I can feel the gas pedal vibrating.</p>

<p>I took the car in to the Honda dealer and they looked at it.  They said that the vibrations were likely caused by a power steering rack leak and a worn tie rod.  On the invoice, it specifically says ""Left front inner tie rod has excessive play and power steering rack is leaking at that point.  Replace power steering rack and exhaust system to start.""</p>

<p>They said that in order to replace the power steering rack and possibly tie rod, they would have to remove the exhaust first.

So I'd have to replace the exhaust too and all of that might cost $3400.</p>

If wheel chocks are not available, you could use a largish stone which could be wedged between the tire and the ground on both sides of the tire. This would be on a tire which is not flat and multiple chocked tires should be utilized. Leave the flat tire on the ground while breaking the lug nuts loose and again while retorquing them. This all depends on the slope of surface in question, though. There will be a point where the slope will be too great to overcome with any of these approaches. In this case, you may have to limp your vehicle to a place where it can be set level. You could also try pointing the vehicle perpendicular to the slope, with the flat tire on the high side.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your tank has to breathe. In order to breathe, your tank must have a vent somewhere that will relieve both vacuum and pressure. Gasoline expands in volume as it warms up and shrinks in volume as it cools down. The fuel level of your tank changes throughout the day, even if you are not driving it.</p>
  
  <p>You cannot put fuel into your tank, unless you can get the air out...and you cannot withdraw fuel from your tank unless you can let air in.</p>
  
  <p>Up through the 1960's, most vehicles used vented gas caps.  This is simply a gas cap with a hole in it. Unfortunately, this hole would allow the fuel to splash out when accelerating or turning a corner.</p>

<p>This was basically brought about due to emissions. The fuel tank is a closed system on cars since 1996 (for the most part). The valve allows for the equalization of air pressure.</p>

I drove it throughout the summer and it wasn't until the winter that I noticed that it was taking a great deal of time for the car to warm up (something you notice quite quickly in northern Wisconsin). It was then I realized the engine cooling fans where constantly running. Just to make sure there was nothing else up, I double checked the radiator and engine coolant hoses and found no leaks and the levels were all normal. </p>

<p>My question is, besides just running cooler, are there any other things that I need to be concerned about with the fans running constantly?</p>
","<p>You may have two problems.</p>

<p>Even with the cooling fans running all of the time, the engine thermostat should force the engine to warm up at a normal speed. The thermostat will regulate the coolant to the radiator/fans if it is working properly.</p>

<p>It can be normal for the cooling fans to run constantly under certain conditions. If the car is hot enough, they may be barely keeping up with demand and stay on.  Also, most cars will run the fans at a high speed if the A/C is turned on. However, when you first start up a stone cold car with the A/C off, they should not be running. </p>

<p>If they are, the ECU is commanding them on falsely (bad temp sensor or it thinks the missing A/C compressor is ""on"") or the relay may be stuck closed. Usually you can find another relay of the same type in your fuse box and switch them to see what happens.

"OHV vs. OHC: which is faster in speed, horse power?","15003","","<p>What are the main differences in OHC and OHV engine designs, and which is faster or more powerful? Also, which is more reliable?</p>
","<p>OHC refers to overhead camshaft and OHV refers to overhead valve, two different configurations in engine design.</p>

<p>The key performance differences are described briefly in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overhead_camshaft"">this Wikipedia article</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The fundamental reason for the OHC valvetrain is that it offers an
  increase in the engines' ability to exchange induction and exhaust
  gasses. (This exchange is sometimes known as 'engine breathing'.)
  Another performance advantage is gained as a result of the better
  optimised port configurations made possible with overhead camshaft
  designs. With no intrusive pushrods, the overhead camshaft cylinder
  head design can use straighter ports of more advantageous
  crossection and length. The OHC design allows for higher engine
  speeds, which in turn will increase power output for a given
  torque.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So OHC can provide greater power. This does not necessarily relate directly to speed, but a reasonable assumption is that yes, you would expect it to be faster.</p>

<p>DOHC, or dual overhead camshaft, allows even freer gas flow so can provide even higher power output.</p>

<p>OHC is easier to maintain, as more components tend to be external to the engine block, so they can be adjusted and maintained, as well as checked for problems.</p>

<p>These days there are very few OHV engines anyway.</p>

"How does the coolant disappear?","14843","","<p>If there is no leak? So how does the coolant level decreases as time passes? Does it get pressurized so it's level decreases? Or what happens? Since it keeps circulating to the engine and coming back so why do we have to add some coolant every year or something, even if it evaporates inside it will again condensate after the engine is off and cooled</p>
","<p>There are only four places (in general) coolant can go missing:</p>

<ul>
<li>Out an external leak and onto the ground</li>
<li>Out through the tail pipe getting burnt (turned into steam) because of an internal leak</li>
<li>Into the oil through an internal leak</li>
<li>A very small amount may evaporate from the system if it's not a closed system (ie: no overflow reservoir) ... this really isn't a big deal, just add a small amount to make up the difference. (note: this fourth one was added as an edit)</li>
</ul>

<p>Since coolant is a liquid, it does not compress, even if pressurized.</p>

<p>The first is pretty obvious as you can find it on the ground, usually. A leak may not occur until the system is fully pressurized, though (ie: after the entire system is fully heated). You would usually see this going on due to steam escaping the system.</p>

<p>The second is not as easy to tell, especially if it's a small leak. You could have a very small leak in the head gasket, which would go out through the exhaust. You would probably not see this going on, as when gasoline is burned, it creates a large amount of steam as well. You may be able to smell a sweet smell from the exhaust.</p>

<p>The third way you may or may not see as well, depending on the amount of coolant loss. If it is just a very small amount, it will mix in with the oil and get evaporated. If it's a larger amount, it will turn the oil to look like chocolate milk.</p>

<p>If you have just a small amount of coolant missing over time, a radiator stop leak (if used correctly) will find and stop the leak without issue.</p>

","<p>The reason that an automatic doesn't stall out while ""in gear"" and at a stop, while a manual transmission does, is that automatic transmissions use a hydraulic torque converter to connect the engine to the transmission, while manual transmissions use a friction clutch.

<p>A torque converter uses fluid to transfer the power, and so it can ""slip,"" effectively disengaging the engine from the drive wheels at low speeds. When you come to a complete stop in an automatic transmission car, the torque converter starts slipping, allowing the engine to keep turning even though the wheels have stopped. </p>

<p>The only way to get the friction clutch of a manual transmission to slip is to depress the clutch pedal. If you come to a stop in a manual transmission car without depressing the clutch pedal, the engine stops turning when the wheels stop turning, and the car stalls.</p>

<p>The question is, what happens if the clutch release bearing completely fails? Will there be collateral damage to anything else or will I just find myself unable to shift?</p>
","<p>The noise you describe is a VERY common issue with the transmission in the model of RX-7 you are driving. As a matter of fact, my current RX-7 (1991, 220k miles) has this exact same issue.</p>

The only true fix for it is a disassembly of the manual transmission itself, and replacement of the affected bearing.</p>

<p>Essentially, all you can really do between now and eventually replacing that bearing is to keep the gearbox oil level full and clean. Some suggest trying different oils (e.g. Royal Purple) but that would only (if anything) reduce noise, and is not really addressing or repairing the issue. The good news is, it's not typically an issue that will cause you to ""get stuck somewhere"" unless it gets bad enough for the bearing to completely fail (unlikely as long as you keep that fluid clean and full!).

<p>The problem is that my truck (2000 Ford Ranger, V6 4.0) has lost a lot of power and so acceleration is slow, my maximum speed is around 55-65 miles per hour, and the gas consumption is high. Here are the codes it's throwing:</p>

I've cleaned the throttle body and MAF to no avail. I put a hose in my ear and put it at various junctions along the air intake system, but there's always a fan running right there, making it very difficult for me to tell what's a leak and what's some airflow from that fan, but one thing I did notice is that I can hear some hissing at both ends of the large, ribbed hose that connects the throttle body to the mass air flow sensor (this is a picture I found and drew on, not one I took):</p>

But for whatever reason that did not change the performance of the truck at all, so I'm still very much looking for any recommendations for possibilities for why I'm losing power, diagnostic tests I can run at home and how to just make this truck run for 1-2 weeks.</p>

<p>As a follow-on to that last update, 2 of the codes have now disappeared, I now only have:</p>

<ul>
<li>P1121: Throttle position sensor inconsitent with MAF sensor</li>
<li>P0174: System Too Lean (Bank 2)</li>
<li>P0351: Ignition Coil A Primary/Secondary Circuit Malfunction</li>
<li>P0141: O2 Sensor Heater Circuit Malfunction (Bank 1, Sensor 2).</li>
</ul>

<p>So apparently fixing the one vacuum leak did solve one lean condition, but not both.</p>

<p><strong>Update 3</strong>: I checked the voltage at the grey wire on the throttle position sensor,it smoothly varied from 0.6 V (closed throttle - idle position) to 0.5 V (wide open throttle) as a function of the throttle position. I pulled it off the truck and measured the resistance between I think pins 1 and 2 and it varied from 3 kOhms (closed) to 0 Ohms, smoothly. From what I saw in other posts people were saying it should vary from 1 V to 5 V, so that's suspicious, but I'm not convinced it's the problem.</p>

<p><strong>Final Update</strong>: Ok, so the day before I was scheduled to drop the truck off at the mechanic, I was driving home and was going to help someone move something on the way home (figured an extra 5 or so miles wouldn't hurt if I was already driving 40), but when I got to Sears (thank goodness I did this!), I got out of the truck and smelled radiator fluid burning - a smell I wish I were less familiar with. I was hoping it was someone else, but when I looked under the car it looked like my truck was ready to give birth. I went and got a new bottle of radiator fluid and took a look under the hood to discover that the coolant fan was now MISSING, with the fan clutch all scored up (presumably from the fan wobbling to and fro). I filled up the reservoir and drove the last few miles home (stopping only at Wal-mart to get more radiator fluid and some stop-leak, which I did not put in the radiator just yet) with the heat blasting. It was only sometimes hot, which really bothered me as I think it means the pump wasn't giving good circulation.</p>

<p>I make it home with minimal fluid loss and in the morning I make it OK to the mechanic, tell them all the problems and they look at me like I'm one of the patients on House - luckily they're actually very great mechanics and highly reviewed/recommended. They end up having to replace not only the fan but the radiator and the water pump - all leaking water profusely (as an aside, it's clear that this was not an upsell, as the guy was practically trying to convince me that this was work I could do myself rather than pay him to do it). Anyway, once that was all replaced, the power problems all mysteriously disappeared. The mechanic couldn't explain it, and I can't explain it. I haven't had time to pull the codes again, but the truck runs fine, so potentially this was some secondary effect of something in the cooling system. I would have <em>never</em> guessed that. </p>

<p>Also, I could never find even an OEM version of that intake hose running from the throttle body to the MAFS, so I ended up putting a bit of hose patch tape over the hole and covering the whole thing with quick-setting JB-weld and I've had zero problems since. Seems like it may work as a permanent fix (at least until I'm at a salvage yard one day and see the right part just sitting there).</p>

<p>Hopefully something I've done along the way will help someone later.</p>
","<p>When discussing the <strong>Throttle Position Sensor</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>You understand it's function electrically on a 5v reference.</li>
<li>If you were to take the sensor off and look at the side that goes against the throttle body then you would notice the coil. The inductive loop works as follows. 
<ul>
<li>When the butterfly of the throttle body opens (up until wide open throttle) voltage increases [as close to reference voltage value as possible (usually ~4.7v)]</li>
<li>As the butterfly closes resistance is added to the circuit and in turn voltage will drop as close to 0v as it can safely [usually ~0.3v]</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Failed Sensor Symptoms</strong></p>

<p>Conditions when the sensor fails this is what happeneds electronically.</p>

<ol>
<li>Will not be able to set ""base timing""</li>
<li>Surging will occur at Idle giving the same(ish) feel as a larger vacuum leak.</li>
<li>Hesitation on acceleration</li>
<li>Possible stalling.</li>
</ol>

<p>If the systems can't ""plant its feet"" due to the fact that it cannot confirm throttle positionAp, and since throttle position is a very important factor this is where you will see faults in a variety of places. Not being able to see the throttle will make it impossible to set proper mixture, and seeing that the MAF &amp; TPS are obviously not seeing ""eye to eye"" there's no way to confirm air volume. And with all that there's not a chance the exhaust reading will be correct. </p>

<p>According to your last update .1v is what you're movement is. Something is wrong here. The sensor is either installde incorrectly or it's junk. Seeing that it's rest position [idle] is in fact .5v then I'm going to saw it's not installed correctly.</p>

"Is Anti-Seize a lubricant, abrasive, or both?","14534","","<p>I'll flesh my personal bias at the outset - being a heavy diesel mechanic for a time, and mechanically inclined my entire life, I use Anti-Seize wherever I can. If it has threads and it's not part of a rotational mass like a driveshaft, clutch, or hub, I use it. It's served me very well over the years. Specifically, I usually skip the copper and use the slightly more expensive nickel anti-seize to avoid reactions with certain metals and increased temperature limits.</p>

<p>Recently, I've heard an (as of yet unsubstantiated) claim that Anti-Seize is an abrasive because of the metal content on <a href=""https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/9015/oil-anti-seize-on-outside-of-nipple-when-building-a-wheel/9017"">this bicycles.SE question</a> and then after searching <a href=""http://www.ar15.com/archive/topic.html?b=3&amp;f=7&amp;t=470120"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>. If this has any merit, it changes my understanding of the substance in a fundamental way. </p>

<p>Now there IS good reason to think of it as a lubricant, starting with the title, 'Anti Seize <strong>Lubricant</strong>', one of the primary ingredients being grease and graphite (graphite being a solid lubricant that shears easily), <a href=""http://tds.loctite.com/tds5/docs/NICASL-EN.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the datasheet</a>, which describes it as such. It does warn:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>CAUTION</strong>:  LOCTITE Nickel Anti-Seize Lubricant is not a high-speed load carrying lubricant and should not be used on ball or roller bearings, or on parts where lubrication is critical.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This tells me yes, it's a lubricant, but not for specific lubrication issues. The only thing I can find to substantiate the abrasive claim is <a href=""http://www.antiseize.com/ecatpgs/ecatpg05.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this datasheet</a> under the <em>Moly Plate</em> section, where is states this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Does not form a carbon abrasive after high-temp exposure</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Could it be the case that the people who mention the abrasive qualities are those who have passed the heat rating of their anti-seize? This is a possiblity, since most people use the copper type which is only rated for 550&deg;F, where I consistently use the nickel type rated for 2,400&deg;F.</p>
","<p><strong>This is an educated assumption...</strong><br>
In geology a mineral's hardness is measured according to different scales. A common one is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohs_scale_of_mineral_hardness"" rel=""nofollow"">Mohs scale of hardness</a>, which ranks minerals from softest (talc) to hardest (diamond). The only way a mineral can scratch the other, is for the mohs hardness value to be higher. Now, according to the link:</p>

<ul>
<li>Graphite - 1.5</li>
<li>Copper - 3</li>
<li>Iron, Nickel - 4</li>
<li>Platinum, Steel - 4-4.5</li>
</ul>

<p>Assuming parts manufacturers are aware of this, anti-seize should not have an adverse effect on heavy equipment, automobiles, and the likes. This assumption assumes the alloys used in all these parts are harder than the metals used in anti-seize.</p>

"Is it safe to downsize from 205/55r16 to 195/65r15 for winter tires?","14522","","<p>I own a Hyundai Elantra GT SEL 2014 which is currently equipped with stock Hankooks 205/55r16.  I am looking to buy a set of winter tires and I was originally looking at 16"" tires but a friend suggested I get 15"" instead. From what I can see the manufacturer does not forbid it (should not void the warranty) and there seems to be people indeed doing it according to a quick Google search. Considering there is almost 200$ difference between the 16 and 15 for the set of tires I am considering to buy,  is there any major drawback ?</p>

<p>I am an inexperienced, cautious driver. I will drive mostly in the city and may have to do highway from time to time. I'm told the roads are mostly icy (vs full of snow). I was considering Michelin Xi3</p>
","<p>There are several things you need to be aware of when doing this. </p>

<p>First, you'll incur the cost of getting new rims (which I'm sure you already realize). This is actually pretty common when fitting snow tires, though. Having a second set of cheaper rims (steel is cheaper than alloy) you can change out yourself versus having to take them to the shop to get done is a large cost savings, not only in money, but time as well (do them at home at your convenience). </p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> When you take one set of tires off, ensure you mark them for placement on the vehicle. Tires should always rotate the same direction or wear will increase tremendously. If you just write on the tread area with some chalk the position of the tire when it comes off the car, you can put it right back where you got it without issue. (ie: DF=Driver's Front; DR=Right Rear; PF=Passenger's Front; PR=Passenger's Rear)</p>

<p>Secondly, you need to see whether your car can actually fit smaller rims. It is quite common for there to be interference between the brake rotor and the smaller rim. A side consideration when getting your new rims is that you need to ensure you have the correct offset. Not just any rims will do, they must stick out the correct (enough) distance or the new rim will interfere with body and brakes. There is a lot to put into consideration here. You will also need to make sure the size of the tire will fit on the rim (tire width and what it needs to go onto). </p>

<p>Thirdly, when considering a snow tire, make sure the rolling distance or ""rotations per mile"" (RPM) is the same or nearly the same between the two tires. Having a huge difference between the two tires will cause your speedometer calibration to be off. It will also affect how the vehicle behaves (ie: a taller tire will require more torque to get a vehicle rolling and stopped; a shorter tire will cause worse gas mileage on the highway because the engine has to rev higher to achieve the same ground speed.) Most major online tire stores (like <a href=""http://www.tirerack.com"" rel=""noreferrer"">tirerack.com</a>) have this or at least the diameter of the tire. You can compare the two and make a decision from that. </p>

<p>With all that said, you shouldn't have an issue with running the smaller tire, especially considering the small amount of difference there is between the two. </p>

","<p>Yes, at least half of the exhaust is coming straight out of that gap without passing through the muffler.  As you've noted, this leads to an increase in noise (or music, depending on your taste).</p>

<p>To my eye, that looks like a hassle to fix on your own.  There appears to be the rusted remnants of two bolts holding the Y-pipe to the passenger side muffler and perhaps the merest wisp of a gasket remaining.  I suspect that you're going to have to cut and drill out those old rusted bolts just to disengage the two pipes.  A repair will either require those old bolts out, clear holes, clean mating surfaces, a new gasket, new bolts and lots of anti-seize.  None of that is expensive but it's something of a drag.</p>

<p>If you've been thinking about an aftermarket exhaust system, this might be a good time to make a purchase.  I'd suggest looking for a system that includes both pipes leading to the mufflers and the Y-pipe leading back from the catalytic converter.</p>

"How exactly does running fuel-lean increase the temperature of ignition?","14363","","<p>I learned <a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/a/25330/14003"">in this question</a> that running an engine fuel-lean will increase the temperature of ignition, among other things such as causing problems with the catalytic converter. I have no idea how or why.</p>

<p><strong><em>How and why exactly does running fuel lean (or oxygen rich) increase the temperature of ignition?</em></strong></p>
","<p>You have a qualitative description of what happens, but let's break it down to a smaller scale. When we talk about ""temperature"" of something, we are really talking about how fast the molecules are moving around and bouncing off each other. ""Temperature"" is really ""kinetic energy"". And it turns out that there are other types of energy besides moving around in space -- molecules can rotate, they can vibrate, and their electrons can get excited and move around relative to the nucleus. Each of these energies can also be a ""temperature"", so you can have translational temperature (what we normally think of), but you can have rotational temperature, vibrational temperature, and electronic temperatures. </p>

<p>Molecules exchange energy with one another by colliding into each other. When they do this, they also distribute the energy between them. How often they collide determines how quickly the energy becomes uniform, and this defines how quickly they reach what is called equilibrium. When all of the different temperatures are the same, the state is in equilibrium and we don't need to worry about keeping track of all of the different types of temperature. For most of the processes that would occur in an engine, there is more than enough time to reach equilibrium and so we don't need to worry too much about non-equilibrium effects.</p>

<p>Now, in chemical reactions, molecules break apart and form new ones. If the new ones have less energy, the difference in energy is released as heat. If the new ones have more energy, the reaction requires adding energy to make it happen. Obviously engines get hot, so the reactions in them release energy and we harness that energy to move the vehicle. </p>

<p>So, molecules break apart. And they break apart when they start vibrating so hard that the bonds between the atoms cannot hold them together anything. The only way to make the molecule vibrate is to have another molecule collide with it, with enough energy and an efficient enough transfer of energy to start the vibrations. And the energy has to be high enough that the vibration makes the molecules fall apart. </p>

<p>By changing the amount of fuel in the mixture, you are changing the types of collisions that can occur. And it's not exactly straight forward, but some molecules are better at exchanging energy with others. To make the fuel molecule fall apart, they need to collide with other fuel molecules with some energy of with other oxygen molecules with more energy. If you add more than the usual amount of oxygen (run lean), you also need to make that oxygen hotter so the molecules have more energy when they collide and can make the fuel vibrate hard enough to fall apart. Conversely, if you run fuel-rich, you have more fuel molecules that can collide with one another and fall apart, but fewer oxygen molecules for them to combine with and give off heat. This (and some other effects) makes the final flame temperature lower.</p>

<hr>

<p>Based on some extended conversation on the question, let's put this all back into the context of an engine. For a direct-injection gas engine, the air is sucked into the cylinder, the piston compresses it, and then fuel is sprayed into the cylinder. A spark plug then triggers a spark in the chamber. This deposition of electrons gets the fuel-air mixture molecules all excited -- it actually ionizes the air (strips off electrons from the molecules) and this all adds a bunch of energy to the molecules. This energy is the initial energy required to start the combustion. </p>

<p>For a fuel-lean condition, I said it takes more energy to start the reaction and I phrased it in terms of a higher ignition temperature. The ignition temperature comes from that spark plug (for a cold engine -- hot engines will also contribute heat from the cylinders themselves). For normal operating conditions, spark plugs provide more than enough energy to ignite. As the operating condition gets leaner, the spark plug provides the same amount of energy -- but it is still enough energy to ignite. Eventually, for lean enough conditions, it won't be enough energy. This is a <strong>lean misfire</strong>. </p>

<p>Diesel engines work differently. For sake of argument, let's stick with a direct injection again. The cylinder fills with air, the piston compresses it, and the fuel is injected. There is no spark to initiate the reaction though. Diesel engines rely solely on creating high enough pressures to ignite the mixture. High pressure means high density and that means more collisions to spread the energy around (molecules don't need to go as far to hit one another). At any rate, the same ideas apply. In lean conditions, it would require a higher pressure to ignite. At ideal conditions, the engine compresses more than is exactly required, so when it runs fuel-lean, it still has enough compression to ignite. If you go so lean that the compression isn't high enough anymore, you will again get a <strong>lean misfire</strong>. Glow plugs can help all this by heating the cylinders and helping to add heat to the mixture and get the reactions going. </p>

<p>In either engine, once they have been running for awhile, the cylinder walls heat up and it requires less input (from sparks or from compression) to make the reaction occur. But for cold engines, it needs that initial energy deposition to get the reactions moving along. Many ECU's are set to burn fuel-rich when the engine is just starting because it is easier to ignite; as they heat up, the mixture becomes more lean and reduces emissions and fuel consumption. You may be familiar with manual chokes on things like lawn mowers -- the choke is what changes the fuel-air mixture and to get the motor started, you have to set the choke to be fuel-rich.</p>

<hr>

<p>For those interested, based on the discussion we had in the various comment threads, I went ahead and gave a concrete example of how/why temperature can increase when the flame is fuel-lean. The conversation in chat is <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/340/conversation/lean-combustion-clarification"">bookmarked here</a>.</p>

<li>Second, it was a place like Sears/Midas, this place offers a wider
range of services/repairs. I believe these places are more worthy of
your trust, as the chain is large and customer service is important
as even one bad report can really damage their image. Again, they

"Mercedes start/stop system doesn't always kick in","14213","","<p>We're the (humbled) owners of a 2011 Class B Mercedes with an inbuilt ECO start/stop system. As far as I understand this is how it's supposed to work:</p>

<li>Press the brake pedal <em>all the way</em>.</li>
<li>Motor turns ""off"".</li>
<li>Shift into first gear.</li>

<p>The salesman remarked that the main problem people have with this system is they don't actually press the pedal all the way to the metal. However, we're experiencing that while this system just works at times, it also just doesn't work at other times. More specifically, it tends to work when leaving home and <em>not</em> to work in return trips.</p>

<p>The operating manual is in German since this is a used car, so I'm kind of at a loss. What's going on here?</p>
","<p>There are other factors that affect the start stop feature. I am not sure on that exact model but generally the following things will keep the car engine from shutting off:</p>

<ul>
<li>Coolant Temp too high, or too low</li>
<li>The engine has not ran for at least two minutes</li>
<li>The AC is on and not in the economy mode</li>
<li>Low Vacuum</li>
<li>Battery charge low</li>
<li>High current draw on the 12 volt system (IE defogger, defroster, and
windshield wipers all on at the same time)</li>
</ul>

<p>If one of the above conditions is met it does not allow the start stop feature to work.</p>

"Third brake light (LED) test","14148","","<p>I have a 2008 Honda Civic and the 3rd brake light is having an issue. It seems in the morning (first cold start) it works when I depress the brake (I can see it light up the rear window). But after a few pumps, the light stops working. It is an LED array and I always thought that those should last way longer than regular bulbs, as in fact, I have not even replaced any tail lights just having an issue with this 3rd break light.</p>

<li><p>Unplug the LED array. (Pictures to come) Video of removal process <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLS3CQykji8&amp;noredirect=1"">here on youtube</a></p></li>
<li><p>Remove the rear plastic shroud(with a few upward slaps) by folding down the rear seats and slap the edge of the shroud up. Slide the shroud forward as there are tabs that the part nearest the window slide into(and is then held in by the clips you released by ""slapping up"").</p></li>
<li>Unscrew the LED mount and the round plastic speaker rim(the rim looks to be like a gasket, not a part of the speaker.)</li>
<li>remove the LED array from the rear shroud. I found my issue by plugging in the light and tapping around. It would flicker so I knew something was loose. After pressing the neg terminal solder spot, I could see that although it looked solid, it was not.</li>
<li>Heated up the solder iron, tapped a little solder on there and tested. The LEDs worked! Keeping the pedal depressed, I simulated bumps and the like while it was plugged in, no flicker, all solid.</li>

<p>I'm asking because I was discussing about an accident where a car crashed into a full-grown brown bear. Is it realistic under normal circumstances that the car could catch fire?</p>
","<p>Three things are required, fuel, oxygen, and a source of ignition. Since around 1978 when the burning Pinto issue appeared, manufacturers have tried to design vehicles that limit the three from occuring together. Cars bursting into flames after an accident is a pretty rare event. According to these stats I got from the NFPA website, only 3% of vehicle fires were the result of a collision or rollover. Almost half (49%) were the result of mechanical failure, leaks, or worn out parts. Electrical issues caused 23% of the fires. So looking at all the data in a well maintained vehicle it is possible but not likely.</p>

"Can I use EP 80W/90 oil instead of EP90 oil?","14045","","<p>I have a Belle MiniMix 150 110V Electric Cement Mixer  the documentation says to use a EP90 oil in the gear box, but these days it seems that most outlets only sells EP80/90 oil.</p>

<p>What is the difference and does it matter?</p>

<p>(I am asking on a mechanics.stackexchange as I need advice for people that understand gear boxes and oils.)</p>
","<p>80W90 is a multiviscosity version of the single-viscosity 90 gear oil; it's the same concept as 10W30 motor oil being the multiviscosity version of single-viscosity 30-weight motor oil. The ""W"" is a ""winter"" rating, meaning that the oil in question is designed to be usable in winter months in cold climates.</p>

<p>80W90 oil is perfectly satisfactory for your purposes in a cement mixer - it can be either GL4 (with very little molybdenum disulfide) or GL5 (with lots of moly-d)... for a cement mixer I'd recommend using the GL5 because you have no brass synchro components for the moly-d to attack. GL4 is for older manual transmissions that can't tolerate moly-d because they contain brass. For gearboxes that can use it, moly-d adds extra protection against wear, especially in cases where regular maintenance is unlikely.</p>

"How does a clutch work?","14040","","<p>I understand how a clutch can separate the flywheel from the clutch disk so that power is disconnected from the engine.</p>

<p>When that happens, does the input shaft (along with the countershaft) stop immediately? </p>

<p>If they are moving, they should have some rotational energy, how is all the energy lost in one second and it stops?</p>
","<p>A basic clutch is made up of three major parts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Flywheel</li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vZ4Ry.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<ul>
<li>Friction disk</li>

<li>Pressure plate</li>

<p>(<strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> These three pieces do not actually go together. I'm using the pictures for illustrative purposes.)</p>

<p>The flywheel is attached to the back of the engine. The pressure plate is attached to the flywheel. Sandwiched in between the two is the friction disk. The friction works a lot like brake pads, in that it grips the flywheel/pressure plate on either side through, what else, friction.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/EmjH2.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The splined input shaft of the transmission is placed through the friction disk and rides on a pilot bearing at the center of the flywheel. When you press the clutch pedal, the the throwout bearing is pushed against the clutch fingers, which pulls the plate away from the flywheel. When the pressure plate is pulled away, it allows for enough space between the to for a decoupling and the friction disk is allowed to spin freely. This disconnects the power output of the engine from going to the transmission. When you release the clutch pedal, the plate moves back towards the flywheel, recapturing the friction disk and power is restored to the transmission.</p>

<p>Please not, it's not that the input shaft <em>stops immediately</em> when the clutch is disengaged. It's just that each entity (engine and transmission) are allowed to operate independently of each other at that point. This gives you time to change gears or prepare for a stop.</p>

"Car not starting: How likely that it's the fuel pump?","13983","","<p>So I have a 1987 Hyundai Pony that was a little stubborn starting last time, but did run in the end. Then it sat for a couple of weeks. It's kind of cold (but not that cold—I'm in Vancouver). Now nothing seems to make it want to start. There's plenty of gas in the tank, the starter motor is cranking fine, it seems to be sparking fine (I pulled one plug out to check, didn't look at the other three though).</p>

<p>I remember someone telling me that when the ignition is first turned on you should be able to hear a hum of the fuel pump running for a few seconds. I don't hear anything like that. But how likely is it that a fuel pump problem would arise from the car just sitting for a couple of weeks? I don't really want to replace the thing if that's not the problem. Is checking the fuel line pressure a straightforward thing?</p>

<p>Thanks very much for any ideas!</p>
","<p>I fixed a 1998 Ford Contour that wouldn't start after sitting for a while in cold weather.  The problem was a corroded ground connector in the wiring at the fuel pump.  A couple years later, it was left sitting again, and sure enough, it wouldn't start.  Same problem, same fix.  It can happen, though I'm not sure I would have believed it if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes.  </p>

<p>You should be able to hear the fuel pump briefly after turning the ignition key to the accessory position.  If you don't, the first thing to check is the fuel pump relay.  The location should be in your owners manual, it's probably in a box in the engine compartment with some fuses and other relays.  Swap the relay with a known good good one.  You might be able to feel the relay engage if you have your finger on it when it gets power (don't start the engine, just turn the key to the accessory position).</p>

<p>Once you've ruled out the relay, it's probably time to check for fuel pressure.  If you can get your hands on a fuel pressure test gauge, check it at the fuel rail under the hood, there should be a test port.  You can rent the gauge from some auto parts stores.  This is the ""least likely to start a fire"" method of checking the fuel pressure, and the only one I'd recommend.  </p>

<p>If the pressure is low, the pump may have one foot in the grave, and if it's zip, you've got a dead pump or a problem with the wiring between the relay and the pump.  I suppose you could have a clogged fuel filter too, that's worth checking, just be careful when disconnecting the fuel lines.  Since your vehicle hasn't been running, you don't have to worry about hot exhaust components, but disconnect the battery for the sake of safety and be careful not to generate any sparks.  Also, be prepared to deal with a bit of spilled gasoline (and don't catch it in the face).  Might as well change the filter while you're down there.</p>

<p>If the fuel pressure is good (you need to find out what the expected value is), your problem is not the fuel pump.  If you're getting spark and fuel but it still won't start, it might be time to check the timing.  </p>

<p>I've got a 2005 Chrysler Sebring, and I've noticed just today that <strong>when I put the ignition into whatever mode it is that lets me control the power windows and listen to the radio without actually turning on the motor</strong> (I turn the key slightly forward -- I'm assuming this is not the accessory mode as when I turn the key backward, the radio comes on but the power windows do not...) <strong>the check engine and oil pressure lights come on and stay on. However, when I turn the engine on, the lights go off.</strong> All other diagnostic lights are off before turning on the engine. It is only these two that stay on until I turn on the engine.</p>

<p>I checked the oil level just to see if it may be off, and I can't be 100% sure of the actual oil level due to my driveway being not being properly level... but it looked to be just slightly down.</p>

<p>Is this expected to happen given that the engine is off? Do the diagnostics only work when the engine is running?</p>
","<p>This is normal behavior - When the engine is not running, there is no oil pressure, so when the ignition is turned on, that light will be on. As Larry says, this functions as a bulb test so that you know that it is working. When you start the engine, the oil is pumped round, the pressure goes up and the light goes out.</p>

How come V4 never became more used in modern automotive engineering?</p>
","<p>One of the most influential reason as to why the V4 didnt take off is the ROI(return on investment) . The reason as to why we have the <strong>V configuration</strong> is to save space , High performance cars have V configuration since they have upwards of 6 to 8 cylinders and putting them in a straight configuration will eat up a lot of space thus the V.</p>

<ul>
<li>In the V4 that advantage is not there since the size
difference is very minute.</li>
<li>The V4 configuration is more expensive to produce you need 2 cylinder blocks,so on and so forth.</li>
<li>Inline cylinders are much much much more refined than V engines and since most 4 cylinder cars are family everyday cars refinements sits on top of requirement.</li>
<li>V4 engines are harder to maintain since they have complex builds and harder to reach for components.</li>

<p>Is to correct to say that avoiding breaker bars and using an impact wrench instead prevents damage to nuts or bolts?</p>

<p>Is it correct to say that over-torquing lug nuts with an impact gun is fine as long as we open them with impact gun rather than a breaker bar?</p>

<p><strong><em>Uodate 1:</em></strong></p>

<p>I understand and completely agree that a torque wrench is the best approach. However, that is not the context of this question. So we should move from the ideal world to real world where most mechanic shops use impact gun. When we need to open to open an over-torqued lug nut, I can think of 3 options to handle the situation:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Option 1: use a breaker bar.</strong> Well that broke my lug stud :(</li>
<li><strong>Option 2: Use an impact gun to open the lug nut</strong>. My mechanic claims that it always works for him without breaking the stud. He suggested that I should have used this option.</li>
<li><strong>Option 3: use a lubricant such as W40.</strong> Many people don’t like the idea since it changes the torque spec of the lug nuts</li>
</ul>

<p>The question is which of the above option should I consider or is there a better option?</p>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong></p>

<p>I 100% agree that a torque wrench should be used in the 1st place. However, when we end up with an over tighten nut, a breaker bar can cause more damage compare to a similar rotational force created by a four-way or torque gun. It was a mystery to me how come my mechanic never ended up breaking my lug studs, and I broke 4 of them at the 1st try!! He always uses a torque gun, and I used a breaker bar.</p>

<p><strong><em>Once again, I 100% agree that a torque wrench should have been used in the 1st place. Can't emphasise it enough</em></strong> </p>

<p>It costed me $160 to earn this experience, I hope this post save someone else's lug studs :) It is possible to find a fine corded impact wrench for $40, which is fine for home use. I got this one: <a href=""http://www.homedepot.ca/product/18-volt-one-1-2-in-cordless-3-speed-impact-wrench-tool-only/919361"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.homedepot.ca/product/18-volt-one-1-2-in-cordless-3-speed-impact-wrench-tool-only/919361</a> here is a demo video: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvvDYHZ-GeM"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvvDYHZ-GeM</a> </p>
","<p>I can see where your mechanic is coming from. The reason being that, although like Steve Cross notes, the impact wrench applies a lot of force suddenly, it applies the force in an evenly rotational direction. ANY wiggle in the socket (Which there will always be or you wouldn't be able to get it on the nut) and the breaker bar will be putting lateral force along with the rotational force. That will increase chances of breaking the stud. This is why steveverrill recommends to hold the nut end when using a breaker bar, although I'm not sure if that would do much good with so much leverage. </p>

<p>I don't have an impact wrench, and having broken a few studs using a bar or the tire tool that comes with the car, now I always use a four-way to remove lug nuts. It's not as good as an impact wrench but the upward force on one side helps balance the downward force on the other. I've never broken a stud with a four-way. (I have, though, broken a four-way, be careful.) </p>

<p>I was at a shop once and their impact wrench wouldn't budge the nut, so the mechanic said he couldn't change my tire. I asked him about a breaker bar. He said he had one but he couldn't use it because the shop would be liable for a broken stud - which is messed up because it was the same shop that put those nuts on in the first place. He told me if I wanted, I could back it out the door and do it myself, which I did successfully. </p>

"Intermittently fluctuating/non-functioning speedometer in Volvo 940. Possible causes?","13690","","<p>I have a 1992 Volvo 940. A few months ago, the speedometer started malfunctioning intermittently. Sometimes it would read correctly, other times the needle would wobble around, and sometimes it would read zero. It was more likely to misbehave at highway speed (say, over 50 mph).</p>

<p>What are the possible causes?</p>
","<p>There are four possible culprits:</p>

<ul>
<li>The vehicle speed sensor which plugs into the back of the differential</li>
<li>The wiring from the speed sensor to the back of the instrument panel</li>
<li>The printed circuit board on the back of the instrument cluster</li>
<li>The speedometer itself</li>
</ul>

<p>As always with electrical problems, test the simplest/cheapest component first. In this case, it's the wiring. You can run your own wiring from the sensor, up through one of the holes in the floor of the trunk (covered by rubber plugs, which you can easily remove), through the passenger compartment (through the ski passthrough if it's a sedan) and to the back of the instrument cluster. Instructions for removing the cluster and identifying the sensor wiring are here:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.brickboard.com/FAQ/700-900/ElectricalInstruments.htm"">http://www.brickboard.com/FAQ/700-900/ElectricalInstruments.htm</a></p>

<p>Having tested with your own ""known good"" wiring, further problems are the fault of either the speed sensor or the speedometer/instrument cluster. Speedometer failures are common in these cars due to leaking capacitors on the speedometer's integrated circuit board (separate from the printed circuit board on the back of the instrument cluster. The 940 speedometer is made by Yazaki, for which replacement parts are difficult or impossible to find. I was only able to find two shops that claimed to be able to test and repair the gauge. They are listed in this forum post:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.brickboard.com/RWD/volvo/1453661/940/960/980/V90/S90/yazaki_speedometer_repair_sources_updated.html"">http://www.brickboard.com/RWD/volvo/1453661/940/960/980/V90/S90/yazaki_speedometer_repair_sources_updated.html</a></p>

<p>Replacement speed sensors cost over $100. Your best bet is to have a gauge shop bench test the gauge itself to determine if it is at fault. If the problem is intermittent, they may have to test for a long time. If necessary, the repair will cost $200–$400, not including shipping. Alternatively, if you are good at (un)soldering very small circuit board connections, you could order replacement capacitors and repair the speedometer yourself. More details about diagnosing and repairing Volvo 700/900 speedometer problems can be found here:</p>

I can easily put the brake to the floor. The vehicle is a '98 Chevy Malibu. I have seen some references to bleeding the brakes. Could that be it? </p>

<p>Update: One other question I just thought of. Can the reservoir be too full? Could that cause problems?</p>
","<p>Bleeding the brake will remove air in your brakes line. If you only replace the pads without disconnecting any brake lines, no air should have entered the system.</p>

<p>BUT, since you have played with your brakes, and with the symptoms you have, you should bleed the brakes to remove any air. Air in the brake line can make the pedal softer and can also prevent you from braking. I've changed my brakes (pads, rotors and calipers) this summer and had a soft pedal and re-bleeding the brake solved my issue. </p>

<p>Also, if your brake line are old they can bulge under the brake fluid pressure, which can also create the soft pedal as you described. Then you can change your brake lines and even switch them to stainless steel lines that won't bulge, but are way more expensive!</p>

"Slower Engine Start When ""Cold""","13540","","<p>I have a 2012 Honda Civic EX (4 Cyl Automatic, 5-speed transmission, Regular Gasoline). I get it serviced regularly and it has around 28k miles. The engine light has never come on.</p>

<p>I am noticing this summer, in moderate to high humidity weather, 70 - 85 F, in the morning (when the car has been off for at least 12-14 hours), that starting is taking significantly longer than I'm used to.</p>

<p>I've started the car from cold on extremely cold winter days this past winter with no noticeable delay in start. But just recently I started to see this, and I'd like to know if it's something I should be concerned about.</p>

<h3>Cold Start (12 hours or more since last run)</h3>

<p>I put the key in, turn it to start, I hear the engine crank a few times, but then for almost a whole second (OK, maybe more like 0.6 seconds on average), there are 0 RPMs and the engine is completely silent. For that split-second, it's like the thing is dead, but then it suddenly comes to life and starts. It doesn't sound like it's starting rough, or making any kind of strange noises; it just <em>sits there</em> for a significant fraction of a second after it's done cranking but before it starts to run on its own.</p>

<p>It's to the point that, if I hold the key down in the ""starting"" position for the same length of time as I do when I start the car on a ""Hot"" start (when running the engine very recently), the car won't start. I have to intentionally hold it down until <em>after</em> the little hang/hitch passes, to get it running first thing in the morning.</p>

<h3>Hot Start (started it within the past hour or two)</h3>

<p>I put the key in, turn it to start, I hear the engine crank <em>fewer</em> times than on a cold start, and it jumps right to life within maybe 2 seconds max, with no delay. I barely have to hold the key in the starting position at all, it's REALLY fast.</p>

<p>The only thing that's alarming me is that the cold start behavior is a <em>change</em> from what it used to do, and this car has been through summer 2011, winter 2011, summer 2012, winter 2012, and now summer 2013. I use the recommended oil (0W-30) and usually get fully synthetic, except that the dealership's first free oil change they gave me a synthetic blend.</p>

<p>I don't notice a difference in any other characteristics of the engine. It doesn't run rough; MPG is excellent (just like it was on day 1 out of the dealership, in fact); it handles the load of the A/C quite well. I <em>do</em> usually run the car with the A/C or heat on, except for a few weeks in the fall and spring, where it's cool enough that I can turn it off, but not blasted cold.</p>

<p><strong>Should I be concerned about this?</strong> Is this even a problem, or am I just overreacting to a natural side effect of my car having 28k miles on it? This is the first car I've owned since it was new, I'm used to driving old rustbuckets from the 80s and 90s, so I'm not used to seeing a car age.</p>
","<p>It actually sounds like a fuel supply issue to me.  My Eclipse (most likely due to the a difference in the replacement fuel pressure regulator that was installed after the original one failed) isn't able to hold fuel pressure in the rail when off for more than a few hours.  So, those ""cold"" starts all take more cranking and it usually has the same half second pause in the cranking too.  Presumably it's happening because there's nothing firing yet to assist, the battery is starting to drop off, the starter is starting to warm up, and it's hitting a high compression point all at the same time.  After the pause it cranks some more and eventually gets enough fuel to fire and runs fine.</p>

<ul>
<li>Should it not be able to run without it after the engine has started firing?</li>
</ul></li>

","<p>It's because of a couple things: The battery is very dead and the alternator cannot put out enough power at idle RPMs to run the whole system and charge a battery. This leads to a lack of power which may kill one or more systems most likely the spark ""ignition"" system since this takes the most power and is necessary to run the car.</p>

<p>In Fact you can remove the battery all together making sure the positive cable is insulated and run the car that way too. At Least once you get it started.</p>

<hr>

<p>Andre Borie has a good point. removing the battery can potentially cause damage to some of the more delicate electronics in the car. This is due to the battery acting like a big capacitor smoothing out some of the larger spikes in the electrical system. These spikes can originate from many different sources: the alternator, power surges from the coil packs, or even a wire crossing something like a spark plug wire causing some induction.</p>

"Seized brake caliper following brake pad & disc replacement - what could be wrong?","13490","","<p>Took my 2006 VW Touareg in for servicing and had the dealership replace the rear brake pads and discs. In a post-replacement test drive the dealership discovered that one of the sides has a stuck caliper, and the brake doesn't want to let go.</p>

<p>By suggesting the ABS unit, I believe they're simply insuring themselves against liability claims in the future (""we told you so"").</p>

<p>The brakes were fine prior to the servicing and brake hardware refresh, so what could possibly have happened to cause one of the brakes to stick like that?
Could the presence of excessive brake fluid explain this?</p>

<p>With this question I'm looking to elicit <em>technical</em> reasons for what could be causing one of the brakes to bind.</p>
","<p>It sounds to me like they cocked the piston in the caliper sideways when they collapsed it during the brake job. This could be caused from a worn caliper piston. It may or may not have been their fault, but would be hard to prove. My suggestion is to have the caliper replaced. This <em>should</em> fix the issue. </p>

<p>I don't see any way this could be related to the ABS unit, unless they think the brake fluid is not being allowed to migrate back up the lines after braking. I've not heard of a unit creating it's own one way check valve, though.</p>

<p>I'm not sure how the Toureg's brakes transition (slide). This may be an area of concern as well. If the slides are rusted or otherwise obstructed, this could be causing an issue, but would assume the mechanic would have picked up on this.</p>

","<p>Tirerack.com has an <a href=""http://www.tirerack.com/tires/tiretech/techpage.jsp?techid=198"" rel=""nofollow"">excellent page explaining how tires react on different width rims</a>.</p>

<p>The summary version is that tires can fit on a variety of rims, and thus rims can accept a variety of tires. The best approach is to determine the rim's width and ensure that it is within the specification of the tire. There is also the concept of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_sizing"" rel=""nofollow"">""plus sizing""</a> where a tire with a smaller aspect ratio is chosen to balance out the wider width.</p>

<p>While I encourage you to check the specifications (I haven't), I strongly suspect that a move from 195 to 205 will be just fine. From the <a href=""http://www.scionlife.com/forums/showpost.php?p=4050213&amp;postcount=3"" rel=""nofollow"">research of one poster</a> on Scionlife.com:</p>

  <li>225/55/16</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>I think the 205/60/16 would look great, it would give the XD more of a mini-SUV appearance. The allowed rim width for that tire size is 5.5""- 7.5"", so you are good to go with the factory 16x6""steel wheel.</p>

"Should I run my generator dry in preparation for storage?","13379","","<p>I think this is on-topic after reading the FAQ, so I figured I'd go ahead and ask.</p>

<p>I gave my gas generator its scheduled 3-month interval ""workout"" last night, and after letting it run for about 30 minutes, I turned the fuel valve off and let it run until it died so there wouldn't be any gas left in the fuel lines. I use ethanol-free gas with Sta-Bil added to it. Then I siphon out whatever's left in the tank after the generator has been shut down. However in the last few seconds it was running, the whole generator started shaking and making a terrible racket. Should I not do this - am I putting more wear on the engine than I would by letting old gas sit in the fuel lines? </p>

<p>I've heard what seems to be conflicting results in running engines out of gas. For cars it's bad, but the overwhelming online opinion for generators seems to be that running them dry before storage is the best option. Is this because automobile fuel pumps can be damaged by running dry, but since generators are usually gravity-fed, it isn't harmful to them?</p>
","<p>I recommend to everyone I know to run your generator or other small equipment dry before storage. The main purpose of this is to get all of the ethanol based fuel out of carburetor and fuel bowl. Ethanol has a propensity of gumming things up and can leave a lot of varnish over time. This tends to plug orifices needed for proper fuel metering while running, and thus kills the carb. I've unsuccessfully attempted to rebuild small engine carbs, but found it much easier/cheaper (time vs. cost) to replace. I have had to replace two carbs out of three small equipment pieces with gas engines. Since I started running them dry, I've had no issues. Starting takes a few more pulls of the cord, but once the bowl fills, they fire without too much hassle.</p>

<p>As far as the bucking goes, this would be normal as the bowl runs out of fuel. As long as you do not have a load on your generator when you do this, it should not cause any issue.</p>

<p>One other thing for proper maintenance. When giving your generator a ""workout"", make sure you plug something into it and run it. Something which will actually put a load on the generator. Generators are built to work. They tend to not like to just ""run"" ... for some reason this tends to wear them out quicker. You are running it anyway, so plugging something into it and running it should not cause you any concern. I run a 15A shop vac on mine, which is a 5250w running generator. Gives it a little bit of a workout.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Loud knock is caused by the introduction of high pressure cold fuel into very high cylinder pressures.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, who's right?</p>
","<p>The engine operates on high compression to ignite the fuel at very low RPMs which gives it it's distinctive sound. The lower RPM makes the ignition of each cylinder easier to hear and the compression ignition system gives it it's rattle like sound. This is as opposed to gasoline engines that operate by a spark/compression ignition system. The key to understanding this lies in understanding the diesel engine. See: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_engine"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the Wiki page for this.</a></p>

<p>In short, the distinctiveness of your typical diesel sound comes from a combination of it's properties of low RPMs and the high compression ignition system. The actual sounds are generated at combustion and the opening and closing of valves. You really cannot hear the injection of the fluids into the chambers. Also, as another poster first pointed out (DucatiKiller), there is sometimes a piston slap that make a audible sound but not always in newer engines. </p>

<p>I've had a 'false neutral' when changing gears and instead of engaging the next gear the gears don't quite engage and you end up between them. Older bikes with higher mileage might be more prone to this. To avoid it make sure you're giving the lever good positive pressure and moving it the full distance of lever travel. It it also seems to help the gears engage if you hold pressure on the gear lever a little longer as you release the clutch. And maybe be a bit more gentle on the throttle when changing.</p>

<p>I have had bikes jump out of gear as you describe on a couple of occasions. I put it down to not having the gear properly engaged.</p>

<p>I had 1 bike that had a badly worn gearbox. 2nd gear was so badly worn that it would jump teeth. The edges of the gear dog teeth were rounded. I had the gearbox stripped down and had the gears 'undercut'. This puts a fine angle on the mating surfaces of gear teeth which means that under load they positively engage. This is not a simple task and should only be entrusted to an experienced specialist. </p>

<p>If it becomes a regular occurrence for you, you might be looking at a gearbox rebuild. Im not a vstrom expert but its possible there might be some adjustment or tolerances that might make a difference. Maybe even play in worn bearings might be a factor. </p>

<p>But as I said at the start if it's only happened a few times i wouldn't be too concerned.</p>

"Motorcycle chain degreasing","13296","","<p>What are the pros and cons of the various chain degreasing techniques. I want to maintain my chain and sprockets to the best possible standard and have heard many schools of thought on chain cleaning but I'd like an engineers perspective on the best method for keeping a chain maintained without <a href=""http://www.sheldonbrown.com/chainclean.html"" rel=""nofollow"">taking the chain off</a>.</p>

<p>What I've tried:</p>

<ul>
<li>On a really dirty bike whose previous owner had never cleaned the chain, there was years of caked grime and grease and asphalt, I put the bike on centre-stand, put it in first (running) and pointed a hot soapy jet wash at the chain for ten minutes. I found a pretty decent shiny chain in surprisingly good condition under all the guck. (warning for the uninitiated: this is dangerous. It's not intended as advice. Don't try this at home. Chains should <strong>never</strong> be cleaned while the engine is running.)</li>
<li>When I first started chain maintenance, I would get through a full aerosol can of whatever brand motorcycle chain cleaner happened to be cheapest at a motor factors. I would rarely get a clean chain without using the full can.</li>
<li>Later, I bought a three-sided chain brush and found I could get away with only a third or half a can of aerosol degreaser by scrubbing while spraying and wiping away muck with a rag.</li>
</ul>

<p>Specifically:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are cheap(er), citrus based degreaser products (like <a href=""http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/290967791120"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> or <a href=""http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/350973523861"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a>) safe to use on a motorcycle chain? Will they damage my o-rings? (also: what are o-rings?)</li>
<li>Is WD40 (or similar) harmful to a chain? Some say that it removes lubricant from the chain internals so you should avoid it or only use it if the chain is off the bike and can be really thoroughly re-lubricated after the clean. Is this true?</li>
</ul>
","<p>I personally prefer citrus-based cleaner. I had used Park Tools bicycle chain cleaner, because I had it laying around, and it works great, although expensive. I plan on buying generic cleaner in large containers. It also has a benefit of being bio-degradable (oil and gunk is not, but at least it doesn’t add to the water-table pollution hazard).</p>

<p>I usually pour a little of the cleaner in an open container, and use brush to dip into it, and spread cleaner over the chain. This way you don’t contaminate the rest, and only use a little at a time. After the chain is clean, I would wash it off with water (often, chain cleaning is coincident with bike wash — wash the top side, clean the chain, wash it off and finish the wheels and bottom), let it dry and help, if possible, with compressed air to blow as much water out as possible.</p>

<p>There are other solvents that can be used to clean chain drive, such as kerosene or mineral spirit, but they are messier, and nastier (have to use rubber gloves with them) whereas citrus-based solvent works real well, smells nice, and have little side-effects, if any.</p>

<p>Whichever cleaner you use, you have to make sure it is safe for rubber, which is what O-rings usually made of. Most bicycle chains and chain drives in controlled and clean industrial setting do not have those, but motorcycle chains have O-rings, which is basically a seal on both sides on the inside of each roller surrounding pins, with grease packed inside of them. This way the grease is protected, the pin-roller interface is always lubricated, and the operator only have to worry about cleaning and lubricating outer plates and sprockets. If the seals dry out, lose their elasticity and crack, the grease would come out (can sometimes be evident by coloured residue on the chain) and the dirt would come in wearing the chain prematurely.</p>

<p>As for WD-40 or similar light oils, they would not be efficient cleaners, and not very good lubricants for the application. I normally just use gear oil applied with a brush at home on a stand, or low-fling chain wax out of the can when out on the road for extended period of time (all-day trips).</p>

<p>Final point. I do not clean the chain every time I oil it. I oil the chain every 300-400 km (200-250 miles), and on average clean the chain only every 3<sup>rd</sup> or 4<sup>th</sup> oiling when riding in the city, unless it’s been contaminated heavy with dust and dirt after being out on the trail, or winter slush with road salt.</p>

<p><strong>Claims and comment:</strong></p>

<p>1) Cleaning combustion chamber, intake valves and fuel injectors thus reducing engine knock tendencies: This is an excellent goal. It could improve mileage if the engine has enough deposits to cause the engine controller to have to correct for knock. Top Tier approval would ensure this claim.</p>

<p>2) Friction reduction modifier: The claim here is that the product contains an ingredient that reduces piston ring friction and gets into the engine oil and then reduces friction throughout the engine. Proof is required for this. Others have made this claim and been proven wrong over the years. Modern engine oils are excellent stand alone products not in need of additives. Also, most if not all, OEM's do not approve oil additives and friction modifiers as they can damage the catalyst over time.</p>

"Difference between FWD/RWD/4WD/Part-Time 4WD/AWD?","13200","","<p>I'm curious as to what are the particular difference between the various drive systems available in modern vehicles.  FWD and RWD are pretty straightforward - Front Wheel Drive cars put the power to the front wheels, Rear Wheel Drive puts it in the rear.  However, the remaining variants are less clear to me.</p>

<p>What is the difference between 4WD and ""Part-Time"" 4WD?
How is AWD different from any 4WD?  Are there any systems I've missed?</p>
","<p>To expand a little on what Eric said...</p>

<p>I consider the 4WD versus AWD to largely be marketing terms differentiating between vehicles with additional ground clearance and plating underneath to protect sensitive components while going over rough terrain off-road travel (4WD) from systems that are targeted more towards on-road travel (AWD).  Though this is confused more by companies making their own names for all wheel drive systems like quattro, Syncro, SH-AWD, Hydratrak, etc...</p>

<p>I think it's worth differentiating between these flavors of drive:</p>

<ul>
<li>Full time AWD.  These systems are designed to be left engaged even when on dry roads.</li>
<li>Part-time AWD.  These systems usually have a locked center differential AKA transfer case, which is will cause excessive wear on the drivetrain and/or tires if left engaged on dry roads.  It's meant only to be engaged in reduced traction situations like snow, ice, gravel.</li>
<li>Hi/Lo AWD.  This is probably the most likely to be called 4WD, because it's usually fitted on vehicles meant for off-road use.  This will either be part time or full time, and on older vehicles would also have ""locking hubs"" up front.  This has an additional set of gears after the transmission, which can increase the gear ratio, particularly for off-roading or other high torque applications.</li>
<li>RWD.  Only the rear wheels are driven.</li>
<li>FWD.  Only the front wheels are driven.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, beyond AWD, FWD, and RWD, there are the front and rear differentials that can make a dramatic difference in how well a vehicle can handle low traction conditions.  The differential is what connects the drive-line to two output shafts, say the ones going to the wheels on the left and right sides.  It allows the wheels to turn at different rates as you go around corners.  The inside wheels will describe a smaller circle, and therefore travel less distance than the outside wheels.</p>

<p>Not all differentials are created equal.  Normally, differentials are of a type called ""open"".  A sad artifact of these differentials is that power goes to the wheel with the least traction.  So if one wheel is on ice, and one is on dry pavement, you will sit there spinning your wheels.</p>

<p>There are also a huge variety of ""limited slip"" or ""locking"" differentials which either allow you to manually lock and unlock them, or automatically distribute power to both wheels.  These are more frequently found on sports cars, sometimes as additional-price option packs or upgrades, sometimes standard, in RWD and FWD cars.  They are also used in better AWD systems in the center, front, and/or rear differentials.</p>

<p>There are also some hybrid systems, such as Audi's quattro system.  Some models of this use a Torsen center limited slip differential, and open differentials in the front and back, but they do this trick where they use the ABS sensors to detect wheel spin, and then apply brakes to the spinning wheel, forcing it traction to go to the other wheels.  While not literally a limited slip differential in the front and back, this is still extremely effective.</p>

<p>Sadly, the manufacturers don't really make it clear what exactly their system is.  In short:</p>

<ul>
<li>If there is a lever or button to turn on AWD/4WD, it is a part-time system.</li>
<li>AWD versus 4WD are basically the same, but 4WD tends to be used on off-road oriented vehicles.</li>
<li>Not all AWD systems are created equal, so you'll have to research if you want specific functionality out of the system..</li>

"Will a worn clutch ever completely fail to engage? If not, what will cause this?","13200","","<p>I've noticed my clutch beginning to slip for maybe a month or two;  it was slower to engage, but not badly enough to affect driving.  Over the last week or so, it was getting significantly worse every day (driving less than 10 miles per day).  The last day I drove it, it was having trouble in every gear, and I barely got it home.  I got a replacement clutch, and when I left to drive to the shop to have it installed, realized it's now completely not engaging -- it won't move with the clutch completely engaged.</p>

<p>Will a badly worn clutch cause this?  Or did I break something else by waiting too long to fix it?  What other possible problems would cause this behavior?  This is on a 1999 Mercedes SLK230.</p>
","<p>I don't know about a Mercedes in particular, but that's exactly what happens when a clutch goes bad. There are three main parts to a clutch: pressure plate; friction disk; and flywheel. Each has a specific function:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flywheel""><strong>Flywheel</strong></a> - is a rotating mechanical device that is used to store rotational energy. This part is usually attached to the rear of an engine (on the crackshaft). </li>
<li><strong>Pressure plate</strong> - is a spring loaded device which is attached to the flywheel. It is the clamping mechanism which, in concert with the flywheel, grabs the friction disk when engaged to create a single unit.</li>
<li><strong>Friction disk</strong> - is a relatively thin plate with friction material bonded to it. There is a hole in the center of the friction disk which the main shaft of the transmission goes through. It is connection between the engine and the transmission. </li>
</ul>

<p>When a clutch starts to wear out, usually it is because the friction material starts be used up. As it becomes thinner, the pressure plate has less material to grab onto and so the slipping starts. The metal faces of the pressure plate and flywheel may also start to become worn, but they do not wear nearly as fast as the friction disk does. The friction material on the disk can be directly related to the friction material which is used on brakes. </p>

<p>The worn clutch is a self feeding animal. The only time it wears is when it is either being engaged or disengaged. During this period of time, the friction material is slipping past the metal faces of the flywheel and pressure plate. This induces heat from friction. When the clutch is engaged (pedal out), no slippage should be occurring, so no wear is occurring. When a clutch starts to slip when it is engaged, the wear process starts happening quicker. The more it slips, the more friction material is eaten up. It gets to the point, as you discovered, where the clutch quits performing its duty at all. </p>

<p>It used to be when cars utilized metal cables attached to the clutch pedal to disengage the clutch, there might be the ability to adjust the clutch a little which allowed the clutch to last longer. Now days, with hydraulic actuation, they self adjust for the most part. The problem is, when they go, they go. It usually happens pretty fast when it does. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> (I realized I didn't answer part of your question) - While you purchased a clutch for replacement, you might also have damaged the flywheel in the process. Once the clutch starts slipping, a lot of heat is built up in the flywheel. This can cause heat cracks in the surface. Most of the time these aren't very deep, but they need to be removed in order to reuse it. This is a simple machining process which almost any shop can do or have done. If the heat cracks were too deep, the flywheel may need to be replaced. Also, when a clutch is replaced, this is an opportune time to replace the throw out bearing and inspect other parts which are easy to get to while the transmission and engine are separated, such as the rear main seal.</p>

<p>I hope this helps make sense of your issue so you can figure out what exactly has happened with your vehicle.</p>

","<p>I would say that it is most likely a balancing issue. In order to find out, I would:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use the car's jack to clear each front wheel from the ground. Give the wheel a spin and <strong>check to see that the spinning tire does not vibrate</strong> (sideways and/or up-and-down). This could indicate a damaged rim or a damaged tire.</li>
<li>If pt. 1 does not give any indication, <strong>unmount the tire and get it balanced</strong>. You may have the equipment to do this yourself &mdash; if not, consult your regular mechanic.</li>

"Torque wrench vs regular ratchet","13156","","<p>What is the difference between a torque wrench and a regular ratchet that you'd normally use with sockets?  When should you use one vs. the other in automotive applications?</p>
","<p><strong>Torque wrenches</strong> are used for adjusting the specific tightness of nuts and bolts. They come with an adjustable torque setting which is usually in foot pounds (english) or Newton meters (metric). In automotive applications, most nuts/bolts will have a torque setting specified in the manual that when applied will give the exact amount of pressure needed to operate smoothly.</p>

<p><strong>Regular ratchets</strong> have no adjustable torque setting. Typically you would refer to the tightness of what you were working on as 'hand-tight'.  </p>

<p>For lugs nuts on wheels for example; you would definitely want to use a torque wrench to ensure the nuts are not too loose or too tight. By using a torque wrench, you can ensure that all of the nuts are tightened with the right amount pressure, which would more than likely be imperfect when using a regular ratchet.</p>

"Clutch pedal suddenly doesn't go deep enough to engage gears","13073","","<p>I was driving normally (no problems, everything going smoothly; never had felt any problems with the clutch, was catching on well etc.) and <strong>all of a sudden</strong>, with no warning sign or anything (no shock, no bang, nothing), the <strong>clutch pedal doesn't go far enough anymore</strong> to engage the gears in a normal way. I was still driving and it still worked more or less (but it was bumpy changing gears, as one would expect, and not very healthy for the car, I think), so I stopped at a place where it was safe to do so. It goes about 3/4 of the way, then there's a lot of resistance and I can't push it any further -- it's not just hard to push further, it's impossible (unless I would put so much force on it that it would break or something).</p>

<p>I didn't want to drive it like this (can't engage the gears unless I would put too much force on it, which I don't want to do), so I left the car at the safe spot and asked someone to come pick us up and we'll have it towed tomorrow. </p>

<p>EDIT: the clutch pedal works again -- I don't know how this is possible, but it's still not going smoothly, so it was certainly more than just an obstruction of the clutch pedal. When I shift and slowly release the clutch while pressing in the gas, it's supposed to be smooth, now it's bumpy. It's technically speaking drivable, but it's everything but a smooth ride.</p>
","<p>After your last edit and a few minutes of thinking about your situation I have one more question. </p>

<p><em>When he vehicle is in gear and moving is there any noise? With the pedal fully depressed is there any noise?</em></p>

<p>I am going to assume the answer to those are both no and there is simply just difficulty switching gears and the roughness felt during pedal travel. That being said, it sounds like the throw out bearing / clutch release bearing has failed or is about to really fail (no one likes being stranded). Its not uncommon for the failure so don't feel like you've done something wrong. It may be worth your while to pickup a full clutch kit for the car. It will come with a clutch, pressure plate, flywheel (might be extra in some kits), and a throw out bearing.</p>

"Is sand blasting safe on old cars?","12980","","<p>As the title says, when restoring a classic car I've been typically taught it was proper to get the entire vehicle sand blasted to see any issues and make any needed repairs them move to paint.  However, is sand blasting safe or does it do more damage then good?</p>
","<p>Sandblasting your frame is fine. Sandblasting your body or any panel can be debated until the pigs fly home. People have been doing it for decades, and get by. </p>

<p>However, when you sandblast your body/panels, you run the risk of creating more metal/bodywork for you to do in your restoration. This is because the heat from the sandblaster can warp the panels. If you are not able to repair metal the primitive way, then you are looking at adding body fill to compensate for the damage.</p>

<p>That being said, there are other options.</p>

<p><strong>""Dustless"", Water Based Blasting</strong></p>

<p>This type of blasting can also be called slurry blasting. The unit holds water, your abrasive of choice, (preferably glass), and a rust inhibitor. You can thoroughly clean any surface, and not have to worry about the metal warping, or rusting. The water cools the metal, and the rust inhibitor will prevent it from flash rusting.</p>

<p>When you are done, you then spray down the vehicle with an attachment such as the Chameleon. The rust inhibitor is inside the canister to prevent flash rusting while you rinse the abrasive off the panel. You can then dry it with a leaf blower. </p>

<p>After all that work, you are ready to paint immediately if there is no welding/bodywork to be done. The cleaning process is done within the blast. This is the only method which is endorsed by the major paint companies like Sherwin Williams and PPG.</p>

<p><strong>Soda Blasting</strong></p>

<p>Soda blasting will create comparable results to water based blasting, with one minor downfall. The cleaning process. If you do not thoroughly clean the sprayed application, you can welcome the possibility of severe issues in your paint process. Horror stories of high end paint jobs where the paint flakes off is not uncommon. </p>

<p><strong>Acid Dipping</strong></p>

<p>You can get your metal dipped acid. This can be cost effective or not depending on your location. Some cities may not even offer this alternative. Size is generally the biggest issue you may encounter with this method.</p>

<p><strong>Grinding</strong></p>

<p>Lastly, you can use a wire brush. It's very time consuming, and physically exhausting. It can be done, and is an age old method that many people take. You will need a high amp grinder.</p>

<p>This holds true to my line of thought because a flat tire (or very low tire) will make a lot more noise than a full tire will. According to the write-up, one of the reasons noise is created by tires is because air gets trapped within the tread pattern as the tire rolls onto the pavement and the car is pressing down upon the tire. As the tire rolls forward, the air is released and makes noise. This is reduced when the tire is fully inflated versus one which is low on air pressure.</p>

<p>I think that neoprene o-rings are used in special places (like an A/C line) where oil is going to be present, just for this purpose.</p>
","<p>tl dr - Have no fear of Vaseline and o-rings</p>

<p>O-rings are made out of <em>many</em> different materials. I would suggest that those o-rings which are made to work in the automotive realm are made to be resistant to things such as oil, gasoline, and other petroleum products. This would include Vaseline. While Vaseline and other petroleum products may degrade real rubber (actually made from the rubber tree), <em>current o-rings technology does not use natural rubber</em>. <a href=""https://www.parker.com/literature/ORD%205700%20Parker_O-Ring_Handbook.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Parker O-ring Handbook</a> states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A polymer is the “result of a chemical linking of molecules into a long chain-like structure.” Both plastics and elastomers are classifi ed as polymers. In this handbook, polymer generally refers to a basic class of elastomer, members
  of which have similar chemical and physical properties. O-rings are made from many polymers, but <strong>a few polymers account for the majority of O-rings produced, namely Nitrile, EPDM and Neoprene</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Emphasis mine.</p>

<p>Looking further into the handbook will give you this matrix of how well different types of materials fair against different things:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/j2VOM.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/j2VOM.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Looking throughout the matrix you can see that natural rubber does very poorly against oil, while Neoprene does fair to good and Nitrile does excellent. (Note: Even though EPDM is said to be used as one of the big three substances, I'm not finding it on the list.) </p>

<p>With this in mind, you should have no worries about whether to utilize Vaseline on any of the o-rings. Vaseline is a <em>very mild</em> petroleum product. If it wasn't, we wouldn't use it in so many products which involve skin care. If o-rings were actually made of rubber, then there would be concern.</p>

"Is tire rotation important?","12891","","<p>I just bought new tires for my car and included was free tire rotation every 7,500 miles for the life of the tires.</p>

<p>I have heard many things about tire rotation, including:</p>

<ol>
<li>it's a worthless practice, don't bother</li>
<li>tires should never be rotated from one side of the car to another (something about the tires rotating in the opposite direction and the belts inside shifting)</li>
<li>tires should always be rotated in an X pattern (front tires straight back, back tires get swapped and put on the front)</li>
</ol>

<p>Is there any real value in rotating the tires? is it just about evenly distributing the wear of the tread on the tire? Can this be achieved just through careful monitoring of the tire pressure and alignment of the car?</p>
","<p>While I believe the tire shop gives free rotation to get you in the habit of coming back to them every few months so they can sell you more, it can be important to rotate your tires.</p>

<p><em>It all depends on the wear of the tires</em></p>

<p>I have had sets of tires that wore extremely evenly and I only rotated them once.  Other sets of tires I have had wore very unevenly and had to rotate them multiple times during the life of that set.</p>

<p>For the question of rotation arrangement:</p>

<ol>
<li>It depends on your car's manual</li>
<li>It depends on your specific tires</li>
</ol>

<p>As other people have said, some tires are unidirectional and if you put the tires on the other side of the car, you will have problems.  Most of the recent cars I have driven tell you to rotate your tires front to back and NOT across the car.  I believe many manufacturers are going to unidirectional tires.</p>

<p>The real value that comes from rotating your tires is that when the tires wear unevenly, rotating the tires spreads the wear out more evenly on each tire as well, as over the set.</p>

<p>On each tire — some cars and/or driver's habits cause the front tires to wear more in certain places of the tire, moving the tires to the rear axle generally cause those worn places to not get used as hard and wear the other places on the tires. (i.e., a lot of FWD car's front tires wear a good bit on the corners since they are used for steering and power)</p>

<p>Over the set — the tires on the powered axle tend to wear out faster since more force is exerted through them to the pavement.  To maximize the life of the tires, you switch the tires on the powered axle to the non-powered axle so that those less-used tires (with more tread) are used to even the wear.</p>

"Mixing DOT 4 with DOT 4 synthetic","12706","","<p>I couldn't see an existing question about this but please link to it if you know of one ...</p>

<p>I should point out I'm English and the products described are bought in the UK, in case it makes a difference.</p>

<p>The car in question is a 1971 Morris Traveller.</p>

<p>I have always used DOT4 brake fluid with this, and another car of similar age, with no troubles.</p>

<p>However recently I bought another brand of DOT 4 brake fluid whcih had the word ""Synthetic"" written on it. Hmm. I don't think my usual supplier's bottles has this word.</p>

<p>After topping up with the new brand, a few days later the brake master cylinder gave way such that the pedal didn't operate any brakes (little/no resistance) but no fluid was leaking from amywhere. As a result  I nearly had a nasty accident. Fortuately owing to a bit of luck the car and I escaped unharmed.</p>

<p>I see a few possibilities :</p>

<ul>
<li><p>1) The reason I had to top the Master Cylinder up in the 1st place was a hint at impending troubles, and the new brand of brake fluid has ntohing to do with this.
or .. </p></li>
<li><p>2) Mixing the DOT 4 and DOT 4 synthetic has caused some issue with the rubber seals.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>or </p>

<ul>
<li>3) something I haven't thought of and won't know til I get it all apart.</li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously I don't want to be mixing fluids wrongly but I also don't want to go replacing the brake system unnecesarily either !</p>

<p>So the question .. </p>

<p>Has anoyone used DOT4 synthetic &amp; DOT4  'doesn't mention synthetic' at all ? Are they ok to mix together ?</p>

<p>thanks for all help</p>
","<p>The information &amp; links posted by Paulster2 offer excellent explanation of what the various types of brake fluid are.</p>

<p>There are a few grade :</p>

<ul>
<li>DOT3 </li>
<li>DOT4 </li>
<li>DOT5 </li>
<li>DOT5.1</li>
</ul>

<p>The difference between them is a specificed standard regarding the boiling temperature, which rises as the DOT number rises, and amount of water absorption.</p>

<p>There are based on two materials: Glycol based (""traditional"" brake fluid) and Silicone based. DOT5 is exclusively silicone based because only silicone meets the criteria specified by the DOT5 standard.</p>

<p>As regards mixing them:
Generally this is a bad idea, but the main thing warned against is mixing Silicone based fluid with Glycol. This thranslates to not mixing DOT 5 with any other DOT standard fluid.</p>

<p>However mixing for example Glycol DOT3 with Glycol DOT4 would give unpredictable performance. Nowhere have I seen anything saying ""this is ok"". I suspect the reason is that a mixture of formulations may give an unproven boiling temperature.</p>

<p>One apparent red herring is the word ""Synthetic"" - Glycol based brake fluids may or may not claim to be ""synthetic"". This doesn't necessarily relate to whether the fluid is glycol based or silicon.</p>

<p>In a nutshell :</p>

<ul>
<li>Don't mix the DOT ratings, unless you're adding a higher rating resulting in a raised boiling point</li>
<li>Don't mix glycol based and silicone based fluids (ie don't mix DOT 5 with any other rating)</li>
<li>Given that axiom, you can mix brands of brake fluid for the same rating/base material.</li>

There is residue paint from the old gasket on both the head and block side.  Should I do it carefully with a razor blade or sand paper or perhaps use something non-abrasive like microfiber cloth with Brakleen?  I believe both the heads and the block are made of aluminum but the cylinder jackets are stainless steel.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TcAjp.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>You shouldn't sand the block at all unless there is existing damage of some kind - but it really doesn't take much to damage, even a fine scratch can ruin the seal for the gasket. If you have to sand it, you will have to finish it to quite a fine grade and be very careful about keeping the surface relatively even/level. </p>

<p>If you are very careful, you can use a razor blade to scrape the old residue off the block - just remember that if you scratch it at all, you'll have to repair the damage (by sanding and resurfacing the affected area of the block). Many people use plastic tools (any kind of hard-edged plastic scraper) to avoid the possibility of scratching the surface. </p>

<p>Chemical gasket remover compounds are also available, which smell like death, eat disposable gloves, and burn your skin, but will chemically eat away any gasket residue. I don't have any personal experience with them, but for $10 or so for a tube it may be worth a try. If you don't need something as heavy-duty as gasket remover, you can try a solvent like varsol/paint thinner to help loosen the remnants. </p>

"How do I finish my DIY, single-stage paint job to a gloss?","12583","","<p>After driving around with a huge hole in my front bumper cover for two years, I finally decided to replace it myself.  I bought a new bumper cover through my local friendly auto body supply store, along with a gray primer and a custom-made single stage paint that they loaded into a spray can for me.</p>

<p>I took it home, sanded it with the gray scotch brite pad, wiped it down, and applied two layers of primer, waiting a full day and sanding between each coat.  I then applied two layers of my custom single-stage paint, again waiting a full day between each coat.</p>

<p>After installing the painted bumper and waiting a few more days, I scrubbed at it by hand with an old sock and some Turtle Wax Premium Polishing Compound.  It now looks like this:</p>

<p><strong>What critical step am I missing?</strong></p>

<p>I see a lot of auto forums that casually mention ""cutting"" the paint, as in the phrase ""cut, buff, and polish"".  What is ""cutting"" a new paint job, and is this the step I'm missing?</p>

<p>I also see references to ""rubbing compound"", which is supposed to be a coarser grit compared to the polishing compound.  Could this be what I'm missing?</p>
","<p>The paintwork looks like it's suffering from orange peel.  It may be that you need more or thicker coats on it.</p>

<p>To get a nice shiny finish from what you have you effectively need to flatten out the outer surface of the paint finish.  There are a few ways to do this.  As stated previously, cutting paste can be quite effective but may take quite a long time.  I'd personally get some very high grade sand paper.  I'd get something like 1500 or 2000 grade wet and dry.  Consider 1200 grade if that's all that's available but go easy with it.  Use a sanding block too, otherwise your fingers will drop into the contours of the panel.</p>

<p>Get a bucket of luke warm water and put a TINY (like a drop or two) amount of washing up liquid in it.  Keep the sand paper very wet and keep wetting it.  If you go too hard on this you may go through the paint and back to the primer.</p>

<p>After this you can start using cutting compound (cutting paste) before finishing with a good wash, polish and wax.</p>

<p>In future, if you paint a ""wet line"" into the panel you can effectively paint shine in but if you put too much on you get runs which you also have to buff out so it's a case of practice, practice, practice.  I have to say it does look good for a first attempt though :-)</p>

If you get two tires with the same RPM, they will run down the road the same (for the most part) and not mess with your speedo/odometer. </p>

<p>That being said, If you have a tire which is too tall, it will affect your car by showing a slow speedometer, will (theoretically) give you a higher top speed, will require more torque to get your vehicle moving, and if driving in the city will cause you worse gas mileage (due to requiring more torque). </p>

<p>If your tire is too short, it will affect your car by showing a fast speedometer, will give you a lower top speed, will require less torque to get your vehicle moving, and will cause you worse gas mileage at highway speeds (due to having to run the engine at a higher speed to maintain the same speed). </p>

<p>As @Calyth stated in their comment, the difference between the two tire sizes is not a heck of a lot, but it may show a slight difference, depending on the actual RPM for each tire.</p>

Further inspection revealed a lot of rust in one particular area on the pipe. Thankfully the forward muffler is still intact so the car isnt that loud.</p>

<p>My question is: would it still be safe to drive (to go to the shop to get new parts) with the exhaust coming out underneath the car (break is somewhere underneath the boot/trunk)?</p>

<p>I may be a bit overly cautious but would heat from the open exhaust effect the fuel tank some how?  </p>
","<p>You will likely be annoyingly loud but otherwise fine.  As always, you are liable for your own compliance with local noise ordinances.</p>

<p>I would recommend that you drive with the windows up until you give the car to the shop in order to avoid any risk of carbon monoxide poisoning.  For example, don't drive with the trunk propped open: the low pressure behind the car will trap a bunch of exhaust back there and you don't want it coming into the car with you.</p>

<p>The risk is pretty low but you'll feel better if you're already concerned.</p>

<p>It's unlikely that the tank will notice any increase in temperature: it's used to being in the vicinity of hot metal carrying exhaust fumes.  Now it's just going to experience the fumes directly.</p>

<p><em>When I replaced my muffler some years back, I started the car with the muffler off and was seriously tempted to drive around making a huge racket without any concern about exhaust fumes.  My son convinced me that we'd get into too much trouble.  He did agree that it sounded glorious, though....</em></p>

"Can radiator cool down a car too much?","12378","","<p>Recently they replaced my stock radiator with aftermarket one (at dealership, so I hope they knew what they were doing), and since then I feel that a car is not warming up enough. </p>

<p>Even if I warm it up completely at garage - as soon as I start driving temperature drops. Driving at high speed drops it even more, when temperature outside is cold it gets worse too. I don't have precise temperature gauge though (only 4 digital bars on gauge) so I can't be sure.</p>

<p>This new radiator is smaller/thinner. Can a radiator be too ""good"" and cool down a car too much? Thermostat should completely disconnect radiator from the circuit if a car is cold, isn't it? </p>

<p>(at dealership they say it all behaves as it should, car is not over-cooling)</p>

<p>Car in question is Honda Prelude'92.</p>
","<p>If the thermostat is operating properly the radiator will only come into play when the thermostat opens, when the engine is at normal operating temperature (around 190 degrees, give or take).  Adding a gigantic radiator won't make a bit of difference because if the engine gets too cold, the thermostat will close, causing the engine to heat up again.</p>

<p>In the winter, the cabin heater will draw around 20% of the engine's heat in order to heat you. This will cause the car to heat up slightly slower, but once it's warm it will stay that way.</p>

<p>It's possible that the thermostat isn't fully closing when you are driving, but works ok at idle. You might consider getting a high quality thermostat and replacing the existing one. It's also possible that the coolant temp sensor is on it's way out..  </p>

<p>On the highway, a car produces lots of heat (at a higher RPM), which indicates to me that the thermostat is opening more (or failing to close properly) at higher RPMs since you are seeing a temp DEcrease at speed. Again, a new high quality thermostat should fix this.</p>

I'm not interested in trying to eek out a few extra miles on a tank, I want to keep the vehicle and its engine running as long as possible.

","<p>The problem is, the crossfire isn't just high compression, I believe its supercharged as well.  Forced induction motors like octane - the high pressure, high compression, and most importantly high combustion temperatures make you more prone to detonation.  </p>

"Bent front fork on a bike","12286","","<p>There's a previously owned <strong>2009 YAMAHA FZ16-S</strong> that I'm thinking of picking up. It has a slightly twisted and bent fork (plausibly caused by an accident). It's only apparent when you ride it for a bit. Upon pressing down hard on the front suspension, one can see faint amounts of oil on the fork legs (seal compromised?). I've taken it to a few mechanics who have confirmed this.<br>
I believe it can be fixed by taking it apart and straightening it with a <strong>hydraulic press</strong>.<br>
Though the cost of getting this done is measly, I've gotten varying opinions from different mechanics on the degree of success for this operation.<br>
The integrity of the frame and safety is paramount to me and I intend on riding this bike over long distances.<br>
I would like to know the details of the <strong>fork-straightening</strong> process (whether there are different approaches and procedures?) and general recommendations for carrying out this process/discern if it's beyond repair.  </p>
","<h1>Fork Straightening</h1>

<h1>Process</h1>

<ul>
<li>The slider and internal oil valving are removed.</li>
<li>The stanchion (inner fork tube) is placed on <a href=""http://its.foxvalleytech.com/MachShop3/images/mill/vblck2.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">v-blocks</a></li>
<li>A <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicator_%28distance_amplifying_instrument%29"" rel=""nofollow"">dial indicator</a> is used to detect deflection as the stanchion is rotated</li>
<li>Once deflection is understood a hydraulic press is used to bend the stanchion back to its original state.</li>
<li>The process of measurement and bending with the press is repeated until a minimum amount of deflection can be detected</li>
</ul>

<h1>Risk</h1>

<p>The stanchion has been repeatedly straitened has undergone enough stress cycles as to degrade the integrity of the tube.  This, obviously, is undesirable.  This can be detected by lubricating the tube slightly and running your hand up and down the tube to detect anomolies in the surface.  Any surface anomolies on the stanchion will result in ongoing fork seal issues.  As the fork seal passes by the surface anomoly it will quickly degrade the seal or allow oil to pass by resulting in oil leaks that can effect the brake rotor or tire surface which, in both cases, could prove to be a safety issue for the rider.</p>

<h1>Opinion</h1>

<p>I've personally straightened many stanchions at shops and at home with excellent results.  Another avenue for remediation is to simply replace the stanchion AND the plain bearings within the slider.</p>

","<p>Carbon Build up on the valves and the exhaust is very common for any old engine no matter how you maintain it , its the by product of the combustion of gasoline.</p>

<p>Issues due to carbon build-up on the valves:</p>

<ul>
<li>Clogs the valves thus allowing less fuel/air to get inside the cylinder thus reducing power and efficiency of the vehicle.</li>
<li>The above point can cause an uneven power stroke causing engine knock.</li>
<li>Since fuel is not properly burned it will increase the emissions and might fail pollution test.</li>
<li><p>The EGR or Exhaust Gas Recirculation will now be sending the bad exhaust into the engine. increasing the carbon build up further.</p>

<p>However carbon buildup is not something which affects only one parameter of a car, it can affect the air/fuel intake.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Abstracts from <a href=""http://audisrs.com/archive/effects-of-carbon-build-up__o_t__t_15813.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here </a>shows it affects additional parameters</p>

<p>The carbon contributes to abnormal combustion in several ways, but the most dramatic effect in a modern fuel injected engine is the ""sponge effect"". As the fuel mixture in the cylinder is compressed, the carbon has a tendency to absorb both oxygen and fuel. Once the ignition spark fires, the flame front normally spreads through the chamber, consuming the fuel and air, however, the carbon has a tendency to extinguish the flame front and stifle combustion. </p>

<p>This, combined with the fuel and air that was absorbed, results in poor efficiency. As the chamber decompresses during the exhaust portion of the stroke, the unburned fuel and air is released, resulting in both excessive fuel and air (containing oxygen) entering the exhaust system. The O2 sensor detects the excessive oxygen and the vehicle computer (ECM, ECU, PCM) compensates for this by enriching the mixture. </p>

","<p>I can't give you numbers or calculations without some work, but I can tell you than energy is never free.  Cars have an A/C compressor that is mechanically driven by the engine because this is the easiest way to get the job done in a typical consumer car.</p>

<p>An A/C compressor actually takes a huge amount of energy to operate.  In fact a central A/C unit for a house uses more electricity than anything else (in a hot climate).  If you want to electrically power the A/C that power needs to come from somewhere.</p>

<p>If you wanted to generate enough power to drive an electric compressor, the required alternator would take even more engine power than the mechanical compressor because of inefficiencies and losses.  If you wanted to use battery power, you would need very large batteries and a more powerful charging system.</p>

<p>The electric system would allow you to run soley from batteries in <em>important times</em>, but the engine management could just as easily turn off the mechanical A/C compressor at those times as well.

"Diesel vs Petrol motorcars. Pro's and cons?","12233","","<p>I realize this may be a silly question to those of you on here who are proper petrol-heads and this may even be a repeat question, but I could not find anything on it on here, so here goes:</p>

<p>What are the advantages and disadvantages between cars with petrol engines vs those with diesel engines?</p>

<p>I've heard people say things like diesel engines produce more raw power, but are slower to get there. As far as I know, diesel engines need to warm up the fuel using the glowlamps (I think that's what they're called) before ignition is possible. When I was a kid (grew up in South Africa) only the pickup trucks were diesel-powered and diesel used to be way cheaper back then.</p>

<p>I'm not interested in the inner workings of petrol vs. diesel engines, but more in what would be of relevance to an everyday buyer when choosing between diesel vs. petrol. I realize this question might be a bit broad, but I'm looking for differences one can expect (in general) between modern petrol- and diesel-powered motor cars.</p>
","<p>As an everyday buyer you won't be interested in the high performance end of diesel or petrol, so here goes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Diesel engines typically rev lower and have more low speed torque - so you are less likely to stall off the line, for example.</li>
<li>Petrol engines usually rev higher and get more power at 3-4 thousand revs</li>
<li>Diesel seems to be getting more expensive - especially in the US.</li>
<li>Diesel engines often run more efficiently - more miles per gallon (sometimes significantly more)</li>
<li>Diesel engines are noisier, although manufacturers are improving all the time.</li>
<li>In the UK you pay less emissions taxes on diesel engines, as the tax is heavily based on CO2, not particulates.</li>
</ul>

<p>So from a pure running cost perspective, diesel engines in cars are currently looking very good.</p>

"What is a governor and what is it used for?","12232","","<p>I was watching a classic car restoration program on YouTube in which they were working on a '50s Cadillac with an automatic transmission.</p>

<p>The mechanic in the video diagnosed a transmission glitch as a problem with the ""governor"" that was sticking due to the buildup of crud.</p>

<p>I don't see this part mentioned in the context of modern automatic transmissions.</p>

<p>What is the role of the governor in these all-mechanical transmissions and why are they not used in modern transmissions?</p>
","<p>Old automatic transmissions were shifted entirely using hydraulics, not electronics. For this operation the transmission would generate 3 pressures; line pressure, throttle pressure and governor pressure. </p>

<p>Line pressure is generated with the front pump of the transmission. It is used to actuate clutches and bands. </p>

<p>Throttle pressure is a derivative of line pressure. As the name implies throttle pressure is directly related to how far the throttle pedal is pushed. It's a derivative of line pressure because line pressure is tapped to generate it. The tap then goes to a valve which is connected to the throttle pedal. When the pedal is all the way up the valve is open and no pressure is generated. When the pedal is to the metal the valve is closed and the throttle pressure is at it's maximum. </p>

<p>Governor pressure is similar to throttle pressure in that it is a derivative of line pressure but it is generated relative to the speed of the vehicle. Normally the governor is in or near the tail shaft of the transmission. The governor has a set of fly weights (like centripetal advance in a distributor). As you drive faster the weights fly out more closing the valve and raising pressure. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5mbGU.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5mbGU.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Finally everything comes together. The transmission uses spool valves to shift. When at rest and not on the throttle the governor and throttle pressures are zero and the transmission is in firs gear. The spool valve is held in the first gear position with a spring. Now you take your foot off the break but don't hit the gas. The car will slowly speed up and the governor pressure will go up. When the governor pressure is high enough it will overcome the spring and slide the spool valve over turning off first gear and turning on second gear. </p>

<p>Now suppose that you are already moving in second gear and want to accelerate rapidly. You lay into the throttle pedal which causes the throttle pressure to climb. The spring pressure plus the throttle pressure is now great enough to overcome the governor pressure and slide the spool valve back to turn off second gear and turn of firs gear. You get a downshift. </p>

<p>Even with the engine being computer controlled the first piece of electronics that made it into the transmission is the torque converter clutch (TCC) solenoid. The TCC should only come on when the engine is warm and there is no good way to give that input to the transmission. Since the engine computer already knows the engine temperature, vehicle speed and throttle position it can activate the TCC. </p>

<p>While the engine drivability was constantly improving the transmission lacked something to be desired. The valve body (housing that contains the spool valves) constantly got more complicated with shuttle valves and accumulators and other things to improve the shift quality. Eventually all of the controls of the transmission become electronic. </p>

<p>With electronic controls the vehicle speed and throttle position is read into the computer (engine or transmission depending on the vehicle). The computer then decides when to shift. To shift, the computer activates solenoids to turn gears on and off. This greatly improved the quality of the shifts because the computer can keep track of how the transmission is shifting and then compensate for any shortcomings. The computer pulse width modulates the solenoids and by controlling the duty cycle can change the speed of the gear turning on. This can change how soft or stiff the shift is. Also by monitoring how quickly the gears engage the computer can choose when to turn the gear on. Chrysler calls this monitoring clutch volume index (CVI). </p>

","<p>There are three main possibilities that are on my mind for what your problem is:</p>

<p>1) The blower motor is going bad and just needs replacing. I'm not sure where the access to the blower motor is on your vehicle, but generally this is a fairly easy repair to do.</p>

<p>2) The blend door in the HVAC enclosure is sticking or the motor is being overdriven, producing a repeated ""clacking"" noise. This can often be remedied by turning the temperature control all the way to hot, waiting a few seconds for the sound to stop, and then turning the temperature back down to the desired cooling. Another possibility is to pull the fuse for this circuit, turn the ignition to on, wait a couple minutes, turn the ignition off, replace the fuse, and turn the ignition on. This may reset the circuit memory and fix the issue.</p>

<p>3) Animals. The blower motor housing on cars is a common refuge for rodent folk. You can usually tell if they've taken up living there from the smell though.</p>

<p>I would try the blend door first and if the sound doesn't go away from adjusting the temp to max on both ends of the spectrum, pull the blower motor and see if anything got inside the housing, or if the motor is going bad.</p>

The vehicle worked fine during this time, but I didn't know how much fuel there was.  About a month later I was driving up a slight hill and the vehicle stalled.  The electric still worked, but the power brakes and steering didn't.  I pulled over and the tried to start it and it turned over but didn't start.  After 5 minutes I tried again and it was fine.

<p>My wife is now afraid to drive without difinitive proof that the sensors caused the stall.  Any ideas?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
","<p>The sensor should not cause the engine to stall. All of the accessories not working (power steering and brakes) would be normal with a stalled engine. What I would be looking at is the fuel pump might be going bad. A mechanic can easily check this by placing a fuel pressure sensor on the fuel line to check the pressure. If the engine is losing fuel pressure, it would stall and would show up directly on the pressure gauge. If the engine is stalling as much as you say, it shouldn't take them long to figure out if this is the issue.</p>

<p>Even if the fuel pump is going out, this does not equate to the issues you are seeing with your fuel gauge. The are two different things, though the sensor is co-located with the pump in the fuel tank. </p>

<p>Check with your Hyundai dealer. If you bought this vehicle new, I <em>believe</em> it should still be under warranty considering what you have stated with vehicle age and mileage. </p>

<p>Unfortunately the brake pedal now feels spongy. The pedal feel was firm prior to the brake swap, so it is definitely a sudden change and not a gradual degradation of brake fluid.</p>

<p>One thing I forgot to do was undo the brake fluid reservoir cap before pushing the piston calipers back with a C-clamp, so I suspect that the the sponginess is due to trapped air in the system since the reservoir was never exposed to outside air.</p>

<p>Or is it possible that the extra pressurization of the system via the C-clamp resulted in moisture absorption? The only issue I see with this reasoning is that the system was never exposed to outside air.</p>
","<p>Two things to look for. </p>

<p>1) air in the brake fluid. </p>

<p>2) incorrectly assembled brake pads, especially the anti noise shims. </p>

<p>Air in the brake fluid is the most common cause of low, spongy brake pedal feel. Moisture in the fluid will not substantially change the pedal feel until the fluid temperature exceeds the boiling point of any water in the fluid, then the pedal feel gets very soft. Brake fluid absorbs water if exposed, so the systems are to remain sealed.  Brake fluid older than three years or any color other than that of tea should be flushed.</p>

<p>Improper assembly of the brakes can cause the pistons to be pushed back too far into their bores when the brakes are released. this cause a longer than normal stroke of the brake pedal before resistance is felt.</p>

<p>Also new brake pads installed without surfacing the rotors can result in more pedal effort required for normal braking.</p>

"Leaving car with automatic transmission in Neutral instead of Park","11983","","<p>Can we use Neutral (N on the selector) instead of Park (P) when parking on a flat surface?</p>

<p>Is this useful for transmission system? Because every time we put gear on P we must pass through R and will this reduce gearbox/clutch's life?</p>

<p>What is the mechanical difference between Park and Neutral? I think Park is basically neutral, but with a parking pin locks the wheels from moving... so when surface is flat we don't need that pin and using handbrake is enough.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>
","<p>Setting your car in Park does not cause wear of any kind, and most automatics I have driven will not start or let you remove the key in any other position than Park.</p>

<p>First of all, I'd like to point out that even if Reverse <em>did</em> fully engage, the wear on clutches and brake bands caused by it is about the same as each of the individual gear shifts your transmission made during your drive. You should not worry about how many times your transmission changes gears. Very heavy loads and aggressive driving are the real causes of increased wear on an automatic transmission.</p>

<p>Now, putting your vehicle in park will not cause any wear, because:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In a computer-controlled automatic transmission, the computer will only change gear if you stay in the gear for a while. Moving from Drive to Park, even relatively slowly, will not cause the transmission to even consider engaging Reverse.</p></li>
<li><p>On a fully hydraulic automatic transmission, Reverse will be engaged immediately, but this operation is so slow that if you move straight from Drive to Park in a direct motion, it simply won't have time to do anything, much less cause wear.</p></li>
<li><p>If the vehicle is turned off first, all gears will be stationary, so even if you fully engaged Reverse, there will be no wear on the clutches and brake bands of any kind.</p></li>
<li><p>The parking prawl and parking gear are quite massive chunks of steel, and their only wear is mild friction when engaging. Nothing short of intentional destructive behavior will cause noticeable wear on your parking prawl and gear.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I would also like to add that having a habit where you do not always engage park is probably a bad idea, as you risk forgetting to engage park when you really need to, instead of it being plain muscle memory. Even a well-serviced handbrake is much less capable than a parking gear, and handbrakes in automatics are usually <em>far</em> from well serviced (even if they're used, their reduced effectiveness is hidden by the parking gear).</p>

<p>Others add that engaging the handbrake prior to the parking gear may be a good idea in order to slightly reduce wear on parking gear and prawl, and ease parking gear disengagement (which can be hard when the parking gear is vehicle on a slope). The parking gear does <em>not</em> engage unless the vehicle moves slightly after being put in park, so in this configuration, it will only engage if the handbrake slips. I do not do this myself, as I see no reason to worry about parking prawl/gear wear, and would rather have certainty that the vehicle cannot move.</p>

"What's the meaning of a ""lean"" vs ""rich"" air fuel mixture","11955","","<p>I'm learning about vacuum leaks on engine intakes and I'm hearing this terminology of lean air fuel mixture. I thought I heard of a rich mixture before too. What's a normal mixture referred to as? A balanced mixture?</p>

<p>Also just for clarity, this terminology doesn't apply to anything else in the vehicle does it? Like I wouldn't hear someone speaking of lean/rich oil, or lean/rich battery acid or some other substance the car uses right?</p>
","<p>I do not know the etymology of these words or the history of their use in the context of air-fuel ratios, although their dictionary definitions (<a href=""http://www.dictionary.com/browse/lean"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">lean</a> [adj.], <a href=""http://www.dictionary.com/browse/rich"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">rich</a>, too bad I don't have an OED subscription) and usage in other contexts does parallel their usage here. I did some cursory research but gave up, the folks on <a href=""https://english.stackexchange.com/"">the English site</a> may be able to help there. However, answering your basic question:</p>

<p>The terms are relative in the same sense that ""dim"" and ""bright"" are relative:</p>

<ul>
<li>""Lean"" means a lower fuel-to-air ratio; that is, less fuel in the mix; compared to <em>something</em> context-dependent.</li>
<li>""Rich"" means a higher fuel-to-air ratio; that is, more fuel in the mix; compared to <em>something</em> context-dependent.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you say, ""the air-fuel mixture is rich"" (or ""too rich"", same thing), it is implied to mean that there is more fuel in the mix than there should be in whatever situation you are talking about.</p>

<p>Now, there's a commonly quoted stoichiometrically ideal ratio of 14.7 air:gasoline. ""Stoichiometrically"" meaning that 14.7 masses of air react with 1 mass of gasoline according to the chemical reaction equation. This is <em>often</em> the context. You can find an interesting discussion of the finer points of this number <a href=""https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/gasoline-stoichiometry-calculation.182862/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>, mostly centered on the definition of ""air"".</p>

<p>So in that sense, when speaking of gasoline, if you said the mixture was ""rich"" then it means the ratio is &lt; 14.7:1 air:gas, and if you say it's lean, you mean the ratio is > 14.7:1 air:gas.</p>

<p>But 14.7 isn't the magic number for other types of fuels, and may not be the magic number even for gasoline depending on other conditions in the engine. If you're talking about <em>those</em> situations, ""rich"" still means more than whatever amount of fuel is ideal for the given amount of air, and ""lean"" means less.</p>

<p>I guess if it was neither ""rich"" nor ""lean"" you'd call it... just right? </p>

<p>Still, I do not know why ""rich"" and ""lean"" were the chosen words for this, and wouldn't mind finding out, myself.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also just for clarity, this terminology doesn't apply to anything else in the vehicle does it? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have never heard it used in any other context. The words ""lean"" and ""rich"" are so strongly associated with the air-fuel ratio that if you told a mechanic that the battery acid was ""rich"" I suspect they would either wonder why you had gasoline in your battery acid, or why you were trying to build an engine that burned battery acid as a fuel, heh.</p>

"Is it okay to splice a backup camera into the reverse lights?","11941","","<p>I saw another thread that was similar, but it didn't a definitive or clear answer on the matter.</p>

<p>I'll be brief. I want to install a Nexus 7 (2012) tablet in the dash of my car. I want it to be able to display video from a backup camera that I will mount in the trunk of the car. The camera will just be a Logitech webcam that I already have, but it uses USB. This is fine, because I'll just use a USB OTG Y cable with the tablet so that I can charge it and send the video data to it as well.</p>

<p>So, I want the camera to automatically display the video on the tablet when I go in reverse, but I need a way to detect this. After some research, I've concluded that I should splice in the power cable from the USB directly to the wire to the reverse lights, connect the ground cable to the car chassis, and then just send the data wires up front to the tablet. </p>

<p>My question is, <strong>is it okay if I just splice the power wire from the USB directly into the reverse lights?</strong> That way, when the reverse lights go on, the camera goes on, and the video app launches. <strong>My concern is that I could either be drawing too much power from the reverse lights, or the reverse lights provide too much power to the camera, which takes 500mA, per the USB 2.0 specification.</strong></p>

<p>Also, if I were to do this, would I have to watch out whether I spliced the wire into a positive or negative wire for the reverse lights? Do those play some part in the switch that determines whether the lights are on or not?</p>

<p>Thanks for any input</p>
","<p>The short answer is that you can splice the camera into the reverse lights, as the current draw is minor. However, since the camera is USB, it is expecting 5V, and your reverse lights operate at 12V, so you will need to regulate the voltage. What you're looking for is a DC-DC converter, and if you look around eBay, you can find one that has USB connector at the output.</p>

<p>To clarify the current draw, the camera draws 500mA at 5V, but since your source is 12V, and accounting for some inefficiency in the conversion, your camera will draw closer to 250mA. Also, as this is often  misunderstood, even if you find a DC-DC converter rated for 3A, the camera will only draw what it needs. You just need to make sure the voltage output is 5V.</p>

"Fuel efficiency and Shifting/RPM","11939","","<p>I was reading a thread in a car forum where someone wrote: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The lower the RPM, the less fuel you use, the less strain you put on everything..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another person then replied, stating:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Not true. If your pulling high gears and making the engine work more
  to go how you want your using more gas. As well as putting more strain
  on the car. By wanting more from the car when it is out of its power
  your forcing the injectors to open more thus burning more gas. Please
  don't mislead anyone if your not sure. However, waiting until redline
  to shift isn't ideal either. Shifting at 3/4 or so of the torque curve
  is optimal for gas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Who is correct?</strong> Is it more gas efficient to to shift at lower RPMs rather than high RPM? Would something like this vary great from car to car, model to model, or would it be a general rule for all standard engines?</p>
","<p>I think you need to define your terms.  Efficiency could mean at least four things in this context:</p>

<ol>
<li>Least fuel consumed per hour.</li>
<li>Most mileage covered per unit of fuel.</li>
<li>Most kinetic energy created per unit of fuel consumed.</li>
<li>Most acceleration created per second.</li>
</ol>

<p>These four choices often destructively interfere with each other.  Hitting some of the high points of each of the above meanings:</p>

<ol>
<li>High gears usually mean lower revs meaning lower amounts of fuel injected on average.  The squirts of fuel might change in size depending on throttle position but those squirts happen less often.</li>
<li>Mileage per fuel units is a multivariate equation in which aerodynamic drag starts to dominate at higher highway speeds.  Even so, if you are driving very slowly, you will also see lower mileage than the optimum as you just aren't covering much linear distance.</li>
<li>Internal combustion engines almost always have a peak energy output point where they are best able to combine fuel and air and transform that into kinetic energy.  This is usually the torque peak of the engine.  Note: peak torque also means near peak fuel consumption per second.  Also remember that an engine's torque peak has nothing to do with the current gear selection.</li>
<li>Peak acceleration is likewise tied to the torque peak but also requires proper gear selection and involves aerodynamic and static drag factors.  Best acceleration from a stop will use the lowest gear.  At speed, low gears will not be a choice as you'd have to rev the engine past its physical limitations, which is one of the many reasons why your acceleration drops off as speed increases.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that all factors are more complicated than can be addressed in a single page.  For example, my turbo standard transmission car injects even more fuel than you'd expect at its torque peak.  The engine computer is using that extra fuel to cool the higher compression fuel-air mixture in order to avoid premature detonation.  This allows the car to run higher boost but isn't the greatest for fuel economy....</p>

"Why does my engine perform poorly and get bad gas mileage after using fuel injector cleaner?","11908","","<p>At the advice of someone at a local auto parts shop, I poured a bottle of fuel injector cleaner into my gas tank.  This happened around the same time that I had a brake job done and rotated my tires.</p>

<p>Within a week, I noticed that my engine is performing poorly.  It downshifts to climb small hills at freeway speed.  Also, the car is getting very poor gas mileage.  The car used to be able to get 400 miles on a single tank of gas and now I'm lucky if I can get 300, so there is a big reduction in gas mileage.</p>

<p>I took the car in to a shop.  I paid them almost $100 to tell me that the only problem they can see is that the tires are a little bit off-round.  I doubt that the tires not being perfect could be causing the problem, but there is a little bit of noise and vibration from the tires.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a technician at a shop I previously visited before this problem told me that he recommends a fuel induction service to restore the cars gas mileage and horsepower.</p>

<p>What can I do to make my car run better again?  It seems like something happened right around the time that I used the fuel injector cleaner product, but perhaps my brakes or tires have something to do with it.</p>

<p>I did notice a gradual drop-off in fuel economy over the previous two years, but it just took a total nosedive last week.</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> The car is a 2003 Acura 3.2TL.  I'll have to look into the brand of the fuel injector cleaner.</p>

<p>Also, Bob Cross asked about if the car's mileage was dropping before I had this problem.  Yes, it was dropping ever so slightly over the course of a few years, but it was right at the time that I put in the fuel injector cleaner that the fuel economy went way down.  The car has an EPA reported highway fuel economy of 27 MPG.  I drove about 230 miles last weekend at a speed of about 75 MPH and had to put in 11 gallons to refuel it.  I calculated the fuel economy to be less than 21 MPG.</p>

<p>All I know to say is that it seems as if the car is just ""working harder"" to maintain highway speed.</p>

<p><b>New Information:</b> I received a call from the service shop where the car is being examined.  The tech tells me that he drove the car down the street next to the shop (not going at highway speeds where I experienced serious problems) and it seemed to run fine for him.  He says that he connected the car to various diagnostic machines and there was no indication of any fault in the car.  However, he says that upon checking the spark plugs, he discovered that the plugs have heavy carbon build-up, so he recommends replacing the spark plugs and performing a fuel induction service.  Also, he says that the plugs in the car (which were installed several months ago) are iridium plugs and that the stock plugs would be double-platinum.</p>

","<p>You will generally want to look for something that is a solvent, or is solvent-based.</p>

<p>A good homebrew 'degreaser' would be using washing soda (sodium carbonate) diluted in water. You can make washing soda from baking soda by heating it (baking soda) up on a stove. There are plenty of videos and guides on how to safely to this.</p>

<p>But in terms of effectivity, you are better off buying citrus cleaner concentrate and diluting it in water or buying degreaser bottles. Heavy-duty degreaser on store shelves often contain alkaline washing agents and a few other chemicals that make them much, much more effective than anything you could easily make at home. If you are having unsatisfactory results with degreaser that you have bought before, you may have unrealistic expectations of what degreaser can do. It does not completely dissolve heavy dirt and grime build-up, you generally need to scrub down and/or use a pressure washer afterwards.</p>

<p>Regarding safety, solvents that are strong enough to aid in cleaning engines will always be mildly or considerably toxic to humans. Although many people will not wear mouth/nose protection when using degreasers or solvents, it is generally a good idea as prolonged exposure and inhalation of them can be detrimental to you.</p>

<p>In short, look up how to make washing soda, dilute it in water and use that. Have low expectations of how well it will clean compared to store-bought degreasers and solvents, and possibly go through a more involved process of cleaning out your engine. Wear mouth/nose protection if you can.</p>

<li>Because automatic gears can't read your mind and may not choose the best gear for what you want to do. </li>
<li>Because the greater complexity leads to more maintenance or more breakdowns. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why was this gear technology developed</strong></p>

It just means that in one way or another, you are hindering the engines ability to provide driving force, and in some applications you are actually using a device to work against the engine and vehicle.. There are several ways to do this and several reasons for it.</p>

<p>The most famous engine retarder is the <em>Jake Brake</em>. It was designed to open and close the exhaust valves very late to use the pressure from the engine in an attempt to retard the engine. This was done so that large machinery and semi trucks could come to a more quick and even stop. Rather than having to use and heat up their brakes while stopping or traveling downhill, this could be used instead.
Here is a video of what it sounds like and a video demonstrating it.

<p><strong>Retarding the ignition timing</strong></p>

<p>Retarding the ignition timing can be useful for a few things, but is generally left untouched. Reasons for doing this would be for non-computer managed fuel economy, a car that has minor forced induction and non-computer management, if the vehicle isn't performing as desired, and some engines will actually benefit and gain horsepower from retarded timing.</p>

<p><strong>Hydraulic retarders</strong></p>

<p>Hydraulic retarders are essentially the same design as a torque converter in the sense that they have small veins that hydraulic fluid passes through. HOWEVER they do the opposite, they help slow down the motion of the drive-train. The reason for these can vary greatly. I've seen small cars with them, and typically you see large machinery with them. They serve the same purpose, but are more robust and can do a much quieter and smoother job of slowing things down. These are usually switched on and there are secondary pumps that help assist the hydraulic fluid in stopping what ever it is that you're trying to stop. Generally you would find it just after your drive shaft, because it is usually a stand-alone unit.</p>

<p><strong>What can happen if you don't correctly retard the engine</strong></p>

<p>Depending on your method of retarding the engine, generally nothing catastrophic. Just lack of power and poor gas mileage. I'm saying this assuming you're not adjusting engine cams and things of that nature. Cylinders do not like flame. When you retard the timing without compensating for it, the combustion chamber will ignite late. This actually causes a ""fire"" inside the cylinder and probably lots of misfires. This will eventually eat away at your valves and cylinder walls. It can also cause the exhaust manifold to heat WAY up. </p>

<p>As far as for the other methods mentioned, those systems typically come on larger machinery and are installed by the factory. IF you tinker with it, it could actually be a huge problem. I've seen Caterpillar do testing on their engines and JUST the right amount will destroy the engine. Trust me, it's way worse than blowing up your Honda at the drag strip.</p>

"Uneven idle when my '93 Honda Accord's engine is cold","11576","","<p>When I start the engine cold in my '93 Honda Accord, it will rev up to 2000rpm and slowly go down to 800 rpm as the engine warms up (normal behavior), <strong>unless</strong> I do one of the following during this process:</p>

<ul>
<li>Touch my gas pedal</li>
<li>Move my steering wheel (power steering)</li>

My engine will still warm up and the revs will drop as normal, but they will still cycle to 1000rpm (up and down, up and down...) until the engine is warm (idles at 800rpm). I often get weird looks from people as I'm driving around, since it must sound like I'm the one reving my engine.</p>

<p>I took the car to a mechanic but they said it could be anything going wrong, since the computer is not throwing an error. I'm not sure if this is related, but in the dead of winter when it's &lt;10 F, my temperature gauge will barely go over the cold mark, even after hours on the highway (my interior blowers will pump out some heat). This behavior lessens as the ambient temperature goes above 40 F or so.</p>

"Could less than optimal battery charge prevent starter bendix drive from engaging flywheel?","11569","","<p>With a less than optimal 12.2 volts at the battery terminals and the bendix drive at the starter failing to pop and engage the flywheel, would battery charge be a likely cause of such a failure? Or would the fact that the starter motor runs, minus bendix action, conclude that the battery charge is <strong>not</strong> the cause; rather, the starter itself, such as a stuck bendix drive or worn brushes? </p>

<p>Note that the vehicle in question, a 1989 Town Car, has good continuity throughout the electrical system to the starter, and the solenoid is good.</p>
","<p>A less than optimal battery and a functioning solenoid you would <strong>at least</strong> get the bendix to actuate. The less than optimal battery, would not supply enough power to have the starter actually rotate the engine. </p>

<p>This is usually audiable with a quickly repeating clicking type noise and other times by one ""click"" <em>[and usually the driver cussing and pounding on the steering wheel finally ending his/her rant by resting their forehead on the top of the wheel]</em>.</p>

<p>If the starter is just simply free-wheeling <em>(spinning without first mating with the flywheel)</em> then you're looking at a starter replacement or rebuild, whichever you prefer.</p>

<p>Regardless while you're taking everything apart since you'll be disconnecting the battery anyways might as well check the water/acid level, top it off and give it a solid charge so it's good to go when you get it all put back together.</p>

"How can I put down stuck rear sunshade on a 2006 Mercedes E class?","11546","","<p>I have a 2006 Mercedes E-350 with an automatic rear sunshade; until a week ago the sunshade worked fine, but now it's stuck up and I can't get it to come down by any means.</p>

<p>The button to move the shade doesn't respond; I can hear a click in the back of the car but that's it; none of the other mechanical noises it makes when it comes down proper. I can't physically push it back down, even after loosening the arms a bit (I got it about 20% down before it stopped moving). Even after loosening the arm's position the button doesn't work, though on occasion I've heard <em>slightly</em> more mechanical noises after pressing the button.</p>

<p>I've tried several tricks Mercedes forums recommend; I had someone push down on the shade while I press the button; no luck, it doesn't move. I heard the problem might be caused by a blown fuse, but I don't know which fuse it would be or how to get to the front fuse-box, actually; I can't seem to access the driver's side primary one if it's in there. I can see the rear fuse box but can't seem to open it.</p>

<p>At this point I don't really care if the sun shade comes back up but I want it down; I'm content to not use it again if it's not going to work. At the same time I'd rather not <em>break</em> it, at least not more than it already is, because the mechanism allegedly costs something around $1500.</p>
","<p>Took her in to s Mercedes licensed mechanic, they took apart the assembly. Turns out the Up motor worked fine, but the Down motor was burt out.</p>

<p>It's <em>possible</em> a similar situation could be caused by something as simple as a blown fuse or a misalignment of the ""scissor"" bars that raise/lower the shade, but that wasn't the case here. </p>

<p>Since it was the dead motor and not something simple they'd have had to replace <em>the entire assembly</em> which costs $1700. They're expensive because no one bothers to replace them, most places won't have them in stock.

"Oil in air intake: is this a faulty breather valve or by design?","11506","","<p>I noticed the other day that a component (breather valve) was not fitted properly (the clip that held the valve cover breather in place was sitting between the O-ring and the lip, instead of fastening the component to the top of the engine) and since have been trying to learn more about the PCV system in my car.</p>

<p>When I removed the valve I saw that there was a fair amount of oil in the pipe running from the air intake.</p>

<p>Alternatively, there is the (very high) possibility I've misunderstood the PCV system in this car and in fact that valve is the channel through which the blow-by enters the intake manifold in which case it would be expected that it was filled with oil.</p>

<p>I have a GPS device (or a cell phone cradle) in the corner of the windshield. I need to run a USB cable there to provide power to the device. I have a simple USB power plug for the lighter socket, and a black USB cable that is long enough to cover the distance while following the bends and curves of the dashboard -- so it's not a clothesline strung straight through the car. It <em>can be</em> neat and tidy along some ridges and edges, if I find a way to do it. <strong>How do I affix the cable to the dashboard in a reasonably simple yet elegant way?</strong></p>

<p>Here's where I plan to have the cable (orange) from the charger (red) to the device (green). There are some seams here where plastic parts meet. I can't stuff the cable into the seam but perhaps I could stick some kind of clip into the seam to hold the cable in place along the outside of this seam?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hrZeo.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I guess I could hot-glue the cable in place, but that would be hideous and also hard to remove. I asked my local car shop if they had some black cable clips or something self-adhesive, but they don't. They could only offer me some black masking tape to use. The shop told me that enthusiasts (who put all kinds of electricals everywhere in their cars) can disassemble the dashboard and run the cables internally. But I'm just a regular guy that doesn't want to dismantle my car :-) I don't want to end up with <a href=""http://s755.beta.photobucket.com/user/J1MMCD/media/Stripped_Dash.jpg.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">something like this</a>.</p>
","<p>I would take a different route. </p>

<ol>
<li>Starting at your end point (the green dot) put the connector on the dash where you want it. </li>
<li>Run the cable next to the front vent glass. Push the cable down the crack between the glass and the dash. </li>
<li>Open the door. There is usually room to run small cable down the left side. Sometimes you can tuck a single cable under the weather striping.</li>
<li>Look for a seam in the trim to make a transition under the dash.</li>
<li>Run the cable under dash along any existing harness to the center console.</li>
<li>At the center console run the cable down the back.</li>
<li>Once you reach the floor take the route you have already diagrammed. The plastic housing around the gear select will usually have some give and press into the carpet. Just push the cable under the housing.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once the cable is ran use zip ties to secure it in place. There are some zip ties with sticky pads on them that you can use behind the A/C control area. You shouldn't have to remove anything major. Making the transition from the door jam to under the dash will be the only tricky part.</p>

<p>Just keep in mind that you do not want to run the cable in the way of anything that moves.</p>

<p>Is it just for weight reduction, are they redundant or is there another (major) reason?</p>
","<p>For the most part, they don't need it. The purpose of the air bag is to protect the occupant as the body is thrown forward in a crash. Most racers have such vastly improved safety equipment over what is available in a standard road worthy automobile, they don't need air bags. </p>

<p>The things you'd need to take into account are things like a five-point harness, which pretty much holds the driver in the seat and does not allow him to shift forward, even in a crash. A standard automobile has a 3-point harness, which keeps the body in place for the most part, but is no where as efficient as a 5-point is. </p>

<p>Most racers also use what's called a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HANS_device"" rel=""nofollow"">HANS Device</a>. This keeps the head in place during a crash, alleviating any strain on the neck during a high speed incident. </p>

","<p>As @dodgethesteamroller stated, there is nothing wrong with reusing the engine oil. There are two caveats and one concern I'd like to mention with this. </p>

<p>First, use a clean container to store the oil in while you are doing your engine work. Your normal engine drain pan will probably not give you the cleanliness you are looking for. You <strong>DO NOT</strong> want to have the dirt and crud which collects in the pan to be put into your engine.</p>

<p>Second, it's probably a good idea to change out the oil filter when you are doing this. It doesn't hurt anything and should only cost you a few dollars to replace.</p>

<p>Concern: Before you decide you are going to reuse your nearly new engine oil, you need to realize the reasons for doing the work on the engine in the first place. If you are replacing worn bearings, you don't want to reuse your engine oil no matter how new it is, because it will more than likely have metal fragments from the old bearings in it ... no sense in putting metal particles back into your engine and having all those wear items thrown into the mix. It just does not make sense.</p>

"Is it a good idea to have MOT and Full service at the same time?","11188","","<p>Or is it better if we do them in two different places?</p>

<p>MOT Test = Ministry of Transport Test - an annual test carried out on vehicles over 3yrs old in the UK to ensure they are roadworthy (i.e. safe and meet emission standards)</p>
","<p>It depends how much you trust your garage!</p>

<p>If you want a 'proper' by-the-book MOT, the best places to go can often be council-run MOT centres. These are run for their own benefit (i.e. to test municipal vehicles), and don't offer any other services, so they are less inclined to try and con you out of other work like some less scrupulous garages have been known to do. </p>

<p>As Graeme says, some garages will offer you a discount if you get a service done at the same time as the test, but I am always wary of places that offer such things too cheaply. I have heard stories of cars coming back from a service in a worse state than they went (e.g. not changing the oil or filter on the basis that many customers wouldn't know the difference between new and old).</p>

<p>My advice would be to find a small, local, reliable garage (ask around your friend/neighbours/colleagues for recommendations) and build up a rapport with them. They might charge a bit more than a big chain (typically they will charge full price for the MOT for example, but will usually be a lot cheaper than a dealer for labour), but they will give you a much better service. As an example, I've had testers look over the car before starting the official test and point things out to me, or adjust things like headlamp aim, that would otherwise have failed the test. Especially useful when you have a lamp fail on the way to the test!</p>

<p>As for timings, I tend to have each done when it is needed. If they happen to coincide, so be it, otherwise I'll do them separately. Admittedly, I tend to do most of my servicing myself (much cheaper!), so arranging garage appointments is less of an issue. I find the cost of the MOT is fairly minimal compared to the other costs of motoring, so spacing that out isn't as important - Unless, of course, a lot of work is needed! It is good practice to make sure that the MOT isn't due at the same time as the tax however, as you'll inevitably end up rushing to get it done to get the paperwork in place!</p>

All speeds were available and it was blowing cold air before the malfunction.  It was blowing fine, shutdown, sat overnight, and the blower would not come on after it was started the next day.  This vehicle is equipped with the temperature control option for the climate controls.  </p>

<p>I've checked the fuses and relays, they're good.  The fuses are intact and the relay was swapped with a known good unit.  </p>

<p>Is there anything else to check before getting out the multimeter?  I'd suspect the blower resistor, except the fan is not even working on high.  </p>

<p><strong>Update 1</strong></p>

<p>I've been cruising the forums, sounds like it might be the fan controller (present when equipped with automatic temperature control, in the same location the resistor would be otherwise).  It's under the hood on the passenger side, on the firewall under two heater hoses which have to come off to get at it, to the right of the blower motor itself if you're facing towards the rear of the vehicle.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong></p>

<p>There was no ground on the blower motor connector, which indicated a bad blower speed control module.  Module replaced with the redesigned part.  Blower now works.  </p>
","<p>It seems highly likely that it's the Blower Motor Speed Controller.  It's a known problem on the last couple generations of this platform and a redesigned part has been issued (8W7Z-19E624-A).  It's possible that it's just a bad blower motor, or both the blower motor and controller could be bad.  Good info <a href=""http://www.sparkys-answers.com/2009/10/2002-mercury-grand-marquis-blower-inop.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.  The blower motor and the controller are in the engine bay on the passenger side of the firewall.  The blower motor connector should have power on the brown-orange wire.  The orange-red wire is the ground.  If they're both good, it's a bad blower motor.  If there is no ground, it's time to check the controller.  The darn thing is so hard to get to, though, you might as well just go ahead and replace it if the blower motor is good.  Especially if the redesigned part has not already been installed.  I don't think it was even available until 2009 or later.  Replacing it involves clamping off the heater hoses it's under and getting them out of the way.  It's held in by two 8mm screws.  If you're incredibly lucky, persistent or perhaps gifted, you might be able to get it out without undoing the hoses, but the guy that's been doing this for years says he can't always do it without getting at least one of the hoses off.  If you're determined to test it with a multimeter before swapping it, you can get at the connecter if you get the EVAP solenoid out of the way.  </p>

<p>Another possibility is that the oil is leaking most or all of the time, but is pooling on something under the engine (such as the plastic undertray often fitted to cars of that age), then running off when the car is parked facing uphill.</p>

<p>I'm afraid the best way to tell is by getting dirty! If you have access to jacks and stands, park on solid, level ground and jack the front of the car. Support it properly with stands, then slide underneath and see if you can identify where the oil is coming from...</p>

The engine is a 4.6L V8 with the 4 speed automatic transmission, all original components as far as I know. The serpentine belt is brand new. No drivability problems, no CEL, with a mode 6 scan tool I do get a code for the EGR being open too much.</p>

<p>The squeak is never there on a cold engine. If it is under &lt;50 F outside it never squeaks no matter what the engine temp is. If the ambient temp is > 50 F it starts making the noise once the engine temp gauge moves to the normal range. I've looked under the hood while idling and the none of the pulleys are wobbling and the tensioner doesn't jump when you open the throttle.</p>
","<p>I figured it out today. The spark plug in one of the cylinders blew out of the head while driving. The 'squeaking' was actually a whistling as air was pushed passed the spark plug.</p>

"How Does a Quick Shifter work in a motorcycle","11065","","<p>I have often seen motorcycles like the BMW S100RR and the famous Ducati Panigale with Quick Shifter technology which allows seamless gear changes.</p>

<p>I want to know how these things work mechanically and are there any advantages or disadvantages of the tech.</p>
","<h2>Why the Quick-Shifter?</h2>

<p>Since these are called quick-shifters we'll dub slow-shifting the traditional way of shifting gear. When you slow-shift you usually close the throttle, disengage the clutch, act on the gear shifting pedal, engage the clutch and reopen the throttle. Now, this is a time-consuming process (<a href=""https://rideapart.com/articles/how-do-motorcycle-quick-shifters-work"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a few hundreds of milliseconds</a>) which might be undesirable in a racing environment where every fraction of a second counts. Enters: the quick-shifter. </p>

<h2>How Does it Work?</h2>

<p>There are many types of quick-shifters out there and not all use the same methods although they all aim at achieving a common goal: reduce load on the drive-train to safely engage a higher gear without damaging the gearbox. The way this is done is usually by momentarily cutting fuel and/or ignition for <a href=""https://rideapart.com/articles/how-do-motorcycle-quick-shifters-work"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a few tens of milliseconds</a> during which the gear is engaged. All of this happens without the need to close the throttle.</p>

<p>Just to give you an idea of how fast a quick-shifter can operate, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Woy1DnsreAs"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">see this video of a quick-shifting ZX10</a>.</p>

<p>The quick-shifter is usually a sensor reading the position of the shifter, informing a microcontroller of when up-shifting takes place in order for the controller to cut the fuel/ignition. It looks something like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XRMmX.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XRMmX.jpg"" alt=""Quick-shifter on a ZX10""></a> <br />
<sup><em>Image courtesy of <a href=""http://www.kawiforums.com/2005-2006-zx-6r/130128-dynojet-quick-shifter-mps-quick-shifter.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kawi Forums</a></em></sup></p>

<p>A quick-shifter circuit typically looks like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fNGDC.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fNGDC.jpg"" alt=""SP quickshifter""></a> <br />
<sup><em>Image courtesy of <a href=""http://i44.tinypic.com/21eu4g5.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">R6ers</a></em></sup></p>

<p>In this case you have one cable for each sparkplug which suggests that this unit cuts the ignition when quick-shifting.</p>

<h2>Is Quick-Shifting Harmful for the Gearbox?</h2>

<p>The general consensus on the internet seems to be that quick-shifting can be less harmful for the gearbox than slow-shifting since the engine power is guaranteed to be lowered when the fuel/ignition are cut. Whereas an unskilled driver manually operating the clutch is more likely to make the mistake of leaving the throttle open during up-shifting.</p>

"My vents randomly switch between face / windshield... how do I fix this?","11033","","<p>I have a 1998 Ford Windstar (more details on demand if necessary.)  I rarely use any vent setting besides ""face"", and I try to avoid using AC because my gas mileage is already lousy.</p>

<p>About two months ago, my vent / fan started blowing on the windshield instead of my face - I'd have to turn the fan all the way up to get a breeze I could even feel.  Once I'd been driving for a while, especially on the freeway, it would suddenly switch back to ""face"", and I'd have to turn the fan back down.  Get to my destination, park, leave the car... come back and do it all over again.  Irritating, but I can live with it.</p>

<p>Today, however, it was over 100, and I turned on the AC... and suddenly started hearing some ominous cracking noises from the windshield.  Wasn't feeling any air on my face, either... and I realized that the AC was blowing full cold on the inside of a hot windshield.  I turned it off in a hurry.  A little while later the vent finally switched itself to ""face"" (blowing hot air), and I figured it would be safe to start the AC again.  And it was - for about a minute, until it suddenly switched back to the windshield and I heard cracking noises again.  I turned it off in a hurry again, and proceeded for the rest of the day with the windows rolled down.  This is going to be a long summer...</p>

<p>Anybody have any ideas what the problem might be?  Electrical / vacuum / hydraulic, etc.?  And is this a doable DIY fix, or...</p>
","<p>The blend air doors on the Windstar are vacuum controlled. The default position is defrost (windshield vents), meaning that if you loose vacuum supply it changes to defrost position.  </p>

<p>Look for a vacuum hose going through the firewall and trace it to where it hooks up to the intake manifold. It goes through a one way check valve and it teed into a vacuum canister. Do a visual inspection on all the vacuum hoses connecting the items above, looking for holes etc. You also might have a pinhole in the diaphragm in one of the actuators. A vacuum pump like this <a href=""http://www.mityvac.com/pages/products_hvpk.asp"" rel=""noreferrer"">one</a> pictured below can be helpful in finding the problem. You don't really need all accessories, a standard mityvac can be bought for around $30. </p>

<p>I am not sure about the cracking, but the AC blowing on a hot windshield should not damage it. Is it possible the cracking noise is coming from under the hood?</p>

<p>Below is a diagram of the vacuum harness, to give you an idea of how the system works. Most of this is under the dash, except for the vacuum canister (#6) and the check valve (#7)</p>

"What is a head?","10995","","<p>Due to <a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/24683/what-exactly-is-a-head-gasket"">this question</a> I now have a fairly well-rounded understanding of what a head gasket is. I assumed that sometimes, when people would talk about ""heads"" that this was just an abbreviation of another term ""head gaskets"". Apparently, this is not the case!</p>

<p><strong><em>What exactly are heads?</em></strong></p>

<p><em>Clarification:</em> Car heads, not human ones...</p>
","<p><strong>tl dr:</strong> Cylinder heads (commonly just called ""heads"") are the big piece of metal which caps and seals the end of the cylinder bore.</p>

<h1>Types of Cylinder Heads:</h1>

<p>There are three basic types of cylinder heads: </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Flathead Cylinder Head</strong> - These cylinder heads were used on older engines such as the flat-head Ford engines (like seen below). The oval protrusion at the top of the cylinder head is for coolant flow. Coolant would flow up from the block and through passages in the head (between bolt holes) and out through this oval port at the top.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8KRsf.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8KRsf.jpg"" alt=""![enter image description here""></a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Overhead Valve Head (OHV)</strong> - This type of cylinder head has been used extensively from the 1950s and are still used today. These heads have the valves located within them instead of in the block like the flathead. The valves are actuated indirectly from the cam through a valve train, which usually consists of lifters (tappets), push rods, and rocker arms. An OHV head usually looks something like these Chevrolet heads below. In the picture, the flat surface of the head (right side of the image) is the portion which faces the engine block. The left side is where you see the valve tips, valve springs, retainers, and keepers. On top of these is where you would see the rocker arms if they were installed.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fwumz.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fwumz.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Overhead Cam Head (OHC)</strong> - This third type of head usually has the camshaft co-located with the cam. It is called ""over head"", because the cam actually resides over the top of the head. The OHC can have a single (SOHC) or dual (DOHC) configuration. (You can learn more about the differences between a SOHC and DOHC <a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/a/8137/4152"">in this SE post</a>). Here are some images showing OHC heads:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/f7O1t.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/f7O1t.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>In this image, it is a little hard to see, but there is one camshaft (you can see the single gear to the left of the head) which extends the length of the head. This single cam shaft actuates both the intake and exhaust valves which are in the head. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/j7qU9.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/j7qU9.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>In this image of a DOHC, you can see the two cam shafts (find two gears to the right of the head in the image). with DOHC, the valves can be actuated directly (as in this image) or with the use of rocker arms. </p></li>
</ul>

<h1>Anatomy of a Cylinder Head</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>First let's explain the Flathead Cylinder head a little. Like I said before, it is basically just a flat chunk of metal which seals the top of the cylinder. In the image above, the top portion of the image (as I stated) is the flat part. The indentations in the head (the almost heart shaped portion) is the combustion chamber. This is where the air fuel mixture has room to burn when the piston is at top dead center (TDC) during ignition, between the compression and power cycles of an Otto cycle engine. </p></li>
<li><p>To better understand what makes up most other cylinder heads, let's go over some of the basics (Note: some of these things were mentioned above, but I'll explain better as to what they are here):</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bare Cylinder Head</strong>: This is the main building block of the entire structure. All other components we'll talk about are attached to the bare head in some form or fasion.</p></li>
<li><strong>Valve</strong>: Usually buried inside the head, this is the part which lets the air/fuel mixture into the combustion chamber and the exhaust gasses out during that portion of the Otto cycle. The valve is actuated at the precise time by the cam shaft. Here is a representative image of a valve:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5rK8N.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5rK8N.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></li>
<li><strong>Valve Spring</strong>: This keeps the valve closed when it's not open. Valve springs can be comprised of one, two, or even three different spring portions (depending on the design need). Usually only very high performance engines need the spring pressures involved with three (or triple) springs. Here is a representative image of a valve spring (these are beehive springs, so called due to their shape):
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/EBGvB.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/EBGvB.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></li>
<li><p><strong>Valve Spring Retainer</strong>: The valve spring retainer keeps the spring located on the spring. The retainer is located on the top end of the spring (away from the head). It holds the spring in place while simultaneously attaches to the valve via retainer locks (see below). Here is a representative image of a retainer:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aQ7Dl.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aQ7Dl.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Retainer Lock</strong>: The retainer lock (or key) is wedged between the valve tip and the retainer. An interference fit occurs because of the spring pressure pushing up on the lock, the angle of the locks in relationship to the straight stem of the valve, and the small tab which fits into the valve. Here is a representative image of a retainer lock:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3Rvdx.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3Rvdx.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>This is one half of a pair of locks. You can also see the angle which is created, along with the small tab which connects the lock to the valve stem.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Valve Seal</strong> - The valve seal is located around the stem of the valve at the top of the valve guide (see below) underneath the valve spring. It provides a seal so as to prevent oil from leaking (or getting pumped) into the intake and exhaust tracts. Here is a representative image of a valve seal:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/j1Ctj.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/j1Ctj.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>In the image, you can see two valves (at bottom right and to the left). The valve seal is the spring which encircles the valve, the polymer piece underneath of it, and the metal which is below that. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Valve Guide</strong>: The valve guide does exactly what the name implies - it guides the valve. The valve guide is a separate piece of metal usually made out of cast iron or bronze. The guide is separate from the head so as it can be replaced if needed when a head is rebuilt. It is driven into the head and provides a way to keep the valve specifically located while still allowing the valve to move up and down during the open/close cycle. There are many different types and different applications for each. Here is a representative image of different valve guides:</li>
</ul>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/EzgRA.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/EzgRA.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Valve Seat</strong>: The valve seat is a hardened material which is hammered into the head, then cut at specific angles to, along with the valve, create a seal which keeps the gasses during the combustion process locked into the combustion chamber. Valve seats are usually made of some type of iron alloy as this tends to stand up to the rigors of an opening/closing valve over its lifetime. You can find seats in cast iron heads (most of the time), but you'll always find valve seats in aluminum heads. Without these, the valve would move the aluminum out of the way and would soon be damaged. Here is a representative image of a valve seat:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pEpHo.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pEpHo.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>In the image, I've added two yellow ovals. The valve seat is located between the two ovals. The seat is the portion which is discolored and looks to be machined at an angle. When the seats are place, a place is machined into the head where the seat will later be driven into it. Then the seat is cut at specific angles so the valve will make perfect contact with the seat and create a positive seal. You can also see in the image, at the center of the circles, is the valve guide peaking out at you.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Spring Seat</strong>: Depending on the head manufacturer and the head design, there may also be a spring seat, which can protect the cylinder head from being galled by the spring. As you may have guessed, the spring seat straddles the valve guide and is placed between the spring and the head. You'll usually see these on aluminum heads. In this area, a manufacturer can also place valve spring shims to set the spring height correctly.</p>

<p>Here is an image of most of the parts described above and how they all fit together (blown apart, of course):</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QNCmT.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QNCmT.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Combustion Chamber</strong>: The combustion chamber is where all the action occurs. The shape of this, in addition to the valves and dome (or dish) of the piston, shapes how the flame front travels after air/fuel ignition occurs. A combustion chamber can be of many different sizes and shapes. It all depends on what is needed for the particular engine. Below is a representative image of a big block Chevy (BBC) closed port combustion chamber. In the image, you see the face of the intake (larger valve) and exhaust (smaller valve) valves. Just to the right side of the valves (at 4 O'Clock to the valves) is a threaded hole. This is where the spark plug protrudes from. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Skz1W.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Skz1W.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Here is a <em>very</em> basic OHV head. You can see the different parts of the head annotated for better understanding. All head with valves in them work <em>fairly</em> much the same way, but can be arranged in different ways as you've seen in the above images. Here is another image showing the cross section of how the valves, intake runner and exhaust runner may be situated within the head:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/c2q1a.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/c2q1a.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Intake/Exhaust Ports</strong>: The intake and exhaust ports are the part of the head which allows the air/fuel mixture to enter the cylinder and the exhaust gasses to leave the cylinder. The size, shape, and texture of these can help or hinder how the air flow occurs. With greater flow comes greater power and torque. Here is representative image of a cutaway view of a port:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1hZgt.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1hZgt.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Extra Bits &amp; Pieces</strong>: During the casting of heads, coolant passages are built into them. This allows the head to bleed off excess heat from the combustion process. </p></li>

<p>Recent Civics got an AUX IN (audio Auxiliary in) port where you can plug it in. This is normally on driver's side, bottom of the dash.</p>

<p>Otherwise you'll have to buy an extension panel (I'm not sure this is the 'official name for it') which replaces your CD changer. What it does it, simply connects to the audio channel your CD changer uses to connect to the sound system in the vehicle and send signals coming from your phone.</p>

"Why do head gaskets fail in diesel engines?","10950","","<p>I'm considering the purchase of a 2001 VW Golf TDI ""mechanic's special"", so named because it apparently has a failed head gasket (white smoke).  I'm not a mechanic but I'm fairly handy with tools and figure I could probably fix it.</p>

<p>My concern is that head gaskets are not the kinds of things that just fail for no reason, and that this one might be the result of some problem that has done other damage to the engine or other parts of the car.  So I'm wondering what the likely causes of head gasket failure might be, and what other damage those might have caused.  </p>

<p>Bonus points for indicators of these problems that can be seen without splitting the engine first.  :)</p>

<p>Edit: 225,000km (140,000 mi), if that makes a difference.</p>
","<p>By far the most common cause of failure of the gasket is overheating.</p>

<li>water pump</li>
<li>radiator</li>
<li>pipes </li>
</ul>

<p>Also check for oil leaks or low oil - these can have knock on overheating effects.</p>

<p>Check your radiator isn't full of sludge - that could be a cause of the problem, or it could get filled with sludge as a result of the gasket failure.</p>

<p>Some gaskets are just badly made or fitted, so check these as well.</p>

"Why might I experience a power falloff after starting my car with the AC On?","10913","","<p>I have a 2000 Chrysler Neon which generally runs well.</p>

<p>I have noticed that if I start the vehicle, turn the AC on and reverse out of the driveway, the engine seems to struggle/sounds like it is going to stall.</p>

<p>If the AC is off the whole time, there is no struggling/stalling behaviour.</p>

<p>Once the vehicle is running, I can turn the AC to full without this symptom, but it still feels a little less responsive.</p>

<p>To give me an idea of where to start, what sorts of problems could cause these symptoms?</p>

<p>Could it be an issue with the battery, since presumably it would be at its weakest immediately after starting?</p>
","<p>Air Conditioners are run by a belt that is connected to the crankshaft.  The engine turning causes the A/C Compressor to move.</p>

<p>When your A/C is not turned on, a clutch disengages the A/C Compressor's internals from the pulley on the belt.  This allows that belt to free spin, not adding load onto the engine.</p>

<p>When the A/C is turned on, that clutch is engaged and so the internals of the A/C Compressor are driven, this does add load to the engine.</p>

<p>If this is a new symptom, then it is a sign that the compressor is adding more load to the engine then it used to and could be signs of a failing compressor, the pulley starting to seize, need for lubrication, etc.</p>

<p>If it has always been this way and you are just curious as to why, it is simply additional strain being put on your engine by the A/C.</p>

<p>A/C systems impact the performance of all engines, however the smaller and less powerful the engine, the more impact is going to be noticed as the A/C systems are not proportional to the engine, they are proportional to the interior cabin space.</p>

<p>Take a vehicle that has a 4 cylinder and 6 cylinder engine option, the A/C unit is going to be the same as there is the same interior space to cool.  However, you are going to notice the power impact far less on the V6 as it will be a smaller % reduction of power.</p>

"After brake bleed, pedal goes to floor","10852","","<p>2005 Toyota sequoia. Brake pedal was fine most of the time but occasionally it would sink to the floor while stopping and it would be hard to stop. I bled my brakes and now the pedal goes to the floor all the time with little stopping power. My auto shop teacher says I need a new master cylinder, but it was fine before bleeding the brakes. Also the brake light on the dashboard came on. Any ideas? Thank you.</p>
","<p>You need to completely rebleed your system. You obviously have air in it. If you have a power bleeder which fits the master cylinder, the better.</p>

<p>For future reference:</p>

<p><strong><em>DO NOT BLEED THE BRAKING SYSTEM BY REMOVING ALL THE BRAKE FLUID FIRST!!!</em></strong> </p>

<p>I apologize for yelling at you, but this is <em>absolutely</em> the wrong way to go about bleeding the system. <strong>The idea is to replace the old fluid as you are putting new fluid into the system</strong>. You run the old fluid out until it runs clear. As you've discovered it will cause you all kinds of issues. It may be very hard to bleed all of the air out of the system, but you need to bleed it sooner rather than later. If you don't have a power bleeder, use a friend to pump the brakes for you. Please do the following to general steps:</p>

<p>What you'll need:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <em>brand new</em> (never opened) bottle of brake fluid (per your vehicle specs) ... in your case, you may need two to completely redo the job</li>
<li>A wrench (spanner) to open the bleeder valve (usually a 5/16"" boxed end)</li>
<li>A clear plastic bottle to drain the fluid into</li>
<li>A piece of plastic tubing like you'd find for fish tanks</li>
<li>A friend with big burly quad muscles who can hear and follow direction</li>
</ul>

<p>What you do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open your bottle of NEW brake fluid and pour about an inch worth in the bottom of the clear container</li>
<li>Pop the top on the master cylinder; ensure it is full; leave the top off (you need to check it often as you go through the process)</li>
<li>Start your process at the brake cylinder/caliper which is farthest away from the master cylinder</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you need to jack the car up or take the wheel off, ensure you put the vehicle on a jack stand so you do not endanger yourself.</p>

<ul>
<li>At the caliper/cylinder, put the boxed end of your wrench on the bleeder valve. Use the wrench to loosen it slightly without allowing any air to seep in ... all you are looking to do is break the valve free.</li>
<li>With the wrench still on the valve, affix one end of the plastic tubing over the bleeder nipple, while placing the other end into the bottle so it is submerged into the fluid.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The reason you put the extra brake fluid into the bottom of the bottle and then submerge the end of the plastic tubing into it is, just in case you and your fiend do not communicate correctly and they lift the brake pedal too soon, the tube will draw the fluid up into itself instead of sucking air. This is <em>very</em> important so you don't have to start all over again.</p>

<ul>
<li>Have your friend pump up the brakes as best as they can. When they've pumped two or three or four times, make sure they know to hold the pedal down until you tell them to pump it up again.</li>
<li>Open the bleeder valve and observe the fluid as it's going through the tube and into the bottle. You are looking for two things: first, clear fluid; two, lack of air bubbles. In your case, until you see a big gaggle of air bubbles come through the tube, you need to keep going through the process of bleeding the particular caliper/cylinder.</li>
<li>Close the bleeder valve and then tell your friend to pump the brake pedal again. Keep going through this until the lack of bubbles can be seen. This is going to take several iterations to accomplish, but after the first one, it should be quite a bit less on the second wheel.</li>
</ul>

<p>For a left hand drive vehicle (like most found in the US), the order of brakes bleeding will usually follow this order:</p>

<ul>
<li>Passenger (right) side rear</li>
<li>Driver (left) side rear</li>
<li>Passenger (right) side front</li>
<li>Driver (left) side front</li>
</ul>

<p>Right hand drive cars which you'll find in the UK should most likely follow this sequence:</p>

<ul>
<li>Passenger (left) side rear</li>
<li>Driver (right) side rear</li>
<li>Passenger (left) side front</li>
<li>Driver (right) side front</li>
</ul>

<p>This should get your car back in pretty good shape. Don't worry too much about your mistake as it happens to the bets of us. Just chalk it up to inexperience and learn from it.</p>

"Crackling/popping when wheels move at slow speed (e.g., rolling forward in drive)","10842","","<p>My suspicion is that there is something loose (pebble, rock, or some other small, foreign object) behind the hub cap, but I hear a crackling or popping sound (almost like Pop Rocks or Rice Krispies) when my 2011 Kia Rio gently rolls forward or backward at a slow speed. It almost sounds ""sandy,"" if that makes sense, like the noise a heavy car might make when rolling forward over a sandy or salted pavement. (I'm trying to be as descriptive as possible to help cue people in.) However, it seems to occur even on smooth pavement, and the Kia Rio is comparatively not a heavy car.</p>

<p>The sound either goes away or becomes inaudible (indistinguishable from background noise) when actually driving. It does not occur when immobile/idling. The sound is irregular, in the sense that it seems more like random crackling or popping. From the driver's seat, it seems like it's coming from beneath the car or near the wheels.</p>

<p>This is my first car in many years--I have lived in a city and been using public transit for a long time--so I am willing to admit that I am just not accustomed to the sounds that a car normally makes. Preliminary Internet research seems to have ruled out things like bad brakes or suspension, but I'm not sure. It would be great to learn that this is just one of those noises cars can make, and that it's innocuous.</p>
","<p>If there are no noticeable rocks/debris as Steve states another possibility is it may be normal noise.  Tires will deform slightly when rolling to form a flat contact patch with the road surface.  When this happens the rubber treads stretch and compress and make ""groaning"" sounds.  The quality and type of rubber, the tread pattern, and the age of the tire can greatly effect the noise the rubber makes in addition to the road surface.   </p>

<p>As a tire comes up to normal driving speeds this deflection becomes normal background noise.  Sometimes this effect can form a resonance with the air cavity of the tire and form a droning sound.  </p>

<p>There also may be some mechanical issues with bearings or other rolling parts.  Normally bearing issues will become louder the faster it turns, but in the early stages of failure this may not be the case.  </p>

<p>If the noise changes while rolling over different road surfaces, asphalt vs concrete vs coated/painted, it's like just normal tire noises.  If it remains the same trapped debris is more likely.   </p>

"What Could Cause a Sudden Loud Noise When Driving on Highway?","10841","","<p>1990 Toyota 4Runner, V6, automatic transmission, 2 or 4 wheel drive (which I always keep in 2WD).  I've owned the car for about two months, the previous owner, whom I know and trust, drove this car for a year without any major troubles.</p>

<p>Update 2012-10-22 - It happened again this morning, on a 55 MPH highway.  I think it's a pump or the alternator, because it sounds an awful lot like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twuCtZAg3a0"" rel=""nofollow"">this YouTube video</a>, but a lot louder.  It seems to go away once the car has slowed down enough for the motor to go below ~1000 RPM (unless it's something that spins in direct proportion to the wheels, as opposed to the motor).  Needless to say, this makes positively identifying the source of the noise difficult.  I guess the question now is, ""what other than the alternator can make this kind of sound""?</p>

<p>I was driving on the interstate, and after less than two minutes, a loud noise started in the engine compartment or dashboard.  It sounded like a giant fan straining to suck air, or a motor spinning at a million RPM.  The noise didn't fade immediately when I took my foot off the gas, but it seemed like it got quieter as the wheels slowed down - it was gone (or almost completely gone) by the time the wheels stopped.  I got into the breakdown lane, shut off the engine, checked under the hood, and there was no smoke, unusual smell or anything falling off.  I restarted the engine, looked under the hood again, and everything was running and sounding fine.  I got off the interstate, and finished driving to work on the back roads, and the noise did not return.  Steering, acceleration and braking were fine during the incident.  I drove it back and forth to work the next few days, including on the interstate, but it doesn't reliably recur, and it always goes away by the time the car comes to a full stop.</p>

<p>It may or may not be related, but I just replaced the steering gear box and switched from 33x12.50-15 to 31-10.50-15 tires (previous owner took it offroading, but I'm not into that) two days before the first incident.  After replacing the steering gear box and tires, the steering seemed tight for a day, but that got better rapidly on its own.  As I said above, during the loud noise, the steering seemed fine and responsive while I was coasting into the breakdown lane, which is why I question whether it is related.</p>

<p>So, any ideas?  It sounds like bearings dying in something that spins (belts can't make that noise, can they?), but since the noise is gone by the time the car comes to a stop, positively identifying the source may prove tricky.</p>
","<p>It was the speedometer cable.  Lubing it with WD-40 has helped significantly.</p>

<p>Cold weather makes it worse.  It's coming from the dashboard, and is correlated with wheel speed, and it sounds like the noise at <a href=""http://youtu.be/ICiJuEBbf6A"">http://youtu.be/ICiJuEBbf6A</a>, except it's more consistent once it starts.</p>

<li>From the point of view of mass, a smaller car appears to be a
disadvantage if in an accident with a bigger car, because the change

<p>For anyone interested in more details of how it breaks down per vehicle, I've found a <a href=""http://www.iihs.org/externaldata/srdata/docs/sr4605.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">report</a> the IIHS did in 2011 showing stats for dozens of the most popular vehicles.  This can be read online, but is an electronic copy of something that was apparently originally a bound paper booklet.  The middle column of the per vehicle model table is split between two pages and is much easier to read if you have a large display and can download the pdf and view two pages side by side.  </p>

<p>This is a noisy dataset (for many of the less common vehicles only a handful of fatal accidents are involved); but the spread within a single vehicle type is often larger than the spread between the averages for overall vehicle types.  It's also several years old (2005-8 model years vs 2011-14 for the graph/table above).  </p>

<p>Even in such a short period of time you can see the overall improvements in vehicle safety, the 55 deaths/million vehicle years rate for mini cars from 2011-14 is about a third less than the equivalent from 2005-08 models, and comparable to mid/large size cars from the era.</p>

<p>Over longer periods the overall improvement is even more dramatic.  I made this graph from a table of data in the IIHS report linked to at the top of my answer.  Modern vehicles of all types are roughly 5x less likely to kill occupants in accidents than they were 40 years ago.  For SUV's its more like a 10x improvement; although that's mostly driven by massive improvements in the late 70s and early 80s that brought them inline with other vehicle types.  Since then they've behaved more or less like any other vehicle type.  You can also see the effect of electronic stability control becoming standard in pickup trucks at the end of the last decade as their survivability numbers improve significantly due to the reduction in rollover rates.

"Low oil pressure, car doesn't start. Have I damaged my engine?","10780","","<p>I have a 97 Cherokee. It was stolen for a few weeks, then I got it back and left it idle for another two weeks. I knew it had an oil leak, but I didn't realize the extent of the leak until my car failed to start this morning (it cranks, sometimes whimpers and dies). I checked my oil and it was very low, just at the tip of the dipstick. For some reason, I had no indication of this from my warning lights. </p>

<p>I had driven the previous day and noticed some performance problems upon acceleration. I actually sniffed around the hood after parking but didn't smell any burning or anything.</p>

<p>My question is, is my car not starting because of the low oil pressure, or because I have done irrevocable damage to the engine by driving on low oil? Or in other words, if I replaced the oil, should my car work again? </p>
","<blockquote>

<p>That's really not so bad. You would never want to drive it that way intentionally, but the sump certainly isn't sucking air at that level.</p>

<p>Like I said above, you're not sucking air which is why you didn't get a low oil pressure light.... so you don't have a low oil pressure problem. You almost certainly have not damaged your engine. </p>

"Is it dangerous/damaging to start an engine with a spark plug removed?","10708","","<p>Rookie question here: If I want to test for spark, the most obvious thing seems to be to disconnect the gas line, remove the spark plug, plug it back in, ground the outside turn the ignition, and check for spark.  And <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUOmsGiirTU"" rel=""nofollow"">there's a video</a> where the guy does just that, but it's on a 1 cylinder lawnmower engine.  </p>

<p>It seems that doing the same thing on a 4 cylinder car engine might be a bad idea, since (1) You now have gas-air mix spraying out of the open cylinder (obviously you'd want to distance that from the plug you're testing) (2) One cylinder is open, with no pressure, the others are closed, which might create some kind of mechanical stress on the engine.</p>

<p>So, yes, I'm aware that I could just get another spark plug and swap it in there, but I'm just curious how bad an idea it is to start an engine with an open cylinder.</p>
","<p>It doesn't hurt things to test the spark or spark plug by doing so. You obviously don't want to run it that way for long. Most fuel injected vehicles have a fuse in the under hood fuse box which is for the fuel injectors. If you pull that fuse, the injectors won't fire, though everything else still works just fine, like the firing of the spark plugs (as long as that's not the issue ;-). This allows you to do the diagnostic without the worry of the engine running or fuel coming out of the single hole.</p>

<p>There's another thing you can do besides pulling the plug. There is a piece of equipment called a <em>noid</em>. It is a piece which goes inline with the spark plug wire. If the electricity is going to ground, it will strobe for you. This won't show you if the electricity is passing through a bad spark plug which is grounding, but it will give you an idea. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1uY3C.jpg"" alt=""Spark Plug Noid Set""></p>

<p>If you believe you have a bad spark plug, you can also move the spark plug to another cylinder to see if the problem follows the spark plug or stays in the same cylinder. This diagnostic can help track down the issue.</p>

<p>One of the things you <em>don't</em> want to do is to not have a way for the spark to travel to ground such as just pulling the spark plug wire and leaving it be while trying to run the engine. With some vehicles it can burn the coil out or cause other issues ... just a word of caution.</p>

"Transmission damage due to uneven tread wear on AWD vehicle","10680","","<p>I have a 2013 Subaru Impreza with a continuously variable transmission with ~40k miles on it.  About two months ago I blew out the front right tire and took it to a tire shop.  The folks at the tire shop said the tire wasn't repairable and that I had to replace two tires.  The put the new tires on the back and moved the undamaged, but worn tires on the front.  I can't remember if the worn tires were 60% worn or 40% worn, but they were the stock tires that I bought the car with.</p>

<p>About a month ago (and maybe 2k miles after replacing the tires) I started hearing a humming/clicking noise from the car (though no indicator lights went off).  I took it to a shop and they told me that the noise was coming from the transmission and that I had to take it to the dealership.  The dealer told me that the transmission was shot due to the diameter difference between the worn front tires and the new rear tires.  Apparently the front tires are 4/32 thread and the rear are 10/32.  The dealer claims that the warranty (which covers the powertrain to 60k miles) is void because the tread difference was responsible for the error.  According to the dealer any tire shop should have seen the difference in tread and either changed all 4 tires or shaved the new tires down.  The dealership wants ~$10k to replace the transmission.</p>

<p>I know nothing about this stuff and have spent several hours reading through conflicting information trying to figure out whether the tread difference could shoot the transmission.  Based on some similar questions on this forum it sounds like the differential might be damaged as a result of something like this, but I have yet to see anything definitive about the transmission.  Assuming that the tread difference was indeed responsible for the transmission damage (and assuming that the transmission is really totally damaged) is it reasonable to ask the tire shop to help pay the 10k? </p>
","<p>They likely do hold some liability, since they should have known that an AWD should have matching tire diameters across all tires.</p>

<p>They may argue that you hold some responsibility since the Impreza owners manual makes this pretty clear: . </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You must install
  four tires that are of the same size, circumference, construction,
  manufacturer, brand (tread pattern), degree of wear, speed symbol and
  load index. Mixing tires of different types, sizes or degrees of wear
  can result in damage to the vehicle’s power train. Use of different
  types or sizes of tires can also dangerously reduce controllability
  and braking performance and can lead to an accident.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, it seems to be well known in the tire industry that AWD's  need matching tires, and that Subaru's tolerances are particularly tight:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.souzastireservice.com/tires-101/tire-matching-awd-4wd.aspx"">http://www.souzastireservice.com/tires-101/tire-matching-awd-4wd.aspx</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Subarus have, to our knowledge, the tightest tolerance of any AWD
  system. Since we see so many, we can tell you what the tolerance is.
  It can be stated in two ways: The first is 2/32nds tread depth across
  all four tires. The problem with this is that actual tire dimensions
  can vary from brand to brand and even from model to model.  </p>
  
  <p>... </p>
  
  <p>You
  may ask what the big deal is? Well, on the Subarus, if all four tires
  aren't matched within 1/4"" around the circumference, you will break
  the transmission, not maybe or sometimes - it definitely happens.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here's a tire shop that took responsibility for installing mismatched tires and replaced a customer's differential:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So to be clear, by replacing the two tires we reduced the circumference differential by .75"" and the tread depth by 2/32nds.
  This is supposed to be good. The speed rating was identical, but the
  tread design was different.</p>
  
  <p>We concluded that the tread design was the culprit. We replaced the
  transfer case and installed two more tires to match. Car fixed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And here's another shop that ended up replacing a transfer case:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.tirebusiness.com/article/19990705/ISSUE/307059999/matching-tires-on-4wds-differences-of-1-4-inche-in-diameter-can"">http://www.tirebusiness.com/article/19990705/ISSUE/307059999/matching-tires-on-4wds-differences-of-1-4-inche-in-diameter-can</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mr. Albert said he asked the customer: ``Why are you coming back to
  me? I put on the same sized tire that was on the vehicle.'' The
  customer replied that the auto dealership told him all four tires have
  to be the same height and should be the same brand.</p>
  
  <p>Mr. Albert said he turned the invoice over to his insurance company
  which promptly reimbursed the customer and assured him his tire
  department had done nothing wrong. But from now on, Mr. Albert said,
  he's going to insist on installing only four identical tires on
  four-wheel- and all-wheel-drive vehicles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So,  I'd definitely approach the shop and ask them to pay. If it's a national shop and the local manager won't accept responsibility, look up their corporate contact information and see if the corporate office will help out. Be civil and professional in your communications. If you have a local news media consumer advocate, get in touch with them since public exposure may prompt the company to do the right thing, likewise, you can try contacting them via social media. If all else fails, contact a lawyer about legal remedies.</p>

<p>That said, $10K sounds expensive for a transmission replacement... I would definitely shop around on this (and maybe go with a rebuilt transmission), especially if you end up paying for it yourself. I would have expected only the transfer case to need replacement, though maybe that's built into the transmission.</p>

"Daytime running light failure -- one side only","10666","","<p>I have a 1991 Miata. It's a Canadian vehicle, and so is equipped with daytime running lights. Recently, I've noticed that the passenger side light is not working as a DRL. The driver's side light works fine. A multi-meter shows that no current is being delivered to the passenger-side bulb, while the driver's side get 14 V.</p>

<p>The turn signal bulb is used as the daylight running light. The passenger side light works in all other respects. When indicating a right-hand turn, it blinks. When the main lights are on, it's on. When the driving lights are on, it's on. </p>

<p>I suspect that the relay responsible for turning on the daytime running lights is failing, but before I order the part, I thought I'd check here if there are other possible explanations for this behaviour.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Some more information in response to questions in the comments:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The bulb for the DRL is dual filament. The brighter filament is for the DRL and the turn signal. The less bright filament lights when the headlights are on.</p></li>
<li><p>When DRL are on, the turn signal sequence is off-on-off-on because the DRL and turn signal use the same filament.</p></li>
<li><p>The wires to the connector are red, green and black. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>And one piece of interesting new information. The passenger side turn signal (right-hand turn) is starting to act strange intermittently. The relay cycles faster, maybe double the normal speed. The front turn signal does not light at all, while the rear on acts normally. This is the behaviour I've seen before when the front indicator bulb has burned out. </p>

<p>I'm starting to think the problem is not the DRL relay, but rather an electrical fault somewhere between the relay and the bulb. Since the turn signal and the DRL use the same filament but different relays, the fact that both are failing makes me think there's a problem in the wiring downstream of the relays.</p>
","<p>With the additional information you have posted, I am in agreement with your initial assessment that a relay or relays are to blame. It sounds like you can get both high and low intensity out of the affected bulb under certain circumstances (high works OK when using the turn signal, and if I understand you correctly, low works OK as a running light when the headlights are on), therefore the wiring to the bulb must be OK.</p>

"Can I use a different size donut spare tire for my 97 Accord?","10637","","<p>My 1997 Honda Accord came with a 115/70/14 donut spare tire.  I had to use it for the first time recently, and it is now totally dead and needs to be replaced.</p>

<p>I looked on Ebay and there are a few people selling 115/70/14 Accord donut tires.  But there are also a few people selling different sized Accord donut spares that they say will work on a 97 Accord.  Those are sized 135/80/15, 125/70/15, and 125/70/14.</p>

<p><strong><em>Do I have to get a 115/70/14 tire, or will one of those other sized spares work as well?</em></strong></p>
","<p>There is a huge pile of information about tire sizing around the internet. I'll attempt to summarize its application here.</p>

<p>Tires have 3 numbers, which work together to describe the tire's size. The first number is the section width, the second number is the sidewall ratio and the third number is the rim diameter.</p>

<p><strong>Section Width</strong></p>

<p>The section width is the width of the tire in millimeters at the largest point. This is important when trying to fit a tire to a rim, but in your case the rim is already matched to the tire so we're good. The number does still matter for us because of what we're calculating.</p>

<p><strong>Sidewall Aspect Ratio</strong></p>

<p>This is the distance from the rim to the tread. It is described as a percentage of the section width, so a 70% sidewall with a 130 section width will be taller than a 70% sidewall with a 110 section width.</p>

<p><strong>Rim Diameter</strong></p>

<p>This is the most obvious of the numbers. It is the rim diameter in inches. Why is the section width in millimeters and the rim diameter in inches? My guess is the same reason many manufactured parts in America are dimensioned in inches, but sometimes they hang out alongside parts manufactured to metric dimensions.</p>

<p>We can use these numbers to (roughly) calculate tire diameter...</p>

<p>Let's start with a standard factory sized '97 Accord tire (yours may vary depending on trim, but it will probably have a similar outer diameter):</p>

<p>185/65R15</p>

"Semi-automatic car inadvertently driven in manual mode","10604","","<p>I have a 2008 Mazda 3 car with a semi-automatic transmission (i.e. it is automatic with the ability to switch to a manual mode).</p>

<p>What is the likelihood that this would have caused any damage?  I have driven the car since, and also looked under the bonnet and everything sounds okay and the car is driving just as it did before.</p>

"What happens if you keep starting the car for too long?","10596","","<p>If you're starting the engine and it has already started but you keep pressing the key and the starter keeps working while the engine is running.  What can this cause?? Could it harm anything?</p>
","<p>This is called ""run on"" of the starter. It doesn't cause a huge issue if it doesn't happen too much or for too long, but basically the Bendix stays engaged in the flywheel ring gear an is being then driven by the engine. </p>

<p>To further explain, the Bendix (or pinion drive mechanism) is the part on the end of the starter armature which engages the flywheel (or flexplate) ring gear when you engage the starter. The Bendix has a built in one way clutch as part of it. When it is engaging the ring gear prior to the engine starting, the clutch is solid and allows the gear to rotate the engine. When the engine starts up, it will now be spinning faster than the starter is, so the clutch in the Bendix allows the gear to turn freely so as to not increase the speed of the starter armature. It is designed this way to prevent damage to the starter motor itself in just the situation you are talking about. If the starter were to get over driven, it would cause excess wear very quickly.</p>

<p>If the Bendix gets over driven for a long period of time, you will cause the one-way clutch to spin freely, but it also causes heat from friction as the one-way clutch always has a clamping force on the internals of the Bendix. As stated, it is designed to take this for short periods of time, so no worry there. For your convenience, here is a blown apart picture of a generic starter. The starter in your vehicle probably doesn't look exactly like this, but all the parts will pretty much be there in one shape or another.</p>

"My automatic transmission slid to neutral while driving down the freeway. Can I just put it back in drive?","10596","","<p>Just curious if this has ever happened to anyone. I know people who like to put objects behind the shifter, heavy enough to slide the shifter to neutral. So it got me thinking, if this happens, can they just shift back into drive going, say, >10mph without damage? or must they slow down to a crawl. My gut tells me they have to slow down, so the gear can catch.</p>
","<p>It is fine to just put it back into drive. You probably don't want to do it repeatedly because you could maybe wear out some clutch packs in your auto trans but for the most part it is much safer to just throw it into drive and get back into the flow of traffic than coasting and pulling over to stop then back to drive.</p>

<p>When you put the car into neutral at speed the output shaft is decoupled from the input shaft. This means that they can start rotating at an unmatched speed. To go back to drive this speed needs to be resynchronized.</p>

<p>There are three components of the auto trans that should protect it from damage.</p>

<p>1) The torque converter - The torque converter spins at engine speed and the input shaft can rotate independent of that speed (equal or even much slower). Since the input shaft can rotate fairly independent of the engine it should not provide a huge amount of force if you try to change the speed of the input shaft to match the output shaft (which happens when you go back to drive).</p>

<p>2) Clutch packs - Most auto transmissions contain clutch packs which engage /disengage to enable or disable certain rotations and therefore certain gears. These work similar to any other clutch in that they will allow some slip as they engage cushioning or smoothening the engagement of the gear. This is what will clamp down to try to synchronize the input and output shaft. The two halves of the clutch pack will be rotating at different speeds when in neutral then when you go to drive the clutch will be engaged and they will synchronize. These will absorb most of the force and the torque converter will also absorb some and prevent the load of the engine from adding too much more force.</p>

<p>3) Accumulators - Auto transmissions contain large hydraulic cylinders which are designed to cause the hydraulic fluid to build up pressure gradually or smoothly instead of slamming immediate pressure to the components. These should allow the clutch pack to engage smoothly instead of rapidly causing undue stress on other components.</p>

"Aligning a castle nut with a torque spec to a cotter pin hole","10569","","<p>The nuts at the knuckle on my outer tie rod ends are castle nuts, which are locked by cotter pins fed through holes in the studs. The nuts also have a torque spec (27.0±2.5 N∙m, in this case).</p>

<p>If I tighten them down to the midpoint of that spec, the holes and the crenellations may or may not align such that I can get the pin through. It's possible to rotate the stud, since its base is a ball joint, but that requires removing the nut completely so that the stud can be popped out of the knuckle again. That's likely to require repeated attempts and be an utter pain.</p>

<p>Is the correct procedure here to deliberately use the range in the torque spec to allow the hole to line up? That is, should I torque the nut down, then -- staying within ±<em>n</em> -- turn the nut in or out to access the nearest slot to the hole?</p>
","<p>I would not back the nut off to align the nut with the cotter pinhole. Doing so can result in the taper between the knuckle and the tierod becoming loose.

As @MikeSaull has suggested lube the threads. I would torque it to spec, then if necessary tighten enough to align the castle nut and cotterpin hole.  </p>

"How does intake manifold runner length effect the power curve of a car?","10560","","<p>Recently I learned that a number of things such as the <a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/24445/what-are-performance-camshafts"">cam profile</a>, <a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/17419/importance-of-engine-compression-ratio"">compression ratio</a> and the <strong><em>intake manifold runner length and volume</em></strong> can all effect the power curve of the engine. </p>

<p>Here is an example of one.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4XWip.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4XWip.png"" alt=""Power Curve""></a></p>

<ul>
<li>What exactly is the intake manifold runner length?</li>
<li>What exactly is the intake manifold runner volume?</li>
<li><strong><em>How can the intake manifold runner length and volume effect the power curve of the engine?</em></strong></li>
</ul>
","<p>Intake manifold runner length is the linear distance from the inlet port (the face of the head) to a common point shared by all cylinders. Depending on the throttle position this could be the open atmosphere (if each cylinder has its own throttle butterfly) or a plenum (if they share a throttle body).</p>

<p>The intake runner volume is the volume of that section of the inlet system, ie the cross sectional area multiplied by the length.</p>

<p>The very short answer to the final question is that short, wide inlet runners move the torque curve up the rev range whereas long, narrow runners move the curve down the rev range. BUT - there is a whole lot more to it than that. The effect is caused by 'pulse waves', waves of relatively high and low pressure in the runner.</p>

<p>The opening of an inlet valve causes low pressure at the engine end of the runner, as the engine sucks air out of the runner. Air starts to flow down the runner into the cylinder until the valve shuts, at which point all that air (travelling at high speed) crashes into the shut valve and creates a relatively high pressure 'slug' of air. This is reflected and starts to move back up the runner until the valve opens again, at which point it heads back towards the port. </p>

<p>If the dimensions of the runner are calculated well, the high pressure 'slug' or 'pressure wave' will make its way through the port before the valve shuts again, when the next 'slug' is created. The dimensions are critical to the operating speed of the engine. If the runner is short, the reflected pulse might fall out of the end before the valve opens to suck it back in. If the runner is too long, the larger mass of air may react too slowly to perform well at high engine speeds. </p>

<p>This is the reason car manufacturers have invented variable or twin length inlet manifolds, which change the dimensions of the inlet runners at a certain RPM to give improved torque across the engine's rev range.</p>

<p>There is an excellent feature written by Dave Walker, an engine tuning guru from the UK. He performs A-B-A tests comparing inlet runner lengths on a 1600cc engine in an amateur racing car. </p>

"How does the tracking on the car get hit 'out'","10522","","<p>As per the title. If the tracking on a car is adjusted by adjusting the threaded part on the track rod end, how exactly does the tracking go 'out' of alignment over time, and/or how does hitting a kerb or a pothole cause the alignment to shift ???</p>

<p>Everything seems to be rigid, so is it a case of something bending slightly. If the tracking is adjusted using a threaded rod on the track rod end, how does hitting a kerb or a pothole seem to move this adjustment around ??</p>
","<p>The alignment goes out after a hit due to bending of components. There are three main things that are looked at during an alignment, and a couple of secondary measurements. I will only discuss the main three, which are <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camber_angle"" rel=""nofollow"">camber</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caster_angle"" rel=""nofollow"">caster</a>, and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toe_%28automotive%29"" rel=""nofollow"">toe</a>. The toe and camber are usually the ones that are adjusted when you get your alignment, as the caster is normally set by the vehicle manufacturer. Caster allows for assistance in turning, as it returns the wheel to a centered position. Camber allows for the tires to be placed flat on the ground during a turn, assisting the vehicle while turning. Toe assist in your steering, as it determines which direction the vehicle travels in relation to a straight center line. <br>
When your alignment is off, it is usually caused by your camber, and toe. These two measurements are normally controlled by your suspension (struts, or mounts) and the tie rods (thin metal screw rods). As we all know roads are not the greatest in most areas of the world, so as the vehicle is traveling, under constant vibrations, it will make some of this parts come loose. This allows them to move around, and slowly come out of alignment. Also, air in your tires is a big factor in your alignment, so if your vehicle is aligned with flat tires, it will be a horrible drive when you air them up. <br>
Lastly, as Brian mentioned, wear on the joints will give the suspension movement that contributes to the misalignment of your vehicle. This can either be caused by slow bending of components, or the extra play accelerates the loosening process of the nuts holding all those components in place.</p>

"Do different brands of the same oil really make a difference?","10505","","<p>I've found <a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/2545/are-there-different-kinds-of-10w-40-oil"">several</a> <a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/258/what-differences-between-synthetic-and-dino-oil"">other</a> <a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/84/is-it-worth-switching-to-full-synthetic-or-blend-oil-in-my-older-car-truck/136#136"">questions</a> on here that answer, ""what's different between synthetic oil and regular oil?"" or ""Can I use X oil in Y car?"", or similar, but nothing that quite answers my question.</p>

<p>I have a car with a high revving engine that requires 10w-30 full synthetic oil. My mechanic (who primarily works on racecars) uses Valvoline, but several other people I've talked to swear up and down that if I'm not using Mobile 1 or Royal Purple or insert-your-favorite-brand-here, that my engine isn't going to last as long or perform as well. When I'd ask about the difference though (they're all 10w-30 full synthetic, right?) none of them could give me an answer. I'm aware that certain synthetics might be parafin based which would gunk up the works, but I don't think any of the above examples are actually parafin based.</p>

<p><em>TL;DR: Is there really a difference between different brands of full-synthetic 10w-30 oil?</em></p>
","<p>Sam, Chemistry isn't my strong suit, but when it comes to synthetic then no, they <em>are not</em> created equal. I know you're not looking for a shopping recommendation, and I can't give you one anyway. What I can say is that the additives the manufacturers use are selected for different reasons (high temperature additives for races cars, different additives for older high mileage engines, etc), so knowing that will help you make the right choice.</p>

<p>From putting 150k of the 200k miles on my current daily driver I'll tell you that initially I used Valvoline high mileage religiously, but when I need oil (slow leak) in a pinch, I'll pull up to the nearest gas station and grab the cheapest 10w-30 they got, and like I said -- I'm somewhere in the vicinity of 200k miles (digital odometer died) and the engine runs smooth if I do say so myself.</p>

<p>I've always (usually) followed the advice: <em>keep the oil changed</em>. You probably know after so long the oil will change it's viscous properties, which can be bad for the engine. The different additives can delay or (as a result of achieving another feature) speed up this breakdown.</p>

"How does low oil level cause misfires or VTEC malfunctions?","10459","","<p>So a few days ago my 2003 Honda Civic EX started misfiring while accelerating, especially with the A/C turned on, making popping noises, and then yesterday got a P1259 ""VTEC system malfunction code"".

<p>Anyway, after refilling the oil and clearing the code, it's working fine.  No misfires even if I floor it with the A/C on.</p>

<p>I'd like to understand this better, though.   How does low oil level cause these problems?  Was it bad enough to damage the engine?  Should I be on the lookout for related problems now?</p>
","<p>I observed this same situation in my 1997 Integra back in the day.  If you look at the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTEC#Context.2C_and_description"">summary on Wikipedia</a>, you can see why the oil pressure is critical to VTEC:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the switch point a solenoid is actuated which allows oil pressure
  from a spool valve to operate a locking pin which binds the high RPM
  cam follower to the low RPM ones.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, without sufficient oil pressure, the VTEC system can't execute the shift from low rev to high rev cam lobes.  Now, as you observe, the VTEC issue is a later symptom indicating low oil so my advice is not to wait until you see that code before you check the oil....</p>

<p>Having to take it off for the thermostat does sound correct though, even if they could have gotten to it physically without, they probably would have gotten coolant on the belt and that is supposed to be bad for it.</p>

<p>Try to see if you can get the factory spec on how many teeth there should be between each position and count to see if it is correct.  My engine had previously been off by two teeth on one cam gear and after fixing it my fuel mileage went up, engine accelerated smoother and had a smoother idle.</p>

<p>As far as cold vs warm start, just a guess but whatever component is having an issue must be being affected by the raised temperature from the engine saturating it, making it not perform as well.</p>

<p>That could be anything under the hood though.</p>

<p>Since adding throttle helps, perhaps something with air or fuel delivery.  Fuel filter, fuel pressure regulator, injectors, air filter, mass airflow sensor, etc.</p>

Since my car has 200,000 miles on it, and i have had some experience with soldering and circuitry i want to wire it up myself.</p>

<p>has anyone done anything like this before?</p>

<p>It is a '93 Mazda Protege</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>First off I can say that I have done something like this, but with the ignition and not the horn - my friends ignition switch broke so we wired a bright red push button directly from the battery (well - actually a fused 12v line inside the car) to the starter motor coil - it has since worked like a champ for nearly two years.</p>

<p>First off - DO NOT wire directly from the battery, there is always a potential for a short (say in an accident or due to your own mistake) and those lead-acid batteries can be unpleasant when they explode. Nothing will ruin your day than having a car fire after your accident, use an inline fuse at least, using the cars existing fuse/breaker system would be better (i.e. use an existing 12v line)</p>

<p>Your best bet would be to splice the 12v from the accessory 12v line in the harness (it should be exposed near your radio) Since this is fused and isolated from any more important components. <em>TYPICALLY</em> the horn is on its own branch, just because it needs to be activated by the alarm system and should be able to honk when the key is out (the accessory 12v is usually shut off when the key is taken out), however this may not be important to you.</p>

<p>The <em>proper</em> way would be to look up the wiring diagram in your car and find which wire in the harness corresponds to the horn 12v supply (it may be tied to some other 12v line - like internal illumination) and which wire corresponds to the horn, -tie the two together with a switch and you are good to go.</p>

<p>The ""stupid college student way"" (I only say this because this is what we did with my friends ignition) to approach the problem would be to pull a wire through the firewall and directly to the horn, tied to some random 12v line near the dash. </p>

<p>As for placing the switch... I would avoid opening up the steering wheel, but thats just my squeemishness around airbag systems, although I don't know if your car has a driver airbag so it may be clear. And depending on the rules in texas, you may be required to attach it to the steering wheel somehow.</p>

","<p>There are two usual problems associated with latches failing to latch.</p>

<p>The first (and simplest) is an alignment problem - if the striker is too far from the latch, it will never trigger it and thus it won't latch. You can test this by getting hold of something a similar diameter to the striker (such as a screwdriver) and trying to use that to trigger the latch. If that works, it is simply a case of re-adjusting both parts until it latches cleanly. This is hinted at by your second paragraph as chewing up the striker is a common symptom of misalignment.</p>

<p>If that doesn't work, then the second likely thing is that the latch has failed or something is preventing it from closing. If it is rarely used this might simply be down to it gumming up, in which case cleaning out the mechanism and re-greasing the appropriate bits may fix it. Is it an electrically operated one or mechanical? If it is mechanical the cable might be stiff and so not letting the latch close properly, but I would assume it is electrical and thus that wouldn't be the problem.</p>

<p>For example: Valvoline makes a conventional, Max Life blend, and Full Synthetic oil products.</p>
","<p>Check with your dealer or manufacturer to see if synthetic is usable in your car first of all.  For example, RX-7s have traditionally recommended against synthetic because they inject some oil into the combustion chamber and synthetic oils don't work as well for sealing the ""apex seals"" in this application.</p>

<p>Beyond that, there is also a theory that synthetic oils may break down sludge and varnish which is sealing what would otherwise be leaks.  So switching to a synthetic may cause a car that has no leaks to start leaking.  I've never had that happen or known that to happen, but they do promote reducing sludge and varnish as a feature of synthetics.</p>

<p>However, if you have a turbocharged car, I'd use synthetic in it in any case.  Turbochargers run at extremely high temperatures and are lubricated and cooled by oil.  Synthetics react better to extremely high temperatures, so they are particularly useful in turbo applications.</p>

<p>That said, I've had some mixed results with Synthetics that make me question their worth.</p>

<p>One situation was an old '86 Subaru GL-10 wagon I had.  It had a turbo and I put Mobile-1 in the engine and Red Line in the trans-axle.  My wife and I took the car up to Canada on one trip where it was -25 to -45 degrees.  The car ran surprisingly well, including shifting, compared to my experience in Colorado which rarely gets below -10.  That was a clear win for the synthetics.</p>

<p>A decade ago I had a '89 VW Vanagon that I put a new engine in.  After the initial break-in, I ran nothing by Mobile-1 in it.  I had all sorts of problems with it keeping oil pressure up, which went away when I switched to a high quality regular oil (Delo 400) at a mechanics' recommendation.</p>

<p>Around 5 years ago my '97 Audi, which I had run from the first oil change with Mobile-1, had 2 of the lifters go quite badly, in what I'd consider a lubrication-related failure.  Here is a picture:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/EKQgO.jpg"" alt=""Failed lifters from my Audi""></p>

<p>Now, maybe this was a design problem, but I haven't heard of it being common on these engines.  SO my take on it is that, in my admittedly small sample size, the only lubrication-related failure I've ever had has been on the car I ran Mobil-1 in from the first oil change.</p>

<p>So, I won't run Mobil-1 in my cars, and I'm mostly skeptical of it's competitors.</p>

<p>I'm now running the Delo 400 traditional oil in my Audi that had the lifter problems -- around 100K miles since the lifter replacement and no problems.  In my other car, it takes some fairly unusual weight, and recommends synthetic, so I'm running Red Line in there, at around $10/qt.  Lucky for me it ""only"" takes 8 quarts for an oil change :-).  But, it's an expensive engine, with 40 valves, so I think it's worth the ""good stuff"".</p>

<p>In my transaxles, I've been extremely happy with Red Line, so I'm trying it in this engine.</p>

"Static vs. Effective compression: Why does higher effective compression not require higher octane gas?","10236","","<h3>Background</h3>

<p><br />
I've been trying to do a lot of research on boost lately because I'm planning on running a moderate turbo setup on my daily/light-duty-autox car in the future. I'm trying to get into the physics of things so that when I do my build, I'm not just slapping parts on and hoping for the best, but instead engineering a motor to work.</p>

<h3>The question</h3>

<p><br />
My main question is this. I've been reading <a href=""http://hondaswap.com/turbo-information/static-vs-effective-compression-29102/"" rel=""nofollow"">this article</a> and while it's deepened my understanding of compression, it leaves me with this question: I know that engines running a higher static compression ratio require higher octane fuels to prevent detonation, so why do motors with higher <em>effective</em> compression ratios not seem to require higher octane fuels?</p>

<p>I usually hear about people running turbo setups and simply using regular pump gas and having no trouble, even though the effective compression ratio would be much higher than most naturally aspirated engines. For instance, the setup that I was considering would be a turbocharged Honda d16a6, which has a static compression ratio of 9.1:1, with 10 psi of boost, giving it roughly 15:1 effective compression.</p>
","<p>tl;dr: <strong>They do.  It's just harder to tell how much.</strong></p>

<p>The longer answer is that they do and that effective compression is failing you as an approximation for actual effects.</p>

<p>Think about detonation (AKA premature ignition of the fuel-air mixture).  Normally we consider two causes: compression (the change in the space enclosed by the cylinder as the piston moves up and down) and temperature (e.g., measured temperature of the intake air).  </p>

<p>In reality, there is only temperature.</p>

<p>Let's back all the way to the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_gas_law"" rel=""nofollow"">ideal gas law</a>: </p>

<pre><code>PV = nRT
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>P</code> is pressure, <code>V</code> is volume and <code>T</code> is temperature (in degrees Kelvin, remember!) and the rest are interesting constants that aren't germane to this discussion.  Compression causes that <code>V</code> value to decrease and <code>P</code> to increase.  In an <em>ideal</em> world, that would be the end of it: the compression of the cylinder would be a 100% efficient process without temperature increase. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, we live in an <em>actual</em> rather than an ideal world. The best simple model for what's happening in the engine is that it is a system of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_gas_law#Applications_to_thermodynamic_processes"" rel=""nofollow"">constant entropy</a>.  This means that we are restricted by the heat capacity ratio of the gases in the system.  If we use a heat capacity ratio of 1.3 and an example compression ratio of 10:1, we are looking at an approximate doubling in temperature (degrees Kelvin!). </p>

<p>In short, compression makes gases hotter.  Why is this bad, though?</p>

<p>Think of it this way: you have a fixed temperature budget for a certain octane gas.  If <code>T</code> gets higher than <code>T_ignition</code>, bang.  So, as you point out, you can add an intercooler to the system, reducing the input air temperature.</p>

<p>Likewise, you can change the amount that <code>V</code> changes.  This increases the amount of temperature increase that your engine can tolerate before detonating.</p>

<p>Now, adding a turbo on the intake air compresses the normal atmospheric pressure to something significantly higher, resulting in a change in those other constants that I previously brushed off (check turbo volumetric efficiency for more information) and increases the temperature.  </p>

<p>That eats into my temperature budget.  If I used lower octane gas, that would lower the threshold for detonation and, at boost, I could be looking at engine damage.</p>

<p>So, after all that, what do you do?</p>

<ol>
<li>Research research research: don't build in a vacuum.  Copy other people's layouts or improve upon them.</li>
<li>Measure your air intake temperature, before and after the turbo.</li>
<li>Find the best gas that you can.</li>
<li>Tune the engine computer to keep your engine from blowing up.  </li>
</ol>

<p>On tuning: one thing the ECU can do is add extra fuel to the mixture, thereby cooling the mixture down.  Admittedly, using fuel as a coolant is not conducive to absolute efficiency but shouldn't be an issue when driving around out of the boost.  As always, less right foot = less gas spent.</p>

<p>All of the above is discussed in Corky Bell's Turbocharging book <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0837601606"" rel=""nofollow"">Maximum Boost</a> - a very entertaining read for geeky people like myself.</p>

<p><em>Following up some time later</em>: I just noticed the specific question about 9.1 static compression ratio running 10 psi of boost.  As an example, my WRX runs 8:1 at about 13.5 psi so, on the face of it, 9:1 with 10 psi seems achievable.</p>

<p>Let's look at one of the <a href=""http://www.xcceleration.com/cr-boost%20101.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">more arguably sensible equations</a> for effective compression ratio (which, as we noted, is still an approximation of fairly complex thermodynamics):</p>

<pre><code>ECR = sqrt((boost+14.7)/14.7) * CR 
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>ECR</code> is the ""effective compression ratio"" and <code>CR</code> is the ""static compression ratio"" (what you started with before adding boost).  <code>boost</code> is measured in psi (pounds per square inch).  Remember, the goal of this equation is to tell us whether our proposed setup is feasible at all and will it be able to run on gas that I can purchase on the street vs. the racetrack.</p>

<p>So, using my car as an example:</p>

<pre><code>ECR = sqrt((13.5 + 14.7) / 14.7) * 8 = sqrt(1.92) * 8 = 11.08
</code></pre>

<p>Using this equation, the implication is that my effective compression ratio is about 11:1 at peak boost.  That's within the bounds of what you could expect to run a normally aspirated motor on with pump gas (93 octane).  And, proof by existence, my car does run on 93 octane just fine.</p>

<p>So, let's look at the setup in question:</p>

<pre><code>ECR = sqrt((10 + 14.7) / 14.7) * 9.1 = sqrt(1.68) * 9.1 = 11.79
</code></pre>

<p>As cited in the reference, 12:1 is really about as far as you can go with a street car so this setup would still be within those limits.</p>

<p>For completeness, we should note that there is also another ECR equation that wanders around the internet that omits the square root.  There are two problems with that function:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>First, that would result in an ECR for my car of 15:1.  That's a bit ridiculous: I wouldn't even want to start a motor like that with street gas.  </p></li>
<li><p>ECR is an approximation anyway: the real answer to the question of ""how much boost can I run?"" is derived from critical factors such as intake air temperature and compressor efficiency.  If you're using an approximation, don't use one that one that immediately gives you useless answers (see point 1).</p></li>

"In what order does it make sense to upgrade suspension components?","10184","","<p>I have recently started competing in autocross. Because of some after-market wheels/tires, which I bought before I started autocross, I can't compete in the Stock class. The class I'm in, Street Touring, mainly allows for suspension upgrades.</p>

<p>I'm not ready yet to put thousands of dollars in to my car, but I would like to make whatever cheap and effective upgrades I can that will be legal in my class, and leave my car suitable as a daily driver.</p>

<p>The logic behind starting with wheels/tires is clear to me: the benefits of other modifications won't make much difference if your tires can't transmit the force to the road. For example, an extra 100hp from a supercharger won't help much if you're trying to channel it through crumby stock tires and narrow wheels. A decent set of wheels and tires is relatively cheap and will have a big impact on handling.</p>

<p>When it comes to suspension however, I'm not sure how to decide what to upgrade first. One thing I'm considering is a strut tower brace, since they only cost on the order of $100 and is easy to install myself. There are also kits that just upgrade springs, or just upgrade sway bars, just suspension bushings, or full suspension upgrades.</p>

<p>My question is: Will there be a benefit to a STB when I still have stock struts/springs/alignment? If not, what suspension component should I upgrade first? If I think that I might, in a year or two, want to install a full suspension kit, does it make sense to spend money right now on a just-springs upgrade?</p>

<p>In case it makes a difference, I'm driving a 2008 Mazda 3s.</p>
","<p>After adjusting the nut behind the wheel, I would suggest the following</p>

<ol>
<li>Swaybars - Keep the car from rolling as much in the corners.</li>
<li>Alignment - Help keep the tires flat</li>
<li>Springs &amp; Shocks - help resist body roll and start to tune the transitional response of the car</li>
<li>Alignment (again) - new ride height and roll will mean new alignment to get the best results</li>
<li>Wheels &amp; Tires - get better grip.  I usually go for partly used road race tires with too little tread for racing but plenty of tread for a season or two of AutoX.</li>
<li>Alignment (again) - make sure you are getting the best out of the new tires</li>
<li>Strut Tower braces (ft &amp; rear) - I put strut tower braces last because until you get better grip, you are probably not going to be getting enough traction to cause enough load to get the strut towers to deform.</li>
</ol>

<p>Tuning a car for handling is part science and part black art.  There are a lot of people who will tell you the setup that works the best for your car, but they often won't agree and won't be the best for how you drive your car.</p>

<p>Once you have settled down on driving style, start making small adjustments to the car and see what works best for you.  Even after 20+ years of AutoX, I usually spend 1/2 each event getting to a consistent, fast as it will go time.  Then I start dialing in tire pressures and such.</p>

<p>My only guess is the new bulb has it's wires reversed in comparison to my old bulb.

"RWD vs FWD advantages and disadvantages","10093","","<p>I want to know the advantages and disadvantages of rear wheel drive and front wheel drive cars
I know that cars with FWD can't drift. Are there any other advantages or disadvantages?</p>
","<p>To this question, there are quite a few perspectives to answer the question from. For example, advantages to the vehicle manufacturer of using transmission + engine types that are already developed and have passed emissions (Notice that manufacturers seem to use variants of the same engine for multiple vehicles) or are lower cost, may not include any advantages or disadvantages this causes the vehicle mechanics such as access to areas in the engine bay. The same can be said about the existence of different trade offs from the consumer's perspective. </p>

<p>To stay on topic, lets look at this from the driver's perspective and ignore the placement of the engine, relative the to the drive wheels[This will have a profound effect on the vehicle as well]. As was pointed out in your original question, the handling characteristics of a vehicle will be affected by which wheels are applying force to the road. To help visualize the differences, let us look at 3 different scenarios, vehicle is accelerating, vehicle is keeping constant speed, and vehicle is decelerating. </p>

<p>Vehicle Accelerating:
While accelerating, the weight of your vehicle is is being shifted to the rear of the vehicle. This effectively reduces the maximum amount of traction available to the front wheels and increases the amount available to the rear wheels. Regardless of your vehicles drive type, there is less traction to change the direction of your car with the front wheels than there would be while maintaining constant velocity. </p>

<p>Front Drive - Because of the weight transfer to the rear, away from the drive wheels, less torque can be applied to the road before the wheels break and begin to spin. In theory this should decrease the the peak acceleration possible for a vehicle under hard acceleration.</p>

<p>Rear Drive - Because the weight is transferred to the rear, onto the drive wheels, more torque can be applied to the wheels before they break and begin to spin. This should increase the peak acceleration possible for a vehicle under hard acceleration. As an interesting sidenote to consider, in a rear drive car at in a the turn, the best way to keep the rear end from sliding out is to shift weight to the rear that requires the driver gently use the accelerator. </p>

<p>Vehicle Decelerating:
The opposite can be said about weight transfer during deceleration. The weight should shift to the front of the vehicle, increasing the the maximum traction available to the front wheels. This will increase the amount of traction available to turn the vehicle using the front wheels. </p>

<p>Front Drive - With more traction available at the front, more torque can be applied before the drive wheels begin to slip. So while decelerating, a Front Drive car will be more able to punch the gas and keep traction on the drive wheels. </p>

<p>Rear Drive - With Less traction available in the rear, less torque can be applied to the drive wheels before they begin to slip. This slipping of the rear wheels outwards is often called oversteer. </p>

<p>Vehicle at Constant Velocity:
While at constant velocity, the weight of the car should be at it equilibrium state and the base amount of traction should be available at all 4 wheels. Once additional power is applied, or taken away, one of the other two states apply. </p>

<p>This is a very simple explanation that only covers a portion of what could be with this question. Here are a few other questions that might be good to consider. I am sure that others here can add additional good questions to ask as well. </p>

"What is the benefit of Forged Internals in an engine? Pistons, etc","10084","","<p>I've heard of these for years and not fully understood the benefits, can someone elaborate? Frequently the vehicles with forged internals have serious boost pressures, but I've also heard of naturally aspirated and / or carbureted engines that have been upgraded.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","<p>Forging is a process where hot metal of the rough shape is then very forcibly squished by exact shape dies, severely compressing the metal or alloy molecules.  There are internal tensions created within the structure, which ultimately resist sheer and tension stresses by having a reserve of counterbalanced ""forces"" due to the myriad of tiny forge-created stress nodes inside.  Dies are not necessary for forging, as any blacksmith or swordsmith is creating similar stresses when beating hot metal with a hammer as it cools.  However, if the part (or sword) is reheated again, much of the gain can be lost as the molecules relax their cramped positions.</p>

<p>There is also quenching, which is taking a metal part that is very near a eutectic (phase change) point and suddenly cooling it in an oil or water bath, perhaps even liquefied gas.  This creates similar strength properties, but should not be considered forging as the gain is shallow and typically does not extend through the part. This typically followed by ""annealing"", which is a very controlled heating and slow cooling process which relieves SOME of the surface stresses that might lead to cracks or shattering. If the part is irregular in size (like a connecting rod with a big end and small end) the quenching process is also likely to cause warping which must be removed, typically mechanically by bending.  I'm not aware of this being used much at all for engine parts.</p>

<p>Most mass-production of engine parts are done with casting, which is unlike forging in that molten metal is ""simply"" poured into a near-shape mold and allowed to cool.  Molecules of the alloy are allowed to move around as they need to, and the part has little internal stress.  This is a less-costly process than forging, as molds are much cheaper to make than forging dies--as well as many other reasons.  Forged parts often start out as castings.  In high-horsepower applications and other cases where RPM and/or cylinder pressures (BMEP) are very high, the added expense of forgings is well worth it.</p>

<p>BMW, Porsche, Corvette, Ferrari, etc. will use forgings where cost is less of a concern vs. performance and perception.  Another cruical bonus, is that parts can be forged with less material for a lower weight, while still being stronger than an apples-to-oranges casting.  This is HUGE in something like a connecting rod (plus a piston), where most failures are NOT due to compression from boost, but from tension stresses fatigue from changing direction after Top Dead Center.  Each entire reciprocating assembly might only weigh a few pounds, but image the stress if you had to throw that away from you and instantly jerk it back to you -- 15000 times a minute, 250 times a SECOND on a literbike or modern F1 engine.  THIS is why high compression, high RPM, high boost engines use forged internals... not so much because of the pressure, but because of the higher tension forces created by higher-weight castings -- forces that are (I think I recall) CUBED with respect to RPM, and squared with respect to weight.  [that recollection might not be exact] ... Going any further in weight reduction suggests materials like titanium or exotic nanoparticle carbon metal composites yadayada, which are far beyond answering your question or my wallet.</p>

<p>ALL of these processes require exact machining afterwords to achieve the proper exact dimensions for bearing fitment and threads for assembly.</p>

<p>Metallurgy is incredibly interesting.  6000 years ago artisans were making swords that still have not been fully recreated to this day. Despite incredible gains in alloy and metal working technology, I still feel the only huge difference between the art of alchemy and the science of metallurgy, is that metallurgy actually works!</p>

<p>I'd love a set of forged Manly or Crower rods for my Saabaru EJ205 project, but $1000-$1400 is likely 4 or 5 times the cost of perfecly serviceable stock parts for a stock vehicle.  I won't even mention the cost of a forged crankshaft.  And then there are these piston things...  [sigh]</p>

","<p>As far as the numbers, <strong>use what your vehicle manufacturer recommends</strong>. There is a reason your manufacturer recommends a viscosity, the main reason is, <strong>the engine is built a certain way and <em>needs</em> that viscosity</strong>. If you put a heavier weight oil in the engine than what is called for, your engine will not get the oil in a quantity it needs, nor in places it needs it. It also drags the engine down some and causes additional wear/stress on the internal engine parts which run the oil pump. If there gets to be too much pressure at the relief valve, some of the oil is bypassed and is not being used to lubricate the engine. None of these things are good. If you put a lower viscosity oil in then the engine was designed for, your engine will lack the pressure it needs to get the oil to all the places it needs to be. For both of these scenarios, there is a domino effect which will increase wear. You may not see it right away, but it will affect the longevity of the engine.</p>

"Does the brake bleeding sequence really matter?","10029","","<p>We've all heard this tip - <em>""start with the wheel furthest from the brake master cylinder and finish with the closest one""</em>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Why?</em></strong> Does the sequence really matter? What exactly happens if we don't keep this sequence?</p>

<p>Does this tip even apply with modern systems, such as double circuit diagonally split brake systems? ABS systems?</p>
","<p>The sequence matters. If you have a lot of air right after your master cylinder for whatever reason, that air can travel to any point in the system. At some point, the hydraulic line attached to the master cylinder will branch to each of the four wheels. As you pump the brakes, the air will propagate down the hydraulic line, and randomly go down one of the branches towards one of the four wheels.</p>

<p>If you start with the wheel closest to the master cylinder and bleed it until there is no air, and then move on to the wheel furthest from the master cylinder (just as an example), as you're pumping the air out of that longest branch you could realistically get more air bubbles in the shortest branch. You wouldn't even get that air out, because you've already bled that wheel and you think you're done with it.</p>

<p>When you start with the furthest wheel, though, you minimize the possibility that you miss air bubbles. This is because when you move from the furthest wheel to the second furthest wheel, you now only have fluid flowing past three of the four branches. There is no fluid that is passing that fourth branch, so there's less chance of air getting in there. Here is a rough illustration:</p>

<pre><code># Rough Image
                        -------
                       |       |
                       |       | &lt;- Master Cylinder
                        -------
                           |
     Closest Wheel  -&gt; ----|
                           |
                           |------- &lt;- Second Closest Wheel
                           |
                           |
3rd Closest Wheel -&gt; ----- |
                           |
                           |
                           |--------- &lt;- 4th Closest Wheel
</code></pre>

<p>So, hopefully you can see via this illustration that if you are bleeding the 3rd closest wheel, there isn't any fluid flowing past the branch to the Fourth closest. However, when you are bleeding the 3rd closest, there <em>is</em> fluid flowing past the Second and 1st closest, meaning that you still need to bleed those when you're done with the third closest.</p>

<p>Edit: As pointed out in the comments, you should always refer to your manufacturer's instructions for the correct maintenance procedure for this and any other maintenance you perform on your vehicle. What I've provided here is just an explanation as to why the rule of thumb exists regarding a standard order for bleeding brakes.</p>

<p>When you drive your car, you are putting wear and tear on basically everything. Driving your car harder (accelerating quickly, stopping abruptly) just adds to the wear you are putting on it. Even just flooring the accelerator from idle puts a lot of strain on everything from the engine to the transmission to the axles (and potentially a differential for RWD and AWD vehicles). Your car is built to handle a lot of pressure and doing this once in a while is not going to cause major damage, but parts will eventually wear out.</p>

"How to save fuel on downhill slopes on a motorcycle: clutch or neutral?","10019","","<p>I have a two wheeler i.e. bike (Honda company, four stroke) which has four gear. While driving my bike, when I come to downhill slopes, I shift the motorcycle to neutral to save the fuel. (The slopes are not very long, so I cant turn off engine because I have no starter to quickly start it :) ). </p>

<p>But one of my friends suggested not to use neutral, but only hold the clutch while the bike is in gear. So I want to ask, what saves the fuel more between these two cases, shifting to neutral, or just holding the clutch?
Or are both of these useless?</p>
","<p>Holding the clutch in is generally not a good idea. The clutch is designed to be used for very short periods between gears, and for holding in first when you are about to pull away. So if you are wanting to coast you should definitely do it in neutral. The difference between these two from a fuel consumption perspective should be marginal.</p>

<p><strong>From a safety perspective, however, I would suggest this would be a mistake:</strong></p>

<p>You are very vulnerable on a motorbike, so using all safety mechanisms at your disposal should be encouraged. Your engine is a safety mechanism when going downhill - you can accelerate out of danger, or you can use engine braking in addition to your brakes in order to slow down safely.</p>

<p>My advice - only use neutral when stationary, and only use the clutch to change gears or to prepare to pull away.</p>

","<p>When you install a hose clamp there are a few concerns to ensure it doesn’t leak. First of all, ensure the hose is in good shape on the inside and the outside. If it is cracking anywhere around there, it will probably leak and before long (if it must hold pressure) it may fail completely.</p>

<p>Second, ensure the hose is sufficiently placed upon the tube it will be connected to. Most of these tubes will have a ridge around it for better sealing. You want to ensure the hose is far enough past this so that the width of the hose clamp will be completely on the rubber and past the ridge.</p>

<p>Third, as alluded to in the second part, ensure that the hose clamp has rubber beyond the end of it. Take a look at these pictures of a before and after. In the first picture, the hose clamp is too close to the edge and has a slow leak because of it. In the second, the hose clamp is moved a little bit and should now seal completely.

(longer stroke, smaller combustion chamber etc.) I know the main differences between Diesel and Gasoline engines(fuel injection - spark plug etc.), but i can't get it in my head why Diesel engines have a higher compression ratio. Is it because they are designed different to have a greater volume?</p>

<p>Let's ask my question in a different way: What do you need to change of the parts in the engine to create a certain compression ratio? Which constructional factors do have influence on the compression ratio?</p>
","<blockquote>

<p>Yes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let's ask my question in a different way: What do you need to change of the parts in the engine to create a certain compression ratio? Which constructional factors do have influence on the compression ratio?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As the name implies, the compression <strong>ratio</strong> is a ratio between volumes of the chamber between bottom dead centre and top dead centre. Increasing the ratio requires changes that are quite fundamental: <strong>longer stroke</strong> and/or <strong>smaller combustion chamber</strong>. Another caveat is that in diesels forces exerted on the piston, its rod, crankshaft and shaft bearings are higher so those components are heavier and sturdier. For this reasons, diesels and gasoline engines are designed separately, share no basic components and it's pretty much impossible to convert one to another. </p>

<p>The most common method of increasing compression ratio on existing engine is to skim the head - that is ""lower the ceiling"" in combustion chamber. This unfortunately makes everything mounted in the head (spark plug and possibly valves) closer to piston when it's in top position, so you have very limited room for skimming before piston starts touching things it's not supposed to touch. </p>

<p>Another problem is that shapes of combustion chambers in modern engines are very carefully designed to achieve good flame propagation and even combustion. So while in theory one could design a simple chamber insert just to occupy some volume and therefore increase the compression ratio, it would totally mess up the combustion (not even mentioning the possibility of it getting lose and wrecking the engine).</p>

<p>After all those ""why it's impossible"" reasons, here's one thing that can and actually is done: Because compression starts only after all the valves are closed, you can <strong>lower</strong> the compression by delaying closure of the intake valve. So, in first part of the ""compression"" stroke, air is expelled back into intake manifold (so no compression actually takes place), then the valve closes and only the remaining part of the stroke actually compresses. This trick is used in so called ""Atkinson cycle"" engines that achieve better fuel efficiency at cost of lower power, eg in Prius. (The extra efficiency comes from power stroke being longer than compression stroke, not from lowering compression ratio.)</p>

<p>Bottom line: by changing intake valve timing you could lower the compression ratio almost all the way down to 1:1.</p>

"What is a ""crank throw"" and how can I determine the number of crank throws on an engine?","9936","","<p>This term is confusing me a little and I wanted to make sure I understood it correctly.</p>

<p>Based on my understanding of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crankshaft"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia article</a>, it looks to me like a <em>crank throw</em> is what allows the piston to translate (or ""throw"") linear motion to rotation of the crankshaft.</p>

<p>Also, what I infer from <a href=""http://what-when-how.com/automobile/firing-order-of-cylinders-automobile/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this article on firing orders</a> is the number of unique crankpin offsets in a complete cycle will determine the number of crank throws that the engine is characterized by.</p>

","<p>There are two basic usages for the term ""<a href=""http://what-when-how.com/crankshaft/crankshaft/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">crank throw</a>"". Both have to do with the crankshaft: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The crank throw is a measure of the distance from the center-line of the main journal to the center-line of the rod journal. This distance could be considered the radius of the crank arm. Twice this measurement should give you the stroke of an engine. </p></li>
<li><p>Due to the basic nature of the distance described above, the crank throw is also considered the rod end of the crank shaft. In most V-8 engines, two connecting rods share a ""crank throw"" and there are four throws to a crankshaft. In most inline 4-cylinder engines, a single connecting rod is on it's own throw and there are also four throws on a crankshaft.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In your examples of either cross-plane or flat-plane crankshafts, both of them have four throws each.</p>

<p>There is such a thing as a <em>split-throw</em> crankshaft. GM used such a crankshaft in their 90° V6 engine. Here is an image of a split-throw crankshaft:</p>

"How much grease when packing wheel bearings?","9913","","<p>My Kia failed its annual safety inspection so I'm going to be replacing the front wheel bearings (both front wheels have top-to-bottom play when up on the lift). </p>

<p>Some people say you should only use enough grease to thoroughly fill the bearings themselves. Others say things like ""you can never have enough grease"" and suggest packing the entire hub full of grease.</p>

<p>I have also read that too much grease can cause overheating and leakage issues. Others say that filling the entire cavity with grease means that there's ""no room"" for anything else in there...such as water (I've heard this is mostly important for boat trailers where the wheels get submerged though).</p>

<p>How much grease is the right amount when packing wheel bearings?</p>

<p>(For reference my car is a 2002 Kia Sportage rear-wheel-drive and it uses the tapered-roller style of bearings)</p>
","<p>You should not need any more grease than what it takes to pack the bearing itself. Packing the entire wheel hub assembly is not only a waste, it's also not wise. When you go to change bearings or repack them in the future, you'll need to clean all of that old grease out. This is not a good idea. As an aside, I pack new bearings which may or may not have been packed in grease from the factory.</p>

<p>To properly grease a bearing, put enough grease in your hand to cover your palm. Since you said it's a taper bearing, place your index finger down through the center of the bearing. Your bearing hand (as opposed to your grease hand) should be facing palm down. The wide end of the bearing should also be pointing down. Squeeze the bearing with your middle finger and thumb to hold it tight. Press the bearing down into the grease on your palm, using your index finger (holding the bearing) as a guide against the side of your palm. Use a motion in which you are scooping the grease off of your palm with the bearing. After two to three swipes, you should start seeing grease push up between the roller bearings. Keep pushing grease up through the same spot until you see fresh grease come through. When this happens, rotate the entire bearing so you can start working on the next portion of the bearing. Keep doing this until the entire bearing is packed. This process tends to use a lot more grease than what you think it would, so don't be surprised. </p>

"2003 Honda Accord Timing Belt Package replacement - necessary to replace all things related to timing belt?","9913","","<p>I brought my car in because the starter died.

(I have a 2003 Accord w/ ~90k miles).</p>

<p>They told me that the timing belt needed to be changed and that they would not just replace the timing belt because the other parts that are in the system (tensioner, water pump, compressor) all are closely. If there's a new timing belt and the tensioner is old, it may cause improper tension and things would start grinding (I'm sorry that I don't have the exact terminology that the Honda Service mechanic used).</p>

<p>So I went ahead and had the entire Timing Belt 'package' (that's the term they used) replaced.  (According to them, the timing belt is suppose to be changed every 7 years or 100k miles.

The tensioner pulley doesn't last very long (only as long as the timing belt, or not as long as two timing belts, at any rate) and the water pump is cheap enough anyway.

"How much disc brake drag is acceptable?","9874","","<p>As far as I know brake pads are supposed to maintain <em>slight</em> contact with the rotor at all times. As usually the only thing pushing the piston back after braking is flex of the square cut seal around the piston (which has quite a short travel path), eliminating drag completely is difficult (and probably pointless). However:</p>

<ul>
<li>When is it safe to say that brakes are dragging too much? For example, should the wheel be spinning freely when you turn it by hand (jacked up, of course) even if there is a slight dragging noise? Should the discs be cool after a calm drive? Should only the wheels be cool?</li>
<li>Is a seized piston the only reason for brakes dragging (if properly sized pads and rotors are installed)?</li>
</ul>
","<p><strong>What is a freely spinning wheel?</strong><br>
Of course, you should be able to spin the wheel by hand, but beneath the brake, bearing and transmission can apply lots of drag. My rear wheels do about 1.5 to 2 turns, my front wheels not more than half a turn when I put them in rotation by hand. 
While it's the same for the front wheel of my mother's car, its rear wheels seem to spin forever.</p>

<p>It's best to compare the left and right wheel to get an idea about the expected drag, furthermore, one can compare the drag before and after removing the caliper as well as after removing the pads. (Pads alone can be seized due to dirt / corrosion, too)</p>

<p>Temperature also gives a good hint on whether a brake is seized or not. Highly seized brakes produce lots of heat, slightly seized ones still a little.
But again, it is not easy to judge if a wheel is slightly seized, as the temperature depends on drive behavior, weather and the car itself. And the bearings and tires also produce some heat.<br>
It is again best to compare right and left side.</p>

<hr>

<p>In my experience, I once had a highly seized brake in the rear which still wasn't noticeable while driving. But after, I could feel the heat on my skin when standing away one meter from the wheel...</p>

<p>I now have a infrared thermometer and measure temperature of wheels and discs from time to time. 
The second time I had a highly seized brake (front), the wheel had a temperature of 100°C (210°F), and the disk of nearly 300°C (570°F) after driving 120-140km/h (75-85mph) for 30min plus driving home at low speed for 5min. The seizes brake was only noticeable while driving at that high speed, as it started to make noise and the car pulled to the side when braking. It was not noticeable when driving in the city.</p>

<p>However, don't be too paranoid. When my rear discs and pads had been replaced, the temperature difference between the discs was 20-30°C, but as the brakes broke in, the temperature difference decreased and now is in the order of 5-10°C.</p>

<p>My left/right discs now differ about 5-10°C in temperature, but when I had my rear discs and pads replaced, both sides differed by about 20-30°C. </p>

In the chemical process either two chemicals were mixed and they generated heat or a rubber softening chemical was used to soften the rubber. The thermal method involved a hot metal iron. The patch is clamped in place intil it has set. The end results were all the same, rather than the repair being glued in place the repair was basically a weld with rubber. Maybe with the cost of tires it is gaining popularity again.</p>

"Why does diesel engine need a warm-up before the start-up?","9862","","<p>When starting up, diesel engine needs approximately 5s before turning the key for ignition. Why is this neccessary and what can be damaged if you don't do that?</p>
","<p>Since diesel engines rely on compression to run and not a spark like a gasoline engine, heat is directly involved in the combustion of the diesel in the combustion chamber. The way this occurs is that when the piston comes up it compresses the air which is in the cylinder. This creates heat. When the engine is cold, a lot of this heat gets transferred out of the combustion chamber and into the cylinder head, pistons, and cylinder walls. Since the engine needs this heat to run, it has to get it from somewhere else. When you first turn the ignition on, there are little parts called <em>glow plugs</em>. These heat the combustion chamber and gets them ready so combustion can occur. The five seconds is required to give the glow plugs time to do their thing. If this didn't occur, you could potentially flood the engine with diesel and it would be a <em>really</em> hard time starting it after that. No real damage would occur, but how long it would take to start (if it ever did start) would be forever (well, it would probably seem that way). </p>

<ol>
<li><p>You have a vehicle that does not get driven enough to keep the battery up to charge against its passive drain.  Common examples would include the summer-only car or the utility vehicle that you only use for heavy hauling.

<li><p>You have ever had a battery fail on you (or worse, your <em>spouse</em>).  Traditionally, this is when most of us tend to buy a charger: immediately after a battery failure in a high stress environment.  It's important to remember that a sudden dip in temperature (e.g., below freezing) can suddenly illustrate that a battery you thought was fine is actually not able to cope.  </p></li>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'm particularly interested in the 2nd scenario. Suppose the car won't
  start and I jump-start it and then buy a charger. How do I use the

<p>You're going to have to make a judgement call.  Is this a fairly new battery that died after a month of sitting out in the cold?  Or is this an older battery that should have worked but for some reason did not have enough juice to get you going?  Or somewhere in between?</p>

<p>Now this is the most familiar version of engine cooling technology where a mixture of coolant solution is run through the engine on to a Radiator and back to the reservoir. Almost all cars and modern high capacity motorcycles use this technology as this dissipates heat MUCH more efficiently.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Tri1e.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Tri1e.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Above is a Water cooled engine where you can see there are two noticeable differences , NO Fins on the cylinder head and a Much Bigger Radiator with massive pipes connecting to the cylinder block.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages and Disadvantages:</strong></p>

<p>The only instance where a manufacturer will use a Oil/Air cooled tech is:</p>

<ul>
<li>To cut down Manufacturing and selling cost of the motorcycle while providing noticeable cooling since motorcycles under 200 CC are generally commuter motorcycles with relatively low compression ratio thus not requiring bespoke Water cooling because they hardly get hot enough to cause damage to engine.They don't even have temp gauges</li>
<li>Low maintenance/Rugged Engine since the oil/air cooled engine requires almost no separate maintenance like regulating coolant level etc and smaller radiator means lesser worrying about debris damaging the radiator.Just change engine oil and oil filter and you are basically good to go.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What to choose between the two?</strong></p>

<p>I don't think there will be an option to choose from a Water cooled engine and an Oil/Air cooled option for the same engine.(I am not 100% sure but that just doesn't make sense). </p>

<ul>
<li>Oil/Air cooled engines are low cost to buy and maintaine.</li>
<li>Almost 0 special maintenance required.</li>
<li>water cooling gives you better hear transfer and keeps engine in peak performance all the time but require separate maintenance.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>

<p>Oil cooling is a term used by manufactures for Oil Assisted Air cooled engines, provides inferior cooling effect but is more than enough for small capacity engines. </p>

"Why is my engine quieter with synthetic oil?","9800","","<p>I just replaced the oil in my 2004 Jeep Wrangler today - I thought I'd give synthetic oil a try because there was a ""Mobile 1 oil and Bosch filter"" deal at my local auto shop.  </p>

<p>Until now I have always used off-brand regular oil and FRAM filters, which have done their job just fine.</p>

<p>After putting the synthetic oil in my jeep the engine seems runs noticeably quieter than it did before.  Is this because of some property of synthetic oil that I don't know about?  And even though I do have very good hearing I am open to the idea that this is just my imagination.</p>
","<p>It's not necessarily the oil.  You've also changed the oil filter you're using.  It's possible the Bosch (either by itself, or in combination with the synthetic oil) allows more flow and better lubrication.  I'm unfamiliar with current Fram and Bosch products though, so I don't know if there's any real world difference between them.</p>

"Bubbling sound from coolant and increase coolant liquid level","9777","","<p>I drive an old Daihatsu Charade 1993. Just 2 days ago, I heard a bubbling sound from the coolant when I turned off the machine. I didn't really care much until yesterday when the car got hot abnormally (3/4 of the gauge, usually 1/4) while idling, though the heat did lessen when the car moving, but it does imply the car has a trouble. Looking back, I guess it has something to do with the bubbling noise I had heard.</p>

<p>When I checked the coolant container I saw the liquid is still at just below max level which is fine, no leaking on the ground as well.</p>

<p>I drove again this morning, the car didn't get hot and I didn't hear the bubbling anymore, so I thought there wasn't any severe problem (I might be too optimistic). However, that symptom came back again just now when I drove for around 10 minutes. This time I noticed the coolant level got even higher, I still don't have any idea why, but surely it wouldn't be the head gasket thingy since I saw no leaking at all.</p>

<p>Now, as I did some research, there is a tendency saying this is a problem with the radiator cap being melt down or not being pressurized enough, but I'm not sure if it exactly is the case.</p>

<p>I think it'd be better to ask on here before bringing my car to the mechanic so I know the scope of the problem.</p>

<p>Please help if you know, any guesses would do.</p>
","<p>I suspect you have a leaking head gasket, you don't have to see the coolant leak because it can leak into the combustion chamber and exit your vehicle in the form of vapor from the tail pipe. It can also leak into the oil so make sure to check the oil for contamination.</p>

<p>It could also be as simple as a bad radiator cap, you can test them with specialized equipment but they are so cheap I'd just replace it and see if the problem goes away. The job of the radiator cap is to allow the coolant system to pressurize to raise the boiling point. If the cap doesn't' allow the system to pressurize or reduces the amount of pressurization it can allow the coolant to boil and could be the bubbles you are seeing.</p>

<p>There is also an easy way to check the head gasket. They make a combustion gas leak detector that detects CO2 in the coolant indicating a leaking head gasket.</p>

"Consequences of a Dirty Intake Manifold","9771","","<p>This is similar to, but not the same as my question <a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/19282/effects-of-dirty-piston-heads-and-intake-valves"">Effects of Dirty Piston Heads and Intake Valves</a>.</p>

<p>Basically, I often see people talking about taking the intake manifolds off older cars to clean them, <a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/a/15857/7132"">or to seafoam them</a>, separate from just trying to get the valves clean.</p>

<p>However, I would think that unless there is a major problem with the engine which has caused a truely massive buildup of gunk then a typically dirty intake manifold shouldn't really be much of an issue.</p>

<p>The only things I could think of would be that maybe a dirty intake could throw off ECU fuel calculations relating to the assumed <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inlet_manifold#Turbulence"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Tau pool on the intake walls</a>, but that would seem to be a pretty small effect I would think.</p>

<p>The other thing I could think of might be clogged EGR passages, but I don't think seafoaming would help with that.</p>

<p>Anyways, what are the effects of a typically dirty intake manifold?</p>
","<h2>Upstream the throttle body</h2>

<p>A dirty intake by itself isn't the problem, but it is a sign of contamination of related components:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>MAF sensors don't take kindly to dirt</em></strong></p>

<p>This will usually lead to the fouling of the hot-wire(s), resulting in the underreading of air mass flow, which will lead to positive fuel trim correction.</p>

<p>If the contamination is bad enough, the engine will feel sluggish and slow to respond.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Throttle plate actuation can be hindered</em></strong></p>

<p>Crud tends to build up on the back of throttle bodies. If bad enough, they will hinder the ability for the actuation of the throttle plate, which can lead to driveability problems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>A clogged EGR hose/valve can throw off fuel management</em></strong></p>

<p>Again, this will show up in fuel trims, albeit not dramatically. The obvious thing to suffer from lack of EGR will be the environment due to increased NOx emissions.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Downstream the throttle body</h2>

<p>The only losses between the throttle body and intake valves will be caused by ductwork.</p>

<p>In almost all situations, the deposits of oil, fuel and dirt will not have a significant impact on pressure drop. I'd expect the performance gains from cleaning this part of the manifold to be minimal.</p>

<p>Of course, the lesser the dirt that goes past the intake valve, the better.</p>

<p>However, the right solution is to ensure that dirt doesn't enter in the first place: Keep the intake tract air-tight and use a good quality air filter.</p>

"How exactly does Sport Mode work in an automatic Subaru Outback?","9713","","<p>I have <b>2008 Subaru Outback (160K miles) with an automatic transmission</b> and have been curious about the Sport Mode that can be shifted into. I read in the car's manual that it increases pickup and is preferable for driving up-hill. I was curious how it accomplishes this, and if it has other consequences as well. (I have googled this, but have found a lot of different and unsatisfactory explanations.)</p>

<p><i><b>As a bonus component to this question,</b></i> I have a bit of a wonky transmission that tends to ""catch"" or ""lurch forward"" when I attempt to accelerate too fast directly after breaking. When I drive with Sport Mode activated it seems to reduce the frequency of this quite dramatically. Why would this be the case? </p>
","<p>Sport mode will ""increase pickup"" by providing a more instantaneous response to throttle inputs. As akadian mentioned, the car will stay in lower gears as you accelerate, allowing the engine to stay in the optimal rev-range for higher torque output. The computer, by activating sport mode, will also not have to 'think' about what gear you should be in for optimal efficiency when you press the throttle, so the electronic throttle and transmission are able to more quickly react to throttle inputs. </p>

<p>As for the wonky transmission: If you haven't changed your transmission fluid/filter in a while, the solenoids that facilitate gears shifts can get 'gummed up,' preventing them from reacting quickly to shift requests from the ECU (engine control unit). This can cause the jerkiness you described, as it is allowing the engine to rev up before the car is ready to accelerate in the desired gear. When the transmission finally shifts, the engine is already accelerating causing it to ""catch"" and ""lurch forward"" as you described. The wonkyness is not as pronounced in sport mode because the transmission will have already shifted down during braking to keep the engine in the optimal power band. </p>

<p>Edit: The ECU will also learn what kind of inputs to expect from its driver over time. If someone else had been driving the car for a while, or multiple people drive the same car, the ECU will expect certain patterns and agressiveness, which can lead to a jerky experience if it assumes incorrectly. </p>

E.g. can you manually or some other way be cranking the transfer shaft while using a hand-held (or pedal driven) clutch simulation so that I know I did everything right before putting the tranny back on?</p>
","<p>You can test the transmission by putting it through the gears while turning the input shaft and examining the output shaft for proper rotation. What I mean by this is, put the transmission in first gear and check the output shaft rotation speed as you turn the input shaft. Next, put it in second gear and again check the output transmission speed. Does the speed seem slower than when you have it in first? Check the rest of the gears, sequentially to ensure the transmission is shifting into the correct gears and the transmission is performing as expected. Put it in reverse to see if the output shaft counterspins. </p>

<p>You cannot test the clutch while off the car. It has to be mounted to the flywheel, and the flywheel needs to be mounted to the engine. </p>

"Popping / Clunking noise coming from rear of vehicle","9695","","<p>What could be causing a popping / clunking sound from the rear end of a 1996 Caprice?  The sound is only present (or apparent at least) after the vehicle has been driven for a while and seems to correlate with the brakes being gently applied or backing up.  Anything I should check besides the differential and the rear drum brakes?  </p>

<p><strong>Update #1</strong></p>

<p>I should mention the vehicle has a torque converter with a higher than stock stall speed that went in with a fresh 4L60E.  There is no torque creep to speak of and there is a bit of a whiplash effect when accelerating from a stop with a heavy foot on the gas.    </p>

<p><strong>Update #2</strong></p>

The noise has changed, but it's still there.  Not as many pops/clunks, and the frequency has slowed, too.  I wonder if the fluid was low enough long enough to damage the rear end?  I suppose it could be age related, too.  It's probably the original rear end, and it has over 150,000 miles on it.  Front and rear brakes appear to be good.  </p>

<p>Or else, whats the particular requirements for a powerbank to have the ability to jump start a car? Capacity? Must be specially designed for that purpose?</p>
","<p>No, you can't. A car battery needs a lot of amps at ~12v, and most USB outlets are rated between .5A and 2A at 5v. Car batteries run in the <em>hundreds of amps</em> at 12v.  </p>

<p>Water hoses often make a good analogy for electricity. Think of amps as the width of the hose, and volts as the speed that the water is flowing at. Your smartphone powerbank is a hose the size of a straw, with a slight trickle of water. Your car battery needs a sewer main with a heavy flow of water.</p>

<p>And it gets worse: depending on exactly how the charging circuit is designed, you could end up having reverse electrical flow (your car battery will be sending voltage and amps to the powerbank), resulting in a damaged charger or worse!

"Overheating & coolant loss in 1998 Subaru Outback","9665","","<p>I'm having trouble with this vehicle overheating, presumably from losing coolant. The problem is very similar to what's described here:</p>

<p><a href=""http://community.cartalk.com/discussion/2285268/98-subi-coolant-overflow-tank-keeps-overflowing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://community.cartalk.com/discussion/2285268/98-subi-coolant-overflow-tank-keeps-overflowing</a></p>

<p>The overflow tank fills up, and coolant spews out around where the host goes into the overflow tank. I'm well aware that this issue is <em>usually</em> caused by a blown head gasket, but I've run a test for combustion gasses in the cooling system and it turned up negative. I'm going to repeat it at least one more time in case the leak is sporadic, but I'd like input on whether there are other causes for this problem, and how to diagnose them.</p>

<p>The usual details for overheating issues:</p>

<ul>
<li>fans work fine</li>
<li>no visible leaks elsewhere, but some of the hoses do look like they're in bad condition</li>
<li>thermostat seems to be opening (coolant is clearly flowing, and I think the vehicle would overheat before the coolant level drops dangerously low if it weren't opening)</li>
<li>coolant is ""clean"" (no oil/sludge/etc.) but does seem to have a small amount of shiny metallic particles in it, suggesting maybe a stop-leak product was used by the previous owner</li>
</ul>

<p>Could it be something as simple as a bad radiator cap or hose to the overflow tank not allowing coolant to return properly? One thing I notice is that, after the vehicle has cooled down, there's a lot of suction (internal pressure lower than atmosphere) when I go to remove the radiator cap, but perhaps that's just because the coolant is low and the air gap between the coolant and overflow prevents the cooling of the fluid from pulling back the overflow...</p>

<p>Ideas?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I tried replacing the radiator cap and cleaning the hose to the overflow tank and the problem remains the same.</p>

<p>One odd thing I noticed is that that overflow tank is not sealed/pressurized at all. On every other vehicle I've seen, the host into the overflow tank went through the cap, and everything was (at least loosely) sealed so that some pressure would build up in the tank, which presumably aids return flow. On this vehicle, the hose just fits loosely through a hole in the overflow tank, and it's completely unpressurized. Is this normal?</p>

<p>Also, I should mention that after the system cools, the radiator cap is very tight and difficult to remove. When I do remove it, I hear gurgling from the overflow tank. It <em>feels</em> like there's negative pressure (lower than atmospheric pressure) in the cooling system before opening it, so my first guess would be a bad cap, but replacing it didn't help. Is there a good way I can test and make sure it's not actually still holding positive pressure in the system? That would definitely explain the return failure, but I don't have any good answer for why there would be positive pressure in the system after it cools. The obvious answer would be combustion gasses getting into the system, but I've run the <a href=""http://www.blockchek.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Block Chek</a> test again two more times and turned up nothing.</p>
","<p>The pressure ended up being positive, not negative - it was not very extreme with the vehicle cool and hard to tell the direction, and I just observed the hissing/gargling sounds. So I took it to a radiator shop I trust and they redid the combustion leak tests, apparently better than I did, and found that the problem is combustion gasses in the cooling system.</p>

<p>Typically, when an auto manufacturer like GM supersedes an older part number, the newer part number will be compatible in place of the older version. I don't know what the older version's color was, but ""amber-colored"" seems pretty common for power steering fluid.</p>

<p>EDIT: Another, more innocuous reason, for changing a part number is they create a new contract with a different manufacturer. To identify the new ""part"" they put a new number on it.

","<blockquote>
  <p>What are examples of designs that mitigate the issues of driving in heavy rain?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The best mitigation is not to drive in it. Most roads are designed with a crown in the road (high spot in the middle), which allows the water to run off at a fairly rapid clip. This helps eliminate standing water to an extent. During extreme rain, this isn't possible and you will run into it from time to time. </p>

<p>The best example of mitigation would be tire tread design. There are three basic tread designs: Symmetric, asymmetric, directional</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Mvpjq.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The asymmetric tire is designed for the best of both worlds. One half of the tire is for dry performance, while the other side is for wet performance as it pumps the water away from the tire. Mind you, both sides work in both situations, it's just that each side does its own job better than the other.</p>

<p>Some vehicles (4x4's with the proper setup) have what is called a <em>snorkeling kit</em>, which basically puts the air intake and exhaust pipes above the roof line of the vehicle:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IXIuc.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""> </p>

<p>This allows the vehicle to traverse water up to the point of where the intake is at. If it goes deeper, it too will suck up water. <strong>Please note, this should only be used in standing or very slow moving water.</strong> As was stated, if you go into fast moving water, <em>it will move the vehicle</em> and it will be swept down steam. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Will the water gets inside the air intake pipe?
  Will it get inside the engine?
  What happens if the engine is flooded with water?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It can get inside the air intake pipe if the intake is low enough and the water high enough. When this happens, if the engine is running, it will suck it up into the intake, right after which will head directly into a cylinder or two. When this happens, the engine will stop as the intake valve closes and the piston starts to head upward. Normally at this point, the air/fuel mixture is being compressed. Since water will not compress, the engine stops <em>dead in its tracks</em>. This is called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolock"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>hydrolock</em></a> (aka: <em>hydrostatic lock</em>). </p>

<p>In severe cases, deformation of mechanical parts can occur, which would at the worst, require a complete engine replacement. This usually depends on engine speed at the time of water ingest. If it's at idle speed, the engine <em>probably</em> won't suffer too much ill effects. It really depends on how long and how far the engine is submerged ... if completely submerged for days, the entire car is most likely going to be shot. If you get to it quickly and the only water in the engine is what was sucked up through the intake, it will probably survive.</p>

<p>If the engine is not physically damaged during the hydrolock process, it takes a little bit to get the engine going again. You would need to remove the spark plugs and rotate the engine, allowing the water to come up out of the hole and/or evacuate down the exhaust pipe after enough revolutions of the engine has occurred. You'd probably want to do this by hand. You'd also need to suck any fluid out of the cylinder which might remain. Next, you'd need to change the oil and filter, as more than likely, some of the water has seeped into the crank case around the piston rings. The only way you'd really know if there was internal damage (if it didn't physically manifest it self, like a rod through the block) would either be through getting all of this done. Through the process of turning the engine over after the spark plugs are removed, if you notice any turning issues, there is probably something mechanical which is bad. With the spark plugs out, the engine should turn over <em>fairly</em> easily. There is some resistance due to cam shaft friction, but other than that, it shouldn't be an issue. You would then try to running the engine. If it runs good, it's in good shape. If it doesn't, you have issues. You could tear the engine down to see, as well, but that is probably overkill at this point, especially if there aren't any issues with it.</p>

"Why do pickups and large SUV's use 4x4 and generally not AWD?","9545","","<p>In almost every case I can think of, the larger vehicles with four wheel power are 4x4, and the smaller ones AWD. As far as my experience goes, AWD is much more convenient, and also works at least as well on ice as 4x4 (at least 4h), and allows a rotational difference between front and rear axles, which 4x4 doesn't. I'm mainly talking about permanent AWD, but I suppose this question can apply also to driver controlled AWD. </p>

<p>So what's the reasoning behind this?</p>
","<p>I really think that it's more of a naming convention issue but there is a marked difference between 4x4 and AWD. </p>

<p>In 4x4 all the wheels are ""guaranteed"" power. Power is sent from the engine to the transfer case and then the transfer case sends it to the front axle and rear axle. The reason I put guaranteed in quotes is because there is such a thing as full time 4x4 where the transfer case has a differential inside that allows slip between the front and rear. If you were to tie a 4x4 to a stump and pull until the wheels broke loose, then just before the wheel start spinning the front axle takes 50% of the load and the rear takes 50% of the load. When the wheels start spinning, at least one wheel in the front and one wheel in the back will start spinning at the same time. This is due to open differentials. </p>

<p>In AWD only one axle is guaranteed power while the wheels are not slipping. These systems tend to have a clutch of some kind that separates the axles. The clutch could be viscus, Subaru tends to use these. When the speed of the front axle does not match the rear the clutch will spin internally and heat up. When it's hot enough it locks the front and rear axles together. When it's cool enough it unlocks again. The clutch could be electromechanical, Mazda uses these. If AWD is allowed then an electromagnetic solenoid turn on half the clutch. When the speed of the axles does not match then second half of the clutch comes on to lock the axles together. The clutch could be built into a differential, Audi uses these. The power is split 60:40 and when a set of wheels starts to slip the clutches redirect power to the other axle. If you were to tie an AWD to a stump and pull until the wheels broke loose, then just before the wheels broke loose one axle will carry 100% of the load. When the wheels start spinning the axle with 100% of the power will spin for a short amount of time until the front and rear axles are tied together. When the axles are tied together the wheels that were spinning will slow down or stop and additional power will be required to break loose all the wheels. </p>

<p>Trucks need the ability to send power to both axles at the same time. This need comes from the fact that the true purpose of trucks is to do work. To quote a comedian ""if you need to haul an airplane up the side of a mountain"" you would use a truck. The guaranteed 50:50 split distributes the power evenly at all times and does not need to come on and off. The 50:50 split also makes sure that the strain is distributed, that neither the front nor the rear axle bare more strain than the other. There is a huge downside to 4x4. True 4x4 <strong>can not</strong> be driven on a dry hard surface for long. When driving there is a small difference in speed between the front and rear axle, especially in turns. This difference in speed builds up and causes the axles to fight each other causing tire scrubbing and jerking the steering wheel. As mentioned above some 4x4 vehicles mimic AWD by also having a differential in the transfer case. This differential can be locked and unlocked to go from part time 4x4 and full time 4x4. A major upside to 4x4 is that it can tolerate a 100% duty cycle. This means that the vehicle can be driven with constantly slipping wheels indefinitely. The transfer case builds no additional heat or bares any additional wear when compared to normal operation. </p>

<p>Some AWD systems can imitate true 4x4 action by positively locking the link between the front and rear axles. If that link is not positively locked then some modicum of slip has to occur before the system reacts. Marketing literature usually says that they react instant. There is no such thing as instantly, only really fast. ""Really fast"" means that for some time, no matter how small, one axle is favored over the other. Also AWD systems can not tolerate 100% duty cycle. Because the systems almost always employ some type of clutch mechanism, a build up of heat and wear will result from continuous use. </p>

"2 Volts on Car Battery","9518","","<p>My car battery has gone completely flat after leaving my car parked up for about a month. Tried turning over the car today, and none of the lights on the dash light up.</p>

<p>Ran a multimeter across the terminals, and it shows 2 volts. This battery is under a year old in age, and has never been jumped before. It is a value brand battery, so cheap and not great. I can jump the car, but I imagine it will put undue stress on the alternator.</p>

<p><strong>Is it even worth my time bringing the battery to the local car parts place for a trickle charge, or should I bite the bullet and get a new battery for roughly 100EUR ?</strong></p>
","<p>Since you have a battery which isn't that old (most batteries have about a five year life span), I'd suggest you put it on a charger and try to recharge it. This will allow the battery to come back to full charge without putting an undue stress on your alternator. You have to decide if the time spent in recharging the battery is worth your time. To me, 100EUR would be well worth my time as long as I have a spare vehicle to utilize in the mean time.</p>

<p>While this episode of having to recharge the battery will have taken a toll on the battery (shortened its lifespan), it will most likely be able to take the charge and will work fine for you for the foreseeable future.</p>

"How does the thermostat work?","9469","","<p>What happens when the thermostat is stuck open or closed?</p>

<p>How does it work?</p>
","<p>Basically, the thermostat regulates the temperature of water/coolant in an engine. When you first start the car it should be closed, essentially blocking the water/coolant from traversing the radiator thus allowing the engine to reach its optimum temperature as quickly as possible. Of course, everybody knows that an overheating engine is bad news but most people probably don't realise that engines HATE the cold.  </p>

<p>This is mainly to do with lubrication. If you think about it, there's a massive amount of friction involved in an internal combustion engine. Without a lubricant, an engine quickly becomes a system of fast moving metal components grinding and seizing up against each other that will actually destroy itself quite rapidly from the inside out.  </p>

<p>Anyway; back to the thermostat. The faster the engine heats up, the faster the oil thins out and gets distributed throughout the block etc. and so on to protect all the moving parts. Now everything is running smoothly but the temperature continues to rise. As the engine begins to exceed its ideal operating temperature, a substance inside the thermostat expands in such a way that the device (and thus a pathway) is forced open, unblocking the radiator and allowing the water to flow &amp; circulate, ultimately bringing the temperature back down to that sweet spot.  </p>

<p>The thermostat continues to expand and contract dynamically in such a fashion, relative to the fluctuating changes in temperature, so as to maintain balance or equilibrium.  </p>

<p>Like all things, thermostats have the potential for failure, particularly with age they can seize up. If it seizes while it's too hot, it stays jammed open. If this is the case, it's pretty much the equivalent of removing the thermostat completely. It will be safe from overheating, but it will take longer to warm up etc. as we covered earlier. Of course, if it seizes whilst cold, it will stay closed and the cooling system will remain obstructed, causing the engine to overheat quite quickly. Either way, it is best to replace the thermostat ASAP in such cases, or even better; in advance as a preventative measure.</p>

"Engine braking with an automatic transmission","9467","","<p>For reference, I've reviewed these three questions:</p>

<p><a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/q/3980/2220"">Manually shifting an automatic transmission?</a><br>
<a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/q/1210"">Does Downshifting (Engine Braking) Cause Extra Wear and Tear?</a><br>
<a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/q/3600/2220"">Is engine braking harmful?</a>  </p>

<p>I drive a (new to me) 2011 Nissan Sentra.  The transmission is automatic, and as with most newer cars, it has overdrive.</p>

<p>I'm always wary of wearing my brakes (and particularly the correlation between braking and gas mileage), so I try to avoid hitting them when it's possible.  If I see somewhere that I'll need to slow down, I try to coast for long enough that I don't have to touch the brakes.</p>

<p>Failing that, I use engine braking to slow down whenever I can.  Here's where I deviate from those questions.  First of all, my engine is an automatic, so the answers relating to manual transmissions seem like they might be missing some critical parts.  Also, I don't have any large hills I'm braking down, this is almost exclusively before / at a stoplight (so that I barely brake, just slow crawl, then accelerate when it changes).</p>

<p>My process is generally:<br>
 - 70-80 mph = coast to 60<br>
 - 50-60 mph = switch overdrive off, RPMs jump to ~3500, engine brake to 25<br>
 - 20-25 mph = shift from ""D"" (assuming 3rd gear here) to ""L"" (assuming 1st and 2nd)</p>

<p>This gets me down to about 10 mph, and I've never seen the RPMs go anywhere close to red line.</p>

<p>My question is largely about the overdrive scenario, and the long term maintenance repercussions.</p>

<p>First of all, my basic understanding of overdrive is that it's a higher gear (or possibly a set of gears with incremental gear ratios?) that the transmission shifts into when the car is going a good pace (40-45+).  With this assumption, I feel that switching it off to engine brake will not damage the transmission, as it's merely downshifting, which is exactly what engine braking is about.  Is this correct?</p>

<p>Additionally, is my understanding of engine braking sound as far as the basic gear shifting is concerned (disregarding the overdrive scenario)?  My belief is that any wear would be on the opposite side of the contact locations in the transmission (since the wheels are pushing the engine, not the other - usual - way), so any additional ""wear"" would be unimportant to the overall life of the transmission.</p>

<p>Finally, and I believe this is <strong>very</strong> important to this discussion: by all accounts (manual, dealership, online), my 2011 Nissan Sentra has a Continuously Variable Transmission.  I don't understand transmissions well enough to comprehend the subtle differences, but I do know the CVT has the option of infinite gear ratios, which means it can't possibly be a traditional ""gear"" transmission.  I apologize for dropping this here at the end, but I don't know enough about CVTs to let that guide my questioning.</p>

<p>Am I damaging my transmission by using engine braking heavily in day to day driving?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zw5no.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>You can see that there are two variable diameter pulleys connected by a <em>very</em> robust belt.  As you say, this <em>theoretically</em> allows for an infinite number of gear ratios.  Practically, there are plenty of engineering and human interface limitations that reduce infinity to a more manageable set of presets.  There is a finite resolution of the pulley adjustment mechanism that allows the engine computer to direct the transmission.  This means that, while not quite infinite, you probably have many many more effective gears settings than the five choices I have in my car.</p>

"bearing noise soon after tire replacement?","9447","","<p>I had my tires (all four) replaced recently, and had an alignment done at the same time.  Soon after I noticed a slight ""warble"" coming from one of the rear wheels.<br>
<strong>Update:</strong> I was in the waiting room while the work was being performed so I'm fairly certain the car didn't fall off the lift or anything like that.  And the mechanic in question was not a new hire.</p>

<p>I thought maybe the tire was misbalanced or the alignment wasn't quite right, so I mentioned it when I next took the vehicle in to have the oil changed.  They're telling me the noise is from a bad bearing.  </p>

<p>... which I suppose is possible.  But it begs the question, why did the noise start after replacing the tire?  (Put another way, why didn't I hear any noise from the bad bearing before I had the tires replaced?)  And several co-workers have since shared similar experiences (at different shops).</p>

<p>So I'm wondering: is it possible for a bearing to be damaged by routine work such as a tire/brake maintenance?  Or is it possible that before the tire replacement the old tire was somehow ""masking"" the problem (and how)?  Or is this just a coincidence?</p>

<p>The vehicle in question is a 2004 Honda Odyssey if that makes any difference.</p>

<p>I should also note that the shop in question is one which I've used for a number of years.  The owner sold the business 1-2 years ago because he could no longer afford health care for his employees; the staff has mostly remained the same (other than normal turnover), but I don't trust the new management nearly as much as the former owner.</p>
","<p>I've had this issue with cars fixed at my past shops. The old tires would mask the sound of the wheel bearing starting to go bad. New tires would suddenly make the sound stand out. Old tires can also affect the wheel bearing if their wear is uneven. They could put uneven pressure on the bearing as the tire rotates.</p>

<p>Could the shop have done it?</p>

<p>There is a slight slight slight chance that they might have warped the hub by over-torquing the wheel nuts. But this is very unlikely and lugs tend to break off before this happens.</p>

<p>Go ahead and replace the bearing and move on. This is a safety issue. Afterwards, ask around and find a mechanic you can trust.</p>

<p>I left my keys in the ignition a few days back and hence my battery drained itself.</p>

<p>It is a 12V maintainence-free battery and I want to charge it enough for just one crank. I found a 16v 1.5A adapter and 12V 4A adapter. They are probably old laptop chargers. Could I use anyone of them to charge it?</p>

<p>I have been reading up about it and have seen cases where the wires have melted due to overheating and there are chances of explosion too. Normally a 14V adapter would be ideal but 12V or 16V should work too right? But I am worried about the Amperage since a heavy current will fast charge and damage the battery.</p>

<p>Personally I feel the 12V 4A adapter might not be able to charge the battery that efficiently,since a multimeter reading shows the battery to be at 11V and a 4A current might be too high. So the 16V seems like a better option. </p>

<p>Plus my multimeter's Amperage measurement is damaged so I have no way to take current reading when connecting the battery to the 16V adapter. But could I connect them without a resistance since the current is only 1.4A and constantly check for overheating? I just need enough for one crank and the battery is new, not even a year old with no corrosions on the terminals or leakage.</p>

<p>PS: I really want to charge it on my own and understand there are risks involved. I'm planning to make a proper battery charger on my own in future, but for now I lack the technicalities involved.</p>
","<p>Your 12v adapter would only be able to raise the battery voltage to 12v, but to charge a car battery fully you would need to raise the voltage to 13.8v.  The 16v adapter would raise the voltage too high and could cause damage.  A 4A maximum current would be fine and would not cause any damage, but you need a 13.8v source. Batteries like NiCd need an accurate constant current to charge them, lead acid batteries (e.g. car batteries) need an accurate constant voltage to charge them.</p>

<p>Not a prayer. If your engine is designed to work without them, then yes. But if it is designed to use them then it absolutely will not run without them. There are so many engine designs out there I'm sure there's one somewhere that doesn't use a device like this, but I am not aware of them. This is only one type of tappet by the way, there's a whole array of other types. Perhaps as an answer to another question, this one is getting big.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How do they fail?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now my knowledge on this gets a little thin. As I understand it, the typical failure for these, causing ""noisy tappets"", is that the cam lobe wears over time, and the clearance between the cam and the tappet is no longer in spec. Many times there is a shim sitting in a recess in the top of the tappet that allows you to set the clearance without having to replace the tappet. I did a little digging and came up with this list of possible reasons your tappets / lifters may fail:</p>

<ol>
<li>Lubrication of cam and/or lifters is inadequate before first startup</li>
<li>New engine is turned over excessively before being initially started</li>
<li>New engine sat too long before starting it for the first time</li>
<li>Engine is not at a sufficient rpm during camshaft break-in</li>
<li>Valve train geometry is incorrect</li>
<li>Valve to piston clearance inadequate</li>
<li>Retainer to seal clearance is inadequate</li>
<li>Valve spring coil bind</li>
<li>Valve spring pressure is excessive</li>
<li>Pushrod tip angularity (at rocker adjuster)</li>
<li>Tight valve guides – inadequate valve guide clearance</li>
<li>Lifter crown radius – improperly ground</li>
<li>Camshaft lobe rake angle incorrect for application</li>
<li>Reversed camshaft rake profile – rakes on wrong side of lobe</li>
<li>Camshaft lobes are cut on too small a base circle – lifters too far down</li>
<li>Connecting rod contacting camshaft – stroker issue</li>
<li>Pushrods rubbing or intermediate contact within the heads</li>
<li>Incorrect valve lash</li>
<li>Rocker arm drag at shafts or trunions (oiling, clearance, etc.)</li>
<li>Loose cam gear retention bolt(s)</li>
<li>Camshaft end play is excessive</li>
<li>Oil quality (inadequate zinc / phosphorus content, incorrect application, etc.)</li>
<li>Contaminated oil (water, gasoline, particulates, etc.)</li>
<li>Oil pressure insufficient</li>
<li>Lifter bore too tight, lifter doesn’t turn or work freely</li>
<li>Lifter bore alignment (cam blank &amp; block manufacturing issues)</li>
<li>Use of used lifters on a new camshaft or in a different block</li>
<li>Mixing the used lifters within an engine, not staying on same lobes</li>
<li>Excessive low speed idle time</li>
<li>Engine sat too long with open valve spring load on the lifters</li>
<li>Incorrect or inadequate heat treat on lobes and/or lifter faces</li>
<li>Valve float – bouncing and/or hammering the lifters on the lobes</li>
<li>Use of ARP fastener lube on the lifters and/or lobes; simply the wrong lube</li>
<li>Using high viscosity lube on lifter shanks; keeps lifters from free turning</li>
<li>Lifters are reground to the point that the original surface hardness has been compromised.</li>
<li>Rocker assemblies have been installed without backing off the adjusters thus jamming the lifter against the lobe due to coil bind or other interference issues.</li>
</ol>

<p>That list comes from here and actually is a list of failure causes for both the camshaft and the tappets. <a href=""http://www.eatonbalancing.com/blog/2012/11/06/camshaft-and-lifter-failure-causes-2/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.eatonbalancing.com/blog/2012/11/06/camshaft-and-lifter-failure-causes-2/</a></p>

  <p>Are they easy to DIY fix/replace?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, I think that depends on the engine you have, how many cylinders and how complex the cylinder head is. Overall, on straight forward engines, with a fairly easy to obtain set of specialized tools, you should be ok if you research what needs to be done first. I would not recommend just diving in with air tools and a tight schedule. Take your time, do your homework, and with the right engine. You should be ok.</p>

<p>There is a whole other category of tappets called hydraulic tappets, or hydraulic lifters. Lets grab a picture:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VMRtB.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VMRtB.jpg"" alt=""Hydraulic Lifter Components""></a></p>

<p>Here's how they fit in your valve train overall:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ok5Fd.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ok5Fd.jpg"" alt=""Hydraulic Lifter Simple Diagram""></a></p>

<p>In this case, it's the same kind of device, but now hydraulic pressure (oil) is used to take up any slack between the valve stem and the cam lobe face. The noise you hear happens when this mechanism for taking up the slack loses pressure from blocked oil paths, etc. If you have hydraulic lifters (tappets) then your first step is an easy one. Try a can of one of the oil additives that cleans the valve train and allows the lifter to get pressure again. I have no personal experience with any of those products, so I have no idea how well they work. Caveat emptor.</p>

<p>I hope that helps!</p>

"How does cylinder deactivation work?","9308","","<p>I am still grinning from picking up a 2007 Chevy Silverado 1500 LT 4x4 with the extended cab. 146,000 miles on the clock and 5.3 liter V8 engine.</p>

<p>It has displays for everything the engine is doing in normal operation, one of which is the mode it's in. When asking for power, it's in V8 mode, and when coasting, braking going down hill without accelerating, etc., it's in V4 mode. There is never a perceptible change in either engine vibration, or engine sound. The reason to do this is obvious, fuel economy. </p>

<p>My question is, how are 4 cylinders shut off for fuel economy without changing the sound or vibration of the engine?</p>

<p>I would think that spark, fuel and compression must be stopped for those cylinders. No fuel or spark so nothing is consumed, and those are easy enough to do. It's the compression I'm wondering about. </p>

<p>Are the exhaust valves left open somehow? But that would change the exhaust note I would think. How is this done?</p>
","<p>The link @cory posted is the description from the service manual. Just a repaste and I'll add some images and additional information.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cylinder deactivation is accomplished by not allowing the intake and
  exhaust valves to open on the selected cylinders by using special
  valve lifters. The deactivation lifters contain spring loaded locking
  pins that connect the internal pin housing of the lifter to the outer
  housing. The pin housing contains the lifter plunger and pushrod seat
  which interfaces with the pushrod. The outer housing contacts the
  camshaft lobe through a roller. During V8 mode, the locking pins are
  pushed outward by spring force, locking the pin housing and outer
  housing together causing the lifter to function as a normal lifter.
  When V4 mode is commanded ON, the locking pins are pushed inward with
  engine oil pressure directed from the valve lifter oil manifold (VLOM)
  assembly solenoids. When the lifter pin housing is unlocked from the
  outer housing, the internal pin housing will remain stationary, while
  the outer housing will move with the profile of the camshaft lobe,
  which results in the valve remaining closed. One VLOM solenoid
  controls both the intake and exhaust valves for each deactivating
  cylinder. There are 2 distinct oil passages going to each cylinder
  deactivation lifter bore, one for the hydraulic lash-adjusting feature
  of the lifter, and one for controlling the locking pins used for
  cylinder deactivation.</p>
  
  <p>Although both intake and exhaust valve lifters are controlled by the
  same solenoid in the VLOM, the intake and exhaust valves do not become
  deactivated at the same time. Cylinder deactivation is timed so that
  the cylinder is on an intake event. During an intake event, the intake
  cam lobe is pushing the valve lifter upwards to open the intake valve
  against the force of the valve spring. The force exerted by the valve
  spring is acting on the side of the lifter locking pins, preventing
  them from moving until the intake valve has closed. When the intake
  valve lifter reaches the base circle of the camshaft lobe, the valve
  spring force is reduced, allowing the locking pins to move,
  deactivating the intake valve. However, when cylinder deactivation is
  commanded ON, the exhaust valve for the deactivated cylinder is in the
  closed position, allowing the locking pins on the valve lifter to move
  immediately, and deactivate the exhaust valve.</p>
  
  <p>By deactivating the exhaust valve first, this allows the capture of a
  burnt air/fuel charge or exhaust gas charge in the combustion chamber.
  The capture of exhaust gases in the combustion chamber will contribute
  to a reduction in oil consumption, noise and vibration levels, and
  exhaust emissions when operating in V4 mode. During the transition
  from V8 to V4 mode, the fuel injectors will be turned OFF on the
  deactivated cylinders. The ignition system secondary voltage or spark
  is still present across the spark plug electrodes on the deactivated
  cylinders. If all enabling conditions are met and maintained for
  cylinder deactivation operation, the ECM calibrations will limit
  cylinder deactivation to a cycle time of 10 minutes in V4 mode, and
  then return to V8 mode for 1 minute.</p>

<p><strong>Cylinder Deactivation (Active Fuel Management)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>General Motors Active Fuel Management engine control
  system has the ability, under certain light load driving conditions,
  to provide maximum fuel economy by deactivating 4 of the engines 8
  cylinders. The engine will normally operate on 8 cylinders in V8 mode
  during starting, idling, and medium or heavy throttle conditions. When
  commanded ON, the engine control module (ECM) will direct the active
  fuel management system and deactivate cylinders 1 and 7 on the left
  bank and cylinders 4 and 6 on the right bank, forcing V4 mode. Refer
  to Lubrication Description and Cylinder Deactivation (Active Fuel
  Management) System Description.</p>

<p><strong>Valve Lifter Oil Manifold Assembly</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The valve lifter oil manifold assembly is bolted to the top of the
  engine block beneath the intake manifold assembly. The oil manifold
  consists of 4 electrically operated and normally-closed solenoids.
  Each solenoid directs the flow of pressurized engine oil to the active
  fuel management intake and exhaust valve lifters. The active fuel
  management oil pressure relief valve, located in the oil pan,
  regulates engine oil pressure to the lubrication system and the oil
  manifold.</p>
  
  <p>When enabling conditions are met for active fuel management operation,
  the ECM will ground each solenoid control circuit in firing order
  sequence, allowing current to flow through the solenoid windings. With
  the windings energized, the solenoid valves open and direct
  pressurized engine oil through the valve lifter oil manifold into 8
  vertical passages in the engine block lifter valley. The 8 vertical
  passages, 2 per cylinder, direct pressurized oil to the valve lifter
  bores of the cylinders to be deactivated. When vehicle operating
  conditions require a return to V8 mode, the ECM will turn OFF the
  ground circuit for the solenoids, allowing the solenoid valves to
  close. When the solenoid valves are closed, remaining oil pressure is
  exhausted through the bleed passages of the valve lifter oil manifold
  into the engine block lifter valley. The housing of the oil manifold
  incorporates several oil bleed passages that continually purge trapped
  air from the manifold and engine block.</p>
  
  <p>To help control contamination within the active fuel management
  hydraulic system, a small replaceable oil filter is located in the
  valve lifter oil manifold oil inlet passage. The oil pressure sensor
  monitors engine oil pressure and provides information to the ECM.</p>

<p><strong>Active Fuel Management Valve Lifters</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When operating in V8 mode, the active fuel management valve lifters
  function similar to the non-active fuel management valve lifters. The
  active fuel management oil manifold solenoids are in the closed
  position, with no pressurized oil directed to the valve lifters. The
  pushrod travels upward and downward to actuate the rocker arm and
  valve. The spring loaded locking pins of the lifter are extended
  outward and mechanically lock the pin housing to the outer body of the
  valve lifter.</p>
  
  <p>When the active fuel management system is commanded ON, the ECM will
  direct the solenoids of the oil manifold to open and direct
  pressurized oil to the valve lifters. Oil travels through the valve
  lifter oil manifold and engine block oil galleries and enters the
  inlet port of the valve lifter.</p>
  
  <p>When operating in V4 mode, pressurized oil forces the locking pins
  inward. The pushrod remains in a constant position and does not travel
  upward and downward. The outer body of the lifter moves upward and
  downward independently from the pin housing. The valve lifter spring
  retains tension on the valve train components to eliminate valve train
  noise.</p>
  
  <p>When the active fuel management system is commanded OFF, the ECM
  directs the solenoids of the oil manifold to close, stopping the flow
  of pressurized oil to the valve lifters. The oil pressure within the
  lifter will decrease and the locking pins will move outward to
  mechanically lock the pin housing and outer body.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The active fuel management engine block incorporates additional
  features to support active fuel management system operation. Engine
  oil pressure is routed to the valve lifter oil manifold assembly from
  an oil gallery in the rear of the cylinder block. Cylinders 1, 4, 6,
  and 7 each have 2 vertical, cast-in-block oil passages . The vertical
  oil passages permit oil flow from the manifold assembly to the valve

"How do electric car transmission systems work?","9251","","<p>How do electric car transmission systems work? Does it have an auto or manual gear concept like gasoline vehicles? As an electric motor can run in any speed (slow), is it necessary to have a clutch?</p>
","<p>I'm sure it can be done different ways, but I'll describe the Nissan Leaf, since it is one of the true electric cars on the market today (not a hybrid gas/electric). </p>

<p>The <a href=""http://livingleaf.info/2010/11/nissan-leaf-electric-motor-and-transmission/"">Nissan Leaf</a> does not use a typical automatic or manual transmissions. It uses a single speed reduction gear with a final drive ratio of 7.9377. The motor itself can spin at ~10k rpm. This gives the Leaf a top speed of around 94MPH. </p>

<p>If you were wondering why a purely electric vehicle doesn't need a ""regular"" transmission, but instead uses the single speed reduction gear, the reason is two fold:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>It doesn't need one:</strong> Typical gasoline (petrol) engines have a very narrow torque band. This requires varying the gearing (with multiple gear ratios) to allow the engine to perform efficiently and propel the vehicle down the road with some amount of respect. Electric motors create torque throughout the RPM range. They can create a large amount of torque from 0 RPM almost all the way through to their maximum RPM (whatever that is for an individual motor). Since almost the entire RPM range for the motor produces usable torque, there's no need for a transmission. Because the motor can produce torque from 0RPM, there is no need for a clutch, either.</li>
<li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> A multispeed electric vehicle transmission would add weight, complexity, friction, and inefficiency to an otherwise simple system, actually robbing the powertrain of torque, power, and efficiency. </li>
</ul>

<p>Another example is the Tesla Model S. It uses a single speed stepdown transmission (if you want to call it that) with a ratio of 9.73:1. Even with this, the motor is fully capable of propelling the car at 130MPH and going from 0-60MPH in ~4 seconds. No need for a multispeed transmission there, either.</p>

"2000 VW Polo struggles to/won't start when engine warm","9222","","<p>My 2000 1.4 petrol polo struggles to start when warm and sometimes will not start, until the engine has cooled down a bit, when the engine is on the hot side of warm.</p>

<p>Embarrassingly, I have lived with this issue for quite a number of years because 75% of the time the places I am going will mean I am away from my car for sufficient time for the engine to cool down. Another 15% of the time, I am driving a short enough distance that the engine will not be too warm for this to be a major problem (the car might start after 1, 2 or 3 times). The rest of time I leave it running if I am in and out of some place in a few minutes. I know, as I said, embarrassing. I have cut out twice in traffic after long driving but luckily the car started after 6 and 3 tries respectively. In these cases where it struggles to start, the starting sound is not the same as when the engine is cold and doesn't inspire confidence. I know nothing about cars. </p>

<p>Anyone know where to start with diagnosing this issue?</p>

<p>Edit: Forgot to mention, car always starts when engine is cold.</p>
","<p>This sounds like a problem with the <strong>coolant temperature sensor</strong>. Don't worry - replacement is cheap and can be done easily by yourself or a friend who worked on cars before.</p>

<h3>Cause</h3>

<p>Cold engines need more fuel to start than warm engines. This is due to the fact that a part of the vaporized fuel condenses at the cold cylinder wall inside each cylinder. This part of the injected fuel is not availble for the combustion process.
Therefore modern ECUs measure the engine temperature (by measuring the coolant temperature) and adapt the ammount of fuel that gets injected during engine start and warmup. This is called <strong>warmup enrichment</strong>. </p>

<p>If the ECU has no valid information about the engine temperature (due to a damaged sensor) the fuel mixture during engine start gets calculated incorrectly. This is not a big deal when the engine is running (worst possible side-effect: higher fuel consumption), but can prevent the engine from starting as the engine reacts more sensitively to changes in fuel-mixture during the cranking phase.</p>

<p>The coolant sensor itself can be damaged, but the same kind of problems can arise from an <strong>unplugged sensor</strong>, from <strong>corroded contacts</strong> or from a <strong>damaged sensor wire</strong> or <strong>insulation</strong>.</p>

<h3>Fixing the problem</h3>

<p>Sensor replacement is very simple and can be done by yourself in 15 minutes:</p>

<ol>
<li>Let the engine cool down (otherwise you could get burned from hot coolant water)</li>
<li>Remove metal clamp holding the sensor connector</li>
<li>Unplug sensor cable</li>
<li>Remove metal clamp holding the sensor</li>
<li>Unplug sensor (this is the part when your hands get wet)</li>
<li>Insert new sensor</li>
<li>Install metal clamp holding the sensor</li>
<li>Replug sensor cable</li>
<li>Install metal clamp holding the sensor cable</li>
</ol>

I got the rotors resurfaced last week at the lexus service center but no improvement. Plus the brake pedal is now set lower and i have to apply more pressure when braking. Should i just get new rotors? Does this shaking cause problems is other parts of the vehicle?</p>
","<p>Your initial symptoms do indeed point to an issue with the brake rotors, but given that resurfacing did not address the issue, it is possible that you have an issue with uneven tire wear or wheels in need of balancing (that or they did a really lousy job of resurfacing the rotors).</p>

<p>As to the brakes requiring more pedal effort after the service, this may be a temporary condition as the brake pads and rotors once again ""bed in"" with one another. If it is not a dramatic condition, you may wish to wait and see if it improves. If it is a dramatic condition, get the car looked at again as soon as possible.</p>

<p>As to your comment that the brake pedal is ""set lower"", this is strange to me. Hydraulic disc brakes should be basically self-adjusting, and should always engage in roughly the same place.</p>

<p>This vibration is not likely to cause any issues in other parts of the vehicle, however, a driver of such a vehicle may consciously or sub-consciously make changes to his or her driving behaviors as a result of the vibration, and this may create a dangerous situation.</p>

Apart from a bumpy ride, is anything really bad going to happen if I don't replace these parts? For example, will this put a significant amount of extra stress on the motor mounts?</p>
","<p>There are two big things which are a detriment to riding on worn out struts and bushings:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Saftey:</strong> Worn struts cause longer stopping times/distances as dead struts allow the vehicle weight to shift (sometimes unexpectedly) during braking. This weight shift is a lot more than when you are using good struts, so braking distances suffer. You also will not be able to corner as well as good struts will allow you, either. You will notice both of these effects if trying to do either over bumpy roads ... the struts will just not be able to allow you to control your vehicle in a safe manner.</li>
<li><strong>Wear on other parts:</strong> The most notable things which worn bushings and struts cause is accelerated wear on the tires. Because the bushings hold the alignment in check, with the tires at the proper angles, when they wear out, it causes extra wear on the tires. Worn struts also allows the vehicle to bounce more, which causes wear on your springs. Springs are meant to support your vehicle's weight, not to bounce uncontrollably up and down. </li>
</ol>

<p>I understand not wanting to put unneeded money into your vehicle, but sometimes if you want to continue to use your vehicle, the smart thing is to replace the worn parts. This doesn't mean you have to replace them with upper tier replacement parts (such as buying them from the dealership), but you should at least get them replaced with whatever you can afford.</p>

<p>I never use the car for anything I couldn't use train, bus or bike for, so if one day it doesn't start at all then I'm happy to sort it out at my leisure. However, I don't wish to do any damage to other parts of the car - so my question is, is a battery of this description likely to be shortening the life of any other components?</p>
","<p>Replace, the battery; your alternator and starter will both be subjected to higher stress if the battery is low.  If you can't replace it immediately put a trickle charger on it when the vehicle is not in use.  (The rare-use scenario you outlined would justify a trickle charger whether the battery is dying or not.  But not all vehicles can be garaged, so that may not be an option.)</p>

<p>Mike's answer isn't complete.  Lower voltage does require higher current draw in the case of a variable resistance load, and cable gauge, etc. dictates the higher the current going across a wire, the greater the voltage drop will be before even reaching the starter motor.  You have a diesel engine, so the higher compression ratio creates a higher load from the get go.  Other components that have a fixed resistance will actually have a lower current draw as a result of the decreased voltage which can cause a different set of problems in electronic components, but those are less likely than the increased wear and tear on your starter and alternator.</p>

"What is crankshaft grinding and why is it done?","9170","","<p>I saw a lot of YouTube videos referring to crankshaft grinding, while watching videos about working on crankshafts. I don't understand what crankshaft grinding does.</p>

<p>If we grind a crankshaft, then how does it stay compatible with the vehicle where the crankshaft was taken from? If it is to make it lighter, then doesn't it invalidate the crankshaft maker's purpose of making it thick and heavy?</p>
","<p>Grinding a crankshaft is a process of removing material from the journals in an effort to refurbish and reuse an expensive, yet vital component of an engine. It is usually done during the process of rebuilding an engine when needed, but also has some performance aspects which come along with the process. </p>

<p>Let's first off describe the anatomy of a crankshaft. The different parts of the crankshaft are:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OpYsJ.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OpYsJ.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<ul>
<li>Main journals</li>
<li>Rod journals</li>
<li>Snout (or nose)</li>
<li>Flywheel mounting flange</li>
<li>Throws</li>
<li>Counterweights</li>
<li>Web</li>
</ul>

<p>The main parts we are working with when grinding are the journals, both main and rod.</p>

<p>During the rebuild process it will be determined if the journal surfaces are within sufficient tolerances to be used as they are or if they will need to be ground. There are several reasons why they may need to do the machining: </p>

<ul>
<li>If the surface of the journal has wear which makes it no longer smooth</li>
<li>If the journal is out of round</li>
<li>If the journal is not square (same diameter at both ends of the pin)</li>
<li>Can also be ground to create more stroke (this would make for another answer, so will not include the details here)</li>
</ul>

<p>If the decision is made to reuse the crankshaft, but machining will be necessary in order for it to work, the machinist will grind part of the top layer of the journal away to make it smooth again. Usually (in the SAE world), the amount taken off is measured in 0.010"" (usually 0.010"", 0.020"", or 0.030"" - depending on the severity of the wear on the journal). Once the journal is ground down close to the final dimensions needed for the process, there is then a finishing process of polishing the journals. This involves using using a long circular piece of emery paper. The process looks like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qKBnY.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qKBnY.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a> </p>

<p>The crankshaft is spun while in the opposite direction and the emery paper is put in contact with the journal. This process creates an ultra smooth surface on the crankshaft, which reduces friction, which improves overall power and torque. </p>

<p>To get the crankshaft to work once again in the engine, you have to take up the excess space which is taken away during the process. This is done by using under-sized bearings (undersized because you are making the journal smaller, not larger - the bearings are matched undersized by negative numbers to match). The bearings are matched to maintain the proper clearances for oil flow at the new diameter of the journal.</p>

<p>The main reason for grinding a crankshaft is as stated, but there are some side benefits to doing the grinding. </p>

<p>First, yes it does lighten the overall weight of the crankshaft, but overall it doesn't do that much to create a huge difference. If you wanted to reduce weight, you'd do things like drill the pins and other things which are better left for another question.</p>

<p>Second, grinding the journals and reducing their overall size. By reducing the size, you have less surface area. Reducing the surface area reduces friction losses imposed by the journal faces. The difference is measurable on an engine dyno. If you are an engine builder doing a max effort, this is definitely one area to look at for creating greater efficiencies and thus making more power/torque. </p>

"What differences between synthetic and dino oil?","9166","","<p>What are the main differences between synthetic and dino oil?</p>

<p>Is one always better than the other?</p>
","<p>A full synthetic oil, as the name states, is ""synthesized"".  By that, they mean it is made in a lab, it is a manufactured product.</p>

<p>Organic (Dino) oil is a product of nature.</p>

<p>So the big difference is the environment in which the oil is made in.</p>

<p>The main selling point on synthetic over organic is because it is manufactured, it is made in a controlled environment.  That means far less impurities and a more consistent product.</p>

<p>Organic oil will be influenced by what it was made from, what was in the ground where it was extracted from, etc.</p>

<p>Another way to think about it is synthetic is an additive process.  They start with nothing and add in the components they want until they get the end product.</p>

<p>Organic oil is a reductive process, they start with an unrefined product and filter out all the stuff they don't want until they have what they want left.</p>

"Is it harmful to drive at high rpms","9151","","<p>Does driving at high RPMs (3000-3500) in a manual transmission car cause any extra wear and tear to any mechanical parts? It obviously hurts gas mileage, but does it hurt anything else?</p>
","<p>It all depends on your definition of high. </p>

<p>In my car, the red line is at 7500 rpm, and that indicates that driving with the revs over this line for anything other than brief periods is expected to cause damage, either through overheating, increased wear, increased loading on bearings, lack of sufficient oil/fluid flow etc.</p>

<p>When driving I have to keep my revs below 3000 until the engine and turbo are at the right temperature, then I typically keep my revs between 3000 and 5000, as that is the best range for it, but you need to look at what your car is designed for.</p>

<p>The maintenance intervals are defined by mileage, so as long as you follow the guidance in your manual on revs your engine should be fine. As Krom commented, your manual will often give a 'green' zone for engine revs - which will indicate where your engine should be running.</p>

<p>Incidentally, running at too low rpm can also cause problems, which is why the green zone may be 1500-3000 or 2000 to 3500 etc.</p>

"What makes a CV Joint make a popping or clicking sound?","9123","","<p>I recently bought an ""old"" 1996 Dodge Dakota. When I turn left in a tight circle, I hear a pop or a click on the front-right side of the vehicle. I was told by the previous owner that it's the CV joint. Sure enough, I was under the car yesterday replacing the idler arm and saw grease sprayed all over the place around the CV joint near the wheel. I didn't inspect it much but apparently the boot is ripped somewhere.</p>

<p>My question is: What makes the joint click? I did a little research online and someone said it's when the grease around the joint goes away and the bearings inside move around. And that when you turn hard, they ""drop"" and that's the pop you hear. Seems like it's a bit of a stretch that I could hear bearings drop over the noise of the engine. So what causes the clicking noise?</p>
","<p>The ball bearings are involved, but the noise isn't because they are dropping. What happens is when the boot splits, the grease starts oozing out (less lubricant) and dirt gets in causing wear. One of the jobs of grease is to take up excess slack in the joint (not that there is much in the first place when it's not worn out). This will quiet any noises out of the joint. If it wasn't there, you'd hear the clicking, but it would be very soft. Now, throw in some dirt/grime and the joint will start wearing faster, creating slop where there wasn't any before. When the wheel is straight, the ball bearings don't move all that much. When the wheel is turned, the ball bearings move quite a bit. When it isn't worn out and the grease is in there, the noise is very much softened and you don't hear it. When it is worn out, the ball bearings will move to a point, then give way. In this process it ""pops"" to the end of it's travel, causing the popping noise you are talking about. </p>

<p>A CV joint will last quite a long time. Most of them die under the circumstances you are describing with the loss of lubricant and protection of the boot from the elements.</p>

"How does the tachometer on my dashboard actually work?","9094","","<p>Recently, I asked <a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/q/25489/14003"">a question about the speedometer</a>, how it works and how accurate it is. But that got me thinking... how does the rest of the dash actually work?</p>

<p>I understand that the RPM measurement is a measure of the rotational speed of a mechanical component (the crankshaft) with respect to time (in minutes), partly thanks to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_per_minute"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this source from Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p><strong><em>How does the tachometer actually work?</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Is there some sort of sensor in the crankcase that can count each rotation?</li>
<li>If so, how does that work?</li>
<li>How does the data recorded from whatever it is that records the data get displayed on the dash? Electrical or mechanical signal?</li>
<li>How is the tachometer needle calibrated to move the right amount and point to the correct number (rather than just spin round in a circle or not move at all)?</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Note:</em> Answers can exclude fancy dashboards such as the new Audi ""cockpit"" dashboard because that's clearly just a computer running bespoke software on an unusually shaped computer monitor. I want answers to explain information about the traditional, needle based tachometer found in the majority of cars (as far as I am aware).</p>
","<p>While i'm not sure if there are mechanical tachometers like speedometers electronic tachometers are quite simple. </p>

<p>An electronic tachometer works like an old analog volt meter. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OmxP5.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OmxP5.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The speed of the engine is converted to a voltage. The voltage is fed to the moving coil. The coil creates a magnetic field. That field of the coil tries to align itself with the magnetic field of the magnets. This causes coil to move against the spring deflecting the needle. By combining input voltage, the number of turns in the moving coil, the strength of the magnet and the strength of the spring a ratio is achieved that the needle will deflect a number of degrees per volt. </p>

<p>Electronic ignitions turn the ignition coil on and off in pulses to create the spark. These pulses directly correlate to how fast the engine is turning. For example a V8 will have four pulses per revolution. These pulses are converted to a voltage with a frequency to voltage converter. There are discrete circuits or stand alone chips that can preform this action. For example GM HEI ignitions commonly tie into the signal wire to the ignition coil to get the RPM reading. </p>

<p>Those pulses were, like in the GM HEI, generated by the ignition module from input of the pick up coil in the distributor. In these systems the timing is controlled an entirely in analog fashion. Fly weights and a vacuum advance control the timing in the distributor. </p>

<p>As ignition systems became more complex the pick up coil was replaced by a crankshaft position sensor and the fly weights / vacuum advance were replaced by a computer. Eventually instead of getting the pulses from the coil the signal came directly from the computer. Even to this day the basic structure and operation of the physical needle in the dash has remain effectively the same, the difference being only where the signal comes from and how the signal arrives at the dash board. </p>

<p>Since the engine computer knows the RPM digitally, in digital dashboards the engine computer sends the information to the dashboard over the network.  </p>

"Repair or replace rusted rear wheel arches on 92 Civic?","9093","","<p>The wheel arches on the rear fenders on my 92 Civic are badly rusted out, which seems to be a common problem. I've seen <a href=""http://www.fixmyrust.com/Category/DR"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">replacements you can weld in</a> at very reasonable prices, but I have no welding qualifications and expect it would be very costly to have a professional install them.

I'm a real beginner at body work so apologies if this question seems stupid.</p>

<p>Here is a picture of the rust damage:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QmDTp.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> This looks like a similar procedure to what I might do:</p>

<p>One thing I noticed in that thread was the claim that filler will wick moisture and promote rusting again. Is this true, and are there any good ways to avoid it?</p>
","<p>I decided to go ahead trying to repair it, and I'm happy with the results. After bending the rusted metal back into shape, I started out using 40-grit sandpaper and a Dremel with a rust removal brush to remove paint and the brittle rust. Then I applied <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_converter"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">rust converter</a> to what remained to prevent it from spreading.</p>

<p>For reconstructing the rusted-out part of the wheel arch, I asked the guy at Napa for advice choosing a filler material, and ended up going with a fiberglass resin. He thought plain Bondo would be more brittle and might break if rocks or road debris got kicked up.</p>

<p>To begin with, I cut (well actually tore) a segment of aluminum window screen and shaped it to match the missing part of the wheel arch:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qsLTu.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I then globbed the fiberglass resin onto sheets of non-stick aluminum foil and stuck them to the screen for the main panel part (not the lip) and let them dry, then removed the foil and applied the resin for the lip directly to the screen with a putty knife. At first, it surface was every irregular:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FtTeB.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>but I repeatedly sanded it down and added more resin as needed until the pits were pretty-well filled and the shape was right. I ended up applying the rust converter again after the final sanding, since I'd exposed bare metal and got a heavy rain before I could finish the work.</p>

<p>When I went to put on the primer (Napa's store brand), I found some remaining pits that were going to look ugly. I tried several unsuccessful ideas for filling them before settling on just spraying the primer on really heavy then sanding it down, which worked our reasonably well:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KYFqU.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>For paint and clearcoat, I used Duplicolor, which matched the original factory color almost perfectly, even with 20 years of wear on it. Here's the final result:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IncxG.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I'm going to wait for the paint to fully harden before I reattach the rubber piece that goes on the lip. That should make it look even better, and protect it. Now I just need to re-paint the adjacent scratched-up panels.</p>

<p>Overall I was really happy with the resin product I used. It's very strong (hard to sand, actually) but not extremely rigid, so hopefully I don't have to worry about it breaking if somebody bumps my car in a parking lot, etc.</p>

"Rough idle when AC is on","9081","","<p>My Toyota Vitz 2007 idles roughly when AC is on. If AC is turned off, the idle becomes much smoother.</p>

<p>This vibration is more visible if I suddenly stop in traffic. As soon as I stop, several rough vibrations occur and then it becomes smoother.</p>

<p>I got the vehicle serviced: cleaned the fuel filter, replaced Air and AC filters, replaced engine oil. But the problem hasn't got resolved.</p>

<p>What could be the reason for ths?</p>
","<p>The symptoms are consistent with deposits in the throttle body. There are other potential causes. These deposits accrue in the intake manifold over time. They build faster with short trips and low quality fuels. Inspection and cleaning of the throttle body would be first thing to look at for this symptom. This engine is equipped with a computer controlled throttle system. It is designed to adjust its opening to keep the idle speed close to 700 rpm regardless of engine load. If to much dirt collects around the throttle blade the system can get beyond the limits of the systems ability to adjust idle speed with the extra load of the air conditioning.</p>

<p>To clean the throttle use a soft cleaning cloth soaked in a solvent. Open the throttle blade carefully. Clean the throttle blade and the surrounding bore. Do not scrub, let the solvent do the work, no scratches are allowed on the polished bore. </p>

<p>After cleaning start the engine and let it idle for at least 20 minutes while the system learns it's new throttle position. This vehicle should relearn on its own. It may need to be revved up and put in gear several times during the learing time.  Note that other designs require tools and procedures to perform the throttle system relearn.</p>

<p>Cautions; </p>

<ul>
<li>These geared blades are very strong and can damage body parts if they activate during cleaning, Make sure the vehicle key is away from the vehicle. Open them slowly and carefully. We use shotgun bore cleaning swabs so we do not have to insert fingers into the blade area</li>
<li>Do not spray solvents into the bore and intake, just soak the cloth.</li>
<li>Do not use metal tools for cleaning, it is easy to cause damage and these units are expensive.  </li>

<p>If indicated, have cleaning done by an experienced technician if at all unsure since it is possible to get injured or damage a very expensive part.</p>

"What is involved to recharge the Air Conditioning System?","9054","","<p>What is involved to recharge the Air Conditioning System? I believe you need a machine to do it, so I am guessing you can't do it yourself.</p>
","<p>Short answer it's not a DIY project. There are many things that need to be checked, specialized equipment, and a mistake can cost you a lot of money.</p>

<p>It's against the law to work on AC without a licence in some areas, so check local laws and regulations.</p>

<p>There are many reasons the AC is not cooling and a little low on refrigerant is one of them. Topping off the system with a DIY can <em>might</em> work. The cars on the road to day are less forgiving to over/under charge of refrigerant. Being off by as little as 3 - 4 oz is enough to have a major performance hit, or no cooling at all. Too much refrigerant will damage the compressor as well, this can be a slow death so you may not even realize your recharge caused the compressor failure.</p>

<p>Refrigerant Oil - Even with the correct equipment it can be difficult to get the oil amount correct. Too little you burn up the compressor, too much can affect the performance or damage the compressor. Using the wrong oil can also damage the compressor. If it's a hybrid with electric AC really don't mess with it,the cost of those compressors run in the thousands and are easy damaged with the incorrect oil.</p>

<p>AC systems don't use up refrigerant and if it's low there <strong>is</strong> a leak. When refrigerant leaks out it takes oil with it, so if you keep topping it off without added oil you'll damage the compressor. Some of the cans have oil in them but that might give you an overcharge of oil leading to compressor failure.</p>

<p><a href=""http://forums.moneysavingexpert.com/showthread.php?t=3843891"">As for this guy</a>, I'd stick to more reputable sources for automotive repair.</p>

"Is cylinder leak down test needed if compression test results are fine?","9048","","<p>If I compression test my engine and the results are fine, could there ever be any need to leak-down test it as well?  IOW, can a leak down test ever fail if the compression test is fine.</p>

<p><strong>RELATED:</strong>  <a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/17768/cylinder-leak-down-vs-compression-test"">Cylinder Leak-down vs Compression Test</a></p>
","<p>Yes it can. The reason is, these are two different tests, done differently, reading different things. To understand this, you need to understand how the tool works for each test.</p>

<p>For the compression test, the test apparatus captures and holds the compression as it builds through several, but counted revolutions of the crankshaft. You will get so much pressure built up on the first revolution, but this will not be the complete pressure. You need to turn the engine over for four or more compression cycles on that cylinder in order to get your reading. <strong>It is important you run the compression stroke the same amount of revolutions for each cylinder to get an accurate reading between cylinders.</strong> There are two main purposes of the compression test: 1) to get a final compression pressure reading; 2) to see the variance between the cylinders after all cylinders are tested.</p>

<p>For the leak down test, a separate air source is used. You put the apparatus into the spark plug hole, ensure the piston is at top dead center (TDC) of the compression stroke (to ensure all valves are closed), then apply the air to cylinder. You then take the reading and see what your leak down % is. (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofSiTGeLXvc"" rel=""noreferrer"">Here is a good video of the procedure</a>) Again, you are looking for overall leakage as well as the difference between cylinders.</p>

<p>The major difference here is, even if you have a cylinder which has a leaking valve, it will still continue to build pressure. The pressure may be less than it should be using a compression tester, but you'll still build pressure because the gauge itself will capture the pressure as it builds. </p>

"2011 Mazda3 airbag disabled for light passenger","9033","","<p>I recently bought a new 2011 Mazda3. Everything about it has been great so far, except one glaring detail. When my 87 pound girlfriend rides in the passenger seat, the ""pass airbag off"" light comes on.</p>

<p>I complained to the dealer and asked them to adjust the seat sensors. They called Mazda, and were told the sensors couldn't be changed.  Officially, the airbag should activate for anything heavier than 66 pounds, but apparently there are multiple sensors and the weight is not being distributed to all of them by my gf's skinny butt. The dealer then suggested she ride in the back, or sit on a heavy plate or something, which was insulting. They passed the buck and told me to call Mazda myself.</p>

<p>Before I wade into that bureaucracy, I want to do more research. I did find a similar complaint here: <a href=""http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/problems/complain/complaintsummary.cfm?odi_id=10402674&amp;prod_id=1035768&amp;cmpt_id=257&amp;type=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/problems/complain/complaintsummary.cfm?odi_id=10402674&amp;prod_id=1035768&amp;cmpt_id=257&amp;type=1</a> But it seems like there was no resolution.</p>

<p>Getting to my questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Am I right to be angry about this and demand action from Mazda? After all, my girlfriend is a 23 year-old adult. She's definitely petite but not the only woman of this weight in the world.</li>
<li>Then again, is an airbag really necessary for someone of her weight? It seems to me someone of lower weight has less momentum in a crash and therefore might not need an airbag, assuming their seatbelt was on. I don't know enough about the science behind this though. (She's 5'-2"")</li>
<li>Assuming I do want the airbag to be active for her, and that Mazda doesn't help me out, is there any way I could modify the seat/sensor myself to make it stay on for her?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> So it's a definite no on modifying anything. I'll call Mazda on Monday and see if I can get anywhere, and also contact the salesman who sold me the car, to see if he can help push anything forward. I'll update this question with whatever happens. Thanks for the help so far!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong> I called customer relations today and explained the issue. All the woman did was to create a case and then recommend I get it serviced ""to check for defects"". I asked her what I should do if it turned out to be a defect with the design, and she said nothing could be done. She did admit there had been a number of similar complaints throughout the past year, so it sounds like a moderately widespread issue.</p>

<p>I will go ahead a schedule a service appointment to have the seat looked at, even though I already know it's a design flaw - that way they can't stall with that option.  After that, I'm not really sure where to head with this. It seems incorrectable, but then my options are only:</p>

<ul>
<li>Put my GF in danger by continuing to drive around with a deactivated airbag.</li>
<li>Give up this car, everything about which I've been loving except this.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both options seem outrageous to me, so I want to keep pushing this - but I don't know how exactly.  Is Mazda legally bound to anything here?  The dealer told me the airbag is supposed to be on for anyone above 66 pounds. Is this law, or just specification? How hard would it be to force a recall? (I'm guessing hard, but not impossible)</p>
","<p>Just thought I'd post how we resolved this issue: my girlfriend eventually figured out that if she pushes her elbows into the back of the seat while sitting, the airbag activates and the warning light goes off. It only seems to be necessary once, and then the airbag is active for the rest of the drive until I restart the engine. Now she just does this whenever I start my car.</p>

<p>So instead of it being just an issue of weight, it's really a combination of weight/skinniness that keeps these sensors higher up in the seatback and to the side from triggering. I'm guessing the height is a factor to filter out children, but I'm not sure why Mazda put them so far apart.</p>

<p>Anyway, given that we found a way to trick the car into saving my girlfriend's life it doesn't feel worth it dinking around with corporate any more - seems like they're not going to care until some unlucky person gets hurt. I at least hope they've taken enough notice to fix the issue in future designs - yo Mazda, not everyone in the US is huge okay?</p>

<li>It peaks in volume around 70km/h</li>
<li>It seems to get slightly attenuated from around 80km/h onwards</li>
<li>It is worse when I have load in the rear (1-2 passengers)</li>
<li>It's a really loud hum, filling the cabin, but with no specific rhythm to it</li>
<li>I can't say for sure that it gets worse or better in turns</li>
</ul>

<p>Some background:</p>

<ul>
<li>About 20k km ago, I put a new set of Pirelli P7s on the rear.  At the time, I wasn't aware that my rear suspension was in need of some work, and the tires accordingly feathered.</li>
<li>I replaced the rear shocks about 7000km ago, but the damage to the tires had already been done.</li>
<li>I have checked all the other recommended sources of noise, including flushing both the transmission and rear diff - this does not seem to have materially improved the noise.</li>
<li>I've had the car for almost 3 years, and do an equal mix of city and highway driving.</li>
<li>I'm in Brisbane, so salty air could be a concern.  To the best of my knowledge though, the car has never done any beach driving.</li>
<li>Also to the best of my knowledge, the car has never done any serious towing (or carried big loads), or gone proper offroading.</li>
</ul>

<p>In summary, I can't for sure pinpoint the noise source to bearings (usual tests like spinning, tugging, cornering have inconclusive results).  I also can't get any consistent idea of how long a set of bearings on the CRV should last.  The tires are definitely feathered (probably about 1-2mm ridges), but I have no idea how much noise they would contribute with all else being equal.</p>

<p>Based on a LOT of other posts on the net, service center and mechanic opinions on this particular issue isn't always accurate, and unfortunately I don't have the money ($500/bearing installed, $150-200/tire) to throw at the problem and hope for the best.</p>

<p>Any advice would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>PS - I am probably skilled enough to install the bearings myself, but they're still $150 a side, and apparently on this particular model there's an issue with getting ABS sensors out of the hub without breaking them, which will add another $50-100 per side potentially.</p>

<p>UPDATE</p>

<p>Ok, I've rotated the tires front to back, and also tested with the spare in the place of the heavily feathered tires in the back.  I found:</p>

<ul>
<li>There is a slight reduction in overall noise, but it is not completely gone.  Whether this is because there might still be a different problem, or whether it is because the feathered tires are now generating noise at the front, but resonating through the cabin, I don't know.</li>
<li>With the slightly reduced noise, I tried the swerving slowly at about 60km/h trick.  The noise seems to dissipate slightly when I veer right, and stays about the same when I veer left.  For reference, this is a right-hand drive vehicle.</li>
<li>The pitch changes slightly between about 60 and 80km/h, after which it drops in volume to about 100km/h, making it difficult to detect.</li>
<li>At 100km/h, it becomes 'rhythmic' - basically coming and going at probably 1Hz or so.</li>
</ul>

<p>UPDATE 2</p>

<p>Just did some more reading on tire wear patterns.  It seems that the guys at the shop describing the issue to me, had their terminology wrong.  What I have, is heel/toe wear, NOT feathering.  It is also not related to my (previously) worn suspension, since that would likely cause diagonal wear.</p>

<p>Would this cause road noise as well?</p>
","<p>So, this is a slightly delayed answer, but the problem turned out to be the bearing.  Immediately after having it replaced, the noise was SUBSTANTIALLY reduced, and I could actually hear the other rear bearing also starting to fail (albeit very faintly).</p>

<p>With the low noise, I'm able to hear some slight tire noise as well as described above, but pitch and volume is nowhere near that of the failing bearing.</p>

<p>Rule of thumb here appears to be, if the noise is overpowering (drowns conversation, high pitch at speed), it's probably a bearing.</p>

<p>As another poster pointed out, the ABS sensors do present a problem - I ended up having Honda do the whole thing for about A$470 (and they even cleaned my car ;-) ).  Compared to some other issues I've had, this is actually a reasonable price to pay.</p>

<p>Thanks again for all the advice!</p>

<p>Kind regards,</p>

"My 2005 Mazda 3 Front Passenger window motor receives signal to go down, but not up","8947","","<p>If you look at the picture below you will see that I took the plastic panel off my door, and separated the motor from the regulator.  After I disconnected the motor that I thought was bad, I connected a new one from Dorman. Turns out that both the old and new one can not go up(even when disconnected from the regulator.  I also checked the switch by connecting it to another window wiring and making sure that window still worked.  </p>

<p>Question is, how do I get the up signal to go from the switch to the motor? I checked all the connectors, and they all looked good to me. Do I need to replace a wire? If so, which one?</p>

<p><em>UPDATE:</em> I also made certain that my fuse is still in tact, so it is not the fuse.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong> I checked the voltage with the multimeter.  There are 11.84 V coming to the switch, and when I go down on the switch there are 11.84 V making it to the motor connector, but when I go up on the switch it drops to ZERO.  The next thing I would think to look at is the relays, and after researching that I think I found where they are supposed to be, which is R16-19 (for all 4 windows) but as you can see in the picture below, I have no relays in the interior fuse box, which is where I would expect them to be.  Where else could they be? What else could cause a perfect connection one way, but zero connection the other?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BUIRw.jpg"" alt=""Interior Fuse Box""></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 3:</strong> Turns out it was that the switch(lower left switch in the picture below) on the driver side door was faulty. I got the window to go back up temporarily when I physically manipulated the switch. I have to go buy a new switch(all 4 of them on the driver door). Problem halfway solved.</p>

","<p>If you have checked another working window, your best bet is to use a multimeter to see which wire carries what voltage for the up and down signals (this is not specific to your cart but relevant for any).</p>

<p>Then check first to see whether the voltage is present at the motor end of the wire. If so, the connection to the motor may be faulty.  </p>

<p>If no voltage present, check the other end. If the correct voltage is there the fault is in the wire. If not, keep working back up the path. </p>

<p>A few weeks a go my mechanic replaced the clutch master and slave cylinder on my Toyota Tacoma 4x4. It drove fine for a week or so. <p>This morning after not driving it for 4 days, I cranked it, fully depressed the clutch pedal and could not get car in 1st gear. I let off brake, allowing truck to move slightly and then I could get in 1st gear. The gear fully engaged within first 3-4% of releasing the clutch, i.e. the clutch engaged immediately.  <p>I drove to my first stop sign, depressed the clutch and applied brakes and came to a complete stop. After that I could not get vehicle in gear.<p>
Somehow, I got vehicle in reverse to back in driveway. I depressed clutch, this time it behaved as if it were still in gear and would not stop. I applied brakes hard turned off ignition. With ignition off and foot off clutch pedal, stick shift moves between first and second gear with no resistance.<p>
I want to have a full understanding of what happening so I can have an informed and intelligent discussion with my mechanic.</p>

<p>What's a likely diagnosis of my symptoms? </p>
","<p>How does the pedal feel? Does it have the same resistance as normal, or does it feel really soft, and go straight to the floor?</p>

<p>If it it the latter, chances are you have air in the system, or a leak - check the fluid level in the reservoir (which should look similar to the brake one, but usually smaller).</p>

<p>If it feels normal, there could still be a small air bubble in the system - This is typically indicated by a small amount of free movement as the air is compressed, followed by a normal feel as fluid is pushed through, meaning that the mechanism works, but does not move far enough to release the clutch.</p>

<p>If it is normal through the entire travel, then I would suspect the mechanical release mechanism, i.e. the linkage between the slave cylinder and the clutch itself. I don't know the design of the Tacoma, but some cars feature a cross-shaft with a release arm attached with a grub screw or woodruff key, and these can break, allowing the shaft to rotate without releasing the clutch. </p>

<p>4T is now the defacto name for motorcycle oil with many manufacturers (Mobile 1, Castrol, etc.).  4T is typically 10w40 with longer polymer chains to deal with the shearing of the transmission.  Since the gears of the transmission are lubricated with the engine oil, unlike cars, the gears can shear the molecules and reduced the effectiveness of oil more rapidly.  </p>

<p>So, 4T Motorcycle Engine Oil, 10w40 is what the manufacturer recommends.  TVS also have their own 'braned' oil that they use in their dealerships.</p>

"Max temperature for studless ice/snow tires on asphalt?","8932","","<p>I realize this is probably a loaded question with no clear-cut ""line in the sand"" answer, but I'd still like to see what people say.  I live 3 hours from Tahoe area, so in the winter it is nice to have true ice/snow tires for going to the ski resorts on the weekends.  BUT... my Mon-Fri drives around home are done at sea level, on completely dry (or rain wet) pavement, usually in the 45-65F range.</p>

<p>I know why it's not a good idea to drive winter tires year round, but I don't see any published specs from tire mfr's regarding what max temp they suggest their tire be used in.  I'm faced with the options of:</p>

<p>a) leaving tires on all winter which at best will cause faster wear on them, and at worst will be a safety concern if I give up traction on wet ""warm"" pavement</p>

<p>b) swap tires every weekend, which is obviously a PITA, though I know at least one person living nearby who does this</p>

<p>I'm aware that performance winters may have been a better solution for my situation compared to ice/snow tires, but I do not want to even give up a tiny fraction of ice performance, after a scary incident I had on ice last year.</p>
","<p>I live in New England. It can snow anytime from Haloween until April 1st. Depending on the year we can get five or twenty-five significant storms a year. Most of the winter the average daytime temp is in the twenties, but can easily hit forty for a few days. Most roads are bare two days after a storm. Everyone I know that does use winter specific tires put them on and leave them on all winter. In your case I would leave them on for the ski season. No maker that I am aware of has an absolute number when they should be removed. You are going to put wear on one set or the other. Although the chance is ,swapping the tires every weekend may be risky. Think in terms of you're running late, your in a hurry,it's dark, did I torque all the lugnuts? Yea sure I did I've done this every weekend for the last 12 weeks.</p>

"does a car normally continue moving at a constant speed when in gear and the foot is taken off the accelerator pedal?","8908","","<p>I remember when driving a passenger car, when I took my foot off the accelerator pedal completely, but remained in gear, the car would normally continue to move at some low speed, different for each gear, more or less constant for each gear (provided the road is flat).</p>

<p>Now I drive a van, and I am surprised it doesn't behave like that. No matter what speed I drive, even if the road is flat, no matter which gear I am in, if I take the foot off the accelerator pedal completely, the van soon comes to a stop, the engine shuts down, and that's it.</p>

<li>OM601.940 4-cylinder 58 kW (79 hp) 2299 dm<sup>3</sup> diesel engine</li>
</ul>

<p>Is it normal for such vans to behave like this? Can something be regulated to make it behave like the petrol/gas passenger car I drove before, which continued moving at a constant slow speed when I took the foot off the accelerator pedal?</p>
","<p>I think the listed stats make it pretty clear: you are driving a heavy van with a fairly low power engine.  More importantly, it's likely that you have a low torque engine which is critical to keep the vehicle rolling.</p>

<p>What you're used to in the passenger car is the same as what happens in the van, just to a lesser degree.  In your passenger car, you were witnessing the engine idler trying to keep the engine from dropping below a target RPM value.  In your passenger car, there was sufficient low end torque to overcome the aerodynamic and rolling resistances of the vehicle.</p>

<p>Clearly, in the van, you have less power available and, likely, a much heavier and higher drag vehicle.  The engine idler is not able to keep the vehicle moving without your input.</p>

<p>Here are three things to try in order to ensure that this isn't a different problem:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Does the van idle smoothly with the transmission disengaged?  If it stalled immediately even out of gear, you might have a problem.</p></li>
<li><p>What happens if you try idling down a shallow hill in the lowest possible gear?  If you take some of the rolling resistance out of the equation, your engine idler should be able to pull you along.</p></li>
<li><p>Are your tire pressures to spec?  If your tires are significantly low, that greatly increases your rolling resistance.</p></li>

"Testing automatic choke on a scooter","8904","","<p>My Peugeot Speedfight 2 is having trouble starting when cold.</p>

<p>I took down the carburetor and cleaned it. The spark plug is also pretty new.</p>

<p>I've read that automatic choke can be faulty but I don't know how would I test that. It is a choke that has an extending needle. I've read up on how choke operates but found only examples of air restricting butterfly valve chokes. So I'm not sure what the needle does in automatic choke.</p>

<p>From my understanding the needle extends and closes the hole when the engine is warm. So am I right in that I can remove the choke, try to start the scooter without it and it should start cold?</p>
","<h2>How the choke works</h2>

<p>The choke of  a scooter consists of a dedicated choke nozzle in the fuel reservoir and two narrow drillings leading to the venturi (the pipe where the air goes through):</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DUwIE.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DUwIE.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>When the motor cranks and the choke is active, the slight underpressure in the venturi sucks in extra fuel through this drillings. When the choke is inactive, a piston (golden) moves down and closes the drillings.</p>

<p>In reality, the choke looks like this, and you can easily recognize the piston, which is the brass barrel with the needle:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NFQOxm.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NFQOxm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Inside the black choke body, there is a small cavity filled with a liquid like oil, and an electric heating element. When power is applied, the oil heats up and expands slowly, pushing down the piston. When power is removed, the oil slowly cools down and retracts the piston.</p>

<p>The choke is directly connected to the alternator, i.e. it only gets power when the motor is running. It takes <em>several</em> minutes for the piston to move from the ""fully retracted"" to the ""fully extended"" position, and the difference is really small, may be 5mm (1/5""). </p>

<h2>How to test it</h2>

<p>This should be clear now. Simply check if the piston moves out within maybe 10min when power is applied. But since it takes so long and the piston moves a little only, you should definitely <em>measure</em> the position with a caliper or similar. And also check if the piston is retracted after an hour of cool-down or so.
Ah, and as first test, check if the choke gets warm.</p>

<p>To apply power, either take a ride or connect the choke directly to the battery. But note that the choke draws about 1A, which can drain a small 7 not fully charged / weak scooter battery. </p>

<p>The choke typically fails in two modes: Either the piston does not retract (choke always inactive)  or it does not extend (choke always active).<br>
And of course, it's also possible it doesn't get power...<br>
Further more, it is rarely possible that the piston does move, but not enough. Then you would need to know the positions for a working choke.</p>

<h2>Driving without choke</h2>

<ul>
<li>If the choke works fine, disconnecting the cable will make it ""always active"". The motor will start fine, but consume more gas and build up more soot.</li>
<li>If the choke is simply removed, the motor will draw additional air from above instead of additional fuel, making the mixture leaner. This makes it even more difficult to start and may cause damage due to the lean combustion. And the additional air didn't go through the filter. Instead, it comes from the dirty, muddy and wet place where the carburetor typically sits...<br>
However, if the choke failed in the ""inactive""-position, you can remove it, put your finger on the opening, (try to) start, and then quickly plug the choke in again.</li>
<li>When the scooter should be driven without the choke, not only the opening should be sealed, but also the entire bore in which the piston moves. This disables the choke and makes it harder to start the motor. But the mixture is fine when the motor is warm.</li>

<p>What do you guys think, and how long do you think I can keep running like this ?</p>
","<p>Have a look at your owners manual if it states a maximum oil consumption. I don't think that 750ml over a whole oil change interval is a lot.</p>

<p>My guess would be that it's more likely an issue with the turbo and investigating if it is shouldn't be that expensive. Essentially you or your mechanic would need to pull the pipes going from the turbo to the intake and check for both play in the turbo shaft and oil accumulation in the intake piping.</p>

<p>As to how long you can drive around like this, well, keep in mind that if the turbo has axial or radial play, the turbine wheels will eventually contact the housing and either shave metal off the housing or blades. In general, engines don't like ingesting metal so you can turn an expensive but straightforward repair into a partial engine rebuild if you wait too long.</p>

<p>Out of ideas.  Thanks.</p>
","<p>The solenoid may still be bad. The solenoid is basically a remote controlled high current switch.  The solid thunk sound of the solenoid does not indicate that it is passing current to the starter. The sound is the bendix being engaged. With the help of an assistant, attach a VOM (volt meter) lead to the batterycable terminal on the starter solenoid. The reading should be very close to battery voltage. Move the lead to the other large terminal on the starter solenoid. Have your assistant attempt to start the car. The reading should be between 10-12 volts. The fact that the lights don't dim at all leads me to believe either the starter has failed to the point that it is not trying to turn so there is no load on the battery or the solenoid has failed so the starter never tries to turn, again no load on the battery. Most auto parts stores will test the starter for free. Even if the solenoid is bad the rest of the starter is still 12+ years old. In my experience a quality solenoid can be half the cost of a rebuilt starter and a quality rebuilt starter will come with a new solenoid.</p>

"Easy way to temporarily disable Check Engine light?","8834","","<p>Does anyone know of an easy way to disable the check-engine light for a bit?</p>

<p>I have a vehicle that I'll be selling soon.  A couple of months ago, the check-engine light came on.  I took the car to the dealer, and they said the codes were 300 and 302, which mean misfiring cylinders.  I spent $500 to have a number of minor repairs completed (sparkplugs replaced, etc).  </p>

<p>This week, the light came back on.  I stopped by an AutoZone for a CheckEngine diagnostic, and the same codes came up as before.  Since 60 days have passed, the dealer won't check the car for free, even though they clearly didn't fix the problem.</p>

<p>The car runs perfectly, so the Check-Engine light is just an eyesore at this point.  Still, I think it will scare away buyers, even though nothing is wrong w/ the car.  Do you know of a way to disable that light?</p>

<p>UPDATE: This is an old question, and I've moved on. I left the Check-engine light as-is, and traded the car in to a (different) dealer; I needed a bigger car for a new baby. I took a hit on the trade-in value because of the check-engine light, but I'm okay w/ it. <strong>Maybe stop down-voting this into oblivion?</strong></p>
","<p>To answer your question: Tools that check the code normally can also clear them (some handheld ones are cheap).  However they only stay cleared until the next warm up cycle that takes the measurement. (Note: emissions testing machines will realize if the code has been cleared and if a good measurement has not yet been taken).</p>

<p>However, the bigger problem is this is completely unethical.  Instead of hiding the engine light, tell the truth.  Show the dealership invoice and explain the situation.  The car might be ""running fine"" but the dealer did not fix all the problems or created new ones.  The check-engine light is not an eyesore, it is an indication that either something is wrong with the engine/system or that a sensor is malfunctioning. </p>

<p>In the meantime, I've found the following information in the repair manual (""HOWTO RESET POWER WINDOW MOTOR""):</p>

<ol>
<li>Remove the power window motor (Hint: Place the matchmarks on the power window motor and window regulator gear).</li>
<li>Connect the power window motor and power window switch to wire harness of the vehicle</li>
<li>Turn the ignition switch ON and operate the power window switch to idle the power window motor in UP side direction for more than 6 rotations or less than 10 rotates (4 seconds or more).</li>
<li>Assemble the power window motor and regulator. (Hint: - Install the motor when the regulator arm is below the middle point. - Align the matchmarks on the power window motor and window regulator gear.)</li>
<li>Assemble the power window regulator and door glass. (Hint: - Never rotate the motor to the down direction until the completion of the window glass installation.)</li>
<li>Connect power window switch to wire harness and turn the ignition switch ON.</li>
<li>Repeat UP and DOWN operation several times manually.</li>
<li>Check if AUTO UP -> AUTO DOWN operates in automatic operation.</li>
</ol>

<p>Do I really need to disassemble everything just to reset the jam protection?? And in point 3, what exactly do I need to do? It says ""> 6 rotations"" OR ""&lt; 10 rotations"" (>4s). That doesn't make sense - this means I can do whatever I want as long as it takese >4s.</p>

<p>And what ""matchmarks"" are they talking about?</p>
","<p>In this case, as the reset procedure requires the motor to turn freely through between 6 and 10 revolutions - without being connected to the window mechanism etc. you prehaps don't need to remove it from the door, but you will need to ensure it is disconnected from the mechanism, and this could be easiest if it is removed entirely. You will also be able to count revolutions etc.</p>

<p>Point 3 is very specific. You need to let it turn between 6 and 10 rotations - which should be 4 or more seconds. I would assume from the instructions that you should <strong>not</strong> let it turn more than 10 revolutions.</p>

<p>The marks mentioned are for your benefit. Before removing, draw on marks to show exactly where the moving parts are relative to each other and to the door. This way you will be able to make sure the motor is back in the correct orientation, and that the regulator and mechanism are in the correct position.</p>

"Is disabling the airbag inflators a task that an amateur can tackle?","8829","","<p>I am getting exhausted by the ongoing news that airbag inflators can malfunction and explode, injuring the driver and front passenger. Most worrying is that nothing in the news says that the replacement parts are perfectly safe (or even close).</p>

<p>It is not that long ago that airbags were a feature reserved for luxury cars. With time airbags became standard on what seems like all cars.</p>

<p>I would be quite content to remove this safety feature from my car. There is a recall on my car, but I'm so far ignoring it. Is disabling, or even removing, the two inflators a task that an amateur can tackle?</p>

<p>Alternatively, do you have experience making such a request at a dealership? Is there anything in the books that would make them decline such a request?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>I found some information regarding the last part of the question. Disabling the airbag is legal, at least in some jurisdictions. This <a href=""https://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/motorvehiclesafety/tp-tp13178-page1_e-181.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">article</a>, from Transport Canada, indicates that they allow drivers to install a switch that turns off airbag inflators. They recommend against such a switch. Installing a switch is a better solution than simply cutting off the power supply and/or control circuity of the airbag inflators, and I suspect it raises the caliber of the technician needed for this task from an amateur to a pro.</p>
","<p>Every vehicle I've worked on has had an airbag fuse you can remove from the fuse panel to fully disable the airbag; the repair manuals recommend pulling this fuse when doing any work in the dash area since there's some risk of triggering the airbags to go off while you're working, which could result in serious injury or at least a significant cost to replace them.</p>

"Does accelerating faster worsen fuel efficiency?","8819","","<p>I've often heard that accelerating harder makes for bad fuel efficiency, but have yet to be given a sound explanation of why.  Naturally this makes me question this advice.  Now obviously when you accelerate harder, more fuel is being pumped into your engine, but you'll sooner get to that cruising sweet spot where fuel consumption is a lot less.  So is the payoff worth it or not?</p>

<p>This question needs some parameters, as obviously if you fly off at the lights only to stop hard in 100 metres, you'll certainly be facing some very bad fuel efficiency.  I'm more talking about lights at the beginning of a long open road, where how you accelerate has no impact on the eventual braking that will have to happen.</p>

<p>I think the crux of this question has to do with power output per fuel input at varying engine RPMs.  I've been thinking about this as my car has very low torque at low RPM, but once it's around 3,000+ RPM it's great (old BMW 320i).  Might it be that my car's engine runs more efficiently at 3,000 RPM, and as such slightly harder acceleration than normal will improve fuel efficiency?  Or am I dreaming?</p>
","<p>As you said the crux of the issue has to do with getting every last amount of energy out of a unit of fuel. You can consider this your total fuel efficiency.</p>

<p>Accelerating your vehicle from rest to 60mph or 100km/h will require a fixed amount of energy based on the weight of the vehicle (excluding wind, friction and rolling resistance).</p>

<p>So you need to utilize your engine in the most efficient way to produce that amount of energy. For example you could just floor the accelerator and rapidly produce the energy required but there is no way for you to know whether that path is more efficient than building that energy over a longer period of time.</p>

<p>To know this you need to know your engine. Specifically you need to know your Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC). The BSFC measures how much energy your engine produces per unit of fuel (usually one gram of fuel). Your engine will have different BSFC at different RPMs and Torque values. You want to run your engine where it has the lowest BSFC (lowest fuel consumption per unit of energy produced). So if you look at the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Brake_specific_fuel_consumption.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">BSFC chart</a> I have linked you will see that for that engine its lowest BSFC value is 206 at about 2100-2200rpm at close to peak torque.This means that this engine runs most efficiently in that operating range. </p>

<p>In general engines run most efficiently close to their peak torque at wide open throttle and at the lowest RPM possible. This range will be different for every engine and vehicle because all engines are different and every vehicle has different parasitic loads. You could probably calculate it for your vehicle if you run the vehicle on a dynamometer to measure the power and then also monitor the fuel consumption and then do a division across the curve to see where the engine was most efficient.</p>

<p>Now that you know at what operating conditions your vehicle is most efficient the difficulty then becomes running your engine in those conditions at all times during acceleration. This becomes difficult with a transmission because the RPM has to rise as your vehicle accelerates.</p>

<p>With a manual transmission what I would do with the above example curve would be to have the accelerator at wide open throttle from 1500-2500rpm and shift at 2500rpm for each gear. I am sure that it is possible to calculate the exact shift points for maximum efficiency but I am not willing to put that much effort into it.</p>

<p>With an automatic transmission this is very difficult because if you try to run the engine at wide open throttle the automatic transmission will extend your shift point up to the high RPM range and you will get very bad BSFC and in turn efficiency. With an automatic transmission you have to accelerate much slower so that the transmission will shift at the appropriate points to keep your engine in an rpm where it can operate at its highest efficiency. Maybe pushing the accelerator at half throttle can achieve this but you would have to do it by feel.</p>

<p>In conclusion I would say the best way to accelerate is to accelerate as fast as possible in the lowest RPM.</p>

<p>Hope this explanation helped somewhat. </p>

"VW Polo 2008 won't go into first gear","8807","","<p>Okay, so yesterday I stopped at a traffic light on my way home from uni. When the traffic light turned green again, and I was to pull away I could not get the gear into first no matter how much I tried. After 2-3 mins I gave up and set off in 2nd gear, which I did for the most of the way home trying not to hold still with the car and thus avoiding to have to use 1st gear.</p>

<p>What do you reckon the issue could be? I have tried for one hour it's simply STUCK, whether you hold the clutch down or not or whether the car is on or off, it doesn't make a difference, it won't go into first gear physically, it's like it's blocked or something. </p>

<p>Also, anyone got a clue how much this would cost me?</p>

<p>Lastly, since i've had to start off in 2nd gear , I try to accelerate more and slowly let go of the clutch and it seems like it's not struggling too much. But I'm sensing it's not good for the car. I've done this about 6 times now. Will have it checked tomorrow but after I make an additional 2 drives. Could this potentially cause worse damage?</p>

<p>Car: VW Polo 1.2E (2008) </p>
","<p>Do you have any problems with 3rd or 5th? (or reverse, if it's next to first)</p>

<p>The usual reason for a FWD car not going into a particular gear is a problem with the linkage between the gearstick and the gearbox, which is usually a series of metal rods with ball-joints between them. There are usually two sets, one connected to the fore-and-aft movement of the gearstick, and one side-to-side. If either set is worn, loose, bent or caught on something it could prevent it from working properly. </p>

<p>If it isn't the linkage, then it's almost certianly something inside the 'box, which will probably mean replacing the entire box - it's rarely cost-effective to try and repair them. You can often get hold of second-hand gearboxes to reduce the cost. If you do have to remove the box, get the clutch changed at the same time, as that'll be a lot cheaper than having to change the clutch in a year or so's time...</p>

<p>Pulling away in second won't damage the car, but will wear the clutch out slightly quicker. </p>

","<p>Using a flare nut wrench (aka line wrench) should be used if it is calling for it.</p>

<p>The reasoning for using a flare wrench over an open ended wrench is that you can grip all sides of the fitting just like you can with a box wrench but the opening at the end of the wrench allows you to slip over the connected hose/line unlike a box wrench.</p>

<p>This allows you to apply more torque with less likeliness of slipping and rounding it off.</p>

"Assembly lube or engine oil when reassembling cylinder heads","8765","","<p>I have read differing opinions on what should be used to lubricate cylinder head parts, such as valves, lifters, camshafts and bearings when reassembling cylinder heads.  Some prefer engine oil while some prefer assembly lube.</p>

<p>Is it vehicle dependent and what are the pros and cons of the two approaches?</p>
","<p>I would not use assembly lube with the valves (in the valve guides), but just oil there. The reason for this is because there is no way to flush the assembly lube out of this orifice like there is in other places throughout the engine. </p>

<p>My preference is to use assembly lube for the rest of the parts. Assembly lube will keep the parts from chafing (wearing against each other) during initial start-up until the oil can do it's thing. As the oil replaces the assembly lube (washes the lube away), all of these parts will be protected. </p>

<p>This approach is not vehicle dependent. The whole idea (as I stated) is to protect the surfaces from chafing on each other. If you are going to run your engine right away after assembly, you can use oil. Oil can give the engine parts enough lubrication to prevent chafing. Oil, however will drain away over time, leaving parts exposed. Assembly lube will stay in place until you start the engine. Personally, I prefer the extra bit of insurance which assembly lube gives you. Think of what could happen if you get side tracked for a couple of days after doing the assembly with oil. You just don't know what might happen, so assembly lube is great choice.</p>

<p>For whichever route you go, if two pieces of metal are rubbing on each other, you'll want to use your lube there. Such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Any bearing surface (cam bearings in your case)</li>
<li>Rocker arm to valve tip (if so equipped)</li>
<li>Rocker arm ball or trunion (if so equipped)</li>
<li>Lifters (all sides)</li>
<li>Push rods (tips)</li>
<li>Cam lobes (cam lube) and bearing journals (assembly lube)</li>
<li>Anything else which looks like it needs it</li>
</ul>

<p>You wouldn't need to put assembly lube on timing belts or chains. You can put oil on a chain if you so desire, but considering how they're made, they should not incur any appreciable wear while the engine is starting up. Belts are usually run dry, so no need there. Besides, they are plenty flexible.</p>

<p>Also, you will want to use a cam specific lube on the camshaft where the lobes <strike>intercept</strike> ride on the lifters (or whatever they are called ... the caps on top of the valves which the lobes ride on). If you don't put the cam specific lube on there, you'll run the risk of these self destructing. Here is the difference between cam lube and assembly lube on a camshaft (assembly lube on the right):</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7iNOH.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7iNOH.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>You want to make sure it's more like grease than oil in consistency.</p>

<p>The last thing to know is, after you run your engine for while, you'll want to change out the oil. Assembly lube (especially cam lube) has a tendency to plug up your filter. Also, as bearings and such break in, you'll have fine metal parts in your oil which you'll want to get rid of. After you have about an hours run time on it, change it out. Then change the oil again at about 500 miles.</p>

Trouble is that I won't be able to give it a full inspection until I actually own it (long story!)</p>

<p>From other questions I've read (e.g. <a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/125/reviving-a-vehicle-that-has-been-idle-for-a-long-time"">this one</a>) It goes without saying that:</p>

<li>Whatever fluids left in in will need draining and their paths cleaning, fluid replacing</li>
<li>Probably need new tires and seals all round</li>
<li>Probably need new discs and pads all round</li>
<li>Probably need new belts</li>
</ul>

<p>...but what other more serious mechanical problems would you expect to have arisen over this period of time?</p>
","<p>As has already been noted, anything rubber will have perished and will need replacing, as will all the fluids and any other normal perishable items (brakes, battery, filters etc). The brakes will have siezed on, and depending how dry the garage was, the interior may have mould and the bodyshell may have gone rusty...</p>

<p>The biggest risk, however, is that the engine may have siezed, depending on how it was treated before it was parked up. </p>

<p>My approach would be as follows (in no particular order):</p>

<p><strong>Brakes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Un-sieze the rear brakes. a 3lb club hammer is useful here. Assuming it has drums on the back, free off the handbrake linkages and grease them. Replace the cylinders and pads and check the condition of the drums.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove the front calipers, check the condition of the disks and replace if necessary. Either replace or re-seal the calipers depending on the condition of the bores. Fit new pads.</p></li>
<li><p>Replace or re-seal the master cylinder (again depending on the bore condition). Check the servo (this is easiest done with the engine working). </p></li>
<li><p>Replace all the rubber hoses and carefully check all the solid lines. I'd use braided hoses on a car like that rather than standard rubber ones. Bleed the system completely with new fluid.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tyres</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Replace all 5. Don't be tempted to keep any that look OK, after that long they will be perished.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Transmission</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Check the condition of the CV joints. They ought to be OK, but you'll probably need to re-grease them and change the gaiters. Same for things like steering joints and track rods.</p></li>
<li><p>Empty the gearbox oil, flush and re-fill with the correct grade. The box should be OK, assuming it was fine when it was parked up.</p></li>
<li><p>The clutch is generally hard to check without removing the box. Once the engine is running, you should be able to tell if it is working... If it is hydraulic, you'll probably need to replace the seals as per the brakes. A cable clutch should be OK, but a few drops of oil run down the cable will help - disconnect the clutch end and hold it up, run oil down it then pump the pedal a few times to work the oil down the cable.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Engine</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Drain the oil and coolant, flush both through and re-fill with water and thin, cheap oil (which you'll replace as soon as it is working!). Remove the plugs and dribble a little oil or diesel into each cylinder, then wait a few days - hopefully the oil will vanish down the bores. Using a socket &amp; bar on the crankshaft end bolt, carefully try to turn the engine. Once it turns freely by hand, connect up the new battery and try it on the starter. Once that turns freely, put new plugs in and try starting it (after sorting the fuel of course...).</p></li>
<li><p>Run it up to temperature watching carefully for any fluid leaks. Check for signs of head gasket failure, water pump failure etc. </p></li>
<li><p>Allow it to cool and check the oil and water condition. Both will be filthy ;) If there are any signs of contamination in either, check why. Once you're happy, drain and flush both again (but refilling with proper coolant this time), then again after about 500 miles.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Fuel</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Any fuel left in it will be useless. Drain the system, replace the filters and any rubber hoses and refill. The injectors will need cleaning, and check none of the pipes have become gummed up.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Turbo</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The seals in the turbocharger will be perished. I'm no expert on turbos, but I presume it'll need dismantling and refurbishment.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bodywork/Interior</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>This entirely depends how well it has been stored. If you're lucky, all it'll need is a good clean. Otherwise it may need a lot of welding and/or replacement interior.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>The most imporant question you need to ask - Why was it parked up in the first place? Chances are, something broke...</p>

<p>I have a car I'm in the middle of re-commissioning that has been parked up since 1992, so I've been through most of those already. Luckily my engine wasn't siezed and the interior is OK, but it needs a fair bit of welding...</p>

I stated something to that effect in <a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/a/16868/4152"">this answer</a>. The engine has a redline where you shouldn't take its speed past. This redline is not the maximum speed which the engine can run, but more correctly the <em>threshold</em> which you shouldn't go past. </p>

<p>In your case, if you are approaching the redline, but not exceeding it, you should not be doing your engine any damage. Theoretically it should be able to handle this. Prolonged use at redline will definitely reduce the longevity of the engine.

Most definitely not. It may mean it will last a week less than what it should have otherwise, or some other arbitrary number. The biggest thing you can do for your engine is to ensure it is properly maintained (as it sounds you are) which includes things like oil/filter changes, air filter changes, and spark plugs (and wire if so equipped).

<li>The headgasket popped in November of last year. I had it fixed by an RMI certified workshop. They skimmed the head, installed a new HG, timing belt, etc. I don't think they did the waterpump.</li>
<li>Before that, the guy I bought it from had the downpipe decatted and the thermostat replaced (he even gave me the old one).</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Symptoms:</strong></p>

<p>So on Sunday we were driving around looking for houses on show and suddenly I notice the temp gauge going up to 3/4. I turn on Torque and it shows the temp is at 112 Centigrade (about 12% above boiling point of water, whatever that is in Fahrenheit). I checked the coolant level and while it wasn't full-full, it was enough to keep the car cool (I know because when the HG went, it only overheated when the coolant was almost completely empty). In an attempt to protect the engine, I turned on the heat on full but only cold air came out. I haven't checked for collapsed pipes. I also don't know the state of the heater core. All I can say is that it was working pretty well up until thursday or friday when I last had the heat on. I wasn't driving fast, I was cruising around looking for a house to buy. I didn't notice any bubbles in the coolant like last time, so I don't THINK the HG is leaking into the waterjacket again.</p>

<p>I suspect a bad thermostat or a blockage of some sort, but I have no solid proof yet. Anyone else have something similar?</p>
","<p>It turned out to be perished radiator caps. I replaced both and the problem went away.</p>

"Prius dash board completely off and engine does not shut down","8593","","<p>I took my 2006 Prius on a trip and at some point I drove for about 15 miles in unpaved road. The road was not really bumpy but it vibrated the car a little. About 10 miles into the ride in the unpaved road, after I pulled over for a 1 hour stop, I started the car again and all lights and the combination meter (with the speedometer, gas gauge, gear indicator...) were not working. All warning lights were not working also, except the check engine light and the turn lights (other lights like high beam, tire pressure, cruise control would not light up again, even when the car was started when the usually flash for a few seconds). I reversed the car and the rear camera was not working either. The central display was still working though, but the Trip information was not displaying the fuel consumption and the mileage since last refill stayed stuck in 113 miles even though I drove for about 100 miles on the way back from the trip. In the middle of the trip I parked and the car would not power off and the key stayed stuck in the slot. I managed to drive the car back to my house, where it will stay stopped for now, and by chance the power button worked to shut down the Prius this time. I have a few questions related to those events:</p>

<p>Since it all happened at same time, are all those problems related?</p>

<p>How to force the car to shut down if the power button is not working? Disconnecting the negative terminal the battery will work or this would make any further damage?</p>

<p>How can I fix the combination meter and the power off button?</p>

<p>Can I used the Torque App with a Bluetooth OBD2 adapter to see the fuel level and mileage?</p>
","<p>The symptoms point to a failed Combination Meter. Besides the speedometer, it also controls the power off button and the dashboard lights (except the check engine light). Apparently it can also be rebuilt, but I could not find how is this repair done. There are some eBay ads of people who do it for about $150. It may resume working randomly. To stop the engine, in case it is not stopping properly, holding the power button for 3 seconds may stop it. I just still don't understand on how the backup camera is not working.</p>

<p>EDIT: Tried the car this morning and it was working normally, except the fuel gauge that was displaying a level of gas higher than I expect (6 of 8 gallons after driving about 250 miles since last fill). If it keeps failing, I will look more on how to fix the Combination Meter.</p>

"Should we wait a few seconds before starting the engine?","8592","","<p>My cousin told me when he enter his car, he put the key to ignition then count to 3 and start the engine.</p>

<p>The main reason of him doing that is to give enough time to fluids (I'm not sure which one) to fill to the engine (I'm skeptic, need more info on this).</p>

<p>He told me that in <em>""ze good ol'days""</em>, car would sometimes fail to start if you directly turn the key to start engine and that even if they does start now, it is still better for the engine to wait a few seconds.</p>

<p>This seems logical (although I doubt it's really something we should matter).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why is it better to wait a few seconds at ignition position before starting the engine?</p>
</blockquote>
","<p>The only type of vehicle you need wait on is a diesel powered one. The reason for that is you need to wait (in most of them) for the glow plugs to heat the combustion chamber. Modern fuel injected cars will keep their fuel pressure after shutdown. It will stay there (usually) for a good 24 hours (<strong>Note:</strong> 24 hours is an approximation. It will take longer in some cars and less time in others for the fuel pressure to bleed off back into the fuel tank). When you turn the key on, the fuel pump will start running. This happens as fast as you turn the key. Oil doesn't start flowing until the engine is actually running, so if you tried to wait for that, you'd be waiting a lot longer than three seconds.</p>

<p>Even with non-fuel injected cars there are no worries. In many older non-fuel injected cars, fuel pressure is not delivered until after the engine is turning over, so no sense in waiting for this to happen either. Cars with carburetors will continue to have fuel in their fuel bowls, so has a ready supply of fuel.</p>

<p>Bottom line, I guess is this: it doesn't hurt anything to wait the three seconds, but you aren't creating any issues by not waiting. There will be no long term effects from starting it right after key insertion.</p>

"What is in fossil fuels that we can't mass produce?","8586","","<p>Since fuel is made up of different molecule chains, my question is what is the reason we cannot create the same molecule structure and be able to reproduce the same structure in a lab so we don't have to run out?</p>

<p>Also as a side note, do fuels have oxygen molecules already inside the chain or do they not receive these molecules until the mixing of the oxygen using valves?</p>
","<p>Oil as it comes out of the ground is a mixture of hydrocarbon compounds that are the remains of deposits of algae and microscopic animals, also called phytoplankton and zooplankton.</p>

<p>Scientists have already created synthetic fossil fuels.</p>

<p><strong>The efforts</strong></p>

<p><strong>1</strong>. There is currently a $300 million dollar (actually much larger) effort in San Diego, California by a company called Synthetic Genomics and Exxon Mobil to use algae to make oil. The lipids, a form of fat, in the algae are a major component of crude oil. </p>

<p>Excerpt from: <a href=""http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2009/jul/15/1n15algae001356-deal-blooms-algae-biofuel-research/?uniontrib"">http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2009/jul/15/1n15algae001356-deal-blooms-algae-biofuel-research/?uniontrib</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A San Diego biotechnology company led by genomics pioneer J. Craig
  Venter has landed a deal with Exxon Mobil that could include more than
  $300 million in funding to develop biofuels from algae.</p>
  
  <p>Venter, best known for his role in sequencing the human genome, said
  yesterday that his company Synthetic Genomics is planning a local
  greenhouse and test facility to study thousands of strains of algae
  from around the globe.</p>
  
  <p>The eventual aim is to engineer algae that would use energy from the
  sun to convert carbon dioxide into oils and hydrocarbons in large
  quantities – a feat that would be prohibitively expensive with
  naturally occurring algae.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As of now the above project has failed and is back to the drawing board.</p>

<p>Excerpt from: <a href=""https://www.technologyreview.com/s/515041/exxon-takes-algae-fuel-back-to-the-drawing-board/"">https://www.technologyreview.com/s/515041/exxon-takes-algae-fuel-back-to-the-drawing-board/</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Those efforts don’t seem to have cracked the code for cheap algae
  fuels. In a new agreement between the companies, Exxon is sending
  Synthetic Genomics back to the lab to do more basic science. It will
  focus now on its namesake technology–synthetic genomics, a relatively
  new science that involves making large changes to genomes, even to the
  point of building whole new ones. The goal remains the same: “to
  develop strains which reproduce quickly, produce a high proportion of
  lipids and effectively withstand environmental and operational
  conditions.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>2</strong>. Chevron has a joint effort with a company called Catchlight Energy to use algae as a raw material for making petroleum. Chevron has also partnered with Weyerhaueser Co, one of the worlds largest forest-products companies to begin using wood waste. Ligno-cellulose found in wood is also a component of petroleum. </p>

<p>Excerpt from: <a href=""http://investor.chevron.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=130102&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=984280&amp;highlight="">http://investor.chevron.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=130102&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=984280&amp;highlight=</a></p>

  <p>Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) and Weyerhaeuser Company (NYSE: WY)

  feasibility of commercializing the production of biofuels from
  cellulose-based sources.</p>
  
  <p>The companies will focus on researching and developing technology that
  can transform wood fiber and other nonfood sources of cellulose into
  economical, clean-burning biofuels for cars and trucks. Feedstock
  options include a wide range of materials from Weyerhaeuser's existing
  forest and mill system and cellulosic crops planted on Weyerhaeuser's
  managed forest plantations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In nature, the only reason it takes millions of years for these organic materials to change to oil and natural gas is that it takes that long for it to be buried to a depth where the temperature and pressure are high enough to convert these materials to petroleum. </p>

<p>In reality, the time it takes to convert these from algae to oil may be less than a few hundred years, and that again is because of the slow change in temperature and pressure in a geologic setting. </p>

<p>Oil has been generated and found in sedimentary deposits as young as 1000 years old, so it does not require millions of years. In an industrial setting this all can be done in a matter of hours or days. </p>

<p><strong>Challenge</strong> </p>

<p>In the lab, organic material can be heated (~320C) up in an inert atmosphere with water under pressure (~150 atm) to simulate the natural processes that take millions of years but take only a matter of days in the lab. This is due to simple thermodynamics, thousands of years at 100 C or a few days at 320C give similar products.</p>

<p>This technique is used to analyse whether immature rocks, if they had been buried more deeply, could produce crude oil. So it can be used as a tool to search for oil reservoirs. </p>

<p>It is not economically viable to do it on a large scale since so much energy has to be put into the system.</p>

<p><strong>Side thing</strong></p>

<p>As for this point,</p>

<p>The chemical composition of gasoline does have oxygen in it such as ethanol blended gasoline or methanol blended gasoline but it can't behave as oxygen. So it needs oxygen from outside, namely air. When these two components are ignited it combusts and releases energy. Basic chemistry.</p>

<p>Here is the reaction happening inside a cylinder during the combustion stroke.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>18</sub> + 25O<sub>2</sub> → 16CO<sub>2</sub> + 18H<sub>2</sub>O</p>

","<p>We had the same problem on a late 2005 W169. Note you do not need to remove the door card if you just want to remove the door lock cylinder and exterior handle.
Once you've loosened the bolt holding the cylinder accessed from the side of the door (On ours it was a T20 - T15 would work but there's a chance of rounding off the head) there is a catch above the bolt head which basically is still holding the cylinder. This needs to be pushed down so it covers the bolt head, this will then allow the cylinder to be pulled out. 
You access this using a thin screwdriver in the same way you undid the T15 and flip the catch down. It pivots from the left over the head of the bolt.
If you shine a torch in the acces, you can just make out the catch.</p>

<p>Refit is reversal, it's useful to practice with cylinder out to make sure the you can reset the catch.</p>

"Proper crank time for auto start to avoid damage/dead-battery","8555","","<p>My '99 Grand Prix has an aftermarket remote-start. When the weather gets around 5°F like it is now, the engine does not start after 0.8 seconds of cranking. The system detects the car is not running after 30 seconds and tries again. If after the third attempt, the car isn't running, it gives up and my remote/fob beeps. Cranking without starting is obviously bad because it <em>drains my battery</em> when I perhaps need it most. The situation is made worse because the battery is less able to function at these temperatures. Thus I'm inclined not to reattempt remote-start too many times in fear of needing a jump. This has already happened once, although I have no way to prove the remote start being at fault.</p>

<p>I would simply increase the crank time, but I'm worried about when it's not that cold out, or when it's very cold out but the engine is already warm. In that case, the car starts almost instantly, so the remote-start would be cranking way longer than necessary. This gives that high-pitched whine or ""whurr"" sort of sound before it stops cranking. </p>

<p>Is that bad? Can I set the crank time to 1.5 or 2+ seconds, even when it may start after 0.2?<br>
Remote-start is very important to me when it gets this cold.</p>
","<p>I would not worry too much about whether you are going to run out of battery power, especially if you keep the remote-start at a .8 second crank time. You will not burn up enough battery juice to cause yourself any issues. Your <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_battery"" rel=""nofollow"">battery</a> has several identifiers associated with it. A common one is <strong>CCA</strong> or <strong>Cold Cranking Amps</strong>. This shows you what the power output your battery has when in a closed state (+ and - are connected to <em>something</em> ... in this case, your starter). There is another term which is called, <strong>reserve capacity minutes</strong> or reserve capacity for short. This explains how long a battery can maintain a certain amount of amperage for the number of minutes specified. For instance, my truck's battery is somewhere around a 75 minute capacity. Your car is probably around 60, unless you have a heavy duty one. If you are only cranking your engine for .8 seconds at a time, you are not burning into your reserve. Once the engine is started, it regenerates this power very quickly via the alternator.</p>

<p>This leads to your questions. Is it bad for your to over run your starter? I will say, it isn't <em>good</em> for your starter, but it shouldn't hurt it. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine_starter"" rel=""nofollow"">Starters</a> have a device located in the tip where the gear is located. It's called an overrunning sprag clutch. The sprag clutch has, by its definition, a one-way bearing in it, which allows it to spin freely in one direction, yet is locked in the other direction. It is there for just the reason you describe. If you engage your starter for longer than you should, the engine starts, and the sprag spins freely allowing the gear to spin without pushing the starter armature. The gear gets spun up a little bit, but the starter itself is not harmed. It's just an awful noise which comes out of it. Not the <em>best</em> thing to do, but is not going to cause it much issue.</p>

<p>As for setting the crank time, I'll give you my suggestion. Depending on how much you can fine tune the time, I would start bumping it up about .2 seconds at a time until you can get it to a point where it might not start on the first of the three tries it will do, but will by the second or third without fail. This would give you the minimal crank time with the best chance of success on the first set of start tries. If you move it up to 1.0 seconds and it still won't start on the first set, put it up to 1.2 seconds, and so on. If your granularity is only .5 second intervals, use that. If you find in the summer months you are hearing the auto start causing the overrun on the starter, bring the start time back down to the .8 seconds. I do not know how hard this is to change, but would bet since you are willing to do it this time, it shouldn't be too hard to accomplish.</p>

I then drove 20 miles home to my house, pulled out my scan tool and discovered I had a misfire in cylinder 7. Next I cleared the code and drove about 20 miles the next day and at the very end of the day the check engine light came back on same code.</p>

<p>I switched the coil packs on cylinder 1 and 7 cleared the code and let the car idle. The misfire in cylinder 7 code quickly reappeared. Next I felt the fuel injector and verified it was working.

"Is it necessary to have the wheels of a car aligned with the body when parked, due to weight on the axle?","8545","","<p>My uncle says a driver advised him that whenever the car is parked, the wheels have to be aligned with the body of the car, or else there will be un-necessary weight on (I think) the axle or wheel, which reduces the life of the parts.  </p>

<p>So is it really bad to park with the wheels at an angle as shown in the image below? Seems quite impractical to me, because while parking, the wheels inevitably do end up at an angle and a friend tells me the steering wheel should not be turned when the vehicle is stationary as that puts too much strain on the parts. Moving the car forward and backward just to get the wheels aligned expends extra fuel too.  </p>

","<p>Not at all, in fact there are many occasions when you would want the tires at an angle to the body of the car. Any time you're parked on a hill it is prudent to angle the wheels of the car so that if the parking brake failed to hold the car would run into the curb.</p>

<p>If the wheels were aligned with the body when parked on a hill the car would be free to roll down the hill until it collided with something. That could be bad…</p>

<p>One more thing: if there is an increased load due to the wheels being turned, it is likely to be <strong>far</strong> less than the load imposed when the wheels are turned in normal driving (as then the car is turning and moving with forces imposed both by bumps and the act of turning). So even if the driver informing your uncle is correct about the load, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on the life of the vehicle – not to mention needing to balance that impact against the impact of turning the wheels while the car is stationary.</p>

<p>Brake imbalance is caused because one side of the braking pair (front or back axle) is not applying as much power as the other side. </p>

<p>There are too many answers for this forum. It could be any number of things like a sticking caliper, or a worn pad, or air in the lines. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What does the 23% mean?</p>

<p>When the braking force for each side is measured, one side has 23% more stopping power than the other. I believe for the MOT it must be within 25% in order to pass.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How can I fix it?</p>

<p>It all depends on what the problem is and what type of brakes are being used. Without more information, like your brake type and what mechanically has been done recently, it would be hard to give you a good answer here.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Will it affect the braking of the car?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes it does affect the braking of your car. At 23% you can probably feel it pull to which ever side is stronger, but not bad enough you'd lose control of the vehicle. If you have disk brakes there is little you can do about it but check to ensure the calipers are working correctly, you have good and even pads, the rotors aren't worn out, and that the calipers slide correctly.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If you are happy and don't feel there is any issue, you can leave it. MOT says it's just an advisory, so no worries there (this year). Personally, I'd want the bias down below 10%, so would try to figure out what the issue might be.</p>

"Will a battery reset improve fuel consumption?","8528","","<p>I recently bought a used 2003 Opel(Vauxhall) Astra G 1.4. I drove around 2000km's in the last few months (city and highway mixed), and I used about 200 litres of gasoline, which means a 10l/100km consumption. This seems a little bit too much, and it might be because I'm really a new to driving. According to other sites, consumption should be much lower (around 6-8l/100km). </p>

<p>A friend, who also has the same car told me, that it probably consumes more, because I have not reset the car when I bought, and it is ""not used"" to my driving style. He told me to take the battery out, and put it back 20 minutes later, then drive around in low traffic for 20 minutes. Would this really cause better settings in fuel consumption?

<p>Thanks for every answer in advance!</p>

<p>UPDATE: Yesterday I did the ECU restart by taking out the battery, I can't say too much about consumption yet, but the first thing I noticed was that acceleration in 1st gear was smoother than before. So it definitely had some effect. I'll update again when I have enough data about fuel.</p>

<p>UPDATE #2: In the last days I used ~25-26 litres at 270km's, so it didn't really change (it was the same ratio of city/highway than before)</p>
","<p>Yes, a reset <em>could</em> work, <em>if</em> the problem is that the ECU is used to the previous driver's driving style and his style was vastly different to your's. But it could also just be the way you drive. Do you drive more like Morgan Freeman or Vin Diesel? These cars are quite heavy on the juice in city driving. With mine, I get about 7.5l/100km on the highway going 110km/h(70mph), but in town it goes up to 13l/100km. It really does depend on how much time you spend going slow in lower gears versus going fast in top gear.</p>

He said the timing valve had sprung a leak and fixing it would be an 8-10 hour job, which was really not worth fixing up in his opinion. 
If I buy a few quarts of the same oil and keep adding it if I feel the level is low (he recommended checking it every week), would that be okay?</p>

<p>-Craig</p>
","<p>I'm only familiar with my cars (and not at all with Hondas), but on both of my cars oil loss of up to 1 qt every 1000 miles is still considered ""within specification"".</p>

<p>Even if your car isn't visibly leaking/dripping oil it's always wise to do a weekly oil level check.  Even a new car can suddenly start using/leaking oil.  If something does start happening, hopefully one can catch it before it's a big deal.</p>

"How to determine by ear which part of exhaust needs replacing?","8474","","<p>I have a 1.3L Skoda Felicia, (carburetter engine without catalytic nor other gimmicks). Since past 1-2 months I would hear the exhaust sound has changed, it became more and more audible and at full throttle it sounded like a spitting with your tongue between lips (kind of like buzzing?). Recently, in past several days it started to change and gained additional bass and overall pitch has become more like a tractor. All the sound effects kick in after 1500-1800rpm and throttle more than 20% open. If I drive smoothly the exhaust almost not audible.</p>

<p>From what I know my exhaust consists of 3 parts (Y-pipe from engine and 2 resonators connected with pipe). Y-pipe looks quite rusted, but holds ok and I doubt it would degrade in described fashion, but maybe I'm wrong.</p>

<p>Here's the question - what part of my exhaust needs changing and how could I verify/check it without garage nor extra tools?</p>
","<p>You can block one end while engine running and see if you can detect smoke coming out somewhere in the pipe/box (remember that the exhaust gets hot and if blocked for too long the engine will stop).</p>

<p>Other way is to visually inspect each element and see if they are fitted correctly, you should look for parts that can be easily disconnected.</p>

<p>Remember that some exhaust ""boxes"" have different components inside that can fail to remain attached, including some small pipes that help to reduce the noise. If that is the case you may need to replace that part of the exhaust. To cheek if that is the problem just give it a little shake (engine stopped) to see if you can hear any noise of losing parts inside.</p>

<p>Also you didn't say if the noise come from the front of the car or the back. If the noise come from the front you may check if the start of the exhaust is correctly attached to the engine and check for signs of broken/burn exhaust gaskets</p>

"Are recommended tire pressures the same for non-stock tires?","8473","","<p>This post on the TireRack blog <a href=""http://blog.tirerack.com/blog/docs-advice-on-tires/what-is-the-best-tire-pressure-for-my-new-tires"">http://blog.tirerack.com/blog/docs-advice-on-tires/what-is-the-best-tire-pressure-for-my-new-tires</a> recommends that tires be inflated to the vehicle manufacturers specifications (usually printed on a sticker on the inside of the driver's door) for best safety and performance.</p>

<p>Does this still hold true after replacing the tires with a different, non-stock tire?</p>
","<p>The manufacturer's recommended tire pressure is <strong>only</strong> for the stock or stock-equivalent tires. Depending on the non-stock tire, you could be looking at a big difference.</p>

<hr>

<p>The recommended tire pressure listed on the sticker in your car door frame is usually optimized for ride comfort and little else. According to <a href=""http://www.agcoauto.com/content/news/p2_articleid/61"">this website</a>, you will maximize fuel economy and tire life by airing up the tire to about 90% of the maximum tire pressure, as determined on the wall of the tire.</p>

<p>For example, if the maximum tire pressure is 44 psi, like it is for my car, you can safely fill it up to about 40 psi. <em>Do not</em> fill it up more than this, the 44 psi maximum is the maximum for a reason. This advice would hold for non-stock tires as well. Make sure all these measurements are done while the tires are cold by letting them sit for a while.</p>

<p>If the ride is harsh, you can reduce the psi a little at a time to something more comfortable.</p>

<hr>

<p>I <a href=""http://www.jeepforum.com/forum/f15/proper-tire-pressure-non-stock-spec-tires-224121/#post1722661"">found a neat test</a> you can perform to see if your tires are properly inflated. Draw some chalk lines on your tires perpendicular to the direction of travel. Drive a short distance <em>in a straight line</em> and look at the chalk. If the inside part of the chalk is worn more, you need to let air out of the tires. If the outside is worn more, add more air. If it is worn evenly, you are at a good pressure for that tire.</p>

"Motorcycle: Puncture in tubeless tire. OK to plug yourself?","8466","","<p>I got a nail in my tire the other day. Its wedged in the tire so tightly that the tire isnt actually losing pressure.

<p>Has anyone had any experience with this?</p>
","<p>The original tubeless tire plug consisted of a small piece of heavy twine that was impregnated with a self vulcanizing adhesive. It was inserted with a forked tool from the tread side of the tire. Over the years they have fallen out of favor and in many locations are illegal. They rope plugs have been replaced by a mushroom shaped plug. The new plug is inserted from the interior of the tire. the larger piece acts as a patch and the stem plugs the hole. The top of the plug is too large to fit thru the puncture. This greatly reduces the chance of catastophic failure that was possible with the rope plugs. In your case I would take the chance and use them for an emergency repair. Reduce your speed and ride with caution until you can have it properly repaired.</p>

"Jeep TJ death wobble troubleshooting","8462","","<p>After 4 wheeling the other day I realized I had the dreaded death wobble. I think it's worth mentioning that I am a college student, and I don't really have ideal conditions to work on my jeep, but I have most of the tools that I need.</p>

<p>So far I have replaced my stock track-bar bushing with a Poly MOOG bushing, but that did not fix the problem.</p>

<p>Today, I just got my tires aligned, since they have been pretty out of alignment for a while now. Getting the tires aligned fixed my alignment problem, but not my death wobble. Dealer said that the ""tie rod ends"" looked OK. I'm not sure what that means really, but at least that is one suspect we can eliminate. </p>

<p>What should I do next? It seems like replacing the steering stabilizer might be a good next step, but before I dish out $40 to $80 on a stabilizer, I want to make sure there isn't a cheaper solution that I should try first. </p>

<p>I realize this problem can be caused by a variety of different things, but I'm new to the area I'm living in, and there's no mechanics/dealerships I trust to troubleshoot this for me so I would really appreciate if y'all could help me get this fixed.</p>
","<p>I pulled some information from another site (<a href=""http://www.jeepz.com/forum/suspension/29510-wrangler-death-wobble-what-causes-how-fix.html"">jeepz.com</a>). It looks fairly exhaustive in what should be done to fix the dreaded death wobble. I originally thought the death wobble was only due to a bad wheel bearing, but it appears there is much more to it. I am going to pull what it says on the jeepz.com website. Here is what the site says about what exactly is ""death wobble"" or DW for short (so everyone has a clue):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Death Wobble is the shaking that happens when the front end components of your Jeep end up reacting to, or fighting each other - the end result is a violent shaking of the wheel, the Jeep itself shaking like crazy, and you eventually needing new pair of shorts. Death wobble is most commonly seen in Jeeps that have just been lifted, but can also be found in stock Jeeps.</p>
  
  <p>There are two aspects that contribute to make death wobble. First something to begins to wobble, like a tire imbalance or hitting a pothole or bump in the road. The second aspect is generally a loose or worn part that allows the minor wobble to escalate into full-blown death wobble.</p>
  
  <p>Toe-in, caster setting, and tire balance all help contribute to the beginning of a wobble. Loose/worn parts like the front track bar, steering, and control arm bushings contribute to the second phase, when the wobble is exaggerated into DW.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before you go replacing parts, here is something you should look at doing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Start with the cheapest option first, which is tightening up all the loose components on your Jeep. Here are the common torque specs for a Wrangler:</p>
  
  <p>Ft. Lbs. (max - min)</p>
  
  <p>Shock Absorber Upper Nut 23 - 17</p>
  
  <p>Shock Absorber Lower Nut 28 - 25</p>
  
  <p>Suspension Arm Lower Axle Bracket Nut 176 - 130</p>
  
  <p>Suspension Arm Lower Frame Bracket Nut 176 - 130</p>
  
  <p>Suspension Arm Upper Axle Bracket Nut 81 - 60</p>
  
  <p>Suspension Arm Upper Frame Bracket Bolt 81 - 60</p>
  
  <p>Stabilizer Bar Retainer Bolts 61 - 45</p>
  
  <p>Stabilizer Bar Link Upper Nut 61 - 45</p>
  
  <p>Stabilizer Bar Link Lower Bolt 102 - 75</p>
  
  <p>Trackbar Ball Stud Nut 81 - 60</p>
  
  <p>Track Bar Axle Bracket Bolt 47 - 40</p>
  
  <p>Hub/Bearing Bolts 102 - 75</p>
  
  <p>Hub/Bearing Axle Nut 237 - 175</p>
  
  <p>Jounce Cup Bolt 42 - 31</p>
  
  <p>CAUTION: Suspension components with rubber/urethane bushings (except stabilizer bar) should be tightened with the vehicle at normal ride height. It is important to have the springs supporting the weight of the vehicle when the fasteners are torqued. If springs are not at their normal ride position, vehicle ride comfort could be affected and premature bushing wear may occur.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What follows now are the ten reasons their site suggests can cause (or exacerbates) DW:</p>

<p><strong>DW - Cause 1 - Alignment</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Front Alignment - an out of align suspension can contribute to death wobble. If you've recently installed a lift kit then you'll need to either get an alignment or do one yourself.. If you get it aligned, make sure you go to a shop that can (and will) adjust your caster, either by caster bolts or via adjustable control arms (note that several years of Wranglers do not have caster bolts from the factory, and will need to be upgraded).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>DW - Cause 2 - Tires</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Unbalanced tires</strong> - unbalanced tires will exacerbate death wobble. Try moving your front tires to the back and see if there is a difference, if there is then pay to have them balanced. If a tire/wheel requires more than 6 ounces of total balance weights you should probably not run it on the front of your Jeep (move to the rear axle). </p>
  
  <p>The reason tire balance plays a role in death wobble is that something needs to start the wobble, and an unbalanced tire that hits a bump will normally be enough to put the front suspension in motion.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Tire damage</strong> - In addition to balancing, you should verify that your tires are round, and don't have any warping. Put front end up on jack stands. Spin both tires to check for excessive wheel/tire runout or damage.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Inflation</strong> - verify that your tires are running at the correct pressure. Over-inflation can cause problems.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>DW - Cause 3 - Caster Angle</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Caster Angle - When you install longer coil springs or spacers on your Jeep, the tire will be pushed down, away from the Jeep, but the control arms will tend to pull the axle back. The fix for this is to move the axle forward slightly, either via cam bolts or adjustable control arms. </p>
  
  <p>Cam bolts are adjustable bolts that were installed on earlier TJs that allow you to easily dial in your caster angle. If your Jeep doesn't have cam bolts, they can normally be purchased at the dealership. If you have a larger lift than cam bolts can accommodate for, you will want to look into longer upper or lower (or both) control arms. </p>
  
  <p>The larger your tires are, the less caster you'll generally need. It's been reported that Jeeps running 35 inch tires do well with 5 - 5.5* of caster, but as with everything your mileage may vary</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>DW - Cause 4 - Track Bar</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Trackbar - Check to see if your axle is out of center (if the axle sticks out farther on the driver side than the passenger). This is caused by a trackbar that is too short. Also check that your trackbar is tight, and the mount holes have not ""wobbled out"". Verify that your track bar bushings are good, and don't have any slop in them. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>DW - Cause 5 - Control Arm Bushings</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Control arm bushings</strong> - Check to make sure that your control arm bushings are not worn out. These rubber bushings will often get enlarged and allow for slop in the suspension system. Remove an upper control arm and inspect the bushing, looking for cracked and worn rubber, replace and do the same for a lower control arm. Skip this step if you are getting new control arms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>DW - Cause 6 - Control Arms</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Adjustable control arms - if the cam bolts were not enough to return the proper axle angle or your control arms are too short for your lift, you may need new adjustable control arms. This is really just an extension of number 3, caster angle. Longer control arms will push your axle farther forward than stock control arms, allowing you to increase your caster angle. An added benefit of new control arms is that you""ll get fresh new bushings as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>DW - Cause 7 - Steering Stabilizer</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A worn out stabilizer seldom causes the problem, but it does add to it. Replacing the stabilizer will help dampen any vibrations - make no mistake though, just because the stabilizer has reduced vibrations that you feel, the vibrations are still present in your suspension system, and will ultimately surface again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>DW - Cause 8 - Warped Rotors</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While it's not common, warped rotors can start your death wobble in motion. If you don't have anti-lock brakes, drive down the interstate and press the brakes in order to stop quickly, if your rotors are warped, you'll feel the pedal fluctuate. Note that anti-lock brakes will mask the pulsating feeling.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>DW - Cause 9 - Worn Tie-Rod Ends</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A worn or bent tie-rod end will allow more play in your steering system, and can cause death wobble. A good method to check for slop in your tie rod is to jack up the front of your Jeep, grasp a front tire at the 9 and 3 o'clock position and wiggle the tire. Have a friend watch the tie rod for any movement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>DW - Cause 10 - Worn Wheel Bearings</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Worn wheel bearing will contribute to Death Wobble as well. Lift your front axle up, and grasp your tire at the 12 and 6 o'clock positions and attempt to wiggle your tire. If you feel any movement then you've likely got worn wheel bearings and they should be replaced.</p>

"Oil burning: differenciate between bad valve seals or piston rings","8462","","<p>My Toyota Vitz 2007 burns engine oil. I replaced the PCV valve but it didn't help.</p>

<p>As per the answer to my previous <a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/29915/engine-burning-oil"">question</a>, this could be either due to bad piston rings or bad valve seals.</p>

<p>What can I do to differentiate between these two causes?</p>
","<p>You can perform a Leak Down Test to pinpoint what's going wrong. You'll obviously need a leakdown tester kit, you'll need an air compressor, and some hand tools.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Pull out spark plugs and either by hand or using a bar, rotate the
engine so that the first cylinder you're testing is at top dead
centre. You can put a screwdriver in the hole and watch it move up
and down as you rotate the crank. DONT turn the engine backwards if
you miss TDC.</p></li>
<li><p>Put the car into gear and set the hand brake to prevent the engine
from turning when you pump air into the cylinder. Start with the
regulator turned counterclockwise so you zero the pressure coming in.
Connect your air compressor, and turn the regulator clockwise to pressurise the cylinder.</p></li>
<li><p>Write down what the leakage percentage is on the gauge. </p></li>
<li><p>Then, open the radiator cap, the oil cap, pull the dipstick, and take off the air cleaner. You can now listen from all these points and see if you can hear air escaping. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Air whistling out of the intake probably means a leak around the intake valve.</p>

<p>Air coming out of the exhaust or exhaust mani indicates an exhaust valve leak.</p>

<p>If you hear it whistle out of the PCV valve, oil pour hole or dipstick is a sign of that air getting past the piston rings - i.e. cooked rings.</p>

<p>And if any air bubbles out through the coolant, it indicates a head gasket leak.</p>

"Why is this motorcycle burning oil, and how can I get it to stop?","8461","","<p>I have a newbie question for you.</p>

<p>I'm considering buying a 2004 Yamaha TTR600RE- a single-cylinder, air-cooled dirt-focused dual-sport bike. It's perfectly set up for adventure touring, which is what I want it for. The engine has 11k miles on it (not the original engine).</p>

<p>However, the owner has said it burns about a pint of oil every 400 miles on the freeway, which doesn't seem to bode well for any long distance trips in remote places (I'm planning a ""RTW""-type trip).</p>

<p>The owner also points out that ""The bike sometimes lets out a puff smoke from the exhaust on starting so the valve seals are worn its not a problem did a 1500 mile trip last september.""</p>

<p>Are the valve seals the likely culprit? If not, why else could this bike be burning oil? Would a mechanic, upon breaking open the engine, be able to say definitively whether the valve seals or piston ring or anything else are at fault? What would the ball-park cost for replacing the valve seals and piston ring be? (closer to $200 or $500?) How likely is it that the cause of the oil burning would not be properly diagnosed?</p>

<p>If worst comes to worst, what would a ballpark cost for an engine rebuild / new engine plus installation be?</p>

<p>Normally, I'd look for other bikes (and I am still looking), but the bike market where I live is quite small and the TTR is relatively inexpensive and seems to fit the bill in almost every other way (includes many otherwise expensive upgrades for overlanding). So if a valve seal / piston ring replacement would probably do the trick, I'd go for it. I'd appreciate your thoughts.</p>
","<p>The most likely culprit is the piston rings. One way to check before you replace them is to compression test the cylinder, then put a few drops of motor oil into the spark plug hole, and retest. If the compression goes up, it's because the oil is making a better seal on the rings.</p>

<p>Replacing the rings on a single-cylinder motorcycle is fairly easy, search online for a guide if you're interested in doing it yourself. A shop would likely charge $400 - $500.</p>

Some days it does not start or crank; seems related to the temperature.  When the car starts, it runs fine and stays that way. Often time, it will re-start throughout the day just fine until the next morning when I get to play Honda Roulette.</p>

<p><strong>Symptoms (In chronological order)</strong></p>

<p>20 months ago - My passenger airbag sensor keeps showing up on my dashboard that it's disabled. Went to the Honda dealership and they replaced the airbag. The issue went away.</p>

<p>16 months ago - I let my battery die; twice within a month.  AAA came and told me my battery was totally shot.</p>

<p>14 months ago - The passenger airbag light problem came back.</p>

<p>12 months ago - I made a long trip from VA to FL.  During the trip, there was really bad weather; Coincidentally (I assume), my dash lights flickered and my headlights were barely visible and were flickering. We had to stop a few times it got so bad; but the car always started up and would occasionally the electronics would just <em>work</em> again. The flickering issue to this degree never came back.</p>

<p>10 months ago - My car would randomly kick up to 5k RPM when I was driving at 15MPH-35MPH and just <em>stay</em> at that RPM. It would persist for 20 minutes some times and then just go away.</p>

<p>9 months ago - My car starting emitting a light shinning noise from the front that increased in pitch when my car sped up.</p>

<p>8 months ago - I figured out the whine was caused by the power steering pump, I let the fluid run a <em>little</em> low, changing that out fixed the whining issues; but I still occasionally had the RPM issues.</p>

<p>6 months ago - Once in a while, the car would have a little difficulty starting. It would always start, but not as confidently as it usually did.  Nonetheless, this caused no issues.</p>

<p>5 months ago - I finally shelled out money and got a new battery. woo. I assumed most of the issues I had been encountering were from a bad battery.</p>

<p>4 months ago - I got in the car after dropping something off at the post office and turned the key. <strong>nothing</strong>.  No sound beyond the dash lights. I turned the key again and it started without a problem.  I assumed that I just hadn't turned the key all the way.</p>

<p>2 months ago - My air conditioner was no longer cooling the car down. It was fine the day before and it just stopped working. The fans work just fine. </p>

<p>1 month ago - I went out to start my car and had the same issue that I was experiencing at the post office. Tried multiple times, no crank, no start, just the faint click of a relay.  AAA came out and first attempted to jump start with a battery and booster pack; no luck.  They jacked up my car and hit it the starter with a hammer and it miraculously started. They ran a test on my battery and alternator.  The battery was outputting 150% rated cold cranking amps (it's practically new), and the alternator was fine. There was, however, large spikes on the startup voltage V/t graph. It looked like a jagged cliff, it eventually dropped down to the normal voltage post-start but it was really rough. The AAA guy thought it might be the solenoid barely making contact.</p>

<p>20 days ago - I replaced my stater Motor/Solenoid (one module). After the installation, it started up just fine. I was happy.</p>

<p>15 days ago - Tried to start the car; and no sound ... that install wasn't exactly easy and this is really disappointing.</p>

<p>4 days ago - I went through the electronics in the car.  </p>

<ul>
<li>I checked the TRS (The shifter sensor), it correctly identifies the position and the reverse lights work correctly.</li>
<li>I checked the 3 relays in the front by the dash (Fuel Pump, Main relay, and I forget the last one).  The main relay had issues when I tested it (at least I thought), so I replaced it.  But that didn't help.</li>
<li>I plugged a diagnostics computer in. The first time I ran the diagnostics, the car wouldn't start.  No code showed up, but it did report the AC Evaporator was ""Not Ready"".</li>
<li>Then I tried starting it a few more times and it magically started again. I ran the computer test again and now it was reporting that both the AC Evaporator compressor and Catalyst were ""Not Ready"".</li>
<li><p>Try the start again, it won't start. Run the computer again, and now it reports AC Evaporator, Catalyst, and two other things I can't remember atm.</p></li>
<li><p>Try the start again, it starts just fine... Run the computer, and it still shows 4 things ""not ready"" as in the last test. No check engine light still.</p></li>
<li><p>And now my power windows don't work. But everything in the cabin is fine.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>One last note, when I turn the key, it does have a green key symbol that flashes for a second. I read online that could be the anti-theft system but I was told that if that was the case, it would let the car start and then kill it in a few seconds. Additionally, no amount of fiddling the shifter, keys, fuse unit seems to affect the start.  The only thing that seems to cause it to occasionally start is waiting till the next day or messing with the electrical system a whole bunch (but that could be coincidental). When it does not start, the only sound is the relay click and a very light whining noise coming from the front of the engine. It sounds a lot like when you don't have enough voltage in a cordless drill to the point that it can't turn anymore.</p>

<p>This is driving me mad (or not driving).  My brother believes it is a faulty ground; I think it it's either a bad (+) on the high amperage route; my Dad thinks the wiring diagrams are bad and we are missing something.</p>

<p>Any help??</p>
","<p>The fuse box turned out to be a red-herring. I had tried to start the car too many times causing the fuse box to melt.</p>

<p>The correct answer was that the ignition switch has many contacts; One of those contacts is, presumably, the starter solenoid contact.  This contact was not connecting when I turned the key.  Try to move your key in the ignition if this happens to you. I found this out when the car wouldn't start again and I bumped the key while turning it. I have done this several times now so it is the issue.</p>

<p>The seasonal temperature may cause the metal contacts in the ignition switch assembly to warp; this is one theory to why temperature may have an effect on the chance of the car starting.</p>

<p>The ultimate advantage of GDI is that through this technology everything happening inside the engine can be precisely controlled by the electronics and nothing is left to chances.
For example in mpfi some amount of fuel can be left over inside the injectors though not causing an issue , causes slight variation in every stroke but when you move over to GDI , its like a German train time table .it will be Perfect.</p>

"Outside temperature displays wrong values in Peugeot 207","8397","","<p>For some weeks now my mother-in-law's Peugeot 207 (2009 model I think) shows a wrong outside temperature. While the actual outdoor temperature has been somewhere around freezing (0°C) the temperature display showed something like -7°C to -12°C.</p>

<p>It is not static but floats by some degrees up and down over the time the car is in use. First I thought it's just off by some 10°C or so, but it seems to be more complicated: Even if the car was parked in an underground parking for some hours where the temperature is surely around 10°C or warmer, the sensor then displays some -7°C or so. So to me it looks like it's some combined offset and proportionality issue.</p>

<p>Is there something I can try out myself to narrow things down or something that I can try to fix myself (connectors that could have gone loose or stuff like that)? If yes, where would I have to search? Or is this likely to be a software issue that needs a mechanic and special equipment?</p>
","<p>By looking at some French forums it seems the outside temperature sensor is located on the bottom of the right (passenger side) mirror, and is a standard NTC thermistor.</p>

<p>The signal is analog all the way up to some computer located inside the car, and the freaky values mean either the thermistor itself is dead or its cables are damaged. It can't be a computer issue otherwise the display would just show ""--.- °C"" or most likely not work at all and show an error message.</p>

"VW Golf TDI makes a 'sneezing' sound on startup","8397","","<p>I really don't know how else to describe it. Car has no issues starting or running, but for about the last 2 months every time I cold start it, the engine makes a sharp, high-pitched noise like a sneeze. </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>Ok, I finally managed to record the noise. I realised in my attempts to record that it certainly <em>does not</em> happen ""every time"". It happens maybe one time in ten, and <em>rarely</em> on a cold start. More often than not, it happens after I've been driving for a while and then stop and start the engine.  </p>

","<p>We have a Mk4 TDI Jetta that makes a sound after startup that might be described as a sneeze. I'm fairly confident that it's the starter motor's overrun clutch.</p>

<p>As soon as the engine ""starts,"" it begins turning faster than the starter can turn. For this reason, starters have a one-way clutch, called an overrun or sprag clutch. This permits the starter to turn the engine, but prevents the engine from turning the starter, protecting the starter.</p>

<p>On my vehicle, I imagine there's some play or a worn bearing in this clutch, because as soon as the engine fires, there's a short (~1-2sec) buzzing noise that starts high in pitch and decreases in pitch quickly as the sound dies away. One might desribe this sound as ""throat clearing"" or ""sneezing"" in nature.</p>

"95 Honda civic timing marks","8380","","<p>I have a 95 Honda civic with a D16Z6 engine. I was trying to check the timing on the car, and wanted to get the engine to TDC. There were a few marks on the cam gear. There was no up pointing arrow, so I was unsure on which I should use. The linked picture shows the 3 marks at the top. One is a red dot. The other marks are at the bottom with some ticks and a dial looking thing. It lines up with a little notch at the bottom of the timing belt cover so I was thinking that may be the marker. There were also no little marks on the crankcase nut by the bottom of the car. Any help would be nice! Thanks. </p>

"Filling diesel vehicles - Vent trick","8373","","<p>According to <a href=""http://www.myturbodiesel.com/1000q/a4/vent-fuel-tank-FAQ.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">this site</a> it is possible to get more diesel fuel in your tank by pressing in the vent latch on the filler neck:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Look inside the filler neck and you can see a button, see below for detailed pics.  Press on it when the tank is almost full and you will hear the hiss of air venting.  This lets you add about 2 extra gallons of fuel.  Venting does not increase fuel economy at all, it just lets you add a little more fuel to increase miles per tank.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Heated diesel expands much less than gasoline so the likelihood of overflowing fuel is very low</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there any evidence that these claims are true and is putting more diesel fuel in in this way safe?</p>

<h2>Update:</h2>

<p>Seminecis's answer is good, but are there any similar regulations in the UK?</p>
","<p>Despite any opinions of safety it seems that gas tanks are manufactured to not accept more than 95% of their total volume because of regulations.  Here is a quote from the <a href=""http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/administration/fmcsr/fmcsrruletext.aspx?reg=393.67"">US Department of Transportation Federal Motor Carry Safety Administration Regulation 393.67 Subpart E</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(12) Overfill restriction. A liquid fuel tank manufactured on or after January 1, 1973, must be designed and constructed so that— </p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>(i) The tank cannot be filled, in a normal filling operation, with a quantity of fuel that exceeds 95 percent of the tank's liquid capacity; and</p></li>
  <li><p>(ii) When the tank is filled, normal expansion of the fuel will not cause fuel spillage.</p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Chevron's <a href=""http://www.chevronwithtechron.com/products/documents/Diesel_Fuel_Tech_Review.pdf"">Diesel Fuels Technical Review</a> - page 34 says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>THERMAL EXPANSION Like all liquids, diesel fuel expands slightly in
  volume as its temperature increases. The coefficient of thermal
  expansion measures the rate of the expansion. A typical value of the
  coefficient of thermal expansion for diesel fuel is 0.00083 per degree
  Celsius (0.00046 per degree Fahrenheit). Using this value, 1.000
  gallon of diesel fuel at
  - 7 °C (2 0°F) will expand to 1.037 gallons at 3 8°C (100°F).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>... meaning if your tank has a capacity rated at 25 gallons it is possible for it to expand up to 25.925 gallons in the described scenario.  Meanwhile, a tank designed to hold 25 gallons of fuel must be designed to be at 95% capacity maximum, which means a tank that can hold 25 gallons will actually be a 26.31579 gallon tank to allow 5% for expansion.  That means that in the above scenario there would be 0.39079 gallons of empty space left after expansion.</p>

<p>Though that scenario seems extreme, it is possible to encounter even more extreme situations even if it is unlikely.  I wouldn't take the chance of overfilling the tank since it sounds dangerous and modifications described on the <a href=""http://www.myturbodiesel.com/1000q/a4/vent-fuel-tank-FAQ.htm"">website you linked to</a> might even be illegal.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>EDIT<sup>1</sup></em></p>

<p>I couldn't find official regulation pertaining to the UK but, there is a guide at <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/vehicle-maintenance-safety-security/vehicle-maintenance"">gov.uk</a> that says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Diesel spillage is dangerous to other road users, particularly
  motorcyclists, as it will significantly reduce the level of grip
  between the tyres and road surface. Double-check for fuel leaks and
  make sure that - you do not overfill your fuel tank</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whether or not it is legal to overfill a fuel tank it is still dangerous in practice.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>EDIT<sup>2</sup></em></p>

<p>I was curious and did a little more research on the differences of thermal expansion between gasoline and diesel fuel.  I found the coefficient of thermal expansion for gasoline on <a href=""http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070608101130AA79rH6"">answers.yahoo.com</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_expansion"">wikipedia.org</a>.</p>

<pre><code>                Diesel        Gasoline
coefficient    .00083        .00095
</code></pre>

<p>Same -7 Deg. C (20 Deg. F) to 38 Deg. C (100 Deg. F) temperature increase as above.</p>

<pre><code>1 Gallon    1.03735 G        1.04275 G        Difference of 0.0054 G (~= 4 tsp.)

<p>Same 25 Gallon tank as above.</p>

<pre><code>25 Gallons    25.93375 G        26.06875 G        Difference of 0.135 G (~= 1/8 G)
% of total    3.735% Expansion    4.275% Expansion    0.54%
</code></pre>

<p>Which I take to mean that the author of the article you mentioned is technically correct that diesel expands less than gasoline but, he is very inaccurate describing diesel as expanding ""much less"" than gasoline.  Looking at the comparison objectively, I would say that the thermal expansion of diesel and gasoline fuels are comparably similar rather than noticeably different.  In fact, I would interpret the numbers as: ""they both expanded one gallon in the 25 gallon tank.""</p>

<p>I guess I'm trying to say that I don't fully trust the author of that article.</p>

"Can cold weather cause TPMS sensors to malfunction?","8367","","<p>I just bought a new 2011 Honda Fit and while driving it home from the dealer, I noticed that a little light on the dashboard was on that said ""TPMS"".  When I got home, I consulted the owner's manual and learned that this acronym stands for ""Tire Pressure Monitoring System"", and that the light being on indicates that there is a problem with the system.  (There is a different indicator that comes on if the pressure in a particular tire is low.)</p>

<p>The actual tire pressure was fine and there was nothing visibly wrong with the tires, so I called the dealer to ask about the indicator light and was told that it is fairly common for the TPMS sensors to malfunction in cold weather, in which case they just need to be reset by the dealer.  I'm scheduled to take the car back to the dealer this week anyway to have some options installed, but since this is a brand new car that I'm most likely planning to keep for a very long time, I'm curious whether this really is a common and trivial issue or if it's something I should be concerned about and push to have fixed.  I live in Colorado and while it was indeed chilly that day (I believe it was around 25-35F), it is certainly not unusual for it to be that cold or colder here many days per year.</p>
","<p>I don't know if it's common for them to malfunction, but assuming there are no leaks in your tire the pressure at 25F is about 10% lower than at 70F which is probably enough to trip the sensor.</p>

<p>I have a BMW with TPMS and any time the temperatures drop quickly the light comes on my dash.  If the temperature drop is temporary and things warm back up later in the week the light will often go off on its own.  If that's not the case I usually top off the tires with air and that also resolves the issue.</p>

","<p>So-called ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octane_number"">octane number</a>"" is a measure of how much the air-fuel mix is resistant to detonation.</p>

<p>The higher the ""octane number"" is the more resistant it is and the more is can be compressed without exploding. The higher the pressure is at the point the air-fuel mix ignites the more efficient the engine works.</p>

<p>Modern engines are designed for some rather high air-fuel mix pressure, if the mix ignites before that pressure is reached the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine_knocking"">engine just won't work right</a>, because ignition will happen at the wrong moment of the engine cycle.

<p>Which method is the best, i.e. doesn't damage the chrome, and gives a long-lasting effect?</p>
","<p>For rust removal... my personal favorite technique involves a lot of distilled white vinegar and a green ""scrunge"" (like a 3M scrubbing pad) or a pad of steel wool. By ""a lot"" of vinegar, I mean never allow the surface to get dry - always keep it wet with vinegar or it'll ""flash rust"" while you work. This generally involves working only a fairly small area (one or two square feet) at a time.</p>

<p>When you're totally finished with an area, wipe it totally dry, beginning with paper towels and ending with toilet tissue - get <strong>all</strong> the rust-vinegar slurry off the surface; your last wipe should come up with a completely clean wad of toilet tissue.</p>

<p>That method also works very well for such things as cast-iron table saw tops. It's how I get rid of the rust on my table saws in Vermont, where rust grows faster than weeds.</p>

<p>Bronze wool works as well as - and possibly better than - steel wool. Some steel wool is much harder (has a higher carbon content than) other steel wool, and may possibly scratch chrome. Bronze wool, like ""scrunges"", isn't hard enough to scratch the chrome.</p>

<p>It is the rear bumper support and can be found under the bumper cover. As far as how imperative it is to fix, it all depends on the amount of damage which was done. You really need to take the bumper cover off to get a good look at the damage to this piece.</p>

<p>You could probably get away with not replacing this right now, but need to realize what ever damage has been done to it, if another person were to rear-end you, the protection of the piece will be much reduced. It all depends on the damage which was done to it. </p>

<p>This piece does not appear to have hydraulic absorbers associated with it, so it took the brunt of the 10mph hit. While 10mph does not seem like a lot, bumpers are only required to take a 5mph hit without damage to the vehicle. You can almost be assured the 10mph hit has done <em>some</em> kind of damage. A second hit at 10mph could damage a lot more than this piece if this piece were to fail. </p>

"Normal to leave nail in tire after a flat?","8181","","<p>So today was that epic event of walking out into the parking lot at high noon, sun blazing, and finding out you have a completely flat tire.  Skipping over the usual details about changing out a tire with insufficient equipment on scorching hot pavement, I changed out the tire for the spare and dropped the flat tire off at a tire shop for repair.</p>

<p>When I got my vehicle home and was putting away the spare, I noticed that the nail was still in the tire itself.  The nail appeared to be a roofing nail based upon the size of the head.  There also appeared to be some sort of sealant surrounding the nail.</p>

<p>My question is if it's normal to leave the nail in the tire or not.  With previous leaks, other repair shops have removed the nail or screw.  I haven't been to this tire shop before so I don't know if what they did was standard practice or not.</p>
","<p><strong>Nope, not normal</strong></p>

<p>You do not leave a foreign object in a tire under any circumstances.  The object can dislodge itself during higher speeds and lead to deflation creating a very high risk event.</p>

<p>If they plugged the tire there will be a rubber plug with vulcanizing glue but not a nail or other related object.</p>

<p>Validate that it's not a rubber plug, if it's not, go back to the shop.  This is not normal in my experience and IMO very dangerous.</p>

"Do cowl hoods actually help with engine cooling?","8167","","<p>I've read that cowl hoods used to be the method for air induction for older vehicles with carburetors and that the only purpose they serve for vehicles with fuel injection is for looks.</p>

<p>However, I hear quite a few people (especially Cherokee owners) say they help keep the engine cool, too.  Is this true or does a cowl hood make any significant difference in engine temp?</p>
","<p>While I won't say a cowl was <em>never</em> used for cooling the engine bay (I'm sure <em>someone</em> has done that), it really won't do much for cooling (as in to draw air out from and engine bay) and here's why:</p>

<p>As your vehicle is travelling down the road the air travelling around different parts of the vehicle creates high pressure areas. The two biggest of these are the front end (grill area) and the windshield. The base of the windshield especially, because this is where the air starts to make its turn upward to go over the top of the car. Because of this, there is basically <em>no way</em> for there to be any heat extraction from this area. You <em>can</em>, however, draw air into the engine from there. This high pressure area not only provides a source of denser air, it also provides <em>cooler</em> air, all of which helps produce horsepower. This was GM's theory behind the Chevelle Cowl Induction hood.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SQHal.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SQHal.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>There are three main purposes for a cowl hood:</p>

<ul>
<li>Aesthetics</li>
<li>Provide clearance for under hood engine parts</li>
<li>To locate a source of cold air for the intake at the base of the hood</li>
</ul>

<p>If a manufacturer has wanted cooling effects from the hood area, they will usually use an extractor to do this. Heat extractors work by using the venturi principle, where the air is sped up over a lip and when it gets over the lip, it slows down and creates an slight vacuum at the port, which pulls air out from under the hood. </p>

"What does under-square and over-square mean?","8122","","<p>When building an engine, the terms <em>over-square</em> and <em>under-square</em> come up.</p>

<p><strong>What do these terms mean?</strong> </p>

<p>How do they apply to engine building? </p>

<p>Which is better for what purpose? </p>

<p>Can you give examples of each and their usage?</p>
","<p><strong>You Asked</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What do these terms mean?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These terms are related to the bore and stroke measurements of a pistons travel inside a bore of an internal combustion engine.  Bore is the diameter of the cylinder.  Stroke is the distance a piston travels within a bore.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What does under-square and over-square mean?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Under-square refers to a piston diameter measurement that is larger than the stroke length measurement.  Over-square refers to the opposite.  A stroke length measurement that is larger than a piston diameter measurement.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How do they apply to engine building?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They are essential components to accomplishing a particular goal in engine building.  A larger bore allows a larger piston.  A larger piston allows for a larger combustion chamber.  A larger combustion chamber allows for larger valves which will effect the quantity of gasses that can potentially flow through the ICE.</p>

<p>In pushrod engines a longer bore can create more valve reciprocating weight due to the longer pushrods.</p>

<p>In DOHC engines a shorter stroke and a larger piston can allow for a higher RPM and more efficiency at higher RPM's due to less reciprocating weight related to the connecting rods, pistons and crankshaft.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Which is better for what purpose?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Typically, a long stroke will result in an engine with higher torque at lower RPM due to the higher reciprocating mass.</p>

<p>A short stroke can result in greater engine performance <strong>if</strong> the engine is designed for high RPM running.  Engines typically become more efficient at higher RPM's, to a point.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can you give examples of each and their usage?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In motorcycles the Ducati Desmosedici powerplant has an over-square configuration.  A short stroke with a very large piston.  This is a high RPM 989cc engine.  The Harley Davidson Twin Cam 98B powerplant is 1.8 liters is an under-square configuration with a very long stroke V-Twin.</p>

"How important is it to clay before polishing and waxing?","8114","","<p>I've seen a number of mentions of ""claying"" before polishing, with <a href=""https://youtu.be/PyJYtYhz9RQ?t=14m39s"">some people</a> swearing that it's an absolutely necessary step before polishing, <a href=""https://youtu.be/2_iDnIPpQuw?t=10s"">while others</a> seem to get good ( or at least pretty decent ) results without this step.</p>

<p>But for a normal car, with not perfect, but decent paint ( some nicks, some oxidation, but hasn't lost it's clear coat yet ) how recommended is this step.</p>

<p>I'm not talking about taking the car to a show, just wanting it to look what you might call ""normally"" good without it taking 10 hours to complete.</p>

<p>And of course, exactly what is ""clay"" and specifically, from a technical point of view, why and when is it recommended?</p>
","<p><strong>tl dr:</strong> It isn't necessary, but it improves the quality of the polish/wax job.</p>

<p>""Claying"" (otherwise known as using a clay bar or detailing clay), is a means by which to remove contaminants from the finish of your vehicle which washing alone will not remove. The clay bar creates a shearing action, which basically cuts the contaminants off of the clear coat, then encapsulates the contaminant so as to not create damage to the finish. When done, the finish is more ready to receive polish and/or wax.</p>

<p>The clay bar itself is pretty much what the name implies, though it's not made out of organic or natural stuff, but more-so is a synthetic (man made) clay specifically designed to do what it's designed to do: remove paint contaminants. A typical bar of clay comes wrapped up like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3cIT0.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3cIT0.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>They can come in just about any color. When you first pull the clay out of the wrapper, you need to knead it, as in, fold it back on itself and get it more malleable. When actually using it, you need to also use a lubricant with it to ensure it isn't sticking to (or grabbing) the clear coat in the process. Here is an image of what it kind of looks like when in action:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bo6dZ.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bo6dZ.jpg"" alt=""diagram of paint, clay and contaminants""></a></p>

<p>The contaminants are stuck to the clear coat, while the clay bar comes along and intercepts them, absorbing them into itself. To do this correctly, you need to continually fold the clay bar back on itself to further encapsulate the contaminants inside the clay bar. When in use, the clay bar will look like this, and is how you'll know it's working:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/niNQO.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/niNQO.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>You work a small part of the car at a time, ensuring you are keeping the clay bar wet and the lubricant present at all times. If you should <strong><em>EVER</em></strong> drop your clay bar to the ground, get a new one, as the contaminants from the ground can cause big damage to the finish on your vehicle.</p>

<p>You should wash your car prior to using a clay bar so as the clay bar is only picking up contaminants from what is stuck to the finish and not everything which is on the vehicle prior to. It should be a noticeable difference after using a clay bar, especially after waxing/polishing. As was stated, it isn't necessary, but it does make the finished product look that much better.</p>

<p>PS: You can clay bar your windows as well to improve optical clarity.</p>

<ol>
<li>Indicator Stalk - The switch contacts in the control stalk could be at fault (thanks @alex).</li>
<li>Hazard Light Switch - It may seem counter-intuitive that if the hazard lights work then the hazard switch is at fault, however the wiring from the indicator control stalk goers through the hazard control switch as the hazard switch effectively acts as the control stalk but applies power to both indicator light circuits at the same time. Due to the fact that the hazard light switch does not get frequently used the wires can come loose from the back of the switch or the switch can get a fault so if the fuse and the stalk seem in good nick then check the hazard switch.</li>

","<p>I had a similar problem removing the exhaust manifold on my Civic.  If you're confident you can find replacements for whatever you're going to tear up, just get a Dremel and use it.

Go with the smallest model because it's cheap (well under $50) but still works fine and can get in small places larger tools can't.

"What are the advantages of upside down forks?","8031","","<p>Recently, I have come across many bikes which have upside down front forks.</p>

<p>From browsing around the internet, I was not able to get a concrete answer for why it is preferred over conventional telescopic forks.</p>
","<p><strong>There are several advantages to upside down forks</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Rigidity</p></li>
<li><p>Caliper Mounting</p></li>
<li><p>Stability</p></li>
<li><p>Reduced Unsprung Weight</p></li>
<li><p>Reduced Sprung Weight</p></li>
<li><p>Reduced Stanchion Friction Levels</p></li>
<li><p>Increased Stanchion to Slider Overlap</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Image of the lower portion of a pair of inverted forks</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5n9II.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5n9II.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The largest delta between the legacy standard fork and an inverted fork is in their strength. Bending occurs just below the bottom of the yoke. When brakes are applied you are slowing the front wheel.  This reduced forward motion </p>

<p>All the momentum of the bike acts through the forks, trying to push the front wheel along.  The reduced inertia is felt at the yolk and the upper slider mounted within it.  The larger diameter slider allows for increased rigidity thereby transferring more energy directly to the frame rather than bending the slider.</p>

<p>The slider is made of lightweight material and it's increased diameter from standard forks does not increase weight significantly.  The stanchion which inserts into the slider is significantly shorter and has thinner walls.  This component is typically made of ferrous material and is significantly heavier than the slider.  Due the construction of the stanchion in an inverted fork, reduced length, this component in an inverted configuration offers great gains in weight and effects the unsprung weight of the front end.  Reduced unsprung weight results in performance gains regarding the wheels contact with the pavement making for a greater 'feel' for the rider.</p>

<p>The increased stanchion diameter has an effect on the bushings in the slider which are spaced further apart vertically and have a significant gain in surface area contact with the stanchion.  This allows for greater hydrodynamic lubrication and reduced friction. </p>

<p>Caliper mounting points are also effected and now allow for radial or monoblock style brakes.  The mounting point at the bottom of the fork and the reduced stanchion length create less leverage, the larger bushings and increased surface are in conjunction allow for harder braking into corners.  The legacy standard design had a tendancy of locking the slider and the stanchion together under heavy braking when the stanchion broke through hydrodynamic lubrication and made metal to metal contact with the bushing.  This front end lockup under hard braking in a corner could have catastrophic consequences as the normally absorbed energy through uneven roadway contact was transferred directly to the contact patch of the tire.</p>

<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p>

<p>USD's have a bit more complexity than standard forks, especially the nitrogen charged versions.  Additional components and bladders for nitrogen retention require professional maintenance with special tools.</p>

<p>Seal failure in USD's require a higher level of urgency for maintenance as the oil within the fork is retained above the seal in this design.  Under those circumstances fork oil will be discharged upon the brake disc, brake caliper, wheel and tire.  Due to the retention mechanism for the seal it is rare that a catastrophic seal failure will occur where oil is sprayed upon these components but it has been known to happen under rare circumstances, typically due to the human error in re-assembly of the system.</p>

<p>Additionally, due to added complexity of components, cost of USD's over standard forks are significant.  This also applies to the plethora of tools required to rebuild USD's.</p>

<p><strong>Maintenance</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Wet and dry seal replacement</p></li>
<li><p>Nitrogen recharge</p></li>
<li><p>Bushing replacement</p></li>
<li><p>R&amp;R oil</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Maintenance tasks are basically the same as standard forks as the list above denotes.  Special tools are required for driving seals, oil level height measurement, fork cap installation and nitrogen charging (if they are nitrogen charged).</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Inverted forks decrease internal friction of components and ""add lightness"".  Increased rigidity creates stability and brake mount points increase safety while braking in turns.</p>

<p>Why can't we pass it as hot air, since inside the engine the air will be compressed which will heat it up anyway?</p>
","<h2>tl;dr</h2>

<ul>
<li><em>To combat detonation (in SI engines)</em></li>
<li><em>To increase power/efficiency</em></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>There are a few important factors at play here.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Engine detonation is a real concern for SI engines</em></strong></p>

<p>A spark-ignition engine is more likely to experience premature ignition (aka knocking or detonation) with hotter air. In fact, the calculations in the example below can show that this is the primary reason why intercooling is such a Good Idea.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Hot air rises, cold air sinks</em></strong></p>

<p>In physics-speak, hot air is less dense than cold air. This means that the volume occupied by 1 kg of hot air is greater than the volume occupied by 1 kg of cold air.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>The internal combustion engine is a volumetric device</em></strong></p>

<p>What this implies is that every time the engine turns over and completes a cycle, the volume of air that is admitted into the combustion chamber(s) is fixed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Power depends on mass, not volume</em></strong></p>

<p>The power developed by the engine is proportional to the mass of air admitted into the combustion chamber and not its volume. More air molecules = more bang.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>The reason why turbochargers (or any other forced-induction devices) are utilized is to increase the power and/or efficiency of the IC engine. At combustion chamber level, this is achieved by increasing the amount of air molecules present during combustion.</p>

<p>The turbocharger achieves this by pressurizing the incoming air. An unwanted by-product of this compression process is that the outgoing air is hot and less dense.</p>

<p>If this hot air is fed to the combustion chamber as-is, the likelihood of engine detonation is greater.</p>

<p>By cooling the air via an intercooler, engine operation being safer since engine knock is reduced.</p>

<p>As an added bonus the air becomes slightly denser, enabling more air molecules to be present during combustion.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Bonus Example</h2>

<p><em>This is one of those questions where numbers can speak louder than words</em>:</p>

<p>Forums indicate that a stock Mitsubishi Evo X is capable of generating 22 psi boost at mid-range RPM.</p>

<p>At sea level, the turbo inlet conditions are as follows:</p>

<pre><code>Air pressure @ turbo inlet      = 14.7 psi

Assumed inlet air temperature   = 25 °C
  =&gt; air density @ turbo inlet  = 1.184 kg/m^3
</code></pre>

<p>Assuming 85% turbocharger efficiency, engineering calculations<a href=""http://www.peacesoftware.de/einigewerte/luft_e.html""><sup>1</sup></a> will yield a discharge temperature close to 92 °C:</p>

<pre><code>Air pressure @ turbo outlet     = 14.7 + 22
                                = 36.7 psi 
Air density @ 36.7 psi, 92 °C   = 2.41 kg/m^3
</code></pre>

<p>Were it not for the fact that we care about detonation, the outlet density value looks rather tasty - it is more than double that of the inlet.</p>

<p>But look what happens when we run this hot discharge air through an intercooler.</p>

<p>Let's assume a 1 psi drop in pressure, and that the air is cooled down to 70 °C:</p>

<pre><code>Air density @ 35.7 psi, 70 °C = 2.50 kg/m^3
</code></pre>

<p>Despite the fact that we lose precious boost through the intercooler, the cooling effect ends up increasing the density by over 3%, so now the air is denser, and, more importantly, safer from an engine knock/detonation standpoint.</p>

"Why don't all diesel engines have throttle plates?","7976","","<p>I learned recently that many older and some newer diesels don't have throttle plates to control airflow.  I was also quite shocked to learn about a condition called <a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/23585/diesel-engine-runaway-what-is-it"">diesel engine runaway.</a>  Apparently a diesel engine can run out of control from oil pooling in the manifold.</p>

<p>It seems that not having throttle plates on older diesel engines has it's risks.  Why have newer diesel engines begun to adopt a throttle?  What are the ultimate benefits of incorporating a throttle plate into the intake system?  </p>

<p>I can see benefits regarding preventing diesel runaway conditions.  Risk for diesel runaway can be mitigated with intake design to prevent the oil pooling condition in the intake manifold, so why integrate a throttle plate?  Would a throttle plate assist in greater level of efficiency for fuel consumption? </p>
","<p><strong>tl dr:</strong> By adding a throttle plate, it creates the vacuum needed to draw in gasses from an EGR valve. </p>

<p>Since diesel engines are designed to run lean, they don't need throttle plates to run. They utilize the amount of diesel fuel needed to keep the engine running and to provide the work needed to do the job required of them. One of the inherent issues with running lean is with a lean burn, you also run hotter. If the burn is hotter than ~1700 degF, you start to form Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), which is the key ingredient in acid rain and will tear up people's lungs (therefor is nasty stuff). </p>

<p>One of the ways to deter the formation of NOx during the combustion cycle is to introduce an Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) process. The spent exhaust gasses provide a means by which to control the burn process thus reducing the heat in during the combustion process. This has been used for many years in gasoline engines. Unfortunately with diesel engines, since there isn't a high level of vacuum in the intake, it won't readily draw the EGR gasses into itself and therefore is self defeating. By adding a throttle plate, it creates the vacuum needed to do the draw. </p>

"Grease on wheel bolts or not?","7965","","<p>My father (an engineer, but not an auto mechanic) taught me to use a tiny dab of machine grease on the thread (not the rim) of each wheel bolt. This would help against corrosion, and help when loosening the bolt. We've traditionally always switched summer/winter wheels ourselves, on the premise of time and money saved for a simple operation. (Yes, we do use a torque wrench and check the bolts after 100km.)</p>

<p>Online and offline, there seems to be a great deal of argument <strong>whether or not to lubricate wheel bolt threads...</strong> has this site been able to find a canonical answer? I searched through the tagged questions but didn't find it even mentioned.</p>

<p>If I want to make an informed decision myself, what sorts of pro or contra arguments should I consider?</p>
","<p>Do exactly what the manufacturer of the vehicle states in service information. Why do I say this?  The nut rotational friction and bolt clamping force are both affected by the choice of lubricant used or lack thereof. Almost all OEM's specify no lube. This is done for several reasons. Dry results in the most thread rotational friction, a most desirable attribute, this significantly reduces the chances of the lugs backing off and the wheel coming off.  </p>

<p>The biggest concern is a wheel coming off at high speed. This is a highly dangerous event because the wheel accelerates ahead of the vehicle as it comes off at great speed and can and has caused deaths. </p>

<p>Of slightly less importance, but still relevant, is that lubricated threads create a higher clamping force for a given torque than specified. This can stretch the studs or bolts, warp the hub flange and/or brake rotor. </p>

<p>I am an Mechanical Engineer and work in the vehicle repair industry. This topic has been a topic of some debate on professional industry forums. Much to the concern of the informed on said forums is that a significant portion of professional technicians refuse to heed the OEM specifications for both lubricants and torque specifications. </p>

"What are all the different types of fluid in a car and a short summary of their use?","7913","","<p>A fluid is defined as anything that flows, hence for our purposes a gas or a liquid. I know that there is fuel, engine oil, engine coolant and brake fluid. Also air is normally taken in through a grill on the front of the car.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>Are there any other important fluids in a car?</em></strong></li>
<li><em>Are there any other uses for the ones that I have already mentioned?</em></li>
<li><em>How are these fluids able to be transported from one part of the car to another?</em></li>
<li><em>Do the liquids have pumps (I know some do)?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>For example, is there another oil circuit in order to keep the gearbox functional? Or how does the fuel get from the back of the car to the front (in most cases)?</p>

<p>Please give a brief summary of <strong><em>all</em></strong> of them if you can. There can't be that many!</p>
","<p>There are quite a lot of different fluids inside a modern car. I tried to group them by purpose.</p>

<h2>Hydraulic Fluids</h2>

<p><strong>General use</strong>: Hydraulic fluids are used to <strong>transfer power</strong> from one point to another</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Brake Fluid</strong> - Based on glycole-ether, mineral oil or silicone oil. Brake fluids are designed to have high boiling points because the brake system is subject to a lot of heat and hydraulic systems need incompressible fluids to work. If the break fluid starts boiling, it turns into gas - which is compressible. In this case the force from the brake pedal is used to compress the gas instead of moving the brake pads, resulting in a brake failure. Brake fluid is transported by the brake cylinder which is driven by your foot and supported by engine vacuum if your engine is running and equipped with a vacuum servo / brake booster.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Power Steering Fluid</strong> - In most cases based on mineral oil. Often ATF (see below) is used as hydraulic fluid inside the power steering. Transported by a mechanical pump driven by the crankshaft using a v-belt.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Clutch Fluid</strong> -  In some cases the clutch fluid and brake fluid are in the same circuit. That means they share the same reservoir and have separate hydraulic cylinders. Even if they don't have the same reservoir, in most cases the clutch fluid itself is just brake fluid. It is transported by mechanic pressure from your leg.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Lubricants</h2>

<p><strong>General use</strong>: Lubricants are used to <strong>minimize friction</strong> between moving parts. This leads to (significantly) longer lasting components. </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Engine Oil</strong> - transported by a mechanical pump inside the engine (driven by crankshaft)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gear Oil</strong> / Automatic Transmission Fluid (<strong>ATF</strong>) - I dont't know for sure - but I think its transported inside the gearbox by the gears themselves. If the transmission is equipped with an transmission oil cooler it could be transported with some kind of pump.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Differential Oil</strong> - transported inside the differential by the differential gears - if the car is equipped with a differential oil cooler it's moved by an electric pump.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Most lubricants serve a double purpose as <strong>coolant fluids</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Coolant Fluids</h2>

<p><strong>General use</strong>: Coolant fluids are used to <strong>transport heat</strong> away from components where heat is generated towards a radiator where air transports the heat away from the car.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Engine Coolant</strong> - Consists of water, anti-freeze additives and anti-corrosive additives, transported by a mechanical pump inside the engine (driven by crankshaft)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>AC Coolant</strong> - Transported by a mechanical pump driven by the crankshaft using a v-belt.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Air</strong> - Transported to the radiators or cooling fins by dynamic pressure if the car is moving of by fans if the car is not. The fans are driven by the crankshaft or by electricity.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Fuels</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Diesel</strong> - Transported depending on engine type by an injection pump driven by the crankshaft or camshaft. This can be a unit injector or a high pressure plunger pump (common rail direct fuel injection).  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gasoline</strong> - Transported by an electric pump mostly located inside the fuel tank.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Autogas</strong> / Liquefied Petroleum Gas (<strong>LPG</strong>) - Transported by an electric pump located inside the tank</p></li>
<li><p><strong>CNG</strong> Compressed Natural Gas - Needs no pump as it is stored under high pressure.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Washing fluids</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Windshield washer fluid</strong> - transported by an electric pump.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Other fluids</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Intake Air</strong> - Transported inside the engine by suction (naturally aspirated engine) or by a turbine (turbocharched or supercharged engines)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Exhaust Gas</strong> - Transported out of the engine by the engine itself</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Nitrous oxide (N2O)</strong> - Used to increase engine power. N2O is capable of delivering more oxygen into the engine than air allone could. More Oxygen can be used to burn more fuel which results in higher engine power output. N2O needs no pump as it is stored in pressurized bottles.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Water</strong> and/or <strong>Methanol</strong> for water injection or methanol-water injection. These fluids are sprayed into the intake air to cool it down, and therefore reduce knocking and increase engine power. This system is also called anti-detonant injection (<strong>ADI</strong>) or <strong>MW50</strong>.</p></li>

"Engine hot, radiator cold","7907","","<p>I own an Audi A3 2001 8L1. When engine gets to operating temperature it sometimes starts to overheat. I touched the radiator after driving the car for some time and it was completely cold to the touch but the engine was at operating temperature.</p>

<p>I've changed the thermostat a few months ago and now I'm thinking that I either installed a broken one or installed it the wrong way, but from looking at images online I doubt that is the case.</p>

<p>I'v also noticed that some people say it could be the heater core clogged up but this is not the case here as it is blowing hot air when set to maximum.</p>

<p>I've only recently noticed this as the past few months very cold so I never had an overheating issue.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>
","<p>Quick answer for engine overheating/cold radiator would be:</p>

<p>a) Check there is coolant in the system: refill as needed and check for leaks. Remember to purge air bubbles: my way is that as I add coolant I squeeze the hoses attached to the engine, like a hand rubber pump, then start the engine without radiator cap, for some seconds, then redo.</p>

<p>b) Check thermostat: an easy way is to remove the thermostat completely and run the engine without it for a test. A way to check the thermostat is to heat water and immerse the thermostat hanged with some wires, if water is hot enough (varies for thermostats but would be between 80C to 90C) the thermostat should ""click"", i.e., open. <strong><em>NOTE: some engine designs requires the thermostat to be placed in its correct position, otherwise coolant won't flow as designed/needed.</em></strong></p>

<p>c) Check water pump: be sure engine has coolant, start engine and slowly release the ""out"" hose from the engine, commonly at the engine's head. Or slowly release the hose to the radiator. You should see water coming out with some pressure. Otherwise, remove water pump and check if it is sound.</p>

<p>d) Check water coming out from engine: the engine block/engine head could be severely stuck. Add coolant, start engine, release ""out"" hose. Coolant should flow out with pressure.</p>

<p>e) Check ""in"" and ""out"" hoses in radiator: release one first, check, then the other. Coolant should flow freely, otherwise radiator could be clogged.</p>

<p>Resuming what to blame:</p>

<p>No coolant, bad thermostat, bad water pump, clogged engine block/engine head (it was my latest ordeal...totally blocked with soil), clogged radiator (was my previous ordeal, when acquired this car...tons of gasketmaker silicon gunk).</p>

<p>REMEMBER:</p>

<p>When starting the engine for the procedures I said above, <strong>always do with cold engine!</strong> Don't scald yourself. Starting the engine for a few seconds, cold, to check this stuff won't be enough time to heat it that much, and if it does, just let is cool down.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>The correct way to install the thermostat into its flange:</p>

","<h2>Gloves are not essential, but highly recommended</h2>

<p>When replacing a car battery there are three potential hazards that relate to safety:</p>

"Engine Coolant Temperature sensor goes bad whenever the outside temperature is hot","7839","","<p>This is on a 1998 Chevy Cavalier, automatic transaxle, 2.2L.  This sensor went bad last July and I replaced it then.  When it goes bad, the check engine light comes on and then the temperature gauge on the dashboard doesn't report the temperature (it stays at the bottom/cold).</p>

<p>It went bad again last week, after which I replaced it.  Drove around a bit and seemed to be running/reporting correctly, but then after about 10 minutes, the temp gauge dropped back to cold and I am back to square one.</p>

<p>When the ECT sensor quits working, the transmission starts shifting hard (I just checked the transmission fluid; Ended up adding about 2 quarts, but it is still shifting hard).  During the ~10 minutes that the sensor was working, the transmission seemed to be shifting properly.</p>

<p>Has anyone seen this type of problem before? Any ideas why the sensor would go bad whenever the outside temp is hot, or comments on the apparent link between the hard shifting and the bad gauge?</p>
","<p>Wiring problem?  Unplug the connector and check the pins with a multimeter.  If it looks alive, trace the wiring from the connector as far as you can.  If you're lucky you'll be able to visually see a problem, it not, you'll have to probe the wires until you find the fault.  If it's actually dead at the sensor, are you sure you've got the correct part?  </p>

<p>Some vehicles have two sensors, one going to the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powertrain_control_module"" rel=""nofollow"">powertrain controller</a> and the other going to the cluster.  It sounds like you've only got one.  I'd guess the PCM is feeding the gauge cluster.  When the sensor is 'dead', the PCM should command any cooling fans you have on to full power.  When the sensor seems to be working, if you pull the wiring connector, do the fans come on immediately?</p>

<p>As far as the correlation with hard shifting, I'm not sure what's going on there.  Do you have a transmission cooler?  If so, maybe the PCM is altering the shifts since it doesn't know how hot the cooling system is.  If not, maybe you've got a ground problem in your wiring harness and the coolant sensor is sharing it with something in your transmission?  Timo's got the right idea, check the continuity on the pin for the ground wire on the connector for the sensor when the gauge is dead vs when it's working.  It's probably a two wire setup, if so, the black wire should be ground.</p>

"Engine revs up when braking","7836","","<p>Background: 2012 Honda Civic EX, 5-speed automatic, with no mods except a non-stock tire (ran over a large bolt). I keep it maintained per the manufacturer's manual and always see the Honda dealership that sold it to me new for maintenance. 20k miles.</p>

<p>Sometimes when I am going down an incline at about 65 mph and I need to brake a moderate amount (decelerating about 3 - 4 mph per second), my engine will rev up significantly. For example, if my cruising RPM at 65 mph is about 2100 RPM, it'll kick up to 2500 - 2800 RPM when braking, and only back down to about 1500 RPM once I either step on the gas again, or reach a very low speed (under 20 mph).</p>

<p>What is going on? Is the car shifting into a very low gear in anticipation of stopping very fast? I usually brake just enough to keep from running into the car ahead of me, and although the brake pedal isn't nearly fully depressed (like I said a ""moderate"" braking), I rarely have to bring the car to a full stop when I'm in this situation.</p>

<p>It seems fuel-inefficient to run the engine at 2500 - 3000 RPM for a good 15 or 20 seconds when I'm actually asking the car to decelerate. In other automatic cars I've owned (much older; 1997 and 2002), the engine's RPMs just gradually decline the slower you go. Neither my Civic nor my older cars use a continuously variable transmission. I am unaccustomed to this behavior and am looking to see if it is abnormal or something that this car just does because that's the way it's designed.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href=""http://www.civicforums.com/forums/210-engine/350659-2012-honda-civic-ex-engine-braking-econ-button.html"">Here</a> some other people appear to be having the same problem.</p>

<p>For the record, I <em>always</em> drive with the ""Econ"" button <strong>ON</strong> and am applying steady brake pressure, not ""pumping"". It may be ""Grade Logic"" as one of the posters on that forum put it.</p>
","<p>Although automated manuals are becoming more popular, the 2012 Civic (from my 2 seconds of searching) appears to be a normal automatic.</p>

<p>Even still, I'm guessing your vehicle may have the sensors and programming necessary to determine that it's descending an incline and is employing engine braking to help you slow down. What it sounds like it's doing is putting the car in gear to allow the drivetrain and engine to add some drag to the car's momentum.</p>

<p>My 2012 Focus does this--but it has an automated manual. Which is an awkward term for a manual's clutch and gearshift that is computer controlled.</p>

<p>I guess a good question would be: Does the car feel like it takes more or less braking when this occurs? If it takes less, the car is helping you slow down. If more, it might be a malfunction.</p>

<p>Another question: If you were to let off the brake when it revs up, do the revs go down again? Try not to fly off cliffs or anything if you try that.</p>

<p>If the engine is braking, this is not going to use any fuel, with exceptions for say, when the car isn't warmed up, and any other rules that it may have.</p>

"My car's steering wheel rotates to right when I lift my hands off","7819","","<p>I have Mercedes E350 2009. When I hold steering wheel straight, car drives straight. When I lift my hands off,  car and steering wheel tend to turn right. What could be the reason here? </p>
","<p>There are several things that can cause this - the simplest being the road itself! If you are on a cambered road, the car will want to pull towards the edge of the road...</p>

<p>Presuming it's a stronger pull than that, your next suspect is the tracking (wheel alignment) - if this is out it will cause it to pull. Most decent tyre fitters will be able to check this for you, and adjust it for a fee. It's worth doing this every so often anyway, e.g. each time you fit new tyres.</p>

<p>If that doesn't fix it, check your brakes - if one is rubbing, it will slow the car on that side, and so cause it to pull across. After a drive, bring the back of your hand towards the centre of each wheel - make sure the right hand one isn't hotter than the left. </p>

<p>You can also have problems with electric power steering, but I don't think Mercedes use that...</p>

The person who posted that weighed their float down with 12 gauge copper wire, apparently the new fuel pump had the same problem with the float as the one that needed replacing.</p>

<p>My question is: Is that a safe way to weigh down the float? copper wire conducts electricity and a conductor in my gas tank worries me a little bit. Also, what is the recommended way to fix a floating gas needle, if that person took the wrong approach?</p>
","<p>I think weighing down the float is definitely the wrong approach - they're fixing the symptom (float not falling) rather than the cause (stiff pivot on the sender). It looks like the sender is easy to remove from the pump, so I'd try and make sure the sender moved freely through its full range of movement before fitting it - this may require lubricating the pivot, or adjusting it somehow to free it up. </p>

"Why are spare wheels smaller than normal wheels?","7723","","<p>I want to purchase a VW Ameo Highline. It comes with stock tyres (185/60 R15), and alloy rims. The spare wheel, however, is a standard steel rim (non-alloy) with 175/70 R14 tyres. The dealer explained this to me as an international norm, that a spare wheel is to be sparingly used. </p>

<p>It made sense to me but I had never heard this before. Do all cars that come factory fitted with alloys follow this rule?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Do all cars that come factory fitted with alloys follow this rule?</p>

<p>No, there are three basic options that I see all the time.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>An Emergency wheel - Will get you to the next tire shop or gas station. Has a speed limit of 55/mph and is smaller than normal. Also has a limited range. Usually 50 miles or so. There will be a label on the tire. Used to cut costs, and to reduce required storage space. Popular on small cars.</p></li>
<li><p>A full size spare - A normal sized wheel without the fancy rim. Just like the normal wheel but looks different. Common on work trucks, vans, SUVs where the size is needed for the weight or load, but there is plenty of space to spare. Optionally, these ""full size spares"" can some times be bought with matching rims. </p></li>
<li><p>A set of 5 tires and wheels.  This is mostly seen from the factory on newer Jeeps, but is very common for other 4x4 trucks and vehicles to have a matching set of 5 wheels and tires that can be rotated in a 5 tire pattern.  This is common for off road vehicles when tires can be easily popped, but traction is extremely important.  However, many newer Jeeps just have it because it looks nice.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix-a-flat or the like. No spare, but a free can of fix a flat. This is more and more common. Especially on cars with self sealing tires, or electronic sensors that warn you for problems before a blow out. Really good in town, not so great outside of town where you have to travel a long distance.</p></li>

"How does a 'very small stone' hit on the windscreen creates long cracks coming out of it?","7722","","<p>Recently I got my windshield hit by an extremely small sized stone. Gradually that small hit created a long crack on my windshield, it's been a month and I guess the crack has stopped with the elongation/growth.</p>

<p>My questions are:<br>
1) How does that very tiny hit eventually creates foot long cracks?<br>
1) In how much time should I get the windshield replaced after the incident?<br>
2) What level of risk is there if I continue using the cracked windshield?</p>
","<p>While I think the other two answers are good, I think there is a better explanation of what is happening with the windshield when a rock hits it.</p>

<p>When a rock hits a windshield and puts a ""bullseye"" into the surface, it creates areas within it called <a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/a/18184/4152""><strong><em>stress risers</em></strong></a>. Stress risers cause places in any structure where the stress is localized to a small area. Small flexes in the substance of the window causes more stress in these given areas. Because the stress is localized and cannot disperse across the entire windshield as it normally would, it causes cracks to form. The crack acts as a boundary layer, a place the stress cannot go through. The stress gets to the crack and can either go left or right. The bullseye acts as another boundary layer, so the stress goes the opposite direction and the crack lengthens. Once the stress has a channel to run though, it will continue to follow that channel (path of least resistance) until it hits another boundary layer (usually another edge or another crack) or until the stress is abated enough the crack does not lengthen. Hot and cold cycles can make the crack elongate due to unequal stresses forming on either side of the crack (think of it as pushing and pulling on either side of the crack).</p>

<p>Your questions 2&amp;3 are very subjective, as this depends on your local laws and your threshold or tolerance for looking through the cracks. Where I live, any crack which is on the driver's side of the window will cause you to fail your safety inspection. The main reason being that it impedes the driver's ability to see the road and surroundings. If the crack stays on the passenger's side, there is no issue. Me personally, I don't like cracked windshields. I don't like looking through them. I don't like other people looking at my vehicle and thinking something bad about me. <em>These are all just personal things</em> ... like I said, subjective. As was stated, the bullseye alone (with cracks less than 1"") can be fixed. </p>

<p>In the US, if you have full coverage insurance on your vehicle, most insurance companies will pay for it to be fixed without the deductible. If you don't have full coverage, or if your insurance won't cover it, you should to be able to find a mobile windshield repairman to do the work for under $100 fairly easily. There are kits you can purchase to do this yourself, but I doubt the results will be anywhere close to stellar. I've seen what goes into doing the work to fix them. It takes some specialized training to really make it look good and for it to be a long lasting fix.</p>

"Would leaving the headlights on for two hours permanently damage the battery?","7712","","<p>Today I accidentally left my Hyundai i30's headlights on for two hours.</p>

<p>When I tried to start the car the battery was very weak at first and I had no power in acceleration.</p>

<p>Then I turned off the car and restarted it. I drove it around the block a couple of times and seemingly it was at normal power.</p>

<p>What should I expect when I turn the car on tomorrow? Is it likely that I've caused permanent damage to the battery?</p>
","<p>If you got a low point discharge, your battery is damaged. Some chemical processes can not be reconverted from that point. If you drive around for some time, your battery will get warm and have a little bit more charge then cold. That could be enough to start the car once again. You don't loose anything if you try to charge you battery. Maybe you are lucky. Otherwise if your car does not start tomorrow, you will need a new battery. </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>  </p>

<p>The border for deep discharge is about 20% of the maximal charge. If you reach this level ( under 20 % ) a lot of lead was resolved in acid and your pH-value decreases. That brings you a sulphation of the active mass and causes a capacity fade. Your plates corrode. Lead sulfate becomes crystalized and can not be transformed to acid anymore.   </p>

"Car jerks when stopped in traffic","7711","","<p>I replaced the PCV valve of my Toyota Vitz 2007 some time back, due to oil level reducing. After I got the car back from the mechanic, it had this weird behavior of making a sudden jerk after five or six seconds when car is stopped in traffic. Also, it jerked when shifted to drive gear from parking gear. Jerk is not that violent and it does not make the stopped car actually move forward. Its like the car is trying to jump forward.</p>

<p>After about a week or so, this got automatically fixed.</p>

<p>I repaired the car again from the same mechanic, this time a soldering job of an electrical cable which supplies power to one of the spark plugs. After I got the car back, it showed similar jerking behavior. Now its been three or four days and jerking has got resolved to some extent, but still car does not feel the same as it previously was.</p>

<p>(About the soldering job, two wires which supplied power to a spark coil had been damaged at the point the wires connect to the socket at spark coil. Mechanic told me that its hard to find spare sockets so he soldered the wires. But I don't think the cause of jerking is related to this, because the same behavior occurred previously too, when there was nothing wrong with the wires)</p>

<p>I asked the mechanic whether he did anything else other than soldering the cables, but he said no. But, he should have disconnected the battery, because the time in the dashboard clock was incorrect when I got the car back.</p>

<ul>
<li>My car had been idling roughly for some time now.</li>
<li>Earlier the gas mileage was about 12.5km/l. But from few months back, it has droped to about 10km/l.</li>
<li>After the repair, when the car is at a stop, it does not properly go
forward when I release the break (without stepping on the gas
paddle).</li>
</ul>

<p>What could be the reason for this jerking behavior?</p>
","<p>It turned out to be a result of disconnecting the battery from the vehicle. When the battery is disconnected, the ECU forgets what it has self learned about when to switch gears, how much to open the throttle valve, etc.</p>

"How does a lock-up torque converter work, exactly?","7702","","<p>I am familiar with the general workings of a torque converter. The engine-side blade pushes the fluid, the fluid spins the transmission-side blade.

<p><strong>HOW</strong> does this happen? Is it a clutch-like friction thing? I've read different things in different places, so are there different implementations from different manufacturers?</p>
","<p>There is an internal clutch that locks the converter when engaged by the torque converter clutch solenoid. Fluid pressure it routed through the input shaft into the converter clutch, which engages the clutch.</p>

<p>If it is non electronic transmission it uses a pressure switch inside the transmission to engage the solenoid (gm calls it a tcc solenoid) at a given speed and current gear (gear is usually 3rd and overdrive, if electronic, the trans computer controls lockup using the solenoid.

","<p>Honestly, it would be best to put on a spare.  Chances are you could make it to the shop with no problem, but there's an increased risk.  The tire could rip and rapidly deflate, or it could leak fast at an moment and leave you with less control than normal.  Usually you would just pull over with no danger, but now what?  Change your tire in the middle of the road?</p>

<p>If you have no spare, drive on the least busy streets as possible, and go a reasonable speed and be ready to pull over any second.  Keep your distance and plenty of braking room, etc.</p>

<p>If you have a spare, another bonus is that you don't have to wait at the shop to get your tire fixed.  You can drop off the wheel and have them fix it while you shop nearby or something.   I normally take a tire off to have it fixed even if its just a nuisance pinhole because it's easier for me to drop it off and pick it up hours later or even the next day.</p>

","<p>Most of the time on the Mazda3 the blame is defective engine mounts,  they are too soft.  Its the upper mount that's the prevalent one. There are aftermarket replacements available.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now there are a few other things that it could be. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Massive air leaks,  check the EGR valve. It would be a good idea to do a smoke test on the intake and engine. The test will show any leaks.</p></li>
<li><p>Clean the MAF and the throttle body (Do Not Use Throttle Body Cleaner on MAF), disconnect the battery first. Check the wires, with it running wiggle the wires. When restarting don't touch the gas pedal and leave all accessory items off (a/c and etc.), the car will run erratic until the ECU  relearns timing and fuel maps. If car stalls restart until it stays running, without touching the gas pedal. </p></li>
<li><p>Fuel pump issues. Electrical (a) and fuel pressure (b) test-</p>

<p>a) Check pump fuse. Check the voltage at the fuel pump (determine whether or not the charge that's leaving the fuse is getting to the pump). Perform a drop test using a voltmeter (Check to make sure that the power wire shows the full voltage and the grounding wire shows that it's grounded properly. If you show more than one volt difference, that means you've got a problem with corroded wires, or that you've got issues with the circuit on either the positive or negative side).</p>

<p>b) Check fuel filter, resistance should be minimal. Use a fuel pressure guage and hook it to the fuel pump fitting. Rev the engine while checking guage. Let the engine warm up slightly, then check the pressure both at idle speed and at the rated speed listed in your pump specifications. If the needle doesn't move then the pump is defective. </p></li>
<li><p>Clogged purge solenoid valve. Sometimes it sticks open and lets unmetered fuel vapors into the engine. This causes the computer to adjust fuel trims which affect the idle. It is hard to check the purge solenoid without a scan tool, because they don't typically fail permanently. Plug the solenoid and line, check if idle problem gone.</p></li>
<li><p>Non-iridium spark plugs. Replace with correct ones. </p>

"Why do cars allow you to shift from Reverse to Neutral/Drive without brakes?","7641","","<p>Every automatic transmission car I've driven (not sure if all do this) allow you to shift from Reverse to Neutral and from Neutral to Drive (and therefore Reverse all the way to Drive) without pressing the brake or hitting the little shift lock on the gear selector. However, it doesn't let you go the opposite direction from Drive to Reverse, or Reverse to Park, etc.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/4048/switching-from-reverse-to-drive-always-stop-completely"">this question</a> if you don't stop completely before shifting its possible to damage your transmission. Some cars apparently mitigate this damage but it still seems strange to even allow the opportunity.</p>

<p>So why would car designers give you the feature to shift from reverse to drive without hitting the brake of it can cause damage? Even if it didn't cause damage why would they not allow you to shift in the reverse order without braking?</p>

<p>Please note I'm not asking <strong>how</strong> this is done, I'm asking <strong>why</strong> it is like this.</p>
","<p>I don't have reference for this, but believe the reason for the positive lockout going from drive to reverse is so you don't <em>accidentally</em> shift from drive to reverse while at speed. Can you imagine going 60 mph down the road and dropping it from drive into reverse? You can expect catastrophic consequences for your transmission if you were to do this. If there weren't a positive lock to bring it out of drive going to reverse, how easy would it be for you to accidentally move the shift lever (considering a floor shift lever) from drive if it wasn't in place. Also consider driving down the road at that speed and punching it up into reverse. You would not only be putting your own life in danger, you'd be putting everyone around in you danger with the very real possibility of a wreck in the process.</p>

<p>My <em>belief</em> is that <strong>you can go from reverse to drive without stopping is for convenience sake</strong>. It <em>is</em> very likely you can damage the transmission by not stopping the vehicle between reverse to drive shifting (we used to call this a neutral drop in days of yore). The difference here is the speed at which you are moving when going in reverse is not that great. You most likely are not going to <em>accidentally</em> move the shift lever down from reverse into drive. I'm not saying it won't happen, but even if you did, the damage would not be as instantaneous as it would be going in the opposite direction. There is also a lot less possibility of a wreck at those speeds, so that is a consideration as well.</p>

<p>Can someone give me a list of parts that I should expect to pay for?</p>
","<p>To replace the clutch technically you only need a new clutch. However most people will purchase a Clutch Kit that will usually contain</p>

<ol>
<li>Clutch</li>
<li>Pressure Plate</li>
<li>Thrust/ Release Bearing</li>
<li>Pilot/Spigot Bearing</li>
<li>Alignment Tool  </li>
</ol>

<p>The last 2 items are not always included in a clutch kit and they are not always necessary, although an alignment tool does make life a little easier (technically this is a tool and not a 'part').<br>
Depending on your location, Ebay can be a pretty good resource for getting a price estimate on whatever clutch parts you are looking for – you don’t have to buy from there, but at least you can get an idea what sort of prices are appropriate.</p>

<p>It is usually recommended that you get the flywheel machined also, this is a service you can get from most transmission places. Depending on the condition of your flywheel you <em>can</em> skip this part, but as I said it is the recommended practice.</p>

<hr>

<p>Something to be aware of is that it is a non-trivial job to replace a clutch. It involves separating the gearbox from the engine because the clutch sits between the two, in order to do this one of those two items has to be removed from the vehicle, usually it’s the gearbox. Because of the amount of effort required to remove and subsequently refit a gearbox it is often appropriate to do other maintenance at the same time that can only be done when the gearbox is removed or is much easier accomplished when the gearbox is removed.  </p>

<p>If you are paying a mechanic to do a clutch replacement then the cost of labour will greatly outweigh the cost of parts.<br>
This makes a clutch replacement a great DIY job for a home mechanic because while it’s a time consuming job, it’s not a highly technical job and can be done with a fairly basic set of tools – the most specialised of which is probably a torque wrench. But if you are going to attempt to do a clutch replacement yourself for the first time, be aware that it’s a lot more complex than just changing your oil and spark plugs. Do your research, get hold of a workshop manual for your vehicle, read the clutch replacement section thoroughly. Also get someone else to give you a hand as it can be a tough job to do on your own.</p>

Otherwise go to step #5</li>

<li> Charge the battery. 3 minute charge test. Hook up the charger to the battery set the charger to 30 - 40 amps at 3 minutes check the voltage while charging if it's above 15.5 volts replace the battery it will not accept a charge, if below 15.5 volts reduce the setting on the charger to 2 - 10 amp range (less is better, fast charging reduces the overall life of the battery) and continue to charge the battery until the gauge on the battery charger show close to zero amps.

     <br /><br /><b>With a load tester</b> load the battery to 1/2 the CCA (Cold Cranking Amps) for 15 seconds while watching the voltage it should not drop below 9.6 volts if it does replace the battery. Once the load is removed the battery voltage should recover to at least 12.24 volts within 5 minutes of the load test if not replace the battery. 

     <br /><br /><b>Testing without a load tester</b>, this doesn't put as much of a load on the battery as the test above so if it passes this the battery could still be bad, if it fails however you can be sure the battery is bad. Disable the vehicle from cranking by disconnecting the coil wire or fuel pump relay. Turn on the bright headlights and crank the vehicle for 15 seconds (no longer than this and do not repeat this test within 3 minutes or damage to the starter can occur) with a DVOM on the battery see if the voltage drops below 9.6 volts or does not recover after the test as mentioned above. If either of those two fail then the battery is bad.</li>

<p>Do you live in an area without salt, birds, tree sap, pollution, abrasive sand or road tar?  Do you also drive around with brake pads that don't emit corrosive dust?  If so, then you might be okay to avoid washing.  If not, then yes, there are plenty of benefits.</p>

<p>What's practical for your situation?  If you can't wash the car for a while because of life circumstances, the point is moot.  </p>

<p>Here in the Northeast USA, car washing is actually seriously important.  For example, salt is a year-round fact of life here in Rhode Island.  In the winter, it's used to treat the roads during snowy weather.  In the summer, it's fun to go to the coast (admittedly, Rhode Island is basically all coast but still...) where the wind is picking up all that salt spray and misting it all over the car.  Even better, seagulls drop blobs of acidic smears of grossness all over that deliciously salted car.</p>

<p>Some people will try to argue that clearcoat and paint will protect the metal of the car.  While that is technically true for a while, neither is sorcery.  Any sort of corrosive or abrasive will eventually wear through that protection and start rusting.  As a practical example, that gravel shot into the hood of your car by the truck in front of you may have chipped the hood down to the metal.  It almost certainly took off the clear coat and a layer of paint. </p>

<p>Any sort of washing will get all that nastiness away from the car with the side benefit of making it look nicer.  And remember, anything is better than nothing: I spray out the underside of my car while I'm washing it.  I'm not using special undercarriage spray or anything like that, just a straight up garden hose.  The startling amount of sand and salt that pours out from under the car could be used to make little castles in my driveway. </p>

<p>It's also a convenient time to just walk around the vehicle and check for any issues.  Is that piece of trim coming loose?  How long has that screw been missing?  Here's a rock chip: I better get some touch-up paint into that right away.  </p>

<p>All of the above is bounded by reality.  In the winters here, sometimes it's just too cold to wash the car for months at a time.  Some of those times, washing the car is effectively moot anyway since all that dirt is getting hidden under layers of snow....</p>

<p><strong>Pro tip</strong>: a clean car is much more pleasant to work on. Even if you don't handle your own maintenance, the techs who do will be grateful that they aren't working in a gross muddy rust pit. </p>

"What are the advantages of electric and hydraulic power steering?","7614","","<p>I don't know if I should get electric or hydraulic (where you put the fluid in) power steering...</p>

<p>Which one is more reliable (in terms of repairs)? Stats would be nice ;)</p>

<p>What are the disadvantages and advantages of each one? </p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>What's the difference between the two in terms of how they work?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In both cases, the power steering simply adds some force to the steering when it detects the driver is trying to turn the wheels. Simply, in one case there is an electric motor to add this force, while in the other hydraulic liquid is used. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is one more efficient at steering than the other?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A hydraulic pump is always in motion while the engine is on. Since any hydraulic system has some internal friction, this means the engine has to consume some power to turn it. The steering pump is permanently connected to the engine crankshaft through a belt and pulley, which also takes some power to keep turning.</p>

<p>On the other hand, an electrical power assist will only draw power when it is actually being used (i.e. the driver is turning the steering). The electrical system also uses an existing source of power, the car alternator - that is already a required piece of equipment for the other needs of the vehicle. But, lacking the extra pulley and pump needed by a hydraulic steering system (and perhaps also an extra belt, depending on engine design), some energy savings are to be expected.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Which one is more reliable (in terms of repairs)? Stats would be nice ;)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No stats ... perhaps because electrical power assist is still a relatively recent technology. Even so, since electric systems have less components and no hydraulic valves and gaskets (so no leaks!), in theory they should be more reliable than hydraulic. In practice, hydraulic power assist has been around for very many years, so it has the advantage of being a well-known, mature technology. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What are the disadvantages and advantages of each one?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The feeling of each system is slightly different from the driver's point of view. From an objective standpoint, perhaps the only statement that can be made is that hydraulic assistance dies instantly when the engine is turned off. Some electrical systems can be programmed to continue running from the battery, though this should be avoided for extended periods of time since the battery will drain. Electric systems can also be perceived to be slightly more reactive to driver input.</p>

<p>From a subjective standpoint, each driver could test different cars with each of these systems to find out which suits best his/her purposes and driving style.</p>

"What is the average radiator capacity on 6 cylinder engines?","7599","","<p>Yesterday I drained the radiator on a 99 Monte Carlo.
Owner's manual states that it should take 11.6 quarts  (2.85 gallons).</p>

<p>I removed the petcock, flushed the system by running a hose into the top and running the engine.  </p>

<p>I ran the engine and watched the temperature with the hose running non-stop into the radiator and the petcock open and the water running through.
Finally, when the engine came up to normal temp I turned on the heater full blast and could feel heat, making sure the thermostat opened up.</p>

<p>After that I shut it all off.  Turned off the hose.  Left the petcock open and waited another 20 minutes until the radiator was completely drained.</p>

<p>Finally, I went to fill the radiator with premixed 50/50 coolant, but when I did the radiator filled up before even the first gallon was empty.  Probably about 3/4 of a gallon.</p>

<p>I capped the radiator up, started it up and checked again later but it seems to still be full.</p>

<p>Can you think of any reasons that might occur?<br>
Is the manual wrong?  Does it only take 1 gallon or so?</p>

<p>Do you think there might've still been water in the radiator?</p>

<p>Is it possible there was still water in the engine block or however that works?</p>

<p>Also, I did drain the overflow and there wasn't any in there either. I filled it back to the cold line with antifreeze/coolant.</p>
","<p>Once your system expels as much fluid as it can via the pump there is still an additional amount of fluid that is left in the block and other areas that the pump can't push out because there isn't enough fluid and pump is just attempting to push air through the system.</p>

"How to track down an intermittent battery drain?","7592","","<p>I know there are several questions on here about finding the source of a battery drain (like <a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/91/battery-drains-by-itself-when-vehicle-is-parked-parasitic-draw"">Battery drains by itself when vehicle is parked (parasitic draw)</a> ).  However I don't think the answers address my problem.</p>

<p>Occasionally when I go to use my car in the morning, it will have a dead battery.  Because it is an intermittent problem (on the order of once every couple of months), it's no surprise that mechanics find nothing when doing an overnight draw test.  That is to say that the problem has never occurred when the car is in the shop.</p>

<p>FWIW, I have not left the lights on on the nights that the battery drains.  I can't rule out any similarly stupid mistake, but at least its not the lights.  Also, we tried the simple step of replacing the battery about 6 months ago.  The load tests done by various mechanics never implicated the battery, but we did it anyway.</p>

<p>So my question is, what strategies should I use to <strong>track down an intermittent battery draining draw</strong>?</p>
","<p>You could set up a low voltage relay in-line on the battery ground cable (obviously only for when parked at night). Even a small current from an activated circuit (like the door light) should cause the relay to trip. Use the relay to turn on an alarm so you can go see what's causing the draining. </p>

<p>If you don't have a relay, a flashlight lightbulb wired in series with the ground cable will do the same thing, show when current is flowing. A multimeter is more sensitive, but you have to watch it carefully. It will always register a few milliamps to keep the radio stations set but if it goes up, you will know.</p>

<p>It's going to take some testing with a multimeter to tell how much voltage will develop during small current draws, but it's probably at least 10 watts to drain a healthy battery overnight during the summer. Use the dome light to calibrate.</p>

<p>I had to use this method last year and the culprit was the remote locking system picking up my wife's keys somehow and activating the lock solenoid all night long.</p>

"Why don't I get shocked constantly?","7568","","<p>Noobie question here;
NOTE: I don't understand electrics much.</p>

<p>If a car's electrical system grounds to the bodywork (usually to the negative terminal) so that the electricity flows through the metal of the car, why don't I get shocked whilst touching the paintwork or touching the grounds themselves whist the battery is still connected and the car is running?</p>

<p>I've never understood electronics, and it just made me think that the bodywork is usually metal as well, so why doesn't that do anything in terms of shocking you? </p>

<p>The only thing I can somewhat guess is that I'm not touching the positive terminal of the battery and/or anything connected to it to put myself in line with the circuit, but that explaination doesn't sound right, because I can touch both terminals and not get anything. I don't understand how electronics work at all in a car, as you can probably tell, lol.
Cheers in advance! :) </p>
","<p>The reason is that very little current is flowing into the body of the car and that current is only at 12 volts which is not enough to penetrate dry human skin. For example, if a person puts a dry finger across the terminals of a 9v battery, they will not feel anything (but if a person puts the battery to their tongue, they will feel a tingle).</p>

<p>If current was actively flowing to the body of the car, then it would be a ""short"" and would cause the battery to be rapidly drained.</p>

<p>To easily go through average human skin, about 50 volts is needed. If the person is sweaty, the number can be much lower. If the current is exposed to the blood very little voltage is needed. In one case a guy electrocuted himself with a 9 volt battery by connecting probes to each terminal, then holding each probe in a hand and piercing his thumb with the probes. This allowed the current to directly access his blood and go through his heart.</p>

<p>After that I drove the car 2-3km.</p>

<p>My question is will this make any problems to my car or is the amount negligible?</p>
","<p>The main problems from misfueling a diesel car with petrol stem from the fact that (as Zaid points out) petrol doesn't provide the lubrication effect of diesel fuel and as a solvent it can actually <em>inhibit</em> the diesel that is there from providing lubrication and this can do nasty, <em>nasty</em> things to the fuel pump which can then have knock-on effects to other components - including small shavings of metal (called <em>swarf</em>) from the damage to un-lubricated pump components getting passed down to the engine which can do significant damage to the injectors in modern diesels that run more advanced injection systems such as common-rail or VW's PD engines.</p>

<p>Additionally there is the potential for petrol to eat away certain seals in the fuel system and possibly the fuel lines themselves.</p>

<p>While this all sounds pretty scary the good news for you is that these scenarios generally involve much larger concentrations of petrol in the mix which isn't the case here.</p>

<p>I'm also fairly certain the engine in your car will be either the XUD9 or DW8  which aren't common-rail injection engines but used Bosch mechanical injectors instead (PSA brand their common-rail engines as ""HDi"" and in the Xsara only the 1.4 and 2.0 diesels in the facelifted car used it). And that small an amount of petrol which has been diluted to about 3% isn't significant enough to do any damage. </p>

<p>If you're wanting to be extra safe or if you aren't going to be using the car much over the next few days then it would be prudent to keep it topped up with diesel to further dilute the petrol.</p>

","<p>As far as the fuses are concerned, it's never a bad idea to add a fuse to a particular section of a circuit that you're concerned about. For the high-beam fuses, in particular, I would start conservatively. Your average high beam (for a normal headlight) is 55 or 65 watts. In a 12 V circuit, that's less than 6 amps nominally. If you put in a 10 amp fuse, you should be ok. I have looked at some amperage vs wire diameter charts and 20 amps seems a bit too close to the 24 amp maximum for my comfort levels. To reiterate, it's never an issue to start conservatively on these things, and I think 10 amps will suit you just fine.</p>

","<p>Usually coolant temperature problems as you described (without leaks) are caused by any of the following or a combination thereof:</p>

<ul>
<li>Partially blocked or missing ducting to the radiator so either not enough air reaches the radiator or it goes past the radiator instead of through it. This should be relatively easy to eyeball.</li>
<li>Thermostat not opening fully (or stuck open, so the motor runs cold). The result would be an engine that does run OK for a while but would get (too) hot when the car is either at standstill or under more load than usual. Unfortunately the only way to really figure out if it's the thermostat is putting a new one - I tend to like OEM ones, and I'd go for the OEM opening temperature as well. Don't bother with a thermostat that opens earlier as this might mask the 'real' fault.</li>
<li>Partially blocked radiator. This usually manifests itself under heavier loads (think long uphill stretches with the aircon at full blast). Easiest way to find out is if you 'hover' the palm of your hand over the cooling fins with the engine off and see if you notice areas of the radiator being cooler than others. Don't touch the radiator and don't be tempted to do it with the engine running in case the fans spin up. Better way to do is to use a remote infrared thermometer.</li>
<li>Issues with the waterpump not flowing enough coolant.</li>
<li>One of the fans not operating correctly. A lot of cars with a/c have two fans, one is often supposed to run when the a/c is on, the other one cycles off and on based on coolant temperature. If the a/c fan doesn't work you're losing a lot of cooling capacity as the a/c evaporator blocks part of the radiator.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'd check the ducting, and the fan(s) first, then consider replacing the thermostat. Thermostats don't last forever and if there are deposits in the cooling system, this can shorten their life considerably.</p>

<p>You can always go to a separate mechanic for an independent opinion. In fact, I would recommend it. However, it isn't that hard to diagnose. All you have to know is what you're looking for, which in this case is <em>where</em> the oil is coming from. If it's leaking from the front cover (which covers the timing belt) just below where the cam sprocket is located, it's a <em>pretty good bet</em> the seal is what's leaking.</p>

<p>If it is leaking and there is oil on the belt, change it. Oil will deteriorate the belt and it's one piece of equipment on your vehicle which you don't want compromised. Since timing belts are most easily obtained as kits (which are usually not much more expensive than a the belt itself), your best bet is to replace all of the same parts so you can be assured of another 60k trouble free miles.</p>

  <li>In the timing belt removal section of my repair manual, it says not to rotate camshaft sprockets after the timing belt has been removed, else the valves will be damaged.

<p>I believe they are saying this so as you don't put undue stress on your timing belt (coming off and/or going on). When you <em>are</em> removing the sprocket, you still don't want it to turn any. You need to lock the cam in place and then loosen the bolt for the sprocket. </p>

<p>I'm not going to tell you what to do, but needless to say, this isn't a job for the uninitiated. There are a lot of gotchas. The big one being aligning your cam timing. You didn't say, but I believe your engine has four cam shafts which have to be time along with the crank. If you don't get this right, you will most likely have cost yourself an engine. If this is something you <em>fell</em> you must do, have a competent friend come help/watch to ensure you are doing things right. You can watch some of the videos on YouTube, which may be of assistance.</p>

<p>NOTE: I just looked online at the engine which you <em>probably</em> have. Depending on which one it is (2.0TC, 2.5, or 2.5TC), it could have 2 or 4 cams. If this is one with 4 cams, I believe it has cam phasers (used in variable valve timing). If so, I <strong><em>WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU NOT DO IT YOURSELF</em></strong>. There are just too many variables to try and tell you to avoid while doing the work and putting it back together. </p>

","<p>As Nick stated, try and get one of the same value. If one of the same value is not available, you can always go up in CCA/ah, but never go down. Vehicles are spec'ed with a certain battery because that is what it needs to operate the starter to get the engine going. With a lower CCA/ah, you run the risk of dragging the starter, which can cause it damage. The specific CCA/ah also gives the accessories enough power without over taxing the alternator to keep up with the demand. It's kind of a symbiotic relationship.</p>

<p>The biggest thing you'll need to worry about is form factor. If the battery has too large of footprint it won't fit in the hole and allow you to bolt it down. If it's too tall, you won't be able to shut the hood, and shorting top post batteries across the hood is not a good thing ... think of thermal nuclear meltdown on an automobile scale.</p>

<p>What are some probable explanations?</p>
","<p>Much of what makes wheels appear dirty is brake dust. Brake dust is wear particles from the brake pads and rotors (or from linings and drums, in the case of drum brakes). The braking effort in most vehicles is not equally distributed between front and rear wheels--this is by design. Generally the front wheels do most of the braking work, since weight naturally transfers to the front tires during braking, giving them better grip.</p>

<p>More of your braking is taking place at the front wheels, so more brake dust is being generated on the front wheels. This is generally not a cause for concern.</p>

<p>That said, if one wheel is suddenly far dirtier than all other wheels, it could indicate a stuck brake caliper causing the brakes to drag. I don't suspect this in the case you described, where both fronts are dirtier than both rears. I think if you look closely at most cars on the road you will find that it is normal for front wheels to be dirtier than rear wheels.</p>

<p>My question is: do <em>modern cars</em> need it too? I have VW Golf VI (year 2009) and I normally leave the system on for a couple of seconds before starting the engine... but am I being too cautious, or does the car <em>really</em> need it?</p>

"AC clutch engages but still no cold air","7436","","<p>I've been reading for a week or so about how AC systems work and problems they could have.  One consistent thing I've read is to check how the compressor clutch reacts when you turn on AC - if it disengages then it doesn't have enough pressure and likely has a refrigerant leak.</p>

<p>My 94 Cherokee (apparently not great AC systems to begin with) seems to be blowing only slightly cool air when AC is on max settings.  However, my clutch seems to be running fine.  It never disengages or stutters even for a second.  Aside from refrigerant leak, what are some other reasons why an AC system would not be producing much cold air?</p>

<p>I figure I'd ask here before I bought some UV dye to try to track down a leak.</p>
","<p>If we're ruling out the possibility of a leak in the system and you're still not getting cold air then it's probably due to normal wear/age. </p>

<p>The refrigerant system is supposed to be a sealed system, but this is rarely perfect.  If the AC system has never been serviced or it's been many years (6+) since it has been you could be just experiencing normal leakage.  Cars are exposed to road vibrations, temperature extremes, and just time.  Due to this the seals on the system breakdown slowly. The refrigerant will leak away very slowly and air will be introduced in to the system. You'll continue to have good enough pressure so the clutch engages but not enough to cool the car. </p>

<p>Rebuilding the system should make it like new and give you a good 10 - 15 years of life out of it.  There's a cost/benefit of rebuilding the system vs a periodic vacuum &amp; recharge. </p>

<p>If memory serves me correctly 1994 would have been within the range of when cars were switching from r12 to r134a.  My experience is that the first cars to come with r134a had very poor AC cooling in comparison to earlier cars or current cars. </p>

</blockquote>



<p>Since the days of taking drivers ed (many years back). I was told that when you encounter a steep or extended downgrade, to conserve your brakes and help increase braking performance it's a good idea to shift from Drive to 2nd (at least on automatic transmissions which is all I've driven).</p>

<p>Still, while the advice seemes valid and for the most part it's helped greatly every so often in winter on hilly areas, on a recent trip through upstate New York, I encountered numerous rural hills so steep and long that when I downshifted, I was hitting 3-3.5k RPM peaking at 4k even as I was doing 40mph and breaking heavily (but steadily) to keep the RPMs in check.</p>

<p>Anyway my main question is that when you see those hills with the signs indicating trucks must downshift, is it also a good idea for people driving sedans and other non-commercial vehicles?</p>

<p>The main reason I ask is because I've heard downshifting saves brake pads but can damage the transmision, so the rationale is to avoid downshifting when possible. I've done this for much of my average driving however I definately would love to get a more solid opinion.</p>
","<p><strong>tl,dr</strong>: The short answer is <strong>no</strong>, with caveats.</p>

<p>The longer answer starts with ""well, you can kill your car with anything if you try hard enough.""</p>

<p>Let's use specific examples of when you should use your transmission for engine braking: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waimea_Canyon_State_Park"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Waimea Canyon</a> or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Washington_Auto_Road"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mount Washington</a>.  In either case, you are descending thousands of vertical feet at significant grades.  If you were to ride your brakes the entire way down, it's highly likely that the brakes would overheat and become less and less effective until they were essentially useless.  </p>

<p>This would be followed by a loud crashing sound.  </p>

<p>In fact, at the Mount Washington Auto Road, they will not let you proceed up or down the hill unless you are in ""2"" on an automatic transmission vehicle.</p>

<p><strong>Caveat</strong>: when you intentionally put your car in a lower gear and drive down a steep grade, you are giving gravity control of your engine revs.  As I say, it is sometimes important to use engine braking (we've discussed the benefits to <a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/678/least-wear-and-tear-most-fuel-efficient-method-of-coasting-in-a-manual-transmiss"">fuel economy</a> before).  However, <em>you</em> are the driver of the vehicle so <em>you</em> have to make the call about how much is too much.</p>

<p>A simple rule of thumb: the redline is still the redline.  If your engine braking is pushing the limits of the rated engine speed, it's time to use the brake pedal and slow down significantly and, possibly, drop down another gear.  Otherwise, you're going to break your engine in an effort to save your brake pads.</p>

<p>My scheduled service is next week, but I'm concerned that driving the car now can cause further damage to the car (I afraid that this might void the warranty because ""I am misusing the car"", is my fear warranted?). There is also an issue of whether it is safe to drive this car.</p>

<p>So, should I send the car immediately to the service center? Can I still drive the car in the mean time, will driving it cause further damage?</p>
","<p>Many modern cars have advanced traction control systems which aim to prevent a loss of control, most of these operate by adding computer control to each individual brake, with a central computer using sensor data to determine how much to brake each wheel. These systems are designed to fail in a way that allows your brakes to still work - they aren't simply going to lock up on you - however you will lose any protection the system gives you. Some people's driving style (hard acceleration, hard braking) and the conditions they regularly drive in (snow, ice, gravel) make this more of a hazard than others. If you drive like you're in Super Mario Kart on snow then this system may have been keeping you from running into a tree, if you are a normal driver it may rarely be needed. </p>

<p>Driving with a malfunctioning ABS system shouldn't damage anything, and it shouldn't invalidate your warranty - many cars allow it to be disabled using a button, however if you are concerned about it then call your dealership. In fact I'd call them in any case as your car is under warranty and this should be covered. They may bring your car in earlier, or they may need a couple of days to get the right parts. You lose nothing by making that call. </p>

","<p>To answer your question directly, adding the 95 to the 92 in your tank will not cause any real problems, in the short term. Once you have used the tank full you can carry on filling up with the recommended 95. Modern engine ECU programming will adjust the timing of your engine, knock sensors, to minimise or prevent engine 'pinking' caused by the lower octane fuel. Pinking can and will cause engine damage, and can be identified by a rattling from the engine, especially under acceleration. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Once a clutch starts to slip a little bit it can go all the way to useless pretty quick.</p>

<p>Once it's slipping regularly it creates a great deal of heat from friction.  When the steel and neoprene plates are locked together there isn't any heat be released from friction because they are locked into place.</p>

<p>Your plates are probably glazed from over heating.  You can take them out and use 250 grit sandpaper to take the glazing off of everything.  Be sure you clean them exceptionally well when are done as you don't want any of the grit leftover getting into your engine.</p>

<p>This trick could be permanent solution until it actually where's out, or a stop gap.  You'll find out.</p>

","<p>Actually, the wires that you have are thus:</p>

<p>Big fat gnarly wire is the main power wire, as you surmised. It comes directly from the battery. It provides power to the solenoid, not to the starter though (well, ultimately it gets to the starter ... I'll explain). There are two parts to the starter (in most vehicles). The larger part which actually attaches to the engine is the starter motor. This, as the name implies, is the part which actually gets the engine to spin. The smaller part is called the solenoid. The solenoid has two purposes. Its first job is to move the starter gear into position so it will contact the engine flywheel (or flexplate depending on type of transmission). The second thing it does is to act as a relay to energize the starter motor.</p>

<p>The other two wires is where your understanding goes astray. One of these wires provides power to the solenoid to energize it. This wire gets energized when you turn the key switch from the ""on"" position to the ""start"" position. (I'm pretty sure on this next part ... someone correct me if I'm wrong ...) The second wire you are looking at provides full 12v power to the ignition system (coil) during starting. This makes it so the spark plugs provide a little extra <em>umph</em> during that process and hopefully allows your engine to start quicker. It pulls this power from the energizer wire as it is only needed during starting, so is a convenient place to have it.</p>

<p>There isn't a ground wire going to the starter. It utilizes the the metal connection of the starter case attached to the engine itself as the ground. The engine is grounded to the body and usually directly to the battery.</p>

<p>My next step is to flush the oil by repeatedly filling/emptying until I do not smell gas. I also plan on replacing some of the fuel lines that are in bad shape.</p>

<p>So my question is: could there be something else wrong with the engine that I am missing? Do I need to replace the carburetor float as well? Any tips would be much appreciated!</p>
","<p>More than likely what the problem is, your float in the fuel bowl is shot. When the float is shot (ie: doesn't float correctly in the fuel), too much fuel is let into the carburetor and causes the exact issues you are talking about. </p>

<p>You may be able to get a new float and needle valve (very likely), but you may just be better off buying a new carburetor. There are two reasons I say this: 1) there may be more wrong with your carburetor than just the float; 2) the whole carburetor usually doesn't cost too much and is an easy replacement item.</p>

<p>As for the fuel pump ... I didn't think these smaller engines <em>came with a fuel pump</em>? Every small B&amp;S engine I've seen works off of gravity feed for gasoline. Even if it does have a fuel pump, wouldn't it seem to you that <em>having too much gas</em> means the pump is working? The opposite would be true if it weren't. </p>

<p>If you haven't done so, you'll want to change out the oil in the engine before you do anything. Bad oil as you have may cause damage to the rings and bearings. You'll have to run fresh oil anyway, so might as well change it as soon as possible.</p>

<p>One other thing to mention. When you do get this fixed, install an inline fuel cut-off valve. When you finish using the generator, switch it to off while it's running and run the generator out of fuel (without a load on it). In doing so, the carburetor will be nearly if not completely dry. This will make for happier starting the next time you go to use the generator. Just make sure you turn the valve to ""on"" before you start to crank it ;-)</p>

<li><p>How is the air path through the engine?  Remember, the engine is basically a big air pump: there are basic maintenance items that can be checked all the way from the intake through to the exhaust.  Some obvious examples: air filter and muffler.</p></li>
<li><p>Is the car in proper tune?  When were the spark plugs last changed?  Transmission oil?  Belts and hoses?  Fuel filter?</p></li>

","<p>Standard automotive brake fluid (DOT 3,4 and 5.1) are made from polyethylene glycol (PEG). PEG is soluble in water, methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile, benzene, and dichloromethane, and is insoluble in diethyl ether and hexane. A long way of saying it will clean up with soap and water.  </p>

On items like carpet we remove it from the vehicle and slowly, gently use a pressure washer.  You might even see the brake fluid take stains out of some fabrics.</p>

","<p>Frozen batteries can pose a significant hazard. As @Paul has stated the freezing point varies with the state of charge and battery type. A frozen battery can explode with considerable force spraying acid and shrapnel quite a distance. The explosion is caused by the expansion of the gas from charging. The gas is trapped by the ice and unable to vent. The battery case may also be weakened by the expansion of the ice. Some clues the battery is frozen are a distorted or bulging case. You can also remove the covers and see the ice on the top of the lead plates. If you suspect the battery is frozen remove it and allow it to thaw. If the battery has frozen, the damage may be slight enough to be usable after a thaw and recharge or it may be destroyed. The only way to tell is to thaw, charge and test it.</p>

"Why does the power output peak and then drop as engine speed increases?","7204","","<p>I have been looking at the power bands for my car (2000 Opel Agila 1.2) recently, as I want to work out when it is best to change gear and stuff, as I have no life! </p>

<p>This is the approximate graph I made up in Excel comparing power and torque:</p>

<p>Why does the power drop after about 5500 RPM? </p>

<p>Why does the torque drop after 4000 RPM?</p>

<p>I always thought higher speed means more power, so why don't they both keep increasing past these points?</p>

<p><strong>Note: The engine is naturally aspirated...</strong></p>
","<p>Your engine was designed in such a way that it is most efficient between 3500RPM and 5000RPM. That means that the valve timing and camshaft profiles were made in such a way that your engine ""breathes"" best between those speeds. That's why you have the most torque in that region. Another thing is that as the RPM increases, it gets harder and harder to get the optimal amount of air and fuel into the cylinder AND burn it at the optimal rate. The faster the engine revs, the less time there is to suck in, compress, burn and blow out. This affects your ignition timing in turn, which means you start the burn process earlier than you want so that the flame dies just before the exhaust valve opens.</p>

<p>Now, power is essentially just Torque X RPM, so it's just a matter of multiplying your engine speed by your torque to get the power and understand why your power curve looks the way it does.</p>

"Oil pressure warning light stays on longer after oil change in BMW 320d E46","7176","","<p>I have changed the oil a couple of days ago, and I've noticed that the low oil pressure light stays on longer than normal. Normally, it goes out almost immediately (&lt;1s) after starting the engine, while it sometimes takes up to 4 seconds now after the oil change. This only happens during a 'cold start', not when the oil is already warmed up (then it goes out immediately). </p>

<p>The oil level is fine and stable, there are no leaks, and the oil is a high quality 5w30 oil that is specifically recommended for the car; the oil viscosity is identical or nearly identical, I believe, to the previous oil (it was either 5w30 or 5w40). The oil filter I used was a high quality Bosch filter. The car works perfectly. Again; this only happens during a cold start; <em>never</em> during a 'warm start' when the engine oil is already warmed up, nor during driving. </p>

<p>I don't think it's a big deal, but I would like to understand why this is happening. I pretty much rule out a malfunctioning oil pressure sensor, since it only started happening after the oil change. Oil viscosity also seems to be okay, oil levels are fine, the oil and filter quality are both okay,... </p>

<p>I've thought about the clean oil being thinner than the dirty oil causing this rather subtle issue, but I have no idea whether this is true, let alone whether this can cause such a warning.</p>
","<p>It sounds like you are getting drain back. When your engine sits without running for a period of time, most all of the oil in the oil passages drains back into the crank case. When you restart your engine, the oil has to be brought from the pan back up into the oil passages, then you see your oil pressure raise. Since I don't know which year your BMW is, I cannot tell you if there is an oil filter for your car which has an <strong>anti-drain back</strong> feature. If so, this will ensure oil stays in the oil passages and you'll see oil pressure right off the bat, or at least within the second you are accustomed to.

"Why no alternate (hand-cranked, spring-loaded) starter for a car?","7172","","<p>A dead battery is a common and serious problem.  At a minimum it takes time to jump-start the car.  But oftentimes a second car is unavailable, or there's no jumper cables, or a serial killer is chasing you and pounding on your window.</p>

<p>So why don't vehicles come with some alternate way of starting the engine?</p>

<p>Wikipedia says that <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starter_%28engine%29#History"">the original hand-cranks worked but were inconvenient and dangerous</a> for various reasons.  I suspect that with modern engineering these handcranks could become safe, through the use of clutches and today's better-behaved engines.</p>

<p>There's also a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starter_%28engine%29#Spring_starter"">spring starter</a> for which, Wikipedia points out, ""the most common application being backup starting system on seagoing vessels.""</p>

<p>So with the constant push for reliability and features, why have I never seen a car that doesn't rely 100% on a battery to start?  Imagine the marketing: ""Never again be stranded with a dead battery!""  Should be a hit.</p>
","<p>As I’ve read, alternative starting systems nowadays used mostly in commercial, industrial and emergency applications, where it is mission-critical to get it started, such as back-up power generator in the hospital, fire pump on an oil rig, or a life boat. Redundancy is required in some of these situations; in others there is no other option even. There are commercial lorries, mining, quarry and construction vehicles, or generators in remote areas where the only system to start an engine would be the air (pneumatic) or hydraulic start. It is a lot easier to find compressed air than to find reliable electricity to charge a battery in some underdeveloped countries.</p>

<p>Most of those are, of course, are powered by Diesel engines, and do not even need electricity to operate, so some of the vehicles or machines would not even have a battery at all. And, by the way, there are, as I’ve read, hand crank systems on some of those: it is possible to use <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_release"">compression-release mechanism</a> to make it easy to spin the engine by hand to get the flywheel going, then dis-engage CR, and kinetic energy stored in the flywheel should be enough to get it started.</p>

<p>On the other side of the spectrum would be open-wheel race cars (Formulas, Indy, possibly others, such as Le Mans or GT) that do not even have on-board starting system and need to have an external air- or <a href=""http://www.formula1-dictionary.net/starter_motor.html"">electric start device</a> to get going. Obviously, this is done to save weight — this way they do not need relatively heavy starter motor, and they can get away with much smaller battery which is used more as a current stabilizer rather than storage.</p>

<p>As for regular automobiles, there are several factors that prevent manufacturers from using redundant starting systems:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>First of all, regular electric start is pretty reliable. All of us experience dead battery now and again, but mostly due to our own negligence. And in between, there are hundreds, if not thousands, starts the system handles without mechanical failure of the starter motor or natural degradation of the battery.</p></li>
<li><p>Secondly, although it is not high-performance racing application, the considerations of weight and cost still play an important role.</p></li>
<li><p>Modern cars use internal space rather efficiently, and there simply not many options to put another component, <strong>and</strong> have an easy access to it.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There are after-market systems allowing for that extra reliability for bigger utility vehicles like pick-ups for farmers or loggers and the like, but then again, that qualifies it as industrial application, because no one but Americans use those for getting to the office or snatching some milk in a neighbourhood shop.</p>

"Do fast cars need to occasionally be driven fast?","7051","","<p>In the broad spectrum of cars, there's higher end models with sport-focused engines.  Examples would be an BMW M3, and even more so Ferraris and Koenigseggs etc. Apparently they're more fussy, in that new cars need a careful run in, special oil, etc.</p>

<p>Given that they often have a huge swathe of torque, you can get away with minimal throttle and low RPMs for conservative road driving. Question is, is this ok?</p>

<p>I've heard that these cars ""need"" to be driven hard occasionally, i.e. an ""Italian tune-up"" and all that. Granted, there's the ulterior motive of actually using the car to its full potential. One owner wrote on a forum that after taking his BMW M5 to the track, the exhaust pipe was nicely cleaned out and it was a smoother drive on the way back.</p>

<p>Along with clearing out carbon build up from low temperature and low airflow usage, another issue might be optimal RPM for piston and head life. An engine might be so optimised for performance at 8,000 RPM, that driving it at 1,500 RPM long term, though very doable, could result in extra engine wear.</p>

<p>Is there any truth in that? Perhaps there are certain sports cars that do need this ""Italian"" treatment?</p>
","<p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> This is one of those questions where you are going to get a ton of opinion and speculation, and my reply will have some of that in it as well. </p>

<p>I think there is a lot of myth out there about what cars actually need to maintain them as they are and should be. For instance, your comment about the M5 owner. The entire statement is about seat of the pants performance check. It could be that the driver was very excited, still hyped on adrenalin, and it felt better to him because <em>he felt better</em>. On the other hand there is <em>some</em> basis of truth, depending on the driving habits of the individual involved. </p>

<p>It is good for any vehicle to be driven for an extended period of time. If the engine and components are not given a chance to warm up thoroughly, you'll find that carbon build-up and moisture will be left behind where you really don't want it to occur (in the oil and crank case most notably). Does this mean you need to once in a while drive the performance vehicle like a raped banshee to ""clean the carbon out""? Not at all. If the car is ran up to operating temperature on a regular basis (a minimum of once a month) and driven for a good set of miles (30+), you should have no issue with the car other than normal maintenance and should expect the vehicle to perform when you want it to perform.</p>

<p>Even if it were true, what would be the maintenance interval and specifications for an ""Italian Tuneup""? Do you roast the rear tires once a month? Twice a month? Is driving at 150mph what needs to happen? And for how long? What should you do to achieve this ""blowing out the carbon"" and getting your high performance sports car to a proper tune? I hope you see the problem with this, because there isn't any <em>correct</em> answer. It all comes from seat of the pants tuning, which isn't accurate, to say the least. People will tell you this must be done so as to give themselves a reason to drive their vehicle to the extreme of their vehicle's ability. This is one of the two reasons to have bought the vehicle in the first place (the other reason is for the bragging rights). Something you'll find, though, is owners of these higher performance vehicles are not content with ""normal driving"". It is way too easy and exhibits way too much fun to be able to drive such a car at the performance level it was designed. This is the reason you purchase something like this in the first place. <em>Most</em> owners of such vehicles will give it the <em>Italian Tuneup</em> on a regular basis, just because they can. </p>

<p>What it boils down to is this: Give me some empirical evidence an ""Italian Tuneup"" is needed to maintain the proper running of a vehicle and I'll believe it. Until then, I'll stick with what I know, which is, proper maintenance and regular driving is all you need and the vehicle, no matter what vehicle, will be just fine.</p>

<em><a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3AArbeitsweise_Zweitakt.gif"" rel=""noreferrer"">Source</a></em></p>

<p>It works like this:</p>

<p>While moving downwards after ignition, the piston exposes the exhaust opening, and the burned gas streams into the exhaust pipe like a (high pressure) shock wave. </p>

<p>Due to the inertia, this gas will create a slight vacuum wave behind it, which helps to suck out more burned gas, but also fresh gas as soon as the intake opening is uncovered.</p>

<p>The first cone helps to increase the vacuum: When the gas travels through the pipe with a certain speed, it travels through a certain volume per time. If the cross section is increased and the speed remains the same, the wave travels through a larger volume. This creates more ... uhm... vacuum volume behind the wave. It's a bit hard to explain.</p>

<p>OK, now we have fresh gas in the cylinder, but also in the manifold. 
The shock wave now hits the right cone and gets reflected. I.e. you now have a shock wave running towards the cylinder. It hits the fresh gas right in the moment when the intake opening is covered by the piston, and presses this gas into the cylinder. When the piston covers the exhaust opening, too, the fresh gas already is under some pressure.</p>

<p>This way, the exhaust forms some kind of compressor, increasing the volumetric efficiency / power of the motor.</p>

<p>The shape of the exhaust is very critical with respect to timing: The length of the pipe between exhaust opening and first cone defines when the amplified vacuum wave reaches the cylinder - it should be there when the intake openings are exposed and fresh gas can be sucked out of them. And the distance to the second cone defines when the reflected shockwave reaches the cylinder. Again: This should happen when the intake is already covered, and the exhaust is not yet. </p>

<p>This means the exhaust pipe is designed for a specific RPM, where you get the maximum gain in power. </p>

<p>However, the angles of the cones allow to broaden the RPM range where the motor develops its power, at the cost of maximum power.</p>

<p>For example, here are power / torque curves for three exhaust systems on the same scooter:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5GxUG.gif"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5GxUG.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>First, it's notable that the motor starts to develop some power right above 5000RPM because there the exhaust starts to work. </p>

<ul>
<li>The blue curve is a quite narrow peak with a maximum at 7700 RPM. it looses power quite rapidly for higher/lower RPMs. </li>
<li>The red curve is shifted to higher RPM, where it should develop more power - but instead, it's designed for a wider RPM range. So, the max. power is similar to that of the blue curve, but the RPM range is about twice as wide.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, the design depends on the needs of the vehicle, too. A motor cross bike usually has a transmission with several fixed gears and so runs over a wide RPM range. In contrast, scooters usually have a variomatic, which allows the motor to run on a certain, constant RPM.</p>

"2005 Chevy Cobalt won't start, sounds like a machine gun","7031","","<p>I haven't driven my car in about a week, and when I went to try and start it today, it would not start. It has enough battery to play the radio and whatnot, so I'm not sure if it's a battery related issue. </p>

<p>When I turn the key to start the car, the check engine light flashes as it's being turned, and the engine produces a sound similar to a machine gun.</p>

","<p>Definitely just insufficient current to run the starter motor. What happens (causing the flashing/clicking) is that when you turn the key, the starter relay/solenoid switches on, and the starter motor pulls all the available current, dropping the battery voltage extremely low. It can no longer power the relay, so the relay springs back and the load (starter motor) is removed from the battery, voltage returns to normal, and the whole cycle starts over again.</p>

<p>As for the root cause, it could just be a bad battery, or an accessory left on that drained your battery, or a weak/dead alternator that's not sufficiently recharging your battery when you drive the vehicle. But to get it started, a jump start or battery charger should suffice. Then you can begin tracking down the cause of the problem.</p>

"Briggs-Stratton Lawnmower motor losing power","7006","","<p>My Toro lawnmower featuring a Briggs-Stratton 7.25HP motor has been losing power lately. It is about 2 years old and I've used the maintenance kit (spark plug, air filter, oil, &amp; fuel treatment) to prep it at the start of each year. This year, it has really been struggling however. Typically, when I start it up, it oscillates between running strong and puttering out a few times before it's either ready to go or putters out completely. These symptoms have gotten progressively worse until it won't start at all.</p>

<p>I used a carb cleaner a few weeks ago, which really helped to get it going again but the problems came back a few weeks later and additional carb clearner doesn't seem to be helping anymore. This past weekend I bought another maintenance kit for it but it still won't start at all.</p>

<p>Any advice would be appreciated!</p>
","<p>This is a carburetor issue, most likely caused by ethanol gas. Ethanol laced gas reeks havoc upon small engines. The easiest fix for it is to purchase a new carburetor for it, due to paying the price for a replacement carb outweighs the cost in time and frustration which will be brought upon you trying to rebuild it. I have tried to rebuild small engine carbs in the past with only limited success. Besides the cost of the rebuild kit, you will still have to take your time to get it running, if it ever will. New ones are relatively cheap online and very easy to obtain, especially for B&amp;S engines. In the future use a product such as <a href=""http://www.walmart.com/ip/STA-BIL-22211-Fuel-Stabilizer-8-oz/16879745"" rel=""nofollow"">Sta-Bil</a> which will treat the gas and make it so it won't do this again. Sta-Bil is a gas stabilizer which will keep the gas usable for up to two years. Without it, the gas is only good for about 30 days. The way it works is by not allowing the ethanol to absorb moisture from the air. The ethanol/water mixture is what causes the carbs little orifices to plug up and is near impossible to clean out without extraordinary means.</p>

"What can cause excessive fog on a windshield?","7004","","<p>Recently there has been a lot of fog on all of the windows in the car, particularly on my windshield.  It's been bad enough that I've had to stop and wipe the glass off, but the fog can come back during a drive.  </p>

<p>What can cause all of this fog on the windshield?  What things can I try myself, before taking it to the shop?</p>

<p>I have a 2002 Subaru Forester.</p>
","<p>Typically the fog is from excessive humidity in the vehicle. The three most common sources I can think of are:</p>

<ul>
<li>A leak that allows rain water to collect in the car. Check to see if the rugs are damp, look in the storage well behind the seat and any place water might collect. </li>
<li>Do you also notice a sweet smell when the engine gets warm? If you do it may be a leaking heater core. Antifreeze could be leaking into the heater box then the vapor is fogging the windshield. Antifreeze residue can be difficult to remove from the windshield. Try rubbing a clean tissue on the inside of the glass. The tissue may show the oily component of the antifreeze.It may be a small leak as a little antifreeze goes along way in terms of fogging the glass. </li>
<li>The third source could be the A/C. The A/C unit removes humidity from the air. This is what causes the puddle under the car when the A/C is running. Sometimes the drain get clogged with leaves or pine needles. This allows the water to build up which adds humidity when you run the defroster. If enough has collected you may hear it sloshing under the dash when you make a turn. </li>

"Ford Focus 1.6 Petrol Timing Belt","6998","","<p>I brought a ford focus 1.6 04 plate with 154k on the clock (got it cheap!). It is up to 155k now had it about 3 months.</p>

<p>My mechanic advised me to change the timing belt and water pump asap which I will do as I trust his advice however I need to wait until I have the money.</p>

<p>I've been reading up quite a lot and the recommended mileage for this change is 100k, most people say get it changed between 70-80k to be safe. </p>

<p>Therefore in my head I'm thinking to make it to 155k without the belt snapping surely this means it must have been changed at some point or it would have gone already by now right?</p>

<p>So I guess my questions are: </p>

<p>Do you think the belt has been changed in its life (we have no history of the car)?
Is there any indication it could be on its way out (noises, vibrations, etc.)?
What am I expect if it does snap (how can I avoid crashing if it goes)?</p>

<p>Thanks in advanced!</p>
","<p>You can have a look at the condition of the belt to gauge its condition. But you'll need to have seen quite a number of timing belts to be able to tell.</p>

<p>The risk is that when a timing belt snaps, it damages your valves and pistons too. To fix that will require the engine be taken apart and the damaged parts replaced. It's not a cheap thing to do. Timing-belt related damage can cost anything from $1000 to $6000 depending on the car and the extent of the damage.</p>

<p>If you're worried about it, don't drive fast and don't rev your engine higher than needed. Keep it under 3500rpm. And try not to vary the RPM quickly. E.g. don't down shift suddenly and don't accelerate fast. Any time there's a sudden change in RPM, the timing belt experiences a shock, which could turn out to be the shock that finally snaps it. Smooth is the word.</p>

<p>Yesterday after five minutes of neighborhood driving, I accelerated after a right-turn-on-red (so accelerating a little heavily) and saw a great deal of white (maybe blue) smoke coming out of my tail pipe, and at the same time experienced a loss of acceleration (or perhaps my transmission shifted in a strange way, I'm not sure) then the smoke was thin (almost none) and the acceleration returned to normal. </p>

<p><strong>Why would I get a lot of smoke out of my car, and then the smoke goes away?</strong>
All of the issues I've read about do not seem like problems that would go away. </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
The mechanic replaced a PCV valve that was stuck open. An answer listing this as one of the possible causes and an explanation can get the bounty.</p>
","<p>Per your edit, you said the mechanic replaced a PCV valve that was stuck open, causing the excessive smoking. PCV in this case stands for Positive Crankcase Ventilation. The valve is located on the side of the engine block, and serves to vent excess pressure out of the crankcase. The pressure is created by the churning and heating of oil, as well as some of the combustion gasses escaping past the piston rings into the crankcase (known as blow-by).</p>

<p>Because the extra pressure in the crankcase often contains atomized oil and in some cases un-burnt fuel, the PCV valve routes these gasses back into the intake plenum, such that they can be used in the combustion cycle and exhausted out the tailpipe. When your PCV valve was stuck open, the hard acceleration excited and heated the oil, and the higher levels of blow-by caused by high engine RPM allowed (relatively) large amounts of that oil through the valve into the intake plenum, causing the white smoke you saw. It does not take much oil to create a large cloud of smoke, so you may not even notice the oil level went down if you were to check the dipstick. </p>

"What causes mechanical odometer to switch from miles to kilometers?","6977","","<p>My Dodge Avenger was made in 1996, and the odometer is currently showing 270K miles, just to give you a sense of the age of the vehicle. I've been getting suspiciously high mileage for at least the last year or so. The mileage app I'm using (<a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kajda.fuelio"" rel=""nofollow"">Fuelio</a>, highly recommended) says my average mpg is 43, and one fill-up recently my mileage was over 51 mpg.</p>

<p>So I finally used the <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.maps.mytracks"" rel=""nofollow"">My Tracks</a> app (which uses my phone's GPS) and compared its readings to my odometer. I did this several times, and it seems my odometer is consistently showing 1 mile for about every 0.61 actual miles I drive. For instance, on one trip my odometer showed 26.6 miles, and My Tracks said 16.2. At that ratio, my mileage is closer to 26 mpg, which sounds a lot more realistic for this car.</p>

<p>So what would be causing this odometer inaccuracy? Just about everything is stock, and I'm using the standard tire size.</p>

<p>I know this is a long shot, but any chance my odometer might actually be registering km instead of miles? The ratio is just about right (1 km = 0.62 mi). I have no idea why it would be doing that since it's a US vehicle. It's probably also relevant to mention it's a mechanical odometer, so it's not like I can press a button to switch between miles/km. I've done some googling, but I've only found <a href=""http://www.bimmerfest.com/forums/showthread.php?t=484089"" rel=""nofollow"">one similar instance</a>.</p>

<li>I purchased the car in a wrecked condition from a salvage yard and had it rebuilt</li>
<li>I'm fairly certain the odometer was registering miles when I first bought the car</li>
<li>To the best of my knowledge the instrument cluster was never changed</li>
<li>I was having an unrelated problem at one point and changed the ECU with one I bought from a salvage yard in the US. Replacing the new ECU with the original did not correct the issue.</li>
<li>The transmission was also rebuilt at one point</li>
</ul>
","<p>If your speedometer is accurate, you can check that with your GPS or phone as well. The only  real option is the cluster (The thing with all the gauges and odometer). You can send it off to have it repaired, or get a used one from a junk yard. If you ever sell the car you are legally bound in most (if not all) US states to tell the buyer of an odometer discrepancy. Just document the current mileage when you change the cluster and what the new cluster had when you installed it. If you get your current cluster repaired then I would just make a note of the mileage when you repaired it.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>Others have suggested that this normalish, but this is a major difference in mileage traveled vs mileage reported by the odometer, this is <strong>not</strong> a normal condition.</p>

<p>I do find it interesting that one mile = 0.621371 km, so if you speedo is correct and reading in mph, your odometer is measuring km. Now depending on where the car was manufactured the odometer may be in km and not miles. Do you have a switch to change from km to miles? Is the readout digital for the odometer?</p>

<p>The odometer is turned by a stepper motor which get's it's input from the PCM (Powertrain Control Module) which get's it's information from the VSS (vehicle speed sensor). The speedometer gets it's info from the PCM as well. So if the speedometer is showing you the correct speed then we know the VSS is sending the correct info to the PCM.</p>

<p>I see two possibilities</p>

<p>There is a problem with the PCM or PCM programing (software) that is causing the Odometer to read Km,  causing the computer is turning the stepper motor too fast.</p>

<p>The wrong stepper motor or gear in the cluster has been installed, either at the factory or when a repair was done. </p>

<p>Since you don't know if it was ever reading correctly you don't know if it's been that way from the factory, or if a repair prior to your ownership caused the problem. If it's been that way from the factory you car has considerably less miles on it that the odometer shows. Proving that is another problem entirely. </p>

"Why the wasted spark in four-stroke motors?","6968","","<p>This just came up in my curious mind. In a typical four-stroke engine with an even number of cylinders, spark plugs fire in pairs. This means there is a <strong>wasted spark</strong> as one cylinder is in exhaust, while the other actually fires at the top of compression.</p>

<p>I understand this is probably done to save space under the hood since it would double the number of required coil packs. It also saves money on initial purchase and replacement. However, they don't take up much space and don't cost that much (at least for my 4-cyl car).</p>

<p>My question: <strong>Why not double the number of coil packs to avoid the wasted spark?</strong> Though this would take up more space and cost more for the packs, surly it would reduce wear and tear on the spark plugs to some extent as well as the spark plug wires and perhaps the alternator. This would half the number of sparks on each plug since they could be set to only fire on a compression stroke.</p>

<p>I'm sure the space and cost considerations answers the question, but I was hoping for some other thoughts on the advantages/disadvantages of a system that avoids the wasted spark.</p>

<hr>

<p>Bonus question: Do two-cylinder engines typically spark both cylinders at the same time? Or do they tend to spark separately?</p>

<hr>

<p>Bonus question 2: Is there a wasted spark in engines with an odd number of cylinders? I wouldn't think so.</p>
","<p>I'm sorry if this ends up being a lengthy answer. The answer to this question is more historical than anything else but first a little background. </p>

<p>In a waste spark system an ignition coil has two spark plug outputs unlike every other system only having one. Each ignition coil is hooked up to two spark plugs. These spark plugs reside in two opposing cylinders, meaning the pistons move up and down at the same time. This puts one cylinder in the compression stroke and the other in the exhaust stroke at the same time. When the coil fires, both spark plugs spark at the same time, one in the cylinder with fuel and the other in the cylinder with exhaust. The spark in the cylinder with exhaust is called the waste spark. </p>

<p>When waste spark first came out it was on the cutting edge. It was an excellent replacement for a distributor but ultimately it was a compromise. The biggest reason for waste spark is that it required less computational power. Automotive computers were in their infancy at the time and just couldn't crunch the numbers to fire a set of individual coils. This is evident from the fact that at the same time multi point fuel injection systems were all the rage. The injectors were fired all together like one big injector unlike sequential fuel injection that followed that fired the injectors individually in the firing order. This is further evident from the use of ignition modules like in GM vehicles and EDIS in Ford vehicles. These modules performed some of the needed calculations to relieve the PCM from having to do them. </p>

<p>The wear and tear on the spark plugs you mention is over exaggerated because the waste plug always fires in the exhaust stream which is full of hot ionized gas that is really easy to fire through. In reality the spark plug that is firing backwards (side electrode to center electrode) incurres the most wear. </p>

<p>Most automotive manufacturers did eventually go to individual coils per cylinder, this is called coil on plug or coil near plug. It's a more advantageous system because dwell and timing can be controlled per individual cylinder. Even with the fact that they are so modern these systems still retain some the the roots of where they came from. For example in a Ford V8 engine with coil on plug, if the camshaft position sensor stops working the engine will use only the crankshaft position sensor and regress to using waste spark and firing the injectors in banks instead of sequentially. This is a drive me to a garage limp mode. Also some manufacturers still retain waste spark even on engine manufactured today. Take the GM Ecotec 4 cylinder engine for example, it still uses waste spark. </p>

<p>Finally your two cylinder question. It really depends on the design of the engine. if the cylinders are opposing like Vtwin engine then yes they use waste spark, but also these engines normally use a magneto system which always fires the same spark plug in the exhaust, it can't help it. If it's a flat engine like in some motorcycles then it does not use that system because the stroke of the cylinders is opposite. </p>

<p>P.S. odd number cylinder engines (greater than one that is) are so rare that it would be more of an exception that a rule as to what ignition systems they used.  </p>

<p>I didn't find this appropriate for the mathematics SE, so I posted it here.</p>

<p>thanks for the help.</p>
","<p>The only thing your car can sense is the number of turns of some part of the drive train. In the old days it was a gear right off the transmission, and today it's an electronic sensor in the transmission or somewhere in the drive train near the wheels. It's going to be a sensor that can determine how quickly the wheels are rotating.</p>

<p>The way to calculate  speed is the distance traveled divided by the time it took to travel that distance. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CeF8K.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CeF8K.gif"" alt=""Table of calculating speed as a function of time and distance""></a></p>

<p>The only thing that changes when you change the tire size is the distance traveled. So, for every revolution of the tire, you travel a distance equal to the circumference of the circle that is the tread of the tire. (Assuming the tire is not slipping).</p>

<p>The circumference (C) of the tire is calculated by C=2πr (2 times pi times the radius of the tire). So the distance from the center of the wheel to the outside edge of the tire, times 2, times pi (3.14159). Do this calculation for both the old and the new tire. </p>

<p>To get the percentage change in the speedometer, take the difference between the old and new distance, divide by the original distance, and multiply the result by 100. This will give you the percentage speed change from one tire to the next.</p>

<p>I hope that helps!</p>

<p>But first, I would check all the heat shielding on the car to make sure that's not a factor. When the transmission is engaged (when the clutch is not depressed) it can cause some NVH (noise, vibration, harshness) that will cause nearby heat shields to rattle and make it sound like a transmission problem. Once you've confirmed your Catalytic converter or exhaust heat shields are secured and/or not rattling, there are a few things that could be the case.</p>

<ul>
<li>Throwout Bearing Failure</li>
<li>Clutch release fork is loose/worn out/misadjusted</li>
<li>Clutch diaphragm springs damaged/worn/bent/loose</li>
<li>Clutch hub springs loose/worn/damaged/broken (I don't think the E39 has these but I wanted to cover this for other readers who may have the same question)</li>

It works by having the ability to close off one of the two intake ports near the intake valve at low engine speeds, which speeds up the air entering the cylinder and causes a swirl of the air fuel mixture as it enters. This produces better low end torque. Coupled with advanced exhaust gas recirculation allows for better gas mileage without engine misfires (from the extra exhaust gas). As the engine speeds up, the secondary port is opened. Here is an image of how the air flows into the engine with (left) and without (right) the port open:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/D6OJZ.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Since this should not affect high end horsepower output, I'd suggest the difference between the two engines is the compression ratio bump (10.1:1 vs 10.5:1 for the Twinport) and probably tuning. As a rule of thumb, every point of compression is worth approximately 3% change in horsepower, so that alone would not make up the 7% difference. </p>

"Why do manufacturers detune engines?","6924","","<p>I was wondering why a manufacturer would detune an engine. An example -- there are many others -- is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_OM612_engine"">Mercedes-Benz OM612 engine</a>. Same engine, lower (peak) power output in the Sprinter than in the E-class. The same hardware (and thus the same cost), yet they 'artificially' lower the power output and thus the specs they can use to sell the product.</p>

<p>Does it have to do with using the same engine for different purposes? With a van you probably want a different power and torque curve than with a sedan. In the example I gave, that seems to be the case, with the van reaching top power and top torque at a lower rpm than the sedan.</p>

<p>Or are there other reasons (fiscal, strategic,...) that lead to these decisions? Using the same example, in Belgium the engine was detuned whereas in other countries it was not (both for the same cars), as can be seen in the Wikipedia page. I live in Belgium but I have no idea why they would have done this for Belgium specifically. In this case, the only difference is the peak power output, the rpm at which this occurs and the max torque is still the same.</p>

<p>If non-design reasons are involved, would it (sometimes) make sense to tune these again to their 'normal' specifications?</p>
","<p>I'd be tempted to restate the question as <strong>""How do vehicle manufacturers decide what to tune for?""</strong> For the question as asked, there are a <strong>lot</strong> of possible reasons, and probably no way to know in a specific case unless somebody involved speaks up, but in general:</p>

<ul>
<li>To match the engine to a specific use case (as you suggested here).</li>
<li>To find a balance between performance, durability, and marketing needs (detune in Sprinter to improve reliability, tune in E-class for marketing/performance).</li>
<li>To fit into a particular regulatory class (in the US, for example regulations change with the load capacity of a vehicle).</li>
<li>To meet insurance requirements (horsepower limits for example).</li>
<li>To balance ""fleet"" requirements (another example from the US, makers are rewarded/penalized on maker's overall averages for fuel consumption and maybe for emissions as well, so tuning may get tweaked to manage this).</li>
<li>Maintaining or adjusting a product ""line"" – a maker may want to have a ""logical"" progression of features or performance and so adjust numbers to make this happen, or may be trying to move customers for strategic or economic reasons.</li>
</ul>

<p>For an operator of the vehicle it would seem that, after evaluating the ""good"" reasons for the tuning decisions, there would be no reason not to adjust the tuning to suit the operator's needs.</p>

"How to find and fix an oil leak on a Yamaha scooter","6920","","<p>Some months after I had my scooter serviced I noticed oil splotches under my bike everytime I left if for a while in the one spot. The company that serviced the bike did numerous things wrong including getting a cable stuck in the throttle assembly (since been fixed). So I suspect that something they did during the service has caused the oil leak. The whole bottom of the engine is now coated in oil.</p>

<p>Have a look:
<a href=""http://memecode.com/temp/scooter/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://memecode.com/temp/scooter/index.html</a></p>

<p>Said company won't obviously take responsibility for the leak and I'm a little short on cash, on top of that all the reputable companies in the area have waiting lists longer than a month.</p>

<p>So I'm up for attempting to fix it myself. The scooter is not worth a whole lot anymore, so I don't have that much to lose :-|</p>

<p>I heard from a friend that there is some sort of seal that has to be applied when the oil change is done? And if it's not changed you can get a slow leak like this? I've removed a lot of the panels so I can access the bike, but I can't see enough to know where the leak is.</p>

<p>Help?</p>

<p>Update: The engine has been degreased and the leak is between the cylinder block and the crank case. And that seems like it's just too hard for me to attempt at this point. And probably too expensive to pay someone else to do as well. I might have to put up with just filling it up with oil in the meantime.</p>
","<p>First thing you should do is get the engine nice and clean using some good quality degreaser, a brush and a hose to wash it down, this will make identifying the leak much easier. </p>

<p>After everything is nice and clean take the scooter for a 10 minute ride, then have a another look. This time it should be much easier identifying the source of the leak.</p>

<p>Most likely your friend meant the sealing washer on the sump plug. This should be replaced whenever the oil is changed to ensure a good seal. I would also check to make sure the sump plug and the oil filter have been tightened correctly. Either of these could be the source of your leak.</p>

<p>While your at it you might want to add some oil to your engine. By the looks of those photos it's leaking quite a bit of oil.</p>

"What makes two-stroke engines less fuel-efficient than four-strokes?","6913","","<p>It is a commonly-held belief that two-stroke engines are less fuel-efficient than four-stroke engines, and <a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/a/25022/675"">some example BSFC figures</a> appear to confirm this as well.</p>

<p>But what is it that causes two-strokes to be less fuel-efficient?</p>

<p>I used to believe that it is due to the fact that the intake stroke occurs once per two revolutions in a four-stroke engine, in contrast to the once-per-revolution of a two-stroke engine, but am not so sure now.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.evinrudenation.com/reviews/the-fuel-duel-are-4-strokes-more-efficient-than-2-strokes/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This Evinrude article</a> suggests that the difference in fuel efficient is down to the method of fuel delivery, so the differences in fuel economy is due to an unfair comparison of older two-strokes with newer four-strokes.</p>

<p>So what factors would explain the differences in fuel economy between the two types of engines?</p>
","<p>Just so we're on the same page as to how two strokes work, here's a pic. I had to look it up because I had the wrong picture in my head.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/V7bxM.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/V7bxM.gif"" alt=""Two Stroke Motor Anatomy""></a></p>

<p>In looking at how the cycle actually works, the power stroke goes off creating the combustion products and power. As the downstroke begins the pressure in the cylinder is high allowing the exhaust gases to escape and forcing the intake reed valve closed. As the upstroke happens the pressure in the cylinder is now low because the escaping exhaust gases cause a small pressure wave of escaping gas that now opens the reed value and draws in new fuel / air mixture.
<br><br>
It seems like some key reasons for the engine being inefficient:</p>

<ul>
<li>The cylinders are not scavenged of exhaust gases by the piston forcing them out, they simply escape because the outside air pressure is lower than the cylinder pressure after the spark ignites the fuel. This would lead to incomplete expulsion of the exhaust gases. The volume consumed by those leftover gases prevent more air / fuel mix from being ingested.</li>
<li>As the upstroke happens, for some part of the travel the air / fuel mix is also being expelled. Thus wasting fuel as it's expelled.
<br><br>
Maybe these problems are solved in larger two strokes but the small ones drive things like weed cutters, snow blowers, lawn mowers, etc, small engines for limited applications. Not driving cross country. For these small engines parts count and cost are much more important, so they work really well for those applications.</li>

"Why doesn't my rev limiter bounce?","6901","","<p>I have a BMW 630i Steptronic from 2007.</p>

<p>If I floor the pedal in neutral the RPM is of course limited, but it doesn't ""bounce"" like regular rev limiters. Instead it keeps a constant and ""clean"" RPM.</p>

<p>My old Audi A6 Multitronic 2008 did the exact same thing.</p>

<p>What changed from the old ""dancing"" rev limiters to this type?</p>
","<p>Traditional rev limiters work by controlling the ignition and/or fuel.    </p>

<p><strong>Ignition Control</strong>   </p>

<ul>
<li>Retarding the spark  (smoother)</li>
<li>Completely cutting the spark  (more aggressive)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Fuel Control</strong> - Amount of fuel thrown in is controlled. This is used very carefully as effects of running lean at such high RPM can be detrimental to the engine health. In fact, lot of controllers completely shy away from it for good reason.  </p>

<p><strong>Cylinder Control</strong> - Allows for one more parameter to play with to smooth-en out the total power produced.</p>

<h1>Control Strategy</h1>

<p>For the sake of categorizing, the above parameters are controlled to achieve the desired output</p>

<ul>
<li>Hard Cut - With hard cut, the power is abruptly reduced once it reaches the SET RPM </li>
<li>Soft Cut - power is progressively reduced as it approaches the set RPM  </li>
</ul>

<p>The above was a crude generalization while the actual strategy employed could be thought of as a fader between the above two.  </p>

<p>While revving in nuetral/clutched - There is very little rotational inertia and so as the rev's reach the SET limit soft control becomes less effective and hard-cut is initiated to the rev's within range. This causes the rev's to <em>bounce off the limit</em> repeatedly.<br>
While in gear - as the vehicle approaches the rev-limit, the above mentioned <em>bounce</em> is lesser. One will still <em>feel</em> the limiter.<br>
For passenger cars the limiter is a lot softer and smoother at the expense of losing power.<br>
For race cars, the all or nothing approach works well (wouldn't want to compromise power) and consequently (almost as a side-effect) works as a quick feedback that the limit is reached.</p>

<p>Rev- limiters are also used for launch control, flatshifting (multistage limiters) and for antilag  </p>

<p>Launch Control  - Engine RPM is held at a particular RPM which is optimum for launching (right balance point between RPM, torque, wheelspin etc.) </p>

<p>Flatshifting - Allows for the driver to keep his leg floored while the limiter automatically brings the revs to optimum RPM for the shift. </p>

<p>Anti-Lag for turbo - By using ignition retard + fuel control allows for hotter exhaust gases at the set RPM which helps reduce turbo lag (between gear-shifts and during launch). An extreme setting for the same causes backfires and the loud pops commonly heard in race cars with massive turbos.   </p>

<p><strong>DBW Systems</strong> allow for complete control of the throttle body and makes for a more accurate and smoother control. Depending on the strategy and setting, it has the option of pre-emptively reducing the throttle response as it approaches the limit to control the offshoot. And even when it does, the ability to choke the engine allows for engine braking control. So we're not just letting the engine slow down by cutting power, we have brakes to some extent.<br>
So, in a way , the traditional system is <em>reactionary</em> while DBW is <em>active</em> , in some sense at least. </p>

"Why is cold-start fuel mixture enrichment necessary?","6888","","<p>I know a rich mixture is more fuel added than air in the ratio required (14.7:1), but how can it affect anything?</p>

<p>I mean, if fuel is added but with no air it can't combust, so how can that affect the ease of starting an engine when cold?</p>

<p>Since it isn't burning fuel inside, does it evaporate and expand? Or what happens?</p>
","<p>There are two issues with cold fuel:</p>

<ul>
<li>cold fuel is harder to vaporize (as <a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/a/21453/675"">HandyHowie mentions</a>)</li>
<li>cold fuel is likely to condense on cold engine parts, making its burning harder, less predictable</li>
</ul>

<p>So more fuel is added than necessary - using a richer AFR - in anticipation that a decent proportion of fuel will not be burned. In other words, during cold starts the <em>effective</em> AFR is leaner than expected, so the mixture is enriched to compensate for that</p>

<p>The excess unburnt fuel is usually burnt through the addition of extra air (often called secondary air) in the exhaust, where the temperature of the combustion in the cylinder is sufficient to allow any fuel that remains in the exhaust gases to burn before reaching the catalytic converter.</p>

<hr>

<p>To quote the Bosch Fuel Injection &amp; Engine Management book:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Gasoline is less likely to vaporize when it is cold. Even if it is
  adequately vaporized, some fuel condenses on the cold parts of the
  engine before it can be burned. The engine requires extra fuel for
  starting so that, in spite of vaporization and condensation problems,
  the engine still receives a combustible air-fuel mixture.</p>

","<p>If you can get some penetrating lube similar to what you would on rusty bolts spray the offening link. This should help but only if the stiff link is due to rust or lack of lubrication. If the link was damaged it won't get better. In the U.S. we have Liquid wrench,SeaFoam, PB Blaster etc. you want something that is thin enough to seep between the plates. If you can soak a small rag with the penetrant and wrap it around the chain overnight. Then see if you can work the link in both direction by hand. Most of the aerosols will evaporate so the rag gives you a longer soak. If the link frees up spray it with a chain lubricant so it will stay flexible. </p>

","<p>If I were you, I'd just do it right and be done with it. Don't feel bad about the peeling paint as all of the Dodge/Chrysler products of the era did the same thing (GM had a phase of this as well ... I would bet Ford had its problems in this area to boot). The problem was (from my understanding) when manufacturers were required to go to water based paint to reduce volatile organic compounds (<a href=""http://msdssearch.dow.com/PublishedLiteratureDOWCOM/dh_0033/0901b803800334e7.pdf?filepath=oxysolvents/pdfs/noreg/110-00892.pdf&amp;fromPage=GetDoc"" rel=""noreferrer"">VOCs</a>). The primer at that time wasn't up to the task of keeping paint adhered to the surface of the vehicle and so, after a few years of baking in the sun, it lets loose and vehicles start looking like yours.</p>

<p>With that said, I would just sand down the rust areas, use some sealer/primer, then follow with rattle cans of your color of paint. You can go to most any place which does automotive paints and get paint made for your color of vehicle put into rattle cans. This is a <em>very common occurrence</em>. The rust which is on your vehicle now is just minor surface rust. It shouldn't take too much elbow grease to get it completely removed from the vehicle. </p>

<p>As for rust converter. If you do decide to go that route, realize that it usually goes on thick. It will not want to lay very flat on the vehicle, so your aesthetics portion will go out the window. It will do a great job of converting the rust, but the finish will suck. Secondly, it takes a beating from UV light, which will make it degrade over time. If you are going this route, you need to cover it with the final color in order for it to survive as well as at least make it look like some semblance of normal. </p>

<p>The reason I am asking this is because the AirBag light is on. My car does not give any codes on dashboard by blinking a code - it is solid red. I also went to Chevrolet dealership who supposedly should have had the right reader to get SRS codes, however, they said that they did not see any codes that are directly related with AirBag even though AirBag light was on when I brought car. Instead they recommended to replace battery because it is still the original one from 2007. However, I did not fully buy into that idea, because car starts completely normally.</p>

<p>So, I feel that I want to figure this AirBag issue on my own now. After disconnecting battery and waiting 20 minutes I cleaned those 2 thick cable connectors of possible rust with WD-40, but it did not help. So I am trying to figure out if there are any other low hanging fruits I can do at home.</p>
","<p>The plain white connector with two wires, black and brown with a white stripe, go to a switch in the seat belt buckle. This turns off the warning light on the dash.</p>

<p>The yellow connector is for the side impact airbag inflator located in the outer seatback side bolster.  These wires are carefully protected and colored yellow to let all who see then to work with caution. Do not touch this system without understanding and following all the manufactures cautions.</p>

<p>On this model there is an optional device in the passenger seat to detect if there is a person in that seat. That is the second yellow wire under the passenger seat.  </p>

<p>--- Update ---</p>

<p>You mentioned in your updated post that the SRS dash warning light is on but no with codes stored in the unit. The most common cause of this is a failure inside the SRS control unit. There is no way I know of to test for it except to substitute a known good unit. It is possible but unlikely that the cause is in the inflator circuits.  A short to ground on the wire from the SRS light to the control unit can cause this.</p>

<p>These control units are usually designed to so that the will not reset if the battery is disconnected; for liability reasons. An appropriate scan tool is needed. This is the first thing I would do when testing this system.</p>

<p>A low battery voltage can cause SRS codes but these should clear with an appropriate scan tool command. The voltage can go too low during cranking even without a driver perception of the problem. The voltage should stay above 10 volts at all times during engine crank.</p>

<p>I do not recommend working on this system. One wrong move could result in serious injury. Even those trained on these systems are wary of them.</p>

<li>Having dedicated summer and winter tires means you maximize your traction during the different seasons. No need to <a href=""http://www.edmunds.com/car-reviews/features/tire-test-all-season-vs-snow-vs-summer.html"" rel=""nofollow"">compromise on traction and conditions with all-season tires</a>. This is easily the most important factor.</li>
<li>Allows you to use the wheels you favor during the summer where the conditions are less harsh.</li>
<li>Wheel and tire fitments that better target winter conditions. Typically, narrowing your winter tires will improve traction. Going with a smaller diameter wheel and increasing the sidewall of your tire will also improve ride quality as your tire is now a larger cushion from pothole-filled roads and the extra sidewall height provides more protection to the rim from pothole strikes that you may inadvertently hit. Most who go with a smaller/narrower wheel usually just step down 1 inch in diameter and 10mm in width. Just make sure that going with smaller diameter wheels will still clear your brakes!</li>
<li>Both sets of tires will last longer since tread wear is split across both sets.</li>
<li>Winter traction on the winter tires will last for more miles than all-season tires, which must compromise on winter traction to also allow for decent wet/dry traction.</li>
</ul>

<p>Drawbacks of a dual set-up:</p>

<ul>
<li>Up-front price.* You need to buy a second set of rims and a second set of tires for the conditions you are targeting (presumably, that would be winter tires). You'll also need a jack** to lift the car so you can swap the wheels, or pay someone to do it for you. This tends to be the primary reason people often stick with running just all-season tires year round.</li>
<li>Storage. You need to store the wheel set you aren't currently using.</li>
<li>Indecision on matching the tires and conditions. Summer and winter tires have recommended operating ranges for temperatures and conditions. Particular seasonal conditions can put you in a tough spot on which set you should use. What do you do if it's been 50 degrees and sunny and then the forecast calls for 3 days of low 30's and a little snow? At what point in the year do you decide to make the change?</li>
<li>Traveling from a location with ideal conditions to another location with potentially inclement weather. For example, if you live in an area that generally sees nice weather and you wish to travel into some mountains where snow is likely, which set do you utilize?</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, it should be noted some of the cons can be mitigated simply through experience, so the impact of some of them can range from fairly minor to non-existent. Again, that depends on your situation and your location/climate.</p>

<hr>

<p>*It is up-front because once you've purchased the wheels, they should last until you decide you don't need them anymore. Purchasing the winter tires will, eventually, even out long-term since you are now splitting tire wear across two different sets of tires over the course of a year.</p>

<p>**I do not recommend using the emergency jack. It is not intended to be used regularly. Getting a proper floor jack with a lift capacity that comfortably covers your needs is highly recommended. For example, I tend to lift the entire front or entire rear of my Subaru Legacy at one time, so my jack's capacity covers more than 50% of my car's total weight.</p>

","<p>That is the part of the odometer called the <em>Trip Odometer</em>. There should be a button you can push to cycle through the different settings very near the reading, usually in the dash. You can usually press and hold the button to allow for a reset. Since it shows an [A] on it, you can expect there is probably a second one named [B] (at a minimum). If you cycle through far enough, you'll get back to your regular mileage reading. You probably pressed the button accidentally and caused it to get to the trip reading.</p>

"When idling, AC does not work and engine overheats. What's the cause?","6776","","<p>I drive a 2013 Chevy Sonic.</p>

<p>Basically, the air conditioning does not blow cold air if the car is idling, only when in motion. It seems to blow the coldest during long periods of driving fast, such as on the freeway. Once I have slowed down significantly or stopped, the air blowing out gets warmer and warmer. If I leave the AC on cold long enough (more than about five minutes) while staying slow enough (idling or driving >10mph during heavy traffic), then the engine overheating warning appears on my dashboard:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eD32m.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eD32m.png"" alt=""temp warning""></a></p>

<p>When this happens, I stop, open the windows, and turn on the heat to max. This typically makes the warning go away quickly, within 20-30 seconds. The warning will not come back unless I return to idling with the cold AC on. This has happened at least half a dozen times in the past year, so I typically just turn the AC off when going slow to avoid it.</p>

<p>The first time it overheated I refilled the coolant, but that didn't end up having any noticable effect.</p>

<p>Is there anything I can check on to try to figure out the source of this problem? Is it something urgent that I should get checked out right away?</p>

"What is the point of the exhaust?","6774","","<p>I was thinking today, what is the actual point of an exhaust? </p>

<p>Why can't we just have a pipe going out the front of a car instead of taking all the gases to the back of the car?</p>

<p>I can only see disadvantages of the current design:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The expense of manufacturing a long metal pipe, which has to be the length of the car. It would be a lot cheaper to make it come out at the front or the side</p></li>
<li><p>More to repair. Loads of old cars have leaking exhausts, and are always a nightmare to find and are expensive to fix. It would be easier to move the exhaust to the side or front and shorten it</p></li>

<p>Why can't we just let the gases out into the engine compartment, or out the front or side of the engine?</p>

<p>If we can't let them into the engine compartment, why can't we just let it out at the side of the car, instead of at the back?</p>
","<p>Safety, comfort, noise and space are the things that come to mind.</p>

<h2>Safety</h2>

<p>Exhaust gasses are hot as hell.  Hot enough that we put heat shields all over the exhaust line.  In engines, we are actively trying to remove heat.  Adding more from the exhaust goes completely against that and would increase overheating.  Also, would you want a hot exhaust pipe near your door, nicely exposed for you to brush a leg against when getting out?  I don't.</p>

<h2>Comfort</h2>

<p>If the exhaust came out the front or the side, you would be far more likely to breathe in your own exhaust, either through an open window or the ventilation system.  No thanks.</p>

<h2>Noise</h2>

<p>We need to put a muffler somewhere.  The space near the engine is already being used pretty heavily.  So you would either have to design something smaller or live without one.  Since there are laws some places regarding having a muffler and creating excess noise, car manufacturers are going to put them on there so they can sell cars.</p>

<h2>Space</h2>

<p>As alluded to above, there are large components (muffler, catalytic converter) that need to go somewhere.  And they don't fit up by the engine.</p>

"What are the dangers of refilling your air conditioner yourself?","6758","","<p>Both of the Haynes manuals for my cars list refilling the refrigerant in your car as a do it yourself procedure.  Both vehicles use R-134a refrigerant and the manual shows them being recharged with a simple hose without a pressure gauge on it.</p>

<p>I also watched the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHg2xRMnM38"">ChrisFix video</a> on recharging your A/C refrigerant, which makes it look simple, safe and easy.  The <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B007USCM7E"">product he uses in the video</a> comes with a pressure gauge and contains sealant.</p>

<p>However, when I started reading the many <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B007USCM7E"">one star reviews</a>, things didn't look so simple or safe.  Many people destroyed their compressors, by either overfilling or by the sealant clogging their compressors.</p>

<p>Quoting one reviewer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have spoken to a couple of different shops and both have said they see person after person come in with issues from these home kits. They don't show the amount that goes in, just the pressure in the system. Well that isn't nearly enough information since <strong>the weight is what is important</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and another one:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don't use this unless you have professional gauges. You can likely borrow them (appropriate gauges) from Auto Zone or equivalent. Or, just do what I eventually did, take it to Jiffy Lube (or equivalent) and let them remove all the refrigerant and refill to factory specs.</p>

<p>The most common DIY problem is overfilling oil, under or overcharging refrigerant and installing the virus that are sealants. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What equipment do I need to do it safely?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gloves and safety glasses. The PAG oil used is not good for humans and the gas can cause frostbite.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What issues are there with sealants?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sealants rarely work well if at all. They can plug critical parts such as expansion devices or heat exchangers. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should I get a refill that contains compressor oil?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, the oil amount is set during build and it impossible to know how much is might have been lost. Overfilling reduces system performance and under filling will destroy the compressor.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Would I be better off just paying a shop to do it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes</p>

<p>There are two key issues that make this a non-DIY job. A high vacuum must be pulled on the system to ensure that every last bit of air is out. And the refrigerant must be carefully weighed during installation. A few ounces over or under can significantly affect system performance. The DIY install systems only show one of the available pressure readings and in any case charge amount cannot be determined from pressure readings.</p>

"Does engine braking an automatic wear out the transmission?","6754","","<p>My question is a variation on these two:</p>

<li><a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/q/29291/17126"">What are the “1” and “2” or “L” gears used for on an automatic?</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I recently bought an automatic transmission 2012 Mazda 3 after driving a manual for a number of years. As was my habit with the manual, rather than braking on a highway off-ramp, I downshift all the way to 1 to use engine braking (applying brakes right at the end).</p>

<p>When downshifting from 2 to 1 around 30 - 40 km/h the car has a jerk of deceleration and revs to about 4k rpm. I assume this is because a large amount of momentum is transferred through the transmission to the engine block while the clutch is engaging. Is this putting strain or wear on the transmission?</p>

<p><strong>Am I saving wear-and-tear on my brakes at the cost of an eventual transmission replacement?</strong></p>
","<p>Sorry for bringing up an old thread, but I'd just like to add my personal experience with this.  Long story short, I recently took up the practice of engine braking on an automatic minivan, and my transmission is now dead at 100k miles.  Could just be a coincidence, but here's the long story for what it's worth:</p>

<p>On a drive up and down the Rockies a bit, 1 year ago, I decided to try engine braking while heading down hills.  We're talking about 40-50 mph in 4th gear (the gear just below my OD) and 30-40 mph in 3rd.  3k rpms max, usually closer to 2k.  After about 1.5 hrs of doing this on the way back, I noticed a whirring sound.  It worried me, but after getting home and checking the transmission fluid, everything seemed fine.  I figured I was just being paranoid, that the sound had already been there and that I was just worried that after trying this new thing I was prone to think I did something wrong.  But...</p>

<p>After about a year of frequently doing this, not just in the mountains, but at red lights, etc., the 3rd gear suddenly now has a terrible time shifting.  And 4th seems like it's about to go as well.  The transmission mechanic says the fluid looked fine and everything else is checking out.  My ""clutches"" are going out, he says.  Time for a transmission rebuild.</p>

<p>I'm sure it's not that rare for a 10 year old transmission with 100k miles to go out all of a sudden, but I can't help but think that it was the engine braking that made it happen so soon.  Whether or not the whirring sound was already there will remain a mystery, but I'm fairly certain it wasn't.  I don't want to build unfounded fear for engine braking, but the saying ""better to wear out a $150 part than a $3000 part"" is really hitting close for me.</p>

"Is 15V too high for a standard car battery?","6718","","<p>Today I let my car battery charger charge a car battery over about 8 hours and probed the voltage to be about 15V with still 2 amps being pumped through by the charger (though the current was slowly falling over time) Is the battery damaged? The charger is a standard one designated for car batteries not an improvised one.</p>
","<p>I take it that the ""car battery charger"" you mention in your post is an old-school type, which does not have any built-in charge regulation?</p>

<p>If it's taken your battery up to 15 volts, and it's a modern, regulated charger, it appears to me to be faulty. After 8 hours, no self-respecting modern charger should still be charging at 15 volts.  If it's old school, this is pretty normal, and it's time to stop charging.</p>

<p>So, to answer your question, Yes, 15 volts is too high. Most car alternators, that normally recharge your battery after every start, and provide power while the engine is running, are normally voltage regulated to about 13.8 to 14.0 volts. Up to this voltage and at normal temperatures, the battery will only gas very slightly. Above this, and it will gas increasingly with increasing voltage. This will damage your plates by causing flaking of plate material and shortening your battery's life. Gassing is undesirable.</p>

<p>Note, by gassing, I don't mean boiling. Gassing is the breakdown (electrolysis) of water (H2O) in the electrolyte into H2 gas and O2 gas. This  happens when the plates cannot accept any more charge (I.e. there is no PbSO4 left to be converted, meaning the plates are fully charged) if the voltage goes too high. A regulated charger will hold the voltage to 13.5 to 13.8 volts once the voltage has peaked, to prevent gassing and overcharging, and the current will drop to almost zero in a healthy battery. Gassing due to overcharging also ""uses up"" the water in your electrolyte, and in sealed batteries will fairly soon ruin the battery.  You may have also noticed that the battery started to get warm/hot. This is another sign of overcharging, and is also damaging to the battery due to expansion and warping of the plates.</p>

<p>CAUTION: This gas is a highly explosive mixture, so be very careful not to create any sparks near the battery while gassing continues, or for a while afterwards. Battery explosions are very nasty and dangerous. You'll get debris and acid flying in all directions. </p>

<p>I can't answer as to whether the battery will have been damaged. If it got hot, it may have been. If the electrolyte level has gone down, it will need to be topped up with distilled water. About 10-12mm (1/2 inch) above the top of the plates is about typical, but wait until gassing has stopped, then rock the battery back and forth a few times to release any gas bubbles from the plates first. </p>

<p>To find out about the state of your battery, either get it tested, or put it back in the car and see how it goes.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

","<p>The lower the gear, the better the job the engine compression will do at holding the car if the brake fails, that's because a lower gear makes the engine spin faster and requires it to do more work for the car to move. So 1st is better than 2nd, between reverse and 1st it's not so obvious – but from the examples people are finding it looks like 1st is a bit better.</p>

"If the check engine light goes off after some time later, has the issue been resolved?","6669","","<p>My '08 Ford Fusion's check engine light went on about a month ago. It was a P0455 code ""Evaporative emission control system leak detected - large leak"". I was going to fix it myself, but never got around to ordering the part. Anyway, the light had gone off last week and now I'm wondering if it is even an issue any more?</p>
","<p>With some variation based on model year and country of use most faults will latch and self clear. By latching the fault, it is stored and in some cases the ""check engine light"" also referred to as the MIL (malfunction indicator light)  will remain lit after repair until certain conditions are met. The conditions for the fault to clear may involve a certain number of miles driven, cold start cycles completed or passed self tests. As @ Nathan Liddle has stated your fault points to the gas cap as the most likely culprit. If you repaired the fault the MIL may stay lit until the fault self clears. Even after the fault clears it will remain stored for a certain amount of time which also varies with model year,etc. This is useful for diagnosing MIL issues that can come and go like vacuum leaks, bad connections and misfires.  </p>

"How can I identify which cylinder is responsible for a petrol engine misfire?","6654","","<p>My petrol engine has developed a persistent misfire. How can I figure out which cylinder is the culprit in order to hone in on the root cause?</p>
","<p>It is easy to tell a misfiring engine as it will transmit unusual vibrations that vary in severity with engine load. A misfire occurs when a cylinder fails to ignite the air/fuel mixture at the right time and could happen due to a wide range of reasons, including lack of spark (a bad coil), lack of fuel delivery (clogged fuel injectors) and improper ignition timing (out-of-spec cam timing).</p>

<p>There are several ways to identify the cylinder(s) responsible for the misfire:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Use a code scanner</strong>. Most modern-day vehicles come with an engine control unit (ECU). One of the jobs of the ECU is to store engine faults, and infers the misfiring cylinder based on the readings coming from the engine knock sensors. While this approach is quick and easy, it is not always guaranteed to register the responsible cylinder.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Infer by elimination</strong>. The principle behind this approach is quite simple - if a firing cylinder is disabled while the engine is running the vibration ""signature"" will change, while if a misfiring cylinder is disabled then there will be no discernible change in engine note. This test is best done with the engine running and with appropriate PPE as it will invariably involve disconnecting coils/plug wires one-by-one. After each cylinder is tested, the coil/plug wiring should be reconnected to restore the engine note back to its baseline.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Observe the thermal signature</strong>. A misfiring cylinder will not generate the same level of heat as a firing cylinder. This test is best suited to engines with easy-to-access exhaust headers. With the engine cold, start it up and let it run for a few seconds before turning it off. By figuring out which parts of the exhaust header(s) are cold (an IR temperature gauge should work well here), one can hone in on the misfiring cylinder. This test doesn't work well if the engine is run for too long as the heat generated will even out across the headers.</p></li>

"Non-functional gas pedal, engine stalling, dead battery: broken alternator?","6647","","<p>I have a 2005 Nissan Sentra. The following happened twice within a few days:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I stopped at a red light. When the light turned green, pressing the gas pedal had no effect at all. However, the car would still move forward at idling speed while in drive (about 3-4 km/h), regardless of the pedal.</p></li>
<li><p>If I put the car in neutral and pressed the gas pedal, the engine would rev normally. Putting it back in first, second or drive would again make the gas pedal non-functional. I can floor it with no effect, as if the pedal was disconnected. I think I was hearing a whine with a pitch proportional to the depth of the pedal, but I'm not sure.</p></li>
<li><p>The first occurrence was at the end of a 30 minute drive. I drove like this for several minutes (I was close to my destination), at which point the problem disappeared: I pressed the gas pedal and the engine responded normally.</p></li>
<li><p>The second occurrence was two or three minutes after starting a drive. I pulled over and put the car in park. A few seconds later, the airbag light came on, followed by the engine oil light. Both flickered wildly for a while, after which the engine stalled. I attempted to restart it several times, but it behaved as if the battery was dead: it would turn once or twice without starting, then eventually just a clicking sound.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>At that point, I left the car there overnight and called a tow truck the next day. While waiting for the towing I started the car several times without problems and was able to drive it successfully in a parking lot.</p>

<p>I then put it in park, turned on the lights, heating and radio (anything that used electricity), waited a minute, turned off the engine and unsuccessfully attempted to restart it. It had the same symptoms as before: a few turns without starting, then clicking sounds.</p>

<p>The tow truck guy checked a few things before towing the car:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>He jump started the car successfully. While in park, the gas pedal would behave normally and rev up the engine.</p></li>
<li><p>He unhooked the jump starter while the engine was running. At that point, the RPM needle on the dashboard went down to 0 even though the engine still seemed to be running (albeit very slowly, but without stalling). The gas pedal became non-functional.</p></li>
<li><p>He measured a relatively stable ~7.10 volts on the battery.</p></li>
<li><p>He hooked back the jump starter and the RPM and gas pedal went back to normal.</p></li>

<p>(Note:  The car smells poor because it's somewhat unclean, but there is a very distinct and very strong bad smell from the vents whenever the air is turned on.  The smell comes from both the A/C and heat.)</p>

<p>Go looking for places where you can rig up a filter to substitute for the lack of another.  I wouldn't think of this as a permanent fixture - just something to reduce the spore count.<br>
For example, our local big hardware store sells HEPA furnace filters for fairly cheap.  Those are easily cut to whatever size seems appropriate.  You can affix a square of filter material to the outside of the air conditioning recirculation intake using duct tape, if nothing else.  </p>

<p>Clearly, that would be a bit ghetto.  Still, you would be pulling the air through a filter and that <em>will</em> reduce the spore count over time.</p>

"Why can't I ride a new motorcycle too fast?","6628","","<p>I bought a new motorcycle. The manual says that for the first 500km, I should not twist the throttle more than half. </p>

<p>And for the first 1800km, should not twist it more than 75%. </p>

<p>Why can't I use full throttle?</p>
","<p>It's my understanding with the current manufacturing technology it's not necessary anymore, on new cars, now there may be differences in motorcycle engines as I am not as familiar with those. With that being said we ask the customer to come back in 500 - 1000 miles for a free oil change on the engines we build and install. We do this for a couple of reasons, we change the oil getting any of the contaminates that may have been the result of the rebuild and break in, it also allows us a chance to double check our work and make fine tuning adjustments. </p>

<p>Here is a related excerpt from a popular mechanics article </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ritual of breaking in a new car is part of the body of knowledge
  we refer to as conventional wisdom. It’s not necessarily wise, and the
  technology of building a modern automobile has evolved to the point
  where a lot of “wisdom” is obsolete. Few cars specify a break-in
  procedure anymore, simply cautioning you to avoid extreme acceleration
  or extended idling for the first thousand miles or so, and there’s
  little in the way of extra service up front.</p>
  
  <h2>Engine Cylinder Walls</h2>
  
  <p>Piston rings don’t rely on their spring tension to seal against the
  cylinder bores. Instead, combustion gases work their way between the
  rings and the piston and force the rings outward. During the first few
  minutes of engine operation, it’s important that the throttle be
  opened pretty far at lower rpms to provide this high pressure.
  Otherwise, the rings won’t burnish the cylinder walls properly, and
  the engine will have high volumes of blow-by—which means excessive oil
  consumption and shortened engine life. If you’ve ever seen the car
  jockeys who drive new cars off the end of the production line into the
  storage lot, or the transporter drivers zipping up and down the
  car-hauler ramps, you’ll realize that this all-important step has been
  performed for you many times. If you’re installing a new engine,
  simply give it a few seconds of wide-open throttle in a high gear. For
  the first thousand miles, avoid constant speeds and throttle settings.
  If you commute in normal stop-and-go traffic, you’ll be fine. I advise
  against cruise-controlled sojourns across Nebraska.</p>
  
  <h2>Bearings</h2>
  
  <p>The admonition to keep engine revs low for an extended break-in period
  stems from the days when bearing and crankshaft manufacturing
  tolerances were far less rigorous and lubricating oil wasn’t nearly as
  good. While modern engines are assembled to much the same design
  clearances, the tolerances are much tighter, meaning the variability
  is smaller, greatly reducing the possibility of a tight spot.
  Redlining a fresh motor is generally a bad idea, but there’s no reason
  you shouldn’t drive normally. I would, however, avoid top-speed
  testing, drag racing or towing heavy trailers for the first 1000
  miles.</p>
  
  <h2>Oil</h2>
  
  <p>I customarily change the oil in a new engine after about 20 miles, and
  again at 1000 or so. That 20-mile oil, you would think, would look
  pretty much like fresh oil right out of the bottle. Wrong. It usually
  looks more like metal-flake paint, iridescent with tiny particles of
  metal worn off rubbing surfaces inside the new engines. After a few
  hours of operation, this completely normal phenomenon slows down as
  the rings, camshaft, lifters and bearings burnish their respective
  mating surfaces.</p>

"Why would a water pump be run off of the timing belt?","6606","","<p>I drive a 1999 Chrysler 300M, V6 3.5L engine. I am about to start a water pump replacement repair. I've discovered that the water pump is driven off of the timing belt, rather than either of the two fan belts on the front. This obviously complicates the repair quite a bit. What is the advantage to running it off of the timing belt? Why is it designed this way?</p>
","<p>I think the main reason for this is convenience. It's an easy place to run the water pump. If you ran it out to a fan belt, it would be in the way of the timing belt while doing it, or it would be a really awkward mess trying to work around it. The second reason is for compactness. With the water pump stuck out of the way, it physically makes the engine shorter, which means it will fit in the hole which is the engine bay a little easier. </p>

<p>Most overhead cam engines which run a timing belt use this method to propel the water pump. It has been done this way for a long while.</p>

<p>On a separate note, since you are in there replacing your water pump, replace the timing belt and any tensioners which may be there with it. No sense in having to take it apart in another couple thousand miles to get it done. This would be the same reasoning behind getting the water pump done when you do your timing belt. It's just cheap insurance and beats having to do the same work twice.</p>

<p>Is there supposed to be space for play in the brakes? It seems like there is too much. I installed the brakes and I do hear noises so I'm guessing Advanced Auto Parts had the wrong size, or I just need to give the brakes some time to break in?</p>
","<p>Your brake pads need to fit exactly in the width of the caliper. You can't have any space there as it might be dangerous if you need to push hard on the brakes. The pads can be a little longer or shorter than your previous ones. If your pads are longer, the surface of the brakes touching the discs will be larger, thus will generate more friction and therfore better stopping power. In contrast will shorter brake pads generate less friction and therefore a litte less stopping power. Your brake pads must be within certain limits the manufaturer specifies, though. they can't be too large and they certainly can't be smaller than the size of the surface of the brake pistons.</p>

<p>It's normal you needed to hammer the old ones out, as the brake pads might be stuck due to extreme temperature changes. Before you read on, make sure your brake fluid is within the limits on the reservoir, your brake pads touch the discs and the cap of the brake fluid reservoir is <strong>closed</strong>!</p>

<p>If you just replaced your brakes its best to ""brake them in"" to make them last longer and let them do their job better. Look for an open road with as few traffic as possible and accelerate to some decent speed and push on the brakes as hard as you can without creating any flat-spots on your tires.. Make sure there is nothing in the car that can get flying, though :). You will notice that there will be a sqeezy noise on the first few brake attempts. This is perfectly normal. You'll know when your brakes are ready when they are almost ""silent"". While you are doing this, make sure the car doesn't tend to go to the side of the road. Now you're ready to head out and use your brakes as you normally would.</p>

"Why did my car stall when I used the foot brake?","6575","","<p>Preface: I drive a 2004 Peugeot 206, manual</p>

<p>On the motorway the other night, one of my tires blew out. I managed to pull over and change to the spare wheel in about 30 minutes (having never changed a tire before! Lesson learned!) but because it was dark I decided to leave the dipped headlights on in addition to the hazard warning lights. Additionally, I stupidly left the sat nav plugged in. As a result, when I got back in to start the car, my old battery had given up the ghost and was completely dead (soon enough, even the hazard warning lights stopped working).</p>

<p>After being jump started the mechanic put a meter across the battery and said he suspected I may have some issue with the alternator or an earthing wire however, after driving for a while, the battery charged enough to start the car the next morning so the alternator is clearly working to some efficiency.</p>

<p>Whilst driving after the jump start and while the battery was still very low on power, I noticed that when I applied the foot brake heavily, the engine would stall but I managed to bump start it on the existing forward momentum. I wonder whether this occurred because applying the foot brake caused the power draw on the alternator (from the brake lights) to be too much and there was no longer enough power to spark the engine (I am not much of a mechanic, this is only a suspicion). </p>

<p>Normally, I would think the alternator provides more power than the battery and this should not occur but if the alternator wasn't working at maximum efficiency, is this a plausible scenario and how would I confirm?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I think you called it on the first try.  Keep in mind that the alternator has three major jobs (in a very simplified sense): producing spark, running the accessory systems (of which the headlights and power brakes are critical components) and charging the battery.  A deeply discharged battery is going to require significant continuous charge vs. a light trickle charge.  If you add an additional mechnical load on the system, you remove some of the available kinetic energy that was being converted into electrical energy.  If net energy dropped too low, you could below the critical voltage to maintain the idle revs.</p>

<p>In my car, I have a gauge showing the voltage in the system.  If you don't have a similar indicator, you can do a casual test by trickle charging your battery for a few hours (using a hardware store battery charger) and seeing if your car still stalls on braking.  Running the headlights and AC will also put additional draws on the system.</p>

<p>Now remember, no stall is not the same as no problem.  However, a super dead battery is a lot of load for your little alternator to carry.  That was likely the cause of your stalling.</p>

<p>Normally, it isn't a problem when the car is parked in the garage, but I can't take my car on camping trips because the humming sound keeps me awake at night!</p>

<p>Specifically, I hear a humming sounds that seems to come from the car's undercarriage.  It seems to be louder outside the car than inside the car.  The humming sound is at a nearly constant pitch; it sounds almost as if there is a person underneath my car humming very loudly.</p>

<p>Each hum lasts for several seconds and the hums are minutes apart, but I've noticed that they seem to go on indefinitely.</p>

<p>There appears to be no problem what-so-ever with driving the car; it just makes this strange sound over and over when it is parked.</p>

<p>What could be causing the problem and how can I fix it?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I've been working on a timing belt change on this car.  I've noticed that even with the battery disconnected, it still keeps making the sound!</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: This question is getting old, but the car still has the same issue.  Last weekend, I changed the front struts on my car.  I drove it about 200 miles to where I raised it up to work on it.  It was about 100 deg F outside and the car made that awful sound about once every two or three minutes (much more frequently than I remember in the past).  Once again, I disconnected the battery and the noise continued just as before.  It went on and on for hours.</p>

<p>Finally, I crawled under the car and found that the sound is coming from a grayish-blue plastic box with several electrical connections going into it.  It is mounted about half-way between and slightly forward of the rear tires.</p>

<p>The next morning, I continued work after the car sat overnight and the sounds had stopped completely.  I poured in a quart of motor flush, idled the engine for a few minutes, and changed the oil, and the sound was still stopped.</p>

<p>With that information, can anyone tell me what this odd plastic box is and why it's making loud humming sounds?</p>
","<p>I happen to have the same experience as you when sitting in my 1998 Honda Accord after it has been shut off.  The humming sound lasts 5-6 seconds, and it can be 5 to 10 minutes apart.  The noise is definitely coming from underneath the car ahead of the rear wheels, not from the engine.  I have also noticed that I have never heard the noise in the winter, only in the 70-110F range.</p>

<p>From people I've talked to, it could be a part of the EVAP system, (located at the rear of the car on '98 Accords, possibly yours too) venting excess pressure from the gas tank.</p>

<p>The fact that you heard it coming on more frequently in 110F weather could make sense because air expands at high temperatures; therefore, the pump goes off more often.  </p>

<p>Here is a picture of the EVAP system for the <em>6th generation Honda Accord</em>.  I also went and looked at pictures of the <em>7th generation Accord</em>, and the <em>2nd generation Acura TL</em>.  All three pictures showed the same location of the ""EVAP canister vent shut valve"", ahead of the gas tank and under the floor of the car.</p>

"What would cause a clutch master cylinder to go bad?","6526","","<p>I have a 1980 Honda Prelude and have only driven it a few hundred miles per year for the 10 years I've owned it. Redid the clutch when I got it, with new cylinders and everything.</p>

<p>Last week I got in it having not driven the car for several months, and the clutch was just dead. No hydraulic pressure at all. Two days ago I bled the line and put in new fluid. It was working again although the pedal still was only coming up half-way.</p>

<p>Today I was driving and with my foot, I pulled the pedal all the way up. Then when I pushed it back down, no pressure again -- somehow air got in the line from me lifting up the pedal all the way like that.</p>

<p>I looked at the master cylinder and it has yellowish residue on it. Is that a sign that it's got a leak? There is also what looks like red mold or rust on the shafts of the pedals, since the car has been leaking moisture into the interior (I live in a city where it rains a lot). </p>

<p>My question is, firstly, what would cause the clutch hydraulics to leak and get air inside if the car wasn't even being driven? I probably didn't add clutch fluid in several years so I'm assuming it just evaporates slowly over time, but my brakes haven't had the same problem so I wonder if it's something else.</p>

<p>What could cause the master clutch cylinder to leak after not many miles? Defect? Maybe from freezing repeatedly over several winters?</p>

<p>I'm just wondering if it's worth bleeding again or if I'm likely to run into the same issue. </p>
","<p>Your best (easiest/cleanest) bet is to replace the master/slave cylinder assembly. The main part of play here is <em>lack of use</em>. What happens is seals dry out and when you then subsequently use the clutch, extra wear is put on the seal, which allows it to wear much quicker. You can avoid this situation by driving the car at least once a month until the entire vehicle is warmed up (engine, transmission, coolant, wheel bearings ... <em>everything</em>). Take it out for a weekend drive for an hour and you should be golden. With that, you should also start the vehicle about once a week. Also, put some type of fuel stabilizer in your tank and keep the tank as full as possible. Also, even though you are not driving the vehicle much, you still want to change the oil once a year as well.</p>

<p>As far as the pedals go, you need to take them apart, clean, then grease them. There may be nylon or plastic bushings at the top which might need to be replaced as well. You are getting rid of the ""red mold"" (which is rust, most likely) which has invaded. </p>

<p>When all of this is said and done, if you want to keep the car, invest in a car cover. If you don't, you are just allowing nature to reclaim the vehicle.</p>

","<p>Unfortunately there is no way to fix what ails your Ford here. You'll need to replace the spindle, hub, and I believe rotor as well (it appears the hub and rotor are one piece - is this correct?). There is no way to salvage this with out taking it to a machine shop, unless you have some mad machining skills (which I assume you don't, or you'd know the answer to this already). You can probably pick up the spindle as a used part at a junk yard, or scour the F150 forums for a part-out like your truck. The new bearings within a short period of time will start spinning in the same locations as these are. Save your new bearings and buy the parts you need to fix this right.</p>

"Disabling OBD2-Interface in a car","6521","","<p>If a car-thief wants to steal a modern car, he often uses the OBD2 (On Board diagnosis) to ""hack"" the car. 
Simplified: He achieves this by plugging his ""hacking device"" in the port, which aquieres the code for the engine immobilizer. With the code he is able to start the car.</p>

<p>Now for my own car I want to manipulate said OBD2-interface by changing some Pins. The workshop for sure still need access to the port for maintenance, so I want to use an adaptor which undoes the changes.</p>

<p>Here is the Pin-schema for the OBD-plug</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/R891J.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/R891J.jpg"" alt=""OBD2""></a></p>

<p><strong>What would be the best way to manipulate this plug?</strong></p>

<p>I thought about switching pin 7 (K-Line), with pin 16 (12 Volts). Will this damage the hacking-tool of the thief, if he plugs in his device? Or would it a better idea to switch GND and 12V? </p>

<p>Do you have other suggestions on how to achieve my goal?</p>
","<p>Your glossing over how the hack actually happens. The hack involves erasing the old keys and then reprogramming a new key to the vehicle. If the car uses a smart key then you're in right away. If the car has a physical key then having the correct cut of key is also required. </p>

<p>Cars also fall into two categories. The first is the real expensive cars that would be stolen by a professional to chop up. They prefer the car intact. If your in this category then just insure the car well, if you bought an expensive car then you can afford it. Also voiding the warranty on an expensive car is no fun.</p>

<p>The second is a cheap car but in a bad neighborhood. Regardless if the thief is skilled enough to pull of the hack or not they don't care what the condition of the car is. A broken window would not be uncommon. I would not be surprised if after their hack tool fried, assuming it would be, they would just vandalize the car. </p>

<p>As mentioned by @Passerby you will have problems if taking the car to a repair or inspection facility. Further if tampering with the diagnostic port damages someone very very expensive equipment you could be held liable. </p>

<p>I would suggest investing in a general run of the mill alarm that cuts the line to the starter. It adds a second layer of stuff to go through to steal the car and no other person would complain. Alarms are common enough, they incorporate motion detectors and siren won't leave you liable for thousands a dollars.</p>

"Is every BMW service, always needed?","6511","","<p>Is every BMW service, always needed? </p>

<p>I have a BMW 325i 2004. It's supposed to be due for a service. The advisor says it includes the regular oil change, check fluids and top off fluids as well as differential oil change and it will cost $699. The only thing I see that may be worth doing, besides the oil change, is the differential oil change. Is this really worth doing? In the past I've done these types of scheduled maintenance only to discover a week later that I needed new brake pads but they didn't even check the brakes—unrelated but still—I'm leery of these expensive maintenance procedures. </p>

<p>Is this service really necessary? I'm wondering what others do about these scheduled maintenances.</p>
","<p>I would follow the maintenance schedule that's in your owner's manual. I wouldn't worry so much about the service package (e.g. 60,000 mile service) the dealership is trying to sell you. </p>

<p>The dealership service package many times contains things that aren't in your maintenance schedule, or are done sooner than your maintenance schedule requires. The dealerships don't usually customize their services packages to each car or car line they sell; they have more of a catch all. So, for example, car A requires the timing belt to be changed at 90,000 miles, Car B requires it at 60,000 miles. Since the dealership sells and services both Car A &amp; B they include a timing belt change in the 60,000 mile service. If you own car A you just changed your timing belt at 66% of its life. They also pad their services with extras. For example, your maintenance schedule says to rotate the tires every 7,500 miles. The service package includes rotate and balance, but you don't need to balance your tires unless they are out of balance (e.g., you feel a vibration at X MPH.) Your maintenance schedule says check the steering and suspension components for signs of wear, while the dealership package includes an alignment. You don't need an alignment unless you have irregular tire wear or a symptom that needs to be fixed (e.g., the steering wheel is off center). I could go on and on but I think you get the point.</p>

"Replacing a Ford Focus electric power steering pump","6510","","<p>The electric power steering pump in our 2006 Ford Focus 1.8 TDCi 5 Door Hatchback (this is a UK car) has failed and I plan to replace this myself. The part in question looks like this:</p>

"Motorcycle bogs down under load","6506","","<p>I recently did a head gasket repair on my 1986 Kawasaki GPZ1000RX and now that everything is back together it starts up fine, idles fine, and revs high without a problem while in neutral, but when I put it into gear and started driving it it'll drive fine when giving it slight throttle, but when I get to the higher revs, or when I open the throttle too quickly it bogs down badly, and starts stuttering, but eventually starts revving higher and leveling out. It sounds as if my carbs were dirty or clogged but they were literally cleaned a day prior to me test driving the bike.</p>

<p>I previously cleaned the carbs thoroughly before the second time cleaning it and it had sat for a while after that so I cleaned them again and found a little bit of dirt and stuff, and after trying it out after I cleaned it the bike bogs down a little less, but it's still noticeable, especially around the 6k range. The bike also dies whenever I press the choke in while it's warmed up, even slightly. I tried starting the bike with the choke and it'll work until it warms up a little bit, then anything after that kills it.</p>

<p>This never happened before, only just now. Bike used to have perfect throttle response before taking everything apart, and now it just seems to be bogging down more. I'm sure I got the timing right, and everything is in order, just not sure on what could be causing the bogging down, unless a carb passage is blocked by a foreign particle or something.</p>

<p><strong>Side note:</strong> the air box fittings are also a little warped and they don't fit completely over the carbs, this didn't affect the carbs much before but I'm.not sure if it could be affecting it now along with other things maybe. </p>

<p>Any help would be great, thanks!</p>
","<p><strong>You are describing a lean condition</strong></p>

<p>The more you open your throttle the more vacuum you are creating in your carburetor venturi and your intake manifold.  When you are operating at higher RPM any unmetered air leaks into your system can become more obvious.</p>

<p>Unmetered air is air that is getting into your system after the fuel has been delivered.  If you have unmetered air getting into your system between the butterfly of the carburetor and the cylinder head this will create a lean condition.</p>

<p>All of the rubber components of the fuel system like vacuum hoses and intake manifolds that you mount the carburetors to are made of rubber.  Since your MC is 30 years old now if none of those components have been changed out they are more than likely highly degraded and possibly cracked in places.  When you disassembled the engine and removed the head you must have removed the rubber intake manifolds.  After 30 years of being in the same position it's very possible that they cracked a bit while pulling them off. As well, you could have missed some vacuum lines when you reassembled the fuel delivery system.</p>

<p>Here is a QA regarding lean and rich setting of MC carburetors.  About halfway into the response there is relevent information regarding how to test for air leaks.</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p><strong>Action Items</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Check all of your vacuum lines and vacuum plugs for carburetor synchronization.  the vacuum plugs are on the head just after the rubber intake manifolds.  The petcock has a vacuum line as well as part of the emission system.</p></li>
<li><p>Check the manifolds for cracks</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure the bands used to tighten the manifolds down on the carburetor are secure and have not bound up the manifolds.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Fix your airbox mounting to the carburetors</strong></p>

<p>You said</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the air box fittings are also a little warped and they don't fit completely over the carbs</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your airbox is metering air and is the first step in a process of consuming air and fuel.  The system requires the resistance of the air filter in order to get the proper vacuum to 'suck' the fuel out of the float bowl and create the proper <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venturi_effect"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">venturi effect</a>.</p>

<p>The mounting of the airbox issue you have will create a small lean effect.  This might be a game of inches for you so just get that one out of the way.  It's not correct, you are getting dust and debris in your engine that is doing slow damage by not having proper fitment.  Fix it so you know it's not contributing to your issue.  Pick the low hanging fruit first.</p>

<p><strong>One last thing</strong></p>

<p>Do not go and start adjusting anything at this point.  It ran fine before.  There is something wrong with the assembly or a component.  Do not adjust your floats.  Get it back to where it was.  The moment you start tweaking everything is the moment you lose the state of the vehicle.  Move onto that activity as a last resort.  Troubleshoot, gather data, draw a conclusion, remediate.</p>

"How can I diagnose gradual electric power loss in a VW Golf Mk5?","6472","","<p>I'm experiencing loss of electrical power to my Mk5 Golf. It seems to happen mostly when the car hasn't been run for two or three days.</p>

<p>We changed the battery a few months ago. More recently, there was a loss of power and the car wouldn't start. We'd diagnosed it as the alternator, which was replaced. This worked fine for a week or so, but I'm now at the problem where I'm experiencing loss of electrical power - car sounds uncertain about starting, clock is reset etc. There's still some power, because the radio, lights and clock etc still operate, even if the car doesn't start.</p>

<p>The remote locking feature only half works, too.  I can lock remotely, but I can't unlock remotely - I have to use the key. The fob has started to show a red light when the unlock button is pressed.</p>

<p>I'm assuming the electrical power is being lost somewhere else. I'd previously checked for doors not shutting properly or anything else I could think of that might leave a light on, but there was nothing to suggest that was happening.</p>

<p>So how might I start to diagnose how the car is losing electrical power? I'm completely stumped.</p>
","<p>The fault you describe appears to be a simple matter of 'parasitic drain' on the battery. </p>

<p>Disconnect the battery earth terminal, connect a ampmeter between the cable and the battery post. Run the ampmeter to outside of the bonnet and close the bonnet without trapping the ampmeter wires. Make sure all doors are closed, they do not have to be locked. After about 10 minutes, check the amp reading.</p>

<p>After around ten minutes all modules will go to 'sleep'. The ampmeter reading should now be at about 0.03 amps to 0.5 amp max. The doors must be closed as opening the doors activates the initial operation of the fuel pump, the bonnet being open activates isolation of the windscreen wipers. Both of these mean the vehicle will not go to sleep.</p>

<p>If the ampmeter shows a high reading, you must now systematically disconnect circuits until the amps drop off. One way is to disconnect one fuse at a time, check the ampmeter. If it has now dropped, that is the circuit that is causing the drain. Rectify as necessary. If the amps do not drop replace the fuse and then disconnect the next fuse. Repeat the procedure to find the drain. If you have none standard accessories, such as amplifiers, the disconnecting routine should start with these.</p>

<p>Finally, even if a battery or a replacement alternator are new there is an outside chance that they may be defective and this should be borne in mind.</p>

"Why smaller engines on newer vehicles","6432","","<p>I've been searching for some cars on the internet and I've observed that newer cars get smaller engines.</p>

<p>For instances, I've found a Ford Focus diesel 1.6, or even a Mercedess A Klass 2015 diesel has a 1.6 engine, which seem to be both good.</p>

<p>Could you explain why?</p>
","<p>Smaller engines provide a myriad of benefits versus huge engines. 
Mainly it's fuel efficiency which also translates into emissions. The less fuel you burn, the fewer amount of gasses that get expelled from the engine. Not only that, but weight is something to consider as well. Space in the engine bay for more accessories is also something the engineers enjoy about it as well. </p>

<p>You don't need huge 8 cylinder engines in regular cars anymore because engineering has come to a point where a 1.4L can push a huge car. It's all about engine design. You won't get the torque you would out of 6 or 8 cylinders, but for a daily driver that gets you from point A to point B; That's all you really need. Additionally, with the ever growing implementation of forced induction (Turbos and superchargers) becoming normal, horsepower and torque is more easily achieved in much smaller engines. I've seen little 2.0L that push 275HP stock out of the factory, which would be near impossible had a turbo not been used. </p>

<p>Mainly though it has to do with fuel consumption and emissions. As a side note, I don't mind it either; It's much easier for technicians to work on.</p>

<p>Looks don't matter because they're steel rims covered by plastic wheel covers.</p>
","<p>If it's not badly-damaged, you may be able to repair the rim instead (or have it repaired by someone). If it's just dented or slightly out of shape, a firm hit with a heavy hammer and a round-end punch could put it back in shape. Put some paint on the scratch and off you go. Have it checked/balanced by a tire shop; if it does not come back with an excessive quantity of weights, you're fine. Usually, the shop will tell you beforehand if something's wrong.</p>

<p>If you notice a crack on the wheel, junk it. Give it to someone that could re-use it as scrap metal.</p>

<p>If you end up buying a new rim, since it's at the rear and your car is a FWD, you should not have to worry too much about its size or its weight.

"We have fuel injection, why not air injection?","6392","","<p>I'm finishing studying EFI systems, which set me thinking about induction more generally.</p>

<p>We inject fuel from a high-pressure common rail for many good reasons. We're capable of making stratified burn within a cylinder, provided we have full control of the throttle butterfly. We sometimes use exhaust gas recirculation to retard combustion and lower cylinder temperature.</p>

<p>Given those scenarios, why don't we add a common rail of high-pressure atmospheric air, and use injectors to introduce air, and exhaust when required, in a similar way to fuel?</p>

<p>Surely this would give me an engine that can respond quicker because there's no lag in the inlet airflow, have fewer mechanical parts and potentially reduce emissions by allowing me to control the oxygen content at the catalyst more easily?</p>
","<p><strong>Simple reason: volume.</strong> @ 14.7:1 stoich, your input into the cylinder would need to be 14.7x bigger (or push that much more) through a nozzle than you would the fluid which is fuel.</p>

<p>You state it would have fewer mechanical parts, but is that true? You'd have to furnish a mechanical method to create the high pressure air as well as introduce it into the system. You'd have to have some type of tank which would hold the high pressure air. Then that ""high pressure"" would need to be in the 3000-5000 psi range at a guess to ensure proper flow. Think of an air compressor which could keep up with the demand you are talking about.</p>

<p>Let's say we throw some math in the mix (and assume I'm not just being completely stupid ... though the jury is out on that one):</p>

<p>A 2L engine has a swept volume of 2L. If this theoretical engine was running, naturally aspirated and attained an 80% volumetric efficiency (VE), it would be taking in .8L of air every revolution of the crankshaft. The math:</p>

<ul>
<li>2.0L X .8 = <strong>1.6L</strong> - Intake volume for all four cylinders @ 80% VE </li>
<li>1.8L x .5 = <strong>.8L</strong> - Intake volume for every revolution in a 4 cycle engine</li>
<li>600rpm x .8L = <strong>480L</strong> - Amount of air at idle needed to maintain idle speed</li>
<li>6000rpm x .8L = <strong>4800L</strong> - Amount of air at redline to maintain fastest engine speed</li>

<p>around on the back of your car, it might be doable. The 170CFM is a figure for the small, lower horsepower end of the equation. What about performance cars where you have three times as much swept volume (6.3L Chevrolet LT1 engine) with a greater VE (~85% at a guess). Those numbers are hugely greater. You'd be tripling the amount of air needed, which means triple the amount you'd be towing behind the vehicle.</p>

<p>Yes it could be done, but at what cost? The way air is introduced into the engine now is far more efficient and introduces far more air than you could reliably continue to pump air into an engine the way you suggest. </p>

"Spark plug wire resistance","6358","","<p><strong>Question(s):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>What should the Resistance be for spark plug wires on a 2000 Blazer?</li>
<li>If they're supposed to be 2,000-3,000 Ohms, at what ohms should you look to replace them?</li>
<li>Is the resistance of all/most spark plug wires the same between vehicles?</li>
<li>Should I take the $30 Duralast wires back and get the $70 AC Delco wires?</li>
<li>Should Straight Booted wires differ in resistance from cornered boot wires? Because as the measurements suggest the straight ones are close to 3,000 ohms but the others are closer to 2,000 ohms.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>

<p>I have been having misfires in my 2000 Blazer V6 4WD. I've done basic maintenance (Changed filters, oil change, etc.) and changed all 6 spark plugs.</p>

<p>I read that you could check your spark plugs using an ohm meter. I've read multiple inconsistent posts on what the Ohms should be some said 4,600 - 7,500, others said 50,000. I personally got around 2,000 to 3,000 for each wire when I measured (Assuming that 2.0 when the meter is set to 20K is 2,000 Ohms).</p>

<p>I just found <a href=""http://www.autozone.com/autozone/repairinfo/repairguide/repairGuideContent.jsp?pageId=0996b43f8025ef64"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> stating that the wires should be 1,200-1,500 ohms per foot. So 2,400-3,000 with my 2 foot wires.</p>

<p><strong>New Duralast ($30) Spark plug wires</strong> (Measured in 20K Ohms setting):</p>

<ul>
<li>Cornered Boots: 2.38, 2.37, 2.50, 2.13</li>
<li>Straight Boots: 3.01, 2.16</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Old Spark plug wires</strong> (Measured in 20K Ohms setting):</p>

<ul>
<li>Straight: 2.95</li>
<li>Cornered: 2.55, 2.32</li>
</ul>

<p>(I only measured 3 because the others are a pain to get to)</p>

<p>Sorry for all the questions but I assume since they're all related it is okay to ask them in a single question. Please say so if I should split them into multiple questions.</p>
","<p>The purpose  of the resistance in the plug wires is there so that the (1) plug firing voltage is great enough to maintain a sufficent spark firing time and (2) the resistance suppresses interferance with electronic equipment and radios. Spark plug wires are easily broken internally when being removed from the plug, as they can become attached to the spark plug. Try 'blipping' the throttle, pressing the throttle to raise the engine RPM to 1500RPM and releasing. If this is where your misfire is most pronounced then its a safe bet to change the wires. The higher voltage produced on initial acceleration will find any internal breakage and cause the misfire. 1500-2000 ohms per foot of cable is usually present, even on a bad spark plug wire, the misfire happens on the higher voltage. If you have a misfire all of the time, remove one one wire at a time with the engine running, with insulated pliers. When removing a wire which only makes a little or no differance to the engine RPM compared to the others will be the faulty wire. The actual resistance of any cable is down to its length, so differant lengths have differant resistances.</p>

<p>Which one should I choose.</p>

<p>I would also like to know the advantages/disadvantages of each type possible with a image.</p>
","<p>Different types of discs are designed to either improve the performance, or improve the heat dissipation (preventing 'brake fade' which can occur if they get too hot)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Plain solid discs - these are the most basic, as fitted to ordinary cars, they just have a solid block of steel. Perfectly functional for the vast majority of users.</p></li>
<li><p>Vented discs - these are in two layers, with vent spaces between them. This increases the surface area and airflow, allowing more heat to be dissipated, but needs more space as they are thicker than solid discs, and are heavier as they have more metal in them.</p></li>
<li><p>drilled/grooved discs - these have holes drilled through the disc, or grooves milled into the surface, with the intention of increasing the friction between the pads and discs (as they bite the edges) and again increasing the surface area and airflow. They do however weaken the disc, and their usefulness is questionable on a normal road car.</p></li>
<li><p>carbon ceramic discs - these are much lighter than steel discs, allowing bigger brakes with more stopping power and heat capacity, with less unsprung mass. They have different heat characteristics to steel discs however, and so need special pads. They're also very expensive!</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For a normal road car, plain discs are fine. For a higher performance road car, or light track car, you'd probably be looking at vented discs on the front, standard on the back. Top end road cars, track cars and racing cars will use carbon brakes...</p>

"Oversize Engine Oil Drain Plug?","6340","","<p>So... I stripped the bottom half of the threads due to trying to use a washer on a non-washer using drain plug. My aluminum oil pan (and plug) turns out to not be the standard oil pan for the vehicle so I have had difficulty finding the right plug size &amp; thread.</p>

<p>I currently drive it still with the same drain plug. I put in oil every now and then...</p>

<p>What is the <em>correct/best</em> way to put in an oversize? Should I drill out the threads first and tap it before putting in the self-tapping plugs? <br>
If I just use the self-tapping ones without drilling &amp; pre-tapping, how effective is that?
<br></p>

<p>Should I use the rubber universal ones?</p>

<p>My current oil pan plug is much smaller than the listed standard size. I got several sizes on hand of 1x Oversize plugs.</p>
","<p>So...<br>
I pretty much took in all the advice you guys gave me (and from elsewhere too) and went ahead with the procedure with the oil pan still on the car.<br>
<strong>One big difference</strong> though: Instead of using a tap, I used my oversize plug... I was stubborn and did not want to buy the tap nor take the pan off the car.</p>

<h2>Here's how I did it:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Jack the car up; stands.</li>
<li>Drained the oil.</li>
<li>I used an oversize ""self-tapping"" plug, put a glob of heavier grease all over the threads (i used silicone-based) and started tapping it into my oil pan with a smaller ratchet. </li>
<li>I ratcheted twice (~&lt;=1/4 turn each) and backed out once. </li>
<li>Repeat #4 until I felt some pressure increase and then I took the plug out all the way, cleaned all the shavings off, re-grease the threads, and started ratcheting again (#4).</li>
<li>Once I got past the middle, at some point I started to feel a lot of pressure, and was forced to switch to my breaker bar. Repeat #5 with breaker bar.</li>
<li>Got to where the rubber gasket touched the oil pan, took out the plug and cleaned it.</li>
<li>Re-greased and threaded the plug in, took it out, and cleaned it. Repeat a few times until the amount of shavings between the threads on the plug are minute. It became significantly easier to put the plug in now.</li>
<li>Poured 1-2 quarts of oil in the top and took the oil plug out from the bottom.</li>
<li>Let engine drain, clean plug, clean inside of the threads of the oil pan (i used a small towel and jammed a small part of it in and threaded it out. got a good amount of shavings out).</li>
<li>Repeat from #9 until the inside of the oil pan threads and the threads on the plug are clean. (it would not <em>completely</em> stop having <strong>some</strong> amount of shavings between the threads when I took the plug out. I'm pretty sure its still grinding a little and generates some shavings as it moves in and out. It's a rather small amount of shavings and they are all stuck in between the threads (and my grease) in the middle of the threads so I feel like its okay... it was late and i got tired so I decided to stop after 1 repeat.)</li>
<li>Put the plug in and fill car with oil, check for leaks.</li>
<li>Start car and check for leaks.</li>
<li>Drive around a bit and came back and checked for leaks.</li>
<li>Seemed good for now (i also have a crank seal leak still)</li>
</ol>

<p>This whole process took a very long time. Steps 1-7 took me 40+ minutes. I took it very slow and did it very carefully. Particularly careful with the breaker bar.</p>

<p>After about a month? or less possibly? I changed the oil again for good measure.
Collected the oil and sent it in for UOA.<br>
Came back relatively good. Slightly higher than baseline for iron but they didnt mention it at all in the notes. Slightly high in chrome, which they did mention, but said just keep an eye on it, its probably fine. I will see on my next UOA.</p>

<p>I did this sometime from mid-February to early March. It is now early June. Still running well (or at least the same as before this operation).</p>

<hr>

<p>I would suggest others to get a <strong>threaded tap</strong> like the ones mentioned in the other answer/comments and use the right size plug for the tap. This would minimize or completely get rid of the small amount of shavings I get between the threads every time I thread the plug in.</p>

<p>Or take the oil pan off and do it properly.</p>

<p>Thanks for your time, Dan.</p>
","<p>Operating temperature of most modern car engines is ~90C (about the same to the thermostat opening temperature) and oil temperature in the sump will be around 10C less than that.</p>

<p>More and more modern cars tend to increase engine operating temperature for increased engine efficiency and reduced emissions, hence they increase oil temperature in the sump.</p>

How important is it to replace the mount?  If I do decide to replace it, is the job as straight forward as it seems?  I imagine I'd just have to remove the two bolts, slide the old one off and slide the new one on.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3WJGY.jpg"" alt=""Engine Mount Overview""></p>
","<p>The torque mount is fairly important. It keeps everything in place when the engine is trying to torque over from either a launch or a stop. While this one isn't <em>completely</em> shot, it needs to be replaced before that happens, so as to not cause issues in other areas of the vehicle. It will eventually affect the other motor mounts (because they have to do the job the torque mount is doing right now ... pick up its slack, let's say). It also causes stress on the exhaust system due to the extra flexing going on.</p>

<p>As far as replacement, you are exactly right. This should be a straight remove/replace operation. As long as your other mounts are in good shape still, you shouldn't have any issues. You may want to ensure you have a long, thin bladed screwdriver to help you get it aligned during installation. Other than that, just make sure you have the same bolts in the same holes and you're golden. (<strong>NOTE:</strong> Each bolt doesn't have to go into the exact hole it came out of: if you have two bolts/nuts which are exactly the same, they can be swapped. I'm just suggesting not to put the wrong size bolts in the wrong holes -- that could get ugly.)</p>

"How to bleed Toyota Tacoma clutch system?","6309","","<p><strong>Vehicle:</strong> 2007 Toyota Tacoma 4WD v6 6 speed</p>

<p>I found <a href=""http://autorepair.about.com/od/fixityourself/ss/MC_bench-bleed.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this tutorial</a> on pre-bleeding but it is generic (not vehicle specific) and I think there are differences between the cylinder it uses and Tacoma's, which makes it hard to translate the instructions practically. The main difference is, I think, that his cylinder has the tank mounted on it directly whereas Tacoma's has a hose that feeds the fluid to it from the brake fluid tank, making it difficult to keep the tank on and topped off like it is suggesting.</p>

<p>As can be seen in the picture below, my master cylinder has an intake nozzle that the rubber hose gets clamped onto. I experimented trying to pour the fluid directly inside (by taking the the white nozzle cap off) and the <strong>fluid was coming inside very, very slowly, as though the nozzle was clogged, with tiny bubbles coming out</strong>. I also wanted to see whether there was cloggage or something (it's a brand new cylinder) cause I was trying to bleed it while it was installed (I took it out since) but the fluid was just not coming in. I also tried venting the slave cylinder but, as I was pumping the clutch pedal, nothing was coming out of there after some initial emulsified spray.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bDi7E.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I also tried to see what happens if I take out the clutch line out of the cylinder while it was installed, while leaving the intake hose in. I thought I was going to get a sh*tstorm of fluid coming out of the line valve as I pumped the pedal but there was almost nothing coming out. So I started questioning whether there was actually fluid coming through the intake hose from the reservoir but there was (there was no cloggage in the intake hose coming out of the firewall, i ran a smaller hose through it and it went through no problem).</p>

<p>No mater how much I would pump the pedal (and the cylinder plunger was properly mounted on it), the cylinder seemed not to be sucking the fluid in from the hose. Which is perhaps explained by the bolded statement above about the experiment with pouring the fluid in directly. However, this is just a speculation.</p>

<p><strong>BONUS QUESTION:</strong> How is the master cylinder nozzle designed to allow the fluid to only come inside without pumping it out in reverse upon the pumping action? Does that design explain why the fluid is so slow to come in (as described in the experiment).</p>
","<p>Here is a standard procedure.  You may need to use a vacuum hand pump to 'prime' the master cylinder.  I have encountered the issue you are describing and the luxury of having a mighty vac to pull the brake fluid through the system.  Once the master cylinder is primed, it becomes much easier and you begin to get traction on getting the air out and having the master cylinder actually act as a pump.</p>

<p>The bleeding procedure is the same as it would be for a hydraulic brake system.</p>

<p>There is a nipple on the master cylinder to bleed out fluid and air, same as a brake caliper.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Pump the clutch to build up pressure (pumping the clutch is referring to depressing it with your foot repeatedly to build up pressure in the hydraulic system, keep clutch depressed)</p></li>
<li><p>Open the nipple/valve on the slave cylinder</p></li>
<li><p>Allow fluid/air to escape from the nipple/valve</p></li>
<li><p>Close nipple/valve on the slave cylinder (see image below for an example of a slave cylinder, the 'nipple' that is being referred to is brass colored)</p></li>
</ol>

<ol start=""5"">
<li><p>Remove pressure from clutch</p></li>

<h1>Mighty Vac alternate bleeding method</h1>

<p>Here is an image of a hand held vacuum pump that many auto stores would carry a version of.</p>

<p>This image of a mighty vac handheld pump is in referrence to alternate method of bleeding the hydraulic system.  Using this vacuum pump has a different procedure than described above.   To use the pump you would put the vacuum line from the handheld pump on the brass nipple on the master cylinder image and open the nipple/valve.  You would then use the pump to suck fluid through the system and dispense of the air.

<h1>Bonus Answer</h1>

<p>Here is an image of a cutaway master cylinder.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qwXNC.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>As you can see, it acts as a one way valve after the plunger passes the gravity fed fluid delivery in the bottom of the reservoir.  Once that point is passed it hydraulically compressing the fluid to displace a piston in either brake caliper or a clutch which is actually actuating whatever component the engineers want it to.  Upon retraction of the plungers the piston is able to pull back and any fluid that needs to be displaced back into the reservoir can have a path to it.</p>

<p>BE SURE THE RESERVOIR ALWAYS HAS BRAKE FLUID IN IT WHILE YOU ARE BLEEDING.</p>

<li><p>Remove the lower ball joint from the lower control arm (see the bottom middle of your second photo). This can be difficult, and lots of the methods people suggest will destroy the ball joint.

<li><p>Lift the hub to free it from the lower control arm, then slide the end of the axle back through it (a hammer can help) and swing the hub out to the side to get it out of the way.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove the other end of the axle from the transaxle/differential. On my vehicle, this is accomplished by prying behind it with a screwdriver. Look closely at what you're doing and be careful not to jam anything in where it could damage something.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Installation is generally the reverse of removal, but there are a few caveats. You might need some force to get the new axle to snap in, but you need to make sure you don't <em>pull</em> on it or you could separate the CV joints. And when you reattach the ball joint, make sure to use a good cotter pin. I once had one fall out or break off and I lost the castle nut while driving...wasn't fun.</p>

<p><strong>Could I use any injection system cleaner with the above procedure or do I need specialized products?</strong></p>
","<p><strong>tl dr</strong> - To directly answer the question, SeaFoam is a pure petroleum product. If an alternative product is made up the same as Seafoam, then I'd think it would work just fine. If its makeup is not similar, you probably won't see the same results. Below is what you are looking for and a recipe for making your own substitute.</p>

<p>I found <a href=""http://hildstrom.com/projects/seafoam/"" rel=""nofollow"">this answer</a> for a SeaFoam substitute online with a very nice write-up. </p>

<p>Basically, the guy broke down what SeaFoam is by looking up the formula on <a href=""http://seafoamsales.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/MSDS_seafoam_EN.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Material Safety Data Sheets</a>. This boils down to three parts: pale oil (ie: diesel fuel), Naphtha, and Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA). Note how all three are petroleum based in one form or another. This is the same as what SeaFoam claims for their product. His suggestions as far as how much of each would be: </p>

<pre><code>4 parts diesel
2 parts naphtha
1 part IPA
</code></pre>

<p>The IPA he suggests needs to be fairly pure IPA and not what you purchase from the drug store. His suggestion is Iso-Heat, but I'm sure that most of the gasoline drying treatments are probably right in-line with this product. Read the back label and get the highest % you can find.</p>

<p>He suggests this worked very well, had nearly the same specific gravity as SeaFoam, was the same basic color as SeaFoam, and did not separate (just like SeaFoam). His write-up seems fairly comprehensive and makes a lot of sense. It sounds as though he's done his research and has come up with a viable alternative.

"What are the Advantages of a Single Side SwingArm on Motorcycles?","6273","","<p>I have noticed that Ducatis , Honda and Triumph have bikes with a Single Sided SwingArm Much like most of the scooters.</p>

<p>Are there any advantages of following this design , if so why are not all manufacturers using it.</p>

<p>Why are all the scooters using a SSSA ? </p>

<p>I have not seen any scooter without a SSSA.</p>
","<p>The information provided by DucatiKiller is excellent.  </p>

<p>I believe the biggest advantage is access, which makes wheel changes and maintenance arguably easier. This could also translate to pit-lane advantage in racing situations.  </p>

<p><em>Particular case</em> - in the case with Ninja H2R -  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Having a single-sided swingarm allows the exhaust pipe to be mounted
  closer to the bike’s centerline, providing a high bank angle for
  sporty cornering.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong> - I actually have zilch experience about what I'm talking about-<strong>Fact.</strong>  </p>

<p>While the point on SSSA being lighter sounds plausible, and it maybe true for certain case by case comparisons I'm not sure if that can be actually generalized. </p>

<ol>
<li>The SSSA would need to be structurally as strong as the double sided swing-arms and hence as such it wouldn't be lighter ? </li>
<li>With SSSA you now have to engineer enough strength at the axle-pivot (?)(where the axle connects to the SSA) to counter the various moments of force, (it is in effect a cantilever kind of setup) which would have been balanced in a Double Sided Swingarm arrangement   </li>
<li>More material concentrated at the axle-pivot, add's to un-sprung weight, more so than the same amount of material evenly distributed over the swing-arm.<br>
All of the above is an over-generalized argument.  </li>
</ol>

<p>Why manufacturers go with a particular design in this case boils down to design decision which may even include aesthetics apart from engineering considerations.<br>
Again, I'm not sure of any of the above.</p>

"Should only the left ""Rear Fog Light"" actually light up in a pair?","6271","","<p>On a 2003 Saab 9-5 Aero, only the left rear fog light lights up.  The right side has a bulb but when I switch the bulbs, the left still is the only side that lights up.</p>

","<p>I did some research on some Saab forums.  I found that typically on US bound Saab 9-5 a bulb is installed on both sides.  However, the metal circuit on the passenger side is cut to disable that side.

"What is an acceptable amount of up/down play in a distributor shaft?","6264","","<p><strong>1995 Chevy S-10 Blazer - 4.3 L Vortec V6 (vin W with PCM)</strong> - This is the distributor style with vertical cap posts.  230,000 miles original owner.  </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:  Please click on <a href=""http://amzn.com/B0010DN0QW"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">link below</a> to see a photo of distributor.  It is the ""DI"" style, not ""HEI"", ""HE"" or ""HVS"".  There are no mechanical counter-weights inside this unit.  AFAIK, all timing is advanced by computer control.</p>

<hr>

<p>Without going into the detailed recent history, I believe I've checked, replaced, and eliminated every other source or possible cause of my rough idle condition.  I narrowed it down to the distributor based on a lot of up/down play in the original, and I assumed gear wear, which gave me what seemed like a huge amount of rotational play (~ 3 to 6 degrees).</p>

<p>So I replaced my original distributor with a <a href=""http://amzn.com/B0010DN0QW"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>Cardone Select</strong> part #84-1635</a>.  Not a rebuild, but supposedly ""brand new"".  The truck definitely runs a lot better, but still not as smooth as I expected considering how many things were checked and fixed.  (Yes, it's been timed to the factory spec of 0 TDC at idle (~650 RPM) with the computer timing wire unplugged.)</p>

<hr>

<p>Since the computer timing wire was disconnected, I did not expect to see any advance on acceleration from idle, yet my timing light shows a timing advance.  How can the timing advance by itself when the computer timing wire is unplugged?  </p>

<p>With the computer timing wire plugged in, the timing mark seems to jump around.  Is this normal?  I was expecting the computer to advance/retard timing smoothly with engine acceleration, not jump back &amp; forth.</p>

<ul>
<li>Do these two observations indicate excessive distributor slop?</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><strong>Up/down shaft play on the original distributor is measured at 0.032""</strong> and not a huge amount of gear wear. For the number of miles and reading about how these gears wear out, I was expecting a lot worse.</p>

<p><strong>Up/down shaft play on the new distributor is 0.021""</strong> &lt;- this still seems like a lot to me, but I'm not sure</p>

<p>Since there was not nearly as much gear wear as I was expecting to see, I'm doubting and second-guessing this new distributor or that I've done everything possible short of an engine rebuild.</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the amount of up/down shaft play supposed to be?  Is there an acceptable range?</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Also, there is a tremendous amount of slop in the engine block hole where the distributor is inserted. The hold-down clamp is firmly holding the distributor in place, but when this clamp is loosened, the entire distributor moves side to side. Don't get me wrong, there is zero side-to-side in the shaft itself. I'm just talking about the entire distributor assembly moving side to side and back &amp; forth in the hole after the gear is meshed and fully seated. Is this normal?  I was expecting the ring under the collar to fit snugly in the hole on the top of the engine block.  I should have tried fitting the original one back in just to answer my own question; and now I regret that I did not.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><s>With the clamp loosened and the collar seated down firmly on its gasket, mine is very sloppy all around (+/- 1/8"").  In other words, the hole is way oversized... is it supposed to be like this or is there something wrong with this new distributor?  I assumed the distributor assembly supposed to fit snugly into the top engine block hole.</s></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Edit</strong>: This third question was resolved by simply inspecting the original gasket.  There is a circular indentation in the original gasket that is offset about 1/16"" from the center point.  In other words, the original distributor was also not self-centering in the engine block hole.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong>:</p>

<p>While at Auto Zone today, I asked to see the Duralast distributor.  It's new (not rebuilt) and I believe made by Spectra since it used the same photo and part number.  I did a really quick check on the up/down play and it was more than 0.030"".  That's about the same as mine with 230,000 miles.  Either it does not matter and they all have a lot of slop, or these imported replacements are not up to spec.  This is what my question here is mostly about... the correct GM specifications.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT 3</strong>:</p>

<p>Remaining roughness in the idle was finally tracked down to a loose heat shield that was intermittently shorting out the spark plug boot for cylinder #4.</p>

"Brightening dim headlights","6204","","<p>The headlights on my car are very dim. When on the normal setting they only illuminate around 2-3 seconds down the road @ about 55mph. The high beams are brighter, but are still very dim. If I have my high beams on and a car is behind me with their high beams off their lights will outshine mine. What can I do to get brighter headlights?</p>

<p>Some background on what I've tried:
I replaced one of the casings for the lights (due to an accident with a deer, which I partly blame on my headlights being so dim). I thought the new casing might make some difference as it was much more clear, but it made none.</p>

<p>I've also replaced the bulbs with ones that claim to be the brightest available but there is no noticeable difference. Unfortunately I don't recall the name and number.</p>

<p>My car is a 1994 940 Volvo, so it may be due to the age of something.</p>
","<p>Having owned several of that generation Volvo ('93 965, '94 964, '94 965), I will start by saying ""The US delivery Volvo headlights of that era are terrible!""  The light does not go where it needs to go, and even adding more light will not help that much.</p>

<p>I have had some success putting the Sylvania XS bulbs in. They have a slightly different spectrum from normal halogen bulbs, but they are <em>NOT</em> the blue headlights.</p>

<p>In terms of converting to HID, you will probably end up spending a lot of money and still not have light where you want/need it.</p>

<p>There are a couple of other solutions: European Delivery cars had much better headlights.  It's not a cheap conversion, but it can be done.  (I am not saying anything about US street legality here.)  The ""prize"" lights are the 3 bulb units from the Euro 960 -- separate low, high and fog beams.</p>

<p>The other option is to add auxiliary lights. At first it may seem a fairly high cost, but when you realize that one set can easily outlive several cars, it really isn't that much.</p>

"What is the best way to remove a stripped head bolt that is deep in the engine?","6162","","<p>One of the head bolts on my 1997 Mercedes C230 stripped during removal. It is a 12 point star, I think they made be called triple square splines. The others are about 4 inches long stretch bolts. There isn't enough space to get anything in there. </p>

<p>Some suggestions I have heard so far and have tried some are hammering a larger size into it, using an impact driver, and welding a socket onto it to give it something to grab. Keep in mind its an aluminum block.</p>
","<p>If the bolt is so obscured that vise grips and welding are not feasible, and so stripped that impact doesn't make sense (I am guessing it is too stripped), I usually do the following. <strong>If it's very stripped, you might want to skip ahead to step 8.</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>(Look ahead to step four; you'll probably want to take one of your bolts to the auto parts store before starting this process.)</p></li>
<li><p>Torque down the other bolts in order (follow manual).</p></li>
<li><p>Add about 5 ft*lb to the bolts nearest to the stripped bolt (this is intended to unload the culprit bolt) and don't plan to re-use the head bolts because they're overstretched now.</p></li>
<li><p>Get the next size up allen key or torx bit that will almost fit into it and hammer it on. I'd recommend doing this with a bit you don't care about, preferably impact rated due to hardness. I'd recommend 1/2"" drive for this bit if space allows. If you're wondering what will fit, see this diagram:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/It7yQ.jpg"" alt=""triple square versus 12 point socket""></p>

<p>That diagram shows the difference between your bolt (left) and a 12 point socket (right). Notably, an allen key or torx bit would fit into this. If your fastener is standard, use a metric (and vise versa) to get a size that's just a little bit off (i.e. a little bit bigger).</p></li>
<li><p>When you're done swinging the hammer, soak everything in penetrating oil.</p></li>
<li><p>If you're feeling confident after hammering, feel free to try removing it <strong>BY HAND</strong> now. If you use impact tools with this technique, you will successfully extract the bit from the bolt and continue having a bad day.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you feel it start to strip, stop and apply more penetrating oil and apply some heat.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If that strips out or you don't feel confident in the seating, consider trying a different sacrificial tool.</p></li>
<li><p>If the above doesn't work, clean up the bolt with brake cleaner, get a new sacrifical bit, and JB weld the two together following the above process. Wait at least 8 hours and then take it off by hand. Don't forget to apply liberal penetrating oil (after the JB weld is set) and I would personally apply heat to the bolt only at this point.</p></li>
<li><p>The bolt will be out. On reassembly, chase the hole gently with a tap and blow it out with an air compressor. If it took your block's threads with it, get a helicoil, install it, and use a lot of oil (maybe even anti-seize) on the coil threads when you re-attach the head if you want to be able to remove it. When you go to try removing the bolt from the helicoil in the future, it will likely take aluminum with it. Helicoils are nightmares in disguise. Seriously consider never removing the head again if it comes to this.</p></li>

"2001 Honda Civic: rough ride, even after new struts","6140","","<p>My 2001 Honda Civic has what I can only describe as a ""rough ride"" in the front wheels.  When I put my foot on the brake pedal (not pressing on it), there's a roughness there I can feel.  It's less at lower speeds and increases at higher speeds.</p>

<p>I just spent $1400+ today at the Honda dealership.  They replaced:</p>

<ol>
<li>both front struts </li>
<li>front lower control arm compliance bushings</li>
<li>motor mount</li>
<li>both outer sway bar end links</li>
</ol>

<p>The ride is still the same.  So I'm wondering if these repairs should have fixed the ride or if the roughness I feel in the ride and on the brake pedal is due to something else?</p>
","<p>Normally strut failure makes it to where they are ineffective in dampening the movement of the vehicle on the springs.</p>

<p>This wouldn't cause a ""rough"" ride but in fact the opposite making it very soft and wavy.  Where you'd hit a bump and the car would bounce multiple times as it settles back down on the springs.  The strut reduces that movement allowing the suspension to move to absorb the initial impact without continuing to bounce.</p>

<p>The potential for the strut to cause a rough ride would be if it had seized instead of losing its pressure.  If the shock seized to the point where it won't move at all or takes a lot of force to do so, then it would cause it to carry more of the road imperfections to you.</p>

<p>A bad bushing will allow the component to move more.  This can have multiple effects depending on how the component fits.  It may allow for a metal on metal contact, which can transfer a lot of vibration.  On the other hand, it can move around more and not send as much through as it isn't held in place. A new OEM bushing or an aftermarket polyurethane can make you feel the bumps slightly more, but is an acceptable trade off for the improved handling and driver feedback. When you go to turn the vehicle, with bad bushings fractions of seconds are lost making the ""turn in"" of the car happen later as the components shift in place before they stiffen and then push the car instead of moving themselves.</p>

<p>If the feeling is there all the time and doesn't seem to be directly related to road conditions, there might be a wheel out of balance (circular balance, where the weight around the circumference of the wheel isn't even), a flat spot on a tire (can be caused from a hard braking event or sitting for an extended period of time not in use).</p>

<p>It may also need a front end alignment, especially if they didn't do one after taking apart the control arms for the bushings.  If your toe or camber are far enough out, it could be causing a noticeable effect.  If you don't hold onto the steering wheel on smooth pavement, does the car track straight or shift to the left or right?  That is one sign of misalignment.</p>

<p>If you've used any of that spray fix-a-flat products, I've heard of people having bad vibrations after the use of those as you are spraying material inside of your tire with no way of getting it in there evenly.</p>

<p>Unfortunately many things can be the cause of a ""rough"" ride.</p>

<p>What is the length of time required for the 'drive cycle reset' to occur?</p>
","<p>This is a bit complicated, but I found the information for you on <a href=""http://www.toyotapart.com/READINESS_MONITOR_DRIVE_PATTERNS_T-EG02-003.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this pdf</a>. I am pulling the graphs out of it so you can see what you need to do. Rather than retype everything, I'm cutting/pasting some of the precursor directions here:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are some prerequisites you should know. First, you need a scan tool to tell you when any of the drive cycles are complete and the On–Board Diagnostic (OBDII) system is designed to monitor the performance of emission–related components and report any detected abnormalities in the form of Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs). Since the various components need to be monitored during different driving conditions, the OBDII system is designed to run separate monitoring programs called Readiness Monitors. Many state Inspection and Maintenance (I/M) programs require that vehicles complete their Readiness Monitors prior to beginning an emissions test.</p>
  
  <p>The current status of the Readiness Monitors can be seen by using the Toyota Diagnostic Tester with version 9.0 software (or newer), or a generic OBDII Scantool.</p>
  
  <p>To view the Readiness Monitor status using the Toyota Diagnostic Tester, select “Monitor Status” from the Enhanced OBDII Menu.</p>
  
  <p>A status of “complete” indicates that the necessary conditions have been met to run the performance tests for the related Readiness Monitor.</p>
  
  <p>The Readiness Monitor will be reset to “incomplete” if:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>List item ECU has lost power (battery or fuse). </li>
  <li>DTCs have been cleared. </li>
  <li>The conditions for running the Readiness Monitor have not been met.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>In the event that any Readiness Monitor shows “incomplete,” follow the appropriate Readiness Monitor Drive Pattern to change the readiness status to “complete.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>With some further warnings of:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong></p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>These drive patterns represent the fastest method to satisfy all necessary
  conditions which allow the specific Readiness Monitor to complete.</li>
  <li>In the event that the drive pattern must be interrupted (possibly due to traffic conditions or other factors) the drive pattern can be resumed and, in most cases, the Readiness Monitor will still set to “complete.”</li>
  <li>To ensure rapid completion of Readiness Monitors, avoid sudden changes in
  vehicle load and speed (driving up and down hills and/or sudden acceleration).</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Please don't let this intimidate you. There seems like a lot of prerequisites and such, but really, most, if not all, are pretty straight forward. If you look for patterns in what it's asking you to do, you can probably come up with a plan to have all of them complete in one trip.</p>

<p>This first grid shows which Drive Cycles to actually follow:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YkFhR.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>This shows you need to worry about Drive Cycles 4, 6, 10, &amp; 11. (Note: Mind you, some of these may have already been validated in the amount of time you've had your vehicle back from the mechanic. Pay attention to the Drive Cycles which are left.

"Torque curve on modern turbo-charged petrol engines","6116","","<p>How can modern turbo-charged petrol engines have such constant torque plateaus over a broad rpm range. Does the mathematical relationship between torque and power still hold here? This looks totally different from a normally aspirated engine where torque and power increase gradually.</p>

<p>[<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BshX5.jpg"" alt=""BMW 650i engine performance"">]</p>
","<p>The engine torque produced is a function of the amount of air ingested and the air/fuel ratio combusted in the cylinder(s), combined with 'static' variables like the compression ratio, bore/stroke, crankshaft design, intake length, cam profile, intake and exhaust sizing, etc.</p>

<p>With all the other parameters now static (non-variable) once the engine is built and assembled, and with the ECU controlling the amount of fuel added to the mixture (air/fuel ratio), in gasoline engines torque produced in that engine is now almost entirely a function of air flow. More air in the cylinders = more torque, less air in the cylinders = less torque (speaking of mass here, not volume).</p>

<h2>Natural Aspiration (non-variable)</h2>

<p>Because of this, in a naturally aspirated non-variable cam non-variable intake internal combustion engine, there will be one (and only one) RPM at which the flow will peak, based on the cam profile and intake length (a hump in the graph). You can tune where this peak happens with various cams and heads and valve sizes, but there is only one. (note: this excludes variable intake length and variable cam systems, see below)</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MbXsD.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MbXsD.png"" alt=""Natural Aspiration""></a></p>

<h2>Natural Aspiration (variable cam and/or intake)</h2>

<p>With variable cam profiles, there can be two or more peaks (or even a continuously variable setup in theory) where each distinct cam profile or intake length experiences peak flow (greatest mass charge in the cylinders). This can vary the lift, duration, or both of the valves.

<h2>Forced Induction (regulated)</h2>

<p>Now, let's consider forced induction. With a capable compressor (either supercharger or turbocharger), it will be capable of a variable mass charge through the RPM range. For a number of reasons, bypass/blowoff valves, wastegates, clutches, and similar devices limit the amount to a known value, typically based on pressure (say, 21 psi). At this pressure, if we can assume a constant temperature (which we can't in practice), that would yield a theoretically constant mass of air entering the cylinders under sufficient boost. With a set mass of air, and an ECU injecting a corresponding amount of fuel, <strong>the engine will produce a constant amount of torque</strong>.</p>

<p>Each detonation event will experience the expansion pressure of that set amount of air mass and fuel, and your torque line becomes flat as 21psi of air is forced through the pressurized intake in a constant way (unlike the variable draw of natural aspiration). This will fail to be 'flat' when the compressor is unable to produce more pressure than the regulated amount, which will happen both when the compressor isn't spinning fast enough (too low of RPM) and when the amount of air flow the engine requires at an RPM is greater than the compressor can provide (too high of RPM).</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XEH9Z.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XEH9Z.png"" alt=""Forced Induction""></a></p>

<h2>Forced Induction (unregulated)</h2>

<p>Now in theory, if your engine components were overbuilt to handle lots more torque than they would need to otherwise, you could remove the wastegate/clutch system and to deregulate the peak pressure, essentially allowing the flow characteristics of the compressor to define whatever peak it could produce, all the way until the compressor is so outside of its efficiency that it's heating the air charge (and thus expanding it) so much that it's either causing predetonation, causing components to fail, or reducing the effective air mass even with higher pressure, or some combination thereof. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/C2Dzk.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/C2Dzk.png"" alt=""Unregulated Forced Induction""></a></p>

<h2>Forced Induction - Theory vs Practice</h2>

<p>Also note that there is a big difference between a 'theoretical' dyno chart, with perfectly flat/smooth lines, and a 'true' dyno chart as in practice. Even with a perfectly regulated forced induction system at a set pressure (21 psi in the above example, 7.5psi in the graph below), there will be slight variances due to the temperature and flow characteristics of the intake and cam system at various RPMs, which can lead to slopes and small peaks/valleys in the 'flat-ish' region.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9p2il.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9p2il.png"" alt=""Forced Induction - Real""></a></p>

<h2>Why Flat Torque?</h2>

<p>It would be possible, in theory, to introduce artificial variable restrictions in a naturally aspirated engine to produce the same results, but it would just be wasteful. Alternatively, if you could design a perfect continuously variable cam and intake system, perhaps that system could (in theory) get to a constant air mass and thus flat curve. </p>

<p>The reason the pressure regulation is done with forced induction typically have to do with design constraints, such as the price to overbuild the components to handle the short torque spike, including possibly everything from fuel injector sizing to piston and rod metallurgy, and the corresponding hit that will be taken in reliability for very small gains.</p>

Since it's was red, I thought it best to look up what it meant, and it was the oil pressure light. It's also noticeably tougher to turn the steering wheel all the way to one extreme or the other, like the last quarter turn in either direction, not sure if that's related since I have a very slow power steering fluid leak (I don't even top it off once a year, and just topped it off a couple of months ago).</p>

<p>I'll be checking/adding oil in a couple of hours, but just curious about what other troubleshooting I can do. When I started my car this morning, it was -7 Fahrenheit outside and my car didn't sound good at all. I made it to work, but it drove noticeably different.</p>

<p>Why does it flicker, and not stay consistently on? Is this a sign of bad things to come? </p>
","<p>In my particular case, the cause seemed to be low oil and an oil weight too heavy for the temperature. </p>

<p>I only checked the oil level so late because my low oil light never came on, so the oil must have been low enough to cause pressure drop, but not so low as to trip the oil level sensor. </p>

<p>Also, I see reports online of 10W oil being too heavy for temps below 0º F, and we've been having sustained temps below -10º F for the past week. However I've been driving my car every day during that time period, future readers of this may not be.</p>

<p>I may switch to 5W-30 after some research, even if it's just for this one oil change.</p>

<p>Some people claim that multi-link setups are more forgiving when driving over bumpy surfaces, and I have no reason to argue with them, but I personally believe that has more to do with relative spring and compression rates as well as shock absorber type than anything else.

","<p>Checking several on line vendors specs the 40mm or 60mm refers to the amount of lowering from stock. If your stock spring leaves 100mm of tire clearance a 40mm spring would leave 60 mm of clearance. Several things must be taken into account prior to selecting your springs. Your car may already be lower than stock due to the age and condition of the springs. The 40mm drop is from a new stock spring. If you add non stock tires and wheels the clearance will change. If you haven't done so recently I would suggest getting new struts as a leading cause of spring failure is worn struts. You will also need a front end alignment after installing the springs.  </p>

<p>A few months ago, I began to hear a noise that sounds similar to a diesel engine, which begins a few seconds after starting the cold engine. Once warmed up, or as soon as driving or revving, the noise goes away completely. An M4A sound file is linked under <strong>What</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Why</strong>:
I'd love to know</p>

<p>Through forums, I've seen many different hypothesis as to what it might be, none of which seem to fit:</p>

<ul>
<li>Piston slap - I imagine this would occur all the time, in the first
few seconds after starting, and get worse with revving. I haven't removed the oil pan to check for skirt fragments, but have taken a magnet to it to listen for pieces that might ""snap"" to it.</li>
<li>Loose flex plate bolts / cracks - all bolts were torqued, no visible cracks on inspection</li>
<li>Stuck/clogged lifter - I pulled the valve cover and looked for rods that weren't delivering oil, loose rockers. All appeared OK, bolts were still torqued. I would expect this to also make noise as soon as I start the engine, or while revving, before warm.</li>
<li>Spun bearing - I haven't removed the oil pan to check - but imagine if this was the issue, she would have broken down since I first posted this.</li>
<li>Dirty oil - Ran sea foam in the oil for ~100 mi, changed previous full synth out @ 3k mi (came out like midnight), replaced with full synthetic, Valvoline Maxlife 10w-30 subbing 1 qt with Marvel Mystery Oil (though I always used Castrol GTX high-mileage before this and the last change).</li>
</ul>

<p>Other observations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Intermittently, a few seconds after starting, the engine will ""moan"" for a second or two. I've caught this about 3 times in the past few weeks. Serpentine belt is def a bit loose, will squelch if revved immediately after starting</li>
<li>Tach quivers during idle, engine appears to miss intermittently. (this has been ongoing)</li>
<li><a href=""https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/23020/hard-cold-starts-only"">Hard starts</a> when engine is cold. (This was addressed in another question, but returned)</li>
<li>Oil pressure varies greatly. Needle moves a bit during idle at around 20, stays steady around 50 while driving. This used to jump, or not register at all until I wiggled the engine sensor.</li>
<li>Radio head unit illumination will go out intermittently. Punching it temporarily fixes it and relieves stress.</li>
</ul>

<p>UPDATE: Oil was a quart low at the last change (3k mi)</p>

<p>UPDATE: <strong>It appears that with the cold weather (it's 40F out atm), the noise has disappeared</strong>. Possibly unrelated: CEL light went on, and back off - transmission malfunction codes were thrown, noting shift solenoid B (gears 2/3). Higher RPMs were required to get the vehicle moving, intermittently, but has since gone away.</p>
","<p>Knocking sounds reflect worn out parts, which had got so much tolerance than oil can't fill the gap any longer. It could also be the oil itself, being to thin or too old (and got thinner). If the noise is only in the bottom then it could be the bearings in the crankshaft, or the displacement bush also in the crankshaft at the extremes of it. However a ""diesel engine"" kind of rhythmical continual tapping noise is typical heard when the valves or the camshaft are worn, or there is too much valve clearance. If the engine has oil plunges to move the valves, one of them may be getting ""lazy"" </p>

<p>I was on my way home from a meeting today, and I was driving down a road.  The radio went off, and all of the sudden, all of the lights on the dash lit up: check engine, parking break, etc.  I didn't have any turn signals, the power windows/locks didn't work, etc. </p>

<p>Since I already had the vehicle on, I drove it right to the the dealer, who got it right in.  Once I turned the engine off at the dealer, the car wouldn't start, and everything was dead in the water.  </p>

<p>First they checked the battery, which was fine (I had it replaced in January...by the dealer!).  Then they thought the issue could be the starter or possibly how the after market remote starter (which was installed by the dealer) was interacting with the starter.  That wasn't the problem.  So this afternoon, they said that they ran every diagnostic possible on it, and they <em>think</em> that the problem is the engine harness.  They said that the entire engine harness had to go, and that there probably is a sensor involved here as well.  The total price of the estimated fix is $2800, which is a pretty large amount to risk, especially given that:</p>

<ol>
<li>I've got no guarantee that replacing the engine harness would do the job, and</li>
<li>I've lost my faith in the dealer's competence.  We're talking about 4 different dealers in 4 major U.S. cities that I've worked with for maintenance, so I don't think that going to a different one would solve the problem.  </li>
</ol>

<p>My question: What are some possible reasons that my car would have suddenly just died it did? </p>
","<p>Unless the harness is damaged, the problem is most likely to be amongst the engine ECU, immobiliser transponder, or instrument panel control module. Prelimanary checks should be fuses, relays, and connecting plugs correctly fitted. Don't be too hard on the techs involved as a fault of this type can be a long and drawn out affair, but could be simply a fuse or relay replacement. The engine ECU powers the actuators on the vehicle, so you need to check things like: fuel pump runs when ignition key is turned to the run position, power to injectors, power to ignition coils, brake lights working. These checks will show that the ECU is or is'nt working. </p>

"How does the heater core work?","6069","","<p>How does the heater core work? </p>

<p>What are the inputs to the system?</p>

<p>What are the outputs of the system?</p>

<p>What are some common ways that it can fail?</p>
","<p>The heater core is part of continuous loop of engine coolant propelled via the water pump, flowing through caverns in the engine, through pipes that run through the firewall into the heater core, back out the firewall, and finally through the radiator. If the thermostat dictates it (due to a temperature limit being reached), the fan blows air over the radiator to cool it.</p>

<p>Since the liquid flowing in and out of the heater core is constantly heated by the engine, the only other component necessary to produce heat is a fan blowing air through the heater core (much like the radiator, except the air enters the cabin.)</p>

<p>So, what can go wrong:</p>

<ul>
<li>No Coolant in the system</li>
<li>A broken loop. This can be a broken/leaking rubber hose, or a crack in any component, but in the end, presents itself as a lack of coolant in the system.</li>
<li>Lack of flow through the system. If the liquid in the heater core stagnates, it will eventually become too cool to produce a sufficient amount of heat. This is usually due to a bad water pump. I've seen factory pumps made out of plastic; the fins on these tend to get dissolved by certain types of coolant over time until all you have left is a cylinder with dimples.</li>
<li>Faulty thermostat. An engine has an optimum temperature to be operating at. It certainly should not get too hot, but it also should not run cold; it is much more efficient once ""warmed up"". To faciliate staying at the same temperature, a thermostat opens or closes to let coolant flow. If stuck open, it cools the engine too much. As a by-product, the heater (which also draws heat from the hot coolant) suffers.</li>
<li>No air flow through heater core (bad heater blower fan)</li>
<li>Air flow through heater core, but not into cabin. Bad vacuum lines, broken or jammed circulation doors. In this case, the liquid's hot, the heater fan is working, but the air can't get into the interior of the car because it is physically being stopped by a blend door that's supposed to be open.</li>

<ol>
<li>I've changed the fuel filter.</li>
<li>The battery is brand new.</li>
</ol>

<p>Should I check the spark plugs, air filter?<br>
Or does anyone know that whether it has a fuel pump (can't seem to find this answer on the web).</p>
","<p>As with all engines, you need spark, fuel and compression. If all three are present it will run, if any are missing it won't.</p>

<p>When you try to start the engine, does it turn over at normal speed, as if it is trying to start, or does it spin a lot faster or slower than you might expect? If it is a lot faster, you may have low compression. If it is a lot slower, your starter motor is probably suspect (assuming it has a starter motor and isn't a pull-start like smaller mower engines).</p>

<p>Assuming you have good compression and the engine is turning at a good speed, the next thing to check is the spark. Take one plug out and check its colour against a colour chart*- this can often tell you a lot about what is going on. At this point, it is usually wise to check the plug gaps - you'll need a feeler gauge and the mower's workshop manual for the correct values. If the plug looks good, connect the plug to its lead, and lay it on top the engine so the body of the plug is earthed, then try starting and watch the plug - you should see a spark. If you don't, or it looks weak, that is the problem. If you get a good spark, replace the plug, re-gap the others, and move on to fuel...</p>

<p>Unless it is gravity-fed, there will have to be some kind of fuel pump somewhere in the system. A quick way to test this is to get a can of ""easy-start"" or similar. Remove the air filter, and (working in a well ventilated area) spray the easy-start directly into the intake, then try to start the engine - if it coughs, then fuel supply is the likely problem. If you've checked the fuel filter, then it is either a failed pump or a blockage in the line. Disconnect the inlet to the pump, and pop the end of it into a can of fuel (being careful, petrol vapour is highly flammable!), then try to start - being in mind will take longer than normal to suck the fuel through. If that works, it is a blockage in the line (or the fuel in the tank is crap). If not, remove the pump and test it off the engine. </p>

<li>Oil changes regularly</li>
<li>Brake pads are also replaced recently (within 6 months)</li>
<li>I already had 30k maintenance</li>
</ul>

<p>So given this, what would be the most cost-effective set of maintenance services for 60k miles?</p>
","<p>Generally speaking, the dealer should be able to adjust the cost to only perform maintenance on items that are actually needed. They should check the coolant, and other fluids, and only recommend replacing what needs to be replaced.</p>

<p>The brake pads may have been replaced already, but the fluid does need to be flushed and replaced every few years, regardless of mileage. Spark plugs probably do not need replaced, until 100K miles. If they do need replaced, then it's probably a good sign that something else is out of normal operating parameters for the engine as well. The coolant system also needs a flush and fill every few years. If you've got an automatic transmission, it might also be the right time for it to be flushed and replaced as well.</p>

<p>Battery and alternator are also good things to have checked at this time. They don't last forever, and if the battery has not yet been replaced in the car, it might be getting close to needing replacement as well.</p>

<p>Suspension components may have worn down as well and should be inspected. Bearings, hubs, and ball joints may need replaced, depending on how it's been driven for those 60K miles, and on what types of roads, and such.</p>

<p>The 60K recommended service is recommended for good reason. The actions specified in the service should be performed.</p>

"How do variable-length intake manifolds work?","6049","","<p>I have heard many vehicle manufacturers have been using this to improve power and torque figures.</p>

<p>They do this by altering the length of the manifold, I am hoping for better diagrammatic explanation.</p>
","<p>The length of the intake runners have certain affects on the engine operation. For example, longer intake runners are used to improve the bottom end torque (torque at low RPMs) while shorter intake runners will improve top end power (horsepower at high RPMs). The lengths will vary from engine to engine as well as what the goals of each vehicle the engine will be powering.</p>

<p>You also have to take into account the diameter of each runner. Everything correlates to mass and velocity of airflow. Through the RPM range the velocity of airflow in the runners increases, but at some point, it maxes out and cannot go any faster which will be limiting. As the velocity of the airflow increases, so does it's inertia. At the bottom of the intake stroke, the inertia of the airflow will help push a little more air into the cylinder which will help power. But, if the runner isn't optimal, that can't happen.</p>

<p>For example, a long, smaller diameter runner will help low end torque because it will hit the velocity limit earlier, but it will hurt top end horsepower because it's too restrictive. A short, large diameter runner will help top end power because it will reach maximum velocity later, but it will not help low end torque because it cannot get enough velocity to build inertia.</p>

<p>Now that you know what the differences between the runner lengths are, you can imagine why having a variable length runner manifold would be a good idea. You get the best of both worlds. With a normal manifold, you have to pick the exact manifold for whatever your goals are. If you plan to do a lot of drag racing, then probably a manifold with runners to support top-end power would be best where as if you're doing autocross where you're down in the low-end RPM range most of the time, you might choose a manifold to best improve low end torque. It all varies and there is no right or wrong answer for all applications. But there is going to be a compromise. </p>

<p>For the regular daily driver though, you don't want to compromise because you need the low end torque for driving around stop light to stop light, but also you need that power on top for merging on the freeway or passing someone.</p>

<p>The variable length runner manifolds use a valve to switch back and forth between two runners depending on what the situation calls for. When the engine load is high (low RPM), the manifold will switch to use a longer, smaller runner to get the low end torque. When the engine load is low (high RPM), the manifold will switch to use a shorter, bigger runner to help with power on top. The best of both worlds.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This is a simplified explanation of intake manifolds and runners. There is a whole world of science out there between surge tanks, more airflow dynamics like turbulence, swirl, etc and of course when it comes to forced induction engines (turbo, super chargers), these rules change.</p>

<p>You can see as described in one of the comments, there is a shaft that controls a set of butterflys. The shaft will rotate which will re-position the butterflys effectively changing the runner properties.

"When is a cold air intake system beneficial?","6026","","<p>Cold air intake must be one of the popular mods there is, and one subject to the most controversy as well. Manufacturers of such systems advertise 5-20 HP gains, yet there are claims that this mod does nothing and may even hurt performance (even tests with videos can be found online).</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZoS8E.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZoS8E.jpg"" alt=""Do you really need this?""></a></p>

<p>As I see it the stock setup of most cars already contains a ""cold air intake"", since the factory airbox usually sucks air from an area remote from the hot components, like the fender or bumper. </p>

<p>So what's the point of adding a cold air intake system to your car? Is the only point to reduce the air intake restriction by adding a gauze/foam filter, and since the airbox has to be removed, piping and heatshields are added to draw cooler air and prevent power loss? Does this mod ever give a measurable increase in power?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Does this mod ever give a measurable increase in power?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>tl;dr: yes, sometimes it works well. But...</strong></p>

<p>Your picture is a good illustration of some of the problems with just saying ""cold air intake"" and expecting that to mean the same thing to all people.  Let's break down the pieces of the puzzle and talk about how those might help or hurt:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Filter</em>: notice that the filter in the picture is not a panel filter as many of us have in the airbox. If that filter is less restrictive than stock, that will certainly impede the intake's job of getting air molecules into the system less. However, is it still filtering out hazards to the motor?  Is it an oiled filter?  Will that oil get onto the mass airflow sensor?</li>
<li><em>Piping</em>: the actual path that the air takes is definitely important. Is this piping better at thermal isolation?  The engine bay is hot and hot intake air means less performance. Is the piping less restrictive?  Does the air flow better?  Does it flow too well (causing a lean condition)?</li>
<li><em>Location</em>: the intake in the picture appears to be a short ram intake. That means that it only reaches to the standard location of the airbox. Will it be drawing air directly from the hot engine bay?  Or is there another path for cooler air to reach the intake?  Would it get cooler air sucking from directly in the wheel well?  Of course, then you run the risk of sucking up water in a heavy rain....</li>
</ol>

<p>In theory, the engine is an air pump. If the intake can reduce restrictions and pumping losses, it's all good, right?  Unfortunately, even in the theoretical world, freeing the intake isn't going to solve a restrictive exhaust (can't get the air out as fast as we can get it in).  </p>

<p>Let's talk two practical examples using my cars:</p>

<ol>
<li>1997 Acura Integra NA 4 cylinder. I tried two different cold air intakes on that car. Both of them seemed to make the car happier (subjective assessment based on a nicer sound). However, the power increases weren't really significant until I had replaced the headers and the exhaust system with stainless steel. The car sounded great, revved well and had a lot more pickup. There was every reason to believe that I'd removed several restrictions on a car that had originally prioritized quiet over fun. However, I'd also removed a lot of weight of metal by switching to stainless (those iron headers were <em>heavy</em>). In this case, the CAI was part of the picture but not the biggest part. </li>
<li>2004 Subaru WRX Turbo 4 cylinder. This car has a reputation for ignoring CAI changes without a retune. The ECU simply recalibrates to match the increase in airflow, resulting in no increase in power. There's also a risk of damage to the MAF using oiled filters. There's also the reality that I don't need to worry about the same intake restrictions that I had on the Acura: I'm not just hoping air wanders into the engine with a turbo in the mix!  With this car, the recommended change is a less restrictive panel filter that drops in place of the stock. </li>
</ol>

<p>So, where does this leave us?</p>

<ol>
<li>A CAI has a good chance of sounding cooler than a stock intake. It will definitely be louder. </li>
<li>A CAI will reduce restrictions in the intake path. That might lead to more power out of the box. It might not. It might lead to engine damage. Caveat emptor. </li>
<li>A CAI may increase risk of water ingestion. This may lead to hydrolock (a broken engine and many tears). </li>
</ol>

<p>In short, like all things car related, it depends.  On an older car with a weedy intake and hot under hood temperatures, I would certainly try a CAI. On a modern car, I don't bother. </p>

"Tubeless Bead Won't Seat","6025","","<p>In attempting to mount a motorcycle tire, I was unable to properly seat the beads. While the tire inflated and held air pressure, it failed to easily seat across identical points on both sidewalls. When I did eventually get the first, the second side continued to be troublesome. Before the first bead set, that area of the tire was hard to compress together. It seemed that the beads stayed close together there. Rotating the tire on the rim showed that it was the same spot on the tire that was always affected rather than a spot on the rim. The following were tried:</p>

<ul>
<li>Various inflation and deflation attempts.</li>
<li>Lots of Windex.</li>
<li>Moderate amounts of dish-soap-like tire lube.</li>
<li>Spooning the tire completely off the rim, then back on it.</li>
<li>Hitting the inflated tire with a hammer.</li>
<li>Bouncing the tire off the ground when inflated and when deflated.</li>
<li>Leaving it sitting overnight with up to 70psi in the tire.</li>
</ul>

<p>One bead finally popped on at 80psi after the first 2 hours of effort -- and the shockwave made me temporarily deaf.  Since then, I kept it to 70psi or lower. I worked on it for a total of five hours. I finally gave up and brought it to a friend's shop. I believe he pumped it up to the full pressure of the shop compressor: over 130 psi. He also tried the hammer trick and some spray-on tire lube. We finally seated the second bead with 60psi and bearing grease on about half the rim.</p>

<p>Are there better approaches to this madness? A certain kind of tire lubricant that will works best? I know the catch with the grease is that it won't dry and will remain in a lubricating state until I clean the rim for mounting the next time -- though I really doubt that damn thing will actually spin on the rim.</p>
","<p>Well, after some further experience with tire changing, I've come to find that using a proper lubricant was the way to solve things. While bearing grease worked to seat the tire, there are some reasons that it isn't ideal. <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000CIJUGK"" rel=""nofollow"">Ruglyde</a> has since worked very well for me, and being a proper tire lubricant will dry, thus not leaving the same risk of spinning the rim that a regular grease could pose.</p>

You may have to try several size screwdrivers to find a size that is small enough fit in the gap and large enough to pry with.

"P0420 in a Prius","6013","","<p>EDIT #2: I rescanned, looking at the correct data, and found the rear O2 sensor was definitely bouncing up and down with the forward sensor's lambda reading.  Since I have looked for leaks and couldn't find any, I decided to just go for a new catalytic converter.  I have read that you can use propane to create a rich condition and a vacuum leak to force a lean condition, and this is a more thorough test to make sure your sensors are working properly, but the rear O2 sensor moving with the forward, and not having any leaks, I feel confident enough that this really is a bad cat.  I'm going to replace it myself, and I'll make sure to post the results.  I do wish I knew more about why the cat went bad, as I understand there may be an underlying problem, and even if a new cat fixes the code, it may go bad quickly due to the underlying issue.  But then, the car has 170000 miles, so it's surpassed its life expectancy.</p>

<p>EDIT: the red/blue plots are Fuel/Air Commanded Equivalence Ratio.  I think I need to put this on hold and get more info, but I don't know how...</p>

<p>My 2005 Prius is throwing a P0420 code (catalytic converter).
I just got a scan tool that works on my phone, and got the two plots below.</p>

<p>In the first picture, I was coasting (which shuts the engine off) then I hit the throttle, momentarily, then coasted again.  I'm noticing that when the engine goes off and starts up again (green upper-left RPM plot), the o2 sensor readings (big plot with red upstream and blue downstream) go nuts.  Is this normal?</p>

<p>In the second picture, I took my foot off the throttle, let the RPMs drop (but the engine didn't stop) and then hit the throttle.  You can see that under normal conditions the o2 sensor is fine (red wobbles up and down, blue is mostly constant), but then I hit the throttle (RPM's pick way up) and the readings of the o2 sensors move quite drastically.</p>

<p>The catalytic converter code was cleared and the test passed (an Evap test is still pending) but I've cleared the code many times, no luck.  I have tried the magic bottle of cat cleaner, followed the instructions closely, but it didn't help.  Now that I can read codes and plot sensors, I'm hoping to diagnose the problem instead of just throwing stuff at it.</p>

<p>Also, everything I read says o2 sensors operate around .7 volt, but mine seem to center around 1V.  Is my car just different?  Could it be the Dash Command software not interpreting the data properly?</p>

<p>I can add any additional test conditions anyone asks for in the comments, and would like to say thanks in advance, I know how smart and talented this community is.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HfVmM.jpg"" alt=""O2 Sensors""></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9soPI.jpg"" alt=""o2 Sensors""></p>
","<p>Okay, I fixed it.</p>

<p>Turns out, I had a bad catalytic converter and I was reading the wrong thing in my original post.  I identified the bad cat by looking at the correct sensor data.  The data posted (red and blue) is the lambda measurement, which is a derived (not actual) measurement.  It's useful for the forward A/F, but useless (as far as I have seen) for the downstream O2 sensor.  The reason it fluctuates around 1 instead of the usual .7 volts is because it is a ratio that, by definition, hangs out around 1...  So that answers that part.  (Note that the A/F sensor stays closer to 3.2 volts or something like that if you choose to read the actual A/F sensor voltage instead of the lambda reading).</p>

<p>Before the repair, when I looked at the rear o2 sensor readings (which centered around .7 volts), they were wildly swinging up and down with the A/F's lambda reading.  This is an indication that the catalytic converter might be bad (though, I recommend doing a bunch of reading and testing before drawing your own conclusions, because there can be other issues that cause similar signs; e.g. I had a bad exhaust gasket on a Tacoma and it threw a P0420 code.  The o2 sensor was swinging up and down, though probably not as tightly correlated as this one was with the front sensor.  $20 gasket and some grinding was a lot less painful than a new cat, and it fixed the problem. YMMV).</p>

<p>I ordered an aftermarket cat from Advanced Auto Parts; make sure to use the 20% off code (they always have one going) and they shipped it free to my door ($240 total for the cat).  I had to cut the pipe at the correct place with a hack saw (I actually cut so I'd have extra, and then cut again for an exact fit; the fit of old vs new was exact enough that I could have measured and made one cut, but I didn't want to risk coming up short, and it's a complex shape to be certain it will line up just the same).  I clamped the pipes together with a piece of tube that came with the cat, and that sealed it/made it permanent (big U clamp with nuts to tighten a cross-member).  After a little smoke as the new cat sort of burned in (during which the rear O2 sensor was swinging up and down and my heart was sinking; this took about 10 minutes), finally the rear o2 reading steadied and has held ever since.  </p>

<p>Also of note: I tried an aftermarket flange gasket, and it didn't work, it was too small and wouldn't go on.  The flange was 2.4 inches across, and the after market gasket was 2.3 inches ID.  I went OEM so I could get the car back together with no further delays ($52 from Toyota, ouch!).  Of course the OEM part fit perfectly.  Also, my spring-bolts were in perfect shape, and I reused them (which is shocking for a 10 year old exhaust part to not be rusted out in New England).  That saved me from having to get new hardware.</p>

<p>Of interest, when watching the downflow O2 sensor on a Prius, it will drop down to almost 0 when the engine stops or is braking (no fuel, so it shows lot of oxygen, which looks like a very lean condition on an o2 sensor).  It's tough to get a good measurement over a long period of time, because the sensor drops down all the time, and then kicks in when the engine kicks in, then steadies, then falls as you coast and stop producing power with the engine.  I took the car to a hill, just to make absolutely sure it was working right, and laid on the engine for a good minute, with the o2 sensor reading staying steady.  I'll report back if I find anything else, but it looks really good so far.</p>

<p>Also, I have before/after data (logged sensor data).  I'd be willing to post it here for future reference, but I'm not sure how to attach a data file.</p>

","<p>They are exactly what you stated: wheel weights. They are used to balance the tire so when you are going down the road you don't get an out of balance condition. These are VERY important for several reasons.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ride Comfort: If a wheel/tire is not balanced correctly, it will cause a vibration through the vehicle which is really unnerving as you drive.</li>
<li>Safety: With a wheel being out of balance and causing the vibration, your tire may not maintain constant contact with the road (yes, they can bounce that much). This can become problematic during the need to brake and corner, plus the basic control of the vehicle suffers.</li>
<li>Vehicle Wear: When a tire is out of balance and is vibrating, there becomes an issue with wear on the suspension components which do their best to dampen the vibration. Since the vibration is unnatural, this causes extra wear on the shock/strut, suspension bushings, steering components, tire and other things.</li>
</ul>

<p>As pointed out, those little weights are important. While it may have been causing the slow leak, the real fix should be to re-seat the tire on the rim and then re-balance it.</p>

A lot of casual car-owners I ask don't even know about the engine air filter replacement. Gas mileage and power seem likely to decrease with a clogged air filter, but why is not replacing also bad for the car (please be as specific as possible)?</p>
","<p>There are two major problems incurred by not changing your air filter:</p>

<ol>
<li>As your air filter becomes full of dirt, pollen, <em>crap</em>, what have you, it becomes a restriction on the air inlet. This will <strong>degrade performance</strong> on the vehicle (as you stated). This will cause you more wear and tear on the engine (having to push the engine harder for it to make up the difference). This isn't a thing you'd notice right away, but rather something which would take effect over a long period of time.</li>
<li>As the filter becomes saturated as stated above, it will only be able to hold so much. When it gets to a certain point, new dirt will start pushing old dirt through, which gets inside the engine. This <strong>creates more wear and tear</strong> on the engine, which means its useful life is shortened. Also consider, if a filter becomes so saturated to the point the restriction is great, the filter can deform due to the pressure differential, which could allow completely unfiltered air to enter the engine. This would cause a lot of damage over time. If you don't change out your filter regularly, you'd never notice this and could be causing your engine an untold amount of damage. </li>
</ol>

<p>Changing out the air filter will save you time, money, and wear on vital engine components. If you treat your car nicely over the life of it, it will pay you back in dividends by lasting longer and saving you money. Same goes for any type of regular maintenance you should be doing.</p>

A broken alternator belt would allow the engine to run until the battery gets so low it can't power the needed systems such as fuel pump,ignition, computers etc. At this point it would stop. You need to tell us what you have checked, what you are capable of checking and any visual clues such as the belts are in place, the battery has 12v etc. If nothing is working you need to start with the battery. Does any thing work if you attach jumper cables? </p>

"Windshield wipers stop and motor makes noise","5977","","<p>I was driving my 2003 Toyota Camry LE today (while it was snowing) and I had my windshield wipers going at full. All of a sudden the windshield wipers stopped in the middle of a wipe and it started making a noise. After I stopped, I forced the windshield wipers back down (I pushed them down a bit while the car was on and it automatically pushed them down). When they're stuck they can go back up but stop trying to go back down. I'm wondering what the problem might be? Could it be the motor has gone on it? Or, could it be from the snow or from having it on full blast? Also, if it is the motor, can someone elaborate on where the motor is located?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> After a few hours, I finally got the windshield wiper motor replaced and now it works no problem.</p>
","<p>It sounds to me that the gear(s) in the motor are partially stripped. When the wipers go up, it hits the place where the teeth are gone. When you pushed it back down manually, it caught a place where the teeth are still present and brought them back down. The only way you can check this is by extracting the motor and pulling the gears apart to check. Any way you look at it, the problem most likely resides with the motor. Linkages go bad, but usually this occurs at the joints where sacrificial grommets wear out and the ends pop off (no wiper action at all and you can physically move either one or both of the wipers by hand) or leave a lot of slop in the wipers (lots of clunking going on, but the wipers still go back and forth). </p>

<p>I looked at a video on YouTube, but could not discern where the motor is accessible at, though it should be on the driver's side of the vehicle at the base of the windshield. I would either be under the cowling (plastic piece which the base of the wipers goes through) or through the engine compartment via an access panel. (I will look and update this evening at my mo-in-law's car, as she owns one which I believe is the same year as yours).</p>

"Ford Transit not going into 1st gear easily","5974","","<p>With a lot of Googling I've found loads of different things that could be causing this - and none for a Ford Transit so I hope someone can explain exactly what is causing this problem, and from the mechanical side, what is actually physically happening, (and how the mechanism actually works).</p>

<p>Often when I try to go into first gear, the stick does not go all the way in, and it makes a grinding sound. It seems worse when the van is at a stand still - it goes in far more easily when the van is rolling slightly (a few mph). If I depress and repress the clutch, sometimes it goes in, but can take 3-4 attempts at times. The reverse gear has the same problem, but I have not tried it while rolling forward or backwards, since it's not all that easy!</p>

<p>The model is a 2005 2.0L Diesel SWB. </p>

<p>What part is likely to be needing repair? Perhaps someone can give a link to an example part? For example:</p>

</ul>

<p>Thanks</p>
","<p>This could be the clutch as you seem to suspect. The effect of the clutch not separating the engine from the gearbox fully is that the input shaft never stops rotating when in neutral. If you have noticed the clutch pedal not releasing as high as before, this is likely. If it's the synchronizer that's bad, moving into second gear and then first should help. (As that will stop the input shaft completely to match the output shaft)</p>

<p>A clutch that does not fully disengage can be caused by different things. If it is a mechanical linkage, it might need adjustment. I think yours is hydraulic though, in that case you might want to check your fluid level and make sure no air is in the system or leaks is apparent in the master or slave cylinder. Bleed it and see if there's a change.</p>

<p>If it's not the hudraulics, it's likely mechanical and you would have to remove the gearbox to fix it.</p>

"How much coolant does a 98 Subaru Forester hold?","5971","","<p>I'm looking to put an additive in my forester's cooling system, I'm not sure where to find out this information.</p>
","<p>Either the owner's manual or a repair manual will give you this information.</p>

<p>I happen to have an owner's manual for a '98 Forester, and the value given there is 6.2ℓ, or 6.6 U.S. quarts. The factory service manual for a 2000 Forester gives 6.0ℓ, or 6.3 U.S. quarts. It's possible that the owner's manual value includes the coolant in the reservoir (that's the plastic bottle hanging off the back of the radiator with a vinyl tube running into it from just below the radiator cap).</p>

<p>In any case, the value should be in the vicinity of 6ℓ for any Forester up to '05 or '06 (at least the non-turbos); the engine remained essentially the same over that span, to my knowledge.</p>

"Why not use gasoline on diesel engines or vice versa?","5958","","<p>I've read gasoline engines use sparks to ignite the mixture, but diesel engines use just compression which can't be done in gasoline engines due to high compression ratios which can cause engine knocking, but if that was true gasoline? It can then be put in diesel engines and will ignite properly because diesel engines have high compression ratios, so why can't this be done?</p>

<p>And also diesel can be put in gasoline engines since they have a lower autoignition point? </p>
","<p>You can run gasoline in a diesel motor, but it causes problems. As mentioned elsewhere, when you compress the fuel/air mixture enough, it gets really hot then ignites. With diesel, this is ok, because the fuel burns (relatively) slowly, so it doesn't need to be timed very well.</p>

<p>Gasoline, on the other hand, burns really fast. If you consistently ignite the fuel a little too early, you'll blow holes in your pistons, break piston rings, break connecting rods, shatter crankshafts, blow head gaskets, etc. If you ignite it just a little too late, it won't ignite at all.</p>

<p>The timing is based on the heat inside the combustion chamber, which changes constantly. So it's much harder to get the perfect timing. Even if it doesn't damage anything (diesel engines are much sturdier than a similar gasoline engine), the early ignition means your flame front is working against the piston for the last few degrees and wastes a significant amount of energy. You could probably put knock sensors in the head and add extra fuel to keep the temperature down, but that would be much harder on the conventional carbureted engines that got the current design started.*</p>

<p>Similarly, you can run diesel in a gasoline motor, but it's not very efficient (if you can keep it running at all). The high compression of a diesel motor helps the diesel fuel burn better (diesel is hard to burn), and the high compression of the injection pumps helps vaporize the fuel (if you pour it down the intake it tends to stay in liquid form which doesn't burn well). Without those things, you're only going to extract a fraction of the available power from the fuel.</p>

<p>.* Note that this is a large part of the answer: Just because we can do something now with modern technology doesn't mean they could a hundred years ago. Now that we have a hundred odd years doing it one way, there's no reason to make radical changes now without a significant advantage to using the new method.</p>

"Repair or replace frayed fuel injection wiring harness?","5941","","<p>This is on a 2008 Chevy Impala, 3.5L V6, non-flexfuel.  Recently got cylinder 1 misfire / ignition failure codes.  An investigation revealed that mice had gotten into my garage, made themselves at home under the lower intake manifold, and chewed the wires going to the cylinder 1 fuel injector to pieces.  The rest of the injectors are fine.</p>

<p>If this were some other kind of electronic device I wouldn't hesitate to cut out the bad portion, solder in a new bit of wire, and close up it all up with shrink-wrap...  but I'm not 100% certain this would be a good idea in this situation.  So my questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Can I patch in new wires to replace the part that has been ruined, or should I replace the entire wiring harness?</strong> (there is still enough good wire between the connector and where the wire branches off from the main harness that I think I could do it)</li>
<li>If I can, do I need to make special allowances for the potentially high-heat environment?  Do I need wires with heat-resistant insulation?  Should I avoid shrink wrap?  Use different electrical tape (or no tape)?</li>
<li>Do I need to replace the upper intake manifold gaskets while I'm there?  The car has about 95K on it and the gaskets look like they're in good condition (no idea if they've ever been done), but maybe it's a good idea to replace since I've gone through the effort of removing the manifold?</li>
<li>Any other gaskets, o-rings, etc, that I should look at or replace while I've got the top off?</li>
<li>I'm having a heck of a time disconnecting the wiring from the injector.  Is there a trick I'm missing?</li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks all!</p>
","<p>Just replace the injector plug. I believe it should look like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UeMrS.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>You can order it from RockAuto.com for ~$6 (I'm sure you can get it from many other places as well. I would soldier this in place using heat shrink to seal them up. </p>

<p>As far as the gaskets go, your vehicle uses the gaskets with the rubber-ish sealing portion (don't know what they are made out of). You can chance using them again if the rubber portion is not torn nor hard. It must be subtle and pliable to do this though. Personally, I think I'd spring for the extra $26 and put new ones in there. Better to get it done right in the first place then having to redo the job. </p>

<p>If you took the manifold off without breaking any other gaskets or o-rings, I wouldn't worry about them. If you have broken them loose, I'd plan on getting them replaced along with the manifold gasket. When I take a manifold off of the heads, I try my darnedest to keep everything together that I can for two reasons: less nuts/bolts to keep track of; easier to get everything back together.</p>

<p>I personally have not taken this type off connector off of an injector before, so your guess is as good as mine. Once you get the new connector, it should be very self evident as to how to pull it off. I do know they can be a bugger, but usually it isn't too hard. Don't force it off, though, as you'll end up breaking an injector and that'll cost you another $50-60 to replace.</p>

<p>As an aside, if you are going to leave your car sit for a length of time in the garage, put a couple of dryer sheets in strategic places under the hood. Mice don't like the smell, I understand, and will leave your wiring alone.</p>

","<p>Sounds to me like your starter motor is on the way out, as you are getting enough power, as a bump start is working, and sometimes you are able to start normally.</p>

<p>This isn't that uncommon - they do take a lot of stress and load, and the internal friction can end up being too high for them to cope with.</p>

"What are the tell tale signs of a catalytic converter that might be going bad?","5927","","<p>I've owned two vehicles whose catalytic converters were recalled due two a couple of reasons: one being the quality of the CC and the other being a reduction in power due to a material building up and reducing airflow.</p>

<li>If the cat rattles (may happen more after warmed up), then it's definitely bad. Banging on it can help see if there is material loose in there.</li>
<li>If the cat was plugged up enough to affect performance, I would hope that one of the 02 sensors would kick off the check engine light. However, if it's borderline, I guess the engine may be able to adjust the fuel levels enough to make itself happy without adjusting enough to trip the CEL.</li>
<li>To really and truly know, you'd have to check the back pressure ahead of the cat and compare it against factory specs. I've never had to actually do that though. Anytime I've had a cat plugged so bad that it affected performance, it caused the vehicle to outright misfire.</li>
</ul>

<p>All that being said, ""I feel that sometimes I have less power than I'm supposed to have"" is a really broad statement. Most things that affect performance on a modern car (enough to be noticeable) should trip the Check Engine Light and give you a place to begin troubleshooting. </p>
