"How many squares actually ARE in this picture? Is this a trick question with no right answer?","582448","","<p>This is one of those popular pictures on sites like Facebook. I always see a huge variation of answers such as $8, 9, 16, 17, 24, 28, 30, 40, 41, 52,$ etc., yet I've never seen a definitive answer on any website.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SM0I2.jpg"" alt=""Squares image""></p>

<p>I counted $16$ whole squares ($4$ going down on left side, $4$ going down on right side, $8$ small squares in the centre). With this method the answer could also be $17$ if you want to count the entire shape as one big square.</p>

<p>I can also see the answer being $24$ if you count the smaller squares separately, as if they were floating above the main grid instead of intersecting with it.</p>

<p>Is there a right answer, or is it possible that there is no 'right' answer and it just depends on your counting method?</p>

","<p>As Willie Wong observed, including an expression of the form $\displaystyle \frac{|\alpha|}{\alpha}$ is a way of ensuring that $\alpha &gt; 0$. (As $\sqrt{|\alpha|/\alpha}$ is $1$ if $\alpha &gt; 0$ and non-real if $\alpha &lt; 0$.)</p>

<p>This is got by adding $y = \left| \frac{x}{2} \right| - \frac{\left( 3\sqrt{33}-7 \right)}{112}x^{2} - 3$, a parabola on the positive-x side, reflected:</p>

<p>The third factor $9\sqrt{\frac{\left( \left| \left( 1-\left| x \right| \right)\left( \left| x \right|-.75 \right) \right| \right)}{\left( 1-\left| x \right| \right)\left( \left| x \right|-.75 \right)}}\; -\; 8\left| x \right|\; -\; y\; =\; 0$ is just the pair of lines y = 9 - 8|x|:</p>

<p>truncated to the region $0.75 &lt; |x| &lt; 1$.</p>

<p>Similarly, the fourth factor $3\left| x \right|\; +\; .75\sqrt{\left( \frac{\left| \left( .75-\left| x \right| \right)\left( \left| x \right|-.5 \right) \right|}{\left( .75-\left| x \right| \right)\left( \left| x \right|-.5 \right)} \right)}\; -\; y\; =\; 0$ is the pair of lines $y = 3|x| + 0.75$:</p>

<p>truncated to the region $0.5 &lt; |x| &lt; 0.75$.</p>

<hr>

<p>Finally, $\frac{6\sqrt{10}}{7}\; +\; \left( 1.5\; -\; .5\left| x \right| \right)\; -\; \frac{\left( 6\sqrt{10} \right)}{14}\sqrt{4-\left( \left| x \right|-1 \right)^{2}}\; -\; y\; =\; 0$ looks like:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XKs3Z.png"" alt=""sixth factor without cut""></p>

"How to Determine if a Function is One-to-One","282917","","<p>I am looking for the ""best"" way to determine whether a function is one-to-one, either algebraically or with calculus. I know a common, yet arguably unreliable method for determining this answer would be to graph the function. However, this can prove to be a risky method for finding such an answer at it heavily depends on the precision of your graphing calculator, your zoom, etc...</p>

<p>What is the best method for finding that a function is one-to-one? In your description, could you please elaborate by showing that it can prove the following:</p>

<p>This is one-to-one: $\frac{x-3}{x+2}$</p>

<p>This is not one-to-one: $\frac{x-3}{x^3}$</p>
","<p>To show that $f$ is 1-1, you could show that $$f(x)=f(y)\Longrightarrow x=y.$$
So, for example, for $f(x)={x-3\over x+2}$:</p>

<p>Suppose ${x-3\over x+2}= {y-3\over y+2}$. Then:
\begin{align*}
&amp;{x-3\over x+2}= {y-3\over y+2}  \\
\Longrightarrow&amp; (y+2)(x-3)= (y-3)(x+2)\\
\iff&amp; yx+2x-3y-6= yx-3x+2y-6\\
\iff&amp;2x-3y =-3x+2y\\
\iff&amp;2x+3x =2y+3y\\
\iff&amp;5x =5y\\
\iff&amp;x=y
\end{align*}
So $f(x)={x-3\over x+2}$ is 1-1.</p>

<p>I'll leave showing that $f(x)={{x-3}\over 3}$ <i>is</i> 1-1 for you.</p>

<p>Alternatively, to show that $f$ is 1-1, you could show that $$x\ne y\Longrightarrow f(x)\ne f(y).$$</p>

<p>Or, to show that a differentiable $f$ is 1-1, you could show that its derivative $f'$ is either always positive or always negative. </p>

<p><br></p>

<p>You would discover that a function $g$ is not 1-1, if, when using the first method above, you find that the equation is satisfied for some $x\ne y$. For example, take $g(x)=1-x^2$. Then</p>

<p>$$
\eqalign{
&amp;g(x)=g(y)\cr
\iff&amp;{1-x^2}= {1-y^2}  \cr
\iff&amp;-x^2= -y^2\cr
\iff&amp;x^2=y^2\cr}
$$
The above equation has $x=1$, $y=-1$ as a solution.  So, there is $x\ne y$ with $g(x)=g(y)$; thus $g(x)=1-x^2$ is not 1-1.  </p>

<p>Of course, to show $g$ is not 1-1, you need only find two distinct values of the input value  $x$ that give $g$ the same output value. </p>

<p><hr>
Although you rightfully point out that the graphical method is unreliable; it is still instructive to consider the methods used and why they work:</p>

<p>Graphically, you can use either of the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use the ""Horizontal Line Test"":</p>

<p>$f$ is 1-1 if and only if every horizontal line intersects the graph
        of $f$ in at most one point.  Note that this is just the graphical
        interpretation of ""if $x\ne y$ then $f(x)\ne f(y)$""; since the
        intersection points of a horizontal line with the graph of $f$ give
        $x$ values for which $f(x)$ has the same value (namely the $y$-intercept of the line).</p></li>
<li><p>Use the fact that a continuous $f$ is 1-1 if and only if $f$ is either
    strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. This, of course, is
    equivalent to the derivative being always positive or always
    negative in the case where $f$ is differentiable. 
(Note this method  applies to only the green function below.) </p>

<p>Are these definitions correct? If possible, please give more than one example and counterexample. </p>
","<p>Yes, that's fine.</p>

<p>Events are mutually exclusive if the occurrence of one event excludes the occurrence of the other(s).  Mutually exclusive events cannot happen at the same time. For example: when tossing a coin, the result can either be <code>heads</code> or <code>tails</code> but cannot be both.</p>

<p>Events are independent if the occurrence of one event does not influence (and is not influenced by) the occurrence of the other(s).  For example: when tossing two coins, the result of one flip does not affect the result of the other.</p>

<p>$$\left.\begin{align}P(A\cap B) &amp;= P(A)P(B) \\ P(A\cup B) &amp;= P(A)+P(B)-P(A)P(B)\\ P(A\mid B)&amp;=P(A) \\ P(A\mid \neg B) &amp;= P(A)\end{align}\right\}\text{ independent }A,B$$</p>

<p><strong>Side note:</strong></p>

<p>We can find the equation line tangent to $y = 5-x^2$ at the point $(1,4)$ knowing the slope of the line is $-2$, and the fact that $(1, 4)$ lies on that line. We know the equation of a line can be written in the form $(y - y_0) = m(x - x_0)$, where $m$ represents the slope of the line, and $(x_0, y_0)$ represents a point on the line.</p>

<p>In our case, we've found slope to be given by $-2$, and $(x_0, y_0) = (1, 4)$. So, $$y - 4 = -2(x - 1) \iff y - 4 = -2x + 2 \iff y = 6 - 2x$$</p>

I know that if it spans $\mathbb{R}^3$, then for any $x, y, z, \in \mathbb{R}$, there exist $c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4$ such that $(x, y, z) = c_1(1, 1, 1) + c_2(3, 2, 1) + c_3(1, 1, 0) + c_4(1, 0, 0)$.</p>

<p>I've looked around the internet, but all the answers I found involve setting up a matrix and finding the determinant, and I can't do that here because my matrix isn't square. What am I missing here?</p>
","<p>There are several of things you can do. Here's four:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You can set up a matrix and use Gaussian elimination to figure out the dimension of the space they span. They span $\mathbb{R}^3$ if and only if the rank of the matrix is $3$. For example, you have
$$\begin{align*}
\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\
3 &amp; 2 &amp; 1\\
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{array}\right) &amp;\rightarrow \left(\begin{array}{ccc}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
3 &amp; 2 &amp; 1\\
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1
\end{array}\right) &amp;&amp;\rightarrow \left(\begin{array}{ccc}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 2 &amp; 1\\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1
\end{array}\right)\\
&amp;\rightarrow \left(\begin{array}{ccc}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 2 &amp; 1\\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1
\end{array}\right) &amp;&amp;\rightarrow \left(\begin{array}{ccc}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{array}\right).
\end{align*}$$
(Sequence of operations: exchanged rows 1 and 4; subtracted first row from other rows to make $0$s in first column; exchanged second and third rows; added multiples of the second row to third and fourth row to make $0$s in the second column).</p>

<p>At this point, it is clear the rank of the matrix is $3$, so the vectors span a subspace of dimension $3$, hence they span $\mathbb{R}^3$.</p></li>
<li><p>See if one of your vectors is a linear combination of the others. If so, you can drop it from the set and still get the same span; then you'll have three vectors and you can use the methods you found on the web. For example, you might notice that $(3,2,1) = (1,1,1)+(1,1,0)+(1,0,0)$; that means that
$$\mathrm{span}\Bigl\{(1,1,1),\ (3,2,1),\ (1,1,0),\ (1,0,0)\Bigr\} = \mathrm{span}\Bigl\{(1,1,1),\ (1,1,0),\ (1,0,0)\Bigr\}.$$</p></li>
<li><p>Determine if the vectors $(1,0,0)$, $(0,1,0)$, and $(0,0,1)$ lie in the span (or any other set of three vectors that you already know span). In this case this is easy: $(1,0,0)$ is in your set; $(0,1,0) = (1,1,0)-(1,0,0)$, so $(0,1,0)$ is in the span; and $(0,0,1) = (1,1,1)-(1,1,0)$, so $(0,0,1)$ is also in the span. Since the span contains the standard basis for $\mathbb{R}^3$, it contains all of $\mathbb{R}^3$ (and hence is equal to $\mathbb{R}^3$).</p></li>
<li><p>Solve the system of equations
$$\alpha\left(\begin{array}{c}1\\1\\1\end{array}\right) + \beta\left(\begin{array}{c}3\\2\\1\end{array}\right) + \gamma\left(\begin{array}{c}1\\1\\0\end{array}\right) + \delta\left(\begin{array}{c}1\\0\\0\end{array}\right) = \left(\begin{array}{c}a\\b\\c\end{array}\right)$$
for arbitrary $a$, $b$, and $c$. If there is always a solution, then the vectors span $\mathbb{R}^3$; if there is a choice of $a,b,c$ for which the system is inconsistent, then the vectors do not span $\mathbb{R}^3$. You can use the same set of elementary row operations I used in 1, with the augmented matrix leaving the last column indicated as expressions of $a$, $b$, and $c$. </p></li>

"Find the domain and range of a logarithmic function?","210056","","<p>I need help finding the domain and range of logarithm functions. For example, what is the domain and range of $y=\log(x-3)$?</p>
","<p>Let's take a look at the function $$y = \log(x - 3)$$</p>

<p>We are trying to find the Domain and the Range of this function, recalling that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Domain: Includes all values of $x$ for which the function <em>is defined</em>.</li>
<li><p>Range: Includes all values $y$ for which there is some $x$ such that $y = \log(x - 3)$.</p>

<p>It makes no sense to write $y = \log(a)$ when $a \leq 0$ because $\log(a)$ is defined only for positive $a$. So in this problem,  $y = \log(x - 3)$, is defined if and only if $x - 3 \gt 0 \iff x \gt 3$, and that gives you the domain $x\in (3, +\infty)$.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The range of $y$ is all of $\mathbb R$.</p>

<p>Graphing a function is a great way to confirm or gain insight into the domain and range of a function.</p>

<p>E.g. Below is the graph of the function $y = \log_e(x - 3)$.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YeOsR.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>As $x$ increases, so too does $y$. That is, $y$ is an increasing function.
As $x$ approaches $3$ from the right, although $y=\log_e(x - 3)$ is not defined for any $x \leq 3$, within the interval $x \in (3, 4)$, $y &lt; 0$. The closer $x$ is to $3$ (from the right), the smaller $y$ gets (the ""more negative"" $y$ becomes.)</p>

"What is the formula to calculate Profit Percentage?","209067","","<p>Let cost price of an item be $C$, selling price be $S$. Assume the seller makes a profit. </p>

<li>$P\% = \dfrac{P}{S} \times 100$</li>
</ol>

<p>Which one is right and why?</p>
","<p>The percentage profit $X$ is defined by</p>

<p>$$X = \left(\frac{\textrm{Amount of money you have at the end}}{\textrm{Amount of money you had at the start}} - 1\right) \times 100$$</p>

<p>Since you have $S$ at the end and $C$ at the start (because that's the money you needed to buy the item) then</p>

<p>$$X = \left( \frac{S}{C} - 1\right)\times 100 = \left(\frac{S-C}{C}\right)\times 100 = \frac{P}{C} \times 100$$</p>

<hr/>

<p>To see why your second decision has to be wrong, consider the case where you buy something for \$1 and sell it for \$1,001, so that $P$=1000. With your first definition,</p>

<p>$$X = 100\times \frac{1000}{1} = 100,000\%$$</p>

<p>which makes sense - you clearly made a huge profit, so you expect your percentage profit to be huge. With your second definition,</p>

<p>$$X = 100\times \frac{1000}{1001} = 99.9\%$$</p>

</ul>

<p>This definition applies to linear transformations as well, and in particular for linear transformations $T\colon \mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^m$, and by extension to matrices, since an $m\times n$ matrix $A$ can be identified with the linear transformation $L_A\colon\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^m$ given by $L_A(\mathbf{x}) = A\mathbf{x}$.</p>

<p>So, the definitions are for <em>any</em> functions. But when our sets $X$ and $Y$ have more structure to them, and the functions are not arbitrary, but special kinds of functions, we can often obtain <em>other</em> ways of characterizing a function as one-to-one or onto which is easier/better/more useful/more conceptual/has interesting applications. This is indeed the case when we have such a rich structure as linear transformations and vector spaces.</p>

<p>One-to-one is probably the easiest; this is because whether a function is one-to-one depends <em>only</em> on its domain, and not on its codomain. By contrast, whether a function is onto depends on <em>both</em> on the domain and the codomain (so, for instance, $f(x)=x^2$ is onto if we think of it as a function $f\colon\mathbb{R}\to[0,\infty)$, but not if we think of it as a function $f\colon\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$, or $f\colon[2,\infty)\to\[0,\infty)$). </p>

<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> <em>Let</em> $T\colon\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^m$ <em>be a linear transformation. The following are equivalent:</em></p>

<ol>
<li>$T$ <em>is one-to-one</em>.</li>
<li>$T(\mathbf{x})=\mathbf{0}$ <em>has only the trivial solution</em> $\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{0}$.</li>
<li><em>If</em> $A$ <em>is the standard matrix of</em> $T$, <em>then the columns of</em> $A$ <em>are linearly independent.</em></li>
</ol>

<p><em>Proof.</em> The equivalence of (1) and (2) is basic in linear algebra, so let's deal with that:</p>

<p>(1)$\Rightarrow$(2): If $T$ is one-to-one, then for all $\mathbf{x}$, since $T(\mathbf{0})=\mathbf{0}$ (being linear), then $T(\mathbf{x})=\mathbf{0}=T(\mathbf{0})$ implies $\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{0}$; this proves (2).</p>

<p>(2)$\Rightarrow$(1): Suppose $T(\mathbf{x}_1)=T(\mathbf{x}_2)$. Then
$$\mathbf{0} = T(\mathbf{x}_1) - T(\mathbf{x}_2) = T(\mathbf{x}_1-\mathbf{x}_2),$$
since $T$ is linear; because we are assuming (2), $T(\mathbf{x}_1-\mathbf{x}_2)=\mathbf{0}$ implies that $\mathbf{x}_1-\mathbf{x}_2 = \mathbf{0}$, so $\mathbf{x}_1=\mathbf{x}_2$, which proves that $T$ is indeed one-to-one.</p>

<p>The key to the connection with (3) (and eventually to your confusion) is that multiplying a matrix by a vector can be seen as an operation on columns. If
$$A=\left(\begin{array}{cccc}
a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{1n}\\
a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{2n}\\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots\\
a_{m1} &amp; a_{m2} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{mn}
\end{array}\right),$$
then let the <em>columns of</em> $A$, $A_1$, $A_2,\ldots,A_n$ be:
$$A_1 = \left(\begin{array}{c}a_{11}\\a_{21}\\ \vdots\\a_{m1}\end{array}\right),\quad A_2 = \left(\begin{array}{c}a_{12}\\a_{22}\\ \vdots\\ a_{m2}\end{array}\right),\quad\ldots,A_n = \left(\begin{array}{c}a_{1n}\\a_{2n}\\ \vdots\\ a_{mn}\end{array}\right).$$
Then we have the following:
$$A\left(\begin{array}{c}x_1\\x_2\\ \vdots\\x_n\end{array}\right) = x_1 A_1 + a_2 A_2 + \cdots + a_nA_n.$$
That is, multiplying $A$ by $\mathbf{x}$ gives a linear combination of the columns of $A$. This gives the direct connection we need between conditions (1) and (2), and condition (3).</p>

<p>(2)$\Rightarrow$(3): To show that the columns of $A$ are linearly independent, we need to show that if $\alpha_1A_1 + \cdots + \alpha_nA_n = \mathbf{0}$, then $\alpha_1=\cdots=\alpha_n=0$. So suppose $\alpha_1A_1+\cdots+\alpha_nA_n = \mathbf{0}$. Then
$$T(\mathbf{\alpha}) = A\mathbf{\alpha} = \alpha_1A_1+\cdots+\alpha_nA_n = \mathbf{0},\qquad\text{where }\mathbf{\alpha}=\left(\begin{array}{c}\alpha_1\\ \alpha_2\\ \vdots\\ \alpha_n\end{array}\right).$$
Because we are assuming (2), that means that from $T(\mathbf{\alpha}) = \mathbf{0}$ we can conclude that $\alpha=\mathbf{0}$; therefore, $\alpha_1=\cdots=\alpha_n=0$. This proves that $A_1,\ldots,A_n$ are linearly independent. </p>

<p>(3)$\Rightarrow$(2): Suppose the columns of $A$ are linearly independent, and 
$$\mathbf{0} = T(\mathbf{x}) = A\mathbf{x}\quad\text{where }\mathbf{x}=\left(\begin{array}{c}a_1\\a_2\\ \vdots\\ a_n\end{array}\right).$$
This means that $a_1A_1 + \cdots a_nA_n = \mathbf{0}$; since the columns of $A$ are assumed to be linearly independent, we conclude that $a_1=\cdots=a_n=0$, so $\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{0}$, proving (2). <strong>QED</strong></p>

<p>What about onto? There are two things here. One is a theorem similar to the one above; the other is the Rank-Nullity Theorem.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> <em>Let</em> $T\colon\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^m$ <em>be a linear transformation. The following are equivalent:</em></p>

<ol>
<li>$T$ <em>is onto</em>.</li>
<li><em>The equation</em> $T(\mathbf{x})=\mathbf{b}$ <em>has solutions for every</em> $\mathbf{b}\in\mathbb{R}^m$. </li>
<li><em>If</em> $A$ <em>is the standard matrix of</em> $T$, <em>then the columns of</em> $A$ <em>span</em> $\mathbb{R}^m$.  That is: every $\mathbf{b}\in\mathbb{R}^m$ is a linear combination of the columns of $A$.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Proof.</em> (1)$\Leftrightarrow$(2) is essentially the definition, only cast in terms of equations for the sake of similarity to the previous theorem.</p>

<p>(2)$\Rightarrow$(3) Let $\mathbf{b}\in\mathbb{R}^m$. Then by (2) there exists an $\mathbf{a}\in\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $T(\mathbf{a})=\mathbf{b}$. We have:
$$\mathbf{b} = T(\mathbf{a}) = A\mathbf{a} = A\left(\begin{array}{c}a_1\\a_2\\ \vdots\\a_n\end{array}\right) = a_1A_1 + a_2A_2 + \cdots + a_nA_n.$$
That is, we can express $\mathbf{b}$ as a linear combination of the columns of $A$. Since $\mathbf{b}$ is arbitrary, every vector in $\mathbb{R}^m$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the columns of $A$, so the columns of $A$ span $\mathbb{R}^m$; this proves (3).</p>

<p>(3)$\Rightarrow$(2) Suppose the columns of $A$ span $\mathbb{R}^m$ and let $\mathbf{b}\in\mathbb{R}^m$. We want to show that $T(\mathbf{x})=\mathbf{b}$ has at least one solution.</p>

<p>Since the columns of $A$ span $\mathbb{R}^m$, there exist scalars $\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n$ such that
$$\mathbf{b} = \alpha_1 A_1 + \cdots + \alpha_n A_n = A\left(\begin{array}{c}\alpha_1\\ \alpha_2\\ \vdots\\ \alpha_n\end{array}\right) = T(\mathbf{\alpha}).$$
So $\mathbf{\alpha})$, where
$$\mathbf{\alpha} = \left(\begin{array}{c}\alpha_1\\ \alpha_2\\ \vdots\\ \alpha_n\end{array}\right),$$
is a solution to $T(\mathbf{x})=\mathbf{b}$. This establishes (2). <strong>QED</strong></p>

<p>So: ""one-to-one""-ness is related to linear independence; ""onto""-ness is related to spanning properties. Note that linear independence is an <em>intrinsic</em> property (it depends only on the set of vectors), whereas spanning is an <em>extrinsic</em> property (it depends also on the space we are considering; it is <em>contextual</em>). This matches the fact that whether a function is one-to-one or not depends <em>only</em> on the domain, but whether it is onto depends on <em>both</em> the domain and the codomain of the function.</p>

<p>But there is a deep connection between the two. Remember the following:</p>

<p><strong>Definition.</strong> Let $A$ be an $m\times n$ matrix. The <em>nullity of</em> $A$, $\mathrm{nullity}(A)$, is the dimension of the kernel of $A$, that is, of the subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$ given by
$$\mathrm{ker}(A) = \Bigl\{ \mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^n\Bigm| A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{0}\Bigr\}.$$
The <em>rank of</em> $A$, $\mathrm{rank}(A)$ is the dimension of the image of $A$; that is, of the subspace of $\mathbb{R}^m$ given by
\begin{align*}
\mathrm{Im}(A) &amp;= \Bigl\\{ \mathbf{b}\in\mathbb{R}^m\Bigm| A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b}\text{ has at least one solution}\Bigr\\}\\\
&amp;= \Bigl\\{ A(\mathbf{x})\Bigm|\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^n\Bigr\\}.
\end{align*}</p>

<p>The deep connection between them is given by the Rank-Nullity Theorem:</p>

<p><strong>Rank-Nullity Theorem.</strong> Let $A$ be an $m\times n$ matrix. Then
$$\mathrm{rank}(A) + \mathrm{nullity}(A) = n.$$</p>

<p>Now we get two more equivalences for one-to-one and onto:</p>

<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> <em>Let</em> $T\colon\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R^m}$ <em>be a linear transformation. The following are equivalent:</em></p>

<ol>
<li>$T$ <em>is one-to-one</em>.</li>
<li>*The equation $T(\mathbf{x})=\mathbf{0}$ <em>has only the trivial solution</em> $\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{0}$.</li>
<li><em>If</em> $A$ <em>is the standard matrix of</em> $T$, <em>then the columns of</em> $A$ <em>are linearly independent.</em></li>
<li>$\mathrm{ker}(A) = \{\mathbf{0}\}$.</li>
<li>$\mathrm{nullity}(A) = 0$.</li>
<li>$\mathrm{rank}(A) = n$.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Proof.</em> The equivalence of (4) and (5) follows because only the trivial subspace has dimension $0$; the equivalence of (4) and (2) follows by definition of the kernel. The equivalence of (5) and (6) follows from the Rank-Nullity Theorem, since $n = \mathrm{nullity}(A)+\mathrm{rank}(A)$, so $\mathrm{nullity}(A) = 0$ if and only if $\mathrm{rank}(A) = n$. Since we already know (1), (2), and (3) are equivalent, the result follows. <strong>QED</strong></p>

<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> <em>Let</em> $T\colon\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^m$ <em>be a linear transformation. The following are equivalent:</em></p>

<ol>
<li>$T$ <em>is onto</em>.</li>
<li><em>The equation</em> $T(\mathbf{x})=\mathbf{b}$ <em>has solutions for every</em> $\mathbf{b}\in\mathbb{R}^m$. </li>
<li><em>If</em> $A$ <em>is the standard matrix of</em> $T$, <em>then the columns of</em> $A$ <em>span</em> $\mathbb{R}^m$.  That is: every $\mathbf{b}\in\mathbb{R}^m$ is a linear combination of the columns of $A$.</li>
<li>$\mathrm{Im}(A) = \mathbb{R}^m$.</li>
<li>$\mathrm{rank}(A) = m$.</li>
<li>$\mathrm{nullity}(A) = n-m$.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Proof.</em> We already know that (1), (2), and (3) are equivalent. The equivalence of (4) and (2) follows by the definition of the image. The equivalence of (4) and (5) follows because the only subspace of $\mathbb{R}^m$ that has dimension $m$ is the whole space. Finally, the equivalence of (5) and (6) follows from the rank nullity theorem: since $n = \mathrm{rank}(A)+\mathrm{nullity}(A)$, then $\mathrm{nullity}(A) = n - \mathrm{rank}(A)$. So the rank equals $m$ if and only if the nullity equals $n-m$. <strong>QED</strong></p>

<p>So now you have a whole bunch of ways of checking if a matrix is one-to-one, and of checking if a matrix is onto. None of them is ""better"" than the others: for some matrices, one will be easier to check, for other matrices, it may be a different one which is easy to check.  Also, the rank of a matrix is closely related to its row-echelon form, so that might help as well.</p>

<p>Note a few things: generally, ""onto"" and ""one-to-one"" are independent of one another. You can have a matrix be onto but not one-to-one; or be one-to-one but not onto; or be both; or be neither. The Rank-Nullity Theorem does place some restrictions: if $A$ is $m\times n$ and $m\lt n$, then the matrix cannot be onto (because $1\leq\mathrm{rank}(A)\leq m$, so if $\mathrm{rank}(A)+\mathrm{nullity}(A) = n$, we must have $\mathrm{nullity}(A)\gt 0$); dually, if $m\gt n$ then $A$ cannot be onto. In particular, the only matrices that can be <em>both</em> one-to-one and onto are square matrices. On the other hand, you can have an $m\times n$ matrix with $m\lt n$ that is onto, or one that is <em>not</em> onto. And you can have $m\times n$ matrices with $m\gt n$ that are one-to-one, and matrices that are <em>not</em> one-to-one. </p>

"How to study math to really understand it and have a healthy lifestyle with free time?","152908","","<p>Here's my problem. I'm studying math and when I really work hard, I think I understand things very good, but that comes at a big cost: in the last few years, I've had practically zero physical exercise, I've gained 30&nbsp;kg, I've spent countless hours studying at night, constantly had sleep deprivation, I've lost my social life, and I got health problems. My grades are quite good, but I feel as though I'm wasting my life.</p>

<p>I love mathematics when it's done my way, but that's hardly ever. I would very much like my career to be centered around mathematics (topology, algebra or something similar). I want to really understand things and I want the proofs to be done in a (reasonably) rigorous way. I've been accused of being a formalist before, but I don't consider myself one at all. However, I am a perfectionist, I admit. For comparison, the answers of Theo, Arturo, Jim Belk, Mariano, etc. are absolutely rigorous enough for me. From my experience, 80% or more mathematics in our school is done in a sketchy, ""hmm, probably true"" kind of way (just like reading cooking recipes), which bugs the hell out of me. Most classmates adapt to it. I for some reason can't. I don't understand things until I understand them (almost) completely. They learn ""how one should do things"", but less often do they ask themselves WHY is this correct. I have two friend physicists, who have the exact same problem. One is at the doctorate level, constantly frustrated, while the other abandoned physics altogether after getting a diploma. Apart from one 8, he had a perfect record, only 10s. He said that he doesn't feel he understands physics well enough. From my experience, ALL his classmates understand less than he does, they just go with the flow and accept certain statements as true.</p>

<p>Also, my problem is having weak memory. I forget a lot. Having to study a different subject each day is killing me. If it were up to me, I'd change the way lectures are done. We'd study only ONE subject for a month or two, then have the exams, and the next month or two the next subject. Mixing it up has a terrible effect: I forget things, because I constantly change the topic. That's why I'm always behind schedual. For example, in the second year, during the school year, I understood almost nothing of multivariable calculus, because I had to simultaneously study abstract algebra, topology, computer programming, etc, and couldn't keep up. But then, I devoted the whole three months of summer and got through all 330 pages of theory, understood it very good, including all the proofs ( which I was forgetting along the way), got a 9/10 grade, and had absolutely no vacations (stayed at home), no free time, no sport, no nothing. It was complete crap.</p>

<ul>
<li>should I not read the proofs at all?</li>
<li>should I try less hard, get worse grades and understanding, and 'have a life'?</li>
<li>abandon the idea of doing math for a living?</li>
<li>how can I spot the important/illustrative proofs, <em>without</em> studying them completely (it often happens, that I 'get the whole point' only after I've understood the whole proof)</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm not gifted/bright at all, I'm completely <strong>average with a bad memory</strong>, but I do have interest in math, good grades, and a horrible lifestyle for the last few years. <strong>This question is directed at people who have a career doing mathematics. How did you manage to study everything on time, AND sufficiently rigorous, that you were able to understand it?</strong></p>

<p>ADDITIONS:</p>

<p>I often tend to be the only one to find serious issues in the proofs, in the formulations of theorems, and also in the worked out exercises at classes. Everyone else either understands everything/most, or doesn't understand and also doesn't care for possible issues. Often do I find holes in the proofs and that hypotheses are missing in the theorem. When I present them to the professor, he says that I'm right, and says that I'm very precise. How is this precise, when the theorem doesn't hold in it's current state. Are we even supposed to understand proofs. Are the proofs actually really just sketches? How on earth is one then supposed to be able to discover mathematical truths? Is the study of mathematics just one big joke and you're not supposed to take it too seriously?</p>

<p>NOTE:</p>

<p>I have a bunch of sports I like and used to do. Also, I had a perfectly good social life before, so you don't need to give advice regarding that. I don't socialize and do sport because digesting proofs and trying to understand the ideas behind it all eats up all my time. If I go hiking, it will take away 2 days, 1 to actually walk + 1 to rest and regenerate. If I go train MMA, I won't be focused for the whole day. I can't just switch from boxing to diagram chasing in a moment. Also, I can't just study for half an hour. The way I study is I open the book, search up what I already know but forgot from the previous day, and then go from theorem to theorem, from proof to proof, correcting mistakes, adding clarifications, etc. etc. Also, I have a bad habit of having <strong>difficulty starting</strong> things, but when I do start 'my engine', I have <strong>difficulty stopping</strong>, especially if it's going good. That's why I unintentionally spend an hour or two before studying just doing the most irrelevant stuff, just to avoid study. This happens especially when I've had more math than I can shove down my throat, I have mental preparations to begin studying. But when my engine does start and studying goes well (proven a lot, understood a lot), it's hard for me to stop, so I often stay late at night, up to 4&nbsp;a.m., 5&nbsp;a.m., 6&nbsp;a.m. When the day of the exam arrives, I don't go to sleep at all, and the <strong>night and day are reversed</strong>. I go to sleep at 13h, and wake at 21h... I know it's not good but I can't seem to break this habit. If I'm useless through the whole day, I <strong>feel a need (guilty conscience) to do at least smth. useful before I go to sleep</strong>. I know this isn't supposed to happen if one loves mathematics, but when it's 'forced upon you' what and how much and in what amount of time you have to study, you start being put off by math. It stops being enjoyment/fun and becomes hard work that just needs to be done.

","<p>In my view the central question that you should ask yourself is what is the end <em>goal</em> of your studies. As an example, American college life as depicted in film is hedonistic and certainly not centered on actual studies. Your example is the complete opposite - you describe yourself as an ascetic devoted to scholarship.</p>

<p>Many people consider it important to lead a <em>balanced</em> life. If such a person were confronted with your situation, they might look for some compromise, for example investing fewer time on studies in return for lower grades. If things don't work out, they might consider opting out of the entire enterprise. Your viewpoint might be different - for you the most important dimension is intellectual growth, and you are ready to sacrifice all for its sake.</p>

<p>It has been mentioned in another answer that leading a healthy lifestyle might contribute to your studies. People tend to ""burn out"" if they work too hard. I have known such people, and they had to periodically ""cool off"" in some far-off place. On the contrary, non-curricular activities can be invigorating and refreshing.</p>

<p>Another, similar aspect is that of ""being busy"". Some people find that by multitasking they become more productive in each of their individual ""fronts"". But that style of life is not for every one.</p>

<p>Returning to my original point, what do you expect to accomplish by being successful in school? Are you aiming at an academic career? Professional career? In North America higher education has become a rite of passage, which many graduates find very problematic for the cost it incurs. For them the issue is often economical - education is expensive in North America.</p>

<p>You might find out that having completed your studies, you must turn your life to some very different track. You may come to realize that you have wasted some best years of your life by studying hard to the exclusion of everything else, an effort which would eventually lead you nowhere. This is the worst-case scenario.</p>

<p>More concretely, I suggest that you plan ahead and consider whether the cost is worth it. That requires both an earnest assessment of your own worth, and some speculation of the future job market. You should also estimate how important you are going to consider these present studies in your future - both from the economical and the ""cultural"" perspective.</p>

<p>This all might sound discouraging, but your situation as you describe it is quite miserable. Not only are you not satisfied with it, but it also looks problematic for an outside observer. However, I suspect that you're exaggerating, viewing the situation from a romantic, heroic perspective. It's best therefore to talk to people who know you personally.</p>

<p>Even better, talk to people who're older than you and in the next stage of ""life"". They have a wider perspective on your situation, which they of their acquaintances have just still vividly recall. However, even their recommendations must be taken with a grain of salt, since their present worries are only part of the larger picture, the all-encompassing ""life"".</p>

<hr>

<p>Finally, a few words more pertinent to the subject at hand.</p>

<p>First, learning strategy. I think the best way to learn is to solve challenging exercises. The advice given here, trying to ""reconstruct"" the textbook before reading it, seems very time consuming, and in my view, concentrating the effort at the wrong place</p>

<p>The same goes for memorizing theorems - sometimes one can only really ""understand"" the proof of a theorem by studying a more advanced topic. Even the researcher who originally came out with the proof probably didn't ""really"" understand it until a larger perspective was developed.</p>

<p>Memorizing theorems is not your choice but rather a necessity. I always disliked regurgitation and it is regrettable that this is forced unto you. I'm glad that my school would instead give us actual problems to solve - that's much closer to research anyway. Since you have to go through this lamentable process, try to come up with a method of memorization which has other benefits as well - perhaps aim at a better understanding of ""what is going on"" rather than the actual steps themselves. This is an important skill.</p>

<p>Second, one of the answers suggests trying to deduce as many theorems as possible as the ""mathematical"" thing that ought to be done after seeing a definition. I would suggest rather the opposite - first find out what the definition entails, and then try to understand why the concept was defined in the first place, and why in that particular way.</p>

<p>It is common in mathematics to start studying a subject with a long list of ""important definitions"", which have no import at all at that stage. You will have understood the subject when you can explain where these definitions are coming from, what objects they describe; and when you can ""feel"" these objects intuitively. This is a far cry from being able to deduce some facts that follow more-or-less directly from the definitions.</p>

"Solving Triangles (finding missing sides/angles given 3 sides/angles)","152166","","<p>What is a general procedure for ""solving"" a triangle—that is, for finding the unknown side lengths and angle measures given three side lengths and/or angle measures?</p>
","<p>First, some notation: let $A$, $B$, and $C$ be the measures of the three angles and let $a$, $b$, and $c$ be the lengths of the sides opposite those angles, respectively.  Now, let's look case-by-case at the possible sets of information we could have.</p>

<h2>SSS</h2>

<p>Let's start with the case where we know the three sides, $a$, $b$, and $c$.  We can use the Law of Cosines, in the form where it is solved for the cosine of an angle, to find the measures of two of the angles, then use the fact that the sum of the measures of the angles is 180° to find the third:</p>

<p>$$A=\arccos\left(\frac{b^2+c^2-a^2}{2bc}\right)$$</p>

<p>$$B=\arccos\left(\frac{a^2+c^2-b^2}{2ac}\right)$$</p>

<p>$$C=180°-A-B$$</p>

<h2>SAS</h2>

<p>If we know two sides and the measure of the angle they include, say $a$, $b$, and $C$, we can use the Law of Cosines to find the unknown side length, then pick up with the SSS process to find the unknown angles:</p>

<p>$$c=\sqrt{a^2+b^2-2ab\cos C}$$</p>

<p>$$A=\arccos\left(\frac{b^2+c^2-a^2}{2bc}\right)$$</p>

<p>$$B=180°-A-C$$</p>

<h2>ASA or AAS</h2>

<p>If we know the measures of two angles, we can find the measure of the third angle using $A+B+C=180°$, so let's assume we know all three angle measures $A$, $B$, and $C$, and the side length $a$.  We can use the Law of Sines to find each of the unknown side lengths:</p>

<p>$$b=\frac{a\sin B}{\sin A}$$</p>

<p>$$c=\frac{a\sin C}{\sin A}$$</p>

<h2>SSA</h2>

<p>If we know two side lengths and the measure of an angle that isn't included between the two known sides, say $a$, $b$, and $A$, we can start by using the Law of Sines to find $B$, but this may give two solutions:</p>

<p>$$\sin B=\frac{b\sin A}{a}$$</p>

<p>If $\sin B=\frac{b\sin A}{a}&gt;1$, then there is no solution and the given information does not determine a triangle (it is impossible for the given information to describe a triangle).  </p>

<p>If $\sin B=\frac{b\sin A}{a}=1$, then $B$ is a right angle and the given information determines a single triangle.  </p>

<p>If $\sin B=\frac{b\sin A}{a}&lt;1$, then there are two solutions for $B$:</p>

<p>$$B_1=\arcsin\left(\frac{b\sin A}{a}\right)\text{  or  }B_2=180°-B_1$$</p>

<p>In each case, we can use $A+B+C=180°$ to determine $C$:</p>

<p>$$C_1=180°-A-B_1\text{  or  }C_2=180°-A-B_2$$</p>

<p>At this point, $B_1$ and $C_1$ will definitely describe a triangle, but if $C_2\le0$ then $B_2$ and $C_2$ do not describe a triangle.  Whether we only have the $B_1$ case or both the $B_1$ and $B_2$ cases, we can use the Law of Cosines to find the unknown side:</p>

<p>$$c=\sqrt{a^2+b^2-2ab\cos C}$$</p>

<h2>AAA</h2>

<p>Knowing three angles only determines the triangle up to similarity—that is, if we don't know at least one length, we're not going to be able to find any lengths.</p>

"Finding an equation for a circle given its center and a point through which it passes","148278","","<p>No idea how to do this, I used to have these conic shapes committed to memory but I forget them already. </p>

<p>I am supposed to find an equation for the circle that has center $(-1, 4)$ and passes through $(3, -2)$.</p>

<p>I tried graphing it, but it didn't help since the point was not in a straight line with the center and I have no idea what the diameter is.</p>
","<p>Recall the:</p>

<p><b> Distance Formula:</b></p>

<p>The distance between the points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ is
$$
D=\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}
$$</p>

<p><br></p>

<p><b>Example:</b> </p>

<p>The radius of your circle is the distance between the points  $(-1,4)$ and $(3,-2)$. Using the Distance Formula:
$$
D= \sqrt{  \bigl(3-(-1)\bigr)^2 + (-2-4)^2  } 
= \sqrt{  4^2 + (-6)^2  } 
= \sqrt{ 16+36 }
=  \sqrt{ 52 } .
$$</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>What is the equation of the circle?</p>

<p>It is important to realize   the ""equation of the circle"" is: a point $(x,y)$ is on the circle if and only if the coordinates of the point $x$ and $y$ satisfy
the equation. So, how to get the equation? What is the relationship between the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of a point on the circle?</p>

<p>Well, let $(x,y)$ be a point on the circle. The big idea is:</p>

<p>$$
\text{The distance from the point }(x,y)\text{  to the center }(-1,4)\text{ is }\sqrt{52}.$$</p>

<p><br>
So, using the distance formula (with $(x_2,y_2)=(x,y)$ and $(x_1,y_1)=(-1,4)$) , it follows that 
$$
\sqrt{52}=\sqrt{\bigl(x-(-1)\bigr)^2 +(y-4)^2}.
$$  </p>

<p>Or
$$
52=(x+1)^2 +(y-4)^2.
$$  </p>

<p>The shortcut would be to just use the following formula (But it's important to realize why you'd use it and where it comes from):</p>

<p><b>Equation of a Circle</b></p>

<p>The equation of the circle with center located at $(a,b)$ and with radius $r$ is
$$
r^2=(x-a)^2 +(y-b)^2
$$
Note that the radius <i>squared</i> is on the left-hand side of the equation. </p>

<p>I can get the value for small values (aka the popular or easy to know roots), but is there a formula.  Similar to how to tell if a number is divisible by an integer.  </p>

<p>I have read <a href=""http://www.curiousmath.com/index.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=32"">this</a> and <a href=""http://www.curiousmath.com/index.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=43"">this</a> but could some one explain why it works? </p>
","<p>The idea of the first article is to rewrite any positive number $x$ as :
$$\tag{1}x=m\cdot 10^{\,e}$$ with $m$ the 'mantissa' : a real number between $1$ and $10$ (excluded)<br>
and $\,e\,$ the 'exponent' (or ""power of ten"") which is a signed integer.</p>

<p>From this we have $\;\tag{2}\log_{10}(x)= e+\log_{10}(m)$</p>

<p>(to keep notations short I'll write $\,\log(x)\,$ for $\,\log_{10}(x)\,$ and use $\,\ln(x)$ for the 'natural' logarithm)</p>

<p>Since the mantissa is between $1$ and $10$ the idea is to memorize the first logarithms (here I'll use up to $5$ digits, you may use fewer or more digits if you prefer) :</p>

<p>$$

8 &amp; 0.90309\\

\end{array}
$$</p>

<p>This seems to be much work but these values (except $\log(7)$) are not independent :</p>

<ul>
<li>$\log(2^n)=n\,\log(2)\;$ so that $\;\log(4)=2\log(2),\;\log(8)=3\log(2),\cdots$</li>
<li>more generally $\;\log(a\cdot b)=\log(a)+\log(b)\;$ so that the table could be rewritten (using $\,1=\log(10)=\log(2)+\log(5)$) :</li>
</ul>

<p>$$
\begin{array} {lll}
m &amp; \log\,m\\

8 &amp; 0.90309 &amp;3\,\log(2)\\
9 &amp; 0.95424 &amp;2\,\log(3)\\
\end{array}
$$</p>

<p>The table may thus be rebuilt with just three values (two if $\,\log(7)\,$ is omitted)!</p>

<p>One should memorize too $\;\ln(10) \approx 2.3026\,$ and its multiplicative inverse $\;\dfrac{1}{\ln(10)}=\dfrac{\ln(e)}{\ln(10)}=\log(e)\approx \dfrac 1{2.3026}\approx 0.4343$.</p>

<p>The classical expansion $\;\ln(1+x)\approx x\;$ will be rewritten as :<br>
$$\tag{3}\log(1+x)=\frac{\ln(1+x)}{\ln(10)}\approx 0.4343\cdot x$$ 
(with $x$ replaced by $\;x-\dfrac{x^2}2+\dfrac{x^3}3-\cdots\,$ if needed)</p>

<p>Let's apply all this to recover the (unfortunately lost...) value of $\,\log(7)\,$ using only $\;\log(2),\log(3),\log(e)$. One method is to use $\;\log(7)=\dfrac{\log(7^2)}2\;$ and :</p>

<p>\begin{align}
\log(49)&amp;=\log\left(50\;\left(1-\frac 1{50}\right)\right)\\
&amp;=\log\left(\frac{100}2\right)+\log\left(1-\frac 1{50}\right)\\
&amp;\approx\log(100)-\log(2)-0.4343\left(\frac 1{50}+\frac 1{2\cdot50^2}\right)\\
&amp;\approx 2-\log(2)-\frac{0.8686}{100}\left(1+\frac 1{100}\right)\\
&amp;\approx 2-0.30103-0.00877\\
&amp;\approx 1.69020
\end{align}</p>

<p>Dividing by $2$ will indeed give the wished $0.84510$. Without the $\dfrac{x^2}2$ term we would get $\,0.84514$ : also not that bad!
$$-$$</p>

<p>Let's further practice and compute $\log(29012)$ as in your article : $\log(29012)=\log(2.9012\cdot 10^4)=4+\log(2.9012)$</p>

<p>In first approximation we have $\;\log(2.9012) \approx \log(3) \approx 0.477\;$ and deduce that $\log(29012)\approx 4+0.477 \approx 4.477$.</p>

<p>we have $\;2.9012\approx 3\cdot 0.9671 \approx 3\cdot (1-0.0329)\;$ so that 
\begin{align}
\log(2.9012)&amp;\approx \log(3)+\log(1-0.0329)\\
&amp;\approx 0.47712-0.434\cdot 0.033\\
&amp;\approx 0.47712-0.0143\\
&amp;\approx 0.4628
\end{align}</p>

<p>and we got $\;\log(29012)\approx 4.4628\,$ not so far from the exact $4.4625776\cdots$</p>

<p>It is important to understand that the table of logarithms allows too the reverse computation that is to compute $10^{\,x}$.</p>

<p>Of course $10^{\,\log(2)}=2$ so that for example $10^{\,0.3}$ will be just a bit smaller than $2$.</p>

<p>For additional precision and for $x\ll 1$ let's write the useful $\displaystyle 10^x=e^{x\ln(10)}\approx 1+\ln(10)x\;$ or 
$$\tag{4}10^{\,x}\approx 1+2.3026\cdot x$$</p>

<p>To compute $10^{\,x}$ decompose $x$ in its integer part $i$ and fractional part $f$
then $10^{\,i+f}=10^{\,i}\cdot 10^{\,f}$ : the mantissa of this result $10^{\,f}$ will be found using the table and $i$ will of course be the exponent.</p>

<p>After that all applications may follow : compute $a^b$ for any positive real $a$ and real $b$ using $\,\log(a^b)=b\,\log(a)\;$ so that<br>
$$a^b=10^{\,b\log(a)}$$</p>

<p>Computing the $n$-th root of a positive real number will just be the special case  $\;b=\dfrac 1n$.</p>

<p>Example $\sqrt[5]{1212}$ : 
\begin{align} 
1212&amp;\approx 3\cdot 4\cdot 100\cdot 1.01\\
\log(1212)&amp;\approx 2+\log(3)+\log(4)+0.4343/100\\
\dfrac{\log(1212)}{5}&amp;\approx \frac{2+0.47712+0.60206+0.00434}5\\
\approx 0.6167
\end{align}
The answer (approximatively $10^{\,0.6167}$) will thus be a little over $4$.</p>

<p>More exactly $\,0.61670=0.60206+0.01464\,$ and since $\,10^{0.01464}\approx 1+2.3\cdot 0.0146 \approx 1.0336\;$ an approximate result will be  $4\cdot 1.0336$ that is : $$\sqrt[5]{1212}\approx 4.134$$ while the exact result is $4.1371429\cdots$.</p>

<p>Many methods may be used to get more precision :  </p>

<ul>
<li>from $1212=1200\cdot 1.01$ expand the logarithm (and/or the power of $10$) to second order as done for $\log(7)$</li>
<li>compose (+ -) different exact values of logarithms to get values near the searched one (example $\,1.33\approx \dfrac 43$ and thus $\;\log(1.33)\approx \log(4)-\log(3)$)</li>
<li>memorize values nearer to $1$ : $\log(1.1)\approx 0.041393,\ \log(1.2)=\log(\frac{3\cdot4}{10})\approx 0.07918$ and so on (you should nearly 'recognize' $\log(1.01)= 0.004321$... (see $\log(e)$) and won't need to memorize $\log(1.001)$)</li>

$ln(1+x) = \Sigma_{k=0}^{\infty} \int (-x)^k dx$</p>
","<p>You got the general expansion about $x=a$. Here we are intended to take $a=0$. That is, we are finding the Maclaurin series of $\ln(1+x)$.
That will simplify your expression considerably. Note also that $\frac{(n-1)!}{n!}=\frac{1}{n}$.  </p>

<p>The approach in the suggested solution also works. We note that
$$\frac{1}{1+t}=1-t+t^2-t^3+\cdots\tag{1}$$
if $|t|\lt 1$ (infinite geometric series). Then we note that
$$\ln(1+x)=\int_0^x \frac{1}{1+t}\,dt.$$
Then we integrate the right-hand side of (1) term by term.  We get
$$x-\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^3}{3}-\frac{x^4}{4}+\cdots,$$
precisely the same thing as what one gets by putting $a=0$ in your expression.</p>

"Finding the tangent line to a curve at a given point? Stumped by simple problem.","135394","","<p>Obtaining an equation for the tangent of a curve is a problem I've done many times in the past and should be fairly straightforward for simple problems like these. However, I've been graphing my answers to check if they are correct and things are just not adding up. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>y = mx+b</p>
  
  <p>2 = 6(1)-3(1)<sup>2</sup>+b</p>
  
  <p>2 = 3+b</p>

"Inverse of the sum of matrices","135221","","<p>I have two square matrices - $A$ and $B$. $A^{-1}$ is known and I want to calculate $(A+B)^{-1}$. Are there theorems that help with calculating the inverse of the sum of matrices? In general case $B^{-1}$ is not known, but if it is necessary then it can be assumed that $B^{-1}$ is also known.</p>
","<p>In general, $A+B$ need not be invertible, even when $A$ and $B$ are. But one might ask whether you can have a formula under the additional assumption that $A+B$ <em>is</em> invertible.</p>

<p>As noted by Adrián Barquero, there is <a href=""http://www.jstor.org/stable/2690437"">a paper by Ken Miller</a> published in the <em>Mathematics Magazine</em> in 1981 that addresses this. </p>

<p>He proves the following:</p>

<p><strong>Lemma.</strong> If $A$ and $A+B$ are invertible, and $B$ has rank $1$, then let $g=\mathrm{trace}(BA^{-1})$. Then $g\neq -1$ and 
$$(A+B)^{-1} = A^{-1} - \frac{1}{1+g}A^{-1}BA^{-1}.$$</p>

<p>From this lemma, we can take a general $A+B$ that is invertible and write it as $A+B = A + B_1+B_2+\cdots+B_r$, where $B_i$ each have rank $1$ and such that each $A+B_1+\cdots+B_k$ is invertible (such a decomposition always exists if $A+B$ is invertible and $\mathrm{rank}(B)=r$). Then you get:</p>

<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Let $A$ and $A+B$ be nonsingular matrices, and let $B$ have rank $r\gt 0$. Let $B=B_1+\cdots+B_r$, where each $B_i$ has rank $1$, and each $C_{k+1} = A+B_1+\cdots+B_k$ is nonsingular. Setting $C_1 = A$, then
$$C_{k+1}^{-1} = C_{k}^{-1} - g_kC_k^{-1}B_kC_k^{-1}$$
where $g_k = \frac{1}{1 + \mathrm{trace}(C_k^{-1}B_k)}$. In particular,
$$(A+B)^{-1} = C_r^{-1} - g_rC_r^{-1}B_rC_r^{-1}.$$</p>

<p>(If the rank of $B$ is $0$, then $B=0$, so $(A+B)^{-1}=A^{-1}$). </p>

"Why is Infinity multiplied by Zero not an easy Zero answer?","134823","","<p>I did a bit of math at school and it seems like an easy one - what am I missing?</p>

<p>$$n\times m = \underbrace{n+n+\cdots +n}_{m\text{ times}}$$</p>

<p>$$\quad n\times 0 = \underbrace{0 + 0 + \cdots+ 0}_{n\text{ times}} = 0$$</p>

<p>(i.e add $0$ to $0$ as many times as you like, result is $0$)</p>

<p>So I thought an infinite number of 0's cannot be anything but 0? But someone claims different but couldn't offer a reasonable explanation why. Google results seemed a bit iffy on the subject - hopefully this question will change that.</p>
","<p>The problem is that the laws of addition and multiplication you are using hold for <em>natural numbers</em>, but infinity is not a natural number, so these laws do not apply. If they did, you could use a similar argument that multiplying anything by infinity, no matter how small, gives infinity, thus $\infty \times 0 = \infty$. More sophisticated arguments can also be made, like $\infty \times 0 = \lim_{x \to \infty} (x \times 1/x) = 1$. Clearly all these different values for $\infty \times 0$ mean that $\infty$ cannot be treated like other numbers.</p>

<p>In order to work with infinity, you must first define it. You may think you know what infinity is, but really you don't have a concrete definition. In fact, there are <em>many</em> different definitions of infinity that you could use, each of which result in different behaviors. For example, the <em>real projective line</em> has a concept of infinity such that $1/\infty = 0$, while when talking about infinite sets one uses <em>cardinal numbers</em> (another type of infinity) to represent the sizes of these sets. You must make it clear what infinity you are talking about in order to work with it.</p>

<p>In summary, the expression $\infty \times 0$ using multiplication defined for the natural numbers does not have any meaning, so it cannot be said to be equal to $0$.</p>

"Eigenvectors of real symmetric matrices are orthogonal","134648","","<p>Can someone point me to a paper, or show here, why symmetric matrices have orthogonal eigenvectors? In particular, I'd like to see proof that for a symmetric matrix $A$ there exists decomposition $A = Q\Lambda Q^{-1} = Q\Lambda Q^{T}$ where $\Lambda$ is diagonal.</p>
","<p>For any real matrix $A$ and any vectors $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$, we have
$$\langle A\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\rangle = \langle\mathbf{x},A^T\mathbf{y}\rangle.$$
Now assume that $A$ is symmetric, and $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ are eigenvectors of $A$ corresponding to distinct eigenvalues $\lambda$ and $\mu$. Then
$$\lambda\langle\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\rangle = \langle\lambda\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\rangle = \langle A\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\rangle = \langle\mathbf{x},A^T\mathbf{y}\rangle = \langle\mathbf{x},A\mathbf{y}\rangle = \langle\mathbf{x},\mu\mathbf{y}\rangle = \mu\langle\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\rangle.$$
Therefore, $(\lambda-\mu)\langle\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\rangle = 0$. Since $\lambda-\mu\neq 0$, then $\langle\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\rangle = 0$, i.e., $\mathbf{x}\perp\mathbf{y}$.</p>

<p>Now find an orthonormal basis for each eigenspace; since the eigenspaces are mutually orthogonal, these vectors together give an orthonormal subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Finally, since symmetric matrices are diagonalizable, this set will be a basis (just count dimensions). The result you want now follows.</p>

If you run into a mother who has dropped off a kid at this birthday party and who has two children, the chance that she has two girls is $1/3$. Why? $3/4$ of the mothers with two children will have a daughter at the birthday party, the ones with two girls ($1/4$ of the total mothers with two children) and the ones with one girl and one boy ($1/2$ of the total mothers with two children). Out of these $3/4$ of the mothers, $1/3$ have two girls.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the birthday party is only for fifth-grade girls, you get a different answer. Assuming there are no siblings who are both in the fifth grade, the answer in this case is $1/2$. The child in fifth grade is a girl, but the other child has probability $1/2$ of being a girl. Situations of this kind arise in real life much more commonly than situations of the other kind, so the answer of $1/3$ is quite nonintuitive.</p>

<p>Please help me.</p>
","<p>To answer you directly, you just want the slope of your line: 3.7.</p>

<p>But consider, please:</p>

<p>Below is an accurate scatter plot of your data. Despite what the instructions suggest, you do not know what the graph of $s$ looks like. However, you can imagine a curve that models the data points.  This curve is the purple curve shown in the diagram.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tDP3T.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Now, the instantaneous velocity at $t=3$ is approximately the slope of the tangent line shown above (approximate because the tangent line shown is tangent to the blue curve and the blue curve approximates the graph of $s$). </p>

<p>How can you estimate this slope using the tabular data? Well, it's essentially what you did: estimate the slope of the tangent line, and hence the instantaneous velocity at $t=3$, with the slope of a secant line between two of the given data points. (Note, please, you only need to estimate the slope of the line; you do not need to find the equation of the tangent line.)</p>

<p>But, you cannot select those two points randomly, this may give a bad estimate. In particular, you want $(3,10.7)$ to be ""between"" or one of the two points that you choose. Looking at the picture, it should be clear that the best points to choose are $(2,5.1)$ and $(4,17.7)$. </p>

<p>So, we will estimate the instantaneous velocity with the average velocity over $[2,4]$ (the average velocity over $[2,4]$ is the slope of the line connecting the points $[2,5.1]$ and $[4,17.7]$).</p>

$$\int (ax+b)^{\alpha}dx = \int y^{\alpha} \dfrac{dy}a = \dfrac1a \dfrac{y^{\alpha+1}}{\alpha+1} + \text{ constant} = \dfrac1a \dfrac{(ax+b)^{\alpha+1}}{\alpha+1} + \text{ constant}$$

"Where to start learning Linear Algebra?","119749","","<p>I'm starting a very long quest to learn about math, so that I can program games. I'm mostly a corporate developer, and it's somewhat boring and non exciting. When I began my career, I chose it because I wanted to create games.</p>

<p>I'm told that Linear Algebra is the best place to start. Where should I go?</p>
","<p>You are right: Linear Algebra is not just the ""best"" place to start. It's THE place to start.</p>

<p>Among all the books cited in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra"">Wikipedia - Linear Algebra</a>, I would recommend:</p>

<ul>
<li>Strang, Gilbert, Linear Algebra and Its Applications (4th ed.) </li>
</ul>

<p>Strang's book has at least two reasons for being recomended. First, it's extremely easy and short. Second, it's the book they use at MIT for the extremely good video Linear Algebra course you'll find in the link of Unreasonable Sin.</p>

<p>For a view towards applications (though maybe not necessarily your applications) and still elementary:</p>

<ul>
<li>B. Noble &amp; J.W. Daniel: Applied Linear Algebra, Prentice-Hall, 1977</li>
</ul>

<p>Linear algebra has two sides: one more ""theoretical"", the other one more ""applied"". Strang's book is just elementary, but perhaps ""theoretical"". Noble-Daniel is definitively ""applied"". The distinction from the two points of view relies in the emphasis they put on ""abstract"" vector spaces vs specific ones such as $\mathbb{R}^n$ or $\mathbb{C}^n$, or on matrices vs linear maps.</p>

<p>Maybe because my penchant towards ""pure"" maths, I must admit that sometimes I find matrices somewhat annoying. They are funny, specific, whereas linear maps can look more ""abstract"" and ""ethereal"". But, for instance: I can't stand the proof that the matrix product is associative, whereas the corresponding associativity for the composition of (linear or non linear) maps is true..., well, just because it can't help to be true the first moment you write it down.</p>

<p>Anyway, at a more advanced level in the ""theoretical"" side you can use:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Greub, Werner H., Linear Algebra, Graduate Texts in Mathematics (4th ed.), Springer</p></li>
<li><p>Halmos, Paul R., Finite-Dimensional Vector Spaces, Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics, Springer</p></li>
<li><p>Shilov, Georgi E., Linear algebra, Dover Publications </p></li>
</ul>

<p>In the ""applied"" (?) side, a book that I love and you'll appreciate if you want to study, for instance, the exponential of a matrix is <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0486445542"">Gantmacher</a>.</p>

<p>And, at any time, you'll need to do a lot of exercises. Lipschutz's is second to none in this:</p>

"What is the importance of eigenvalues/eigenvectors?","118990","","<p>What is the importance of eigenvalues/eigenvectors?  </p>
","<h3>Short Answer</h3>

<p><em>Eigenvectors make understanding linear transformations easy</em>. They are the ""axes"" (directions) along which a linear transformation acts simply by ""stretching/compressing"" and/or ""flipping""; eigenvalues give you the factors by which this compression occurs. </p>

<p>The more directions you have along which you understand the behavior of a linear transformation, the easier it is to understand the linear transformation; so you want to have as many linearly independent eigenvectors as possible associated to a single linear transformation.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Slightly Longer Answer</h3>

<p>There are a lot of problems that can be modeled with linear transformations, and the eigenvectors give very simply solutions. For example, consider the system of linear differential equations
\begin{align*}
\frac{dx}{dt} &amp;= ax + by\\\
\frac{dy}{dt} &amp;= cx + dy.
\end{align*}
This kind of system arises when you describe, for example, the growth of population of two species that affect one another. For example, you might have that species $x$ is a predator on species $y$; the more $x$ you have, the fewer $y$ will be around to reproduce; but the fewer $y$ that are around, the less food there is for $x$, so fewer $x$s will reproduce; but then fewer $x$s are around so that takes pressure off $y$, which increases; but then there is more food for $x$, so $x$ increases; and so on and so forth. It also arises when you have certain physical phenomena, such a particle on a moving fluid, where the velocity vector depends on the position along the fluid.</p>

<p>Solving this system directly is complicated. But suppose that you could do a change of variable so that instead of working with $x$ and $y$, you could work with $z$ and $w$ (which depend linearly on $x$ and also $y$; that is, $z=\alpha x+\beta y$ for some constants $\alpha$ and $\beta$, and $w=\gamma x + \delta y$, for some constants $\gamma$ and $\delta$) and the system transformed into something like
\begin{align*}
\frac{dz}{dt} &amp;= \kappa z\\\
\frac{dw}{dt} &amp;= \lambda w
\end{align*}
that is, you can ""decouple"" the system, so that now you are dealing with two <em>independent</em> functions. Then solving this problem becomes rather easy: $z=Ae^{\kappa t}$, and $w=Be^{\lambda t}$. Then you can use the formulas for $z$ and $w$ to find expressions for $x$ and $y$..</p>

<p>Can this be done? Well, it amounts <em>precisely</em> to finding two linearly independent eigenvectors for the matrix $\left(\begin{array}{cc}a &amp; b\\c &amp; d\end{array}\right)$! $z$ and $w$ correspond to the eigenvectors, and $\kappa$ and $\lambda$ to the eigenvalues.  By taking an expression that ""mixes"" $x$ and $y$, and ""decoupling it"" into one that acts independently on two different functions, the problem becomes a lot easier. </p>

<p>That is the essence of what one hopes to do with the eigenvectors and eigenvalues: ""decouple"" the ways in which the linear transformation acts into a number of independent actions along separate ""directions"", that can be dealt with independently. A lot of problems come down to figuring out these ""lines of independent action"", and understanding them can really help you figure out what the matrix/linear transformation is ""really"" doing. </p>

<p>This proves that the inverse of $A^T$ is $(A^{-1})^T$. So the answer to your question is yes.</p>

<p>What is $h$?</p>
","<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/84nvC.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>solution sketch: </p>

<p>Note that $h$ divides the triangle into <strong>two right triangles</strong> (h is the perpendicular bisector (altitude) from the base to the opposite vertex); the angles line $h$ forms with $a$ are <strong>right angles</strong>. This gives you two right triangles, and you only need one of them to compute the values you need. </p>

<p>Call the two known (marked) angles $\theta$ (they are equal). </p>

<p>If you know the length of the side $b$: $\sin\theta = \dfrac{h}{b} \implies h = b\sin\theta$</p>

<p>If $a$ is known, $\tan\theta = \dfrac{h}{a/2} \implies h = \dfrac{a}{2}\tan \theta$. </p>

<hr>

<p>Now, using the pythorean theorem to relate your sides, we know that</p>

<p>If the length of $b$ is unknown, using the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>pythagorean theorem</strong></a>, then knowing $a/2$ and $h$ will allow you to solve for $b$.</p>

","<p>Congratulations! You've stumbled in to a very interesting question!</p>

<p>In higher mathematics, we often notice that some things which are really easy to talk about but difficult to express rigorously have a property which is really easy to express rigorously but something that we probably wouldn't have thought of to begin with.</p>

<p>The trig functions are one of these things. With (a lot of) effort, you can show that </p>

<p>$$\sin x = x - \frac{x^3}{6} + \frac{x^5}{120} - \frac{x^7}{5040} + \frac{x^9}{362880} - \cdots $$</p>

<p>where the patterns of increasing the powers of $x$ by $2$, and switching between $+$ and $-$ signs continues forever. (The denominators also have a pattern: take the power that $x$ is raised to in the term and multiply it by all of the smaller numbers down to $1$; that is the number in the denominator). Note that you have to use radians for this exact formula to work; of course you could come up with one for degrees as well.</p>

<p>When you start realizing that circles are actually quite tricky objects to define, formulas like that one start to look more appealing. I have had multiple mathematics textbooks take this infinitely long expression as the <em>definition</em> of the sine function. (It turns out to be the same thing as the circle definition, but… well, circles get complicated.)</p>

<p>Of course, we can't sit around multiply and add for the rest of our lives just to compute sin $1$, but we can just cut off the operations after a couple terms. If you go out to the $x^7$ term, you can guarantee that your answer is accurate to at least 3 decimal places as long as you use angles between $-\frac{\pi}{2}$ and $\frac\pi 2$. (These are the only angles you really need, if you get rid of multiples of $\pi$ properly.)</p>

<p>The cosine formula, in case you are interested, is similar:
$$\cos x = 1  - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^4}{24} - \frac{x^6}{720}+ \frac{x^8}{40320}-\cdots$$</p>

<p>The internet has formulas for the other trig functions, but you can always just combine these.</p>

<p>As copper.hat says, there are also these large books where people did the calculations once and wrote them down so that nobody would have to do them again. Of course, these were made long before computers existed; nobody makes them anymore! But somebody from your parents' or grandparents' generation probably still has one sitting in their house.</p>

","<p>Here's perhaps a better way to think of the shadow price.  (I don't like the word ""relax"" here; I think it's confusing.)</p>

<p>For maximization problems like this one the constraints can often be thought of as restrictions on the amount of resources available, and the objective can be thought of as profit.  Then the <em>shadow price</em> associated with a particular constraint tells you how much the optimal value of the objective would increase per unit increase in the amount of resources available.  In other words, <strong>the shadow price associated with a resource tells you how much more profit you would get by increasing the amount of that resource by one unit.</strong>  (So ""How much you would be willing to pay for an additional resource"" is a good way of thinking about the shadow price.)  </p>

<p>In the example you give, there are 16 units available of the first resource and 35 units available of the second resource.  The fact that the shadow price of $c_1$ is 0.727273 means that if you could increase the first resource from 16 units to 17 units, you would get an additional profit of about \$0.73.  Similarly, if you could increase the second resource from 35 units to 36 units then you would get an additional profit of about \$0.02.  </p>

<p>So if you could increase just one resource by one unit, <em>and the cost of increasing the first resource is the same as that of increasing the second resource</em> (this assumption is not part of the model), then, yes, you should definitely increase the first resource by one unit.</p>

"Difference between NFA and DFA","109078","","<p>In very simple terms please, all resources I'm finding are talking about tuples and stuff and I just need a simple explanation that I can remember easily because I keep getting them mixed up.</p>
","<p>Each input to a DFA or NFA affects the state of the automaton: if it was in state $q$ immediately before the input, either it will be in some state $q'$ after the input, or the input will cause it to choke. (Note that $q'$ may be the same as $q$.) Suppose that we have an automaton in a state $q$. The difference in behavior between a DFA and an NFA is this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If it’s a DFA, each possible input determines the resulting state $q'$ uniquely. Every input causes a state change, and the new state is completely determined by the input. Moreover, the automaton can change state <strong>only</strong> after reading an input.</p></li>
<li><p>If it’s an NFA, some inputs may allow a choice of resulting states, and some may cause the automaton to choke, because there is <strong>no</strong> new state corresponding to that input. Moreover, the automaton may be constructed so that it can change state to some new state $q'$ without reading any input at all.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>As a consequence of this difference in behavior, DFA’s and NFA’s differ in another very important respect.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you start a DFA in its initial state and input some word $w$, the state $q$ in which the DFA ends up is completely determined by $w$: inputting $w$ to the DFA will always cause it to end up in state $q$. This is what is meant by calling it <em>deterministic</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>If you start an NFA in its initial state and input some word $w$, there may be several possible states in which it can end up, since some of the inputs along the way may have allowed a choice of state changes. Consequently, you can’t predict from $w$ alone in exactly which state the automaton will finish; this is what is meant by calling it <em>nondeterministic</em>. (And it’s actually a little worse than I’ve indicated, since an NFA is also allowed to have more than one initial state.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, these differences affect how we determine what words are accepted (or recognized) by an automaton. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>If it’s a DFA, we know that each word completely determines the final state of the automaton, and we say that the word is accepted if that state is an acceptor state.</p></li>
<li><p>If it’s an NFA, there might be several possible final states that could result from reading a given word; as long as at least one of them is an acceptor state, we say that the automaton accepts the word.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>What I’ve described informally is the view of an NFA that makes it look most like a DFA and that I think best explains why it’s called <em>nondeterministic</em>. There is, however, another way of looking at NFAs: it’s also possible to think of an NFA as being in multiple states at once, as if it were making all possible choices at each input. If you think of it in those terms, you can say that it accepts a word provided that at least one of the states in which it ends up after reading that word is an acceptor state. This point of view is perhaps most useful for understanding the algorithm used to turn an NFA into an equivalent DFA.</p>

<p>I am also interested in cases when only numerator or only denominator is present under the logarithm.</p>
","<p>I will transform the integral via a substitution, break it up into two pieces and recombine, perform an integration by parts, and perform another substitution to get an integral to which I know a closed form exists.  From there, I use a method I know to attack the integral, but in an unusual way because of the 8th degree polynomial in the denominator of the integrand.</p>

<p>First sub $t=(1-x)/(1+x)$, $dt=-2/(1+x)^2 dx$ to get</p>

<p>$$2 \int_0^{\infty} dt \frac{t^{-1/2}}{1-t^2} \log{\left (\frac{5-2 t+t^2}{1-2 t +5 t^2} \right )} $$</p>

<p>Now use the symmetry from the map $t \mapsto 1/t$.  Break the integral up into two as follows:</p>

<p>\begin{align}
&amp; 2 \int_0^{1} dt \frac{t^{-1/2}}{1-t^2} \log{\left (\frac{5-2 t+t^2}{1-2 t +5 t^2} \right )} + 2 \int_1^{\infty} dt \frac{t^{-1/2}}{1-t^2} \log{\left (\frac{5-2 t+t^2}{1-2 t +5 t^2} \right )} \\ 
&amp;= 2 \int_0^{1} dt \frac{t^{-1/2}}{1-t^2} \log{\left (\frac{5-2 t+t^2}{1-2 t +5 t^2} \right )} + 2 \int_0^{1} dt \frac{t^{1/2}}{1-t^2} \log{\left (\frac{5-2 t+t^2}{1-2 t +5 t^2} \right )} \\ 
&amp;= 2 \int_0^{1} dt \frac{t^{-1/2}}{1-t} \log{\left (\frac{5-2 t+t^2}{1-2 t +5 t^2} \right )}
\end{align}</p>

<p>Sub $t=u^2$ to get</p>

<p>$$4 \int_0^{1} \frac{du}{1-u^2} \log{\left (\frac{5-2 u^2+u^4}{1-2 u^2 +5 u^4} \right )}$$</p>

<p>Integrate by parts:</p>

<p>$$\left [2 \log{\left (\frac{1+u}{1-u} \right )} \log{\left (\frac{5-2 u^2+u^4}{1-2 u^2 +5 u^4} \right )}\right ]_0^1 \\- 32 \int_0^1 du \frac{\left(u^5-6 u^3+u\right)}{\left(u^4-2 u^2+5\right) \left(5 u^4-2 u^2+1\right)} \log{\left (\frac{1+u}{1-u} \right )}$$</p>

<p>One last sub: $u=(v-1)/(v+1)$ $du=2/(v+1)^2 dv$, and finally get</p>

<p>$$8 \int_0^{\infty} dv \frac{(v^2-1)(v^4-6 v^2+1)}{v^8+4 v^6+70v^4+4 v^2+1} \log{v}$$</p>

<p>With this form, we may finally conclude that a closed form exists and apply the residue theorem to obtain it.  To wit, consider the following contour integral:</p>

<p>$$\oint_C dz \frac{8 (z^2-1)(z^4-6 z^2+1)}{z^8+4 z^6+70z^4+4 z^2+1} \log^2{z}$$</p>

<p>where $C$ is a keyhole contour about the positive real axis.  This contour integral is equal to (I omit the steps where I show the integral vanishes about the circular arcs)</p>

<p>$$-i 4 \pi \int_0^{\infty} dv \frac{8 (v^2-1)(v^4-6 v^2+1)}{v^8+4 v^6+70v^4+4 v^2+1} \log{v} + 4 \pi^2 \int_0^{\infty} dv \frac{8 (v^2-1)(v^4-6 v^2+1)}{v^8+4 v^6+70v^4+4 v^2+1}$$</p>

<p>It should be noted that the second integral vanishes; this may be easily seen by exploiting the symmetry about $v \mapsto 1/v$.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the contour integral is $i 2 \pi$ times the sum of the residues about the poles of the integrand.  In general, this requires us to find the zeroes of the eight degree polynomial, which may not be possible analytically.  Here, on the other hand, we have many symmetries to exploit, e.g., if $a$ is a root, then $1/a$ is a root, $-a$ is a root, and $\bar{a}$ is a root.  For example, we may deduce that</p>

<p>$$z^8+4 z^6+70z^4+4 z^2+1 = (z^4+4 z^3+10 z^2+4 z+1)  (z^4-4 z^3+10 z^2-4 z+1)$$</p>

<p>which exploits the $a \mapsto -a$ symmetry.  Now write</p>

<p>$$z^4+4 z^3+10 z^2+4 z+1 = (z-a)(z-\bar{a})\left (z-\frac{1}{a}\right )\left (z-\frac{1}{\bar{a}}\right )$$</p>

<p>Write $a=r e^{i \theta}$ and get the following equations:</p>

<p>$$\left ( r+\frac{1}{r}\right ) \cos{\theta}=-2$$
$$\left (r^2+\frac{1}{r^2}\right) + 4 \cos^2{\theta}=10$$</p>

<p>From these equations, one may deduce that a solution is $r=\phi+\sqrt{\phi}$ and $\cos{\theta}=1/\phi$, where $\phi=(1+\sqrt{5})/2$ is the golden ratio.  Thus the poles take the form</p>

<p>$$z_k = \pm \left (\phi\pm\sqrt{\phi}\right) e^{\pm i \arctan{\sqrt{\phi}}}$$</p>

<p>Now we have to find the residues of the integrand at these 8 poles.  We can break this task up by computing:</p>

<p>$$\sum_{k=1}^8 \operatorname*{Res}_{z=z_k} \left [\frac{8 (z^2-1)(z^4-6 z^2+1)  \log^2{z}}{z^8+4 z^6+70z^4+4 z^2+1}\right ]=\sum_{k=1}^8 \operatorname*{Res}_{z=z_k} \left [\frac{8 (z^2-1)(z^4-6 z^2+1)}{z^8+4 z^6+70z^4+4 z^2+1}\right ] \log^2{z_k}$$</p>

<p>Here things got very messy, but the result is rather unbelievably simple:</p>

<p>$$\operatorname*{Res}_{z=z_k} \left [\frac{8 (z^2-1)(z^4-6 z^2+1)}{z^8+4 z^6+70z^4+4 z^2+1}\right ] = \text{sgn}[\cos{(\arg{z_k})}]$$</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Actually, this is a very simple computation.  Inspired by @sos440, one may express the rational function of $z$ in a very simple form:</p>

<p>$$\frac{8 (z^2-1)(z^4-6 z^2+1)}{z^8+4 z^6+70z^4+4 z^2+1} = -\left [\frac{p'(z)}{p(z)} + \frac{p'(-z)}{p(-z)} \right ]$$</p>

<p>where</p>

<p>$$p(z)=z^4+4 z^3+10 z^2+4 z+1$$</p>

<p>The residue of this function at the poles are then easily seen to be $\pm 1$ according to whether the pole is a zero of $p(z)$ or $p(-z)$.</p>

<p><strong>END EDIT</strong></p>

<p>That is, if the pole has a positive real part, the residue of the fraction is $+1$; if it has a negative real part, the residue is $-1$.</p>

<p>Now consider the log piece.  Expanding the square, we get 3 terms:</p>

<p>$$\log^2{|z_k|} - (\arg{z_k})^2 + i 2 \log{|z_k|} \arg{z_k}$$</p>

<p>Summing over the residues, we find that because of the $\pm1$ contributions above, that the first and third terms sum to zero.  This leaves the second term.  For this, it is crucial that we get the arguments right, as $\arg{z_k} \in [0,2 \pi)$.  Thus, we have</p>

<p>$$\begin{align}I= \int_0^{\infty} dv \frac{8 (v^2-1)(v^4-6 v^2+1)}{v^8+4 v^6+70v^4+4 v^2+1} \log{v} &amp;= \frac12 \sum_{k=1}^8 \text{sgn}[\cos{(\arg{z_k})}] (\arg{z_k})^2 \\ &amp;= \frac12 [2 (\arctan{\sqrt{\phi}})^2 + 2 (2 \pi - \arctan{\sqrt{\phi}})^2 \\ &amp;- 2 (\pi - \arctan{\sqrt{\phi}})^2 - 2 (\pi + \arctan{\sqrt{\phi}})^2]\\ &amp;= 2 \pi^2 -4 \pi \arctan{\sqrt{\phi}} \\ &amp;= 4 \pi \, \text{arccot}{\sqrt{\phi}}\\\end{align}$$</p>

<p>or, alternatively as</p>

<p>span the solution space.</p>

<p>It can be shown that for a homogenous linear system, this method always produces a basis for the solution space of the system.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>I don't understand why this method will always produce a basis for $Ax=0$. Could someone please explain to me why this method will always work? If it helps to explain, I already understand the process of finding the basis of a column space and row space. I also understand why elementary row operations do not alter the null space of a matrix.</p></li>
<li><p>What specific properties of matrices or vector space that I need to be aware of in order to understand why this method works?</p></li>
</ol>
","<p>The null space of $A$ is the set of solutions to $A{\bf x}={\bf 0}$.  To find this, you may take the augmented matrix $[A|0]$ and row reduce to an echelon form. Note that every entry in the rightmost column of this matrix will always be 0 in the row reduction steps. So, we may as well just row reduce $A$, and when finding solutions to $A{\bf x}={\bf 0}$, just keep in mind that the missing column is all 0's.</p>

<p>Suppose after doing this, you obtain
$$
\left[\matrix{1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;-1 \cr 0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;1&amp;0 \cr 0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0 \cr  0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0 \cr }\right]
$$</p>

<p>Now, look at the columns that do not contain any of the leading row entries. These columns correspond to the free variables of the solution set to $A{\bf x}={\bf 0}$  Note that at this point, we know the dimension of the null space is 3, since there are three free variables. That the null space has dimension 3 (and thus the solution set to $A{\bf x}={\bf 0}$ has three free variables) could have also been obtained by knowing that the dimension of the column space is 2 from the rank-nullity theorem.</p>

<p>The ""free columns"" in question are 2,4, and 5. We may assign any value to their corresponding variable. </p>

<p>So, we set $x_2=a$, $x_4=b$, and $x_5=c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are arbitrary.</p>

<p>Now solve for $x_1$ and $x_3$:</p>

<p>The second row tells us $x_3=-x_4=-b$ and the first row tells us $x_1=x_5=c$.</p>

<p>So, the general solution to $A{\bf x}={\bf 0}$ is
$$
{\bf x}=\left[\matrix{c\cr a\cr -b\cr b\cr c}\right]
$$</p>

<p>Let's pause for a second. We know:</p>

<p>1) The null space of $A$ consists of all vectors of the form $\bf x  $ above.</p>

<p>2) The dimension of the null space is 3.</p>

<p>3) We need three independent vectors for our basis for the null space.</p>

<p>So what we can do is take $\bf x$ and split it up as follows:</p>

<p>$$\eqalign{
{\bf x}=\left[\matrix{c\cr a\cr -b\cr b\cr c}\right]
&amp;=\left[ \matrix{0\cr a\cr 0\cr 0\cr 0}\right]+
  \left[\matrix{c\cr 0\cr 0\cr 0\cr c}\right]+
  \left[\matrix{0\cr 0\cr -b\cr b\cr 0}\right]\cr
&amp;=
a\left[ \matrix{0\cr1\cr0\cr 0\cr 0}\right]+
c\left[ \matrix{1\cr 0\cr 0\cr 0\cr 1}\right]+
b\left[ \matrix{0\cr 0\cr -1\cr 1\cr 0}\right]\cr
}
$$ 
Each of the column vectors above are in the null space of $A$. Moreover, they are independent. Thus, they form a basis.</p>

<p>I'm not sure that this answers your question. I did a bit of ""hand waving"" here.  What I glossed over were the facts:</p>

<p>1)The columns of the echelon form of $A$ that do not contain leading row entries correspond to the ""free variables"" to $A{\bf x}={\bf 0}$. If the number of these columns is $r$, then the dimension of the null space is $r$ (again, if you know the dimension of the column space, you can see that the dimension of the null space must be the number of these columns from the rank-nullity theorem).</p>

<p>2) If you split up the general solution to $A{\bf x}={\bf 0}$ as done above, then these vectors will be independent (and span of course since you'll have $r$ of them). </p>

<p>(a): How many such outcomes are possible, given 8 coin tosses?</p>

<p>For each toss, there are two possible outcomes: heads, or tails.</p>

<p>Using the <em>rule of the product</em>, we have that after $8$ tosses, the possible outcomes/sequences is equal to $$\underbrace {2\times 2 \times \cdots \times 2}_{\large 8\; \text{tosses}} = (2)^8= \bf 256$$</p>

<p>(b) Now <em>of these $256$ possible outcomes</em>, we need to determine how many of them are sequences containing </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>exactly three heads</em></strong> (hence, exactly 5 tails), no fewer, no more. So there are eight coins, and we need to compute how many ways we can <em>choose</em> three to be heads: $$ \binom{8}{3} = \dfrac{8!}{3!\,5!} = \bf 56$$</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>at least three heads</em></strong> (hence, at most 5 tails): here we count sequences with exactly 3 heads, and also count sequences with more than three heads. What doesn't count are those sequences containing (zero heads, exactly one head, or exactly two heads). We could compute this as $$\binom 83 + \binom 84 + \cdots + \binom 88$$ but it would be far easier to compute its equivalent, by subtracting from 256 the number of sequences with no head, only one head, and only 2 heads:  $$ 256 - \left(\binom 80 + \binom 81 + \binom 82\right)= 256 - (1 + 8 + 28)= \bf 219$$</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>the same number of heads and tails</em></strong>: An outcome ""counts"" if and only if it contains exactly 4 heads (and hence, exactly 4 tails). Here, we need only compute the number of ways to choose <em>exactly</em> four heads, since the the other four will necessarily then be tails. $$\bf \binom 84 = \dfrac{8!}{4!\,4!}= \bf 70$$</p></li>

"How to check if a set of vectors is a basis","104160","","<p>OK, I am having a real problem with this and I am desperate. </p>

<p>Adding these equations up I get $8a_2 - a_3 = 0$ or $a_3 = 8a_2$ 
so $5a_2 - 32a_2 = 0$ which gets me $a_2 = 0$ and that implies $a_1 = 0 $and$ a_3=0$ as well. </p>

<p>So they are all linearly dependent and thus they are not a basis for $R^3$. </p>

<p>Something tells me that this is wrong. But I am having a hell of a time figuring this stuff out. Please someone help, and I ask: pretend I am the dumbest student you ever met. </p>

","<ol>
<li><p>One method is simply the Euclidean algorithm: 
\begin{align*}
31 &amp;= 4(7) + 3\\
7 &amp;= 2(3) + 1.
\end{align*}
So $ 1 = 7 - 2(3) = 7 - 2(31 - 4(7)) = 9(7) - 2(31)$. Viewing the equation $1 = 9(7) -2(31)$ modulo $31$ gives $ 1 \equiv 9(7)\pmod{31}$, so the multiplicative inverse of $7$ modulo $31$ is $9$. This works in any situation where you want to find the multiplicative inverse of $a$ modulo $m$, provided of course that such a thing exists (i.e., $\gcd(a,m) = 1$). The Euclidean Algorithm gives you a constructive way of finding $r$ and $s$ such that $ar+ms = \gcd(a,m)$, but if you manage to find $r$ and $s$ some other way, that will do it too. As soon as you have $ar+ms=1$, that means that $r$ is the modular inverse of $a$ modulo $m$, since the equation immediately yields $ar\equiv 1 \pmod{m}$. </p></li>
<li><p>Another method is to play with fractions (Gauss's method):
$$\frac{1}{7} = \frac{1\times 5}{7\times 5} = \frac{5}{35} = \frac{5}{4} = \frac{5\times 8}{4\times 8} = \frac{40}{32} = \frac{9}{1}.$$
Here, you reduce modulo $31$ where appropriate, and the only thing to be careful of is that you should only multiply and divide by things relatively prime to the modulus. Here, since $31$ is prime, this is easy. At each step, I just multiplied by the smallest number that would yield a reduction; so first I multiplied by $5$ because that's the smallest multiple of $7$ that is larger than $32$, and later I multiplied by $8$ because it was the smallest multiple of $4$ that is larger than $32$.  <em>Added:</em> As Bill notes, the method may fail for composite moduli. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Both of the above methods work for general modulus, not just for a prime modulus (though Method 2 may fail in that situation); of course, you can only find multiplicative inverses if the number is relatively prime to the modulus.</p>

<p><strong>Update.</strong> Yes, your method for general linear congruences is the standard one.  We have a very straightforward method for solving congruences of the form $$ax \equiv b\pmod{m},$$
namely, it has solutions if and only if $\gcd(a,m)|b$, in which case it has exactly $\gcd(a,m)$ solutions modulo $m$. </p>

<p>To solve such equations, you first consider the case with $\gcd(a,m)=1$, in which case $ax\equiv b\pmod{m}$ is solved either by finding the multiplicative inverse of $a$ modulo $m$, or as I did in method $2$ above looking at $\frac{b}{a}$. </p>

<p>Once you know how to solve them in the case where $\gcd(a,m)=1$, you can take the general case of $\gcd(a,m) = d$, and from
$$ax\equiv b\pmod{m}$$
go to
$$\frac{a}{d}x \equiv \frac{b}{d}\pmod{\frac{m}{d}},$$
to get the unique solution $\mathbf{x}_0$. Once you have that unique solution, you get all solutions to the original congruence by considering
$$\mathbf{x}_0,\quad \mathbf{x}_0 + \frac{m}{d},\quad \mathbf{x}_0 + \frac{2m}{d},\quad\ldots, \mathbf{x}_0 + \frac{(d-1)m}{d}.$$</p>

<p>If $B=\begin{bmatrix} 5 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 5\end{bmatrix}$, then $p_B(x) = (x-5)^2$, hence the eigenvalue $5$ has algebraic multiplicity $2$. Since $\dim \ker (5I-B) = 2$, the geometric multiplicity is also $2$.</p>

where the diagonal elements of $V$ are the eigenvalues $(0,0,-2)$ of $A$ using

where $P = (v_1 \quad v_2 \quad  v_3)$ is invertible. This only happens if $A$ has $n$ linearly-independent eignevectors $v_1, v_2, v_3.$ In this case, although $\lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = 0$, you have a non-singular

<p>Sample
Population</p>

<p>I didn't change it, but I kept getting the wrong results for the standard deviation. When I changed it to ""Population"" type, I started getting correct results!</p>

<p>Why is that? As far as I know, there is only one type of standard deviation which is to calculate the root-mean-square of the values!</p>

<p>Did I miss something?</p>
","<p>There are, in fact, two different formulas for standard deviation here: The population standard deviation $\sigma$ and the sample standard deviation $s$.</p>

<p>If $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_N$ denote all $N$ values from a population, then the (population) standard deviation is 
$$\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \mu)^2},$$
where $\mu$ is the mean of the population.  </p>

<p>If $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_N$ denote $N$ values from a sample, however, then the (sample) standard deviation is 
$$s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \bar{x})^2},$$
where $\bar{x}$ is the mean of the sample.</p>

<p>The reason for the change in formula with the sample is this: When you're calculating $s$ you are normally using $s^2$ (the sample variance) to estimate $\sigma^2$ (the population variance).  The problem, though, is that if you don't know $\sigma$ you generally don't know the population mean $\mu$, either, and so you have to use $\bar{x}$ in the place in the formula where you normally would use $\mu$.  Doing so introduces a slight bias into the calculation: Since $\bar{x}$ is calculated from the sample, the values of $x_i$ are on average closer to $\bar{x}$ than they would be to $\mu$, and so the sum of squares $\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \bar{x})^2$ turns out to be smaller on average than $\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \mu)^2$.  It just so happens that that bias can be corrected by dividing by $N-1$ instead of $N$.  (Proving this is a standard exercise in an advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate course in statistical theory.)  The technical term here is that $s^2$ (because of the division by $N-1$) is an <em>unbiased estimator</em> of $\sigma^2$. </p>

<p>Another way to think about it is that with a sample you have $N$ independent pieces of information.  However, since $\bar{x}$ is the average of those $N$ pieces, if you know $x_1 - \bar{x}, x_2 - \bar{x}, \ldots, x_{N-1} - \bar{x}$, you can figure out what $x_N - \bar{x}$ is.  So when you're squaring and adding up the residuals $x_i - \bar{x}$, there are really only $N-1$ independent pieces of information there.  So in that sense perhaps dividing by $N-1$ rather than $N$ makes sense.  The technical term here is that there are $N-1$ <em>degrees of freedom</em> in the residuals $x_i - \bar{x}$.</p>

","<p>As @Yemon Choi showed in the first question, without any hypothesis the answer is negative since $P(X^2&lt;0)=0$ whereas $P(U&lt;0)\neq 0$ if $U$ is Gaussian.</p>

<p>For the second question the answer is also no. Take $X$ and $Y$ two Gaussian random variables with mean $0$ and variance $1$. Since they have the same variance, $X-Y$ and $X+Y$ are independent Gaussian random variables. Put $Z:=\frac{X^2-Y^2}2=\frac{X-Y}{\sqrt 2}\frac{X+Y}{\sqrt 2}$. Then $Z$ is the product of two independent Gaussian, but the characteristic function of $Z$ is $\varphi_Z(t)=\frac 1{\sqrt{1+t^2}}$, which is not the characteristic function of a Gaussian.</p>

<p>Another  way is to calculate the perpendicular distances of $P(x,y)$ from all the 4 lines $AB,CD, AD,BC$</p>

<p>To be inside the rectangle,
   the perpendicular distances from  $AB, P_{AB}$(say) and from $CD, P_{CD}$(say) must be less than $|AD|=|BC|$  and the perpendicular distances from  $AD, P_{AD}$(say) and from $BC, P_{BC}$(say) must be less than $|CD|=|AB|$.

","<p>For positive bases $a$, you have the general rule

<p>This follows from the fact that exponentials and logarithms are inverses of each other, and that the logarithm has the property that
$$\ln(x^r) = r\ln(x).$$</p>

<p>So you have, for example,
\begin{align*}
(2.14)^{2.14} &amp;= e^{\ln\left((2.14)^{2.14}\right)} &amp;\quad&amp;\mbox{(because $e^{\ln x}=x$)}\\

$$a^b = e^{\ln(a^b)} = e^{b\ln a}.$$</p>

<p>In fact, this is formula can be taken as the <em>definition</em> of $a^b$ for $a\gt 0$ and arbitrary exponent $b$ (that is, not an integer, not a rational).</p>

"Difference between Fourier series and Fourier transformation","93564","","<p>Whats the difference between Fourier transformations and Fourier Series? As I've been working with Fourier Series in my maths lectures yet a friend of mine also doing engineering has been working with Fourier Transformations. Are they the same where a transformation is just used when its applied and not used in pure mathematics?</p>
","<p>The Fourier series is used to represent a periodic function by a discrete sum of complex exponentials, while the Fourier transform is then used to represent a general, nonperiodic function by a continuous superposition or integral of complex exponentials. The Fourier transform can be viewed as the limit of the Fourier series of a function with the period approaches to infinity, so the limits of integration change from one period to $(-\infty,\infty)$.</p>

<p>In a classical approach it would not be possible to use the Fourier transform for a periodic function which cannot be in $\mathbb{L}_1(-\infty,\infty)$. The use of generalized functions, however, frees us of that restriction and makes it possible to look at the Fourier transform of a periodic function. It can be shown that the Fourier series coefficients of a periodic function are sampled values of the Fourier transform of one period of the function.</p>

","<p>In this case the subscripts tell you which term of the sequence you’re looking at: $F_n$ is the $n$-th term of the sequence. This particular sequence is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number"">Fibonacci sequence</a>, which is defined by setting $F_0=0$ and $F_1=1$, thereby establishing the zero-th and first terms, and defining the rest <em>recursively</em> by the relationship that you quoted in your question: $$F_n=F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}\tag{1}$$ for all $n&gt;1$. The formula $(1)$ then says that the $n$-th Fibonacci number is the sum of the $(n-1)$-st and $(n-2)$-nd Fibonacci numbers. When $n=2$, that says that $$F_2=F_1+F_0=1+0=1\;;$$ then when $n=3$ it says that $$F_3=F_2+F_1=1+1=2\;,$$ when $n=4$ it says that $$F_4=F_3+F_2=2+1=3\;,$$ and so on.</p>

<p>In this way we have an infinite sequence $\langle F_n:n\in\Bbb N\rangle=\langle0,1,1,2,3,5,8,\dots\rangle$. In general $\langle x_n:n\in\Bbb N\rangle$ is an infinite sequence $\langle x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3,\dots\rangle$, the subscripts indicating the position of each term in the sequence. In the sequence the order matters. That is, although the <em>sets</em> $\{x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3,\dots\}$ and $\{x_1,x_0,x_3,x_2,\dots\}$ are identical, the <em>sequences</em> $\langle x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3,\dots\rangle$ and $\langle x_1,x_0,x_3,x_2,\dots\rangle$ are not.</p>

<p>You can think of these subscripts simply as labels to keep the positions straight, just as we can use $\langle x_1,x_2,x_3\rangle$ for an ordered triple representing a point in $3$-space. From a more formal point of view, however, a sequence is actually just a function. For example, the sequence $$\langle x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3,\dots\rangle$$ of real numbers is a shorthand for the function $$x:\Bbb N\to\Bbb R:n\mapsto x_n\;,$$ so that we could just as well write $x(n)$ as $x_n$.</p>

<p>$$x^2+y(x)^2=r^2$$</p>

<p>We aren't always this lucky when we solve differential equations that show up in practice.

<blockquote>
  <p>Question: What are the practical applications of the Taylor Series? Whether it's in a mathematical context, or in real world examples. </p>
</blockquote>
","<p>One reason is that we can approximate solutions to differential equations this way: For example, if we have</p>

<p>$$y''-x^2y=e^x$$</p>

<p>To solve this for $y$ would be difficult, if at all possible. But by representing $y$  as a Taylor series $\sum a_nx^n$, we can shuffle things around and determine the coefficients of this Taylor series, allowing us to approximate the solution around a desired point.</p>

<p>It's also useful for determining various infinite sums. For example:</p>

<p>$$\frac 1 {1-x}=\sum_{n=0}^\infty x^n$$
$$\frac 1 {1+x}=\sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^nx^n$$
Integrate:
$$\ln(1+x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^nx^{n+1}}{n+1}$$
Substituting $x=1$ gives</p>

<p>$$\ln 2=1-\frac12+\frac13-\frac14+\frac15-\frac16\cdots$$</p>

<p>There are also applications in physics. If a system under a conservative force (one with an energy function associated with it, like gravity or electrostatic force) is at a stable equilibrium point $x_0$, then there are no net forces and the energy function is concave upwards (the energy being higher on either side is essentially what makes it stable). In terms of taylor series, the energy function $U$ centred around this point is of the form</p>

<p>$$U(x)=U_0+k_1(x-x_0)^2+k_2(x-x_0)^3\cdots$$</p>

<p>Where $U_0$ is the energy at the minimum $x=x_0$. For small displacements the high order terms will be very small and can be ignored. So we can approximate this by only looking at the first two terms:</p>

<p>$$U(x)\approx U_0+k_1(x-x_0)^2\cdots$$</p>

<p>Now force is the negative derivative of energy (forces send you from high to low energy, proportionally to the energy drop). Applying this, we get that</p>

<p>$$F=ma=mx''=-2k_1(x-x_0)$$</p>

<p>Rephrasing in terms of $y=x-x_0$:</p>

<p>$$my''=-2k_1y$$</p>

<p>Which is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator. Basically, for small displacements around <em>any</em> stable equilibrium the system behaves approximately like an oscillating spring, with sinusoidal behaviour. So under certain conditions you can replace a potentially complicated system by another one that's very well understood and well-studied. You can see this in a pendulum, for example.</p>

<p>As a final point, they're also useful in determining limits:</p>

<p>$$\lim_{x\to0}\frac{\sin x-x}{x^3}$$
$$\lim_{x\to0}\frac{x-\frac16x^3+\frac 1{120}x^5\cdots-x}{x^3}$$
$$\lim_{x\to0}-\frac16+\frac 1{120}x^2\cdots$$
$$-\frac16$$</p>

<p>which otherwise would have been relatively difficult to determine. Because polynomials behave so much more nicely than other functions, we can use taylor series to determine useful information that would be very difficult, if at all possible, to determine directly.</p>

<p>EDIT: I almost forgot to mention the granddaddy:</p>

<p>$$e^x=1+x+\frac12x^2+\frac16x^3+\frac1{24}x^4\cdots$$
$$e^{ix}=1+ix-\frac12x^2-i\frac16x^3+\frac1{24}x^4\cdots$$
$$=1-\frac12x^2+\frac1{24}x^4\cdots + ix-i\frac16x^3+i\frac1{120}x^5\cdots$$
$$=\cos x+i\sin x$$
$$e^{ix}=\cos x+i\sin x$$</p>

<p>My question is: are there any rules of thumb (preferably with a logical reason behind it) of when to use which?</p>
","<p>Always do a $u$-sub if you can; if you cannot, consider integration by parts.</p>

<p>A $u$-sub can be done whenever you have something containing a function (we'll call this $g$), and that something is multiplied by the derivative of $g$.  That is, if you have $\int f(g(x))g'(x)dx$, use a u-sub.</p>

<p>Integration by parts is whenever you have two functions multiplied together--one that you can integrate, one that you can differentiate.</p>

<p>My strategy is to try to ""play it out"" in my mind and try to see which one will work better.  The best way to get better at these sorts of integrals is to practice large sets of each type.  Then, you start to think ""Oh--this looks like a u-sub!"" or, ""maybe by-parts is better for this.""  <strong>Practice is really the best way to get better at recognizing each type.</strong></p>

"What's an intuitive way to think about the determinant?","91612","","<p>In my linear algebra class, we just talked about determinants. So far I’ve been understanding the material okay, but now I’m very confused. I get that when the determinant is zero, the matrix doesn’t have an inverse. I can find the determinant of a $2\times 2$ matrix by the formula. Our teacher showed us how to compute the determinant of an $N \times N$ matrix by breaking it up into the determinants of smaller matrices, and apparently there is a way by summing over a bunch of permutations. But the notation is really hard for me and I don’t really know what’s going on with them anymore. Can someone help me figure out what a determinant is, intuitively, and how all those definitions of it are related?</p>
","<p>Your trouble with determinants is pretty common. They’re a hard thing to teach well, too, for two main reasons that I can see: the formulas you learn for computing them are messy and complicated, and there’s no “natural” way to interpret the value of the determinant, the way it’s easy to interpret the derivatives you do in calculus at first as the slope of the tangent line. It’s hard to believe things like the invertibility condition you’ve stated when it’s not even clear what the numbers mean and where they come from.</p>

<p>Rather than show that the many usual definitions are all the same by comparing them to each other, I’m going to state some general properties of the determinant that I claim are enough to specify uniquely what number you should get when you put in a given matrix. Then it’s not too bad to check that all of the definitions for determinant that you’ve seen satisfy those properties I’ll state.</p>

<p>The first thing to think about if you want an “abstract” definition of the determinant to unify all those others is that it’s not an array of numbers with bars on the side. What we’re really looking for is a function that takes N vectors (the N columns of the matrix) and returns a number. Let’s assume we’re working with real numbers for now.</p>

<p>Remember how those operations you mentioned change the value of the determinant? </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Switching two rows or columns changes the sign. </p></li>
<li><p>Multiplying one row by a constant multiplies the whole determinant by that constant. </p></li>
<li><p>The general fact that number two draws from: the determinant is <em>linear in each row</em>. That is, if you think of it as a function $\det: \mathbb{R}^{n^2} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, then $$ \det(a \vec v_1 +b \vec w_1 , \vec v_2 ,\ldots,\vec v_n ) = a \det(\vec v_1,\vec v_2,\ldots,\vec v_n) + b \det(\vec w_1, \vec v_2, \ldots,\vec v_n),$$ and the corresponding condition in each other slot.</p></li>
<li><p>The determinant of the identity matrix $I$ is $1$.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I claim that these facts are enough to define a <em>unique function</em> that takes in N vectors (each of length N) and returns a real number, the determinant of the matrix given by those vectors. I won’t prove that, but I’ll show you how it helps with some other interpretations of the determinant.</p>

<p>In particular, there’s a nice geometric way to think of a determinant. Consider the unit cube in N dimensional space: the set of vectors of length N with coordinates 0 or 1 in each spot. The determinant of the linear transformation (matrix) T is the <em>signed volume of the region gotten by applying T to the unit cube</em>. (Don’t worry too much if you don’t know what the “signed” part means, for now).</p>

<p>How does that follow from our abstract definition?</p>

<p>Well, if you apply the identity to the unit cube, you get back the unit cube. And the volume of the unit cube is 1.</p>

<p>If you stretch the cube by a constant factor in one direction only, the new volume is that constant. And if you stack two blocks together aligned on the same direction, their combined volume is the sum of their volumes: this all shows that the signed volume we have is linear in each coordinate when considered as a function of the input vectors.</p>

<p>Finally, when you switch two of the vectors that define the unit cube, you flip the orientation. (Again, this is something to come back to later if you don’t know what that means).</p>

<p>So there are ways to think about the determinant that aren’t symbol-pushing. If you’ve studied multivariable calculus, you could think about, with this geometric definition of determinant, why determinants (the Jacobian) pop up when we change coordinates doing integration. Hint: a derivative is a linear approximations of the associated function, and consider a “differential volume element” in your starting coordinate system.</p>

<p>It’s not too much work to check that the area of the parallelogram formed by vectors $(a,b)$ and $(c,d)$ is $\Big|{}^{a\;b}_{c\;d}\Big|$
either: you might try that to get a sense for things.</p>

"Tangent Line to the curve that is Parallel to the line","91211","","<p>Find the equation of the tangent line to the curve $ y=1-x^2$ that is parallel to the line $2x-4y=8.$</p>

<p>I really don't know how to start this problem, can you help me please to solve this problem? Thank you.</p>
","<ul>
<li><p>Determine the slope of the <em>given</em> line: Since we want the tangent line to be parallel to the line $2x - 4y = 8$, we need for it to have the <strong>same slope</strong>. We can rewrite the equation in slope-intercept form to easily find slope: $4y= 2x- 8\iff y = \frac 12 x - 2$. Hence the desired slope of our line is $m = \frac 12$.</p></li>
<li><p>Then find the derivative of $y = 1-x^2$ and set it equal to the desired slope. $y' = -2x$. So put $-2x = \frac 12$ </p></li>
<li><p>Solve for the value of $x$. $$-2x = \frac 12 \iff x = -\frac{1}{4}$$</p></li>
<li><p>That will give you the x-coordinate of a point on the desired line. Find the corresponding y-coordinate, and you'll have both coordinates of a point on the desired line. $$y = 1 - x^2 \implies y\left(-\frac 14\right) = 1 - \frac 1{16} = \frac {15}{16}$$</p></li>
<li><p>We know the slope of the desired line is equal to $\frac 12$, and we now have a point on the desired line, as well as on the given curve: i.e., the point of tangency $\left(-\frac 14, \frac {15}{16}\right)$.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the point-slope form to obtain the equation of the desired line. Given slope $m$ and a point on the desired line,$(x_0, y_0)$, the equation of the line is given by $$(y-y_0) = m(x-x_0)$$</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This gives us: $$y - \frac {15}{16} = \frac 12\left(x + \frac 14\right) \iff 16y - 15= 8x + 2 \iff 8x - 16y= -17$$</p>

"Proving a function is onto and one to one","89024","","<p>I'm reading up on how to prove if a function (represented by a formula) is one-to-one or onto, and I'm having some trouble understanding.</p>

<p>To prove if a function is one-to-one, it says that I have to show that for elements $a$ and $b$ in set $A$, if $f(a) = f(b)$, then $a = b$. I understand this to mean that if two elements in a domain map to the the same element in a codomain, then for the function to be one-to-one, they must be the same element because by definition, a one-to-one function has at most one element in the domain mapped to a particular element in the co-domain. Did I understand this correctly? </p>

<p>Then to prove that the function is onto, I'm reading an example that says ""let's prove that $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow  \mathbb{R}$ defined by $f(x) = 5x+2$ is onto, where $\mathbb{R}$ denotes the real numbers. We let $y$ be a typical element of the codomain and set up the equation $y =f(x)$. then, $y = 5x+2$ and solving for $x$ we get $x ={y-2\over 5}$. Since $y$ is a real number, then ${y-2\over 5}$ is a real number and $f({y-2\over 5})=5({y-2\over 5})+2=y.$</p>

<p>I'm not really seeing how that proves anything, so can anybody explain this to me?</p>
","<p>Yes, your understanding of a <strong><em>one-to-one</em></strong> function is correct.</p>

<p>A function is <strong><em>onto</em></strong> if and only if for every $y$ in the codomain, there is an $x$ in the domain such that $f(x) = y$.</p>

<p>So in the example you give, $f:\mathbb R \to \mathbb R,\quad f(x) = 5x+2$, the domain and codomain are the same set: $\mathbb R.\;$ Since, for every real number $y\in \mathbb R,\,$ there is an $\,x\in \mathbb R\,$ such that $f(x) = y$, the function is onto. The example you include shows an explicit way to determine which $x$ maps to a particular $y$, by solving for $x$ in terms of $y.$ That way, we can pick any $y$, solve for $f'(y) = x$, and know the value of $x$ which the original function maps to that $y$. </p>

<p>Side note:</p>

<p>Note that $f'(y) = f^{-1}(x)$ when we swap variables. We are guaranteed that every function $f$ that is onto and one-to-one has an inverse $f^{-1}$, a function such that $f(f^{-1}(x)) = f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$.</p>

<em>Can we do this just by involving matrix multiplication ?</em></p>
","<p>Another approach is called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation_by_squaring"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">exponentiation by squaring</a>. It still requires you to multiply out matrices like normal, but you only need $O(\log n)$ such multiplications.</p>

<p>This approach is most useful if you want a few values for $A^k$ with $k$ large. But if you want the values of $A^k$ for a sequence of values $k=0,1,\dots$ it is isn't much help.</p>

<hr>

<p>A fun way to use parallelism, if you need the sequence $A^0,A^1,\dots,$ is to encode <em>all</em> $A^k$ in a generating function:</p>

<p>$$g_A(t)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} A^kt^k=\frac{1}{I-At}$$
which converges for $t\|A\|&lt;1$.</p>

<p>Now, take the characteristic polynomial $p_A(x)$ (you can use the minimal polyomial, if you want - it will be much faster of the degree of the minimal polynomial is small.) Formally divide $p_A(x)$ by $xI-A$ to get $p_A(x)=(x-A)q(x),$ where the coefficients of $q$ are polynomials of $A$.</p>

<p>Then:</p>

<p>$$g_A(t)=\frac{1}{t}\frac{q(t^{-1}I)}{p_A(t^{-1})}$$</p>

<p>Or:</p>

<p>$$g_A(t)=\frac{t^{n-1}q(t^{-1}I)}{t^n p_A(t^{-1})}$$</p>

<p>The denominator is a real or complex polynomial in $t$ and the numerator is a polynomial in $t$ with coefficients polynomials of degree $&lt;n$ in $A$.</p>

<p>This means that for each $i,j$ we have the first $n$ values if $(A^k)_{i,j},$ with the denominator allowing us to compute $(A^{n+k})_{ij}$ as a linear combination from the values of $(A^{k+p})_{ij}$ for $p=0,1,\dots,n-1.$</p>

<p>This lets a calculate the $i,j$ coordinates separately, if you need a large sequence of values.</p>

<p>For example, if $p_A(x)=x^3-x-1$ then $q(x)=x^2+Ax+(A^2-I)$ and you get:</p>

And please also give me an example of how they are used?</p>
","<p>I work in the field of applied math, so I will give you the point of view of an applied mathematician.</p>

<p>I do numerical PDEs. Basically, I take a differential equation (an equation whose solution is not a number, but a function, and that involves the function and its derivatives) and, instead of finding an analytical solution, I try to find an approximation of the value of the solution at some points (think of a grid of points). It's a bit more deep than this, but it's not the point here. The point is that eventually I find myself having to solve a linear system of equations which usually is of huge size (order of millions). It is a pretty huge number of equations to solve, I would say.</p>

<p>Where do matrices come into play? Well, as you know (or maybe not, I don't know) a linear system can be seen in matrix-vector form as</p>

<p>$$\text{A}\underline{x}=\underline{b}$$
where $\underline{x}$ contains the unknowns, A the coefficients of the equations and $\underline{b}$ contains the values of the right hand sides of the equations.
For instance for the system</p>

<p>$$\begin{cases}2x_1+x_2=3\\4x_1-x_2=1\end{cases}$$
we have</p>

<p>$$\text{A}=\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
2 &amp; 1\\
4 &amp; -1
\end{array}
\right],\qquad \underline{x}=
\left[\begin{array}{c}
x_1\\
x_2
\end{array}
\right]\qquad \underline{b}=
\left[\begin{array}{c}
3\\
1
\end{array}
\right]$$</p>

<p>For what I said so far, in this context matrices look just like a fancy and compact way to write down a system of equations, mere tables of numbers.</p>

<p>However, in order to solve this system fast is not enough to use a calculator with a big RAM and/or a high clock rate (CPU). Of course, the more powerful the calculator is, the faster you will get the solution. But sometimes, faster might still mean <strong>days</strong> (or more) if you tackle the problem in the wrong way, even if you are on a Blue Gene.</p>

<p>So, to reduce the computational costs, you have to come up with a good algorithm, a smart idea. But in order to do so, you need to exploit some property or some structure of your linear system. These properties are encoded somehow in the coefficients of the matrix A. Therefore, studying matrices and their properties is of crucial importance in trying to improve linear solvers efficiency. Recognizing that the matrix enjoys a particular property might be crucial to develop a fast algorithm or even to prove that a solution exists, or that the solution has some nice property.</p>

<p>For instance, consider the linear system</p>

<p>$$\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
2 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
-1 &amp; 2 &amp; -1 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; -1 &amp; 2 &amp; -1\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 2
\end{array}
\right]
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
x_1\\
x_2\\
x_3\\
x_4
\end{array}
\right]=
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
1\\
1\\
1\\
1
\end{array}
\right]$$
which corresponds (in equation form) to</p>

<p>$$\begin{cases}
2x_1-x_2=1\\
-x_1+2x_2-x_3=1\\
-x_2+2x_3-x_4=1\\
-x_3+2x_4=1
\end{cases}$$</p>

<p>Just giving a quick look to the matrix, I can claim that this system has a solution and, moreover, the solution is non-negative (meaning that all the components of the solution are non-negative). I'm pretty sure you wouldn't be able to draw this conclusion just looking at the system without trying to solve it. I can also claim that to solve this system you need only 25 operations (one operation being a single addition/subtraction/division/multiplication). If you construct a larger system with the same pattern (2 on the diagonal, -1 on the upper and lower diagonal) and put a right hand side with only positive entries, I can still claim that the solution exists and it's positive and the number of operations needed to solve it is only $8n-7$, where $n$ is the size of the system.</p>

</ol>

<p>Assuming that $R$ stands for the real numbers, we check.</p>

<p><strong>Is $g$ injective?</strong></p>

<p>Take $x,y\in R$ and assume that $g(x)=g(y)$. Therefore $2f(x)+3=2f(y)+3$. We can cancel out the $3$ and divide by $2$, then we get $f(x)=f(y)$. Since $f$ is a bijection, then it is injective, and we have that $x=y$. </p>

<p><strong>Is $g$ surjective?</strong></p>

<p>Take some $y\in R$, we want to show that $y=g(x)$ that is, $y=2f(x)+3$. Subtract $3$ and divide by $2$, again we have $\frac{y-3}2=f(x)$. As before, if $f$ was surjective then we are about done, simply denote $w=\frac{y-3}2$, since $f$ is surjective there is some $x$ such that $f(x)=w$. Show now that $g(x)=y$ as wanted.</p>

<hr>

<p>Alternatively, you can use theorems. What sort of theorems? The composition of bijections is a bijection. If $f$ is a bijection, show that $h_1(x)=2x$ is a bijection, and show that $h_2(x)=x+2$ is also a bijection. Now we have that $g=h_2\circ h_1\circ f$ and is therefore a bijection.</p>

<p>Of course this is again under the assumption that $f$ is a bijection.</p>

"How to find solutions of linear Diophantine ax + by = c?","88046","","<p>I want to find a set of integer solutions of Diophantine equation: $ax + by = c$, and apparently $\gcd(a,b)|c$. Then by what formula can I use to find $x$ and $y$ ? </p>

<p>I tried to play around with it:<br>
$x = (c - by)/a$, hence $a|(c - by)$.   </p>

<p>$a$, $c$ and $b$ are known. So to obtain integer solution for $a$, then $c - by = ak$, and I lost from here, because $y = (c - ak)/b$. I kept repeating this routine and could not find a way to get rid of it? Any hint?</p>

<p>Thanks,<br>
Chan</p>
","<p>The diophantine equation $ax+by = c$ has solutions if and only if $\gcd(a,b)|c$. If so, it has infinitely many solutions, and any one solution can be used to generate all the other ones.</p>

<p>To see this, note that the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ divides both $ax$ and $by$, hence divides $c$ if there is a solution. This gives the necessity of the condition <strike>(which you have backwards).</strike> <em>(fixed in edits)</em></p>

<p>The converse is actually a <em>constructive</em> proof, that you can find in pretty much every elementary number theory course or book, and which is essentially the same as yunone's answer above (but without dividing through first).</p>

<p>From the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Euclidean_algorithm"">Extended Euclidean Algorithm</a>, given any integers $a$ and $b$ you can find integers $s$ and $t$ such that $as+bt = \gcd(a,b)$; the numbers $s$ and $t$ are not unique, but you only need one pair. Once you find $s$ and $t$, since we are assuming that $\gcd(a,b)$ divides $c$, there exists an integer $k$ such that $\gcd(a,b)k = c$. Multiplying $as+bt=\gcd(a,b)$ through by $k$ you get
$$a(sk) + b(tk) = \gcd(a,b)k = c.$$</p>

<p>So this gives one solution, with $x=sk$ and $y=tk$. </p>

<p>Now suppose that $ax_1 + by_1 = c$ is a solution, and $ax+by=c$ is some other solution. Taking the difference between the two, we get
$$a(x_1-x) + b(y_1-y) = 0.$$
Therefore, $a(x_1-x) = b(y-y_1)$. That means that $a$ divides $b(y-y_1)$, and therefore $\frac{a}{\gcd(a,b)}$ divides $y-y_1$. Therefore, $y = y_1 + r\frac{a}{\gcd(a,b)}$ for some integer $r$. Substituting into the equation $a(x_1-x) = b(y-y_1)$ gives
$$a(x_1 - x) = rb\left(\frac{a}{\gcd(a,b)}\right)$$
which yields
$$\gcd(a,b)a(x_1-x) = rba$$
or $x = x_1 - r\frac{b}{\gcd(a,b)}$. </p>

<p>Thus, if $ax_1+by_1 = c$ is any solution, then all solutions are of the form
$$x = x_1 - r\frac{b}{\gcd(a,b)},\qquad y = y_1 + r\frac{a}{\gcd(a,b)}$$
exactly as yunone said.</p>

<p><hr/>
To give you an example of this in action, suppose we want to find all integer solutions to $$258x + 147y = 369.$$</p>

<p>First, we use the Euclidean Algorithm to find $\gcd(147,258)$; the parenthetical equation on the far right is how we will use this equality after we are done with the computation.
\begin{align*}
258 &amp;= 147(1) + 111 &amp;\quad&amp;\mbox{(equivalently, $111=258 - 147$)}\\
147 &amp;= 111(1) + 36&amp;&amp;\mbox{(equivalently, $36 = 147 - 111$)}\\
111 &amp;= 36(3) + 3&amp;&amp;\mbox{(equivalently, $3 = 111-3(36)$)}\\
36 &amp;= 3(12).
\end{align*}
So $\gcd(147,258)=3$. Since $3|369$, the equation has integral solutions.</p>

<p>Then we find a way of writing $3$ as a linear combination of $147$ and $258$, using the Euclidean algorithm computation above, and the equalities on the far right. We have:
\begin{align*}
3 &amp;= 111 - 3(36)\\
&amp;= 111 - 3(147 - 111) = 4(111) - 3(147)\\
&amp;= 4(258 - 147) - 3(147)\\
&amp;= 4(258) -7(147).
\end{align*}
Then, we take $258(4) + 147(-7)=3$, and multiply through by $123$; why $123$? Because $3\times 123 = 369$. We get:
$$258(492) + 147(-861) = 369.$$
So one solution is $x=492$ and $y=-861$. All other solutions will have the form
\begin{align*}
x &amp;= 492 - \frac{147r}{3} = 492 - 49r,\\
y &amp;= -861 + \frac{258r}{3} =86r - 861, &amp;\qquad&amp;r\in\mathbb{Z}.
\end{align*}
You can reduce those constants by making a simple change of variable. For example, if we let $r=t+10$, then 
\begin{align*}
x &amp;= 492 - 49(t+10) = 2 - 49t,\\
y &amp;= 86(t+10) - 861 = 86t - 1,&amp;\qquad&amp;t\in\mathbb{Z}.
\end{align*}</p>

"Real world application of Fourier series","87736","","<p>What are some real world applications of Fourier series? Particularly the complex Fourier integrals? </p>
","<p>It turns out that (almost) any kind of a wave can be written as a sum of sines and cosines. So for example, if I was to record your voice for one second saying something, I can find its fourier series which may look something like this for example</p>

<p>$$\textrm{voice} = \sin(x)+\frac{1}{10}\sin(2x)+\frac{1}{100}\sin(3x)+...$$</p>

<p>and <a href=""http://www.intmath.com/fourier-series/fourier-graph-applet.php"">this interactive module</a> shows you how when you add sines and/or cosines the graph of cosines and sines becomes closer and closer to the original graph we are trying to approximate.</p>

<p>The really cool thing about fourier series is that first, almost any kind of a wave can be approximated. Second, when fourier series converge, they converge very fast.</p>

<p>So one of many many applications is compression. Everyone's favorite MP3 format uses this for audio compression. You take a sound, expand its fourier series. It'll most likely be an infinite series BUT it converges so fast that taking the first few terms is enough to reproduce the original sound. The rest of the terms can be ignored because they add so little that a human ear can likely tell no difference. So I just save the first few terms and then use them to reproduce the sound whenever I want to listen to it and it takes much less memory.</p>

"In how many ways can four students be chosen from a group of 12 students?","87572","","<p>Myself and my Math teacher are at a disagreement in to what the proper method of solving the question <em>In how many ways can four students be chosen from a group of 12 students?</em> is.</p>

<p>The question comes straight out of a Math revision sheet from a Math book distributed under the national curriculum. The options it gives for answers are:</p>

<li>48</li>
<li>495</li>
<li>11880</li>

<p>As we are currently learning Permutations and Combinations, my above interpretation is that it is asking for a <strong>Combination without repetition</strong> or $\frac{(n+r-1)!}{r!(n-1)!}$ which gives you the amount of combinations without repetition (as you cannot pick the same student twice.) Now my teacher argues that the answer the book provides is correct. The books answer simply says to use $^{n}C_{r}$ or $\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$.</p>

<p>What is the correct method of answering this? The book states <em>3. 495</em> is the answer.</p>
","<p>You have 12 choices for the first student chosen, 11 choices for the next, then 10, then 9. However, this over-counts everything by a factor of 4! (the number of ways in which four objects can be arranged with regard to order).</p>

"Why study linear algebra?","87214","","<p>Simply as the title says. I've done some research, but still haven't arrived at an answer I am satisfied with. I know the answer varies in different fields, but in general, why would someone study linear algebra?</p>
","<p>Linear algebra is vital in multiple areas of <strong>science</strong> in general. Because linear equations are so easy to solve, practically every area of modern science contains models where equations are approximated by linear equations (using Taylor expansion arguments) and solving for the system helps the theory develop. Beginning to make a list wouldn't even be relevant ; you and I have no idea how people abuse of the power of linear algebra to approximate solutions to equations. Since in most cases, solving equations is a synonym of solving a practical problem, this can be VERY useful. Just for this reason, linear algebra has a reason to exist, and it is enough reason for any scientific to know linear algebra.</p>

<p>More specifically, in mathematics, linear algebra has, of course, its use in abstract algebra ; vector spaces arise in many different areas of algebra such as group theory, ring theory, module theory, representation theory, Galois theory, and much more. Understanding the tools of linear algebra gives one the ability to understand those theories better, and some theorems of linear algebra require also an understanding of those theories ; they are linked in many different intrinsic ways.</p>

<p>Outside of algebra, a big part of analysis, called <em>functional analysis</em>, is actually the infinite-dimensional version of linear algebra. In infinite dimension, most of the finite-dimension theorems break down in a very interesting way ; some of our intuition is preserved, but most of it breaks down. Of course, none of the algebraic intuition goes away, but most of the analytic part does ; closed balls are never compact, norms are not always equivalent, and the structure of the space changes a lot depending on the norm you use. Hence even for someone studying analysis, understanding linear algebra is vital.</p>

<p>I looked up this definition on <strong><a href=""http://www.mathwords.com/m/multiplicity.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">Mathwords.com</a></strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How many times a particular number is a zero for a given polynomial. For example, in the polynomial function $f(x) = (x – 3)^4(x – 5)(x – 8)^2$, the zero 3 has multiplicity 4, 5 has multiplicity 1, and 8 has multiplicity 2. Although this polynomial has only three zeros, we say that it has <strong>seven zeros</strong> counting multiplicity. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is a 'zero of multiplicity' and where do the ""seven zeros"" come from (I know the ""7"" comes from adding the three exponents, ""4"", the hidden ""1"", and ""2"" in the equation, but why call them <em>zeroes</em>?)? </p>

<p>As in, I don't understand where the zero part of the term comes in...<br>
<sub>(bold emphasis mine).</sub></p>
","<p>A ""zero"" of a polynomial is a value of $x$ at which the polynomial, when evaluated, is equal to zero.</p>

<p>The compound phrase ""of multiplicity $k$"" (where $k$ is a positive integer) modifies ""zero"" (e.g., ""zero of multiplicity 3"", ""multiplicity 3"" and not just 'multiplicity' is modifying ""zero""); what it means is that the zero is actually a solution ""multiple times"".</p>

<p>It is a theorem (called the <strong>Factor Theorem</strong>) that if $a$ is a zero of the polynomial $p(x)$, then you can write the polynomial $p(x)$ as $p(x)=(x-a)q(x)$; that is, a product. Any zero of $q$ is also a zero of $p(x)$. </p>

<p>We say that $a$ is a zero ""of multiplicity $k$"" of $p(x)$ if you can write $p(x)$ as $p(x)=(x-a)^kq(x)$, but not as $p(x)=(x-a)^{k+1}q(x)$.</p>

<p>For example, take $p(x)=x^2-2x+1$. Then $x=1$ is a zero of $p(x)$; in fact, since $p(x) = (x-1)^2$, $1$ is a zero ""of multiplicity $2$"". </p>

<p>Similarly, $p(x)=x^4 - 9x^3 + 30x^2 - 44x + 24$ has $x=3$ and $x=2$ as zeros (plug them in, you get zero: $p(3) = 81 - 243 + 270 - 132 + 24 = 0$, $p(2) = 16 - 72 + 120 - 88 + 24 = 0$). In fact, $p(x) = (x-2)^3(x-3)$, so $3$ is a zero ""once"" and $2$ is a zero ""three times"", so $2$ is a zero ""of multiplicity three"" and 3 is a zero ""of multiplicity one"".</p>

"Probability density function vs. probability mass function","84904","","<p>I've a confession to make. I've been using pdf's and pmf's without actually knowing what they are. The idea that I've been having so long is that density = area under the curve but if I look at it that way then a lot of times it didn't make sense when we refer to the mass of a random variable in discrete distributions. How can I interpret this? Why do we call mass or density instead of something else?</p>

<p>P.S. Please feel free to change the question itself in a more understandable way if you feel this is a logically wrong question.</p>
","<p>(This answer takes as its starting point the OP's question in the comments, ""Let me understand mass before going to density. Why do we call a point in the discrete distribution as mass? Why can't we just call it a point?"")</p>

<p>We could certainly call it a point.  The utility of the term ""probability mass function,"" though, is that it tells us something about how the function in the discrete setting relates to the function in the continuous setting because of the associations we already have with ""mass"" and ""density.""  And I think to understand why we use these terms in the first place we have to start with what we call the density function.  (In fact, I'm not sure we would even be using ""probability mass"" without the corresponding ""probability density"" function.)</p>

<p>Let's say we have some function $f(x)$ that we haven't named yet but we know that $\int_a^b f(x) dx$ yields the probability that we see an outcome between $a$ and $b$.  What should we call $f(x)$?  Well, what are its properties?  Let's start with its units.  We know that, in general, the units on a definite integral $\int_a^b f(x) dx$ are the units of $f(x)$ times the units of $dx$.  In our setting, the integral gives a probability, and $dx$ has units in say, length.  So the units of $f(x)$ must be probability per unit length.  This means that $f(x)$ must be telling us something about how much probability is concentrated per unit length near $x$; i.e., how <em>dense</em> the probability is near $x$.  So it makes sense to call $f(x)$ a ""probability density function.""  (In fact, one way to view $\int_a^b f(x) dx$ is that, if $f(x) \geq 0$, $f(x)$ is <em>always</em> a density function.  From this point of view, height is area density, area is volume density, speed is distance density, etc.  One of my colleagues uses an approach like this when he discusses applications of integration in second-semester calculus.)</p>

<p>Now that we've named $f(x)$ a density function, what should we call the corresponding function in the discrete setting?  It's not a density function; its units are probability rather than probability per unit length.  So what is it?  Well, when we say ""density"" without a qualifier we are normally talking about ""mass density,"" and when we integrate a density function over an object we obtain the mass of that object.  With this in mind, the relationship between the probability function in the continuous setting to that of the probability function in the discrete setting is exactly that of density to mass.  So ""probability mass function"" is a natural term to grab to apply to the corresponding discrete function.  </p>

"How does knowing a function as even or odd help in integration ??","84300","","<p>So, I am learning <code>Fourier Series</code> and it involves integration. I am not too good at integration.<br>
Now, the resource I use is <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/course?list=EC1B727B06A221E026"">videos by Dr. Chris Tisdell</a>. In the opening video he says that knowing whether the function as even or odd will greatly simplify the integration process.  </p>

<p>So, I have two questions:<br>
1. What is even/odd function?<br>
2. How will that simplify integration ?</p>
","<h2>Odd and even functions</h2>

<p>Even and odd are terms used to describe particularly well-behaved functions.</p>

<p>An <em>even</em> function is symmetric about the $y$-axis. That is, if we reflect the graph of the function in the $y$-axis, then it doesn’t change. Formally, we say that $\,f$ is even if, for all $x$ and $-x$ in the domain of $\,f$, we have
$$f(-x)=f(x)$$
Examples of even functions are $\,f(x)=x^2$ and $\,f(x)=\cos x$.</p>

<p>An <em>odd</em> function has rotational symmetry of order two about the origin. That is, if we rotate the graph of the function $180^\circ$ about the origin, then it doesn’t change. Formally, we say that $\,f$ is odd if, for all $x$ and $-x$ in the domain of $\,f$, we have
$$f(-x)=-f(x)$$
Examples of odd functions are $\,f(x)=x^3$ and $\,f(x)=\sin x$.</p>

<h2>Integration</h2>

<p>When calculating Fourier series, you often consider integrals of the form
$$I=\int_{-a}^a f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x$$
If $\,f$ is odd or even, then sometimes you can make this simpler. We can rewrite that integral in the following way:
\begin{align*}
I=\int_{-a}^a f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x
&amp;= \int_{-a}^0 f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x + \int_0^a f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x \\
&amp;= \int_0^a f(-x)\,\mathrm{d}x + \int_0^a f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x
\end{align*}
For an even function, we have $f(-x)=f(x)$, whence
$$I = 2\int_0^a f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x$$
For an odd function, we have $f(-x)=-f(x)$, whence
$$I = \int_0^a (-f(x)+f(x))\,\mathrm{d}x = 0$$
That’s what it means to simplify the integration: the integral of an odd or even function over the interval $[-a,a]$ can be put into a nicer form (and sometimes we can see that it vanishes without ever computing an integral).</p>

"""Where"" exactly are complex numbers used ""in the real world""?","84265","","<p>I've always enjoyed solving problems in the complex numbers during my undergrad. However, I've always wondered where are they used and for what? In my domain (computer science) I've rarely seen it be used/applied and hence am curious.</p>

<p>So what practical applications of complex numbers exist and what are the ways in which complex  transformation helps address the problem that wasn't immediately addressable?</p>

<p>Way back in undergrad when I asked my professor this he mentioned that ""the folks in mechanical and aerospace engineering use it a lot"" but for what? (Don't other domains use it too?). I'm well aware of its use in Fourier analysis but that's the farthest I got to a 'real world application'. I'm sure that's not <em>it.</em></p>

<p>PS: I'm not looking for the ability to make one problem easier to solve, but a bigger picture where the result of the complex analysis is used for something meaningful in the real world. A naive analogy is deciding the height of tower based on trigonometry. That's going from paper to the real world. Similarly, what is it that is analyzed in the complex world and the result is used in the real world without imaginaries clouding the problem?</p>

<p>The question: <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/q/4961/19344"">Interesting results easily achieved using complex numbers</a> is nice but covers a more mathematical perspective on interim results that make solving a problem easier. It covers different ground IMHO.</p>

"Odds of Winning the Lottery Using the Same Numbers Repeatedly Better/Worse?","84052","","<p>Does the probability of winning the lottery differ between randomly generated numbers vs. selecting the same numbers every time?</p>

<p>Specifically. I'm interested in a breakdown of the odds per number for a given set of numbers that comprise a single US Powerball drawing (five white numbers plus the one powerball number), and how they arrive at the odds seen here: <a href=""http://www.powerball.com/powerball/pb_prizes.asp"">http://www.powerball.com/powerball/pb_prizes.asp</a></p>

<p>Tying that back to my original question, I was interested if playing the same numbers every drawing changes those odds.</p>
","<p>So here is how <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerball"">Powerball</a> works.  You choose five different numbers between $1$ and $59$ inclusive (the white balls) and one number between $1$ and $39$ inclusive (the red ball).  If the white balls match the winning numbers for the white balls, in <em>any order</em>, and if the red ball matches the winning number for the red ball, then you win the jackpot.  </p>

<p>Because you can match the white balls in any order, the Powerball winning numbers are usually presented from smallest to largest, so if you order your numbers from smallest to largest, the two sequences have to match.  The number of ways to pick five different numbers in <em>any</em> order from $1$ to $59$ is </p>

<p>$$\frac{59 \cdot 58 \cdot 57 \cdot 56 \cdot 55}{5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = 5006386$$</p>

<p>and every choice of five different numbers in increasing order has the same probability (one over the above number) of being chosen.  One way to get the above number is as follows: first, pretend that order matters.  Then there are $59$ possibilities for the first number.  Since there are $58$ possibilities left, there are $58$ possibilities for the second number.  And so forth.  But since order doesn't matter, you can draw any set of five numbers in $5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1$ different ways (five <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial"">factorial</a>), so you have to divide by that.</p>

<p>Matching the red ball is easy: there are $39$ choices, so you have a $\frac{1}{39}$ chance of doing it.  So, in summary, your odds of winning the jackpot from <em>any</em> choice of numbers is</p>

<p>$$\frac{1}{5006386 \cdot 39} = \frac{1}{195249054}$$</p>

<p>just as reported on the Powerball website.  In other words, it's one over the total number of possible tickets.  (The other probabilities reported on the website are slightly harder to calculate, but not by much; for that you need to learn about something called the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusion%E2%80%93exclusion_principle"">inclusion-exclusion principle</a>.)</p>

The number of ways of distributing $n$ identical objects among $r$ groups such that each group can have $0$ or more $(\le n)$ objects</p>

<p>I know that standard way of doing this is to solve the problem of distributing n identical objects and $(r-1)$ partitions among themselves which can be done in $C(n+r-1,r-1)$ ways. </p>

<p>But I am unable to prove to myself why it is not $(r+1)^n$. 
Because each of the n objects has r+1 choices, either group1, group2,... group r or none at all. </p>
","<p>The post quotes the standard expression for the number of ways of distributing $n$ identical objects among $r$ groups.  The wording used seems to indicate that you are aware of the counting argument that leads to this expression. In case I am wrong about that, please look at the Wikipedia <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stars_and_bars_%28combinatorics%29"">Stars and Bars</a> article.</p>

<p>What is  meant by ""prove to myself <strong>why</strong> it is not $(r+1)^n$?"" I will write about this question for a while, and towards the end describe reasoning that <em>might</em> be connected with your $(r+1)^n$.</p>

<p>Let us first look at a simpler question, proving <strong>that</strong> it is not $(r+1)^n$. If you can find even a <strong>single</strong> pair $(r, n)$ of integers for which the expression $(r+1)^n$ gives the wrong answer, you will know that $(r+1)^n$ is not (always) correct.</p>

<p>To do this, just follow the excellent suggestion of Gerry Myerson.  Look at a small example, like $r=2$, $n=2$.  In how many ways can you distribute $2$ identical jelly beans between two people, $A$ and $B$?  Maybe $A$ gets both of them. Maybe $B$ does. Maybe $A$ gets one and $B$ gets one. That's all, the total number of ways is $3$.  </p>

<p>If the expression $(r+1)^n$ was correct for $r=2$, $n=2$, the number of ways would be $3^2$, which is clearly not equal to the correct answer $3$ that we are absolutely sure of. (We are absolutely sure because the count is so simple, so direct, that we could not possibly have made a mistake.)  By the way, if you check, you will find that the expression $C(n+r-1,r-1)$ gives the right answer, for $C(3,1)=3$.</p>

<p>When you are trying to solve a combinatorial problem, it is important to experiment, to try to look at small cases where you can do the count ""by hand."" Unless the problem is very standard, that is the right way to start.  And any concrete counting that you do can later serve as a check.</p>

<p>So we know <strong>that</strong> $(r+1)^n$, at least sometimes, gives the wrong answer.  (Actually, it usually gives  an answer that is <em>much larger</em> than the truth.) </p>

<p>Next let us try to deal with <strong>why</strong> $(r+1)^n$ gives the wrong answer.  Is there any good reason to think that it should give the right answer?  You think there might be.  Let's look for a problem for which $(r+1)^n$ is the right answer.</p>

<p>I have $n$ <strong>distinct</strong> gifts to give out, to $r$ people, except that I may choose to not give out some of the gifts, and keep them for myself.  For any gift, I have $r+1$ choices of what to do with it.  Then there are $(r+1)^n$ ways to do the gift-giving. It is crucial here that the gifts be distinct. </p>

<p>I cannot see any direct connection between this gift giving and the problem of distributing $n$ <strong>identical</strong> objects among $r$ people.</p>

<p>If the gifts are distinct, and I cannot keep any of them, there are $r^n$ ways to do the distribution.  One might think that then one could adjust this for the fact that the gifts are all identical.  That kind of adjustment can be made when you count the number of $6$-letter  ""words"" you can make using all the letters of CANADA.  You first imagine the A's to be distinct, getting $6!$, and then divide by $3!$ to deal with the fact that the A's are not distinct. But such a strategy will not work for our distributing identical objects problem. It would grossly over count.</p>

<p>Any strategy for counting by thinking of giving out the objects one at a time quickly runs into trouble.  It usually greatly overcounts the number of ways.  For example, in how many ways can we distribute $n$ jelly beans among $2$ people, $A$ and $B$?  Person $A$ can get $0$, or $1$, or $2$, and so on up to $n$, a total of $n+1$ possibilities.  That's probably where your intuition about the $+{}1$ came from, though you applied it to $r$, not to $n$.  </p>

<p>What about $n$ jelly beans and $3$ people? You might think there are $n+1$ ways to decide how many $A$ gets, and then $n+1$ ways to decide how many $B$ gets, with $C$ getting the rest.  That argument would give a count of $(n+1)^2$.  But that count would be <strong>incorrect</strong>.  If you have $3$ people, and $8$ jelly beans, and have given $6$ to $A$, you can't then give $5$ to $B$.  So although there are $n+1$ choices for how many to give to $A$, it is not true that for every one of these choices there are $n+1$ ways to decide how many to give to $B$.</p>

","<p>For a plane in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with $\mathbf{r_0}$ a point that lies in the plane and $\mathbf{n}$ a vector normal to the plane, its equation can be given by:
 $$
  \mathbf{n}\cdot(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r_0})=0 \quad \mbox{where} \quad \mathbf{r}=(x,y,z)
 $$</p>

<p>To solve your question, let us first rearrange the above equation:
$$
   \mathbf{n}\cdot(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r_0})=0 \quad\Rightarrow\quad  \mathbf{n}\cdot\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{n}\cdot\mathbf{r_0}=0 \quad\Rightarrow\quad \mathbf{n}\cdot\mathbf{r}=\mathbf{n}\cdot\mathbf{r_0}
$$</p>

<p>Substituting values, gives the following equation for the plane in Cartesian form:
$$
(1,7,-2)\cdot(x,y,z) = (1,7,-2)\cdot(3,1,6) \quad \Rightarrow \quad

","<p>There is no perfect answer to this question. For polynomials up to degree 4, there are explicit solution formulas similar to that for the quadratic equation (the Cardano formulas for third-degree equations, see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardano_formula#Cardano.27s_method"">here</a>, and the Ferrari formula for degree 4, see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartic_function#The_general_case.2C_along_Ferrari.27s_lines"">here</a>). </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Sumerians watched the Sun, Moon, and the five visible planets
  (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn), primarily for omens. They
  did not try to understand the motions physically. They did, however,
  notice the circular track of the Sun's annual path across the sky and
  knew that <strong>it took about 360 days to complete one year's circuit</strong>.
  Consequently, they divided the <strong>circular path into 360 degrees</strong> to track
  each day's passage of the Sun's whole journey. This <em>probably happened
  about 2400 BC</em>.</p>
  
  <p>That's how we got a 360 degree circle. Around 1500 BC, Egyptians
  divided the day into 24 hours, though the hours varied with the
  seasons originally. Greek astronomers made the hours equal. About 300
  to 100 BC, the <strong>Babylonians subdivided the hour into base-60 fractions:
  60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute</strong>. The base 60 of their
  number system lives on in our time and angle divisions.</p>
  
  <p>An 100-degree circle makes sense for base 10 people like ourselves.
  But the base-60 Babylonians came up with 360 degrees and we cling to
  their ways-4,400 years later.</p>

<p>Then, there's also this discussion <a href=""http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/59075.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">on Math Forum</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 1936, a tablet was excavated some 200 miles from Babylon. Here one
  should make the interjection that the Sumerians were first to make one
  of man's greatest inventions, namely, writing; through written
  communication, knowledge could be passed from one person to others,
  and from one generation to the next and future ones.  They impressed
  their cuneiform (wedge-shaped) script on soft clay tablets with a
  stylus, and the tablets were then hardened in the sun.  The mentioned
  tablet, whose translation was partially published only in 1950, is
  devoted to various geometrical figures, and states that the ratio of
  the perimeter of a regular hexagon to the circumference of the
  circumscribed circle equals a number which in modern notation is given
  by $ \frac{57}{60} + \frac{36}{60^2} $
  (the Babylonians used the sexagesimal system, i.e., their
  base was 60 rather than 10).</p>
  
  <p>The Babylonians knew, of course, that the perimeter of a hexagon is
  exactly equal to six times the radius of the circumscribed circle, in
  fact that was evidently the reason why they chose to divide the circle
  into 360 degrees (and we are still burdened with that figure to this
  day).  The tablet, therefore, gives ... $\pi = \frac{25}{8} = 3.125$.</p>

<p>Does this question have a correct answer?</p>
","<p>No, it is not meaningful. 25% is correct iff 50% is correct, and 50% is correct iff 25% is correct, so it can be neither of those two (because if <em>both</em> are correct, the only correct answer could be 75% which is not even an option). But it cannot be 0% either, because then the correct answer would be 25%. So none of the answers are correct, so the answer must be 0%. But then it is 25%. And so forth.</p>

<p>It's a multiple-choice variant (with bells and whistles) of the classical <em>liar paradox</em>, which asks whether the statement</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This statement is false.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>is true or false. There are various more or less contrived ""philosophical"" attempts to resolve it, but by far the most common resolution is to deny that the statement means anything in the first place; therefore it is also meaningless to ask for its truth value.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edited much later to add:</strong> There's a variant of this puzzle that's very popular on the internet at the moment, in which answer option (c) is 60% rather than 0%. In this variant it is at least internally consistent to claim that all of the answers are wrong, and so the possibility of getting a right one by choosing randomly is 0%.</p>

<p>Whether this actually resolves the variant puzzle is more a matter of taste and temperament than an objective mathematical question. It is not in general true for self-referencing questions that simply being internally consistent is enough for an answer to be unambiguously right; otherwise the question</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is the correct answer to this question ""yes""?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>would have two different ""right"" answers, because ""yes"" and ""no"" are both internally consistent. In the 60% variant of the puzzle it is happens that the <em>only</em> internally consistent answer is ""0%"", but even so one might, as a matter of caution, still deny that such reasoning by elimination is valid for self-referential statements at all. If one adopts this stance, one would still consider the 60% variant meaningless.</p>

<p>One rationale for taking this strict position would be that we don't want to accept reasoning by elimination on</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>True or false?</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>The Great Pumpkin exists.</li>
  <li>Both of these statements are false.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>where the only internally consistent resolution is that the first statement is true and the second one is false. However, it appears to be unsound to conclude that the Great Pumpkin exists on the basis simply that the puzzle was posed.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is difficult to argue that there is <em>no</em> possible principle that will cordon off the Great Pumpkin example as meaningless while still allowing the 60% variant to be meaningful.</p>

<p>In the end, though, these things are more matters of taste and philosophy than they are mathematics. <em>In mathematics</em> we generally prefer to play it safe and completely refuse to work with explicitly self-referential statements. This avoids the risk of paradox, and does not seem to hinder mathematical arguments about the things mathematicians are ordinarily interested in. So whatever one decides to do with the question-about-itself, what one does is not really mathematics.</p>

What distinguishes predicate logic from propositional logic?</p>
","<p>Propositional logic (also called sentential logic) is logic that includes sentence letters (A,B,C) and logical connectives, but not quantifiers. The semantics of propositional logic uses truth assignments to the letters to determine whether a compound propositional sentence is true. </p>

<p>Predicate logic is usually used as a synonym for first-order logic, but sometimes it is used to refer to other logics that have similar syntax. Syntactically, first-order logic has the same connectives as propositional logic, but it also has variables for individual objects, quantifiers, symbols for functions, and symbols for relations. The semantics include a domain of discourse for the variables and quantifiers to range over, along with interpretations of the relation and function symbols.</p>

<p>Many undergrad logic books will present both propositional and predicate logic, so if you find one it will have much more info. A couple of well-regarded options that focus directly on this sort of thing are Mendelson's book or Enderton's book. </p>

<p>Eigenvalue and eigenvector is easy to calculate and the concept is not difficult to understand.I found that there are many application of eigenvalue and eigenvector in multivariate analysis. For example</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In principal components, proportion of total population variance due
  to kth principal component equal 
  $$\frac{\lambda_k}{\lambda_1+\lambda_2+...\lambda_k}$$</p>

<p>I think eigenvalue product corresponding eigenvector has same effect as the matrix product eigenvector geometrically. </p>

<p>I think my former understanding may be too naive so that I cannot find the link between eigenvalue and its application in principal components and others. </p>

<p>I know how to induce almost every step form the assumption to the result mathematically. I'd like to know how to <strong><em>intuitively</em></strong> or <strong><em>geometrically</em></strong> understand eigenvalue and eigenvector in the context of <strong>multivariate analysis</strong>(in linear algebra is also good).</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
","<p>Personally, I feel that intuition isn't something which is easily explained. Intuition in mathematics is synonymous with experience and you gain intuition by working numerous examples. With my disclaimer out of the way, let me try to present a very informal way of looking at eigenvalues and eigenvectors.</p>

<p>First, let us forget about principal component analysis for a little bit and ask ourselves exactly what eigenvectors and eigenvalues are. A typical introduction to spectral theory presents eigenvectors as vectors which are fixed in direction under a given linear transformation. The scaling factor of these eigenvectors is then called the eigenvalue. Under such a definition, I imagine that many students regard this as a minor curiosity, convince themselves that it must be a useful concept and then move on. It is not immediately clear, at least to me, why this should serve as such a central subject in linear algebra.</p>

<p>Eigenpairs are a lot like the roots of a polynomial. It is difficult to describe why the concept of a root is useful, not because there are few applications but because there are too many. If you tell me all the roots of a polynomial, then mentally I have an image of how the polynomial must look. For example, all monic cubics with three real roots look more or less the same. So one of the most central facts about the roots of a polynomial is that they <em>ground</em> the polynomial. A root literally <em>roots</em> the polynomial, limiting it's shape.</p>

<p>Eigenvectors are much the same. If you have a line or plane which is invariant then there is only so much you can do to the surrounding space without breaking the limitations. So in a sense eigenvectors are not important because they themselves are fixed but rather they limit the behavior of the linear transformation. Each eigenvector is like a skewer which helps to hold the linear transformation into place.</p>

<p>Very (very, very) roughly then, the eigenvalues of a linear mapping is a measure of the distortion induced by the transformation and the eigenvectors tell you about how the distortion is oriented. It is precisely this rough picture which makes PCA very useful. </p>

<p>Suppose you have a set of data which is distributed as an ellipsoid oriented in $3$-space. If this ellipsoid was very flat in some direction, then in a sense we can recover much of the information that we want even if we ignore the thickness of the ellipse. This what PCA aims to do. The eigenvectors tell you about how the ellipse is oriented and the eigenvalues tell you where the ellipse is distorted (where it's flat). If you choose to ignore the ""thickness"" of the ellipse then you are effectively compressing the eigenvector in that direction; you are projecting the ellipsoid into the most optimal direction to look at.

"Probability of winning a prize in a raffle","78959","","<p>My work is having it's annual Christmas raffle today. 1600 tickets have been sold, and there are 40 prizes to win. I have bought ten tickets. What are the odds I will win a prize?</p>

<p>While an initial estimate of 1/160 is probably within a close enough range to suggest I have little chance of winning, I am curious as to what the precise odds would be. Tickets are not put back in once they have been drawn.</p>
","<p>You'll be surprised. The correct probability of winning at least one ticket is around $0.2242$. </p>

<p>Assuming exactly one prize is given, your answer of $\frac{1}{160}$ is the probability of winning is correct. That is, you go home empty-handed with probability $\frac{159}{160}$. However, $40$ tickets are chosen for prizes, not just one. So even if you miss out on a prize the first time, you could still end up with the second winning ticket; or the third; or the $40^{th}$. What we need to calculate is the chance of winning <strong>at least one</strong> of those tickets. </p>

<hr>

<p><em>For the moment, assume that the prizes are drawn with replacement.</em> Then in order for you to <strong>not</strong> get a prize, you need to miss the first time, <strong>and</strong> the second time, <strong>and</strong> the third time, and so on, until the $40^{th}$ time. Under our assumption that these are drawn with replacement, all these $40$ events are <strong>independent</strong>. Therefore, the probability that you miss out on a prize is simply the probability that miss out in any given trial, raised to the power of $40$; i.e., 
$$
\left(\frac{159}{160} \right)^{40} \approx 0.7782.
$$
Hence, the chance that you win a prize is $1 - 0.7782 \approx 0.2218$.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>When the prizes are drawn without replacement.</em> Now we are going to compute the exact answer without any assumptions. There are $1600$ tickets, out of which you bought the first ten (say). The judges pick $40$ winners out of the $1600$ tickets; this can be done in $\binom{1600}{40}$ ways. [See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient"">binomial coefficients</a> in Wikipedia.] Of these, you will not win a prize if those $40$ tickets are drawn from the $1590$ tickets that you did not buy. That is, there are $\binom{1590}{40}$ possible outcomes in which you will go home empty-handed. That is, you go home empty-handed with probability 
$$
\frac{\binom{1590}{40}}{\binom{1600}{40}}.
$$
Therefore, you will win a prize with the complementary probability
$$
1 - \frac{\binom{1590}{40}}{\binom{1600}{40}} = \frac{1420730930795547} {6335978517846620} \approx 0.2242.
$$
As you can see, that the approximate answer is quite close to the exact one.</p>

"Finding the Derivative of |x| using the Limit Definition","78136","","<p>Please Help me derive the derivative of the absolute value of x using the following limit definition.
$$\lim_{\Delta x\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x}
$$
I have no idea as to how to get started.Please Help.</p>

<p>Thank You</p>
","<p>Since the absolute value is defined by cases,
$$|x|=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
x &amp; \text{if }x\geq 0;\\
-x &amp; \text{if }x\lt 0,
\end{array}\right.$$
it makes sense to deal separately with the cases of $x\gt 0$, $x\lt 0$, and $x=0$.</p>

<p>For $x\gt0$, for $\Delta x$ sufficiently close to $0$ we will have $x+\Delta x\gt 0$. So
$f(x)= |x| = x$, and $f(x+\Delta x) = |x+\Delta x| = x+\Delta x$; plugging that into the limit, we have:
$$\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\frac{f(x+\Delta x) - f(x)}{\Delta x} = \lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\frac{|x+\Delta x|-|x|}{\Delta x} = \lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\frac{(x+\Delta x)-x}{\Delta x}.$$
You should be able to finish it now.</p>

<p>For $x\lt 0$, for $\Delta x$ sufficiently close to zero we will have $x+\Delta x\lt 0$; so $f(x) = -x$ and $f(x+\Delta x) = -(x+\Delta x)$. It should again be easy to finish it.</p>

<p>The tricky one is $x=0$. I suggest using one-sided limits. For the limit as $\Delta x\to 0^+$, $x+\Delta x = \Delta x\gt 0$; for $\Delta x \to 0^-$, $x+\Delta x = \Delta x\lt 0$; the (one-sided) limits should now be straightforward.</p>

whereas on the other hand
$$E(X^2) = 0.5 \times 0^2 + 0.5 \times 1^2 = 0.5.$$
By the way, since $Var(X) = E[(X - \mu)^2] = \sum_x (x - \mu)^2 P(x)$, the only way the variance could ever be 0 in the discrete case is when $X$ is constant.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Conducting an internship at the Chair of Fluid Mechanics at TU
  Dresden, Shouryya Ray encountered two ordinary differential equations
  which are special cases of Newton's law that the derivative of the
  momentum of a particle equals the forces acting on it. In the first
  one, which describes the motion of a particle in a gas or fluid, this
  force is the sum of a damping force, which depends quadratically on
  the velocity, and the (constant) gravitational force.
  $$\begin{eqnarray*} \dot{u} &amp;=&amp;-u\sqrt{u^{2}+v^{2}},\qquad
u(0)=u_{0}&gt;0 \\ \dot{v} &amp;=&amp;-v\sqrt{u^{2}+v^{2}}-g,\quad v(0)=v_{0}.
\end{eqnarray*}\tag{1}$$ Here, $u$ and $v$ are the horizontal and
  vertical velocity, respectively.</p>
  
  <p>(...)</p>
  
  <p>The second equation reads $$ \ddot{z}=-\dot{z}-z^{3/2},\qquad
z(0)=0,\dot{z}(0)=z_{1},\tag{2} $$ and describes the trajectory of the
  center point $z(t)$ of a spherical particle during a normal collision
  with a plane wall.
  (...)    </p>
  
  <p>Let us come back to problem (1) which was the starting point of the media stories. In the context of Shouryya Ray's work it was an unfortunate circumstance, that a recent article from 2007$^8$ claims that no analytical solution of problem (1) was known, or that it was known only in special cases, namely falling objects$^9$. This might have misled Shouryya Ray who was not aware of the classical theory of ordinary differential equations.
  (...)</p>
  
  <p>To conclude, Shouryya Ray has obtained analytic solutions of the problem (1), by transforming it successively to the problems (3)-(5), and by applying a recent result of D. Dominici in order to obtain a recursive formula for the coefficients of the power series representation of $\psi$. He then validated his results numerically. Given the level of prerequisites that he had, he made great progress. Nevertheless all his steps are basically known to experts and we emphasize that he did not solve an open problem posed by Newton.
  (...)</p>
  
  <p>We hope that this small text gives the necessary information to the mathematical community, and that it allows the community to both put in context and appreciate the work of Shouryya Ray who plans to start a career in mathematics and physics.</p>

<p>The function $\psi$ is given by</p>

<p>$$\psi (t)=(v_{0}-g\Psi (t))/u_{0},$$</p>

"Image and kernel of a matrix transformation","76804","","<p>I had a couple of questions about a matrix problem. What I'm given is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Consider a linear transformation $T: \mathbb R^5 \to \mathbb R^4$ defined by $T( \vec{x} )=A\vec{x}$, where
  $$A = \left(\begin{array}{crc}
 1 &amp;  2 &amp;  2 &amp; -5 &amp;  6\\

</blockquote>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<p>What do they mean by the <strong>transformation</strong>?</p>

<p>What do I use to actually find the <strong>image</strong> and <strong>kernel</strong>, and how do I do that?</p>
","<p>After a long night of studying I finally figured out the answer to these. The previous answers on transformation were all good, but I have the outlined steps on how to find $\mathrm{im}(T)$ and $\ker(T)$.</p>

<p>$$A = \left(\begin{array}{crc}
 1 &amp;  2 &amp;  2 &amp; -5 &amp;  6\\
-1 &amp; -2 &amp; -1 &amp;  1 &amp; -1\\
 4 &amp;  8 &amp;  5 &amp; -8 &amp;  9\\
 3 &amp;  6 &amp;  1 &amp;  5 &amp; -7
\end{array}\right)$$</p>

<p>(1) Find $\mathrm{im}(T)$</p>

<p>$\mathrm{im}(T)$ is the same thing as column space or $C(A)$. The first step to getting that is to take the Transpose of $A$.</p>

<p>$$ 
A^T = \left(\begin{array}{crc}
 1 &amp; -1 &amp;  4 &amp;  3 \\
 2 &amp; -2 &amp;  8 &amp;  6 \\
 2 &amp; -1 &amp;  5 &amp;  1 \\
-5 &amp;  1 &amp; -8 &amp;  5 \\
 6 &amp; -1 &amp;  9 &amp;  -7 
\end{array}\right)$$</p>

<p>once that's done the next step is to reduce $A^T$ to Reduced Row Echelon Form</p>

<p>$$ 
\mathrm{rref}(A^T) = \left(\begin{array}{crc}
 1 &amp; 0 &amp;  1 &amp; -2 \\
 0 &amp; 1 &amp; -3 &amp; -5 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp;  0 &amp;  0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp;  0 &amp;  0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp;  0 &amp;  0 
\end{array}\right)$$</p>

<p>now on this step I honestly don't know the reasons behind it, but the thext thing you do is take the rows and that's your answer. so that: </p>

<p>$$\mathrm{im}(T)\ = \begin{align*}
\operatorname{span}\Bigg\{\left(\begin{array}{crc}
 1 \\
 0 \\
 1 \\
-2 \end{array}\right), \left(\begin{array}{crc}
 0 \\
 1 \\
 -3 \\
-5 \end{array}\right)\Bigg\}
\end{align*}$$</p>

<p>(2) Find $\ker(T)$</p>

<p>$ker(T)$ ends up being the same as the null space of matrix, and we find it by first taking the Reduced Row Echelon Form of A</p>

<p>$$ 
\mathrm{rref}(A) = \left(\begin{array}{crc}
 1 &amp; 2 &amp;  0 &amp;  3 &amp; -4\\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp;  1 &amp; -4 &amp;  5\\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp;  0 &amp;  0 &amp;  0\\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp;  0 &amp;  0 &amp;  0
\end{array}\right)$$</p>

<p>we then use that to solve for the values of $\mathbb R^5$ so that we get</p>

<p>$$\begin{align*}
\left(\begin{array}{crc}
 x_1 \\
 x_2 \\
 x_3 \\
 x_4 \\
 x_5 \end{array}\right) = r\left(\begin{array}{crc}
 -2 \\
  1 \\
  0 \\

  0 \end{array}\right) + s\left(\begin{array}{crc}

 1 \\
 0 \end{array}\right) + t\left(\begin{array}{crc}
 4 \\
 0 \\
-5 \\
 0 \\
 1 \end{array}\right)
\end{align*}$$</p>

<p>from that we arrange the vectors and get our answer the vectors and that gives us our answer </p>

<p>$$\begin{align*}
ker(T) = span\Bigg\{\left(\begin{array}{crc}
 1 \\
 0 \\
 0 \\
-2 \\
 0 \end{array}\right), \left(\begin{array}{crc}

<p>I know how you find out the Area of a Sector and the Arc Length but I'm not sure how to find out the radius of a circle?</p>

<p>I understand that there are formulas but I find them quite confusing...</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>Using the formula $$L=2\pi r\times\frac{\theta}{360}$$ where $L$ is arc length, you can rearrange to give:
$$r=\frac{L}{2\pi} \times \frac{360}{\theta}$$
You know that $L=15$ and that $\theta = 27$, so put these values into the formula to obtain:
$$r=\frac{15}{2\pi}\times\frac{360}{27}=31.83cm$$
If you find this formula confusing I would think about it like this. The circumference of a whole circle is $\pi d = 2\pi r$. To find the arc length, we need to its percentage of the total circumference of the circle. This percentage is the angle in the middle of the sector divided by the angle of a whole circle ($\frac{\theta}{360}$). Hence to find the arc length, you find the circumference and then multiply this by the percentage of that circumference which we need to find. This is where the first formula comes from.</p>

I don't understand the general formula given below.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rfd1o.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>Let us assume one wants to <em>evade</em> Venn diagrams, then <strong>indicator functions</strong> are an alternative. </p>

<p>Recall that for every set $A$ and every element $x$, $\mathbf 1_A(x)$ is $1$ if $x\in A$ and $0$ if $x\notin A$. Then, for every subset $A$ of a given set $E$, this defines a function $\mathbf 1_A:E\to\mathbb R$, called the indicator function of $A$ (in $E$), such that
$$
|A|=\sum\limits_{x\in E}\mathrm 1_A(x).\tag{1}
$$
This formulation might seem to only complicate things. Let us show the opposite is true, for the reason that now one deals with sums on a fixed set $E$.</p>

<p>It happens that indicator functions are especially well suited to <strong>intersections</strong>. To wit, for every collection of sets $A_k$ with intersection $C$,
$$
\mathbf 1_C=\prod\limits_k\mathbf 1_{A_k}.
$$
Let us now put <strong>indicator functions</strong> and <strong>intersections of sets</strong> together. </p>

<p>First consider two sets $A$ and $B$. Then one might remember that $\mathbf 1_{A\cup B}=\mathbf 1_A+\mathbf 1_B-\mathbf 1_{A\cap B}$ and proceed. So far so good, except this is not a new formula at all. To see this, consider that unions of complementary sets are complementary sets of intersections so let us find the intersection hidden here. One gets
$$
E\setminus(A\cup B)=(E\setminus A)\cap(E\setminus B),
$$
hence
$$
\mathbf 1_{E\setminus(A\cup B)}=\mathbf 1_{E\setminus A}\cdot\mathbf 1_{E\setminus B}.\tag{2}
$$
One last tool before we proceed. To enumerate a complementary set is easy, since
$$
\mathbf 1_{E\setminus A}=1-\mathbf 1_A.\tag{3}
$$
Note that, using (1), (3) yields
$$
|E\setminus A|=\sum\limits_{x\in E}(1-\mathrm 1_A(x))=\sum\limits_{x\in E}1-\sum\limits_{x\in E}\mathrm 1_A(x)=|E|-|A|.
$$
Coming back to the union, (2) and (3) yield
$$
1-\mathbf 1_{A\cup B}=(1-\mathbf 1_{A})\cdot(1-\mathbf 1_{B})=1-\mathbf 1_A-\mathbf 1_B+\mathbf 1_{A\cap B},
$$
which can be rewritten as
$$
\mathbf 1_{A\cup B}=\mathbf 1_A+\mathbf 1_B-\mathbf 1_{A\cap B}.
$$
For two sets, <em>this</em> was complicating well known arguments for nothing but now, let us consider $n$ subsets $A_k$ of $E$ and let us  try to imitate the arguments above. </p>

<p>Calling $A$ the union of the sets $A_k$, $B_k=E\setminus A_k$ and $B$ the intersection of the sets $B_k$, one gets 
$$
E\setminus A=B,\quad
\mathbf 1_B=\prod\limits_{k=1}^n\mathbf 1_{B_k},
\quad
\mathbf 1_B=1-\mathbf 1_A,
\quad
\mathbf 1_{B_k}=1-\mathbf 1_{A_k}.
$$ 
To summarize, the key formula here is
$$
1-\mathbf 1_A=\prod\limits_{k=1}^n(1-\mathbf 1_{A_k}).\tag{4}
$$
The rest is algebra. Expanding the RHS of (4) yields a sum over every sequence of choices of $1$ or $(-\mathbf 1_{A_k})$, from $k=1$ to $n$. One can choose $(-\mathbf 1_{A_k})$ for every $k$ in $K$ and $1$ for every $k$ not in $K$, and the product is the sum of the results over every possible subset $K$ of $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$, that is,
$$
\prod\limits_{k=1}^n(1-\mathbf 1_{A_k})=\sum\limits_K\prod\limits_{k\in K}(-\mathbf 1_{A_k})=\sum\limits_K(-1)^{|K|}\mathbf 1_{A_K},
\qquad
A_K=\bigcap\limits_{k\in K}A_k.
$$

<blockquote>
  <p>$$
\mathbf 1_A=\sum\limits_{K\ne\varnothing}(-1)^{|K|+1}\mathbf 1_{A_K},
\quad\text{with}\quad
A=\bigcup\limits_{k=1}^nA_k,
\quad
A_K=\bigcap\limits_{k\in K}A_k.
$$</p>

<p>This yields finally the size of $A$ by summation over $x$ in $E$, namely,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$$
|A|=\sum\limits_{K\ne\varnothing}(-1)^{|K|+1}|A_K|.
$$</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that these identities are valid for every number $n$ of sets $A_k$.</p>

<p><em>Example</em> When $n=3$, the sum over the sets $K$ such that  $|K|=1$ is $|A_1|+|A_2|+|A_3|$, the sum over the sets $K$ such that $|K|=2$ is $-1$ times $|A_1\cap A_2|+|A_2\cap A_3|+|A_3\cap A_1|$, and the sum over the sets $K$ such that $|K|=3$ is $|A_1\cap A_2\cap A_3|$, which is the formula in your post.</p>

"Is there a rule of integration that corresponds to the quotient rule?","75571","","<p>When teaching the integration method of u-substitution, I like to emphasize its connection with the chain rule of integration. <br>Likewise, the intimate connection between the product rule of derivatives and the method of integration by parts comes up in discussion. <br><br></p>

  <p>Is there an analogous rule of integration for the quotient rule?  </p>

<p>Of course, if you spot an integral of the form $\int \left (\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \right )' = \int \frac{g(x) \cdot f(x)' - f(x) \cdot g(x)'}{\left [ g(x)\right ]^2 }$,<br>

","<p>As for me, I cannot see an advantage in introduction of such a rule since for any two functions $f,g$ it clearly holds that
$$
\frac fg = f\cdot\frac1g
$$
so the 'quotient rule' for derivatives is a product rule in disguise, and the same will also hold for the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_by_parts"">integration by parts</a>. Indeed, when you are looking for the proper function to put under the differential sign integrating by parts, in case you have a bit of experince with such a procedure, you also will think about the 'quotients'. </p>

<p>As an example:
$$
\int\frac{\sin\frac1x}{x^2}\,dx
$$
Of course you can present it as $\frac{f(x)}{x^2}$ and apply the new integration by parts based on the quotient rule, but I almost sure that a lot of the readers will rather think of the fact that $\frac1{x^2}\,dx = -d\frac1x$, by this seeing a product in the integrand rather than a quotient.</p>

"Is $\frac{\textrm{d}y}{\textrm{d}x}$ not a ratio?","75090","","<p>In the book Thomas's Calculus (11th edition) it is mentioned (Section 3.8 pg 225) that the derivative $\frac{\textrm{d}y}{\textrm{d}x}$ is not a ratio. Couldn't it be interpreted as a ratio, because according to the formula $\textrm{d}y = f'(x)\textrm{d}x$ we are able to plug in values for $\textrm{d}x$ and calculate a $\textrm{d}y$ (differential). Then if we rearrange we get $\frac{\textrm{d}y}{\textrm{d}x}$ which could be seen as a ratio. </p>

<p>I wonder if the author says this because $\textrm{d}x$ is an independent variable, and $\textrm{d}y$ is a dependent variable, for $\frac{\textrm{d}y}{\textrm{d}x}$ to be a ratio both variables need to be independent.. don't they?  </p>
","<p>Historically, when Leibniz conceived of the notation, $\frac{dy}{dx}$ <em>was</em> supposed to be a quotient: it was the quotient of the ""infinitesimal change in $y$ produced by the change in $x$"" divided by the ""infinitesimal change in $x$"". </p>

<p>However, the formulation of calculus with infinitesimals in the usual setting of the real numbers leads to a lot of problems. For one thing, infinitesimals can't exist in the usual setting of real numbers! Because the real numbers satisfy an important property, called the Archimedean Property: given <em>any</em> positive real number $\epsilon\gt 0$, no matter how small, and given any positive real number $M\gt 0$, no matter how big, there exists a natural number $n$ such that $n\epsilon\gt M$. But an ""infinitesimal"" $\xi$ is supposed to be so small that no matter how many times you add it to itself, it never gets to $1$, contradicting the <em>Archimedean Property</em>. Other problems: Leibniz defined the tangent to the graph of $y=f(x)$ at $x=a$ by saying ""Take the point $(a,f(a))$; then add an infinitesimal amount to $a$, $a+dx$, and take the point $(a+dx,f(a+dx))$, and draw the line through those two points."" But if they are two different points on the graph, then it's not a tangent, and if it's just one point, then you can't define the line because you just have one point. That's just two of the problems with infinitesimals. (See below where it says ""<strong>However...</strong>"", though.)</p>

<p>So Calculus was essentially rewritten from the ground up in the following 200 years to avoid these problems, and you are seeing the results of that rewriting (that's where limits came from, for instance). Because of that rewriting, the derivative is no longer a <em>quotient</em>, now it's a <strong>limit</strong>:
$$\lim_{h\to0 }\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}.$$
And because we cannot express this limit-of-a-quotient as a-quotient-of-the-limits (both numerator and denominator go to zero), then the derivative is <em>not</em> a quotient.</p>

<p>However, Leibniz's notation is <em>very</em> suggestive and very useful; even though derivatives are not really quotients, in many ways they behave <em>as if</em> they were quotients. So we have the Chain Rule:
$$\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du}\;\frac{du}{dx}$$
which looks very natural if you think of the derivatives as ""fractions"". You have the Inverse Function theorem, which tells you that
$$\frac{dx}{dy} = \frac{1}{\quad\frac{dy}{dx}\quad},$$
which is again almost ""obvious"" if you think of the derivatives as fractions. So, because the notation is so nice and so suggestive, we keep the notation even though the notation no longer represents an <em>actual</em> quotient, it now represents a single limit.  In fact, Leibniz's notation is so good, so superior to the prime notation and to Newton's notation, that England fell behind all of Europe for <em>centuries</em> in mathematics and science because, due to the fight between Newton's and Leibniz's camp over who had invented Calculus and who stole it from whom (consensus is that they each discovered it independently), England's scientific establishment decided to ignore what was being done in Europe with Leibniz notation and stuck to Newton's... and got stuck in the mud in large part because of it.</p>

<p>(Differentials are part of this same issue: originally, $dy$ and $dx$ really <em>did</em> mean the same thing as those symbols do in $\frac{dy}{dx}$, but that leads to all sorts of logical problems, so they no longer mean the same thing, even though they behave as if they did.)</p>

<p>So, even though we write $\frac{dy}{dx}$ as if it were a fraction, and many computations look like we are working with it <em>like</em> a fraction, it isn't <em>really</em> a fraction (it just plays one on television). </p>

<p><strong>However...</strong> There is a way of getting around the logical difficulties with infinitesimals; this is called <em>nonstandard analysis</em>. It's pretty difficult to explain how one sets it up, but you can think of it as creating two classes of real numbers: the ones you are familiar with, that satisfy things like the Archimedean Property, the Supremum Property, and so on, and then you add another, separate class of real numbers that includes infinitesimals and a bunch of other things. If you do that, then you <em>can</em>, if you are careful, define derivatives exactly like Leibniz, in terms of infinitesimals and actual quotients; if you do that, then all the rules of Calculus that make use of $\frac{dy}{dx}$ <em>as if</em> it were a fraction are justified because, <em>in that setting</em>, it <strong>is</strong> a fraction. Still, one has to be careful because you have to keep infinitesimals and regular real numbers separate and not let them get confused, or you can run into some serious problems. </p>

<p>So I'm having a tough time figuring this one out. I know that I have to work with the characteristic polynomial of the matrix $\det(A-\lambda I)$. But, when considering an $n \times n$ matrix, I do not know how to work out the proof. Should I just use the determinant formula for any $n \times n$ matrix? I'm guessing not, because that is quite complicated. Any insights would be great.</p>
","<p>I think I got it... </p>

<p>Suppose that $\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_n$ are the eigenvalues of $A$. Then the $\lambda$s are also the roots of the characteristic polynomial, i.e.</p>

<p>$$\begin{array}{rcl} \det (A-\lambda I)=p(\lambda)&amp;=&amp;(-1)^n (\lambda - \lambda_1 )(\lambda - \lambda_2)\cdots (\lambda - \lambda_n) \\ &amp;=&amp;(-1) (\lambda - \lambda_1 )(-1)(\lambda - \lambda_2)\cdots (-1)(\lambda - \lambda_n) \\ &amp;=&amp;(\lambda_1 - \lambda )(\lambda_2 - \lambda)\cdots (\lambda_n - \lambda)
\end{array}$$</p>

<p>The first equality follows from the factorization of a polynomial given its roots; the leading (highest degree) coefficient $(-1)^n$ can be obtained by expanding the determinant along the diagonal.</p>

<p>Now, by setting $\lambda$ to zero (simply because it is a variable) we get on the left side $\det(A)$, and on the right side $\lambda_1 \lambda_2\cdots\lambda_n$, that is, we indeed obtain the desired result</p>

<p>$$ \det(A) = \lambda_1 \lambda_2\cdots\lambda_n$$</p>

<p>So the determinant of the matrix is equal to the product of its eigenvalues.</p>

<p>But, how do we justify that the resultant is along the diagonal? Is it just based on experimental evidence? Or is it something that can be proved? </p>

<p><sub>I know, the question might sound pretty obvious, but I'm new to this stuff. :)</sub></p>
","<p>Let $\mathbf{a}\;,\; \mathbf{b}$ be two vectors &amp; let these constitute the sides of a parallelogram such that they are co-initial from one of the vertices of a parallelogram. So, considering assumption that the law be true(this is what we'll judge now whether by taking the assumption for the validity of the law, we can prove something which is earlier ascertained by elementary geometry), the two diagonals are $\mathbf{a + b}\;,\;\mathbf{b -a}$. Sum of the squares of the diagonals is $\left| \mathbf{a + b} \right|^2 + \left| \mathbf{b - a} \right|^2$. Now, from Euclidean Geometry, we get from Parallelogram law which states that,  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>The sum of the squares of the lengths of the four sides of a parallelogram equals the sum of the squares of the lengths of the two diagonals.</code>$^1$ </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, the sum of the squares of the diagonals i.e. $\left| \mathbf{a + b} \right|^2 + \left| \mathbf{b - a} \right|^2 $ must be equal to the sum of the squares of the sides $2(|\mathbf{a}|^2 + |\mathbf{b}|^2)$.</p>

<p>This can be proved by inner product or for this case dot product.</p>

<p>$$\begin{align}  \left| \mathbf{a + b} \right|^2 + \left| \mathbf{b - a} \right|^2 = (\mathbf{a + b}) \cdot (\mathbf{a + b}) + (\mathbf{b - a}) \cdot (\mathbf{b - a}) \end{align} \implies  \left| \mathbf{a + b} \right|^2 + \left| \mathbf{b - a} \right|^2  = 2\mathbf{a}\cdot \mathbf{a} +2\mathbf{b}\cdot \mathbf{b} =2(|\mathbf{a}|^2 + |\mathbf{b}|^2)$$ which makes our assumption that the law is true  absolutely <em>true.</em></p>

He thought it was really cool (kids are easily amused, and so am I).</p>

<p>So he learned that you can turn a shirt or pants right-side-out by pulling the material through any hole, not just certain ones. I told him that even if there was a rip in the shirt, you could use that to turn it inside-out or right-side-out, and he was fascinated by this and asked ""why?""</p>

<p>I don't really know the answer to this. Why is this the case? What if the sleeves of a long-sleeve shirt were sewn together at the cuff, creating a continuous tube from one sleeve to the other? Would you still be able to turn it right-side-out? Why? What properties must a garment have so that it can be turned inside-out and right-side-out?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Wow, I really appreciate all the participation. This is a really pleasant community and I have learned a lot here. It seems that the answer is that you need at least one puncture in the garment through which to push or pull the fabric. It appears that you can have certain handles, although it's not usually practical with clothing due to necessary stretching.</p>

","<p>Everything I'm wearing is a topological sphere with holes (t-shirts have 4, pants 3, shoes and socks 1) in which cases any hole works.  Instead of a long-sleeve shirt with the arms sewn together, consider a pair of pants with legs sewn together to form a topological torus with a hole (so if you were to wear them your feet would be touching and it would be impossible to put your shoes on).  This pair of pants has two parameters which are roughly constant, the circumference of the leg and the total length of the two legs.  When it is turned inside out through the waist, these parameters swap roles, so you will have a tube about the length of a pant leg with an opening on each end, the same as if you had turned one leg inside-out and pushed the other leg through it prior to sewing.  I think this would be possible to do with real toroidal clothing as long as it is thin enough, because the process doesn't require any stretching.</p>

Is there someone here who totally gets it and can explain it?</p>

<p>Why is the concept even useful?</p>
","<p>Let's go through some questions in order and see where it takes us. [Or skip to the bit about complex numbers below if you can't be bothered.]</p>

<p><strong>What are natural numbers?</strong></p>

<p>It took quite some evolution, but humans are blessed by their ability to notice that there is a similarity between the situations of having three apples in your hand and having three eggs in your hand. Or, indeed, three twigs or three babies or three spots. Or even three knocks at the door. And we generalise all of these situations by calling it 'three'; same goes for the other natural numbers. This is not the construction we usually take in maths, but it's how we learn what numbers are.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Natural numbers are what allow us to count a finite collection of things. We call this set of numbers $\mathbb{N}$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>What are integers?</strong></p>

<p>Once we've learnt how to measure quantity, it doesn't take us long before we need to measure change, or relative quantity. If I'm holding three apples and you take away two, I now have 'two fewer' apples than I had before; but if you gave me two apples I'd have 'two more'. We want to measure these changes on the same scale (rather than the separate scales of 'more' and 'less'), and we do this by introducing negative natural numbers: the net increase in apples is $-2$.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We get the integers from the naturals by allowing ourselves to take numbers away: $\mathbb{Z}$ is the closure of $\mathbb{N}$ under the operation $-$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>What are rational numbers?</strong></p>

<p>My friend and I are pretty hungry at this point but since you came along and stole two of my apples I only have one left. Out of mutual respect we decide we should each have the same quantity of apple, and so we cut it down the middle. We call the quantity of apple we each get 'a half', or $\frac{1}{2}$. The net change in apple after I give my friend his half is $-\frac{1}{2}$.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We get the rationals from the integers by allowing ourselves to divide integers by positive integers [or, equivalently, by nonzero integers]: $\mathbb{Q}$ is (sort of) the closure of $\mathbb{Z}$ under the operation $\div$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>What are real numbers?</strong></p>

<p>I find some more apples and put them in a pie, which I cook in a circular dish. One of my friends decides to get smart, and asks for a slice of the pie whose curved edge has the same length as its straight edges (i.e. arc length of the circular segment is equal to its radius). I decide to honour his request, and using our newfangled rational numbers I try to work out how many such slices I could cut. But I can't quite get there: it's somewhere between $6$ and $7$; somewhere between $\frac{43}{7}$ and $\frac{44}{7}$; somewhere between $\frac{709}{113}$ and $\frac{710}{113}$; and so on, but no matter how accurate I try and make the fractions, I never quite get there. So I decide to call this number $2\pi$ (<a href=""http://tauday.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">or $\tau$?</a>) and move on with my life.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The reals turn the rationals into a continuum, filling the holes which can be approximated to arbitrary degrees of accuracy but never actually reached: $\mathbb{R}$ is the completion of $\mathbb{Q}$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>What are complex numbers?</strong> [Finally!]</p>

<p>Our real numbers prove to be quite useful. If I want to make a pie which is twice as big as my last one but still circular then I'll use a dish whose radius is $\sqrt{2}$ times bigger. If I decide this isn't enough and I want to make it thrice as big again then I'll use a dish whose radius is $\sqrt{3}$ times as big as the last. But it turns out that to get this dish I could have made the original one thrice as big and then that one twice as big; the order in which I increase the size of the dish has no effect on what I end up with. And I could have done it in one go, making it six times as big by using a dish whose radius is $\sqrt{6}$ times as big. This leads to my discovery of the fact that multiplication corresponds to scaling $-$ they obey the same rules. (Multiplication by negative numbers responds to scaling and then flipping.)</p>

<p>But I can also spin a pie around. Rotating it by one angle and then another has the same effect as rotating it by the second angle and then the first $-$ the order in which I carry out the rotations has no effect on what I end up with, just like with scaling. Does this mean we can model rotation with some kind of multiplication, where multiplication of these new numbers corresponds to addition of the angles? If I could, then I'd be able to rotate a point on the pie by performing a sequence of multiplications. I notice that if I rotate my pie by $90^{\circ}$ four times then it ends up how it was, so I'll declare this $90^{\circ}$ rotation to be multiplication by '$i$' and see what happens. We've seen that $i^4=1$, and with our funky real numbers we know that $i^4=(i^2)^2$ and so $i^2 = \pm 1$. But $i^2 \ne 1$ since rotating twice doesn't leave the pie how it was $-$ it's facing the wrong way; so in fact $i^2=-1$. This then also obeys the rules for multiplication by negative real numbers.</p>

<p>Upon further experimentation with spinning pies around we discover that defining $i$ in this way leads to numbers (formed by adding and multiplying real numbers with this new '$i$' beast) which, under multiplication, <em>do</em> indeed correspond to combined scalings and rotations in a 'number plane', which contains our previously held 'number line'. What's more, they can be multiplied, divided and rooted as we please. It then has the fun consequence that any polynomial with coefficients of this kind has as many roots as its degree; what fun!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The complex numbers allow us to consider scalings and rotations as two instances of the same thing; and by ensuring that negative reals have square roots, we get something where <em>every</em> (non-constant) polynomial equation can be solved: $\mathbb{C}$ is the algebraic closure of $\mathbb{R}$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[<em>Final edit ever</em>: It occurs to me that I never mentioned anything to do with anything 'imaginary', since I presumed that Sachin really wanted to know about the <em>complex</em> numbers as a whole. But for the sake of completeness: the <strong>imaginary numbers</strong> are precisely the real multiples of $i$ $-$ you scale the pie and rotate it by $90^{\circ}$ in either direction. They are the rotations/scalings which, when performed twice, leave the pie facing backwards; that is, they are the numbers which square to give negative real numbers.]</p>

<p><strong>What next?</strong></p>

<p>I've been asked in the comments to mention <strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion"" rel=""noreferrer"">quaternions</a></strong> and <strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octonion"" rel=""noreferrer"">octonions</a></strong>. These go (even further) beyond what the question is asking, so I won't dwell on them, but the idea is: my friends and I are actually aliens from a multi-dimensional world and simply aren't satisfied with a measly $2$-dimensional number system. By extending the principles from our so-called complex numbers we get systems which include copies of $\mathbb{C}$ and act in many ways like numbers, but now (unless we restrict ourselves to one of the copies of $\mathbb{C}$) the order in which we carry out our weird multi-dimensional symmetries <em>does</em> matter. But, with them, we can do lots of science.</p>

<p>I have also completely omitted any mention of <strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_number"" rel=""noreferrer"">ordinal numbers</a></strong>, because they fork off in a different direction straight after the naturals. We get some very exciting stuff out of these, but we don't find $\mathbb{C}$ because it doesn't have any natural order relation on it.</p>

<p><strong>Historical note</strong></p>

<p>The above succession of stages is <em>not</em> a historical account of how numbers of different types are discovered. I don't claim to know an awful lot about the history of mathematics, but I know enough to know that the concept of a number evolved in different ways in different cultures, likely due to practical implications. In particular, it is very unlikely that complex numbers were devised geometrically as rotations-and-scalings $-$ the needs of the time were <em>algebraic</em> and people were throwing away (perfectly valid) equations because they didn't think $\sqrt{-1}$ could exist. Their geometric properties were discovered soon after.</p>

<p>However, this <em>is</em> roughly the sequence in which these number sets are (usually) constructed in ZF set theory and we have a nice sequence of inclusions
$$1 \hookrightarrow \mathbb{N} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{Z} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{Q} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}$$</p>

"Mathematical difference between white and black notes in a piano","72845","","<p>The division of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_scale"">chromatic scale</a> in $7$ natural notes (white keys in a piano) and $5$ <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_%28music%29"">accidental</a> ones (black) seems a bit arbitrary to me.</p>

<p>Apparently, adjacent notes in a piano (including white or black) are always separated by a semitone. Why the distinction, then? Why not just have scales with $12$ notes? (apparently there's a musical scale called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swara"">Swara</a> that does just that)</p>

<p>I've asked several musician friends, but they lack the math preparation for giving me a valid answer. ""Notes are like that because they are like that"".</p>

<p>I need some mathematician with musical knowledge (or a musician with mathematical knowledge) to help me out with this.</p>

<p>Mathematically, is there any difference between white and black notes, or do we make the distinction just for historical reasons?</p>
","<p>The first thing you have to understand is that notes are not uniquely defined.  Everything depends on what tuning you use.  I'll assume we're talking about <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_temperament"" rel=""noreferrer"">equal temperament</a> here.  In equal temperament, a half-step is the same as a frequency ratio of $\sqrt[12]{2}$; that way, twelve half-steps makes up an octave.  Why twelve?</p>

<p>At the end of the day, what we want out of our musical frequencies are nice ratios of small lintegers.  For example, a perfect fifth is supposed to correspond to a frequency ratio of $3 : 2$, or $1.5 : 1$, but in equal temperament it doesn't; instead, it corresponds to a ratio of $2^{ \frac{7}{12} } : 1 \approx 1.498 : 1$.  As you can see, this is not a fifth; however, it is quite close.</p>

<p>Similarly, a perfect fourth is supposed to correspond to a frequency ratio of $4 : 3$, or $1.333... : 1$, but in equal temperament it corresponds to a ratio of $2^{ \frac{5}{12} } : 1 \approx 1.335 : 1$.  Again, this is not a perfect fourth, but is quite close.</p>

<p>And so on.  What's going on here is a massively convenient mathematical coincidence: several of the powers of $\sqrt[12]{2}$ happen to be good approximations to ratios of small integers, and there are enough of these to play Western music.  </p>

<p>Here's how this coincidence works.  You get the white keys from $C$ using (part of) the circle of fifths.  Start with $C$ and go up a fifth to get $G$, then $D$, then $A$, then $E$, then $B$.  Then go down a fifth to get $F$.  These are the ""neighbors"" of $C$ in the circle of fifths.  You get the black keys from here using the rest of the circle of fifths.  After you've gone up a ""perfect"" perfect fifth twelve times, you get a frequency ratio of $3^{12} : 2^{12} \approx 129.7 : 1$.  This happens to be rather close to $2^7 : 1$, or seven octaves!  And if we replace $3 : 2$ by $2^{ \frac{7}{12} } : 1$, then we get exactly seven octaves.  In other words, the reason you can afford to identify these intervals is because $3^{12}$ happens to be rather close to $2^{19}$.  Said another way, </p>

<p>$$\log_2 3 \approx \frac{19}{12}$$</p>

<p>happens to be a good rational approximation, and this is the main basis of equal temperament.  (The other main coincidence here is that $\log_2 \frac{5}{4} \approx \frac{4}{12}$; this is what allows us to squeeze major thirds into equal temperament as well.)</p>

<p>It is a fundamental fact of mathematics that $\log_2 3$ is irrational, so it is impossible for any kind of equal temperament to have ""perfect"" perfect fifths regardless of how many notes you use.  However, you can write down good rational approximations by looking at the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continued_fraction"" rel=""noreferrer"">continued fraction</a> of $\log_2 3$ and writing down convergents, and these will correspond to equal-tempered scales with more notes.  </p>

<p>Of course, you can use other types of temperament, such as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well_temperament"" rel=""noreferrer"">well temperament</a>; if you stick to $12$ notes (which not everybody does!), you will be forced to make some intervals sound better and some intervals sound worse.  In particular, if you don't use equal temperament then <strong>different keys sound different.</strong>  This is a major reason many Western composers composed in different keys; during their time, this actually made a difference.  As a result when you're playing certain sufficiently old pieces you aren't actually playing them as they were intended to be heard - you're using the wrong tuning.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>  I suppose it is also good to say something about why we care about frequency ratios which are ratios of small integers.  This has to do with the physics of sound, and I'm not particularly knowledgeable here, but this is my understanding of the situation.</p>

<p>You probably know that sound is a wave.  More precisely, sound is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_wave"" rel=""noreferrer"">longitudinal wave</a> carried by air molecules.  You might think that there is a simple equation for the sound created by a single note, perhaps $\sin 2\pi f t$ if the corresponding tone has frequency $f$.  Actually this only occurs for tones which are produced electronically; any tone you produce in nature carries with it <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtone"" rel=""noreferrer"">overtones</a> and has a Fourier series</p>

<p>$$\sum \left( a_n \sin 2 \pi n f t + b_n \cos 2 \pi n f t \right)$$</p>

<p>where the coefficients $a_n, b_n$ determine the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbre"" rel=""noreferrer"">timbre</a> of the sound; this is why different instruments sound different even when they play the same notes, and has to do with the physics of vibration, which I don't understand too well.  So any tone which you hear at frequency $f$ almost certainly also has components at frequency $2f, 3f, 4f, ...$.  </p>

<p>If you play two notes of frequencies $f, f'$ together, then the resulting sound corresponds to what you get when you add their Fourier series.  Now it's not hard to see that if $\frac{f}{f'}$ is a ratio of small integers, then many (but not all) of the overtones will match in frequency with each other; the result sounds a more complex note with certain overtones.  Otherwise, you get dissonance as you hear both types of overtones simultaneously and their frequencies will be similar, but not similar enough.  </p>

","<p>Given any two vectors $a$ and $b$, the vector cross product $a\times b$ will be perpendicular to both of them, even if we have to consider the degenerate case of $0$ (that is, zero is perpendicular to anything).</p>

<p>With three distinct points $x_1,x_2,x_3$ we have a triangle, and this triangle determines a plane. Note that the triangle is determined by any <em>two</em> of its sides - and so is the plane then. Sides correspond to displacement vectors between the three points, i.e. we can set $a=x_2-x_1$, $b=x_3-x_1$ without losing generality (that is, it won't matter what order we understand the points to be in, the resulting displacement vectors will determine the same exact plane). Finally, since the points are distinct, the displacement vectors are nonzero, and if we assume they are noncollinear the displacements are also nonparallel, so their cross product will be nondegenerate (nonzero). (Non non non non...)</p>

<p>Since we're working in three dimensions, any vector perpendicular to these two displacement vectors will be perpendicular to the plane they determine, <em>and</em> vice versa, so we can use the cross product of these displacement vectors to determine the normal vector, up to various scalings.</p>

<p>With $i,j,k$ the orthonormal basis, the cross product is computed via the ""pseudo-determinant""</p>

"What is the difference between a sound argument and a valid argument?","72428","","<p>In my notes, these are the definitions of a valid argument</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An argument form is <strong>valid</strong> if and only if whenever the premises are all true, then
  conclusion is true. An argument is <strong>valid</strong> if its argument form is <strong>valid</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For a sound argument,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An argument is <strong>sound</strong> if and only if it is <strong>valid</strong> and all its premises are true.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay so to me, both definitions pretty much says the same thing to me. On a philosophy forum, I see that they distinguish the two by saying a valid argument is such that the truth value of the premises necessarily imply the truth values of the conclusion.</p>

<p>For example, the ""Elimination"" method say</p>

<p>$p \vee q$</p>

<p>$\sim q$</p>

<p>$\therefore p$</p>

<p>So the premises are $p \vee q$ and $\sim q$</p>

<p>Now if I were to substitute $p$ and $q$ for $p$ := ""Jesse is my husband"" and q:= ""I am Jesse's wife"" (assume p is true and q is true)</p>

<p>Then we have</p>

<p>Either ""Jesse is my husband"" or ""I am Jesse's wife""</p>

<p>""I am <strong>not</strong> Jesse's wife""</p>

<p>Therefore, ""Jesse is my husband""</p>

<p>So is this technically still valid or sound? (can't tell the difference) Both premises are true, but the conclusion is false? It should invalid right? Yet the method of elimination is said to be <strong>valid</strong>?</p>
","<p>A sound argument is necessarily valid, but a valid argument need not be sound. The argument form that derives <em>every</em> $A$ <em>is a</em> $C$ from the premises <em>every</em> $A$ <em>is a</em> $B$ and <em>every</em> $B$ <em>is a</em> $C$, is valid, so every instance of it is a valid argument. Now take $A$ to be <em>prime number</em>, $B$ to be <em>multiple of</em> $4$, and $C$ to be <em>even number</em>. The argument is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If every prime number is a multiple of $4$, and every multiple of $4$ is an even number, then every prime number is even.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This argument is valid: it’s an instance of the valid argument form given above. It is not sound, however, because the first premise is false.</p>

<p>Your example is not a sound argument: $q$ is true, so the premise $\sim q$ is false. It <strong>is</strong> a valid argument, however, because for any $p$ and $q$, if $p\lor q$ and $\sim q$ are both true, then $p$ must indeed be true.</p>

<p>Note that an unsound argument may have a true or a false conclusion. Your unsound argument has a true conclusion, $p$ (Jesse is my husband); mine above has a false conclusion (every prime number is even).</p>

","<p>You seem to be having a good deal of trouble with this, over several questions. At the same time, I am confident that you will get no satisfying answers as long as you stick with the terminology you are using. Maybe on the original stack overflow site, aimed at programmers. </p>

<p>Please read this:
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternions_and_spatial_rotation"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternions_and_spatial_rotation</a></p>

<p>and this: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternions"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternions</a></p>

<p>To answer not much more than your question, any quaternion is an expression
$$ q = w + x \; \mathbf{i} + y \; \mathbf{j} + z \; \mathbf{k}.$$
where the multiplication rules use 
$$ \mathbf{i}^2 =  \mathbf{j}^2 = \mathbf{k}^2 = \mathbf{i} \mathbf{j}\mathbf{k} = -1, $$ and consequences of those, see wikipedia as I said.
Any quaternion $ q = w + x \; \mathbf{i} + y \; \mathbf{j} + z \; \mathbf{k}$ has a conjugate, that on wikipedia is written $q^\ast,$ given by
$$ q^\ast = w - x \; \mathbf{i} - y \; \mathbf{j} - z \; \mathbf{k}.$$</p>

<p>The ""norm"" of the quaternion $q$ is exactly $$ \parallel q \parallel^2 = w^2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = q q^\ast = q^\ast q$$</p>

<p>A quaternion $q$ is called a ""unit"" quaternion when $$ w^2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1. $$</p>

<p>A quaternion is called ""pure"" or a vector in 3-space when $ w = 0,$ so a vector in 3-space is
$$ v =   v_1 \; \mathbf{i} + v_2 \; \mathbf{j} + v_3 \; \mathbf{k} $$
I have no idea what engineers and programmers call these concepts. You are asking mathematicians.</p>

<p>Given two quaternions, the norm of the product is the product of the norms. </p>

<p>The ""real part"" (the $w$) of the product of two quaternions $pq$ is the same as the ""real part of $qp.$</p>

<p>So, what happens when I take a unit quaternion $q$ and a ""pure"" quaternion $v,$ and calculate
$$ p = q^\ast v q.$$</p>

<p>Well, we have $$\parallel p \parallel   = 1 \cdot \parallel v \parallel \cdot 1 = \parallel v \parallel $$</p>

<p>But as to the ""real part,"" we begin with
$$ \Re v = 0,$$</p>

<p>then
$$ \Re q^\ast (v q) = \Re  (v q) q^\ast = \Re  v (q q^\ast) = \Re v = 0. $$</p>

<p>So $ p = q^\ast v q$ is another pure quaternion, another ""vector,"" the same length as $v,$ but rotated from where it was.</p>

<p>Take for example the RSA encryption system: All arithmetic is done modulo $n$, with $n=pq$ and $p,q$ large primes. Decryption in this system relies on computing Euler's phi function, $\varphi(n)$, which is hard to compute (hence the system is hard to break) <strong>unless</strong> you know the prime factorization of $n$ (which is also hard to compute unless you know it upfront).

<p>I'd like to know the whole derivation so I can understand it (again) ...</p>

<p>Enlightenment, please! Thanks.</p>
","<p>Suppose that the unknown width and height are $x$ and $y$, and you’re given a diagonal $d$ and a ratio $m:n$ of width to height. That ratio means that the width is $\frac{m}{n}$ times the height, so you know that $x=\frac{m}{n}y$. You get a second relationship between $x$ and $y$ from the Pythagorean theorem: $x$, $y$, and $d$ are the lengths of the two legs and the hypotenuse of a right triangle, so $x^2+y^2=d^2$.</p>

<p>Now substitute $\frac{m}{n}y$ for $x$ in this second equation to get $\displaystyle\left(\frac{m}{n}y\right)^2 + y^2 = d^2$. Simplifying this, you get in turn: $$\frac{m^2}{n^2}y^2 + y^2 = d^2,$$ $$\left(\frac{m^2}{n^2}+1\right)y^2 = d^2,$$ $$\left(\frac{m^2+n^2}{n^2}\right)y^2=d^2,$$ and $$(m^2+n^2)y^2=d^2n^2.$$  Finally, solve for $y$: $\displaystyle y^2 = \frac{d^2n^2}{m^2+n^2}$, so $y=\displaystyle\frac{dn}{\sqrt{m^2+n^2}}$.<br>
Once you have a numerical value for $y$, you can plug it into $x=\frac{m}{n}y$ to get a value for $x$.<br>

"How to find the factorial of a fraction?","70216","","<p>From what I know, the factorial function is defined as follows:</p>

<p>$$n! = n(n-1)(n-2) \cdots(3)(2)(1)$$</p>

<p>And $0! = 1$. However, <a href=""http://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/factorial.html"">this page</a> seems to be saying that you can take the factorial of a fraction, like, for instance, $\frac{1}{2}!$, which they claim is equal to $\frac{1}{2}\sqrt\pi$ due to something called the gamma function. Moreover, they start getting the factorial of negative numbers, like $-\frac{1}{2}! = \sqrt{\pi}$</p>

<p><strong>How is this possible? What is the definition of the factorial of a fraction? What about negative numbers?</strong></p>

<p>I tried researching it on Wikipedia and such, but there doesn't seem to be a clear-cut answer.</p>
","<p>The gamma function is defined by the following integral, which converges for real $s&gt;0$:
$$\Gamma(s)=\int_0^\infty t^{s-1}e^{-t}dt.$$</p>

<p>The function can also be extended into the complex plane, if you're familiar with that subject. I'll assume not and just let $s$ be real.</p>

<p>This function is like the factorial in the when $s$ is a positive integer, say $s=n$, it satisfies $\Gamma(n)=(n-1)!$. It generalizes the factorial in the sense that it <em>is</em> the factorial for positive integer arguments, and is also well-defined for positive rational (and even real) numbers. This is what it means to take a ""rational factorial,"" but I would hesitate to call it that. Many functions have those two properties, and $\Gamma$ is chosen out of all of them because it is the most useful in other applications. Rather than the notation used in that article you refer to, it would be more accurate for you to say that ""the gamma function takes these values for these arguments."" Gamma is not a function that intends to generalize factorials; rather, generalizing factorials came along as something of an accident following the definition. Its true purpose is deeper.</p>

<p>As for why $\Gamma(1/2)=\sqrt{\pi}$, this comes out of an interesting property of the $\Gamma$ function: some of them are here <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function#Properties"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function#Properties</a>. The property you are interested in is the reflection formula: $$\Gamma(1-z)\Gamma(z)=\frac{\pi}{\sin(\pi z)}.$$ Set $z=1/2$ in the formula to get the desired identity.</p>

<p>If you want to learn more about the gamma function, the hard way is to learn a lot more math, in particular real and complex analysis. An easier way is to read this excellent set of notes: <a href=""http://www.sosmath.com/calculus/improper/gamma/gamma.html"">http://www.sosmath.com/calculus/improper/gamma/gamma.html</a>.</p>

"Do factorials really grow faster than exponential functions?","70213","","<p>Having trouble understanding this. Is there anyway to prove it?</p>

<p>$$a^n=a\times a\times a\times a...\times a$$
$$n!=1\times 2\times 3\times 4...\times n$$</p>

<p>Now what happens as $n$ gets much bigger than $a$? In this case, when $n$ is huge, $a$ will have been near some number pretty early in the factorial sequence. The exponential sequence is still being multiplied by that (relatively tiny) number at each step, while $n!$ is being multiplied by $n$. So even if $n!$ starts out small, it'll eventually start being multiplied by <em>gigantic</em> numbers at each step, and quickly outgrow the exponential. If $a=10$ and $n=100$, then $a^n$ has around $100$ digits, while $n!$ has over $150$ digits. Note that near $n=100$, $n!$ is having roughly 2 digits added per step (and that rate will only increase), while $a^n$ is still only ever going to get one more with every step. No contest.</p>

"How do I know which method of revolution to use for finding volume in Calculus?","69973","","<p>Is there any easy way to decide which method I should use to find the volume of a revolution in Calculus? I'm currently in the middle of my second attempt at Calculus II, and I am getting tripped up once again by this concept, which seems like it should be rather straight forward, but I can't figure it out. If I have the option of the disk/washer method and the shell method, how do I know which one I should use?</p>
","<p>The first thing to understand is that you <strong>don’t</strong> directly choose the method of integration: you determine what kind of integration will be easier, based on the shape of the region in question, and <strong>that</strong> determines which method you’ll use.</p>

<p>Draw the region that’s being revolved. Then ask yourself: does it slice up nicely into vertical strips, or do horizontal strips work better? </p>

<ol>
<li><p>If the region has boundaries of the form $y=f(x)$, $y=g(x)$, $x=a$, and $x=b$, the answer is almost always that vertical strips are simpler: for each $x$ from $a$ to $b$ you have a strip of length $f(x)-g(x)$ or $g(x)-f(x)$, depending on which of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ is larger.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, if the region has boundaries of the form $x=f(y)$, $x=g(y)$, $y=a$, and $y=b$, the answer is almost always that horizontal strips are simpler: for each $y$ from $a$ to $b$ you have a strip of length $f(y)-g(y)$ or $g(y)-f(y)$, depending on which of $f(y)$ and $g(y)$ is larger.</p></li>
<li><p>The case of a region bounded by $y=f(x)$ and $y=g(x)$, where you have to solve for the points of intersection of the two curves in order to find the horizontal extent of the region, is really just special case of (1). Similarly, if the region is bounded by $x=f(y)$ and $x=g(y)$, and you have to solve for the vertical extent of the region, you’re looking at a special case of (2).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>What you want is a way of slicing the region into vertical or horizontal strips whose endpoints are defined in the same way. Take, for instance, the region bounded by $y=x$ and $y=x(x-1)$. If you slice it into vertical strips, each strip runs from the parabola at the bottom to the straight line at the top, so the strip at each $x$ between $0$ and $2$ has its bottom end at $x(x-1)$ and its top end at $x$. If you were to slice it into horizontal strips, the ones between $y=0$ and $y=2$ would have their left ends on the straight line and their right ends on the parabola, but the ones between $y=-1/4$ and $y=0$ would have both ends on the parabola. Thus, you’d need a different calculation to handle the part of the region below the $x$-axis from the one that you’d need for the part above the $x$-axis.</p>

<p>Whether the boundaries are given in the form $y=f(x)$ or the form $x=f(y)$ is often a good indication: the former tends to go with vertical slices and the latter with horizontal slices. It’s far from infallible, however, and in some problems some boundaries are given in one form and some in the other. You should <strong>always</strong> look at a picture of the region. You want slices whose endpoints are defined consistently, and you want slices that don’t have any gaps in them.</p>

<p>Once you’ve decided which way to slice up the region, sketch in the axis of revolution. If it’s parallel to your slices, each slice will trace out a cylindrical shell as it revolves about the axis. If, on the other hand, it’s perpendicular to your slices, each slice will trace out a washer or disk as it revolves about the axis. In either case the proper method of integration has automatically been determined for you.</p>

Now we have to evaluate this limit.</p>

<p>If we try to evaluate this limit by just plugging in $x = 1$, we get $0/0$, which is a problem (dividing by zero is bad), so we need a new strategy.</p>

<p>Idea: When evaluating the limits of fractions, a good trick is to multiply the top and bottom by the ""radical conjugate."" So:</p>

<p>$$\begin{align}
\frac{\sqrt{x} - 1}{x-1} &amp; = \frac{\sqrt{x} - 1}{x-1}\frac{\sqrt{x} + 1}{\sqrt{x} + 1} \\
&amp; = \frac{(\sqrt{x} - 1)(\sqrt{x} + 1)}{(x-1)(\sqrt{x} + 1)} \\
&amp; = \frac{x - 1}{(x-1)(\sqrt{x} + 1)} \\
&amp; = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x} + 1}.
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>Now we can evaluate $$\lim_{x \to 1} \frac{\sqrt{x} - 1}{x-1} = \lim_{x\to 1}\frac{1}{\sqrt{x} + 1}$$ by plugging in $x = 1$ no problem.  This will give us the <em>slope</em> of the tangent line.  If you want the equation of the tangent line, you need the point-slope formula, explained below.</p>

<hr>

<p>The point-slope formula says that a line with slope $m$ that passes through $(x_0, y_0)$ has an equation of the form $$y - y_0 = m(x-x_0).$$</p>

<p>In your case, the tangent line passes through $(1,1)$, so you can plug in $x_0 = 1$, $y_0 = 1$.  We'll also have the slope, $m$, from the previous section once we evaluate that limit (which I leave to you to do).</p>

<p>Why is the reversal of inequality? What is going in terms of number line that will help me understand the concept better?</p>
","<p>Dividing by a negative number is the same as dividing by a positive number and then multiplying by $-1$. Dividing an inequality by a positive number retains the same inequality. But, multiplying by $-1$ is the same as switching the signs of the numbers on both sides of the inequality, which reverses the inequality:
$$
\tag{1} a\lt b\quad\iff -a\gt -b.
$$
You should be able to convince yourself why the above is true by looking at the number line and considering the various cases involved.</p>

<hr>

<p>Seeing why (1) is true is not too hard.</p>

<p>Here is the hand waving approach I suggested above:</p>

<p>Consider, for example, in (1), the case when $a$ is negative and $b$ is positive. 
We have $a&lt;b$. Then $-a$ is positive and $-b$ is negative. Thus,  we have $-b&lt;-a$.</p>

<p>As another case, suppose $a$ and $b$ are both negative with $a&lt;b$.  Switching the signs here
makes the resulting numbers both positive with $-a&gt;-b$ (you can see this by drawing the points on the number line and noting that with the given conditions, $b$ is closer to the origin than $a$):</p>

<p>Then it asks if the two variables are independent and I understand how to answer that, I just keep getting the wrong marginal pdfs.</p>

<p>Here is my attempted work so far:</p>

<p>At first I did what was was necessary to find marginal pdfs for <strong>discrete</strong> random variables and summed leading me to the pdfs</p>

<p>$$f_1(x) = \frac{7x}{16} \text{ and } f_2(y) = \frac{3y^2}{16}.$$</p>

<p>Clearly this is wrong.</p>

<p>I realized my mistake and attempted to do what is necessary to find the marginal pdf for continuous random variables. So I used integrals and setup the following:</p>

<p>$$f_1(x) = \int_0^2 \frac{3}{16}xy^2 ~dy = \left. \frac{1}{3}y^3 \right|_0^2 = \frac{24}{48}.$$</p>

","<p>You have the right idea to integrate against $y$ to find the $x$-marginal, and integrate against $x$ to find the $y$-marginal, but you've forgotten to pull out the other variable as a constant: </p>

  <p>You have the option to throw a die up to three times.  You will earn
  the face value of the die.  You have the option to stop after each
  throw and walk away with the money earned. The earnings are not additive. What is the expected payoff of this game?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I found a solution <a href=""http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/68228.html"">here</a> but I don't understand it. </p>
","<p>Let's suppose we have only 1 roll. What is the expected payoff? Each roll is equally likely, so it will show $1,2,3,4,5,6$ with equal probability. Thus their average of $3.5$ is the expected payoff.</p>

<p>Now let's suppose we have 2 rolls. If on the first roll, I roll a $6$, I would not continue. The next throw would only maintain my winnings of $6$ (with $1/6$ chance) or make me lose. Similarly, if I threw a $5$ or a $4$ on the first roll, I would not continue, because my expected payoff on the last throw would be a $3.5$. However, if I threw a $1,2$ of $3$, I would take that second round. This is again because I expect to win $3.5$.</p>

<p>So in the 2 roll game, if I roll a $4,5,6$, I keep those rolls, but if I throw a $1,2,3$, I reroll. Thus I have a $1/2$ chance of keeping a $4,5,6$, or a $1/2$ chance of rerolling. Rerolling has an expected return of $3.5$. As the $4,5,6$ are equally likely, rolling a $4,5$ or $6$ has expected return $5$. Thus my expected payout on 2 rolls is $.5(5) + .5(3.5) = 4.25$.</p>

<p>Now we go to the 3 roll game. If I roll a $5$ or $6$, I keep my roll. But now, even a $4$ is undesirable, because by rerolling, I'd be playing the 2 roll game, which has expected payout of $4.25$. So now the expected payout is $\frac{1}{3}(5.5) + \frac{2}{3}(4.25) = 4.\overline{66}$.</p>

$$\zeta(2)=\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2}=\frac{\pi^2}{6}.$$
However, Euler was Euler and he gave other proofs. </p>

<p>I believe many of you know some nice proofs of this, can you please share it with us?</p>
","<p>OK, here's my favorite. I thought of this after reading a proof from the book ""Proofs from the book"" by Aigner &amp; Ziegler, but later I found more or less the same proof as mine in <a href=""http://homepage.univie.ac.at/josef.hofbauer/02amm.pdf"">a paper</a> published a few years earlier by Josef Hofbauer. On Robin's list, the proof most similar to this is number 9
(EDIT: ...which is actually the proof that I read in Aigner &amp; Ziegler).</p>

<p>When $0 &lt; x &lt; \pi/2$ we have $0&lt;\sin x &lt; x &lt; \tan x$ and thus
$$\frac{1}{\tan^2 x} &lt; \frac{1}{x^2} &lt; \frac{1}{\sin^2 x}.$$
Note that $1/\tan^2 x = 1/\sin^2 x - 1$.
Split the interval $(0,\pi/2)$ into $2^n$ equal parts, and sum
the inequality over the (inner) ""gridpoints"" $x_k=(\pi/2) \cdot (k/2^n)$:
$$\sum_{k=1}^{2^n-1} \frac{1}{\sin^2 x_k} - \sum_{k=1}^{2^n-1} 1 &lt; \sum_{k=1}^{2^n-1} \frac{1}{x_k^2} &lt; \sum_{k=1}^{2^n-1} \frac{1}{\sin^2 x_k}.$$
Denoting the sum on the right-hand side by $S_n$, we can write this as
$$S_n - (2^n - 1) &lt; \sum_{k=1}^{2^n-1} \left( \frac{2 \cdot 2^n}{\pi} \right)^2 \frac{1}{k^2} &lt; S_n.$$</p>

<p>Although $S_n$ looks like a complicated sum, it can actually be computed fairly easily. To begin with,
$$\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 (\frac{\pi}{2}-x)} = \frac{\cos^2 x + \sin^2 x}{\cos^2 x \cdot \sin^2 x} = \frac{4}{\sin^2 2x}.$$
Therefore, if we pair up the terms in the sum $S_n$ except the midpoint $\pi/4$ (take the point $x_k$ in the left half of the interval $(0,\pi/2)$ together with the point $\pi/2-x_k$ in the right half) we get 4 times a sum of the same form, but taking twice as big steps so that we only sum over every other gridpoint; that is, over those gridpoints that correspond to splitting the interval into $2^{n-1}$ parts. And the midpoint $\pi/4$ contributes with $1/\sin^2(\pi/4)=2$ to the sum. In short,
$$S_n = 4 S_{n-1} + 2.$$
Since $S_1=2$, the solution of this recurrence is
$$S_n = \frac{2(4^n-1)}{3}.$$
(For example like this: the particular (constant) solution $(S_p)_n = -2/3$ plus the general solution to the homogeneous equation $(S_h)_n = A \cdot 4^n$, with the constant $A$ determined by the initial condition $S_1=(S_p)_1+(S_h)_1=2$.)</p>

<p>We now have
$$ \frac{2(4^n-1)}{3} - (2^n-1) \leq  \frac{4^{n+1}}{\pi^2} \sum_{k=1}^{2^n-1} \frac{1}{k^2}  \leq \frac{2(4^n-1)}{3}.$$
Multiply by $\pi^2/4^{n+1}$ and let $n\to\infty$. This squeezes the partial sums between two sequences both tending to $\pi^2/6$. Voilà!</p>

"How to get principal argument of complex number from complex plane?","67206","","<p>I am just starting to learn calculus and the concepts of radians. Something that is confusing me is how my textbook is getting the principal argument ($\arg z$) from the complex plane. i.e. for the complex number $-2 + 2i$, how does it get $\frac{3\pi}{4}$? (I get $\frac{\pi}{4}$).  </p>

<p>The formula is $\tan^{-1}(\frac{b}{a})$, and I am getting $\frac{\pi}{4}$ when I calculate $\tan^{-1}(\frac{2}{-2})$. When I draw it I see that the point is in quadrant 2.</p>

<p>So how do you compute the correct value of the principal argument? </p>
","<p>The principal value of $\tan^{-1}\theta$ is always between $-\frac{\pi}2$ and $\frac{\pi}2$. The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_%28complex_analysis%29#Principal_value"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">principal value of $\arg z$</a>, on the other hand, is always in the interval $(-\pi,\pi]$. Thus, for $z$ in the first quadrant it’s between $0$ and $\frac{\pi}2$; for $z$ in the second quadrant it’s between $\frac{\pi}2$ and $\pi$; for $z$ in the third quadrant it’s between $-\frac{\pi}2$ and $-\pi$; and for $z$ in the fourth quadrant it’s between $0$ and $-\frac{\pi}2$. This means that the $\tan^{-1}$ function gives you the correct angle only when $z$ is in the first and fourth quadrants. </p>

<p>When $z$ is in the second quadrant, you have to find an angle between $\frac{\pi}2$ and $\pi$ that has the same tangent as the angle $\theta$ returned by the $\tan^{-1}$ function, which satisfies $-\frac{\pi}2&lt;\theta\le 0$. The tangent function is periodic with period $\pi$, so $\tan(\theta+\pi)=\tan\theta$, and $$\frac{\pi}2=-\frac{\pi}2+\pi&lt;\theta+\pi\le0+\pi=\pi\;,$$ so $\theta+\pi$ is indeed in the second quadrant.</p>

<p>When $z$ is in the third quadrant, you have to find an angle between $-\pi$ and $-\frac{\pi}2$ that has the same tangent as the angle $\theta$ returned by the $\tan^{-1}$ function, which satisfies $0\le\theta&lt;\frac{\pi}2$. This time <strong>subtracting</strong> $\pi$ does the trick: $\tan(\theta-\pi)=\tan\theta$, and</p>

<p>$$-\pi=0-\pi&lt;\theta-\pi&lt;\frac{\pi}2-\pi=-\frac{\pi}2\;.$$</p>

<p>There’s just one slightly tricky bit. If $z$ is a negative real number, should you consider it to be in the second or in the third quadrant? The tangent is $0$, so the $\tan^{-1}$ function will return $0$. If you treat $z$ as being in the second quadrant, you’ll add $\pi$ and get a principal argument of $\pi$. If instead you treat $z$ as being in the third quadrant, you’ll subtract $\pi$ and get a principal argument of $-\pi$. But by definition the principal argument is in the half-open interval $(-\pi,\pi]$, which does not include $-\pi$; thus, you <strong>must</strong> take $z$ to be in the second quadrant and assign it the principal argument $\pi$.</p>

<p>To me that sounds like something that might be better described as a 'target'.</p>

<p>If I take a simple function, say one that only multiplies the input by $2$; and if my limit is $10$ at an input $5$: then I've described something that seems to match the elements contained in Wikipedia's definition.

To make it more calculusy, I could graph the function's output when I use inputs other than $p$, but that really wouldn't give me anything but an illustration of the fact that one's answer moves farther from the right answer as it becomes more wrong (go figure). </p>

","<p>The $p$ value of a test is the probability of seeing a result <em>at least as extreme</em> as the one that you actually saw, assuming the null hypothesis is true.</p>

<p>In your example the null hypothesis is that $\mu=-4$. The standard test here is a two-sided $t$ test, where we first compute the $t$-statistic:</p>

<p>$$t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s / \sqrt{n}}$$</p>

<p>where $\bar{x}$ is the sample mean, $s$ is the sample standard deviation and $n$ is the number of observations in your sample. In your data $\bar{x}=-5.033$, $s=3.567$ and $n=90$, so</p>

<p>$$t = \frac{-5.033 + 4}{3.567/\sqrt{90}} = -2.747$$</p>

<p>This is then compared to a $t$ distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom to calculate a $p$ value. We want the probability that the result is <em>at least as extreme</em> as the one we saw, so we use a two-sided $t$ test, since $t&lt;-2.747$ and $t&gt;2.747$ are both considered equally extreme.</p>

<p>Let $T_{89}$ be a $t$-distributed random variable with 89 degrees of freedom. We have $$P(T_{89} \leq -2.747) = 0.00364$$ and $P(T_{89}\geq2.747)$ will be the same since the $t$ distribution is symmetric, which means that your $p$-value is</p>

<p>$$p = 2 \times 0.00364 = 0.00727$$</p>

<p>so your null hypothesis is rejected at the 1% significance level.</p>

<hr/>

<p>To calculate these $p$ values I used the free software package <a href=""http://www.r-project.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">R</a>, where I simply loaded it up and began typing at the prompt, and it returned a $p$ value:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; pt(-2.747,89)

</code></pre>

<p>If you don't have access to R but you do have access to a distribution table like <a href=""http://www.statsoft.com/textbook/distribution-tables/"" rel=""noreferrer"">this one</a> you could use that. That table only carries degrees of freedom up to 30, and after that it has 'Inf' which represents the normal approximation.</p>

<p>The relevant part of the table for us is</p>

<pre><code>df\p   0.005    0.0005
30     2.750    3.646
Inf    2.579    3.291
</code></pre>

<p>As cardinal says in the comments, with such a large number of degrees of freedom you might think of using the normal approximation, so we look at the 'inf' row. Our $t$ statistic is 2.747, which is</p>

<p>$$\frac{2.747-2.579}{3.291-2.579}=0.236$$</p>

<p>or 23.6% of the way between the entries 2.579 and 3.291. Therefore it's reasonable to think that the $p$ value is 23.6% of the way between 0.005 and 0.0005, which would put it at</p>

<p>$$p \approx 0.005 + (0.0005-0.005)\times 0.236 = 0.00394$$</p>

<p>which we can see is an absolute error of $0.0003$ compared to the true value, and a relative error of $0.00394/0.00364-1 = 0.082$, or about 8.2%.</p>

"Percentage with only standard deviation and mean given.","66937","","<p>I have some questions that I really need help with.</p>

<p>The mean mark for an IQ test in the population is 100, with a standard deviation of 16.5. 
The IQ is normally distributed. Your IQ is 113. </p>

<p>a. What percentage of people will have an IQ higher than your own IQ? </p>

<p>b. What proportion of people will have an IQ between your IQ and the mean IQ mark in 
the population? </p>

<p>c. What decile of the population does your IQ fall into? </p>

<p>How do I even begin? Help me :(</p>
","<p>a) $z=\frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{\sigma}=\frac{113-100}{16.5}\approx 0.7879$. To get what percentage of people scored <em>more</em> than you, take the area from that z-score to infinity (use <code>normalcdf()</code> in your calculator). The area under the curve gives you a percentage (that's how the normal curve works - the entire area is 1 or 100%). The area turns out to be $\approx 0.215384$ and therefore the answer is $\approx 21.5384\%$. You need to do better :).</p>

<p>b) The z-score in the middle is zero. So now take the area from a z-score of $0$ to $0.7879$ (same thing as before). The answer is $\approx 28.4616\%$.</p>

<p>c) This is like asking what percentile you're at. If you are at the 99th percentile, let's say, it means that you are doing better than 99% of the population. In other words, the percentage of people doing worse than you is 99. With relation to the normal curve, this would be the area from $-\infty$ to your z-score. Same exact thing - find the area from $-\infty$ to  $0.7879$. This turns out to be $\approx 78.4616\%$. Now the question asks for your <em>decile</em>, which you may guess from the name is like a percentile except for tens. You're in the 7th decile since you're doing better than about 70% of the population (but not more than 80% of the population).</p>

<p>And just a <strong>tip</strong>: if you have TI-83/84, <code>normalcdf()</code> has two overloaded methods: <code>normalcdf(z_lower, z_upper)</code> (meaning the minimum z-index and the maximum one), or easiest to use is <code>normalcdf(lower, upper, mean, std_dev)</code> (Lower value, upper value, mean, and standard deviation). If you want to put $\infty$, you can use $_\text{E}99$.</p>

"How to tell if a function is one-to-one or onto","66242","","<p>We just learnt this today in Discrete Math, and now I'm trying to review from the textbook. However unfortunately during this lecture I was completely lost with no idea what was going on. </p>

<p>I know that for one-to-one, every $x$ has an unique $y$ and for onto, for all $y$ there exists an $x$ such that $f(x)=y$. </p>

<p>I've provided two questions to use as examples from my textbook. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Suppose $f \colon \Bbb N \to \Bbb N$ has the rule $f(n) = 4n + 1$. Function $f$ is one-to-one.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose $f \colon \Bbb Z \to \Bbb Z$ has the rule $f(n) = 3n - 1$. Function $f$ is onto $\Bbb Z$.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Answer one or both or give a hint, I would just love any explanation to what is going on! Thanks! </p>
","<p>1) Let's show this function is $1-1$. To do this, we suppose $f(n_1) = f(n_2)$ and show that this forces $n_1 = n_2$. </p>

<p>So, if it's true that $f(n_1) = f(n_2)$, then this means that </p>

<p>$$4n_1 + 1 = 4n_2 + 1 \\
\Rightarrow 4n_1 = 4n_2 \\
\Rightarrow n_1 = n_2 $$</p>

<p>and we have demonstrated what is required. Thus, $f$ is $1-1$.</p>

<p>2) Let's see if the function is onto (it might not be). If it is, we should be able to choose <strong>any</strong> $m \in \mathbb{Z}$ and show that there is some $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $f(n) = 3n - 1 = m$.</p>

<p>If this is true, then we will need $n = \dfrac{1}{3}(m + 1)$. The problem is that this might not be an integer! For example, if $m = 1$, then $n$ would need to be $\dfrac{2}{3}$, which is not an integer. Thus, there is no $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $f(n) = 1$ and so the function is <strong>not</strong> onto.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: For fun, let's see if the function in 1) is onto. If so, then for every $m \in \mathbb{N}$, there is $n$ so that $4n + 1 = m$. For basically the same reasons as in part 2), you can argue that this function is <strong>not</strong> onto.</p>

<p>For a more subtle example, let's examine</p>

<p>3) $f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ has the rule $f(n) = n + 2$. If it is onto, then, for every natural number $m$, there is an $n$ such that $n + 2 = m$; i.e. that $n = m - 2$. Now, we don't have the same problem as we did before, that is, we don't have to divide by anything to solve for $n$. Thus there is always an <em>integer</em> $n$ so that $n + 2 = m$.</p>

<p>BUT! If $m = 1$ (for example), then $n$ would have to be $1 - 2 = -1$ which is <strong>not</strong> a natural number, so this function is <strong>not</strong> onto either.</p>

<p>The point of all this is, we have to look closely at both the domain and codomain to answer these kinds of questions.</p>

","<p>If you mean ""<b>normally</b> distributed"", then the distribution of the sample mean is normal with the same expected value as the population mean, namely $12$, and with standard deviation equal to the standard deviation of the population divided by $\sqrt{40}$. Thus it is $4/\sqrt{40}\approx0.6324555\ldots$.  The number $10$ deviates from the expected value by $10-12=-2$.  If you divide that by the standard deviation of the sample mean, you get $-2/0.6324555\ldots\approx-3.1622\ldots$.  That means you're looking at a number about $3.1622$ standard deviations below the mean.  You should have a table giving the probabilty of being below number that's a specified number of standard deviations above or below the mean.</p>

<p>I'm just wondering is there an ""easier"" way to do this (eg. Jacobian determinant when I'm varying all 3 variables). I know you can supposedly visualize a change of area on the surface of the sphere, but I'm not particularly good at doing that sadly.</p>
","<p>I've come across the picture you're looking for in physics textbooks before (say, in classical mechanics).  A bit of googling and I found this one for you!<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3LPIA.jpg"" alt=""area element on sphere""></p>

<p>Alternatively, we can use the first fundamental form to determine the surface area element.  Recall that this is the metric tensor, whose components are obtained by taking the inner product of two tangent vectors on your space, i.e. $g_{i j}= X_i \cdot X_j$ for tangent vectors $X_i, X_j$.  We make the following identification for the components of the metric tensor,
$$
(g_{i j}) = \left(\begin{array}{cc}
		E &amp; F \\
		F &amp; G \end{array} \right),	
$$
so that $E = &lt;X_u, X_u&gt;, F=&lt;X_u,X_v&gt;,$ and $G=&lt;X_v,X_v&gt;.$</p>

<p>We can then make use of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange%27s_identity"" rel=""noreferrer"">Lagrange's Identity</a>, which tells us that the squared area of a parallelogram in space is equal to the sum of the squares of its projections onto the Cartesian plane: $$|X_u \times X_v|^2 = |X_u|^2 |X_v|^2 - (X_u \cdot X_v)^2.$$<br>
Here's a picture in the case of the sphere:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/plSIm.png"" alt=""Projecting surface element onto the Cartesian plane""></p>

<p>This means that our area element is given by 
$$
dA = | X_u \times X_v | du dv = \sqrt{|X_u|^2 |X_v|^2 - (X_u \cdot X_v)^2} du dv = \sqrt{EG - F^2} du dv.
$$</p>

<p>So let's finish your sphere example.  We'll find our tangent vectors via the usual parametrization which you gave, namely, 
$X(\phi,\theta) = (r \cos(\phi)\sin(\theta),r \sin(\phi)\sin(\theta),r \cos(\theta)),$
so that our tangent vectors are simply 
$$
X_{\phi} = (-r\sin(\phi)\cos(\theta),r\cos(\phi)\sin(\theta),0), \\
X_{\theta} = (-r\cos(\phi)\sin(\theta),r\sin(\phi)\cos(\theta),-r\sin(\theta))
$$
Computing the elements of the first fundamental form, we find that 
$$
E = r^2 \sin^2(\theta), \hspace{3mm} F=0, \hspace{3mm} G= r^2.
$$
Thus, we have
$$
dA = \sqrt{r^4 \sin^2(\theta)}d\theta d\phi = r^2\sin(\theta) d\theta d\phi

"Why is the area under a curve the integral?","65727","","<p>I understand how derivatives work based on the definition, and the fact that my professor explained it step by step until the point where I can derive it myself.</p>

<p>However when it comes to the area under a curve for some reason when you break it up into an infinite amount of rectangles, magically it turns into the anti-derivative. Can someone explain why that is the definition of the integral and how Newton figured this out?</p>
","<p>First: the integral is <em>defined</em> to be the (net signed) area under the curve. The definition in terms of Riemann sums is precisely designed to accomplish this. The integral is a limit, a number. There is, a priori, no connection whatsoever with derivatives. (That is one of the things that makes the Fundamental Theorems of Calculus such a potentially surprising things). </p>

<p>Why does the limit of the Riemann sums actually give the area under the graph? The idea of approximating a shape whose area we don't know both from ""above"" and from ""below"" with areas we <em>do</em> know goes all the way back to the Greeks. Archimedes gave bounds for the value of $\pi$ by figuring out areas of inscribed and circumscribed polygons in a circle, knowing that the area of the circle would be somewhere between the two; the more sides to the polygons, the closer the inner and outer polygons are to the circle, the closer the areas are to the area of the circle.</p>

<p>The way Riemann tried to formalize this was with the ""upper"" and ""lower"" Riemann sums: assuming the function is relatively ""nice"", so that on each subinterval it has a maximum and a minimum, the ""lower Riemann sum"" is done by taking the largest ""rectangle"" that will lie completely under the graph by looking at the minimum value of the function on the interval and using that as height; and the ""upper Riemann sum"" is done by taking the smallest rectangle for which the graph will lie completely <em>under</em> it (by taking the maximum value of the function as the height). Certainly, the exact area under the graph on that interval will be somewhere between the two. If we let $\underline{S}(f,P)$ be the lower sum corresponding to some fixed partition $P$ of the interval, and $\overline{S}(f,P)$ be the upper sum, we will have that 
$$\underline{S}(f,P) \leq \int_a^b f(x)\,dx \leq \overline{S}(f,P).$$
(Remember that $\int_a^bf(x)\,dx$ is just the symbol we use to denote the exact (net signed) area under the graph of $f(x)$ between $a$ and $b$, whatever that quantity may be.)</p>

<p>Also, intuitively, the <em>more</em> intervals we take, the closer these two approximations (one from below and one from above) will be. This does not always work out if <em>all</em> we do is take ""more"" intervals. But one thing we <em>can</em> show is that if $P'$ is a <em>refinement</em> of $P$ (it includes all the dividing points that $P$ had, <em>and</em> possibly more points) then
$$\underline{S}(f,P)\leq \underline{S}(f,P')\text{ and } \overline{S}(f,P')\leq \overline{S}(f,P)$$
so at least the approximations are heading in the right direction. To see why this happens, suppose you split one of the subintervals $[t_i,t_{i+1}]$ in two, $[t_i,t']$ and $[t',t_{i+1}]$. The minimum of $f$ on $[t_i,t']$ and on $[t',t_{i+1}]$ are each greater than or equal to the minimum over the whole of $[t_i,t_{i+1}]$, but it may be that the minimum in one of the two bits is actually strictly larger than the minimum over $[t_i,t_{i+1}]$. The areas we get after the split can be no smaller, but they can be larger than the ones we had before the split. Similarly for the upper sums.</p>

<p>So, let's consider one particular sequence of partitions: divide the interval into 2 equal parts; then into 4; then into 8; then into 16; then into 32; and so on; then into $2^n$, etc. If $P_n$ is the partition that divides $[a,b]$ into $2^n$ equal parts, then $P_{n+1}$ is a refinement of $P_n$, and so we have:
$$\underline{S}(f,P_1) \leq\cdots \leq \underline{S}(f,P_n)\leq\cdots \leq\int_a^b f(x)\,dx \leq\cdots \leq\overline{S}(f,P_n)\leq\cdots \leq \overline{S}(f,P_2)\leq\overline{S}(f,P_1).$$</p>

<p>Now, the sequence of numbers $\underline{S}(f,P_1) \leq \underline{S}(f,P_2)\leq\cdots \leq \underline{S}(f,P_n)\leq\cdots$ is increasing and bounded above (by the area). So the numbers have a supremum; call it $\underline{S}$. This number is no more than $\int_a^b f(x)\,dx$. And the numbers $\overline{S}(f,P_1) \geq \overline{S}(f,P_2)\geq\cdots \geq \overline{S}(f,P_n)\geq\cdots$ are decreasing and bounded below, so they have a minimum; call this $\overline{S}$; again, it is no less than $\int_a^bf(x)\,dx$. So we have:
$$\lim_{n\to\infty}\underline{S}(f,P_n) = \underline{S} \leq \int_a^b f(x)\,dx \leq \overline{S} = \lim_{n\to\infty}\overline{S}(f,P_n).$$
What if we are lucky? What if actually we have $\underline{S}=\overline{S}$? Then it <em>must</em> be the case that this common value is the value of $\int_a^b f(x)\,dx$. It just doesn't have a choice! It's definitely trapped between the two, and if there is no space between them, then it's equal to them.</p>

<p>What Riemann proved was several things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If $f$ is ""nice enough"", then you will <em>necessarily</em> get that $\underline{S}=\overline{S}$. In particular, continuous functions happen to be ""nice enough"", so it will definitely work for them (in fact, continuous functions turn out to be ""very nice"", not just ""nice enough""). </p></li>
<li><p>If $f$ is ""nice enough"", then you don't <em>have</em> to use the partitions we used above. You can use <em>any</em> sequence of partitions, so long as the ""mesh size"" (the size of the largest subinterval in the partition) gets smaller and smaller, and has limit of $0$ as $n\to\infty$; if it works for the partitions ""divide-into-$2^n$-equal-intervals"", then it works for <em>any</em> sequence of partitions whose mesh size goes to zero. </p>

<p>So, for example, we can take $P_n$ to be the partition that divides $[a,b]$ into $n$ equal parts, even though $P_{n+1}$ is not a refinement of $P_n$ in this case.</p></li>
<li><p>In fact, you don't have to do $\underline{S}(f,P)$ and $\overline{S}(f,P)$. For the partition $P$, just pick any rectangle that has as its height <em>any</em> value of the function in the subinterval (that is, pick an arbitrary $x_i^*$ in the subinterval $[t_i,t_{i+1}]$, and use $f(x_i^*)$ as the height). Call the resulting sum $S(f,P,x_1^*,\ldots,x_n^*)$. Then you have
$$\underline{S}(f,P) \leq S(f,P,x_1^*,\ldots,x_n^*)\leq \overline{S}(f,P)$$
because $\underline{S}(f,P)$ is computed using the <em>smallest</em> possible values of $f$ throughout, and $\overline{S}(f,P)$ is computed using the <em>largest</em> possible values of $f$ throughout. But since we already know, from 1 and 2 above, that $\underline{S}(f,P)$ and $\overline{S}(f,P)$ have the same limit, then the sums $S(f,P,x_1^*,\ldots,x_n^*)$  <em>also</em> get squeezed and must have <em>that</em> same limit, which equals the integral. </p>

<p>In particular, we can always take the left endpoint (and get a ""Left Hand Sum"") or we can always take the right endpoint (and get a ""Right Hand Sum""), and you will nevertheless get the same limit.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So in summary, you can pick <em>any</em> sequence of partitions, whichever happens to be convenient, so long as the mesh size goes to $0$, and you can pick <em>any</em> points on the subintervals (say, ones which make the calculations simpler) at each stage, and so long as the function is ""nice enough"" (for example, if it is continuous), everything will work out and the limit will be the number which <em>must</em> be the value of the area (because it was trapped between the lower and upper sums, and they both got squeezed together trapping the limit and the integral both between them). </p>

<p>Now, (1) and (2) above are the hardest part of what Riemann did. Don't be surprised if it sounds a bit magical at this point. But I hope that you agree that <em>if</em> the lower and upper sums for the special partitions have the same limits then that limit <em>must be</em> the area that lies under the graph. </p>

<p>Thanks to that work of Riemann, then (at least for continuous functions) we can <em>define</em> $\int_a^b f(x)\,dx$ to be the limit of, say, the left hand sums of the partitions we get by dividing $[a,b]$ into $n$ equal parts, because these partitions have mesh size going to $0$, we can pick any points we like (say, the left end points), and we know the limit is going to be that common value of $\underline{S}$ and $\overline{S}$, which <em>has</em> to be the area. So that, under this definition, $\int_a^b f(x)\,dx$ really <em>is</em> the net signed area under the graph of $f(x)$. It just doesn't have a choice but to be that, when $f$ is ""nice enough"". </p>

<hr/>

<p>Second, the area does <em>not</em> turn into ""the"" antiderivative. What happens is that it turns out (perhaps somewhat magically) that the area can be <em>computed</em> using <em>an</em> antiderivative. I'll go into some more details below.</p>

<p>As to how Newton figured this out, <em>his</em> teacher, Isaac Barrow, was the one who discovered there was a connection between derivatives and tangents; some of the basic ideas were his. They came from studying some simple functions and some simple formulas for tangents he had discovered.</p>

<p>For example, the tangents to the parabola $y=x^2$ were interesting (there was generally geometric interest in tangents and in ""squaring"" regions, also known as finding the ""quadrature"" of a region, that is, finding a way to construct a square or rectangle that had the same area as the region you were considering), and led to associating the parabola $y=x^2$ to lines of the form $y=2x$. It does not take too much experimentation to realize that if you look at the area under $y=2x$ from 0 to a, you end up with $a^2$, establishing a connection. Barrow did this with arguments with infinitesimals (which were a bit fuzzy and not set on entirely correct  and solid logical foundation until well into the 20th century), which were generally laborious, and only for <em>some</em> curves. When Newton extended Barrow's methods to more general curves and tangents, he also extended the discovery of the connection with areas, and was able to prove what is essentially the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.</p>

<p>Now, here is one way to approach the connection. We want to figure out the value of, say, 
$$\int_0^a f(x)\,dx$$
for some $a$. This can be done using limits and Riemann sums (Newton and Leibniz had similar methods, though not set up quite as precisely as Riemann sums are). But here is an absolutely crazy suggestion: suppose you can find a ""master function"" $\mathcal{M}$, which, when given <em>any</em> point $b$ between $0$ and $a$, will give you the value of $\int_0^b f(x)\,dx$. If you have such a master function, then you can use it to find the value of the integral you want just by taking $\mathcal{M}(a)$!</p>

<p>In fact, this is the approach Barrow had taken: his great insight was that instead of trying to find the quadrature a particular area, he was trying to solve the problem of squaring several different (but related) areas at the same time. So he was looking for, for instance, a ""master function"" for the region was like a triangle except that the top was a parabola instead of a line (like the area from $0$ to $a$ under $y=x^2$), and so on. </p>

<p>On its face, this is a completely ludicrous suggestion. It's like telling someone who is trying to know how to get from building A to building B that if he only memorizes the map for the entire city <em>first</em>, then he can use that knowledge to figure out how to get form A to B. If we are having trouble finding the integral $\int_0^a f(x)\,dx$, then the ""master function"" seems to require us to find not just <em>that</em> area, but also <em>all</em> areas in between! It's like telling someone who is having trouble walking that he should just run very slowly when he wants to walk.</p>

<p>But, again, the interesting thing is that even though we may not be able to say what the ""master function"" <em>is</em>, we <em>can</em> say how it changes as b changes (remember, $\mathcal{M}(b) = \int_0^b f(x)\,dx$ is a number that depends on $b$, so $\mathcal{M}$ is a function of $b$). Because figuring out how functions change is easier than computing their values (just think about derivatives, and how we can easily figure out the rate of change of $\sin(x)$, but we have a hard time actually <em>computing</em> specific values of $\sin(x)$ that are not among some very simple ones). (This is also something Barrow already knew, as did Newton).</p>

<p>For ""nice functions"" (if $f$ is <em>continuous</em> on an interval that contains $0$ and $a$), we can do it using limits and some theorems about ""nice"" functions:
Using limits, we have:
\begin{align}
\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{\mathcal{M}(b+h)-\mathcal{M}}{h} &amp;= \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{1}{h}\left(\int_0^{b+h}f(x)\,dx - \int_0^bf(x)\,dx\right)\\\
&amp;= \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{1}{h}\int_b^{b+h}f(x)\,dx.
\end{align}
Since we are assuming that $f$ is continuous on $[0,a]$, it is continuous on the interval with endpoints $b$ and $b+h$ (I say it this way because $h$ could be negative). So it has a maximum and a minimum (continuous function on a finite closed interval). Say the maximum is $M(h)$ and the minimum is $m(h)$. Then $m(h) \leq f(x) \leq M(h)$ for all $x$ in the interval, so we know, since the integral <em>is</em> the area, that
$$hm(h) \leq \int_b^{b+h}f(x)\,dx \leq hM(h).$$
That means that
$$m(h) \leq \frac{1}{h}\int_b^{b+h}f(x)\,dx \leq M(h)\text{ if $h\gt 0$}$$
and
$$ M(h) \leq \frac{1}{h}\int_b^{b+h}f(x)\,dx \leq m(h)\text{ if $h\lt 0$.}$$</p>

<p>As $h\to 0$, the interval gets smaller, the difference between the minimum and maximum value gets smaller. One can prove that both $M$ and $m$ are continuous functions, and that $m(h)\to f(b)$ as $h\to 0$, and likewise that $M(h)\to f(b)$ as $h\to 0$. So we can use the Squeeze Theorem to conclude that since the limit of $\frac{1}{h}\int_b^{b+h}f(x)\,dx$ is squeezed between two functions that both have the same limit as $h\to 0$, then $\frac{1}{h}\int_b^{b+h}f(x)\,dx$ also has a limit as $h\to 0$ and is in fact that same quantity, namely $f(b)$. That is
$$\frac{d}{db}\mathcal{M}(b) = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{\mathcal{M}(b+h)-\mathcal{M}(b)}{h} = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{1}{h}\int_{b}^{b+h}f(x)\,dx = f(b).$$</p>

<p>That is: when $f$ is continuous, the ""Master function"" for areas turns out to have a rate of change equal to $f$. This is not that crazy, if you think about it: how is the area under $y=f(x)$ from $x=0$ to $x=b$ changing? Well, it's changing by whatever $f$ is. </p>

<p>This means that, whatever the ""Master function"" turns out to be, it will be an antiderivative of $f(x)$.</p>

<p>We also know, because we are very good with derivatives, that if $\mathcal{F}(x)$ and $\mathcal{G}(x)$ are two functions, and $\mathcal{F}'(x) = \mathcal{G}'(x)$ for all $x$, then $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{G}$ differ by a constant: there exists a constant $k$ such that $\mathcal{F}(x) = \mathcal{G}(x)+k$ for all $x$.</p>

<p>So, we know that the ""Master function"" is <em>an</em> antiderivative. If, by some sheer stroke of luck, we happen to find <em>any</em> antiderivative $F(x)$ for $f(x)$, then we know that the only possible difference between $\mathcal{M}(b)$ and $F(b)$ is a constant. What constant? Well, luckily we know <em>one</em> value of $\mathcal{M}(b)$: we know that $\mathcal{M}(0) = \int_0^0f(x)\,dx$ <em>should</em> be $0$.  So, $M(0) = 0 = F(0)-F(0)$, which means the constant has to be $-F(0)$. That is, we must have $M(b) = F(b)-F(0)$ for all $b$. </p>

<p>So, if we find <em>any</em> antiderivative $F$ of $f$, then $\mathcal{M}(b) = F(b)-F(0)$ is in fact the ""Master function"" we were looking for, the one that gives <em>all</em> the integrals between $0$ and $a$, including $0$ and including $a$. So that we have that two very different processes (computing areas using limits of Riemann sums, and derivatives) are connected: if $f(x)$ is continuous, and $F(x)$ is <em>any</em> antiderivative for $f(x)$ on $[0,a]$, then
$$\int_0^a f(x)\,dx = \mathcal{M}(a) = F(a)-F(0).$$</p>

<p>But the integral did not ""magically turn"" into an antiderivative. It's that the ""Master function"" which can be used to keep track of <em>all</em> integrals of $f(x)$ has rate of change equal to $f$, which gives us a ""back door"" to computing integrals. </p>

<p>Newton was able to prove this because he had the guide of Barrow's insight that this was happening for the functions he worked with. Barrow's insight was achieved because he had the brilliant idea of trying to come up with a ""Master function"" instead of trying to rectify lots of different areas one at a time, and he noticed the connection because he had already worked with tangents/derivatives for those functions. Leibniz likewise had access to Barrow's ideas, so the connection between the two was also known to him.</p>

","<p>I have noticed that the answer has been written down in the comments. Just to have an answer I am writing this one down.</p>

<p>Consider $\|u+v\|^2=(u+v) \cdot (u+v)$ where $u \cdot v$ represents the standard inner product/scalar product.Therefore $$\|u+v\|^2=\|u\|^2+2 (u \cdot v) + \|v\|^2 .$$</p>

"Find the Vector Equation of a line perpendicular to the plane.","63807","","<p>Question: Find the vector equation $r(t)$ for the line through the point $P = (-1, -5, 2)$ that is perpendicular to the plane $1 x  - 5 y + 1 z = 1$.
Use $t$ as your variable, $t = 0$ should correspond to $P$, and the velocity vector of the line should be the same as the standard normal vector of the plane.</p>

<p>This one is really giving me a hard time.  I know that to find the plane perpendicular to the line I can use the vector n between two points on the line and and the plane.  I cannot wrap my mind around how to reverse this process, particularly because the plane is equal to 1 and not zero.</p>

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
","<p>The vector equation for any line is </p>

<p>$$r(t) = \text{point you want it to pass through} + \text{parameter} \cdot \text{velocity vector}.$$</p>

<p>You want it to pass through the point $P = (-1,-5,2)$ and uses the parameter $t$, so we write</p>

<p>$$r(t) = (-1,-5,2) + t \cdot \text{velocity vector}.$$</p>

<p>As it asked to set the velocity vector as the normal vector to the plane, and that is $N = (1,-5,1)$, we get</p>

<p>$$r(t) = (-1,-5,2) + t (1,5,1).$$</p>

<p>The parameter could have been anything else. We could have chosen $2t, t/7$ or $4t-3$. What difference does it make? </p>

<p>In the first two cases we are changing the speed at which the point walks the line. With $2t$ it walks twice as faster, with $t/7$ it walks $1/7$ slower. </p>

<p>The case $(4t-3)$ changes both speed and at what time you pass through the desired point. With $(4t-3)$ you'll pass through point $P$ at the time $t=3/4$. Using the parameter $t$ ensures that at time $t=0$, so to speak, you begin at point $(-1,-5,2)$. </p>

<p>Could anyone give me a simple example of what calculations I need to perform?</p>
","<p>I will consolidate my comments here.</p>

<p>Since the standard deviation ($\sigma$) is calculated from the mean of the data, usually the three sigma rule is also based on the mean of the data.</p>

<p>From the data given, the mean is $\dfrac{.49+.41}{2}=.45$.</p>

<p>The standard deviation would be $\sigma=\sqrt{\dfrac{(.49-.45)^2+(.41-.45)^2}{2}}=.04$.</p>

<p>If there is different mean, there must be other data, which might mean a different $\sigma$. Otherwise, you can compute the distance between the two samples in terms of their standard deviation using their difference ($.49-.41$) the value if $\sigma$ computed above.</p>

"a probability question using percentages","63212","","<p>This question is confusing me as I am not used to seeing percentages in a possibility question.</p>

<pre><code>in a large insurance agency

- 40% of the customers have homeowners insurance
- 75% of the customers have on type or the other or both

a) find the proportion of customers with both types of insurance.
b) find the probability that a customer has homeowner insurance 
   given that he has automobile insurance
c) find the probability that a customer has automobile insurance given that 
   he has home insurance 
</code></pre>

<p>I am not asking for someone to solve this, I am just wondering if it would be the same logic as a normal ""rolling the dice n times question""?</p>

<p>so far I have thought of this :<br>
$P(A) = \frac{6}{10}$ customers have auto insurance<br>
$P(B) = \frac{4}{10}$ have homeowner insurance<br>
$P(C) = \frac{7.5}{10}$ have one type or the other or both  </p>

<p>a) so we have to do $A \land B$ and since they are independent events we can just multiply $P(A) \times P(B)$ :  $$(6/10) * (4/10) = 24/100$$</p>

<p>b) $$P(B|A) = P(B \land A)/P(A) = (24/100)/6/10 = 4/10$$</p>

<p>now thats as far as I have done but I started thinking that I did not use $C$ at all so I think I am doing something wrong and I should take $C$ into account but not sure how. could some one tell me if I am doing anything wrong.</p>
","<p>You need to use the following formula, which is undoubtedly part of your course material:
$$P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B). \qquad(\ast)$$</p>

<p>At least informally, this is fairly easy to see by drawing a diagram. Draw two intersecting circles, and label them $A$ and $B$. The probability of $A\cup B$ is kind of the weight of $A\cup B$. If we add $P(A)$ and $P(B)$, we have counted the probability of $A\cap B$ twice, so we must subtract it.</p>

<p>Let $A$ be the event ""has auto insurance"" and let $B$ be the event ""has home insurance.""</p>

<p>For Question a), we want $P(A\cap B)$. Using the formula $(\ast)$, we find that $0.75=0.60+0.40-P(A\cap B)$, and therefore $P(A\cap B)=0.25$.</p>

<p>For Question b), you want $P(B|A)$.  Here you use the fact that 
$$P(A\cap B)=P(B|A)P(A).$$
From a), you know $P(A\cap B)$. And you certainly know $P(A)$. Now you can find $P(B|A)$. </p>

<p>Question c) is answered very much like Question b).</p>

<p><strong>Remark:</strong> Note that $A$ and $B$ are <strong>not</strong> independent. If they were, we would have $P(A\cap B)=P(A)P(B)$. But we saw that $P(A\cap B)=0.25$.  Note that $P(A)P(B)=0.24$. Not equal!</p>

<p>However, interestingly enough, the two numbers $0.25$ and $0.24$ are quite close to each other. Informally, although $A$ and $B$ are not independent, they are fairly close to being independent.  </p>

"Probability of of an event happening at least once in a sequence of independent events?","62725","","<p>I want to find the probability of flipping heads at least once if you flip a coin two times. The possible outcomes (we don't care about the order) are (each equally likely)  TT, TH, HT, HH. Three out of four have an H in them, so the probability is $\large \frac 34$. Is this correct? Is there a better and efficient way (especially when dealing with a higher number of flips? Please use only very basic terminology and concepts from probability because I've never taken a class. Thanks.</p>
","<p>We have the following equally likely outcomes:</p>

<p><code>T T</code> <br>
<code>T H</code> &lt;-- <br>
<code>H T</code> &lt;--<br>
<code>H H</code> &lt;--<br></p>

<p>In three of the four outcomes, a Heads appears: Probability of at least one head is indeed $\dfrac 34$. Put differently, note that the probability that <strong>no</strong> heads appears is 1 out of four or $\frac 14$. So the probability of at least one head is $1$ minus the probability of getting NO heads, which is $1$ minus the probability of getting all tails: is $1 - \frac 14 = 1 - \frac{1}{2^2} = 1 - \frac 12 \cdot \frac 12$</p>

<p>In the above demonstration, it is quite easy to list out the ""probability space"": which is essentially, all possible outcomes.</p>

<p>The ""<strong>at least one</strong> head"" qualifier is handy, because it allows you to simplify the determination of probability for any arbitrarily large numbers of flips.</p>

<p>If you flip a coin $n$ times, and want to know the probability of getting at least <em>one</em> head, note the outcome of getting <strong>all tails</strong> is the ""complement"" of the set of outcomes in which you get at least one head. The probability of getting <strong>all/only</strong> tails, when flipping a coin $n$ times is equal to $$\underbrace{\dfrac 12 \cdot \frac 12 \cdot \cdots \cdot \frac 12}_{\large n\; \text{times}} = \left(\frac 1{2}\right)^n$$</p>

<p>What is the velocity of the ball when it hit's the ground (Height 0)?</p>
","<p>Due to symmetry (you can verify this with calculation), the ball will be moving 80 ft/sec when it comes back down to the point from which you threw it on the building. So you can reduce the problem to describing a ball thrown off a building with initial velocity 80 ft/sec downward. We have</p>

<p>$$
s(t) = 32 - 80 t - 16 t^2,
$$</p>

t = \frac{80 \pm \sqrt{80^2+4(16)(32)}}{-32},
$$</p>

Would  some of my buddies just interrupt me and say: Stop! You are not cutting the cake in a fair manner! My hands started shaking in fear of that. But, no, nothing happened. Fortunately.</p>
","<p>Just for the record, here's the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Selfridge-Conway_discrete_procedure"">Selfridge–Conway discrete procedure</a> mentioned in the comments. The Wikipedia article also contains some commentary on its origin and why it works.</p>

<p>This procedure was the first envy-free discrete procedure devised for three players. The maximal number of cuts in the procedure is five. The pieces are not always contiguous. Solutions for n players were also found later.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose we have three players P1, P2 and P3. Where the procedure gives a criterion for a decision it means that criterion gives an
  optimum choice for the player.</p>
  
  <p>Step 1. P1 divides the cake into three pieces he considers of equal size.</p>
  
  <p>Step 2. Let's call A the largest piece according to P2.</p>
  
  <p>Step 3. P2 cuts off a bit of A to make it the same size as the second largest. Now A is divided into: </p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>the trimmed piece A1 </li>
  <li>the trimmings A2. </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Leave the trimmings A2 to one side. If P2 thinks that the two largest parts are equal, then each player chooses a part in this
  order: P3, P2 and finally P1.</p>
  
  <p>Step 4. P3 chooses a piece among A1 and the two other pieces.</p>
  
  <p>Step 5. P2 chooses a piece with the limitation that if P3 didn't choose A1, P2 must choose it.</p>
  
  <p>Step 6. P1 chooses the last piece leaving just the trimmings A2 to be divided.</p>
  
  <p>Now, the cake minus the trimmings A2 has been divided in an envy free manner. The trimmed piece A1 has been chosen by either P2 or P3.
  Let's call the player who chose it  PA and the other one Player PB. </p>
  
  <p>Step 7. PB cuts A2 into three equal pieces.</p>
  
  <p>Step 8. PA chooses a piece of A2 - we name it A2<sub>1</sub>.</p>
  
  <p>Step 9. P1 chooses a piece of A2 - we name it A2<sub>2</sub>.</p>
  
  <p>Step 10. PB chooses the last remaining piece of A2 - we name it A2<sub>3</sub>.</p>

  <p>This procedure is named after <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Selfridge"">John Selfridge</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway"">John Horton Conway</a>.
  Selfridge discovered it in 1960, and told it to Richard Guy, who told

"Why the sum of residuals equals 0 when we do a sample regression by OLS?","61779","","<p>That's my question, I have looking round online and people post a formula by they don't explain the formula. Could anyone please give me a hand with that ? cheers</p>
","<p>If the OLS regression contains a constant term, i.e. if in the regressor matrix there is a regressor of a series of ones, then the sum of residuals is <em>exactly</em> equal to zero, as a matter of algebra.</p>

<p><strong>For the simple regression,</strong><br>
specify the regression model
$$y_i = a +bx_i + u_i\,,\; i=1,...,n$$</p>

<p>Then the OLS estimator $(\hat a, \hat b)$ minimizes the sum of squared residuals, i.e.</p>

<p>$$(\hat a, \hat b) : \sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \hat a - \hat bx_i)^2 = \min$$</p>

<p>For the OLS estimator to be the <em>argmin</em> of the objective function, it must be the case as a necessary condition, that the first partial derivatives with respect to $a$ and $b$, evaluated at $(\hat a, \hat b)$ equal zero.  For our result, we need only consider the partial w.r.t. $a$:</p>

<p>$$\frac {\partial}{\partial a} \sum_{i=1}^n(y_i -  a - bx_i)^2 \Big |_{(\hat a, \hat b)} = 0 \Rightarrow -2\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i -  \hat a - \hat bx_i) = 0 $$</p>

<p>But $y_i -  \hat a - \hat bx_i = \hat u_i$, i.e. is equal to the residual, so we have that </p>

<p>$$\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i -  \hat a - \hat bx_i) = \sum_{i=1}^n\hat u_i = 0 $$</p>

<p>The above also implies that if the regression specification does <em>not</em> include a constant term, then the sum of residuals will not, in general, be zero.</p>

<p><strong>For the multiple regression,</strong><br>
let $\mathbf X$ be the $n \times k$ matrix containing the regressors, $\hat {\mathbf u}$ the residual vector and $\mathbf y$ the dependent variable vector. Let $\mathbf M  = I_n-\mathbf X(\mathbf X'\mathbf X)^{-1}\mathbf X'$ be the ""residual-maker"" matrix, called thus because we have</p>

<p>$$\hat {\mathbf u} = \mathbf M\mathbf y$$</p>

<p>It is easily verified that $\mathbf M \mathbf X = \mathbf 0$. Also $\mathbf M$ is idempotent and symmetric.</p>

<p>Now, let $\mathbf i$ be a column vector of ones. Then the sum of residuals is</p>

<p>$$\sum_{i=1}^n \hat u_i = \mathbf i'\hat {\mathbf u} =\mathbf i'\mathbf M\mathbf y = \mathbf i'\mathbf M'\mathbf y = (\mathbf M\mathbf i)'\mathbf y = \mathbf 0' \mathbf y = \mathbf 0$$</p>

<p>So we need the regressor matrix to contain a series of ones, so that we get $\mathbf M\mathbf i = \mathbf 0$.</p>

<p>I'm getting back into calculus and very rusty. I'd like to be comfortable with some of the proofs behind various fundamental ""Table of Integrals"" integrals.</p>

<p>Looking at it, the substitution rule seems like the method of choice. What is the strategy here for choosing a substitution? It has a form similar to many trigonometric integrals, but the final result seems to suggest that they're not necessary in this case.</p>
","<p>A trigonometric substitution does indeed work. </p>

<p>We want to express $(a^2 + u^2)^{3/2}$ as something without square roots. We want to use some form of the Pythagorean trigonometric identity $\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1$. Multiplying each side by $\frac{a^2}{\cos^2 x}$, we get $a^2 \tan^2 x + a^2 = a^2 \sec^2 x$, which is in the desired form. of (sum of two squares) = (something squared).</p>

<p>This suggests that we should use the substitution $u^2 = a^2 \tan^2 x$. Equivalently, we substitute $u = a \tan x$ and $du = a \sec^2 x dx$. Then
$$
\int \frac{du}{(a^2 + u^2)^{3/2}} 
= \int \frac{a \sec^2 x \, dx}{(a^2 + a^2 \tan^2 x)^{3/2}}.
$$
Applying the trigonometric identity considered above, this becomes
$$
\int \frac{a \sec^2 x \, dx}{(a^2 \sec^2 x)^{3/2}}
= \int \frac{dx}{a^2 \sec x} = \frac{1}{a^2} \int \cos x \, dx,
$$
which can be easily integrated as
$$
=\frac{1}{a^2} \sin x.
$$
Since we set $u = a \tan x$, we substitute back $x = \tan^{-1} (\frac ua)$ to get that the answer is
$$
=\frac{1}{a^2} \sin \tan^{-1} \frac{u}{a}.
$$
Since $\sin \tan^{-1} z = \frac{z}{\sqrt{z^2 + 1}}$, this yields the desired result of 
$$
=\frac{u/a}{a^2 \sqrt{(u/a)^2 + 1}}
= \frac{u}{a^2 (a^2 + u^2)^{1/2}}.

<p>What's the inverse operation of exponents (exponents: 3^5)</p>
","<p>These functions are the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>logarithms</strong></a>, and they turn out to be fundamentally important. For $a = b^c$ (where $b &gt; 0$) we write:
$$c = \log_b a,$$
which we can take to be the definition of $\log_b$. We read the operation as ""logarithm, base $b$,"" or ""base $b$ logarithm"".</p>

<p>In particular, we have $$\log_a (a^b) = b \qquad\text{and}\qquad a^{\log_a b} = b.$$ Of special interest is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_logarithm"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>natural logarithm</strong></a>, denoted by $\ln$ or $\log$, which has base $e$. (NB that sometimes $\log$ can also denote base $10$, or base $2$, depending on context.)</p>

<p>Logarithm identities correspond to exponential identities. From example, from the definition we can conclude that $$\log_b (pq) = \log_b p + \log_b q$$ (for $p, q &gt; 0$), which corresponds to the identity $b^{pq} = b^p b^q$.</p>

<p>Perhaps counterintuitively, sometimes it is convenient to define logarithms first and then define exponents as inverses of logarithms, which leads to the slightly antiquated name <em>antilog</em> for an exponential function $x \mapsto b^x$.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> Some of the other answers here pointed out quite rightly that one can also ask about the inverse of functions where the variable is in the base, i.e., functions $x \mapsto x^a$, and inverse of these functions (at least when $a &gt; 0$) are the just the functions $x \mapsto x^{1/a}$, which we often write as $\sqrt[a]{x}$. These functions are called <strong>power functions</strong> (note that the inverse of a power function is again a power function), and we reserve the name <strong>exponential function</strong> for functions $x \mapsto b^x$ where the variable is in the exponent, i.e., those to which the logarithms are inverses.</p>

  <p>$\frac{1}{7}$ </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have no idea, Can you please explain?</p>

<p>thanks! Appraciate it!</p>
","<p>A fair coin has etqual probabilitiers for heads and tails. Therefore the probability can simply be found by counting.</p>

<p>There are eight different possibilities for outcomes of three tosses:</p>

<ol>
<li>Head, Head, Head</li>
<li>Head, Head, Tail</li>
<li>Head, Tail, Head</li>
<li>Head, Tail, Tail</li>
<li>Tail, Head, Head</li>
<li>Tail, Head, Tail</li>
<li>Tail, Tail, Head</li>
<li>Tail, Tail, Tail</li>
</ol>

<p>Possibilities 1 to 7 have at least 1 head, while possibility 8 doesn't. Therefore remove that last one.</p>

<p>From the 7 remaining possibilities, 1 has all three heads, so the probability is one out of seven, or $\frac17$.</p>

<p>OK, but what to do if there are too many cases to explicitly list them? Well, it is easy to see that you cannot have three heads without having at least one head. So your probability is
$$p_{\text{3 heads if at least 1 head}} = \frac{\text{Number of cases with 3 heads}}{\text{Number of cases with at least 1 head}}$$
However you know that
$$p_{\text{3 heads}} = \frac{\text{Number of cases with 3 heads}}{\text{Number of all cases}}$$
and
$$p_{\text{at least 1 head}} = \frac{\text{Number of cases with at least 1 head}}{\text{Number of all cases}}$$
From this, it is not hard to see that
$$p_{\text{3 heads if at least 1 head}} =\frac{p_{\text{3 heads}}}{p_{\text{at least 1 head}}}$$
Now you surely know that $p_{\text{3 heads}}=\left(\frac12\right)^3=\frac18$ and $p_{\text{at least 1 head}} = 1-p_{\text{3 tails}}=\frac78$. Inserting then again gives $p_{\text{3 heads if at least 1 head}}=\frac18/\frac78=\frac17$.</p>

<p>Indeed, that latter formula works even for arbitrary probabilities (i.e. not only fair coins). Note however that it still depends on the fact that having 3 heads implies having at least 1 head.</p>

What should be the maximum error accepted with the probability of 0.90?
[Result is 8.225 millimetre]</p>

<p>How will I calculate it?
How to integrate:  $\exp\left(- \frac{x^2}{2} \right)$  ?  </p>
","<p>There are several methods to approach this, but I am going to use one that meets your requirement (clarified in a comment) that one must forego the use of computational engines like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematica"">Mathematica</a>, instead opting for a calculator. Additionally, I feel that using a table of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"">normal distribution</a> values is cheating, so I will be foregoing their use as well.</p>

<p>First, we need the equation for $\mathcal{N}(0,25)$, which, by definition, is:
\begin{align*}
f(x) &amp;= \mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma ^2)\\
&amp;= \mathcal{N}(0,25)\\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\,e^{ -\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2} }\\
&amp;= \frac{1}{5 \sqrt{2 \pi }}\,e^{-\frac{x^2}{50}}
\end{align*}
Now, we simply need to integrate this from $-x$ to $x$, set it equal to $.90$, and solve for $x$ (our answer):
$$F(x) = \frac{1}{5 \sqrt{2 \pi }}\int_{-x}^x e^{-\frac{x^2}{50}} \,\mathrm{d}x=0.9$$
However, we run into problems when we realize that this isn't a simple integral to take!
Since we already know the answer, we can actually exploit this to our advantage by finding an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_function"">elementary function</a> that estimates $F(x)$ with an adequately small margin of error after the integral. One simple function you can use to estimate $F(x)$ is a Taylor series.</p>

<p>We first need to find a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series"">Taylor series</a> for $f(x)$ using the formula for a Taylor series:
$$\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty } \frac {f^{(n)}(a)}{n!} \, (x-a)^{n}$$
One can easily recognize the pattern for our function when $a=0$ (the center of our bell curve) to generate this series:
$$f(x) = \frac{1}{5 \sqrt{2 \pi}}\sum\limits_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^k x^{2k}}{50^k k!}$$
We can now trivially take the integral of this series where we otherwise wouldn't have been able to:
$$F(x) = \frac{1}{5 \sqrt{2 \pi}}\sum\limits_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^k x^{2 k+1}}{50^k k! (2 k+1)}$$
Since we can't use our pencil and paper to evaluate the series all the way to infinity, we need to figure out how many terms we need to go out to get an acceptably accurate answer. This can be accomplished by figuring out the error caused by not going out to infinity before we actually solve the equation. By plugging in our already-known value of $8.225$ for $x$ in the $k$<sup>th</sup> term of the series and evaluating just the series part from $k$ to $\infty$, we get the error that the series will have from $0$ to $k-1$. Since we, again, can't go all the way out to infinity, we can get a slight, but adequate, underestimate of the error by simply evaluating the series from $k$ to $k$ since each subsequent term in the series is substantially smaller.</p>

<p>I started by plugging in $8.225$ for $x$ when $k=7$ and got this (do this on your calculator):
$$\sum\limits_{k=7}^{7 } \frac{(-1)^k (8.225)^{2 k+1}}{50^k k! (2 k+1)} = -\frac{(8.225)^{15}}{59062500000000000} \approx -0.000903081$$
Since our integrated series is the equivalent of $F$ in $F(x) - F(-x) = \int_{-x}^x f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x$ where $f(x)$ is the equation for $\mathcal{N}(0,25)$, we need to multiply our answer by $2$ to get a rough estimate of the error our final answer will have: $-0.000903081 \times 2 = -0.001806162$.</p>

<p>Since we are looking for a three decimal accuracy, we should proceed and try the series when $k=8$:
$$\sum\limits_{k=8}^{8 } \frac{(-1)^k (8.225)^{2 k+1}}{50^k k! (2 k+1)} = \frac{(8.225)^{17}}{26775000000000000000} \approx 0.000134766$$
Finally, $0.000134766 \times 2 = 0.000269532$. This is of adequate accuracy for our final calculation; since the error calculated when $k=8$ is acceptable, we will evaluate the terms of the series from $k=0$ to $7$ ($k$ used in error calculation minus $1$):
$$F(x) \approx \frac{1}{5 \sqrt{2 \pi}}\sum\limits_{k=0}^{7} \frac{(-1)^k x^{2 k+1}}{50^k k! (2 k+1)}$$
This comes out to be:
$$\frac{x-\frac{x^3}{150}+\frac{x^5}{25000}-\frac{x^7}{5250000}+\frac{x^9}{1350000000}-\frac{x^{11}}{412500000000}+\frac{x^{13}}{146250000000000}-\frac{x^{15}}{59062500000000000}}{5 \sqrt{2 \pi }}$$
Since this is our estimate of $F(x)$, and this is an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odd_function#Odd_functions"">odd function</a> (a function is odd if $-f(x) = f(-x)$), we simply need to multiply this function by $2$ to get $F(x) - F(-x)$ (what we need to set to $0.90$ and solve):
$$\frac{1}{5} \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} (x-\frac{x^3}{150}+\frac{x^5}{25000}-\frac{x^7}{5250000}+\frac{x^9}{1350000000}-\frac{x^{11}}{412500000000}+\frac{x^{13}}{146250000000000}-\frac{x^{15}}{59062500000000000})$$</p>

<p>Now, by setting this equal to $.90$, rearranging the equation as a polynomial, and using a method of our choice to solve polynomials on a calculator (like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method"">Newton's method</a> to converge on the answer), we find that the relevant solution is:

That allows you to eliminate $x^2$ in favour of $2rh-h^2$, so you have $V(h)=\frac13(2rh-h^2)h$ and thus $V'(h)=\frac13(4rh-3h^2)$, which vanishes at $h=\frac43r$ and thus $x=\frac{\sqrt8}3r$, with maximal volume $V=\frac13\pi\frac89r^2\frac43r=\frac{32}{81}\pi r^3=\frac8{27}V_\text s$, where $V_\text s$ is the volume of the sphere.</p>

$x=\sinh t$ and $dx=\cosh t\, dt$ which gives
$$\int \frac{\cosh t}{\cosh t} \, dt = \int 1\, dt=t=\operatorname{argsinh} x = \ln (x+\sqrt{x^2+1})+C,$$

<p>I once read that some mathematicians provided a very length proof of $1+1=2$.</p>

<p>Can you think of some way to extend mathematical rigor to present a long proof of that equation? I'm not asking for a proof, but rather for some outline what one would consider to make the derivation as long as possible.</p>

<p>EDIT: It seems the proof I heard about is a standard reference given here multiple times :) I stated that the proof itself is less useful than an outline for me as I know only ""physics level maths"". Can someone provide a short outline what's going on in the proof? Some outline I can look up section by section in Wikipedia to at least get a feel of what could be needed to make such a proof?</p>
","<p>You are thinking of the <em><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Mathematica"">Principia Mathematica</a></em>, written by Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell. Here is a relevant excerpt:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/cZyOW.jpg"" alt=""Principia Mathematica *54.43""></p>

<p>As you can see, it ends with ""From this proposition it will follow, when arithmetical addition has been defined, that 1+1=2."" The theorem above, $\ast54\cdot43$, is already a couple of hundred pages into the book (Wikipedia says 370 or so); the later theorem alluded to, that $1+1=2$, appears in section $\ast102$, considerably farther on.</p>

<p>I wrote a <a href=""http://blog.plover.com/math/PM.html"">blog article</a> a few years ago that discusses this in some detail. You may want to skip the stuff at the beginning about the historical context of <em>Principia Mathematica</em>. But the main point of the article is to explain the theorem above.</p>

<p>The article explains the idiosyncratic and mostly obsolete notation that <em>Principia Mathematica</em> uses, and how the proof works.  The theorem here is essentially that if $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are disjoint sets with exactly one element each, then their union has exactly two elements.  This is  established based on very slightly simpler theorems, for example that if $\alpha$ is the set that contains $x$ and nothing else, and $\beta$ is the set that contains $y$ and nothing else, then $\alpha \cup \beta$ contains two elements if and only if $x\ne y$.</p>

<p>The main reason that it takes so long to get to $1+1=2$ is that <em>Principia Mathematica</em> starts from almost nothing, and works its way up in very tiny, incremental steps. The work of G. Peano shows that it's not hard to produce a useful set of axioms that can prove 1+1=2 much more easily than Whitehead and Russell do. </p>

<p>It would not be hard to copy-and-paste the relevant parts of the blog article here, but I am not sure if that is appropriate se.math etiquette; I invite comments on this matter.</p>

<p>$1225 = 5^2 \cdot 7^2$, therefore the sum of factors is $ (1+5+25)(1+7+49)  = 1767$</p>

"Deriving demand functions given utility","59464","","<p>A consumer purchases food $X$ and clothing $Y$. Her utility function is given by: $U(X,Y) = XY +10Y$, income is $\$100$ the price of food is $\$1$ and the price of clothing is $P_y$.</p>

<p>Derive the equation for the consumer’s demand function for clothing.             </p>

<p>I found the first order conditions for $X$ and $Y$ and then solved for $Y$ which gave me $Y = X/P_y -10$ I then combined this with the budget constraint to get $2X - 10P_y = 100$ Please would it be possible to advise me whether whether my answers are correct as this is my first attempt at deriving demand functions. Also, is the utility quasilinear? I know that an equation  of the form $U(X,Y) = f(X) + Y$ is quasilinear but I don't know if $U(X,Y) = f(x,Y) + Y$ would fit the category. </p>
","<p>A demand function relates the quantity demanded of a good by a consumer with the price of the good. Thus we wish to find $Y = f(P_Y)$.</p>

<p>Setting up the optimization problem:</p>

<p>$$\max{U(X,Y)}$$</p>

<p>subject to: $$ I = P_x X + P_Y Y $$ </p>

<p>where $I$ is income, $P_X$ is the price of good $X$, and $P_Y$ is the price of good $Y$.</p>

<p>Using the values you provided gives the optimization problem as:</p>

<p>$$ \max{ (XY + 10Y) } $$</p>

<p>subject to: $$ 100 = 1 \cdot X + P_Y Y $$</p>

<p>Setting this up as a Legrange problem,</p>

<p>$$ L = XY + 10Y + \lambda (100 - X - P_Y Y )$$</p>

<p>Taking the first order conditions we get:</p>

<p>$[X]:$ $\frac{ \partial U(X,Y) }{ \partial X}  = Y - \lambda = 0$</p>

<p>$[Y]:$ $\frac{ \partial U(X,Y) }{ \partial Y}  = X + 10 - \lambda P_Y = 0$</p>

<p>$[ \lambda ]:$ $\frac{ \partial U(X,Y) }{ \partial \lambda }  =  100 - X - P_Y Y = 0$</p>

<p>Note, at this point you will usually take the second order conditions to ensure you have a maximum. Clearly you do have a maximum in this case since $U$ is strictly increasing in $X$ and $Y$.</p>

<p>Combining $[X]$ and $[Y]$ we get $X + 10 = Y P_Y$</p>

<p>We wish to get the demand for clothing, so we will solve for $X$ with the intention of substitution it into the budget constraint. $X = Y P_Y - 10$ Substituting into the constraint yields: $100 = 2 P_Y Y - 10$ or a final demand equation of:</p>

<p>$$ Y = \frac{45}{P_Y} $$</p>

<p>Finally, for a utility function to be quasi-linear, you must be able to express one utility as a linear function of one of the goods. Note in your case this may not be accomplished since you have an interaction between $X$ and $Y$. The reason quasi-linearity is nice is because it allows the expression of utility in terms of a numeraire good.</p>

<p>I know how to find the number of noncommutative ways to form the sum: Imagine a line of $n+k-1$ positions, where each position can contain either a cat or a divider. If you have $n$ (nameless) cats and $k-1$ dividers, you can split the cats in to $k$ groups by choosing positions for the dividers: $\binom{n+k-1}{k-1}$. The size of each group of cats corresponds to one of the nonnegative integers in the sum.</p>
","<p>As Brian M. Scott mentions, these are <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_%28number_theory%29"">partitions</a> of $n$.  However, allowing $0$ into the mix, makes them different to the usual definition of a partition (which assumes non-zero parts).  However, this can be adjusted for by taking partitions of $n+k$ into $k$ non-zero parts (and subtracting $1$ from each part).</p>

<p>If $p(k,n)$ is the number of partitions of $n$ into $k$ <em>non-zero</em> parts, then $p(k,n)$ satisfies the recurrence relation
\begin{align}
p(k,n) &amp;= 0 &amp; \text{if } k&gt;n \\
p(k,n) &amp;= 1 &amp; \text{if } k=n \\
p(k,n) &amp;= p(k+1,n)+p(k,n-k) &amp; \text{otherwise}. \\
\end{align}
(this recurrence is explained on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_%28number_theory%29#Intermediate_function"">Wikipedia</a>).  <em>Note</em>: in the above case, remember to change $n$ to $n+k$.  This gives a (moderately efficient) method for computing $p(k,n)$.</p>

How many different choices are there? Well that's the number of ways I can rearrange the $r$ chosen letters, which is $r!$. So if permutations matter:</p>

<p>$$P(n,r)=r!\cdot C(n,r)=\frac{r!n!}{(n-r)!r!}=\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$$</p>

<p>Permutations are the number of different <em>ordered</em> selections of $r$ elements from a set of $n$.</p>

"how to derive the mean and variance of a Gaussian Random variable?","58746","","<p>How do we go about deriving the values of mean and variance of a Gaussian Random Variable $X$  given its probability density function ?</p>
","<p><strong>UPDATE 21-03-2017</strong><br>
A much faster way is to differentiate both sides of </p>

<p>$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}\exp\left\{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right\}dx=1$$
with respect to the two parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ (RHS will then be zero).</p>

<hr>

<p>The Gaussian pdf is defined as
$$f_X(x) =\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left\{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right\}$$</p>

<p>where $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are two parameters, with $\sigma &gt;0$.
By definition of the mean we have
$$E(X) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left\{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right\}dx$$
which using integral properties can be written as</p>

<p>$$E(X) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}(x+\mu)\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left\{-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}\right\}dx$$</p>

<p>$$=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left\{-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}\right\}dx \;+\; \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\mu\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left\{-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}\right\}dx \qquad [1]$$</p>

<p>For the first integral, call it $I_1$ we have using additivity</p>

<p>$$I_1 = \int_{-\infty}^0x\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left\{-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}\right\}dx + \int_{0}^{\infty}x\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left\{-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}\right\}dx$$
Swapping the integration limits in the first we have</p>

<p>$$I_1 = -\int_{0}^{-\infty}x\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left\{-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}\right\}dx + \int_{0}^{\infty}x\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left\{-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}\right\}dx$$</p>

<p>and using again integral properties we have</p>

<p>$$I_1 = \int_{0}^{\infty}(-x)\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left\{-\frac{(-x)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right\}dx + \int_{0}^{\infty}x\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left\{-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}\right\}dx$$</p>

<p>$$\Rightarrow I_1 = -\int_{0}^{\infty}x\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left\{-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}\right\}dx + \int_{0}^{\infty}x\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left\{-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}\right\}dx = 0\qquad [2]$$</p>

<p>So we have that </p>

<p>$$E(X) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\mu\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left\{-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}\right\}dx $$</p>

<p>Multiply by $\sigma \sqrt2$ to obtain</p>

<p>$$E(X) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\mu\frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}}e^{-x^2} dx = \mu\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-x^2} dx$$</p>

<p>...the last term because the integrand is an even function.</p>

<p>Now $$\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-x^2} dx = \lim_{t\rightarrow \infty}\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\int_{0}^{t}e^{-x^2} dx = \lim_{t\rightarrow \infty} \text{erf}(t) = 1$$</p>

<p>where ""erf"" is the error function. So we end up with
$$E(X) = \mu$$
i.e. that the parameter $\mu$ is the mean of the distribution.  </p>

<p><strong>VARIANCE</strong><br>
We have</p>

<p>$$\text {Var}(X) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}(x-\mu)^2\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left\{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right\}dx$$</p>

<p>Applying the same tricks as before we have</p>

<p>$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}(x-\mu)^2\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left\{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right\}dx = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x^2\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left\{-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}\right\}dx  $$</p>

<p>$$=\sigma \sqrt2\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}(\sigma \sqrt2x)^2\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left\{-\frac{(\sigma \sqrt2x)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right\}dx = \sigma^2\frac{4}{\sqrt{\pi}}\int_{0}^{\infty}x^2e^{-x^2}dx$$</p>

<p>Define $t=x^2\Rightarrow x= \sqrt t$ and $dt = 2xdx = 2\sqrt tdx \Rightarrow dx = (2\sqrt t)^{-1}dt$. Substituting</p>

<p>$$V(X) = \sigma^2\frac{4}{\sqrt{\pi}}\int_{0}^{\infty}(\sqrt t)^2(2\sqrt t)^{-1}e^{-t}dt = 
\sigma^2\frac{4}{\sqrt{\pi}}\frac 12 \int_{0}^{\infty}t^{\frac 32 -1}e^{-t}dt= \sigma^2\frac{4}{\sqrt{\pi}}\frac 12 \Gamma\left(\frac 32\right)$$</p>

<p>$$\Rightarrow V(X) = \sigma^2\frac{4}{\sqrt{\pi}}\frac 12 \frac {\sqrt \pi}{2} = \sigma^2$$</p>

<p>where $\Gamma()$ is the Gamma function. So the parameter $\sigma$ is the square-root of the variance, i.e. the standard deviation.</p>

","<p>The reason why this can happen is that all vector spaces, and hence subspaces too, must be closed under addition (and scalar multiplication). The union of two subspaces takes all the elements already in those spaces, and nothing more.

","<p>You are confusing the terms ""independent"" and ""mutually exclusive"".&nbsp; These are <em>not</em> the same thing.&nbsp; In fact events <em>cannot</em> be both ""independent"" and ""mutually exclusive"".&nbsp; It's either one, the other, or neither.</p>

<p>""Mutually exclusive"" simply means that the two events cannot happen together.  If A happens then B does not and if B happens A does not.</p>

<p>""Independent"" simply means that the occurrence of one event is not conditional on the occurrence of the other.  The probability of A happening does not depend on whether B happens or not, and vice versa.</p>

<p>Given an unbiased coin, $P(H_1)=P(H_2)=\frac 1 2$</p>

"A simple explanation of eigenvectors and eigenvalues with 'big picture' ideas of why on earth they matter","58189","","<p>A number of areas I'm studying in my degree (not a maths degree) involve eigenvalues and eigvenvectors, which have never been properly explained to me. I find it very difficult to understand the explanations given in textbooks and lectures. Does anyone know of a good, fairly simple but mathematical explanation of eigenvectors and eigenvalues on the internet? If not, could someone provide one here?</p>

<p>As well as some of the mathematical explanations, I'm also very interested in 'big picture' answers as to why on earth I should care about eigenvectors/eigenvalues, and what they actually 'mean'.</p>
","<p>To understand why you encounter eigenvalues/eigenvectors everywhere, you must first understand why you encounter <strong>matrices</strong> and <strong>vectors</strong> everywhere.</p>

<p>In a vast number of situations, the objects you study and the stuff you can do with them relate to vectors and linear transformations, which are represented as matrices.</p>

<p>So, in many many interesting situations, important relations are expressed as
$$\vec{y} = M \vec{x}$$
where $\vec{y}$ and $\vec{x}$ are vectors and $M$ is a matrix. This ranges from systems of linear equations you have to solve (which occurs virtually everywhere in science and engineering) to more sophisticated engineering problems (finite element simulations). It also is the foundation for (a lot of) quantum mechanics. It is further used to describe the typical geometric transformations you can do with vector graphics and 3D graphics in computer games. </p>

<p>Now, it is generally not straight forward to look at some matrix $M$ and immediately tell what it is going to do when you multiply it with some vector $\vec{x}$. Also, in the study of iterative algorithms you need to know something about higher powers of the matrix $M$, i.e. $M^k = M \cdot M \cdot ... M$, $k$ times. This is a bit awkward and costly to compute in a naive fashion.</p>

<p>For a lot of matrices, you can find special vectors with a very simple relationship between the vector $\vec{x}$ itself, and the vector $\vec{y} = Mx$. For example, if you look at the matrix $\left( \begin{array}{cc} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0\end{array}\right)$, you see that the vector $\left(\begin{array}{c} 1\\ 1\end{array}\right)$ when multiplied with the matrix will just give you that vector again!</p>

<p>For such a vector, it is <em>very</em> easy to see what $M\vec{x}$ looks like, and even what $M^k \vec{x}$ looks like, since, obviously, repeated application won't change it.</p>

<p>This observation is generalized by the concept of eigenvectors. An eigenvector of a matrix $M$ is any vector $\vec{x}$ that only gets scaled (i.e. just multiplied by a number) when multiplied with $M$. Formally,
$$M\vec{x} = \lambda \vec{x}$$
for some number $\lambda$ (real or complex depending on the matrices you are looking at).</p>

<p>So, if your matrix $M$ describes a system of some sort, the eigenvectors are those vectors that, when they go through the system, are changed in a very easy way. If $M$, for example, describes geometric operations, then $M$ could, in principle, stretch and rotate your vectors. But eigenvectors only get stretched, not rotated. </p>

<p>The next important concept is that of an <strong>eigenbasis</strong>. By choosing a different basis for your vector space, you can alter the appearance of the matrix $M$ in that basis. Simply speaking, the $i$-th column of $M$ tells you what the $i$-th basis vector multiplied with $M$ would look like. If all your basis vectors are also eigenvectors, then it is not hard to see that the matrix $M$ is <em>diagonal</em>. Diagonal matrices are a welcome sight, because they are <em>really</em> easy to deal with: Matrix-vector and Matrix-matrix multiplication becomes very efficient, and computing the $k$-th power of a diagonal matrix is also trivial. </p>

<p>I think for a ""broad"" introduction this might suffice?</p>

"When you randomly shuffle a deck of cards, what is the probability that it is a unique permutation never before configured?","58155","","<p>I just came back from a class on Probability in Game Theory, and was musing over something in my head.</p>

<p>Assuming, for the sake of the question:</p>

<ul>
<li>Playing cards in their current state have been around for approximately eight centuries</li>
<li>A deck of playing cards is shuffled to a random configuration one billion times per day</li>
<li>Every shuffle ever is completely (theoretically) random and unaffected by biases caused by human shuffling and the games the cards are used for</li>
<li>By ""deck of cards"", I refer to a stack of unordered $52$ unique cards, with a composition that is identical from deck to deck.</li>
</ul>

<p>This would, approximately, be on the order of $3 \cdot 10^{14}$ random shuffles in the history of playing cards.</p>

<p>If I were to shuffle a new deck today, completely randomly, what are the probabilistic odds (out of $1$) that you create a new unique permutation of the playing cards that has never before been achieved in the history of $3 \cdot 10^{14}$ similarly random shuffles?</p>

<p>My first thought was to think that it was a simple matter of $\frac{1}{52!} \cdot 3 \cdot 10^{14}$, but then I ran into things like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_Paradox"">Birthday Paradox</a>.  While it is not analogous (I would have to be asking about the odds that any two shuffled decks in the history of shuffled decks ever matched), it has caused me to question my intuitive notions of Probability.</p>

<p>What is wrong in my initial approach, if it is wrong?</p>

<p>What is the true probability?</p>

<p>And, if the probability is less than $0.5$, if we how many more years (centuries?) must we wait, assuming the current rate of one billion shuffles per day, until we reach a state where the probability is $0.5$+?   $0.9$+?</p>

<p>(Out of curiosity, it would be neat to know the analogous birthday paradox answer, as well)</p>
","<p>Your original answer of $\dfrac{3 \times 10^{14}}{52!}$ is not far from being right. That is in fact the expected number of times any ordering of the cards has occurred.</p>

<p>The probability that any particular ordering of the cards has not occurred, given your initial assumptions, is $\left(1-\frac1{52!}\right)^{(3\times10^{14})}$, and the probability that it has occurred is 1 minus this value.  But for small values of $n\epsilon$, $(1+\epsilon)^n$ is nearly $1+n\epsilon$.  In particular, since $52!\approx 8\times 10^{67}$ and so $\dfrac{3\times10^{14}}{52!}\approx 3.75\times 10^{-54}$ is microscopically small, $1-\left(1-\frac1{52!}\right)^{(3\times10^{14})}$ is very nearly $\frac1{52!}\times (3\times10^{14})$.  </p>

Let me try to reproduce the proof here.</p>

<p>We will use several results in the proof, one of them is - as far as I can say - a little less known. It is the <a href=""http://www.proofwiki.org/wiki/Determinant_as_Sum_of_Determinants"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">theorem</a> which says, that if I have two matrices $A$ and $B$, which only differ in $k$-th row and other rows are the same, and the matrix $C$ has as the $k$-th row the sum of $k$-th rows of $A$ and $B$ and other rows are the same as in $A$ and $B$, then $|C|=|B|+|A|$.</p>

<p><a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/668/whats-an-intuitive-way-to-think-about-the-determinant"">Geometrically</a>, this corresponds to adding two parallelepipeds with the same base.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Proof.</strong>
Let us denote the rows of $A$ by $\vec\alpha_1,\ldots,\vec\alpha_n$. Thus
$$A=
\begin{pmatrix}
a_{11} &amp; a_{12}&amp; \ldots &amp; a_{1n}\\
a_{21} &amp; a_{22}&amp; \ldots &amp; a_{2n}\\
\vdots &amp; \vdots&amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
a_{n1} &amp; a_{n2}&amp; \ldots &amp; a_{nn}
\end{pmatrix}=
\begin{pmatrix}
\vec\alpha_1 \\ \vec\alpha_2 \\ \vdots \\ \vec\alpha_n
\end{pmatrix}$$</p>

<p>Directly from the definition of matrix product we can see
that the rows of $A.B$ are of the form $\vec\alpha_kB$, i.e.,
$$A.B=\begin{pmatrix}
\vec\alpha_1B \\ \vec\alpha_2B \\ \vdots \\ \vec\alpha_nB
\end{pmatrix}$$
Since $\vec\alpha_k=\sum_{i=1}^n a_{ki}\vec e_i$, we can
rewrite this equality as
$$A.B=\begin{pmatrix}
\sum_{i_1=1}^n a_{1i_1}\vec e_{i_1} B\\
\vdots\\
\sum_{i_n=1}^n a_{ni_n}\vec e_{i_n} B
\end{pmatrix}$$
Using the theorem on sum of determinants multiple times we get
$$
|{A.B}|= \sum_{i_1=1}^n a_{1i_1}
\begin{vmatrix}
\vec e_{i_1}B\\
\sum_{i_2=1}^n a_{2i_2}\vec e_{i_2} B\\
\vdots\\
\sum_{i_n=1}^n a_{ni_n}\vec e_{i_n} B
\end{vmatrix}= \ldots =
\sum_{i_1=1}^n \ldots \sum_{i_n=1}^n  a_{1i_1} a_{2i_2} \dots
a_{ni_n}
\begin{vmatrix}
\vec e_{i_1} B \\ \vec e_{i_2} B \\ \vdots \\ \vec e_{i_n} B
\end{vmatrix}
$$</p>

<p>Now notice that if $i_j=i_k$ for some $j\ne k$, then
the corresponding determinant in the above sum is zero (it has two <a href=""http://www.proofwiki.org/wiki/Square_Matrix_with_Duplicate_Rows_has_Zero_Determinant"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">identical rows</a>).
Thus the only nonzero summands are those one, for which the $n$-tuple
$(i_1,i_2,\dots,i_n)$ represents a permutation of the numbers $1,\ldots,n$.
Thus we get
$$|{A.B}|=\sum_{\varphi\in S_n} a_{1\varphi(1)} a_{2\varphi(2)} \dots a_{n\varphi(n)}
\begin{vmatrix}
\vec e_{\varphi(1)} B \\ \vec e_{\varphi(2)} B \\ \vdots \\ \vec
e_{\varphi(n)} B
\end{vmatrix}$$
(Here $S_n$ denotes the set of all permutations of $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$.)
The matrix on the RHS of the above equality is the matrix
$B$ with permuted rows. Using several transpositions of rows we can get the matrix
$B$. We will show that this can be done using
$i(\varphi)$ transpositions, where $i(\varphi)$ denotes the number of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_%28discrete_mathematics%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">inversions</a> of $\varphi$.
Using this fact we get 
$$|{A.B}|=\sum_{\varphi\in S_n} a_{1\varphi(1)} a_{2\varphi(2)} \dots a_{n\varphi(n)} (-1)^{i(\varphi)} |{B}| =|A|.|B|.$$</p>

<p>It remains to show that we need $i(\varphi)$ transpositions.
We can transform the ""permuted matrix"" to matrix $B$
as follows: we first move the first row of $B$ on the first place
by exchanging it with the preceding row until it is on the correct position.
(If it already is in the first position, we make no exchanges at all.) 
The number of transpositions we have used is exactly the number
of inversions of $\varphi$ that contains the number 1.
Now we can move the second row to the second place in the same way.
We will use the same number of transposition as the number of inversions of $\varphi$
containing 2 but not containing 1. (Since the first row is already in place.)
We continue in the same way. 
We see that by using this procedure we obtain the matrix
$B$ after $i(\varphi)$ row transpositions.</p>

<li><p>We already know that this set isn’t a subspace of $\Bbb R^3$, but let’s check closure under addition just for the practice. The vector $\langle 0,0,1\rangle$ is certainly in this set, but when you add it to itself, you get $\langle 0,0,2\rangle$, which is not in the set: this set is not closed under vector addition.</p></li>

Just do the algebra: $$(a+x)-(b+y)=(a-b)+(x-y)=c+z\;,$$ so the answer is <em>yes</em>, and this set <strong>is</strong> closed under vector addition.</p></li>
<li><p>HINT: Consider the vectors $\langle 0,1,0\rangle$ and $\langle 1,0,0\rangle$.</p></li>

<p>That should be enough to get you started; see if you can check for closure under scalar multiplication on your own.</p>

<p>Quantity a) The probability of selecting either a black marble or a red marble 
Quantity b) The probability of selecting either a yellow marble or a green marble</p>

<p>Whether Quantity a will be greater ?
Whether Quantity b will be greater ?
Whether two Quantities are equal ?

","<p>I assume you mean the bag contains 4 black marbles.  </p>

<p>There are 16 marbles total and we assume that outcomes are equally likely.  That is, we assume that any particular marble is just as likely to be chosen as any other. Then, since there are 16 marbles total, the probability of selecting any particular marble is $1/16$. </p>

<p>In general, if outcomes are equally likely, then to find the probability of an event $A$, compute
$$\text { size of }A\over\text{total number of outcomes}.$$
In the above ""size of $A$"" is the number of outcomes that make up $A$.  </p>

<p>For $A$ being the event ""a black or red marble was chosen"", the size is $7$, (one of the 4 black or one of the 3 red were chosen). So, the probability that a black or red marble was chosen is $ 7/16$.</p>

<p>If $A$ is the event the event ""a yellow or green marble is chosen"", the size of $A$ is 9, and the corresponding probability is $9/16$.</p>

"What exactly is the difference between a derivative and a total derivative?","57166","","<p>I am not too grounded in differentiation but today, I was posed with a supposedly easy question $w = f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2$ where $x = r\sin\theta $ and $y = r\cos\theta$ requiring the solution to $\partial w / \partial r$ and $\partial w / \partial \theta $. I simply solved the former using the trig identity $\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1$, resulting to $\partial w / \partial r = 2r$.</p>

<p>However I was told that this solution could not be applied to this question because I should be solving for the <strong><em>total derivative</em></strong>. I could not find any good resource online to explain clearly to me the difference between a <em>normal</em> derivative and a <em>total</em> derivative and why my solution here was <em>wrong</em>. Is there anyone who could explain the difference to me using a practical example? Thanks!</p>
","<p>The key difference is that when you take a <em>partial derivative</em>, you operate under a sort of assumption that you hold one variable fixed while the other changes. When computing a <em>total derivative</em>, you allow changes in one variable to affect the other.</p>

<p>So, for instance, if you have $f(x,y) = 2x+3y$, then when you compute the partial derivative $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$, you temporarily assume $y$ constant and treat it as such, yielding $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 2 + \frac{\partial (3y)}{\partial x} = 2 + 0 = 2$.</p>

<p>However, if $x=x(r,\theta)$ and $y=y(r,\theta)$, then the assumption that $y$ stays constant when $x$ changes is no longer valid. Since $x = x(r,\theta)$, then if $x$ changes, this implies that at least one of $r$ or $\theta$ change. And if $r$ or $\theta$ change, then $y$ changes. And if $y$ changes, then obviously it has some sort of effect on the derivative and we can no longer assume it to be equal to zero.</p>

<p>In your example, you are given $f(x,y) = x^2+y^2$, but what you really have is the following:</p>

<p>$f(x,y) = f(x(r,\theta),y(r,\theta))$.</p>

<p>So if you compute $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$, you cannot assume that the change in $x$ computed in this derivative has no effect on a change in $y$.</p>

<p>What you need to compute instead is $\frac{\rm{d} f}{\rm{d}\theta}$ and $\frac{\rm{d} f}{\rm{d} r}$, the first of which can be computed as:</p>

<p>$\frac{\rm{d} f}{\rm{d}\theta} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial \theta} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\frac{\rm{d} x}{\rm{d} \theta} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\frac{\rm{d} y}{\rm{d} \theta}$</p>

"Partial derivative in gradient descent for two variables","56444","","<p>I've started taking an <a href=""http://www.ml-class.org/"">online machine learning class</a>, and the first learning algorithm that we are going to be using is a form of linear regression using gradient descent. I don't have much of a background in high level math, but here is what I understand so far.</p>

<p>Given $m$ number of items in our learning set, with $x$ and $y$ values, we must find the best fit line $h_\theta(x) = \theta_0+\theta_1x$ . The cost function for any guess of $\theta_0,\theta_1$ can be computed as:</p>

<p>$J(\theta_0,\theta_1) = \frac{1}{2m}\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^m(h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2$</p>

<p>where $x^{(i)}$ and $y^{(i)}$ are the $x$ and $y$ values for the $i^{th}$ component in the learning set. If we substitute for $h_\theta(x)$,</p>

<p>$J(\theta_0,\theta_1) = \frac{1}{2m}\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^m(\theta_0 + \theta_1x^{(i)} - y^{(i)})^2$</p>

<p>Then, the goal of gradient descent can be expressed as</p>

<p>$\displaystyle\min_{\theta_0, \theta_1}\;J(\theta_0, \theta_1)$</p>

<p>Finally, each step in the gradient descent can be described as:</p>

<p>$\theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta_j} J(\theta_0,\theta_1)$</p>

<p>for $j = 0$ and $j = 1$ with $\alpha$ being a constant representing the rate of step. </p>

<p>I have no idea how to do the partial derivative. I have never taken calculus, but conceptually I understand what a derivative represents. The instructor gives us the partial derivatives for both $\theta_0$ and $\theta_1$ and says not to worry if we don't know how it was derived. (I suppose, technically, it is a computer class, not a mathematics class) However, I would very much like to understand this if possible. Could someone show how the partial derivative could be taken, or link to some resource that I could use to learn more? I apologize if I haven't used the correct terminology in my question; I'm very new to this subject.</p>
","<p>The answer above is a good one, but I thought I'd add in some more ""layman's"" terms that helped me better understand concepts of partial derivatives. The answers I've seen here and in the Coursera forums leave out talking about the chain rule, which is important to know if you're going to get what this is doing...</p>

<hr>

<p>It's helpful for me to think of partial derivatives this way: the variable you're
focusing on is treated as a variable, the other terms just numbers. Other key
concepts that are helpful:</p>

<ul>
<li>For ""regular derivatives"" of a simple form like $F(x) = cx^n$ , the derivative is simply $F'(x) = cn \times x^{n-1}$ </li>
<li>The derivative of a constant (a number) is 0.</li>
<li>Summations are just passed on in derivatives; they don't affect the derivative. Just copy them down in place as you derive.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, it should be mentioned that the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule"">chain
rule</a> is being used. The chain rule says
that (in clunky laymans terms), for $g(f(x))$, you take the derivative of $g(f(x))$,
treating $f(x)$ as the variable, and then multiply by the derivative of $f(x)$. For
our cost function, think of it this way:</p>

<p>$$ g(\theta_0, \theta_1) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^m \left(f(\theta_0,
\theta_1)^{(i)}\right)^2 \tag{1}$$</p>

<p>$$ f(\theta_0, \theta_1)^{(i)} = \theta_0 + \theta_{1}x^{(i)} -
y^{(i)} \tag{2}$$</p>

<p>To show I'm not pulling funny business, sub in the definition of $f(\theta_0,
\theta_1)^{(i)}$ into the definition of $g(\theta_0, \theta_1)$ and you get:</p>

<p>$$ g(f(\theta_0, \theta_1)^{(i)}) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^m \left(\theta_0 +
\theta_{1}x^{(i)} - y^{(i)}\right)^2 \tag{3}$$</p>

<p>This is, indeed, our entire cost function.</p>

<p>Thus, the partial derivatives work like this:</p>

<p>$$ \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_0} g(\theta_0, \theta_1) = \frac{\partial}{\partial
\theta_0} \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^m \left(f(\theta_0, \theta_1)^{(i)}\right)^2 = 2
\times \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^m \left(f(\theta_0, \theta_1)^{(i)}\right)^{2-1} = \tag{4}$$</p>

<p>$$\frac{1}{m}
\sum_{i=1}^m f(\theta_0, \theta_1)^{(i)}$$</p>

<p>In other words, just treat $f(\theta_0, \theta_1)^{(i)}$ like a variable and you have a
simple derivative of $\frac{1}{2m} x^2 = \frac{1}{m}x$</p>

<p>$$ \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_0} f(\theta_0, \theta_1)^{(i)} = \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_0} (\theta_0 + \theta_{1}x^{(i)} - y^{(i)}) \tag{5}$$</p>

<p>And $\theta_1, x$, and $y$ are just ""a number"" since we're taking the derivative with
respect to $\theta_0$, so the partial of $g(\theta_0, \theta_1)$ becomes:</p>

<p>$$ \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_0} f(\theta_0, \theta_1) = \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_0} (\theta_0 + [a \
number][a \ number]^{(i)} - [a \ number]^{(i)}) = \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_0}
\theta_0 = 1 \tag{6}$$</p>

<p>So, using the chain rule, we have:</p>

<p>$$ \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_0} g(f(\theta_0, \theta_1)^{(i)}) =
\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_0} g(\theta_0, \theta_1) \frac{\partial}{\partial
\theta_0}f(\theta_0, \theta_1)^{(i)} \tag{7}$$</p>

<p>And subbing in the partials of $g(\theta_0, \theta_1)$ and $f(\theta_0, \theta_1)^{(i)}$
from above, we have:</p>

<p>$$ \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m f(\theta_0, \theta_1)^{(i)} \frac{\partial}{\partial
\theta_0}f(\theta_0, \theta_1)^{(i)} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \left(\theta_0 +
\theta_{1}x^{(i)} - y^{(i)}\right) \times 1 = \tag{8}$$</p>

<p>$$ \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \left(\theta_0 + \theta_{1}x^{(i)} - y^{(i)}\right)$$</p>

<hr>

<p>What about the derivative with respect to $\theta_1$?</p>

<p>Our term $g(\theta_0, \theta_1)$ is identical, so we just need to take the derivative
of $f(\theta_0, \theta_1)^{(i)}$, this time treating $\theta_1$ as the variable and the
other terms as ""just a number."" That goes like this:</p>

<p>$$ \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_1} f(\theta_0, \theta_1)^{(i)} = \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_1} (\theta_0 + \theta_{1}x^{(i)} - y^{(i)}) \tag{9}$$</p>

<p>$$ \frac{\partial}{\partial
\theta_1} f(\theta_0, \theta_1)^{(i)} = \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_1} ([a \ number] +
\theta_{1}[a \ number, x^{(i)}] - [a \ number]) \tag{10}$$</p>

<p>Note that the ""just a number"", $x^{(i)}$, <em>is</em> important in this case because the
derivative of $c \times x$ (where $c$ is some number) is $\frac{d}{dx}(c \times x^1) =
c \times 1 \times x^{(1-1=0)} = c \times 1 \times 1 = c$, so the number will carry
through. In this case that number is $x^{(i)}$ so we need to keep it. Thus, our
derivative is:</p>

<p>$$ \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_1} f(\theta_0, \theta_1)^{(i)} = 0 + (\theta_{1})^1
x^{(i)} - 0 = 1 \times \theta_1^{(1-1=0)} x^{(i)} = 1 \times 1 \times x^{(i)} =
x^{(i)} \tag{11}$$</p>

<p>Thus, the entire answer becomes:</p>

<p>$$ \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_1} g(f(\theta_0, \theta_1)^{(i)}) =
\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_1} g(\theta_0, \theta_1) \frac{\partial}{\partial
\theta_1} f(\theta_0, \theta_1)^{(i)} = \tag{12}$$</p>

<p>$$\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m f(\theta_0, \theta_1)^{(i)} \frac{\partial}{\partial
\theta_1}f(\theta_0, \theta_1)^{(i)} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \left(\theta_0 +
\theta_{1}x^{(i)} - y^{(i)}\right) x^{(i)}$$</p>

<hr>

<p>A quick addition per @Hugo's comment below. Let's ignore the fact that we're dealing with vectors at all, which drops the summation and $fu^{(i)}$ bits. We can also more easily use real numbers this way.</p>

<p>$\require{cancel}$</p>

<p>Let's say $x = 2$ and $y = 4$.</p>

<p>So, for part 1 you have:</p>

<p>$$\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_0} (\theta_0 + \theta_{1}x - y)$$</p>

<p>Filling in the values for $x$ and $y$, we have:</p>

<p>$$\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_0} (\theta_0 + 2\theta_{1} - 4)$$</p>

<p>We only care about $\theta_0$, so $\theta_1$ is treated like a constant (any number, so let's just say it's 6).</p>

<p>$$\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_0} (\theta_0 + (2 \times 6) - 4) = \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_0} (\theta_0 + \cancel8) = 1$$</p>

<p>Using the same values, let's look at the $\theta_1$ case (same starting point with $x$ and $y$ values input):</p>

<p>$$\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_1} (\theta_0 + 2\theta_{1} - 4)$$</p>

<p>In this case we <em>do</em> care about $\theta_1$, but $\theta_0$ is treated as a constant; we'll do the same as above and use 6 for it's value:</p>

<p>$$\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_1} (6 + 2\theta_{1} - 4) = \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_1} (2\theta_{1} + \cancel2) = 2 = x$$</p>

<p>The answer is 2 because we ended up with $2\theta_1$ and we had <em>that</em> because $x = 2$. </p>

<p>Hopefully the clarifies a bit on why in the first instance (wrt $\theta_0$) I wrote ""just a number,"" and in the second case (wrt $\theta_1$) I wrote ""just a number, $x^{(i)}$. While it's true that $x^{(i)}$ is still ""just a number"", since it's attached to the variable of interest in the second case it's value will carry through which is why we end up at $x^{(i)}$ for the result.</p>

"Relationship between Binomial and Bernoulli?","55767","","<p>How should I understand the difference or relationship between Binomial and Bernoulli distribution?</p>
","<p>A Bernoulli random variable has two possible outcomes:  $0$ or $1$.  A binomial distribution is the sum of independent and identically distributed Bernoulli random variables.</p>

<p>So for example, say I have a coin, and when tossed, the probability it lands heads is $p$.  So the probability that it lands tails is $1-p$ (there are no other possible outcomes for the coin toss).  If the coin lands heads, you win one dollar.  If the coin lands tails, you win nothing.</p>

<p>For a <em>single</em> coin toss, the probability you win one dollar is $p$.  The random variable that represents your winnings after one coin toss is a Bernoulli random variable.</p>

<p>Now, if you toss the coin $5$ times, your winnings could be any whole number of dollars from zero dollars to five dollars, inclusive.  The probability that you win five dollars is $p^5$, because each coin toss is independent of the others, and for each coin toss, the probability of heads is $p$.</p>

<p>What is the probability that you win <em>exactly</em> three dollars in five tosses?  That would require you to toss the coin five times, getting exactly three heads and two tails.  This can be achieved with probability $\binom{5}{3} p^3 (1-p)^2$.  And in general, if there are $n$ Bernoulli trials, then the sum of those trials is binomially distributed with parameters $n$ and $p$.</p>

","<p>Here’s a way to think about symmetry and antisymmetry that some people find helpful. A relation $R$ on a set $A$ has a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph""><em>directed graph</em></a> (or <em>digraph</em>) $G_R$: the vertices of $G_R$ are the elements of $A$, and for any $a,b\in A$ there is an edge in $G_R$ from $a$ to $b$ if and only if $\langle a,b\rangle\in R$. Think of the edges of $G_R$ as streets. The properties of symmetry, antisymmetry, and reflexivity have very simple interpretations in these terms:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>$R$ is reflexive if and only if there is a loop at every vertex. (A loop is an edge from some vertex to itself.)</p></li>
<li><p>$R$ is symmetric if and only if every edge in $G_R$ is a two-way street or a loop. Equivalently, $G_R$ has no one-way streets between distinct vertices.</p></li>
<li><p>$R$ is antisymmetric if and only every edge of $G_R$ is either a one-way street or a loop. Equivalently, $G_R$ has no two-way streets between distinct vertices.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This makes it clear that if $G_R$ has only loops, $R$ is both symmetric and antisymmetric: $R$ is symmetric because $G_R$ has no one-way streets between distinct vertices, and $R$ is antisymmetric because $G_R$ has no two-way streets between distinct vertices.</p>

<p>To make a relation that is neither symmetric nor antisymmetric, just find a digraph that has both a one-way street and a two-way street, like this one:</p>

<p>$$0\longrightarrow 1\longleftrightarrow 2$$</p>

<p>When calculating values of these, it is important to realize that the angle can be measured in various ways, the most common being degrees and radians.   $360$ degrees is $2\pi$ radians. In general to convert $x$ degrees to radians, multiply $x$ by $\pi/180$.   </p>

<p>You can use either measurement system for the angle, but when calculating $\sin$ and $\cos$ using a device, make sure you measure the angle as needed by that device.  </p>

<p>In your example, with an angle of $45$ degrees, if you  find $\sin(45^\circ)$ and $\cos(45^\circ)$ from a calculator, make sure the calculator is set to use degrees as the measure. Using Google's calculator (which by default uses radians), we must input $\sin(45\ \text{ degrees})$ and $\cos(45\ \text{ degrees})$. This returns</p>

<p>Edit: making the square more explicit.  Imagine dividing the diagonal into $n$ segments and a stairstep approximation.  Each triangle is $(\frac{1}{n},\frac{1}{n},\frac{\sqrt{2}}{n})$.

So I just stack there. Is there easy way to find the $K$ ?</p>

<p>If you have any idea, Please post on the wall 
Thank you !</p>
","<p>The $K$ in your formula is the largest possible <strong>absolute value</strong> of the second derivative of your function. So let $f(x)=x\cos x$. We calculate the second derivative of $f(x)$.</p>

<p>We have $f&#39;(x)=-x\sin x+\cos x$. Differentiate again. We get 
$$f&#39;&#39;(x)=-x\cos x-\sin x-\sin x=-(2\sin x+x\cos x).$$  </p>

<p>Now <em>in principle</em>, to find the best value of $K$, we should find the maximum of the absolute value of the second derivative. But we won't do that, it is too much trouble, and not really worth it.</p>

<p>So how big can the absolute value of the second derivative be? Let's be <em>very</em> pessimistic. The number $x$ could be as large as $\pi$. The absolute value of $\cos x$ and $\sin x$ is never bigger than $1$, so for sure the absolute value of the second derivative is $\le 2+\pi$. Thus, if we use $K=2+\pi$, we can be sure that we are taking a pessimistically large value for $K$.  </p>

<p>Note that at $\pi$, the cosine is $-1$ and the sine is $0$, so the absolute value of the second derivative can be as large as $\pi$.</p>

<p>We can be less pessimistic. In the interval from $0$ to $\pi/2$, our second derivative is less than $2+\pi/2$. We can do better than that by looking at the second derivative in more detail, say between $0$ and $\pi/4$, and between $\pi/4$ and $\pi/2$.   </p>

<p>In the interval from $\pi/2$ to $\pi$, the cosine is negative, while the sine is positive. The sine is definitely $\le 2$. The $x\cos x$ term is negative, so in the interval $[\pi/2,\pi]$, the absolute value of the derivative is less than or equal to the larger of $2$ and $\pi$, which is $\pi$. </p>

<p>So we have reduced our upper bound on the absolute value of the second derivative to $2+\pi/2$, say about $3.6$.  We could do a bit better by graphing the second derivative on a graphing calculator, and eyeballing the largest absolute value. </p>

<p>It's not worth it. Use $K\le 3.6$ (or even $2+\pi$). Then we know that the error has absolute value which is less than or equal to 
$$\frac{3.6\pi^3}{12n^2}.$$ 
We want to make sure that the above quantity is $\le 0.0001$. Equivalently, we want 
$$n^2\ge \frac{3.6\pi^3}{(12)(0.0001}.$$
Finally, calculate. I get something like $n=305$.</p>

<p><strong>Remark:</strong> There are many reasons not to work too hard to find the largest possible absolute value of the second derivative. If we are using numerical integration on $f$, it is probably because $f$ is at least a little unpleasant. Usually then, $f&#39;&#39;$  will be more unpleasant still, and finding the maximum of its absolute value could be very difficult.</p>

<p>In addition, using the maximum of $|f&#39;&#39;(x)|$ usually gives a needlessly pessimistic error estimate. I am certain that for the Trapezoidal Rule with your function, in reality we only need an $n$ much smaller than $305$ to get error $\le 0.0001$. The error estimate for the Trapezoidal Rule is close to the truth only for some really weird functions. For ""nice"" functions, the error bound you were given is unduly pessimistic.</p>

<p>The usual procedure is to calculate say $T_2$, $T_4$, $T_8$, and so on until successive answers change by less than one's error tolerance. This is theoretically not good enough, but works well in practice, particularly if you cross your fingers.</p>

<p>Since no such counterexample exists in for your relation, it is <em>trivially true</em> that the relation <em>is antisymmetric</em>.</p>

"Why is the eigenvector of a covariance matrix equal to a principal component?","54865","","<p>If I have a covariance matrix for a data set and I multiply it times one of it's eigenvectors.  Let's say the eigenvector with the highest eigenvalue.  The result is the eigenvector or a scaled version of the eigenvector.  </p>

<p>What does this really tell me?  Why is this the principal component?  What property makes it a principal component?  Geometrically, I understand that the principal component (eigenvector) will be sloped at the general slope of the data (loosely speaking).  Again, can someone help understand why this happens?  </p>
","<p><strong>Short answer:</strong> The eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue is the direction along which the data set has the maximum variance. Meditate upon this.</p>

<p><strong>Long answer:</strong> Let's say you want to reduce the dimensionality of your data set, say down to just one dimension. In general, this means picking a unit vector $u$, and replacing each data point, $x_i$, with its projection along this vector, $u^T x_i$. Of course, you should choose $u$ so that you retain as much of the variation of the data points as possible: if your data points lay along a line and you picked $u$ orthogonal to that line, all the data points would project onto the same value, and you would lose almost all the information in the data set! So you would like to maximize the <em>variance</em> of the new data values $u^T x_i$. It's not hard to show that if the covariance matrix of the original data points $x_i$ was $\Sigma$, the variance of the new data points is just $u^T \Sigma u$. As $\Sigma$ is symmetric, the unit vector $u$ which maximizes $u^T \Sigma u$ is nothing but the eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue.</p>

<p>If you want to retain more than one dimension of your data set, in principle what you can do is first find the largest principal component, call it $u_1$, then subtract that out from all the data points to get a ""flattened"" data set that has <em>no</em> variance along $u_1$. Find the principal component of this flattened data set, call it $u_2$. If you stopped here, $u_1$ and $u_2$ would be a basis of the two-dimensional subspace which retains the most variance of the original data; or, you can repeat the process and get as many dimensions as you want. As it turns out, all the vectors $u_1, u_2, \ldots$ you get from this process are just the eigenvectors of $\Sigma$ in decreasing order of eigenvalue. That's why these are the principal components of the data set.</p>

"Physical meaning of the null space of a matrix","54609","","<p>What is an <em>intuitive</em> meaning of the null space of a matrix? Why is it useful?</p>

So that means I can relate <em>rank</em> (and also dimension) to actual coordinate systems, and so it makes sense to me. But I can't think of any physical meaning for a null space... could someone explain what its meaning would be, for example, in a coordinate system?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>If $A$ is your matrix, the null-space is simply put, the set of all vectors $v$ such that $A \cdot v = 0$. It's good to think of the matrix as a linear transformation; if you let $h(v) = A \cdot v$, then the null-space is again the set of all vectors that are sent to the zero vector by $h$. Think of this as the set of vectors that <em>lose their identity</em> as $h$ is applied to them.</p>

<p>And I have, </p>

<p>Since $f(x) = x^7+x^5+x^3+1$ is a polynomial then it is continuous over all the real numbers, (-∞,∞). Since f(x)is continuous on (-∞,∞) then it is certainly continuous on $[-1,0]$ and the Intermediate Value Theorem applies. The I.V.T. states that since $f(x)$ is continuous on $[-1,0]$ we can let $C$ be any number between $f(-1)=-2$ and $f(0)=1$, namely $C=0$, then there exists a number $c$ with $-1 &lt; c &lt; 0$ such that $f(c)=C=0$. Since $f(x)$ is continuous on $[-1,0]$ and differentiable on $(-1,0)$ then Rolle’s Theorem applies. Rolle’s Theorem states that if a function $f:[a,b] \to R$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$ then if $f(a)=f(b)$, there exists a point $c \in (a,b)$ such that $f'(c)=0$. We assume that there is more than one real solution for this equation, namely $f(a)=0=f(b)$. If there exists more than one real solution for $f(x)=0$ then $f(a)=0=f(b)\implies a=b$, and thus there is only one real solution to the equation, as desired. </p>

<p>But I feel  I am missing something, and I'm not sure how to show that the equation is differentiable on the interval and that Rolle's Theorem applies.</p>

<p><strong>Added:</strong> Let's recap what's going on here. You want some lines that are to be parallel to the line $x-2y=2$. That line has slope $1/2$, so your lines have to have slope $1/2$: that's how you know that they're parallel to the line $x-2y=2$. (If they had a different slope, they'd eventually cross it somewhere.) The derivative $\frac2{(x+1)^2}$ gives the slope of the tangent at any point on the curve $y=\frac{x-1}{x+1}$; we want to know where that slope is $1/2$, so we set the derivative equal to $1/2$ in $(1)$ and solve for $x$. You found that $x=-3$ or $x=1$, so there are two points on the curve where the tangent is parallel to the line $x-2y=2$; one is $(-3,2)$, and the other is $(1,0)$. Now you just find the tangent lines to $y=\frac{x-1}{x+1}$ at those two points.</p>

Assume that the plane reaches the required takeoff velocity at the end of the runway. What is the time $t_{TO}$ needed to take off?</p>

<p>I tried to find time by using only distance and acceleration, so $\frac{v_f-v_i}{a} = \frac{1800}{5} = 360 \, s$. However, this is incorrect. I also tried taking the square root of the answer, however that too is incorrect. Any help would be appreciated.</p>
","<p>The acceleration is $a=5$, and you start from rest at position zero on the runway. The runway length is $L = 1800$.</p>

<p>Your speed will be $v(t) = \int_0^t a d \tau = at$. (Starting from rest means $v(0) = 0$.)</p>

<p>Your position will be $x(t) = \int_0^t v(\tau) d \tau = \int_0^t a \tau d \tau = a \frac{t^2}{2}$. (Starting from 'position zero' means we are taking $x(0) = 0$.)</p>

<p>So we need to solve $L = x(t) = a \frac{t^2}{2}$ for $t$.</p>

<p>This gives $t = \sqrt{\frac{2L}{a}} = \sqrt{720}$ ($\approx 27$ seconds).</p>

"Units of a log of a physical quantity","53375","","<p>So I have never actually found a good answer or even a good resource which discusses this so I appeal to experts here at stack exchange because this problem came up again today. What happens to the units of a physical quantity after I take its (natural) logarithm. Suppose I am working with some measured data and the units are Volts. Then I want to plot the time series on a log-scale, only the ordinate is on the log scale, not the abscissa. So the x-axis is definitely in time (seconds let's say) but what are the units on the y-axis? Will it be Volts or log(Volts) or something? If I square the quantities, then the units are squared too so what if I take the log? A rationale in addition to the answer will be appreciated as well.</p>

<p>I guess whatever the answer, the same goes for taking the exponential or sine of the data too, right?</p>
","<p>Overall, the argument $x$ of $\ln(x)$ must be unitless, and a log transformed quantity must be unitless. If $x = 0.5$ is measured in some units, say, seconds, then taking the log actually means $\ln(0.5s/1s) = \ln(0.5)$. See <a href=""http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ed1000476"">this</a> for more information about other transcendental functions. Hope this helps.</p>

"Problem when integrating $e^x / x$.","53114","","<p>I made up some integrals to do for fun, and I had a real problem with this one. I've since found out that there's no solution in terms of elementary functions, but when I attempt to integrate it, I end up with infinite values. Could somebody point out where I go wrong?</p>

<p>So, I'm trying to determine: $$ \int{\frac{e^x}{x}} \, dx $$</p>

<p>Integrate by parts, where $u = 1/x$, and $v \, ' = e^x$. Then $u \, ' = - 1/x^2$, and $v=e^x$. So,</p>

<p>$$\int{\frac{e^x}{x}} \, dx = \frac{e^x}{x} + \int{\frac{e^x}{x^2}} \, dx$$</p>

<p>Integrate by parts again, $u = 1/x^2$, $v \, ' = e^x$, so that $u \, ' = -2/x^3$ and $v=e^x$. So,</p>

<p>$$\int{\frac{e^x}{x}} \, dx = \frac{e^x}{x} + \frac{e^x}{x^2} + 2\int{\frac{e^x}{x^3}} \, dx$$</p>

<p>Repeat this process ad infinitum to get,</p>

<p>$$\int{\frac{e^x}{x}} \, dx = \frac{e^x}{x} + \frac{e^x}{x^2} + 2 \left( \frac{e^x}{x^3} + 3 \left( \frac{e^x}{x^4} + 4 \left( \frac{e^x}{x^5} + \, \cdots \right) \right) \right) $$</p>

<p>Expanding this gives,</p>

<p>$$\int{\frac{e^x}{x}} \, dx = \frac{e^x}{x} + \frac{e^x}{x^2} + \frac{2e^x}{x^3} + \frac{6 e^x}{x^4} + \frac{24 e^x}{x^5} + \cdots $$</p>

<p>And factoring that gives,</p>

<p>$$\int{\frac{e^x}{x}} \, dx = \frac{e^x}{x} \left(  1 + \frac{1}{x} + \frac{2}{x^2} + \frac{6}{x^3} + \frac{24}{x^4} + \cdots \right) $$</p>

<p>Now, considering the series itself, the ratio between the $n^{th}$ term and the $(n-1)^{th}$ term = $\Large \frac{n}{x}$. Eventually, $n$ will be larger than $x$, so the ratio between successive terms will be positive, so (assuming $x$ is positive), the series diverges, meaning (and I'm sure everybody will cringe upon seeing notation used like this), that:</p>

<p>$$\int{\frac{e^x}{x}} \, dx = \frac{e^x}{x} \left( \infty \right) = \infty $$</p>
","<p>This part looks right:</p>

<p>$$\int{\frac{e^x}{x}} \, dx = \frac{e^x}{x} + \frac{e^x}{x^2} + \frac{2e^x}{x^3} + \frac{6 e^x}{x^4} + \frac{24 e^x}{x^5} + \cdots+ \frac{n!e^x}{x^{n+1}}+(n+1)!\int \frac{e^x}{x^{n+1}}$$</p>

<p>When you say ""repeating to infinity"" you want to take the limit of that...in order for your equality to hold, you need</p>

<p>$$\lim_n (n+1)!\int \frac{e^x}{x^{n+1}}=0 \,.$$</p>

<p>because that is your error in you partial sum ""approximation"". But not only the above limit is not 0, it actually makes no sense (an integral is a family of functions, what happens with the constant???). </p>

<p>That's why formally, whenever you use a process like this, you need to prove that the difference between your n-th term and the limit goes to 0...</p>

<p>Your idea is similar to the following</p>

<p>\begin{eqnarray}
1&amp;=&amp;1+1-1\\
&amp;=&amp;1+1+1-2 \\
&amp;=&amp;1+1+1+1-3\\
&amp;=&amp;....
\end{eqnarray}</p>

<p>Taking limit to infinity you get</p>

<p>$$1=1+1+1+...+1+...= \infty$$</p>

<p>On this example you can see immediately that the ""errror"" in our appoximations don't go to 0, so our approximations are not approximations.</p>

<p>I don't know how to solve this (without counting directly), though I guess it has something to do with some recurrence.</p>

<p>How can count the number of all triangles in the picture ?</p>
","<p>Say that instead of four triangles along each edge we have $n$. First count the triangles that point up. This is easy to do if you count them by top vertex. Each vertex in the picture is the top of one triangle for every horizontal grid line below it. Thus, the topmost vertex, which has $n$ horizontal gridlines below it, is the top vertex of $n$ triangles; each of the two vertices in the next row down is the top vertex of $n-1$ triangles; and so on. This gives us a total of</p>

<p>$$\begin{align*}
\sum_{k=1}^nk(n+1-k)&amp;=\frac12n(n+1)^2-\sum_{k=1}^nk^2\\
&amp;=\frac12n(n+1)^2-\frac16n(n+1)(2n+1)\\
&amp;=\frac16n(n+1)\Big(3(n+1)-(2n+1)\Big)\\
&amp;=\frac16n(n+1)(n+2)\\
&amp;=\binom{n+2}3
\end{align*}$$</p>

<p>upward-pointing triangles.</p>

<p>The downward-pointing triangles can be counted by their by their bottom vertices, but it’s a bit messier. First, each vertex not on the left or right edge of the figure is the bottom vertex of a triangle of height $1$, and there are $$\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}=\binom{n}2$$ of them. Each vertex that is not on the left or right edge or on the slant grid lines adjacent to those edges is the bottom vertex of a triangle of height $2$, and there are </p>

<p>$$\sum_{k=1}^{n-3}k=\binom{n-2}2$$ of them. In general each vertex that is not on the left or right edge or on one of the $h-1$ slant grid lines nearest each of those edges is the bottom vertex of a triangle of height $h$, and there are </p>

<p>$$\sum_{k=1}^{n+1-2h}k=\binom{n+2-2h}2$$ of them. </p>

<p><strong>Algebra beyond this point corrected.</strong></p>

<p>The total number of downward-pointing triangles is therefore</p>

<p>$$\begin{align*}
\sum_{h\ge 1}\binom{n+2-2h}2&amp;=\sum_{k=0}^{\lfloor n/2\rfloor-1}\binom{n-2k}2\\
&amp;=\frac12\sum_{k=0}^{\lfloor n/2\rfloor-1}(n-2k)(n-2k-1)\\
&amp;=\frac12\sum_{k=0}^{\lfloor n/2\rfloor-1}\left(n^2-4kn+4k^2-n+2k\right)\\
&amp;=\left\lfloor\frac{n}2\right\rfloor\binom{n}2+2\sum_{k=0}^{\lfloor n/2\rfloor-1}k^2-(2n-1)\sum_{k=0}^{\lfloor n/2\rfloor-1}k\\
&amp;=\left\lfloor\frac{n}2\right\rfloor\binom{n}2+\frac13\left\lfloor\frac{n}2\right\rfloor\left(\left\lfloor\frac{n}2\right\rfloor-1\right)\left(2\left\lfloor\frac{n}2\right\rfloor-1\right)\\
&amp;\qquad\qquad-\frac12(2n-1)\left\lfloor\frac{n}2\right\rfloor\left(\left\lfloor\frac{n}2\right\rfloor-1\right)\;.
\end{align*}$$</p>

<p>Set $\displaystyle m=\left\lfloor\frac{n}2\right\rfloor$, and this becomes</p>

<p>$$\begin{align*}
&amp;m\binom{n}2+\frac13m(m-1)(2m-1)-\frac12(2n-1)m(m-1)\\
&amp;\qquad\qquad=m\binom{n}2+m(m-1)\left(\frac{2m-1}3-n+\frac12\right)\;.

<p>Also you can a very good grip of the basic mathematical concepts by programming them (e.g. algorithms to convert between bases, factoring quadratics, finding square roots by newtons method when you get to calculus) - if you are just programming for programmings sake you will probably not learn very much mathematics (or at least, most of that which you do learn is by accident), but if you do it as an act of <em>detailed explanation</em> it can be an excellent process to find much clearer understanding of whatever it is you're learning about (and as a bonus you can run them to automatically solve problems that you already know how to do!).</p>

<li>50K - 70K - 20% = 4K in taxes</li>
<li>70K - $90K - 30% = 6K in taxes</li>
<li>90K and up - 40% = 4K in taxes</li>

<p>So the net salary would be 81K.</p>

<p>However, knowing only the net salary (81K) and the tax brackets (1-4) how can I find out what was the gross salary?</p>

<p>Thank you very much.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Would the same rules apply if I have 2 level of brackets? For instance Federal and State income tax. Lets assume that the brackets are the same and Federal and State charge you the same amount on yeah tax bracket.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong> Actually I will combine Federal and State tax into one set of brackets and apply the same rule as it was one set of brackets.</p>
","<p>First, determine the maximum net for each bracket:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If your gross is 0-50,000, then your net is 0-45,000.</p></li>
<li><p>If your gross is 50,001-70,000, then your net is 45,001-61,000 (the most you will pay in taxes is 5,000 for the first 50,000, and 4,000 for the next 20,000).</p></li>
<li><p>If your gross is 70,001-90,000, then your net is 61,001-75,000 (the most you will pay in taxes is 5,000 for the first 50,000, 4,000 for the next 20,000, and 6,000 for the final 20,000, for a total of 15,000 in taxes).</p></li>
<li><p>If your gross is 90,001 and up, your net is 75,001 and up.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So, if the net salary is 81,000, then you are in the final bracket. You've earned 75,000 for the first 90,000; and you've earned a further 6,000 more <em>net</em>. </p>

<p>If $x$ is the amount over 90,000 that you earned, then you know that $0.6x=6,000$ (since you keep 60% of the amount over 90,000). Solving for $x$ gives $x=\frac{6000}{0.6} = 10,000$, so the gross salary was $\$$100,000.</p>

<p>Indeed, if your gross is 100,000, then you pay 5,000 of the first 50,000 and keep 45,000; you pay 4,000 of the next 20,000, and keep 16,000 (you've paid 9,000 in taxes and kept 61,000 in net); you pay 6,000 of the next 20,000 in taxes, and keep 14,000 (your running total is 15,000 in taxes and 75,000 in net); and you pay 4,000 in taxes for the next 10,000 and keep 6,000 (your final total: 19,000 in taxes, 81,000 in net).</p>

This corresponds to a gross salary in the 70,000-90-000 bracket; it is exactly 6,500 over the final net if you made 70,000, so if $x$ is the amount over 70,000, as you pay 30% of $x$ in taxes you must have $6,500=0.7x$.

<p>but then i find this; derivation of $\sin{x}\rightarrow \cos{x}$</p>

<p>why we cant use $\sin{x}$ itself to solve the equation. whats the purpose of using its derivative $\cos{x}$.
Please forgive me if i have asked a stupid questions, i want to improve my fundamentals in calculus.</p>
","<p>My example is from the real life situation of war. From experiments in physics we know that the acceleration due to gravity of a particle near the Earth's surface is about $-9.8 \frac{m}{s^2}$. </p>

<p>If you're an artilleryman in an army, you want your artillery shells to hit the enemy, or else theirs may hit you and kill you (game over). So you need to know how to angle your artillerygun and which direction to point it in so that when the shell lands, it blows up your enemy (rather than missing). </p>

<p>All you know is that you can control the direction your cannon points and the angle you fire it in in the air -- after it's fired gravity takes over and that $-9.8 \frac{m}{s^2}$ takes over the situation.</p>

<p>Calculus shows us that if $x(t)$ is the function representing the position of the artillery shell at time $t$, then its first derivative is the shell's velocity and its second derivative is the shell's acceleration. We know acceleration from physics (it's that $-9.8 \frac{m}{s^2}$ we had earlier)! We write this as $x''(t) = -9.8 \frac{m}{s^2}$. </p>

<p>From this equation (involving derivatives) you can calculate (using ""integration"") the position function $x(t)$ of the particle given the direction you fire it in and the angle you fire it at. </p>

<p>Why do you care about that? Because knowing $x(t)$ will tell you where your shell lands and thus whether your shot will kill the enemy or not. So you can do a quick calculation to determine which direction and which angle to fire in to ensure that your shell hits your target. The side that does this computation first and gets the shell in the air first will kill the other side, helping win the war.</p>

There are $n^m$ functions of all kinds from $\Bbb A$ to $\Bbb B$. If $b\in\Bbb B$, there are $(n-1)^m$ functions from $\Bbb A$ to $\Bbb B\setminus\{b\}$, i.e., functions whose ranges do not include $b$. We need to subtract these from the original $n^m$, and we need to do it for each of the $n$ members of $\Bbb B$, so a better approximation is $n^m-n(n-1)^m$.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, a function whose range misses <strong>two</strong> members of $\Bbb B$ gets subtracted twice in that computation, and it should be subtracted only once. Thus, we have to add back in the functions whose ranges miss at least two points of $\Bbb B$. If $b_0,b_1\in\Bbb B$, there are $(n-2)^m$ functions from $\Bbb A$ to $\Bbb B\setminus\{b_0,b_1\}$, and there are $\binom{n}{2}$ pairs of points of $\Bbb B$, so we have to add back in $\binom{n}2(n-2)^m$ to get</p>

<p>$$n^m-n(n-1)^m+\binom{n}2(n-2)^m\;,$$</p>

<p>which can be expressed more systematically as</p>

<p>$$\binom{n}0n^m-\binom{n}1(n-1)^m+\binom{n}2(n-2)^m\;.$$</p>

"Can someone explain Gödel's incompleteness theorems in layman terms?","51874","","<p>Can you explain it in a fathomable way at high school level?</p>
","<p>The problem with Godel's incompleteness is that it is <em>so</em> open for exploitations and problems once you don't do it completely right. You can prove and disprove the existence of god using this theorem, as well the correctness of religion and its incorrectness against the correctness of science. The number of horrible arguments carried out in the name of Godel's incompleteness theorem is so large that we can't even count them all.</p>

<p>But if I were to give the theorem in a nutshell I would say that if we have a list of axioms which we can enumerate with a computer, and these axioms are sufficient to develop the basic laws of arithmetics, then our list of axioms cannot be both consistent and complete.</p>

<p>In other words, if our axioms are consistent then in every model of the axioms there is a statement which is true but not provable.</p>

<hr>

<p>Caveats:</p>

<ol>
<li>Enumerate with a computer means that we can write a program (on an ideal computer) which goes over the possible strings in our alphabet and identify the axioms on our list. The fact the computer is ""ideal"" and not bound by physical things like electricity, etc. is important. Moreover if you are talking to high school kids which are less familiar with theoretical concepts like that, it might be better to talk about them at first. Or find a way to avoid that.</li>
<li>By basic laws of arithmetics I mean the existence of successor function, addition and multiplication. The usual symbols may or may not be in the language over which our axioms are written in. This is another fine point which a lot of people skip over, because it's usually clear to mathematician (although not always), but for high school level crowd it might be worth pointing out that we need to be able to define these operations and prove they behave normally to some extent, but we don't have to have them in our language.</li>
<li>It's very important to talk about what is ""provable"" and what is ""true"", the latter being within the context of a specific structure. That's something that professional mathematician can make mistakes with, especially those less trained with the distinction of provable and true (while still doing classical mathematics, rather some intuitionistic or constructive mathematics).</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>Now, I would probably try to keep it simple. <strong>VERY</strong> simple. I'd talk about the integers in their standard model, and I would explain the incompleteness theorem within the context of <em>this particular model</em>, with a very specified language including all the required symbols.</p>

<p>In this case we can simple say that if $T$ is a list of axioms in our language which we can enumerate by an ideal computer, and all the axioms of $T$ are true in $\Bbb N$, then there is some statement $\varphi$ which is true in $\Bbb N$ but there is no proof from $T$ to the statement $\varphi$.</p>

","<p>There are a few good answers to this question, depending on the audience. I've used all of these on occasion.</p>

<p><strong>A way to solve polynomials</strong></p>

<p>We came up with equations like $x - 5 = 0$, what is $x$?, and the naturals solved them (easily). Then we asked, ""wait, what about $x + 5 = 0$?"" So we invented negative numbers. Then we asked ""wait, what about $2x = 1$?"" So we invented rational numbers. Then we asked ""wait, what about $x^2 = 2$?"" so we invented irrational numbers.</p>

<p>Finally, we asked, ""wait, what about $x^2 = -1$?"" This is the only question that was left, so we decided to invent the ""imaginary"" numbers to solve it. All the other numbers, at some point, didn't exist and didn't seem ""real"", but now they're fine. Now that we have imaginary numbers, we can solve every polynomial, so it makes sense that that's the last place to stop.</p>

<p><strong>Pairs of numbers</strong></p>

<p>This explanation goes the route of redefinition. Tell the listener to forget everything he or she knows about imaginary numbers. You're defining a new number system, only now there are always pairs of numbers. Why? For fun. Then go through explaining how addition/multiplication work. Try and find a good ""realistic"" use of pairs of numbers (many exist).</p>

<p>Then, show that in this system,  $(0,1) * (0,1) = (-1,0)$, in other words, we've defined a new system, under which it makes sense to say that $\sqrt{-1} = i$, when $i=(0,1)$. And that's really all there is to imaginary numbers: a definition of a new number system, which makes sense to use in most places. And under that system, there <strong>is</strong> an answer to $\sqrt{-1}$.</p>

<p><strong>The historical explanation</strong></p>

<p>Explain the history of the imaginary numbers. Showing that mathematicians <em>also</em> fought against them for a long time helps people understand the mathematical process, i.e., that it's all definitions in the end.</p>

<p>I'm a little rusty, but I think there were certain equations that kept having parts of them which used $\sqrt{-1}$, and the mathematicians kept  throwing out the equations since there is no such thing.</p>

<p>Then, one mathematician decided to just ""roll with it"", and kept working, and found out that all those square roots cancelled each other out.</p>

<p>Amazingly, the answer that was left was the <strong>correct answer</strong> (he was working on finding roots of polynomials, I think). Which lead him to think that there <em>was</em> a valid reason to use $\sqrt{-1}$, even if it took a long time to understand it.</p>

<p>Thanks guys!</p>
","<p><strong>Without Replacement:</strong> You shuffle the deck thoroughly, take out <strong>three</strong> cards. For this particular problem, the question is ""What is the probability these cards are all Kings.""</p>

<p><strong>With Replacement:</strong> Shuffle the deck, pick out <strong>one</strong> card, record what you got. Then put it <strong>back in the deck</strong>, shuffle, pick out one card, record what you got. Then put it back in the deck, pick out one card, record what you got. One might then ask for the probability that all three recorded cards were Kings. In the with replacement situation, it is possible, for example, to get the $\spadesuit$ King, or the $\diamondsuit$ Jack more than once.   </p>

<p>For solving the ""without replacement"" problem, here are a couple of ways. There are $\binom{52}{3}$ equally likely ways to choose $3$ cards. There are $\binom{4}{3}$ ways to choose $3$ Kings. So our probability is $\binom{4}{3}/\binom{52}{3}$.</p>

<p>Or else imagine taking out the cards one at a time. The probability the first card taken out was a King is $\frac{4}{52}$.  <strong>Given</strong> that the first card taken out was a King, the probability the second one was  is $\frac{3}{51}$, since there are $51$ cards left of which $3$ are Kings. So the probability the first two cards were Kings is $\frac{4}{52}\cdot\frac{3}{51}$. **Given that the first two were Kings, the probability the third is is $\frac{2}{50}$. So the desired probability is $\frac{4}{52}\cdot\frac{3}{51}\cdot \frac{2}{50}$. </p>

<p><strong>Remark:</strong> We could solve the same three Kings problem under the ""with replacement"" condition. (You were not asked to do that,) The second approach we took above yields the answer $\left(\frac{4}{52}\right)^3$. Since we are replacing the card each time and shuffling, the probability of what the ""next"" card is is not changed by the knowledge that the first card was a King. </p>

","<p>Vectors, in general, can't be inverted under matrix multiplication, as only square matricies can inverses. However, in the situation you've described, it's possible to compute $c$ anyway, assuming the equation is satisfied for some $c$. If we multiply both sides by $X^T$, the result is $x^T B^{-1} (x-\mu) = x^T x c = |x|^2 c$. Assuming x is not the zero vector (in which case any $c$ will still have $xc=0$ so any choice of $c$ should work), we just get $c= \frac{1}{|x|^2} x^T B^{-1} (x-\mu)$.</p>

<p>I must caution that the expression above for $c$ is defined even when there is no solution of the original equation, which will be almost all of the time for randomly generated vectors and matrices. Hence, if you are going to use it, you should check that this works by plugging what you get for $c$ back into the original expression and see if it works. Also, the choice of $x^T \over |x|^2$ is not unique; any row vector $v$ such that $vx=1$ will work equally well in the above expression.</p>

<p>apparently you must use the product rule and the chain rule but I'm totally confused on how to get the answer...</p>
","<p>You want the derivative of $f(x)= (2x-3)^4 (x^2+x+1)^5$. Take it one step at a time. If you were evaluating $f(x)$ for a particular value of $x$, the <strong>last</strong> calculation that you’d make is multiplying $(2x-3)^4$ and $(x^2+x+1)^5$, so that product is the <strong>first</strong> thing to take care of in the differentiation. Apply the product rule:</p>

<p>$$f\,'(x)=(2x-3)^4\left[(x^2+x+1)^5\right]'+\left[(2x-3)^4\right]'(x^2+x+1)^5\;.$$</p>

<p>Now you have to take the derivatives $\left[(x^2+x+1)^5\right]'$ and $\left[(2x-3)^4\right]'$. Each of these is the derivative of a power, so use the power rule. But they are not powers of $x$, so you’ll also need the chain rule:</p>

<p>$$\left[(x^2+x+1)^5\right]'=5(x^2+x+1)^4\left[x^2+x+1\right]'\;,$$</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>$$\left[(2x-3)^4\right]'=4(2x-3)^3\left[2x-4\right]'\;.$$</p>

<p>All that’s left is to differentiate the polynomials $x^2+x+1$ and $2x-4$, getting $2x+1$ and $2$, respectively. Now put the pieces back together:</p>

<p>$$\begin{align*}
f\,'(x)&amp;=(2x-3)^4\left[(x^2+x+1)^5\right]'+\left[(2x-3)^4\right]'(x^2+x+1)^5\\

<p>That’s a perfectly reasonable answer, but you could also pull out a bunch of common factors and write it as</p>

<p>Also, find all vertical asymptotes and justify your answer by computing both (left/right) limits for each asymptote.</p>

<p>MY ANSWER so far..</p>

<p>For the Horizontal asymptote, I simply looked at the coefficients for both the numerator and the denominator. Both are $1$ so $\frac{1}{1}$ gives me $y=1$ as the Horizontal asymptote however I don't know how I would justify it with a limit. If i take the limit of $f(x)$, what will $x$ approach? $\infty$ or $-\infty$?</p>

<p>For the vertical asymtote, I set the denominator equal to $0$ and got $x=5$ and $x=1$ as the vertical asymptotes. However, I dont know how I would justify my answer using limits..</p>
","<p>A better way to justify that the only horizontal asymptote is at $y = 1$ is to observe that:
$$
\lim_{x \to -\infty} f(x) = \lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = 1
$$
There is indeed a vertical asymptote at $x = 5$. To justify this, we can use either of the following two facts:
\begin{align*}
\lim_{x \to 5^-} f(x) &amp;= -\infty \\
\lim_{x \to 5^+} f(x) &amp;= \infty \\
\end{align*}
Note that there is no vertical asymptote at $x = 1$; instead, the discontinuity here is just a hole. Indeed, notice that:
$$
\lim_{x \to 1} \frac{x^2-x}{x^2-6x+5}
= \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{x(x - 1)}{(x - 1)(x - 5)}

"How can a probability density be greater than one and integrate to one","50602","","<p>Wikipedia says:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>and it also says.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unlike a probability, a probability density function can take on values greater than one; for example, the uniform distribution on the interval $[0, \frac{1}{2}]$ has probability density $f(x) = 2$ for $0 ≤ x ≤ \frac{1}{2}$ and $f(x) = 0$ elsewhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How are these two things compatible?</p>
","<p>Consider the uniform distribution on the interval from $0$ to $1/2$.  The value of the density is $2$ on that interval, and $0$ elsewhere.  The area under the graph is the area of a rectangle.  The length of the base is $1/2$, and the height is $2$
$$
\int\text{density} = \text{area of rectangle} = \text{base} \cdot\text{height} = \frac 12\cdot 2 = 1.

<p>More generally, if the density has a large value over a small region, then the probability is comparable to the value times the size of the region.  (I say ""comparable to"" rather than ""equal to"" because the value my not be the same at all points in the region.)  The probability within the region must not exceed $1$.  A large number---much larger than $1$---multiplied by a small number (the size of the region) can be less than $1$ if the latter number is small enough.</p>

(Instead of 2).</p>

<p>I thought I understood the problem but I guess not since I have no idea how to do it with 3.</p>
","<p>The birthday problem with 2 people is quite easy because finding the probability of the complementary event ""all birthdays distinct"" is straightforward. For 3 people, the complementary event includes ""all birthdays distinct"", ""one pair and the rest distinct"", ""two pairs and the rest distinct"", etc. To find the exact value is pretty complicated. </p>

<p>The Poisson approximation is pretty good, though. Imagine checking every triple and calling it a ""success"" if all three have the same birthdays. The total number of successes is approximately Poisson with mean value ${30 \choose 3}/365^2$. Here $30\choose 3$ is the number of triples, and $1/365^2$ is the chance that any particular triple is a success.
The probability of getting at least one success is obtained from the Poisson distribution:
$$ P(\mbox{ at least one triple birthday with 30 people})\approx 1-\exp(-{30 \choose 3}/365^2)=.0300. $$     </p>

<p>You can modify this formula for other values, changing either 30 or 3. For instance, 
$$ P(\mbox{ at least one triple birthday with 100 people})\approx 1-\exp(-{100 \choose 3}/365^2)=.7029,$$
$$ P(\mbox{ at least one double birthday with 25 people })\approx 1-\exp(-{25 \choose 2}/365)=.5604.$$</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Find the area of the largest rectangle that can be inscribed in the ellipse 
  $$\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1.$$</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I got as far as coming up with the equation for the area to be $A=4xy$ but then when trying to find the derivative I don't think I'm doing it right. </p>
","<p>Suppose that the upper righthand corner of the rectangle is at the point $\langle x,y\rangle$. Then you know that the area of the rectangle is, as you say, $4xy$, and you know that $$\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1\;.\tag{1}$$</p>

<p>Thinking of the area as a function of $x$, we have $$\frac{dA}{dx}=4x\frac{dy}{dx}+4y\;.$$ Differentiating $(1)$ with respect to $x$, we have</p>

<p>$$\frac{2x}{a^2}+\frac{2y}{b^2}\frac{dy}{dx}=0\;,$$ so $$\frac{dy}{dx}=-\frac{b^2x}{a^2y}\;,$$ and $$\frac{dA}{dx}=4y-\frac{4b^2x^2}{a^2y}\;.$$</p>

<p>Setting this to $0$ and simplifying, we have $y^2=\dfrac{b^2x^2}{a^2}$. From $(1)$ we know that $$y^2=b^2-\frac{b^2x^2}{a^2}\;.$$ Thus, $y^2=b^2-y^2$, $2y^2=b^2$, and $\dfrac{y^2}{b^2}=\dfrac12$. Clearly, then, $\dfrac{x^2}{a^2}=\dfrac12$ as well, and the area is maximized when</p>

","<p>I don't think calculating the angle between two lines will help you to find the equation of the line of intersection of two lines.</p>

<p>It should be clear that the line of intersection is the line which is perpendicular to the normal of both the given planes.</p>

"Derivative of a Delta function","50285","","<p>I know questions similar to this one have been asked, but there is a particular aspect that I'm confused about that wasn't addressed in the answers to the other ones. I'm dealing with an expression which I have simplified into something like
\begin{equation}f(D)\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} dk\, e^{-ikx}\end{equation} Where $D=\frac{d}{dx}$
The integral is simply a Dirac delta $\delta(x)$, and from what little I know about distributions I know that derivatives of delta functions only make sense when they appear inside an integral. This isn't the case here though, so I'm not sure how to proceed. I've seen some identities here and there such as $\frac{d}{dx}\delta (x)=-\frac{\delta(x)}{x}$ and other similar ones and I'm not sure how to interpret them. 
Any help on this would be greatly appreciated. </p>
","<p>With suitable interpretation (!), it is perfectly ok to compute as
$$
{d\over dx}\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{itx}\;dt \;=\; 
 \int_{-\infty}^\infty {d\over dx}e^{itx}\;dt
\;=\; \int_{-\infty}^\infty it\cdot e^{itx}\;dt
$$
(Faux-secretly, the integral is the Fourier transform being taken as <em>tempered</em> _distribution_, and not as limit of Riemann sums...) In this example, one must be prepared to recognize the outcome (which, as numerical integral diverges, of course) as simply the derivative of Dirac delta, just as the original was Dirac delta itself.</p>

<p>While it is true that $\delta$ does not have a pointwise value at $0$, it certainly does have pointwise values <em>away</em> from $0$. For that matter, before people decided to formalize ""function"" as something that should have pointwise values, Euler and many others often treated ""function"" as sometimes meaning ""expression"". Meanwhile, an $L^2$ function doesn't really have pointwise values, so in some sense is worse off than $\delta$. </p>

<p>Fourier inversion on $L^2(\mathbb R)$ would seem to involve integrals that needn't converge, but with Plancherel's theorem in hand, we continue to write those integrals, but disclaim that the notation must be understood as meaning the extension-by-continuity from a smaller space.</p>

<p>I think much of the point of distribution theory is to be able to treat distributions not merely as functionals on classical functions, but as <em>generalized</em> functions, permitting the same operations, if extended suitably.</p>

<p>Operations such as dilation and translation are more easily notated by using ""argument"" notation $x\to \delta(x-y)$, although, yes, it is risky to too hastily assume that generalized functions share all the properties of classical ones.</p>

<p>Further, the first round of distribution theory is not the end of the story, even to make best legitimate use of $\delta$. Namely, a finer gradation of ""distributions"" (and classical functions) is very often useful, as measure of how far a generalized function is from being $L^2$ or continuous, etc. Thus, one can ""predict"" that a solution $u$ to an equation $u''+q(x)u=\delta$ (for smooth $q$, say) will be <em>continuous</em>.</p>

<p>I only recently learned that Dirac's original intuitive use of $\delta$ did actually resemble what would now be formalized as a ""Gelfand triple"" $H^{+1}\subset L^2\subset H^{-1}$ of Levi-Sobolev spaces on $\mathbb R$, where $\delta$ lies in $H^{-1}$ but not quite in $L^2$. Thus, general distribution theory made $\delta$ ""legal"", but in itself did not yet manage to account for Dirac's marvelous intuition.</p>

<p>(Yes, nowadays standard coursework teaches us to have a sometimes-too-narrow viewpoint, providing an excuse to merely dismiss good ideas as ""unrigorous"" rather than figuring out how to legitimize them. The utility of Heaviside's and Dirac's ""non-rigorous"" ideas out-weighed the difficulty of justification in everyone's eyes except mathematicians, perhaps. That is, if you seem to always be able to ""get the right answer"" (with physical corroboration), it's hard to take seriously an objection that one wasn't playing fair, all the more when ""fair"" is according to rules that were made up by someone.)</p>

<p>The above results obtained by modifying the two matlab functions already mentioned in this question.</p>
","<p>theoretically assuming that the calculations are done in a infinite arithmetic then <strong>the polynomials are the same</strong> so they give the <strong>same answer</strong> .</p>

<p><strong>But</strong> since the computer and applied arithmetic are finite then when calculating the polynomials they do no turn out to be equal (at least not in all the cases). and note that the more arithmetic operations you do the more you loose accuracy!</p>

<p>so if the input x is closer to $ x_i $ (one of the data we already have); then choosing $x_i$ as $x_0$ gives a better accuracy if we are using the forward differences formula in our finite arithmetic system .(or in the case of back ward differences choosing $x_i$ as $x_n$)
(or even in the case of Centered Differences choosing $x_i$ as the middle data)</p>

<p><strong>since</strong></p>

<p>e.g. in the case of $x_i$ as $x_0$ using the forward differences formula ; the $f(x_0)$ is a single term (with no additional arithmetic to loose accuracy like other terms) and since we are assuming that if x is close to $x_i$ then $f(x)$ is also close to $f(x_i)$. 
so we get the least possible error in calculating $f(x)$.(which is also the case for Centered Differences and back ward differences).</p>

<p><strong>Additional notes:</strong></p>

<p>if we use the newton's divided differences formula then indexing the data really does not matter . so to raise the accuracy we simply re-index the data the way its more accurate and find the polynomial. </p>

<p>BUT if we are using the assumption that $x_{i+1} - x_{i} = h$(where h is the step size).</p>

<p>then we cannot re-index the data as we wish an the data should be either increasing or decreasing .so to get more accuracy and to be able to choose the single term ($f(x_{0})$ or $f(x_{n})$ or ...) to be the closest data;
we need to change the polynomial formula to meet our needs.  </p>

"De-Morgan's theorem for 3 variables?","49031","","<p>The most relative that I found on Google for <code>de morgan's 3 variable</code> was: (ABC)' = A' + B' + C'.</p>

<p>I didn't find the answer for my question, therefore I'll ask here:</p>

<p>What is De-Morgan's theorem for <code>(A + B + C)'</code>?</p>
","<p>DeMorgan's Theorem applied to $(A + B + C)'$ is as follows:</p>

<p>$$(A + B + C)' = A'B'C'{}{}{}{}$$</p>

<p>We have $\;\;$NOT(A or B or C) $\;\equiv\;$ Not(A) and Not(B) and Not(C),</p>

<p>which in boolean-algebra equates to $A'B'C'$</p>

<p>Both these extensions from DeMorgan's defined for two variables can be justified precisely because we can apply DeMorgan's in a nested manner, and in so doing, reapply, etc, in the end, it is equivalent to an immediate extension of it's application to three variables (or more) variables, provided they are connected by the same connective, $\land, \lor$.</p>

<p>For example, we can write $(A+B+C)' \equiv \big(A + (B+C)\big)' \equiv \big(A' \cdot (B+C)'\big) \equiv A'\cdot (B'C') \equiv A'B'C'$.  </p>

<hr>

<p>Indeed, provided we have a negated series of multiple variables all connected by the <em>SAME</em> connective (all and'ed or all or'ed), we can generalize DeMorgan's to even more than three variables, again, due to the associativity of AND and OR connectives. For any  arbitrary finite number of connected variables:</p>

<p>So, $$(ABCDEFGHIJ)' = A' + B' + C' + \cdots + H' + I' + J'$$</p>

<p>P.S.: Thanks all of you. Time for me to start studying.</p>
","<p>This is a recapitulation and extension of what we talked about in chat.</p>

<p>Whatever you do, I recommend that you try a variety of areas in order to find out what you like best. Don’t feel obliged to stick to the most common ones, either; for instance, if you find that you’ve a taste for set theory, give it a try. </p>

<p>My own interests are outside the undergraduate mainstream, so in mainstream areas others can probably give better recommendations. I do know that you’re working through Herstein for algebra; although it’s a little old-fashioned, it’s still a fine book, and anyone who can do the harder problems in it is doing well. </p>

<p>You mentioned that you’d prefer books and notes that are freely available. The revised version of Judy Roitman’s <em>Introduction to Modern Set Theory</em> is pretty good and is available <a href=""http://www.math.ku.edu/~roitman/stb3fullWeb.pdf"">here</a> as a PDF. You can also get it <a href=""http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/introduction-to-modern-set-theory-judith-roitman/1101201141?ean=9780982406243&amp;itm=1&amp;usri=set%252btheory%252broitman"">from Barnes &amp; Noble</a> for $8.99. <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0824779150""><em>Introduction to Set Theory</em></a> by Hrbacek &amp; Jech is also good, but it’s not freely available (or at least not legitimately so). </p>

<p>I’ve not seen a freely available topology text that I like; in particular, I’m not fond of Morris, <a href=""http://www.topologywithouttears.net/topbook.pdf""><em>Topology Without Tears</em></a>, though I’ve certainly seen worse. If you’re willing to spend a little and like the idea of a book that proves only the hardest results and leaves the rest to the reader, you could do a lot worse than John Greever’s <em>Theory and Examples of Point-Set Topology</em>. It’s out of print, but <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000E7S2UE"">Amazon</a> has several very inexpensive used copies. (This book was designed for use in a course taught using the so-called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_method"">Moore method</a>. It’s excellent for self-study <strong>if</strong> you have someone available to answer questions if you get stuck, but SE offers exactly that. In the interests of full disclosure I should probably mention that I first learned topology from this book when it was still mimeographed typescript.) If I were to pick a single undergraduate topology book to serve both as a text and a reference, it would probably be <em>Topology</em>, by James Munkres, but I don’t believe that it’s (legitimately) freely available. You might instead consider Stephen Willard, <em>General Topology</em>; it’s at a very slightly higher level than the Munkres, but it’s also well-written, and the <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0486434796"">Dover edition</a> is very inexpensive.</p>

<p>I can’t speak to its quality, but Robert B. Ash has a first-year graduate algebra text available <a href=""http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~r-ash/Algebra.html"">here</a>; it includes solutions to the exercises, and it introduces some topics not touched by Herstein. He has some other texts available from <a href=""http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~r-ash/"">this page</a>; the algebra ones are more advanced graduate level texts, but the complex analysis text requires only a basic real analysis or advanced calculus course.</p>

<p><a href=""http://people.math.gatech.edu/~cain/textbooks/onlinebooks.html"">This page</a> has links to quite a collection of freely available math books, including several real analysis texts; I’ve not looked at them, so I can’t make any very confident recommendations, but if nothing else there may be some useful ancillary texts there. I will say that <a href=""http://www.trillia.com/zakon-analysisI.html"">this analysis text</a> by Elias Zakon and the companion second volume look pretty decent at first glance. For that matter, the intermediate-level book on number theory by Leo Moser available <a href=""http://www.trillia.com/moser-number.html"">here</a> looks pretty good, too, apart from having very few exercises. Oh, come to think of it there is one real analysis book that I want to mention: DePree and Swartz, <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0471853917""><em>Introduction to Real Analysis</em></a>, if only for its wonderful introduction to the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henstock%E2%80%93Kurzweil_integral"">gauge integral</a>.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Is there a formula you can use to create a derivative of this game with different numbers of symbols displayed on each card.</p>

<p>Assuming the following variables:</p>

<ul>
<li>S = total number of symbols</li>
<li>C = total number of cards</li>
<li>N = number of symbols per card</li>
</ul>

<p>Can you mathematically demonstrate the minimum number of cards (C) and symbols (S) you need based on the number of symbols per card (N)?</p>
","<p>The celebrated Ray-Chaudhuri–Wilson theorem states that $C \leq S$ (contradicting your numbers).</p>

<p>An almost matching construction is as follows. Pick some prime number $n$. Our universe, of size $n^2+n+1$, consists of pairs of numbers in $\{0,\ldots,n-1\}$ plus $n+1$ singletons $\{0,1,\ldots,n-1,\infty\}$ (""points at infinity""). For each $0 \leq a \leq n-1$ and $0 \leq b \leq n-1$ we will have a card of size $n+1$ containing the pairs $\{(x,ax+b \mod{n})\}$ and the singleton $a$. There are also $n$ special cards, for each $0 \leq c \leq n-1$, containing the pairs $\{(c,x)\}$ and the singleton $\infty$. One super special card contains all $n+1$ singletons.</p>

<p>Clearly two cards with the same $a$ intersect only at the singleton. Two cards with different $a$s intersect at the unique solution to $a_1x+b_1 = a_2x+b_2 \pmod{n}$. Two special cards intersect only at the singleton, and a normal and a special card intersect at $(c,ac+b)$. Finally, the super special card intersects the rest at a singleton.</p>

<p>In total, we have $n^2+n+1$ cards and symbols, each card containing $n+1$ symbols, and two cards intersecting at exactly one symbol. In your case $n=7$ and so the number of cards and symbols should be $7^2+7+1 = 57$.</p>

"Methods for showing three points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ are colinear (or not)","48578","","<p>A common question is to prove/disprove that three points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ are colinear.  For, example</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Show that $(-1, 8)$, $(1, -2)$ and $(2, 1)$ lie on a common line. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What are some methods one could use to answer questions of this nature?</p>
","<p>Since there seems to be some confusion as to the fit of $(-1,8)$ vs. $(-1,-8)$, try to use the other two points.</p>

<p>So say that point $a$ is $(x_1, y_1)$, point $b$ is $(x_2, y_2)$, and we'll start with the assumption that $x_1\neq x_2$.</p>

<p>The general ""two-point"" formula for the equation of a line (given two points) is given by:</p>

<p>$$(y - y_1) = \frac{(y_2 - y_1)} {(x_2 - x_1)} (x-x_1)\quad\quad\quad(1)$$ </p>

<p>where 
$$\frac{(y_2 - y_1)} {(x_2 - x_1)} = m $$</p>

<p>($m$ represents the slope of the line).  You the need to simplify the equation by solving for $y$ and putting the equation, e.g., in slope-intercept form: $y = mx + b$ where $b$ is the $y$-intercept (the value of $y$ when $x = 0$).  Then you need then to substitute the $x$-coordinate of the third point for $x$ in the equation, likewise for $y$.  If the result, after doing so, is not an equality, then the third point doesn't ""satisfy"" the equation; in other words, it is therefore not on the line.  </p>

<p>If $(-1,8)$ does not satisfy the equation of the line (such that after replacing $x$ and $y$ with the third point's coordinates, the two sides of the equation don't match, try using $(-1,-8)$, and if that works, you need to recheck the method you used to obtain the point $(-1,8)$.</p>

<p>Of course, you can also use the slope-intercept form, after computing the slope, as above:
$$y = mx + b$$
To solve for $b$, the $y$-intercept, simply evaluate the equation, putting $x = 0.$  That should give you $y = b$ (at $x = 0$): the point at which the line intersects the $y$-axis. </p>

<p><em>Caveat:</em></p>

<p>Now, suppose $x_1 = x_2$. Then what? We certainly cannot use the general two-point formulation given above, since if $x_1=x_2$, then $x_2 - x_1 = 0$, and division by zero is undefined.  What do you know about lines for which the slope is undefined?  </p>

<p>Such lines are always vertical lines, perpendicular to the $x$-axis, so every $x$-coordinate on such a line is identical. If we can rewrite the equation provided above in (1) as such:</p>

<p>$$(x_2 - x_1)(y - y_1) = (y_2 - y_1)(x-x_1)$$</p>

<p>The left side evaluates to $0$; simplifying gives us the equation $x = x_1.$</p>

<p>Recommendation: if this question is related to your studying for exams etc., it's important to understand how to compute the equation of a line, given two points, given the slope, and also how to easily move back and forth between such forms.</p>

<p>Please help me.</p>
","<p>We make a few comments only.  </p>

<p>$1.$ Note that $2\pi$ is a period of $\sin x$, or, equivalently, $1$ is a period of $\sin(2\pi x)$.  </p>

<p>But $\sin x$ has many other periods, such as $4\pi$, $6\pi$, and so on.  However, $\sin x$ has no (positive) period <em>shorter</em> than $2\pi$.</p>

<p>$2.$ If $p$ is a period of $f(x)$, and $H$ is <strong>any</strong> function, then $p$ is a period of $H(f(x))$.  So in particular, $2\pi$ is <em>a</em> period of $\sin^2 x$.  However, $\sin^2 x$ has a period which is smaller than $2\pi$, namely $\pi$. Note that $\sin(x+\pi)=-\sin x$, so $\sin^2(x+\pi)=\sin^2 x$. It turns out that $\pi$ is the shortest period of $\sin^2 x$.</p>

<p>$3.$ For sums and products,  the general situation is complicated. Let $p$ be a period of $f(x)$ and let $q$ be a period of $g(x)$. Suppose that there are positive integers $a$ and $b$ such that $ap=bq=r$. Then $r$ is a period of $f(x)+g(x)$, and also of $f(x)g(x)$.  </p>

<p>So for example, if $f(x)$ has $5\pi$ as a period, and $g(x)$ has $7\pi$ as a period, then $f(x)+g(x)$ and $f(x)g(x)$ each have $35\pi$ as a period.  However, even if $5\pi$ is the shortest period of $f(x)$ and $7\pi$ is the shortest period of $g(x)$, the number $35\pi$ need not be the shortest period of $f(x)+g(x)$ or $f(x)g(x)$. </p>

<p>We already had an example of this phenomenon: the shortest period of $\sin x$ is $2\pi$, while the shortest period of $(\sin x)(\sin x)$ is $\pi$.  Here is a more dramatic example. Let $f(x)=\sin x$, and $g(x)=-\sin x$.  Each function has smallest period $2\pi$.  But their sum is the $0$-function, which has every positive number $p$ as a period! </p>

<p>$4.$ If $p$ and $q$ are periods of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ respectively, then any common multiple of $p$ and $q$ is a period of $H(f(x), g(x))$ for <em>any</em> function $H(u,v)$, in particular when $H$ is addition and when $H$ is multiplication. So the least common multiple of $p$ and $q$, if it exists, is a period of $H(f(x),g(x))$. However, it need not be the <em>smallest</em> period.</p>

<p>$5.$ Periods can exhibit quite strange behaviour. For example, let $f(x)=1$ when $x$ is rational, and let $f(x)=0$ when $x$ is irrational. Then every positive rational $r$ is a period of $f(x)$.  In particular, $f(x)$ is periodic but has no shortest period. </p>

<p>$6.$ Quite often, the sum of two periodic functions is not periodic. For example, let $f(x)=\sin x+\cos 2\pi x$.  The first term has period $2\pi$, the second has period $1$. The sum is not a period. The problem is that $1$ and $2\pi$ are <em>incommensurable</em>. There do not exist positive integers $a$ and $b$ such that $(a)(1)=(b)(2\pi)$.  </p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
","<p>Probably the most straightforward method (to fully distinguish between the various possibilities) that I've seen is transforming the corresponding augmented matrix into row-reduced echelon form. In this case, you would start with: $$\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}1 &amp; 3 &amp; -1 &amp; -4\\4 &amp; -1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\\2 &amp; -1 &amp; -3 &amp; 1\end{array}\right]$$ Subtracting $4$ times the first row from the second, and $2$ times the first row from the third, we have: $$\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}1 &amp; 3 &amp; -1 &amp; -4\\0 &amp; -13 &amp; 6 &amp; 19\\0 &amp; -7 &amp; -1 &amp; 9\end{array}\right]$$ Subtracting $2$ times the third row from the second, we have: $$\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}1 &amp; 3 &amp; -1 &amp; -4\\0 &amp; 1 &amp; 8 &amp; 1\\0 &amp; -7 &amp; -1 &amp; 9\end{array}\right]$$ Adding $7$ times the second row to the third, we have: $$\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}1 &amp; 3 &amp; -1 &amp; -4\\0 &amp; 1 &amp; 12 &amp; 1\\0 &amp; 0 &amp; 55 &amp; 16\end{array}\right]$$</p>

<p>At this point, we have only zeroes below the main diagonal, but no zeroes on the diagonal, so a unique solution exists. Continuing to reduce until the $3\times 3$ portion of the augmented matrix is just the $3\times 3$ identity matrix, we have $$\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 3/11\\0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; -73/55\\0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 16/55\end{array}\right]$$ This tells us that $x=3/11,$ $y=-73/55,$ $z=16/55$ is the unique solution to the system.</p>

<hr>

<p>Let's consider another system: $$\begin{cases}x+3y-z=4\\4x-y+2z=8\\2x-7y+4z=0,\end{cases}$$ which has corresponding matrix $$\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}1 &amp; 3 &amp; -1 &amp; 4\\4 &amp; -1 &amp; 2 &amp; 8\\2 &amp; -7 &amp; 4 &amp; 0\end{array}\right]$$ Starting out the same way gets us $$\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}1 &amp; 3 &amp; -1 &amp; 4\\0 &amp; -13 &amp; 6 &amp; -8\\0 &amp; -13 &amp; 6 &amp; -8\end{array}\right],$$ and subtracting the second row from the third gives us $$\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}1 &amp; 3 &amp; -1 &amp; 4\\0 &amp; -13 &amp; 6 &amp; -8\\0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\end{array}\right].$$ Now we have only zeroes below the main diagonal, but we have a zero on the main diagonal, too. This tells us that either there are no solutions or there are infinitely-many. Continuing to row-reduce as much as possible gets us to $$\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}1 &amp; 0 &amp; 5/13 &amp; 28/13\\0 &amp; 1 &amp; -6/13 &amp; 8/13\\0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\end{array}\right].$$ Translated back into terms of $x,y,z$ this is the equivalent system $$\begin{cases}x+0y+\frac5{13}z=\frac{28}{13}\\0x+y-\frac6{13}z=\frac8{13}\\0x+0y+0z=0,\end{cases}$$ or alternatively $$\begin{cases}x=-\frac5{13}z+\frac{28}{13}\\y=\frac6{13}z+\frac8{13}\\0=0.\end{cases}$$ One of these equations is always true, so one of our variables can take on any value. We might as well let $z$ take on any value, at which point the other two equations will tell us the values that $x$ and $y$ must take. Hence, we have infinitely-many solutions. </p>

<p><strong>Upshot</strong>: We will have infinitely-many solutions whenever we end up with one or more rows of all $0$s as we reduce the augmented matrix.</p>

<hr>

<p>By contrast, if we'd started with the system $$\begin{cases}x+3y-z=4\\4x-y+2z=8\\2x-7y+4z=-3,\end{cases}$$ which has corresponding matrix $$\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}1 &amp; 3 &amp; -1 &amp; 4\\4 &amp; -1 &amp; 2 &amp; 8\\2 &amp; -7 &amp; 4 &amp; -3\end{array}\right],$$ then our reduction process will get us $$\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}1 &amp; 3 &amp; -1 &amp; 4\\0 &amp; -13 &amp; 6 &amp; -8\\0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -3\end{array}\right].$$ Translated back into terms of $x,y,z$ this is the equivalent system $$\begin{cases}x+3y+-z=4\\0x-13y+6z=-8\\0x+0y+0z=-3,\end{cases}$$ but there is no solution to the last equation, so no solution to the system.</p>

<p><strong>Upshot</strong>: We will have no solutions whenever we end up with one or more rows of all $0$s <em>except in the last column</em> as we reduce the augmented matrix.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Added</strong>: Simply taking the determinant of the unaugmented matrix of the system--meaning of $$\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 3 &amp; -1\\4 &amp; -1 &amp; 2\\2 &amp; -1 &amp; -3\end{bmatrix}$$ in the first example and of $$\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 3 &amp; -1\\4 &amp; -1 &amp; 2\\2 &amp; -7 &amp; 4\end{bmatrix}$$ in the other two examples--will give us part of the answer. If the determinant is $0$ (as in the second and third example), then the system either has no solution or infinitely-many, but we cannot (by this method alone) say which. Otherwise, the system has a unique solution, but we cannot (by this method alone) say what it might be. That's why I tend to prefer the first method I suggested, at least when dealing with only a few equations and a few variables: it tells us the whole story.</p>

"How do I exactly project a vector onto a subspace?","48096","","<p>I am trying to understand how - exactly - I go about projecting a vector onto a subspace.</p>

<p>Now, I know enough about linear algebra to know about projections, dot products, spans, etc etc, so I am not sure if I am reading too much into this, or if this is something that I have missed.</p>

<p>For a class I am taking, the proff is saying that we take a vector, and 'simply project it onto a subspace', (where that subspace is formed from a set of orthogonal basis vectors).</p>

<p>Now, I know that a subspace is really, at the end of the day, just a set of vectors. (That satisfy properties <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection_%28linear_algebra%29"">here</a>). I get that part - that its this set of vectors. So, how do I ""project a vector on this subspace""?</p>

<p>Am I projecting my one vector, (lets call it a[n]) onto ALL the vectors in this subspace? (What if there is an infinite number of them?)</p>

<p>For further context, the proff was saying that lets say we found a set of basis vectors for a signal, (lets call them b[n] and c[n]) then we would project a[n] onto its <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_subspace"">signal subspace</a>. We project a[n] onto the signal-subspace formed by b[n] and c[n]. Well, how is this done exactly?..</p>

<p>Thanks in advance, let me know if I can clarify anything!</p>

<p>P.S. I appreciate your help, and I would really like for the clarification to this problem to be somewhat 'concrete' - for example, something that I can show for myself over MATLAB. Analogues using 2-D or 3-D space so that I can visualize what is going on would be very much appreciated as well. </p>

<p>Thanks again.</p>
","<p>I will talk about orthogonal projection here.</p>

<p>When one projects a vector, say $v$, onto a subspace, you find the vector in the subspace which is ""closest"" to $v$. The simplest case is of course if $v$ is already in the subspace, then the projection of $v$ onto the subspace is $v$ itself.</p>

<p>Now, the simplest kind of subspace is a one dimensional subspace, say the subspace is $U = \operatorname{span}(u)$. Given an arbitrary vector $v$ not in $U$, we can project it onto $U$ by
$$v_{\| U} = \frac{\langle v , u \rangle}{\langle u , u \rangle} u$$
which will be a vector in $U$. There will be more vectors than $v$ that have the same projection onto $U$.</p>

<p>Now, let's assume $U = \operatorname{span}(u_1, u_2, \dots, u_k)$ and, since you said so in your question, assume that the $u_i$ are orthogonal. For a vector $v$, you can project $v$ onto $U$ by
$$v_{\| U} = \sum_{i =1}^k \frac{\langle v, u_i\rangle}{\langle u_i, u_i \rangle} u_i = \frac{\langle v , u_1 \rangle}{\langle u_1 , u_1 \rangle} u_1 + \dots + \frac{\langle v , u_k \rangle}{\langle u_k , u_k \rangle} u_k.$$</p>

"What exactly is steady-state solution?","47996","","<p>In solving differential equation, one encounters with steady-state solution. My textbook says that steady-state solution is the limit of solutions of (ordinary) differential equations when $t \rightarrow \infty$. But the steady-state solution is given as $f(t)$, and this means that the solution is a function of $t$ - so what is this $t$ being in limit?</p>
","<p>In different areas, steady state has slightly different meanings, so please be aware of that.</p>

<p>We want a theory to study the qualitative properties of solutions of differential equations, without solving the equations explicitly.</p>

<p>Moreover, we often want to know whether a certain property of these solutions remains unchanged if the system is subjected to various changes (often called perturbations).</p>

<p>It is very important to be able to study how sensitive the particular model is to small perturbations or changes of initial conditions and of various paramters.</p>

<p>This leads us to an area of DEQ called <strong>Stability Analysis</strong> using phase space methods and we would consider this for both autonomous and nonautonomous systems under the umbrella of the term equilibrium.</p>

<p><strong>Autonomous</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The equilibrium solution ${y}0$ of an autonomous system $y' = f(y)$ is said to be stable if for each number $\varepsilon$ $&gt;0$ we can find a number $\delta$ $&gt;0$ (depending on $\varepsilon$) such that if $\psi(t)$ is any solution of $y' = f(y)$ having $\Vert$ $\psi(t)$ $- {y_0}$ $\Vert$ $&lt;$ $\delta$, then the solution $\psi(t)$ exists for all $t \geq {t_0}$ and $\Vert$ $\psi(t)$ $- {y_0}$ $\Vert$ $&lt;$ $\varepsilon$ for  $t \geq {t_0}$ (where for convenience the norm is the Euclidean distance that makes neighborhoods spherical).</p>
  
  <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The equilibrium solution ${y_0}$ is said to be asymptotically stable if it is stable and if there exists a number ${\delta_0}$ $&gt; 0$ such that if $\psi(t)$ is any solution of $y' = f(y)$ having $\Vert$ $\psi(t)$ $- {y_0}$ $\Vert$ $&lt;$ ${\delta_0}$, then $\lim_{t\rightarrow+\infty}$ $\psi(t)$ = ${y_0}$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The equilibrium solution ${y_0}$ is said to be <strong>unstable</strong> if it is not stable.</p>

<p>Equivalent definitions can be written for the nonautonomous system $y' = f(t, y)$.</p>

<p>Now we can add notions of globally asymptoctically stable, regions of asymptotic stability and so forth.</p>

<p>From all of these definitions, we can write nice theorems about Linear and Almost Linear system by looking at eigenvalues and we can add notions of conditional stability.</p>

","<p>There's no super-fast way to determine if an arbitrary number is prime by hand. However, you can often quickly determine when a number <em>isn't</em> prime, which is often good enough, especially if you are only dealing with smallish numbers, as you often are in math competitions.</p>

<ul>
<li>If a number ends in 0, 2, 4, 5, 6 or 8 then it's not prime (except for 2 and 5)</li>
<li>If the sum of the digits is a multiple of 3, then the number is not prime (except for 3)</li>
</ul>

<p>Those two rules knock about nearly 75% of numbers.</p>

<p>For numbers below 100, the only false positives are $49=7^2$, $77=7\cdot 11$ and $91=7\cdot 13$ which you can learn.</p>

<h3>Divisibility by 7</h3>

<p>A number of the form $10x+y$ is divisible by 7 exactly when $x-2y$ is divisible by 7. This allows you to quickly reduce the size of a number until you reach a number that obviously is or isn't a multiple of 7. For example, consider $n=847 = 84\times 10 + 7$. Then $x-2y$ is $84 - 14 = 70$ which is obviously divisible by 7, so 847 is also divisible by 7.</p>

<h3>Divisibility by 11</h3>

<p>There is also a simple test for multiples of 11 - starting from the units place, add the first digit, subtract the next digit, add the next one and so on. If you end up with a negative number, treat it as positive. If the result is a multiple of 11, so is the original number.</p>

<p>For example, take $n=539$. You calculate $9-3+5=11$, which is a multiple of 11, and so 539 is a multiple of 11.</p>

<p>Using these rules to check for divisibility by 2, 3, 5, 7 and 11 the only false positive less than 200 is 169, which is easy to remember as it is $13^2$. The only false positives below 300 are $221=13\times 17$, $247=13\times 19$, $289=17^2$ and $299=13\times 23$.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Just for fun, here's a graph of how many false positives there are for a given upper bound. This chart shows that with four rules and a list of 13 exceptions, you can correctly find whether any number under 500 is prime or not in... probably 20-30 seconds?</p>

"Taking Seats on a Plane","47324","","<p>This is a neat little problem that I was discussing today with my lab group out at lunch. Not particularly difficult but interesting implications nonetheless</p>

<p>Imagine there are a 100 people in line to board a plane that seats 100. The first person in line realizes he lost his boarding pass so when he boards he decides to take a random seat instead. Every person that boards the plane after him will either take their ""proper"" seat, or if that seat is taken, a random seat instead.</p>

<p>Question: What is the probability that the last person that boards will end up in his/her proper seat.</p>

<p>Moreover, and this is the part I'm still pondering about. Can you think of a physical system that would follow this combinatorial statistics? Maybe a spin wave function in a crystal etc...</p>
","<p>This is a classic puzzle!</p>

<p>The answer is that the probability that the last person ends in up in his proper seat is exactly $\frac{1}{2}$</p>

<p>The reasoning goes as follows:</p>

<p>First observe that the fate of the last person is determined the moment either the first or the last seat is selected! This is because the last person will either get the first seat or the last seat. Any other seat will necessarily be taken by the time the last guy gets to 'choose'.</p>

<p>Since at each choice step, the first or last is equally probable to be taken, the last person will get either the first or last with equal probability: $\frac{1}{2}$.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nwvsN.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>How can I determine the length of $d$?</p>
","<p>Let $a=3.05,\ b=2.23.$ Then a parametric equation for the ellipse is $x=a\cos t,\ y=b \sin t.$ When $t=0$ the point is at $(a,0)=(3.05,0)$, the starting point of the arc on the ellipse whose length you seek. Now it's important to realize that the parameter $t$ is <em>not</em> the central angle, so you need to get the value of $t$ which corresponds to the top end of your arc. At that end you have $y/x=\tan 50$ (degrees). And in terms of $t$ you have $y/x=(b/a)\tan t$. Solving for $t$ then gives
$$t=t_1=\arctan \left( \frac{a}{b}\tan 50 \right).$$</p>

<p>[note I'd suggest using radians here, replacing the $50$ by $5\pi/18.$]</p>

<p>For the arclength use the general formula of integrating $\sqrt{x'^2+y'^2}$ for $t$ in the desired range. In your case $x'=-a \sin t,\ y'=b \cos t$, so that you are integrating
$$\sqrt{a^2 \sin^2t+b^2 \cos^2t}$$
with respect to $t$ from $0$ to the above $t_1$. There not being a simple closed form for the antiderivative (it's an ""elliptic integral), the simplest approach now would be to do the integral numerically. This seems the more appropriate in your problem as you only know $a,b$ to two decimals, apparently.</p>

<p>Am I right? However, I do not know what is normal and why there are P(5) and Q($-\frac{1}{2}$).</p>

<hr>

<p><strong><em>Thank you for your attention</em></strong></p>
","<p>For a plane defined by $ax + by + cz = d$ the normal (ie the direction which is perpendicular to the plane) is said to be $(a, b, c)$ (see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_(geometry)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a> for details). Note that this is a direction, so we can normalise it $\frac{(1,1,2)}{\sqrt{1 + 1 + 4}} = \frac{(3,3,6)}{\sqrt{9 + 9 + 36}}$, which means these two planes are parallel and we can write the normal as $\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}(1,1,2)$.</p>

<p>Now let us find two points on the planes. Let $y=0$ and $z = 0$, and find the corresponding $x$ values. For $C_1$ $x = 4$ and for $C_2$ $x = 6$. So we know $C_1$ contains the point $(4,0,0)$ and $C_2$ contains the point $(6,0,0)$.</p>

<p>The distance between these two points is $2$ and the direction is $(1,0,0)$. Now we now that this is not the shortest distance between these two points as $(1,0,0) \neq \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}(1,1,2)$ so the direction is not perpendicular to these planes. However, this is ok because we can use the dot product between $(1,0,0)$ and $\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}(1,1,2)$ to work out the proportion of the distance that is perpendicular to the planes.</p>

<p>$(1,0,0) \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}(1,1,2) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}$</p>

<p>So the distance between the two planes is $\frac{2}{\sqrt{6}}$.</p>

<p>The last part is to find the plane which is the same distance away from $C_2$ as $C_1$ but in the opposite direction. We know the normal must be the same, $\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}(1,1,2)$. Using this we can write $C_3: x + y+ 2z = a$ and determine $a$. When $y=0, z=0$ we moved from $(4,0,0) \rightarrow (6,0,0)$, so if we move the same distance again we go $(6,0,0) \rightarrow (8,0,0)$ and $(8,0,0)$ is on $C_3$. Therefore, $a = 8$. So finally the equation of the plane is,</p>

<p>$C_3: x + y + 2z = 8$</p>

<p>And we are done :)</p>

<p>Don't know the answers of other 2.</p>

<p>Correct me if I am wrong. Thanks!!!</p>
","<p>There are two possible answers to this depending of if the number can start with a 0 or not.</p>

<p>If it can then the number is $7 \times 6 \times 5 = 210$</p>

<p>However we don't usually write numbers with leading zeros. So assuming we don't allow a leading zero the answer is $6 \times 6 \times 5 = 180$</p>

<hr>

<p>How many of these are odd?</p>

<p>Lets consider picking the numbers in a special order</p>

<p>First we need to pick a 1, 3 or 5 so in our first draw for the final digit so we have a choice of 3. Next we pick our first digit which can be any thing apart from 0 or the number we have just picked making a choice of 5 and for our final draw the middle digit we can pick any of the 5 remaining digits making $3 \times 5 \times 5 = 75$</p>

<hr>

<p>Finally For the third one greater than 330 we have two ways to achieve this either draw a 4, 5 or 6 for the first digit then we don't care about the others making $3 \times 6 \times 5 = 90$</p>

<p>Alternatively we must draw a 3 for our first digit then 4, 5 or 6 for our second and finally any digit making $1 \times 3 \times 5 = 15$</p>

<p>Now since both of these groups have no overlap we can simply add them together to get $90 + 15 = 105$.  </p>

<p>Here's what I have so far:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The plane through $(0,-2,5)$ is $ax + b(y+z) + c(z-5) = 0$.

  <p>Now we know that the plane is perpendicular to $5x + 4y - 2z = 0$ and then it replaces $(x,y,z)$ with $(a,b,c)$ to get $$5a + 4b - 2c = 0. \tag{2}$$</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It continues from there saying to solve the two equations to get $\frac{a}{6} = \frac{b}{-22} = \frac{c}{-29}$.</p>

<p>I know how to solve it once it gets to this but I have absolutely no idea how they got to this step. </p>
","<p>The explanation is using these three facts:</p>

<ol>
<li>Two planes are perpendicular iff their normal vectors are perpendicular.</li>
<li>If the equation of a plane is $ax+by+cz=d$, then a normal vector to the plane is $(a,b,c)$.</li>
<li>Two vectors $(a,b,c)$ and $(d,e,f)$ are perpendicular iff $ad+be+cf=(a,b,c)\cdot(d,e,f)=0$.</li>
</ol>

<p>So when the book asserts that the plane given by $ax + b(y+2) + c(z-5) = 0$ is perpendicular to the plane $5x + 4y - 2z = 0$, it does so with the equation $5a+4b-2c=0$.</p>

<p>I first attempted this with the code that goes through every number up to 600851475143, tests its divisibility, and adds it to an array of prime factors, printing out the largest.</p>

<p>This is great for small numbers, but for large numbers it would take a VERY long time (and a lot of memory). </p>

<p>I don't want a straight up answer, but I'd like to be pointed toward resources or told what I need to learn to implement some of the algorithms I've seen around in my program.</p>
","<p>The thing with Project Euler is that there is usually an obvious brute-force method to do the problem, which will take just about <em>forever</em>. As the questions become more difficult, you will need to implement clever solutions.</p>

<p>One way you can solve this problem is to use a loop that always finds the smallest (positive integer) factor of a number. When the smallest factor of a number is that number, then you've found the greatest prime factor!</p>

<p><em>Detailed Algorithm description:</em></p>

<p>You can do this by keeping three variables:</p>

<ul>
<li>The number you are trying to factor (A)</li>
<li>A current divisor store (B)</li>
<li>A largest divisor store (C)</li>
</ul>

<p>Initially, let (A) be the number you are interested in - in this case, it is 600851475143. Then let (B) be 2. Have a conditional that checks if (A) is divisible by (B). If it is divisible, divide (A) by (B), reset (B) to 2, and go back to checking if (A) is divisible by (B). Else, if (A) is not divisible by (B), increment (B) by +1 and then check if (A) is divisible by (B). Run the loop until (A) is 1. The (3) you return will be the largest prime divisor of 600851475143.</p>

<p>There are numerous ways you could make this more effective - instead of incrementing to the next integer, you could increment to the next necessarily prime integer, and instead of keeping a largest divisor store, you could just return the current number when its only divisor is itself. However, the algorithm I described above will run in seconds regardless.</p>

<p>You said you don't want a straight up answer. Regardless, if you want to see one implementation of it, I've uploaded my code for this problem on Pastebin: <a href=""http://pastebin.com/hVzsPSxH"">here (C)</a> and <a href=""http://pastebin.com/M0qk0Kn8"">here (Python)</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Example: Let's find the largest prime factor of 105 using the method described above.</p>

<p>Let (A) = 105. (B) = 2 (we always start with 2), and we don't have a value for (C) yet.</p>

<p>Is (A) divisible  by (B)? No. Increment (B) by +1: (B) = 3. Is Is (A) divisible  by (B)? Yes. (105/3 = 35). The largest divisor  found so far is 3. Let (C) = 3. Update <strong>(A) = 35</strong>. Reset (B) = 2.</p>

<p>Now, is (A) divisible  by (B)? No. Increment (B) by +1: (B) = 3. Is (A) divisible  by (B)? No. Increment (B) by +1: (B) = 4. Is (A) divisible  by (B)? No. Increment (B) by +1: (B) = 5. Is (A) divisible  by (B)? Yes. (35/5 = 7). The largest divisor we found previously is stored in (C). (C) is currently 3. 5 is larger than 3, so we update (C) = 5. We update (A)=7. We reset (B)=2.</p>

<p>Then we repeat the process for (A), but we will just keep incrementing (B) until (B)=(A), because 7 is prime and has no divisors other than itself and 1. (We could already stop when (B)>((A)/2), as you cannot have integer divisors greater than half of a number - the smallest possible divisor (other than 1) of any number is 2!)</p>

<p>So at that point we return (A) = 7.</p>

<p>Try doing a few of these by hand, and you'll get the hang of the idea. Or just play with the code I've provided. Insert some print statements, see how it iterates through the numbers.</p>

<p>Maybe the 90 degree should be used to find one of the base angles and one of the vertex angles, any help is appreciated, thanks a lot, I am still learning this, any tips are very useful. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DQUf7.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>All you need to do is find one base angle, since in an isosceles triangle, both those angles are opposite equal sides, and are therefore equal.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Now that I see your image, You have enough information to find <em>everything.</em> </p>

<ul>
<li>You can use the Pythagorean Theorem to obtain the altitude (the unknown side in the middle.) </li>
<li>The vertex, B, is split into two equal angles, but you can easily find the vertex angle by first finding one of the base angles. </li>
<li>You can find the base angle B by using the fact that $$\cos B =
   \dfrac{\text{Adjacent}}{\text{Hypotenuse}}\implies B =
   \cos^{-1}\left(\dfrac{\text{Adjacent}}{\text{Hypotenuse}}\right) = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{10.9}{25.6}\right) = 64.8$$</li>

<p>Each base angle, let's call them each of measure $x$, plus the vertex angle add up to $180$.</p>

<p>So if you need to solve for the vertex angle $\theta$, we have that $\theta = 180 - 2x$.</p>

In this case, I would just specify my isomorphism (which you've basically done, by identifying the vertices A and T, B and U, and so on) and then show that two vertices are connected by an edge in the original graph if and only if they are connected in the image.

","<p>I've had to teach this to beginning algebra students (in the context of adult ed), so I thought I would put my two cents in.</p>

<p>When you square an equation the result doesn't remember what the signs of the numbers were before hand.

The extraneous solutions are  solutions of the corresponding buddy equation.</p>

<p>At this point I generally provide a specific example writing down an equation and its buddy (which has a extra negative sign) one above the other and then draw arrows going from both to the common squared equation.</p>

<p>Sometimes I either lead or wrap up the discussion by talking about different arithmetic operations they have learned and point out that if you know a number was obtained by performing addition, multiplication, division, etc. you can always tell me the original number by reversing the process but when we square a number we have no way of knowing the original sign by looking at the result. Often it is helpful to draw diagrams showing the flow of the arithmetic and make them reverse some aritmetic. </p>

<p>For instance you could say that we got 15 when we multiplied a number by 2 and added 1. Then (not emphasizing symbolic algebra but just the arithmatic) the student should be able to reverse the process by subtracting 1 (which gives 14) and dividing by 2 (which gives 7) obtaining the original number. </p>

<p>If your course is anything like mine their first instinct may be to convert the above inversion process into an equation (""rewrite the sentence as an algebraic equation and solve for the unknown""). I think it is very important to not let them do this, more likely than not they'll get caught up in trying to ""solve for x"" and probably forget why we are doing this in the first place. The point of the exercise is to teach them the ideas of invertible and non-invertible operations not to see if they can shuffle letters around on a page.</p>

<p>This should be wrapped up by giving a similar problem but now involving a non-invertible operation. For instance 25 was obtained by squaring a number what was the number. They should be able to recognize that this question is flawed because there are two numbers which square to 25.</p>

<p>This is the step I got stuck on, usually I would just divide by the parenthesis to isolate y but since y is squared, I cannot do that. Is this the right approach to finding the range of the function? If not how would I approach this problem?</p>
","<p>To find the range, we want to find all $y$ for which there exists an $x$ such that
$$ y = \frac{x+2}{x^2+5}.$$
We can solve this equation for $x$:
$$ y x^2 + 5y = x+2$$
$$ 0 = y x^2 -x + 5y-2$$
If $y \neq 0$, this is a quadratic equation in $x$, so we can solve it with the quadratic formula:
$$
x = \frac{ 1 \pm \sqrt{ 1 - 4y(5y-2)}}{2y}.$$
So, for a given $y$, $y$ is in the range if this expression yields a real number.  That is, if
$$ 1 - 4y(5y-2) = -20y^2 +8y +1 \ge 0$$
If you study this quadratic, you will find that it has roots at $y=1/2$ and $y=-1/10$, and between these roots it is positive, while outside these roots it is negative.  Hence, there exists an $x$ such that $s(x)=y$ only if 
$$
-\frac{1}{10} \le y \le \frac{1}{2}.

Thus, this is the range of $s$.</p>

<p>From this, the Pythagorean theorem says that the height $h$ (the length from the center of the bottom face) satisfies</p>

"What is the general formula for calculating dot and cross products in spherical coordinates?","44618","","<p>I was writing a C++ class for working with 3D vectors. I have written operations in the Cartesian coordinates easily, but I'm stuck and very confused at spherical coordinates. I googled my question but couldn't find a direct formula for vector product in the search results.</p>

<p>Assume that I have $ \overrightarrow{V_1} $ and $ \overrightarrow{V_2} $ vectors in shperical coordinates:</p>

<p>$ \overrightarrow{V_1} = r_1\hat{u_r} + \theta_1\hat{u_\theta} + \phi_1\hat{u_\phi} \\

  \hat{u_\theta}: \mbox{the unit vector in the direction of azimuthal angle} \\

<p>$ \theta $ and $ \phi $ angles are as represented in the image below:<br>

  \overrightarrow{V_2} = 3\hat{u_r} + \frac{\pi}{6}\hat{u_\theta} + \frac{\pi}{2}\hat{u_\phi} $</p>
","<p>Here are two ways to derive the formula for the dot product. I assume that $v_1$ and $v_2$ are vectors with spherical coordinates $(r_1, \varphi_1, \theta_1)$ and $(r_2, \varphi_2, \theta_2)$.</p>

<p><strong>First way:</strong> Let us convert these spherical coordinates to Cartesian ones. For the first point we get Cartesian coordinates $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ like this:
$$
\begin{array}{rcl}
    x_1 &amp; = &amp; r_1 \sin \varphi_1 \cos \theta_1, \\
    y_1 &amp; = &amp; r_1 \sin \varphi_1 \sin \theta_1, \\
    z_1 &amp; = &amp; r_1 \cos \varphi_1.
\end{array}
$$
Similar formulas hold for $(x_2, y_2, z_2)$. Now, the dot product is simply equal to
$$
    (v_1, v_2) = x_1 x_2 + y_1 y_2 + z_1 z_2 = \\
    = r_1 r_2 ( \sin \varphi_1 \sin \varphi_2 ( \cos \theta_1 \cos \theta_2 + \sin \theta_1 \sin \theta_2) + \cos \varphi_1 \cos \varphi_2) = \\
    = r_1 r_2 ( \sin \varphi_1 \sin \varphi_2 \cos (\theta_1 - \theta_2) + \cos \varphi_1 \cos \varphi_2)
$$</p>

<p><strong>Second way:</strong> Actually, we could have done it without coordinate conversions at all. Indeed, we know that $(v_1, v_2) = r_1 r_2 \cos \alpha$, where $\alpha$ is the angle between $v_1$ and $v_2$. But $\cos \alpha$ can be immediately found by the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_law_of_cosines"">Spherical law of cosines</a>, which yields exactly the same formula that we just proved. Basically, our first way is itself a proof for the spherical law of cosines.</p>

<p><strong>PS:</strong> I'm not saying anything about cross products, but my guess is that the correct formula will look terrible. Not only will it contain sines and cosines, it is likely that it will also contain arc functions (they will appear when we try to convert the result back to spherical coordinates). Unless those arc functions magically cancel out with all the sines and cosines. But it is highly unlikely, and I don't feel like going through the trouble of checking.</p>

<p><strong>PPS:</strong> One more thing. Cross products are not the only scary thing about spherical coordinates. If you think about it, even addition of two vectors is extremely unpleasant in spherical coordinates. Multiplication by a number is alright though, because it only changes $r$ and doesn't affect $\varphi$ and $\theta$ (at least when we multiply by a positive number).</p>

","<p>Expanding on the comment by J.M., let me quote from the (highly recommended) book by Georges Ifrah <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=FMTI7rwevZcC""><em>The Universal History of Numbers</em></a> (Wiley, 2000, pp. 21-22):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Traces of the anthropomorphic origin of counting systems can be found in many languages. In the Ali language (Central Africa), for example, ""five"" and ""ten"" are respectively <em>moro</em> and
  <em>mbouna</em>: <em>moro</em> is actually the word for ""hand"" and <em>mbouna</em> is a contraction of <em>moro</em> (""five"") and <em>bouna</em>, meaning ""two"" (thus ""ten""=""two hands"").</p>
  
  <p>It is therefore very probable that the Indo-European, Semitic and Mongolian words for the first ten numbers derive from expressions related to finger-counting. But this is an unverifiable hypothesis, since the original meanings of the names of the numbers have been lost.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ifrah then goes on to explain that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...the hand makes the two complementary aspects of integers entirely intuitive. It serves as an instrument permitting natural movement between cardinal and ordinal numbering. If you need to show that a set contains three, four, seven or ten elements, you raise or bend <em>simultaneously</em> three, four, seven or ten fingers, using your hand as cardinal mapping. If you want to count out the same things, then you bend or raise three, four, seven or ten fingers in <em>succession</em>, using the hand as an ordinal counting tool.</p>

","<p>There is something called ""canonical forms"" for a matrix; they are special forms for a matrix that can be obtained intrinsically from the matrix, and which will allow you to easily compare two matrices of the same size to see if they are similar or not. They are indeed based on eigenvalues and eigenvectors.</p>

<p>At this point, without the necessary machinery having been covered, the answer is that it is difficult to know if the two matrices are the same or not. The simplest test you can make is to see whether their <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_polynomial"">characteristic polynomials</a> are the same. This is <em>necessary</em>, but <strong>not sufficient</strong> for similarity (it is related to having the same eigenvalues).</p>

<p>Once you have learned about canonical forms, one can use either the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_canonical_form"">Jordan canonical form</a> (if the characteristic polynomial splits) or the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frobenius_normal_form"">rational canonical form</a> (if the characteristic polynomial does not split) to compare the two matrices. They will be similar if and only if their rational forms are equal (up to some easily spotted differences; exactly analogous to the fact that two diagonal matrices are the same if they have the same diagonal entries, though the entries don't have to appear in the same order in both matrices).</p>

<p>The reduced row echelon form and the reduced column echelon form will not help you, because any two invertible matrices have the same forms (the identity), but need not have the same determinant (so they will not be similar). </p>

<p>So, at then end of your proof, ask yourself: Is the ""contradiction"" just that I have deduced $\lnot P$, when the implication was $P \to Q$? Did I never use $P$ as an assumption? If both answers are ""yes"" then your proof is a proof by contraposition, and you can rephrase it in that way. </p>

<p>For example, here is a proof by ""contradiction"":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Proposition: Assume $A \subseteq B$. If $x \not \in B$ then $x \not \in A$.</p>
  
  <p>Proof. We proceed by contradiction. Assume $x \not \in B$ and $x \in A$. Then, since $A \subseteq B$, we have $x \in B$. This is a contradiction, so the proof is complete.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That proof can be directly rephrased into a proof by contrapositive:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Proposition: Assume $A \subseteq B$. If $x \not \in B$ then $x \not \in A$.</p>
  
  <p>Proof. We proceed by contraposition. Assume $x \in A$. Then, since $A \subseteq B$, we have $x \in B$. This is what we wanted to prove, so the proof is complete.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Proof by contradiction can be applied to a much broader class of statements than proof by contraposition, which only works for implications.  But there are proofs of implications by contradiction that cannot be directly rephrased into proofs by contraposition.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Proposition: If $x$ is a multiple of $6$ then $x$ is a multiple of $2$.</p>
  
  <p>Proof. We proceed by contradiction. Let $x$ be a number that is a multiple of $6$ but not a multiple of $2$. Then $x = 6y$ for some $y$. We can rewrite this equation as $1\cdot x = 2\cdot (3y)$.  Because the right hand side is a multiple of $2$, so is the left hand side. Then, because $2$ is prime, and $1\cdot x $ is a multiple of $2$, either $x$ is a multiple of $2$ or $1$ is a multiple of $2$. Since we have assumed that $x$ is not a multiple of $2$, we see that $1$ must be a multiple of $2$. But that is impossible: we know $1$ is not a multiple of $2$. So we have a contradiction: $1$ is a multiple of $2$ and $1$ is not a multiple of $2$. The proof is complete.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course that proposition can be proved directly as well: the point is just that the proof given is genuinely a proof by contradiction, rather than a proof by contraposition.  The key benefit of proof by contradiction is that you can stop when you find <em>any</em> contradiction, not only a contradiction directly involving the hypotheses.</p>

"What is the importance of the Collatz conjecture?","43560","","<p>I have been fascinated by this problem since I first heard about it in high school.  From the Wikipedia article <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_problem"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_problem</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Take any natural number $n$. If $n$ is even, divide it by $2$ to get $n / 2$, if $n$ is odd multiply it by $3$ and add $1$ to obtain $3n + 1$. Repeat the process indefinitely. The conjecture is that no matter what number you start with, you will always eventually reach $1$. [...]</p>
  
  <p>Paul Erdős said about the Collatz conjecture: ""Mathematics is not yet ready for such problems."" He offered $500 USD for its solution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My question is: how important do you consider the answer to this question, and why?</p>

<p>And would you speculate on what might have possessed Paul Erdős to make such an offer?</p>

<p>EDIT: Is there any reason to think that a proof of the Collatz Conjecture would be
complex (like FLT) rather than simple (like PRIMES is in P)?  And can this
characterization of FLT vs. PRIMES is in P be made more specific than a bit-length comparison?</p>
","<p>Most of the answers so far have been along the general lines of 'Why hard problems are important', rather than 'Why the Collatz conjecture is important'; I will try to address the latter.</p>

<p>I think the basic question being touched on is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In what ways does the prime factorization of $a$ affect the prime factorization of $a+1$?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, one can always multiply out the prime factorization, add one, and then factor again, but this throws away the information of the prime factorization of $a$.  Note that this question is also meaningful in other UFDs, like $\mathbb{C}[x]$.</p>

<p>It seems very hard to come up with answers to this question that don't fall under the heading of 'immediate', such as distinct primes in each factorization.  This seems to be in part because a small change in the prime factorization for $a$ (multiplication by a prime, say) can have a huge change in the prime factorization for $a+1$ (totally distinct prime support perhaps).  Therefore, it is tempting to regard the act of adding 1 as an essentially-random shuffling of the prime factorization.</p>

<p>The most striking thing about the Collatz conjecture is that it seems to be making a deep statement about a subtle relation between the prime factorizations of $a$ and $a+1$.  Note that the Collatz iteration consists of three steps; two of which are 'small' in terms of the prime factorization, and the other of which is adding one:</p>

<ul>
<li>multiplying by 3 has a small effect on the factorization.</li>
<li>adding 1 has a (possibly) huge effect on the factorization.</li>
<li>factoring out a power of 2 has a small effect on the factorization (in that it doesn't change the other prime powers in the factorization).</li>
</ul>

<p>So, the Collatz conjecture seems to say that there is some sort of abstract quantity like 'energy' which is cannot be arbitrarily increased by adding 1.  That is, no matter where you start, and no matter where this weird prime-shuffling action of adding 1 takes you, eventually the act of pulling out 2s takes enough energy out of the system that you reach 1.  I think it is for reasons like this that mathematicians suspect that a solution of the Collatz conjecture will open new horizons and develop new and important techniques in number theory.</p>

<p>(a) Find a vector equation of the line through these points in parametric form.</p>

<p>x=1+t</p>

<p>y=2-2t</p>

<p>z=-1+4t</p>

<p>However, I'm a little stumped on how to solve (b).</p>
","<p>You can use a formula, although I think it's not too difficult to just go through the steps.  I would draw a picture first:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YJyxF.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>You are given that $\vec{p} = (1,0,1)$ and you already found $\vec{m} = (1, -2, 4)$ and $\vec{l}_0 = (1,2,-1)$.  Now it's a matter of writing an expression for $\vec{l}(t) - \vec{p}_0$:</p>

<p>\begin{align}
\vec{l}(t) - \vec{p}_0 =&amp;\ (\ (t + 1) - 1\ ,\ (-2t + 2) - 0\ ,\ (4t - 1) - 1\ )\\
=&amp;\ (\ t\ ,\ -2t + 2\ ,\ 4t - 2\ )
\end{align}</p>

<p>Now you dot this with the original slope of the line (recall that $\vec{l}(t) - \vec{p}_0$ is the slope of the line segment connecting the point and the line).  When this dot product equals zero, you have found $t_0$ and thus $\vec{x}_0$:</p>

<p>\begin{align}
\vec{m} \circ (\vec{l}(t) - \vec{p}_0) =&amp;\ (1,-2,4)\circ(\ t\ ,\ -2t + 2\ ,\ 4t - 2\ ) \\
=&amp;\ t + 4t - 4 + 16t - 8 \\
=&amp;\ 21t - 12
\end{align}</p>

<p>Setting this to $0$ gives that $21t_0 - 12 = 0 \rightarrow t_0 = \frac{4}{7}$.  This gives the point $\vec{x}_0$ as:</p>

<p>\begin{align}
\vec{x}_0 =&amp;\ \vec{l}(t_0) =  (\ \frac{4}{7} + 1\ ,\ -\frac{8}{7} + 2\ ,\ \frac{16}{7} - 1\ ) \\
=&amp;\ \frac{1}{7}(11, 6, 9)
\end{align}</p>

<p>So finally the distance would be the distance from $\vec{p}_0$ to $\vec{x}_0$:</p>

<p>\begin{align}
d =&amp;\ \sqrt{\left(\frac{11}{7} - 1\right)^2 + \left(\frac{6}{7} - 0\right)^2 + \left(\frac{9}{7} - 1\right)^2}\\
=&amp;\ \sqrt{\left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{6}{7}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{2}{7}\right)^2} \\
=&amp;\ \frac{1}{7}\sqrt{4^2 + 6^2 + 2^2}\\
=&amp;\ \frac{1}{7}\sqrt{56} \\
=&amp;\ \frac{2}{7}\sqrt{14} 
\end{align}</p>

<p>...or perhaps $\sqrt{\frac{8}{7}}$ is more appealing.</p>

<p><strong>Extra Info</strong></p>

<p>There's no need to worry about whether or not my 2D picture is really representative--it is.  No matter how high the dimensions of the problem, the problem itself can <em>always</em> be mapped to exactly 2 dimensions unless the point is <em>on</em> the line--then it's a 1 dimensional problem--which of course we can represent in 2 dimensions just as we can represent this 2 dimensional problem in much higher ones.</p>

"Two cards are drawn without replacement from an ordinary deck of 52 cards. What is the probability that the cards are of the same suit?","43366","","<p><strong>What is the probability that the cards are of the same suit?</strong>
This specific type of question deals with the use of combinations and permutations. I know that because the cards aren't being replaced after being taken out, order does matter and therefore permutations are used. So I started off with this:</p>

<p>(13)P(2) since at first there are 13 cards of the same suit, then 12 after one of the suit is picked out and not replaced. The total came out to be 156 ways. </p>

<p>For the sample space I did (52)P(2) since at first there are 52 cards to choose from, and then there are 51 cards to choose from after the first card is picked and not replaced. The total came out to be 2652 ways. </p>

<p>So then to find the probability of the question:</p>

<p>(13)P(2)/(52)P(2)= 156/2652= 1/17</p>

<p><strong>What is the probability that the cards are both face cards?</strong></p>

<p>I started off with this:</p>

<p>There are 12 face cards in total, and because cards aren't being replaced, order does matter. So since there are 12 face cards as choices in the first try, then 11 in the second I did (12)P(2) as the numerator. The total came out to be 132.</p>

<p>For the denominator, which is the sample space, I did (52)P(2), since you are choosing 2 out of 52 cards and got 2652 ways. </p>

<p>So now I do : </p>

<p>(12)P(2)/(52)P(2)= 132/2652= 11/221</p>

<p><strong>What is the probability that the cards are a diamond and a spade?</strong></p>

<p>I was a little confused on this one, but I tried. Even though I said order matters and to use permutations, I felt like for the numerator I was supposed to combinations since choosing a diamond and spade didn't matter. Since there are 13 spades and 13 diamonds, for the numerator I did (13)C(1)*(13)C(1) which equals to 169 ways of choosing a diamond and a spade.</p>

<p>For the sample space I stayed with (52)P(2) since order still matter on this one which equals to 2652 ways.</p>

<p>So the final step is :</p>

<p>[(13)C(1)*(13)C(1)]/(52)P(2)= 169/2652= 13/204</p>

<p>I would like to know if I did these questions right, because i'm a little confused between using combinations and permutations.</p>
","<p>Almost. &nbsp; You have the probability that two cards come from a particular suit. &nbsp; You also have to consider that there are four suits from which those cards can be selected.</p>

<p>Further, we typically use combination rather than permutation for this, because order of selection in a card hand is not important. &nbsp; (Hands are ""heaps"" rather than ""lists""). &nbsp; (Though often the common factor cancels.)</p>

<p>We count ways to select a suit, and two cards from that suit.  Divide by all ways to select two cards of any suit.</p>

<p>$$\mathsf P(\text{the two cards selected are of same suit}) = \frac{{^4\mathrm C_1}{^{13}\mathrm C_2}}{{^{52}\mathrm C_2}} \times\frac{2!}{2!} = \frac{{^4\mathrm C_1}{^{13}\mathrm P_2}}{{^{52}\mathrm P_2}}  = \frac{4}{17} $$</p>

<hr>

<p>There is an alternative. &nbsp; Whatever card is drawn 'first', there are $12$ of the $51$ cards remaining that match the 'first' card's suit. $12/51=4/17$.</p>

<p>First I should find the <strong>slope</strong> of the given line and the <strong>tangent</strong> to the given curve. I'm unsure of how to proceed with this though. I know that the slope of the tangent line is equal to $\frac{dy}{dx}$ at any point on the curve.  </p>

<p>I also know that the product of the slopes of two perpendicular lines is $-1.$ I'm not sure how to apply this to the problem, and also I'm not sure about how to find $x$- and $y$-coordinates. </p>

<p>Overall I'm not sure about how to set this problem up step by step. Thank you. </p>
","<p>The slope of a line perpendicular to $y = mx + b$ is equal to $-\frac 1m$, where slope $m$ of the equation $y = 3x - 1$ is $m = 3$.</p>

$$x^2 - 6x + 9 = -3x + 12$$ $$ \iff x^2 - 3x - 3 = 0$$</p>

<p>Those solutions, (solving for $x$), will give you the $x$-coordinate of the points at which the tangent lines to the curve are perpendicular to the given line. We can simply use the quadratic equation to find the solutions, $x_1$ and $x_2$. </p>

"Multiplication in Permutation Groups Written in Cyclic Notation","43146","","<p>I didn't find any good explanation how to perform multiplication on permutation group written in cyclic notation. For example, if
$$
  a=(1\,3\,5\,2),\quad b=(2\,5\,6),\quad c=(1\,6\,3\,4),
$$ 
then why does $ab=(1\,3\,5\,6)$ and $ac=(1\,6\,5\,2)(3\,4)$?</p>
","<p>You are thinking of the permutations as functions, so when you write ""$ab$"", you mean that you perform the permutation $b$ <em>first</em>, and the permutation $a$ <em>second</em>.</p>

<p>Here's one way to do it: write the disjoint cycle expressions for both $a$ and $b$, in the given order:
$$(1,3,5,2)(2,5,6)$$
Now, moving from right to left, see what happens to each number in each cycle.</p>

<p>For instance, start with $1$, so we write $1$ down: 
$$(1,$$
The first cycle, $(2,5,6)$, does nothing to $1$, so it stays $1$. Then the next cycle, $(1,3,5,2)$, sends $1$ to $3$. So, in total, $1$ is sent to $3$. We write
$$(1,3,$$
Now consider $3$. The first cycle, $(2,5,6)$, does nothing to $3$. The second maps $3$ to $5$. So the product maps $3$ to $5$. So now we have
$$(1,3,5,$$
Now $5$. The first cycle, $(2,5,6)$, sends $5$ to $6$; the second cycle does nothing to $6$, so in total, $5$ is sent to $6$. So for the product we now have
$$(1,3,5,6,$$
Next, what happens to $6$? The first cycle sends $6$ to $2$; and then the next cycle sends $2$ to $1$. So $6$ is sent to $1$, and because we started out with $1$, this now closes the cycle we have; thus, we also close the bracket. So the product so far is
$$(1,3,5,6)$$
Now we consider the ""next"" number that hasn't been described yet, $2$. The first cycle, $(2,5,6)$, sends $2$ to $5$; then we check what the next cycle does to $5$, which is that it sends it back to $2$. So $2$ maps to $2$, and since we started out with $2$, it again closes the cycle. So now we have
$$(1,3,5,6)(2)$$
Finally we check what happens $4$, as it's the remaining number: $(2,5,6)$ fixes $4$ (it doesn't do anything to it – it remains as it is), as does $(1,3,5,2)$, so $4$ is overall fixed. So now finally we have:
$$ab = (1,3,5,2)(2,5,6)=(1,3,5,6)(2)(4) = (1,3,5,6)$$
$$\therefore (1,3,5,2)(2,5,6)=(1,3,5,6)$$</p>

<p>It's similar with $ac$. Here we have:
$$(1,3,5,2)(1,6,3,4).$$
First consider $1$: the first cycle maps it to $6$, the second cycle fixes $6$. So $1\mapsto 6$. Then $6$ is sent to $3$ by the first cycle, and $3$ to $5$ by the second cycle (reading right to left, remember), so $6\mapsto 5$. Then $5$ is fixed by the first cycle and sent to $2$ by the second cycle, so $5\mapsto 2$. Then $2$ is fixed by the first cycle and sent to $1$ by the second, which means $2\mapsto 1$, closing the cycle: we have $(1,6,5,2)$. The next number not already covered is $3$; $3$ is mapped to $4$ by the first cycle (by $b$), and $4$ is fixed by $a$, so $3\mapsto 4$. Then $4$ is sent to $1$ by the first cycle, and $1$ is sent to $3$ by the second cycle, so this closes this second cycle as $(3,4)$. Putting the two together we get
$$(1,3,5,2)(1,6,3,4) = (1,6,5,2)(3,4)$$

"Inscribing square in circle in just seven compass-and-straightedge steps","43109","","<p><strong>Problem</strong> Here is one of the challenges posed on Euclidea, a mobile app for Euclidean constructions: Given a $\circ O$ centered on point $O$ with a point $A$ on it, inscribe $\square{ABCD}$ within the circle — <em>in just seven elementary steps</em>. Euclidea hints that the first two steps use the compass, the third uses the straightedge, and the last four use the straightedge to draw the sides themselves of $\square{ABCD}$.</p>

<p><strong>Definitions</strong> The problem is not considered solved until each line containing one of the four sides of the desired square are drawn; merely finding the vertices of the square does not suffice. Naming and creating points are of course allowed and fortunately do not count toward the seven elementary steps allowed in this problem. Other than these 'zero-step' steps, Euclidea permits only two elementary steps, each costing one step:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create an infinite line connecting two points using an unmarked, one-dimensional, infinitely long straightedge. (Even merely extending a given line segment costs one step.)</li>
<li>Create a circle using a compass that collapses immediately thereafter. </li>

<li><p>As of Step 4, as observed by Jan and Tristan in the comments, $\overline{Q_1 Q_2}$ is a diameter of $\bigcirc{P_1}$, so $\angle O_1 C Q_2$ is a right angle. Therefore, $\square ABCD$ is at least a rectangle.</p></li>
<li><p>Now, define $a := |\overline{OA}|$, so that $|\overline{P_1P_2}| = a\sqrt{3}$ and $|\overline{OQ_1}| = a( 1 + \sqrt{3})$. Since $\angle AOQ_1 = 60^\circ$, if we let $R$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $Q_1$ to $\overleftrightarrow{OA}$, then $|\overline{OR}| = \frac{a}{2}( 1 + \sqrt{3})$ and 
$$|\overline{Q_1R}| = \frac{a \sqrt{3}}{2}(1+\sqrt{3}) = \frac{a}{2}(3 + \sqrt{3}) = a + |\overline{OR}| = |\overline{CR}|$$ Thus, $\angle Q_1 C R = 45^\circ$ and we may conclude that $\square ABCD$ is a square. $\square$</p></li>

<p>Prove: If a sequence converges, then every subsequence converges to the same limit.</p>

<p>Proof:</p>

<p>Let $s_{n_k}$ denote a subsequence of $s_n$. Note that $n_k \geq k$ for all $k$. This easy to prove by induction: in fact, $n_1 \geq 1$ and $n_k \geq k$ implies $n_{k+1} &gt; n_k \geq k$ and hence $n_{k+1} \geq k+1$.</p>

<p>Let $\lim s_n = s$ and let $\epsilon &gt; 0$. There exists $N$ so that $n&gt;N$ implies $|s_n - s| &lt; \epsilon$. Now $k &gt; N \implies n_k &gt; N \implies |s_{n_k} - s| &lt; \epsilon$. </p>

<p>In terms of programming, this can be achieved by using the <code>atan2</code> function, that returns an angle between two points (I believe).</p>

<p>What I want to do is find the angle between an object, and mouse click.

<p>Is there a special <code>maths formula</code> for this? Because my research on google, brings 'atan2' since I'm a programmer. Since most languages have their own maths library, it is abstraction. I want to know how the formula works, in terms of maths. </p>

<p><strong>The question is</strong>, what is the formula called for this; to find the angle between two points. So my object can rotate towards the <code>mouseX</code> and <code>mouseY</code> position</p>
","<p>The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atan2""><code>atan2</code></a> function is an extended version of the trigonometric inverse tangent function. In the figure below, $\tan{\theta}=y/x$, so $\tan^{-1}{y/x}=\theta$. The <code>atan2</code> function just calculates $\tan^{-1}{y/x}$ with <em>y</em> and <em>x</em> as separate parameters. The reason it does so is to give a more accurate answer: since the tangent function is periodic, there are multiple values of <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> that would appear to have the same angle (but do not). Also, <code>atan2</code> provides the correct values when <em>y</em>/<em>x</em> is undefined, such as at $\pi/2$.</p>

<p>Another way to find the angle you're looking for is to use vectors. Using the <em>x</em>-axis as one of the vectors and $\vec{OP}$ as another one, you could use the formula </p>

<p>$$\cos{\theta}=\frac{u\cdot v}{||u||\times||v||}$$</p>

Thank you.</p>

<p>Class boundary 60-70  70-80      80-90   90-100</p>

<p>Frequency         4        5       6          7</p>

<p>The respective frequencies are 4,5,6 and 7.</p>
","<p>The usual thing to do when finding the median of a frequency distribution is to figure out which group contains the median, and then interpolate within that group.</p>

<p>The calculation works like this: With 22 values, the median would normally be the average of the 11th and 12 values.  The first two groups contain only up to 9 data values, and adding the third gives 15 of the data values, so the median is in the third (80-90) group.</p>

<p>Now, do interpolation within the 80-90 group.  There are 6 data values in this group, and you want the one that falls 11.5 - 9 = 2.5 values in.  Take 2.5/6 = 5/12, so the interpolated median is 5/12 of the way through the 80-90 group.  Five-twelfths of the way through the 80-90 group is 5/12(10) = 4 1/6 units from the start of the 80-90 group.  Thus we need to add the starting value of 80 to 4 1/6 to obtain our interpolated median of 84 1/6.</p>

<p>As a formula, this is 
$$L_i + \frac{(n+1)/2 - CF_{i-1}}{F_i}R_i,$$
where</p>

<ul>
<li>$i$ is the group containing what would be the median,</li>
<li>$F_i$ is the number of values (frequency) in group $i$ (6 in your example),</li>
<li>$R_i$ is the range of values (upper $-$ lower) in group $i$ (10 in your example),</li>
<li>$L_i$ is the lower end of the range in group $i$ (80 in your example),</li>
<li>$CF_{i-1}$ is the total number of values (cumulative frequency) of all groups before group $i$ (9 = 4+5 in your example).</li>
</ul>

<p><HR>
<em>Alternative explanation, per request of OP</em>: </p>

<p>I think the (slightly expanded) description above essentially gives the derivation of the formula, but let me provide another way of viewing it.</p>

<p>The interpolation we're doing here is the kind that assumes that the data values in group $i$ are distributed uniformly throughout the group.  From a graphical point of view, it means that all the data points in group $i$ fall on a single line.  So doing (linear) interpolation here entails finding the equation of the line, and then plugging in the right value.  In this case, the $x$ values represent the rankings of the data points when they are placed in order, and $y$ represents the actual values of the data points.  The median has an $x$ value of $(n+1)/2$, and we want to find its corresponding $y$ value.</p>

<p>We will use the point-slope form of a line equation.  The slope is the change in $y$ divided by the change in $x$.  Over group $i$, the change in the actual data values $y$ is $R_i$, the range of group $i$.  (In the example this is 90-80 = 10.)  The change in $x$ over group $i$ is the number of data points in group $i$, which we call the frequency $F_i$ of group $i$.  (In the example this is 6.)  So the slope of our line is $R_i/F_i$.</p>

<p>For our point we assume that the last data value before group $i$ occurs at the upper endpoint of group $i-1$.  The rank of the last data value before group $i$ is the total number of data values in groups 1, 2, $\ldots, i-1$, which we call $CF_{i-1}$, the cumulative frequency of group $i-1$.  The upper endpoint of group $i-1$ is the same as the lower endpoint $L_i$ of group $i$.  So we take our point to be $(CF_{i-1}, L_i)$.  (In the example this is (4+5,80) = (9,80).)  </p>

<p>Substituting all of this into the point-slope form of a line $y = y_1 + m (x - x_1)$ we have $$y = L_i + \frac{R_i}{F_i}(x - CF_{i-1}).$$
Substituting $(n+1)/2$ in for $x$ gives the formula above.</p>

<p>The answer is 45/118, but I am unsure of how.
<strong>Update</strong>: The book may have had the question worded incorrectly, because the answer stated is incorrect.</p>

<p><strong>What i know</strong>: Each question has 3 selections, and the probability of getting one wrong is 2/3. I thought it would be as simple as the multiplicative rule, but there's more to it apparently. I think it has to do with a formula as you go along in the questions, but it states that each probability is equal, as a 1/3 chance.</p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>
","<p>If there are $n$ questions on the test, then the probability of answering <strong>exactly</strong> $k$ correctly, if answers are chosen at random, is
$$\binom{n}{k}\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^k \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{n-k}.$$</p>

<p>And it is the Muliplication Rule. To make typing simpler, I will take $k=2$, $n=5$. Write $C$ for correct, $N$ for not correct. </p>

<p>By the Multiplication Rule, the probability of $CCNNN$ (first two right, next three wrong) is $(1/3)^2(2/3)^3$. But we can also get two right, three wrong in several other ways, like $CNCNN$, $CNNCN$, and so on. Each has probability $(1/3)^2(2/3)^3$.</p>

<p>How many such strings are there? We have to <strong>choose</strong> $2$ places from the $5$ available to put a $C$ into. There are $\binom{5}{2}$ ways to do this, giving total probability $\binom{5}{2}(1/3)^2(2/3)^3$.</p>

<p>The same reasoning gives the general formula quoted above.</p>

<p><strong>Remark:</strong> If there are only $5$ questions on the test, and we want the probability of answering all $5$ correctly, the probability is $(1/3)^5$, which is nowhere near the number quoted.  </p>

<p>Because the formula for the probability has only $3$'s in the denominator, any probability we compute will have to be of shape $\frac{m}{3^e}$, where $m$ and $e$ are non-negative integers. The number $\frac{45}{118}$ is not of that shape, so cannot be the answer for the problem, or for any closely related problem. </p>

"What is the reasoning for the Discount Factor formula?","42113","","<p>I've previously come across dicount factors in my high school education but we had formula sheets so I never bothered actually learning it. In my university I have a business class in which we are now going over dicounted cash flows. Now that I'm a much more enthusiatic learner I would really like to know why the discount formula works and/or the reasoning behind it. The formula is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>Discount factor = 1 / (1 + r)^t
</code></pre>

<p>where <strong>r</strong> is the discount rate and <strong>t</strong> is the amount of years.</p>

<p>This is more business related than math related. So if your wondering why I posted this here I figured that mathmaticians would be able to better explain the reason/origins of the formula, whereas all I've gotten from asking business realted experts is pretty much 'the fomula works so it's good enough for me' sort of answers.</p>
","<p>This is annually compounded interest ($r$ is the interest rate) run backwards in time (going back $t$ years).</p>

<p>If you start with $P_0$ dollars and are using interest compounded annually, then after 1 year $P_0$ has grown to $P_1=P_0+P_0r=P_0(1+r)$ dollars [$P_0$ earns $r$ percent interest so we get $P_0r$ dollars in interest]. To see what happens after 2 years, remember that with compounded interest you must ""restart"" the computation every year. So at the end of year 2, you'll have $P_2=P_1+P_1r=P_1(1+r)=P_0(1+r)(1+r)=P_0(1+r)^2$ dollars.
Now we can see a pattern emerging and find that after $t$ years our original $P_0$ dollars has grown to $F=P_0(1+r)^t$ dollars. </p>

<p>Given a future value $F$, we can solve to find the present value $P_0$ and get $P_0=F/(1+r)^t$. Thus the discount factor appears!</p>

$$

This means in particular that whenever you right multiply it by a column vector $(x_1,x_2,x_3)$ where $x_j$ are the coordinates of a vector $x=x_1B_1+x_2B_2+x_3B_3$ with the respect to the basis $B$, you obtain the coordinates of $x$ in the canonical basis $E$.</p>

$$

That is $P^{-1}$, <strong>the inverse of the matrix above</strong>. This will transform, by right multiplication, the coordinates of a vector with respect to $E$ into its coordinates with respect to $B$. That's the change of basis matrix you need.</p>

<p>B) As explained above, you just have to <strong>right multiply</strong> the change of basis matrix $P^{-1}$ by this column vector.</p>

<p>Approach No. 1:</p>

<p>White balls on first and second draw: on the first and second draw, I can pick any of the 6 white balls on the first draw, and 5 on the second draw. After that, I have 8 balls left, of which I don't care what order they are in. This will become $6\times5\times8\times7\times6\times5\times4\times3\times2\times1=1209600$.</p>

<p>$\left(\frac{1209600}{3628800} \right)=\frac{1}{3}$</p>

<p>If we have red balls on the first and second draw, then: I can pick any of the 4 red balls on the first draw, and on the second draw any of the left over 3. This will be$4\times3\times8\times7\times6\times5\times4\times3\times2\times1=483840$.</p>

<p>$\left(\frac{483840}{3628800} \right)=\frac{2}{15}$</p>

<p>The sum of these two will be: $\frac{1}{3}+\frac{2}{15}=\frac{7}{15}$</p>

<p>Chance of a red ball on first draw: $\frac{4}{10}$. Chances of a red ball on second draw: $\frac{3}{9}.$</p>

<p>$\frac{4}{10}\times\frac{3}{9}=\frac{2}{15}$.</p>

","<p>Yes this is correct.</p>

<p>With conditional probability, you could formulate it this way:
    P(2 balls of the same color) = P(2 balls are white OR 2 balls are red)
      = P(2 balls are white) + P (2 balls are red) [since the two conditions are mutually exclusive]</p>

<p>P(2 balls are white) = P(first ball is white AND (second ball is white given first ball is white))
  = P(first ball is white) * P(second ball is white | first ball is white)

<p>Using the geometric definition of the determinant as the area spanned by the <em>columns</em> could someone give a geometric interpretation of the property? Thanks!</p>
","<p>This is more-or-less a reformulation of Matt's answer.
He relies on the existence of the SVD-decomposition, I show that $\det(A)=\det(A^T)$ can be stated in a little different way.</p>

<p>Every square matrix can be represented as the product of an orthogonal matrix (representing an isometry) and an upper triangular matrix (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_decomposition"">QR decomposition</a>)- where the determinant of an upper (or lower) triangular matrix is just the product of the elements along the diagonal (that stays in its place under transposition), so, by the Binet formula, $A=QR$ gives:
$$\det(A^T)=\det(R^T Q^T)=\det(R)\det(Q^T)=\det(R)\det(Q^{-1}),$$
$$\det(A^T)=\frac{\det{R}}{\det{Q}}=\det(Q)\det(R)=\det(QR)=\det(A),$$
where we used that the transpose of an orthogonal matrix is its inverse, and the determinant of an orthogonal matrix belongs to $\{-1,1\}$ - since an orthogonal matrix represents an isometry.</p>

<hr>

<p>You can also consider that $(*)$ the determinant of a matrix is preserved under Gauss-row-moves (replacing a row with the sum of that row with a linear combination of the others) and Gauss-column-moves, too, since the volume spanned by $(v_1,\ldots,v_n)$ is the same of the volume spanned by $(v_1+\alpha_2 v_2+\ldots,v_2,\ldots,v_n)$. By Gauss-row-moves you can put $A$ in upper triangular form $R$, then have $\det A=\prod R_{ii}.$ If you apply the same moves as column moves on $A^T$, you end with $R^T$ that is lower triangular and has the same determinant of $R$, obviously. So, in order to provide a ""really geometric"" proof that $\det(A)=\det(A^T)$, we only need to provide a ""really geometric"" interpretation of $(*)$. An intuition is that the volume of the parallelepiped originally spanned by the columns of $A$ is the same if we change, for istance, the base of our vector space by sending $(e_1,\ldots,e_n)$ into $(e_1,\ldots,e_{i-1},e_i+\alpha\, e_j,e_{i+1},\ldots,e_n)\,$ with $i\neq j$, since the geometric object is the same, and we are only changing its ""description"".</p>

"How to prove that eigenvectors from different eigenvalues are linearly independent","41753","","<p>How can I prove that if I have $n$ eigenvectors from different eigenvalues, they are all linearly independent?</p>
","<p>I'll do it with two vectors. I'll leave it to you do it in general.</p>

<p>Suppose $\mathbf{v}_1$ and $\mathbf{v}_2$ correspond to distinct eigenvalues $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$, respectively. </p>

<p>Take a linear combination that is equal to $0$, $\alpha_1\mathbf{v}_1+\alpha_2\mathbf{v}_2 = \mathbf{0}$. We need to show that $\alpha_1=\alpha_2=0$.</p>

<p>Applying $T$ to both sides, we get
$$\mathbf{0} = T(\mathbf{0}) = T(\alpha_1\mathbf{v}_1+\alpha_2\mathbf{v}_2) = \alpha_1\lambda_1\mathbf{v}_1 + \alpha_2\lambda_2\mathbf{v}_2.$$
Now, instead, multiply the original equation by $\lambda_1$:
$$\mathbf{0} = \lambda_1\alpha_1\mathbf{v}_1 + \lambda_1\alpha_2\mathbf{v}_2.$$
Now take the two equations,
$$\begin{align*}
\mathbf{0} &amp;= \alpha_1\lambda_1\mathbf{v}_1 + \alpha_2\lambda_2\mathbf{v}_2\\
\mathbf{0} &amp;= \alpha_1\lambda_1\mathbf{v}_1 + \alpha_2\lambda_1\mathbf{v}_2
\end{align*}$$
and taking the difference, we get:
$$\mathbf{0} = 0\mathbf{v}_1 + \alpha_2(\lambda_2-\lambda_1)\mathbf{v}_2 = \alpha_2(\lambda_2-\lambda_1)\mathbf{v}_2.$$</p>

<p>Since $\lambda_2-\lambda_1\neq 0$, and since $\mathbf{v}_2\neq\mathbf{0}$ (because $\mathbf{v}_2$ is an eigenvector), then $\alpha_2=0$. Using this on the original linear combination $\mathbf{0} = \alpha_1\mathbf{v}_1 + \alpha_2\mathbf{v}_2$, we conclude that $\alpha_1=0$ as well (since $\mathbf{v}_1\neq\mathbf{0}$).</p>

<p>So $\mathbf{v}_1$ and $\mathbf{v}_2$ are linearly independent.</p>

","<p><b>This is a method I found a year ago. This method takes a lot of time but it will give an accurate answer.</b><br> To calculate log(25): <br>
1) Divide 25 by the nearest power of 10. The condition must be 25 ≥ 10<sup>n</sup>.<br>
2) The value of <b>n</b> is <b>1</b> because 25 ≥ 10<sup>1</sup>. So the initial answer is <b>1.xxxxxx</b>.<br>
3) Divide 25 by 10<sup>1</sup>. The result is 2.5.<br>
4) Raise <b>2.5</b> by 10. So 2.5<sup>10</sup> ≈ 9536.7 <br><b>(Note: The number is raised to 10 because we are already looking for the digits after the decimal point.) </b><br>
5) For the next values, the same process will be used. <br>6) Divide 9536.7 by the nearest power of 10.<br>
7) 9536.7 ≥ 10<sup>3</sup> so <b>n=3</b>. The answer is now <b>1.3xxxxx</b>.<br>
8) 9536.7 / 10<sup>3</sup> = <b>9.5367</b><br>
9) Raise 9.5367 to 10. 9.5367<sup>10</sup> = <b>6222733625</b><br>
10) 6222733625 ≥ 10<sup>n</sup> so <b>n=9. </b>The answer is now <b>1.39xxxx</b>.<br>
11) Repeat the same process until you get the desired value.<br>
12) So <b>log (25) ≈ 1.39794</b>.</p>

<p>This also works on logs with bases other than 10, even with decimals. In solving log<sub>a</sub>(x), just replace 10<sup>n</sup> with a<sup>n</sup>. Also in solving for <b>n</b>, simply just divide the number by the base repeatedly until you get a <b>quotient nearest to 1</b>. The number of times you divided is <b>n</b>. (ie. 250/10= 25 <b>(1)</b>, 25/10=2.5 <b>(2)</b>, so <b>n=2</b>)<br> </p>

<p>This is a method I had formulated on my own so I'm not saying that this is 100% reliable. It would be better to check your answer with a calculator. But I've tried this many times without flaws. <b>No log tables, no need to memorize, just pure math.</b></p>

"Multiplication of a random variable with constant","41234","","<p>Suppose $X$ is a random variable which follows standard normal distribution then how is $KX$ ($K$ is constant) defined. Why does it follow a normal distribution with mean $0$ and variance $K^2$. 
Thank You.</p>
","<p>For a random variable $X$ with finite first and second moments (i.e. expectation and variance exist) it holds that $\forall c \in \mathbb{R}: E[c \cdot X ] = c \cdot E[X]$ and $ \mathrm{Var}[c\cdot X] = c^2 \cdot \mathrm{Var} [ X]$</p>

<p>However the fact that $c\cdot X$ follows the same family of distributions as does $X$ is not trivial and has to be shown seperately. (Not true e.g. for the Beta distribution, which is also in the exponential family). You can see it if you look at the characteristic function of the product $c\cdot X$: $ \exp\{i\mu c t - \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 c^2 t^2\}$ which is the characteristic function of a normal distribution wih $\mu'= \mu\cdot c$ and $\sigma' = \sigma \cdot c$.</p>

<p>So in order to calculate the Sine or the cosine or the tangent I need to know 3 sides of a right triangle. 2 for each coresponding trigonometric function. How does a calculator calculate the sine,cosine,tangent of a number (that is actually an angle ?) without knowing any sides?</p>
","<p>Calculators either use the Taylor Series for $\sin / \cos$ or the CORDIC algorithm. A lot of information is available on Taylor Series, so I'll explain CORDIC instead.</p>

<p>The input required is a number in radians $\theta$, which is between $-\pi / 2$ and $\pi / 2$ (from this, we can get all of the other angles).</p>

<p>First, we must create a table of $\arctan 2^{-k}$ for $k=0,1,2,\ldots, N-1$. This is usually precomputed using the Taylor Series and then included with the calculator. Let $t_i = \arctan 2^{-i}$.</p>

<p>Consider the point in the plane $(1, 0)$. Draw the unit circle. Now if we can somehow get the point to make an angle $\theta$ with the $x$-axis, then the $x$ coordinate is the $\cos \theta$ and the $y$-coordinate is the $\sin \theta$. </p>

<p>Now we need to somehow get the point to have angle $\theta$. Let's do that now.</p>

<p>Consider three sequences $\{ x_i, y_i, z_i \}$. $z_i$ will tell us which way to rotate the point (counter-clockwise or clockwise). $x_i$ and $y_i$ are the coordinates of the point after the $i$th rotation. </p>

<p>Let $z_0 = \theta$, $x_0 = 1/A_{40} \approx 0.607252935008881 $, $y_0 = 0$. $A_{40}$ is a constant, and we use $40$ because we have $40$ iterations, which will give us $10$ decimal digits of accuracy. This constant is also precomputed<sup>1</sup>.</p>

<p>Now let:</p>

<p>$$ z_{i+1} = z_i - d_i t_i $$
$$ x_{i+1} = x_i - y_i d_i 2^{-i} $$
$$ y_i = y_i + x_i d_i 2^{-i} $$
$$ d_i = \text{1 if } z_i \ge 0 \text{ and -1 otherwise}$$</p>

<p>From this, it can be shown that $x_N$ and $y_N$ eventually become $\cos \theta$ and $\sin \theta$, respectively.</p>

"Finding the number of Spanning Trees of a Graph $G$","41193","","<p>This is my first question on the Mathematics StackExchange site, so please do tell me if I have not adhered to any conventions in this post.</p>

<p>Ok, so if I have a graph $G$, with say $6$ vertices and $7$ Edges, how would I determine how many possible spanning tree's are there?</p>

<p>I know this is probably a very simple question, but I am very new to Graph Theory.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
","<p>One of my favorite ways of counting spanning trees is the contraction-deletion theorem. For any graph $G$, the number of spanning trees $\tau(G)$ of $G$ is equal to $\tau(G-e) + \tau(G / e)$, where $e$ is any edge of $G$, and where $G-e$ is the deletion of $e$ from $G$, and $G/e$ is the contraction of $e$ in $G$. This gives you a recursive way to compute the number of spanning trees of a graph.</p>

<p>Another rule, is that if you have a graph with a cut-vertex (a vertex which removal would separate the graph), then the number of spanning trees can be computed on each side of the cut-vertex, and then multiplied together.</p>

<p>There are some more examples of rules, for complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs and others in Section 5.2 here <a href=""http://www.student.dtu.dk/~dawi/01227/01227-GraphTheory.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.student.dtu.dk/~dawi/01227/01227-GraphTheory.pdf</a>.

","<p>Dilawar says in 2. that he knows linear dependence! So I will give a proof, similar to that of TheMachineCharmer, which uses linear independence.</p>

<p>Suppose each matrix is $n$ by $n$. We consider our matrices to all be acting on some $n$-dimensional vector space with a chosen basis (hence isomorphism between linear transformations and $n$ by $n$ matrices).</p>

<p>Then $AB$ has range equal to the full space, since $AB=I$. Thus the range of $B$ must also have dimension $n$. For if it did not, then a set of $n-1$ vectors would span the range of $B$, so the range of $AB$, which is the image under $A$ of the range of $B$, would also be spanned by a set of $n-1$ vectors, hence would have dimension less than $n$.</p>

<p>Now note that $B=BI=B(AB)=(BA)B$. By the distributive law, $(I-BA)B=0$. Thus, since $B$ has full range, the matrix $I-BA$ gives $0$ on all vectors. But this means that it must be the $0$ matrix, so $I=BA$.</p>

"Does the square or the circle have the greater perimeter? A surprisingly hard problem for high schoolers","40815","","<p>An exam for high school students had the following problem:</p>

<p>Let the point $E$ be the midpoint of the line segment $AD$ on the square $ABCD$. Then let a circle be determined by the points $E$, $B$ and $C$ as shown on the diagram. Which of the geometric figures has the greater perimeter, the square or the circle?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7FLJl.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Of course, there are some ways to solve this problem. One method is as follows: assume the side lengths of the square is $1$, put everything somewhere on a Cartesian coordinate system, find the midpoint of the circle using the coordinates of $E$, $B$ and $C$, then find the radius of the circle, and finally use the radius to calculate the circle's circumference and compare it to the perimeter of the square. </p>

<p>The problem with that method is that ostensibly this problem is supposed to be very simple; it shouldn't require the student to know the formula for the midpoint of a circle given three coordinates. Therefore the question here is: <strong>does there exist a simple way to solve the problem without knowing any complicated geometric formulas?</strong></p>

<p>For an approach less dependent on inspiration, taking the origin of the coordinate system at the center of the <em>circle</em> seems easier than placing the origin at the center of the square. Without loss of generality, assume the circle has unit radius:</p>

<p>Monty then opens $k$ doors, where $0\leq k\leq n-2$ (he has to leave your original door and at least one other door closed).</p>

<p>The probability of picking the car if you choose a different door, is the chance of not having picked the car in the first place, which is $\frac{n-1}{n}$, times the probability of picking it <em>now</em>, which is $\frac{1}{n-k-1}$. This gives us a total probability of $$ \frac{n-1}{n}\cdot \frac{1}{n-k-1} = \frac{1}{n} \cdot \frac{n-1}{n-k-1} \geq \frac{1}{n} $$</p>

<p><strong>No doors revealed</strong><br>
If Monty opens no doors, $k = 0$ and that reduces to $\frac{1}{n}$, which means your odds remain the same.</p>

<p><strong>At least one door revealed</strong><br>
For all $k &gt; 0$, $\frac{n-1}{n-k-1} &gt; 1$ and so the probabilty of picking the car on your second guess is greater than $\frac{1}{n}$.</p>

<p><strong>Maximum number of doors revealed</strong><br>
If $k$ is at its maximum value of $n-2$, the probability of picking a car after switching becomes $$\frac{1}{n}\cdot \frac{n-1}{n-(n-2)-1} = \frac{1}{n}\cdot \frac{n-1}{1} = \frac{n-1}{n}$$
For $n=3$, this is the solution to the original Monty Hall problem.</p>

"Generate all possible combinations of 3 digits without repetition","40205","","<p>It's possible to generate all possible combinations of 3 digits by counting up from 000 to 999, but this produces some combinations of digits that contain duplicates of the same digit (for example, 099). I could obtain all combinations of 3 digits without repetition by counting up from 000 to 999, and then removing all numbers with duplicate digits, but this seems inefficient. Is there a more efficient way to accomplish the same task?</p>
","<p>Yes, there does exist such a way.  First you select a digit d from {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.  Then you select a digit e from ({0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}-d).  Then you select a digit f from (({0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}-d)-e).  You <em>first</em> select 0 for d, then 1, and so on until you get to 7.  And, you always select the least digit first for e and f also, with the additional condition that d &lt; e &lt; f.  List out the first sequence, 012, 013, 014, 015, 016, 017, 018, 019.  Then list all the other numbers beneath them with the condition that for all numbers e and f, and with d held constant, the digits for e and f follow the natural number sequence <em>down</em> the column.  Partition each set of sequences by d.  The column rule only applies within each partition.  (this description might come as incomplete or could use some revision).</p>

<p>The list thus goes:</p>

<pre><code>012, 013, ...,         019

","<p>Let $f(x) = x^TAx$ and you want to evaluate $\frac{df(x)}{dx}$. This is nothing but the gradient of $f(x)$.</p>

<p>There are two ways to represent the gradient one as a row vector or as a column vector. From what you have written, your representation of the gradient is as a row vector.</p>

<p>First make sure to get the dimensions of all the vectors and matrices in place. </p>

<p>Here $x \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times 1}$, $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ and $f(x) \in \mathbb{R}$</p>

<p>Note that $x^Ta = a^Tx$ since it is a scalar and the equation above can be derived easily.</p>

<p>(Some people follow a different convention i.e. treating the derivative as a column vector instead of a row vector. Make sure to stick to your convention and you will end up with the same conclusion in the end)</p>

","<p>The amortization table you cited states that “interest is compounded semi-annually for fixed interest rates.” (Note: This fact is not derived from finance theory; this is the bank's policy.) Therefore, the effective monthly interest factor is computed as $R\equiv 1.03^{1/6}$, since $3$% is the semi-annual interest rate and there are six months in an interest period.</p>

<p>The goal is to determine the fixed amount that needs to be paid each month in order to pay off the debt in 5 years, <em>i.e.</em>, 60 months. Let $p$ denote this unknown number and $v_0$ the initial principal. The total debt by the end of the first month is: $$v_1=R v_0-p,$$ because the principal yields interest but $p$ is paid off. Similarly, $$v_2=Rv_1-p=R(Rv_0-p)-p=R^2 v_0-Rp-p.$$ By induction, it is not difficult to see that $$v_T=R^T v_0-p\sum_{t=0}^{T-1}R^t=R^T v_0-p\frac{R^T-1}{R-1}$$ after $T$ months.</p>

<p>Now, if the debt is to be paid off in $T$ months, then $v_{T}=0$, so that solving for $p$ yields:
\begin{align*}
0=R^T v_0-p\frac{R^T-1}{R-1},
\end{align*}
or, after rearrangement: $$\boxed{p=\dfrac{R^T(R-1)}{R^T-1}v_0}$$
If you plug in $T=60$, $v_0=100\mathord, 000$, and $R=1.03^{1/6}$, then you get a monthly payment of $\$1\mathord,929\mathord .86$.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is no universal agreement about whether to include zero in the set of natural numbers: some define the natural numbers to be the positive integers {1, 2, 3, ...}, while for others the term designates the non-negative integers {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}.</p>

<p>I want to find the center of mass of a semi-sphere. Could you explain me, step by step, what I have to do?</p>

<p>Many thanks</p>
","<p>We calculate the centre of mass of a half-ball of radius $1$.  Without loss of generality we may assume that the ball is made of material with density $1$.  </p>

<p>Imagine that the ball is sitting on a table, flat side down.  By symmetry the centre of mass is on the vertical line through the centre of the ball. The only question is: How far up? </p>

<p>We will calculate the <strong>moment</strong> of the ball about the plane of the table, and divide by the mass of the half-ball.  By  a standard formula, the mass of the half-ball is $\dfrac{2\pi}{3}$.</p>

<p>Imagine now that the half-ball is an industrial ham. Imagine a very thin slice of that ham, sliced <strong>parallel</strong> to the table, but left in place.  Let the slice be taken from height $z$ to height $z+dz$, where $dz$ is extremely small.  The slice is almost a cylinder of very small height $dz$. </p>

<p>We first calculate the radius $r=r(z)$ of the slice. By the Pythagorean Theorem, we have $r^2+z^2=1$, so $r=\sqrt{1-z^2}$.</p>

<p>Thus the area of the slice is $\pi r^2=\pi(1-z^2)$.  The thickness is $dz$, so the volume, and therefore the mass, of the slice is approximately $\pi (1-z^2)\,dz$.</p>

<p>The slice is at perpendicular distance $z$ from the table. So the <strong>moment</strong> of the slice about the plane of the table is approximately $\pi (1-z^2)(z)\,dz$.</p>

<p>""Add up"" (integrate) from $z=0$ and $z=1$. The full moment of the ball is
$$\int_0^1 \pi (1-z^2)(z)\,dz.$$
Calculate. We get $\dfrac{\pi}{4}$.</p>

<p>Finally, divide by the mass $\dfrac{2\pi}{3}$. We get $\dfrac{3}{8}$.</p>

<p>For a ball of radius $R$, just multiply by $R$. The centre of mass is $\dfrac{3 R}{8}$ above the centre of the half-ball.   </p>

"How do I divide a function into even and odd sections?","39295","","<p>While working on a proof showing that all functions limited to the domain of real numbers can be expressed as a sum of their odd and even components, I stumbled into a troublesome roadblock; namely, I had no clue how one divides the function into these even and odd parts.</p>

<p>Looking up a solution for the proof, I found these general formulas for the even and odd parts of a function $f(n)$:</p>

<p>$$\begin{align*}
f_e(n)&amp;\overset{\Delta}{=}\frac{f(n)+f(-n)}{2}\\
f_o(n)&amp;\overset{\Delta}{=}\frac{f(n)-f(-n)}{2}
\end{align*}$$</p>

<p>While I understand that in an even function $f(n) = f(-n)$ and that in an odd function $f(-n) = -f(n)$, I still don't get how these general formulas for the even and odd parts were obtained. Can someone guide me through the logic?</p>
","<p>Suppose you could write a function $f(x)$ as the sum of an even and an odd function; call them $E(x)$ and $O(x)$. </p>

<p>In particular, you would have
\[f(x) = E(x)+O(x)\]
and you would also have
\[f(-x) = E(-x) + O(-x) = E(x) - O(x)\]
with the latter equation because we are assuming $E$ is even and $O$ is odd, so $E(x)=E(-x)$ and $O(-x) = -O(x)$.</p>

<p>Adding both equations you get $f(x)+f(-x) = 2E(x)$. Subtracting the second equation from the first gives you $f(x)-f(-x)=2O(x)$. Now solve for $E(x)$ and $O(x)$, and you get the formulas you see in the solution. Then you check that the answer does indeed work (that is, you check that the formulas you found do give you an even and an odd function in all cases).</p>

<p>In other words: pretend you already know the answer, and try to deduce conditions that the answer must satisfy (these will be <em>necessary</em> conditions); if things go well, you'll get enough information about what they <em>must</em> be like to figure out <em>what</em> they are.</p>

"Why is negative times negative = positive?","39275","","<p>Someone recently asked me why a negative $\times$ a negative is positive, and why a negative $\times$ a positive is negative, etc.</p>

<p>Is there a better way to explain this?  Is my proof incorrect?  Also, what would be an intuitive way to explain the negation concept, if there is one?</p>
","<p>Well if I were to explain this in an intuitive way to someone (or at least try), I would like to think of an analogy with walking over the real line, by agreeing that walking left will be walking in the negative direction and walking right in the positive direction.</p>

<p>Then I will try to convey the idea that if you are multiplying to numbers (let's suppose they are integers to make things easier to picture) then a product as $2*3$ would just mean that you have to walk right (in the positive direction) a distance of $2$ (say miles for instance) three times, that is, first you walk $2$ miles, then another $2$ miles and finally another $2$ miles to the right.</p>

<p>Now you picture where you're at? Well, you're at the right of the origin so you are in the positive section. But in the same way you can play this idea with a negative times a positive.</p>

<p>With the same example in mind, what would $-2*3$ mean? First, suppose that the $-2$ just specifies that you will have to walk left a distance of $2$ miles. Then how many times you will walk that distance? Just as before $3$ times and in the end you'll be $6$ miles to the left of the origin so you'll be in the negative section.</p>

<p>Finally you'll have to try to picture what could $(-2)*(-3)$ mean. Maybe you could think of the negative sign in the second factor just making you change direction, that is, it makes you turn around and start walking the specified distance. So in this case the $-2$ tells you to walk left a distance of $2$ miles but the $-3$ tells you to fist turn around and then walk $3$ times the $2$ miles in the other direction, so you'll end up walking right and end in the point that is $6$ miles to the right of the origin, so you'll be in the positive section, and $(-2)*(-3) = 6$.</p>

<p>I don't know if this will help but it's the only way I can think of this in some intuitive sense.</p>

"Probability Of Union/Intersection Of Two Events","38937","","<p>I understand the rules for finding the probability of A or B occurring. However, the rules of finding the probability of A and B happening are a bit more elusive. In the former you add, which makes sense; in the later, you multiply, which does not make as much sense. Perhaps it has to do with the fact that both events occurring simultaneously has a lower probability. Is this one valid interpretation? I would very greatly appreciate someone being able to explain the mechanics of what is going on--that is, how can I interpret abstract math symbols in this particular case.</p>
","<p>First, you can add in the first case only if the events $A$ and $B$ are disjoint; if they can occur simultaneously, the probability of $A\text{ or }B$ is not the sum of the probabilities of $A$ and $B$. For example, suppose that you roll a fair die. Event $A$ is getting an even number, and event $B$ is getting a number that is not a perfect square. These events have probabilities $\frac12$ and $\frac23$, respectively, so the sum of their probabilities is $\frac76$, which is greater than $1$ and cannot be a probability of anything. The actual probability of $A\text{ or }B$ is the probability of getting something other than a $1$, so it’s $\frac56$.</p>

<p>The probability of getting $A\text{ and }B$ is the probability of getting $2$ or $6$, which is $\frac13$. Adding $P(A)=\frac12$ and $P(B)=\frac23$ counts this event twice, once as part of $A$ and once as part of $B$, so to get the correct value of $P(A\text{ or }B)$ you have to subtract once what was counted twice, namely, $P(A\text{ and }B)$:</p>

<p>$$P(A\text{ or }B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\text{ and }B)\;.$$</p>

<p>As for $P(A\text{ and }B)$ being $P(A)P(B)$, you’re on the right track with the idea that getting <strong>both</strong> $A$ and $B$ to occur is harder than getting either one of them to occur individually. Suppose that you perform the experiment many times; on average you expect $A$ to occur in $P(A)$ fraction of the trials, and $B$ to occur in $P(B)$ fraction of the trials. If $A$ and $B$ are independent, $B$ will occur on average in $P(B)$ fraction of the trials in which $A$ occurs, and also in $P(B)$ fraction of the trials in which $A$ does not occur. You’re interested in the former: the trials in which $A$ and $B$ both occur. Overall on average that’s $P(B)$ fraction of the $P(A)$ fraction of the trials in which $A$ occurs, or $P(A)P(B)$ fraction of all the trials. In other words, if $A$ and $B$ are independent, then $P(A\text{ and }B)=P(A)P(B)$. In the example above, $$P(A\text{ and }B)=\frac13=\frac12\cdot\frac23\;:$$ half the time on average we get an even number, and on average two-thirds of those even numbers are $2$ or $6$.</p>

","<p>You are a bit confused. The slope of the tangent is not merely
$$\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a},$$
it's the <strong>limit</strong> as $x\to a$ of that fraction. </p>

Now, unsurprisingly, the numerator and denominator both evaluate to $0$ at $x=1$. Why ""unsurprisingly""? Because this <em>always happens</em> when you try to compute the slope of the tangent. That's why we use limits. This being a rational function, you can <em>always</em> factor out $x-a$ from the numerator (in this case, $x-1$); so it was not that you ""got lucky and accidentally found"" that you could factor, with rational functions like this, a polynomial divided by a polynomial, that's what you should <em>always</em> be looking for. Indeed,
$$-(x^2-4x+3) = -(x-3)(x-1),$$
so
$$\lim_{x\to 1}\frac{f(x)-f(1)}{x-1} = \lim_{x\to 1}\frac{-(x^2-4x+3)}{x-1} = \lim_{x\to 1}\frac{-(x-1)(x-3)}{x-1} = \lim_{x\to 1}-(x-3),$$
and this limit can be evaluated simply by plugging in $x=1$.</p>

<p>Definition 2 is even easier. We want to find
$$\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h},$$
where $a=1$. Now, $f(1) = 3$, we knew that already. What is $f(1+h)$? Plug in!
$$f(1+h) = 4(1+h) - (1+h)^2 = 4+4h - (1+2h+h^2) = 4+4h-1-2h-h^2 = 3+2h-h^2.$$
So we have:
$$\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(1+h)-f(1)}{h} = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{(3+2h-h^2)-3}{h}
= \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{2h-h^2}{h}.$$
Why is this easier? Because here it should be <em>obvious</em> how to factor the numerator so you can cancel it with the $h$ in the denominator and simplify: you have $2h-h^2 = h(2-h)$. Cancel, and then do the resulting easy limit.</p>

"Determining if a sequence converges","38829","","<p>I am studying for a Calc II exam and am confused by a fairly basic step with series and sequences.  I understand the difference between the two but in all the book examples or online examples to discover if a series converges you are given a series.  </p>

<p>On my professors study guide he gives us series and sequences and asks us to figure out if they converge/diverge.</p>

<p>How do you solve such a problem for a sequence.  I will give you a problem from our study guide... This is not homework I really need this explained and want to try to figure out why for my exam.  </p>

<p>The problem:</p>

<p>Determine whether the sequence converges or diverges and if it converges determine what it converges to.</p>

<p>$a_n = \frac{5n+6}{8n+3}$</p>

<p>We have tried a couple different tests but all the info for limit/ratio test are for series.  Thanks for the help in advance</p>

<p><hr/>
<strong><em>Added</em></strong></p>

<p>So in the same light to determine if a series is convergent like</p>

<p>$\sum\limits_{x=2}^\infty \frac{2}{n^2-1}$</p>

<p>You see that it is harmonic... I think.</p>

<p>And you see that the bottom of the fraction grows to infinity you know that the series converges.  </p>

<p>Then you can look at the limit of the entire thing $\frac{2}{n^2-1}$ and see that it converges to 0.</p>

<p>Is this thought process correct?</p>
","<p>As far as your added question goes, no, I'm afraid your thought process is invalid. You are essentially using a classic misapplication of the Divergence Test.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Divergence Test.</strong> If the limit of $a_n$ as $n\to\infty$ is <strong>not</strong> equal to $0$ (either does not exist, or exists and is not equal to $0$), then the series
  $$\sum a_n$$
  diverges.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Sometimes the Divergence Test is phrased in the contrapositive:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If 
  $$\sum a_n$$
  converges, then $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}a_n = 0$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but you are still trying to use it by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirming_the_consequent"">affirming the consequent</a>, which is a logical fallacy and an invalid mathematical argument).  The Divergence Test can <em>never</em> let you conclude a series converges (look at the name: it's a dead giveaway). But that's what you are trying to do.</p>

<p>To go over the points I made in comments: whenever you have a series,
$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_n$$
you automatically get <em>two</em> sequences that are associated to the series. The sequence that you are <strong>actually</strong> interested in, <em>vis a vis</em> the series, is the <em>sequence of partial sums</em>:
$$\begin{align*}
s_1 &amp;= a_1\\
s_2 &amp;= a_1+a_2\\
s_3 &amp;= a_1+a_2+a_3\\
&amp;\vdots\\
s_n &amp;= a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n\\
&amp;\vdots
\end{align*}$$
When we ask whether a series $\sum a_n$ converges, we are <em>really</em> asking whether the sequence $\{s_n\}$ of partial sums converges. When we say that the series ""converges to $L$"", $\sum a_n = L$, we are <em>really</em> saying that the sequence $s_n$ converges to $L$. When we say the series $\sum a_n$ diverges, we are <em>really</em> saying that the sequence of partial sums $\{s_n\}$ diverges.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the sequence of partial sums is usually very hard to get a hold of. Thing about even a very simple series, like the harmonic series,
$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n} = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}+\cdots + \frac{1}{n} + \cdots$$
The sequence of partial sums is pretty complicated, in terms of trying to get a formula for the $n$th term:
$$\begin{align*}
s_1 &amp; = 1\\
s_2 &amp;= 1 + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2}\\
s_3 &amp;= 1 +  \frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3} = \frac{11}{6}\\
s_4 &amp;= 1 + \frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{4} = \frac{25}{12}\\
&amp;\vdots
\end{align*}$$</p>

<p>The consequence of this difficulty is that we usually have a very hard time telling directly whether the sequence of partial sums converges, let alone what it converges to; because it's so hard to get a hold of the series.</p>

<p>So instead we look at the <em>other</em> sequence that we get from the series (which I alluded to above): when we have the series
$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_n$$
we also get the <em>sequence of</em> <strong>terms</strong>, 
$$a_1,a_2,a_3,\ldots,a_n,\ldots$$
This is a much easier sequence to get a hold of, because we usually have it right in front of us. </p>

<p>Now, the sequence of terms is <strong>not</strong> what we are actually intereted in (we are actually interested in the sequence of partial sums), though it is of course related to the sequence of partial sums. Because the sequence of terms is so much easier to handle, though, we would like to be able to infer properties of the sequence of partial sums (in particular, whether it converges or not) from properties of the sequence of terms.</p>

<p>This is what pretty much all the tests for series that you see in Calculus II are about: they are ways in which you may be able to infer whether the sequence of partial sums converges or not, based on properties of the sequence of terms.</p>

<p>But, ultimately, we are looking in the wrong place: we are like the drunk searching for his keys under the streetlight, not because that's where the keys were lost, but because that's where there is enough light. Because we are really looking at the wrong place (and merely hoping to catch a glimpse of what we are really looking for from the corner of our eye), almost all tests are limited in some way: either you cannot always use them (e.g., the limit comparison test cannot be used if the series have positive and negative terms; the alternating series test cannot be used if the series is not alternating, etc); or they are not always conclusive (the Divergence Test can tell you a series diverges, but it can never tell you a series converges; the Ratio Test can be inconclusive; the Alternating Series Test can be inconclusive; etc). Because, ultimately, we are focusing on the wrong thing.</p>

<p>Which is what makes things so complicated and confusing for students. There is no recipe; instead, there are just a bunch of things you can try, and which may or may not work. You need to try several things, and you need to remember <em>exactly</em> what you can conclude and what you cannot from the different things you try, and <em>when</em> you can use them and when you cannot. It's a lot to keep in mind, but unfortunately it's the best we can do.</p>

<p>With practice, one comes to recognize certain series, to get more series ""under one's belt"" (so that we can do things like apply Comparison or Limit Comparison), or through experience get a feel for what kind of tests tend to work well with what kind of series (for instance, my experience tells me that trying to use the Ratio Test with the series you give in your addendum would be a waste of time, since it would come out inconclusive). But I'm afraid that comes with experience, and there is no clever mnemonic that you can memorize, or clever trick you can always use, or magic elixir you can drink, that will let you do it easily and every time (and without having to think about it too much). There just isn't any such thing, just like there isn't any such thing for finding antiderivatives.</p>

<p>For the series
$$\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^2-1},$$
what you did was apply the Divergence Test to see if the series might diverge; this is generally a good first step, because it is generally easy to do, and if the terms fail the divergence test (the terms do not go to $0$), then you are done: the series diverges. You performed the test correctly: it is indeed the case that
$$\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n^2-1} = 0$$
because the denominators grow without bound. Unfortunately, what this means is that the terms <em>pass</em> the Divergence Test, and therefore that the divergence test does <em>not</em> settle whether the series converges or diverges: the test is inconclusive.</p>

<p>Instead, you might note that this series is very close to the series $\sum\frac{1}{n^2}$; so you might want to try a comparison or limit comparison test with that series (assuming you know whether $\sum\frac{1}{n^2}$ converges or diverges).</p>

<p>Maybe it is easier to do in this order:</p>

<p>$$(x−y)\left(x^{n−1}+x^{n−2}y+\cdots+xy^{n−2}+y^{n−1}\right)=\\

<p>The second term $y\cdot x^{n-1}$ is the same as the third term $x\cdot x^{n−2}y$  except the sign, similarly the 4th and the 5th terms are canceled... So the only terms left are: $x\cdot x^{n-1}$ and $y\cdot y^{n-1}$.</p>

<p>A) Correct. Checking whether the potential subspace contains the zero vector is a great place to start on these sorts of problems. No zero vector -- not a subspace.</p>

<p>B) This is a subspace. The set of solutions of a homogeneous linear system is always a subspace (it is known as a ""null space"" or ""kernel"" of some corresponding linear transformation). In fact, if you let $M = \begin{bmatrix} 2 &amp; 9 &amp; 0 \\ 8 &amp; 0 &amp; -5 \end{bmatrix}$, then the set in B) is just $\mathrm{Null}(M)$ (the nullspace of $M$). Again, Nullspaces are always subspaces. </p>

<p>Alternatively, you could solve the corresponding system $M{\bf x}={\bf 0}$ and find that elements of that set look like ${\bf x} = \begin{bmatrix} 5/8 \\ -5/36 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}z$ for any choice of $z \in \mathbb{R}$. So this set is the span of $\begin{bmatrix} 5/8 \\ -5/36 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$ (and thus a subspace since all spans are subspaces).</p>

<p>C) Correct. You can see this is a subspace because the elements are just multiples of $(-5,3,4)$ and again spans are subspaces.</p>

<p>D) Correct. This is a subspace for the same reasons as part B) (it's the set of solutions of a homogeneous linear system).</p>

<p>E) Correct. Not a subspace. Easier counterexample: $(1,1,1)$ is in there. But $(-1)(1,1,1)=(-1,-1,-1)$ is not (so not closed under scalar multiplication).</p>

<p>My plan is to proceed to a PhD, which is actually what I would love to do and is my first option. But I wanted to have a plan B (and C, D, ...) in case things don't go as expected. So the question is: what kind of job outside academia would allow me, simultaneous, to</p>

<li>eventually allow me to keep developing my knowledge on mathematics</li>

<p>Edit: I have a minimal programming background (this basically means I learned the basics of the language C), I very much like programming (specially the logic behind it) and would definitely be interested in learning more.</p>
","<p>It seems to me that expecting to do work in pure mathematics outside of academia is perhaps,
as you put it,
<em>asking for too much</em>.
After all,
when doing pure mathematics,
one studies abstract concepts irrespective of whether or not they have any useful <em>physical</em> (or otherwise useful from a practical applications point of view) interpretations. Therefore,
if you are working for a company
(i.e., help the company gain a profit)
or a government entity
(i.e., work for <em>the people</em>),
it is to be expected that your work will be focused on applying mathematics to solve practical problems.</p>

<p>As Danny mentioned in his answer,
many domains in industry make use of notions from algebra,
logic,
as well as other fields of mathematics in that are considered pure mathematics.
However,
it must be said that this work still more closely resembles that of an engineer or of an applied mathematician than that of a pure mathematician in that,
the focus of the work is to apply algebra/logic etc. to solve applied problems
rather than to study algebra/logic for the sake of furthering our understanding of mathematics.</p>

<p>If applying pure mathematics to solve practical problems satisfies your desire to explore and use what you've learned and learn new things (which you would most certainly do a lot of even if you work as an applied mathematician),
then this is probably a good option for you.
If you work hard on you programming skills,
that together with your technical degree should make you a fairly competitive candidate.</p>

<p>As for specific examples if you're interested,
other than what Danny mentioned,
I can think of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>National intelligence agencies usually hire mathematicians to work on cryptography related problems. See the <a href=""http://www.nsa.gov/careers/opportunities_4_u/students/graduate/gmp.shtml"">NSA</a> in the US, for example.</li>

Did I get it right ?</p>

<p>If yes, then what is the point of introducing a new term ? Why not just stick with the average value of the distribution ?</p>
","<p>From my experience so far in statistics, I have more often heard ""average"" when discussing samples and in nonparametric statistics. I have first seen the definition of the expected value in a frequentist parametric statistic context, and we understood the expected value as the average of the outcomes when repeatedly repeating the procedure (the average is an unbiased estimator of the mean), which is basically the average you are discussing.</p>

<p>Hence, often, when the average is discussed, we mean the sample average (funny word play there). We compute the sample average on a given set of random variables (sample), that is a set of outcomes of a distribution. This average may yield different properties with regards to the estimation of the ""actual average"" of the underlying distribution, for instance you may consider how the mathematical definition of the sample average behaves when passing to the limit (taking the sample size to infinity), etc.; but the expected value is functionally associated to distribution with a given parameter,- a distribution that can further generate samples with different sample averages.</p>

"What does ""isomorphic"" mean in linear algebra?","38376","","<p>My professor keeps mentioning the word ""isomorphic"" in class, but has yet to define it... I've asked him and his response is that something that is isomorphic to something else means that they have the same vector structure. I'm not sure what that means, so I was hoping anyone could explain its meaning to me, using knowledge from elementary linear algebra only. He started discussing it in the current section of our textbook: General Vector Spaces.</p>

<p>I've also heard that this is an abstract algebra term, so I'm not sure if isomorphic means the same thing in both subjects, but I know absolutely no abstract algebra, so in your definition if you keep either keep abstract algebra out completely, or use very basic abstract algebra knowledge, that would be appreciated.</p>
","<p>Isomorphisms are defined in many different contexts; but, they all share a common thread.</p>

<p>Given two objects $G$ and $H$ (which are of the same type; maybe groups, or rings, or vector spaces... etc.), an <em>isomorphism</em> from $G$ to $H$ is a bijection $\phi:G\rightarrow H$ which, in some sense, <em>respects the structure</em> of the objects. In other words, they basically identify the two objects as actually being the same object, <em>after renaming of the elements</em>.</p>

<p>In the example that you mention (vector spaces), an isomorphism between $V$ and $W$ is a bijection $\phi:V\rightarrow W$ which respects scalar multiplication, in that $\phi(\alpha\vec{v})=\alpha\phi(\vec{v})$ for all $\vec{v}\in V$ and $\alpha\in K$, and also respects addition in that $\phi(\vec{v}+\vec{u})=\phi(\vec{v})+\phi(\vec{u})$ for all $\vec{v},\vec{u}\in V$. (Here, we've assumed that $V$ and $W$ are both vector spaces over the same base field $K$.)</p>

","<p>You want to prove that $\lim\limits_{x\to 1}(x+4) = 5$ using $\epsilon$-$\delta$. </p>

  <p>If $0\lt |x-1|\lt \delta$ then $|f(x)-5|\lt \epsilon$.</p>

<p>Now, we want to think a bit: how will the size of $|x-1|$ affect the size of $|f(x)-5|$? Since $f(x)=x+4$,  we  notice  that $|f(x)-5| = |(x+4)-5| = |x-1|$; that is, the size of $|f(x)-5|$ is <em>equal</em> to the size of $|x-1|$. So in order to make sure that $|f(x)-5|\lt \epsilon$, it is enough to require that $|x-1|\lt\epsilon$. </p>

<p>Thus, we can select $\delta=\epsilon$. Then $\delta\gt 0$, and if $0\lt |x-1|\lt\delta$, then it will follow that $|f(x)-5|\lt\epsilon$. </p>

How many prime numbers are there between <strong>x</strong> and <strong>y</strong> (exclusive). Is there a formula or algorithm to compute?</p>
","<p>Let $\pi(x) = \#\{p\leq x \mid p \mbox{ is prime}\}$ be the prime counting function. The Prime Number Theorem tells us that 
$$
\pi(x) \sim \frac{x}{\log x}.
$$
(That is $\lim_{x\to \infty} \frac{\pi(x)}{x/\log x}=1$.)
So, roughly speaking, around a large $x$, the probability that an integer is a prime is $1/\log x$. Thus, naively, one may expect that the number of primes in an interval $(x,y]$, for large $x$ is about $(y-x)/\log x$, and in a heuristic formula, 
$$
\pi(y)-\pi(x)\sim \frac{(y-x)}{\log x} = \frac{h}{\log x}. \qquad(*)
$$
Here $h=y-x$ is the length of the interval. This heuristic makes senses only for $h$ which is much bigger than $\log x$.  </p>

<p>From the Prime Number Theorem $(*)$ holds if $h\sim \lambda x$, where $\lambda&gt;0 $ is fixed. From Riemann Hypothesis $(*)$ holds for $h\sim x^{1/2+\epsilon}$ for any fixed $\epsilon&gt;0$. (Because the RH gives the error term in the PNT.)
There are unconditional results by Huxley and Heath-Brown showing $(*)$ for $h$ roughly being $x^{7/12}$.</p>

<p>If $h=\log x \frac{\log \log x \cdot \log\log\log\log x}{\log\log\log x}$, then $(*)$ fails for a sequence  $x_n \to \infty$.
To deal with `small' intervals Selberg worked with almost all $x$. Namely he considered $(*)$ for all $x\in \mathbb{R}_{+}\smallsetminus S$, where $|S\cap (0,x]|=o(x)$. In this sense $(*)$ holds if $h/\log^2 x\to 0$ conditionally on RH and for $h=x^{19/77+\epsilon}$ unconditionally.</p>

<p>There are also works on the case $h\sim\lambda \log x$. There the distribution of the number of primes on intervals of this size is Poission with parameter $\lambda$, conditionally on the Hardy-Littlewood prime tuple conjecture. I think this is due to Gallagher. </p>

<p>Since $x = -3$ is not in the domain, this means that the quantity of $x$ that will generate the maximum revenue is $26$.</p>

<p>To find $x$ for maximum profit, I need to first find the derivative of $P(x)$, set it equal to zero, and solve for $x$.  Thus,</p>

<p>$$P'(x) = -x^2 + 17x + 61 = 0$$</p>

<p>And here's where I run into trouble.  I'm not sure if I'm doing my math correctly or if this is just not an easy polynomial to factor.  If I can't factor the polynomial to find x, I'm not sure how to proceed.</p>

"Why do we generally round 5's up instead of down?","37876","","<p>As an example, the number 15, rounded to the nearest tens, rounds to 20. I understand it's arbitrary, as 10 and 20 are equidistant from 15, I just wonder if there's any discernible logic behind the convention of rounding up. Even something like, 'It just feels more natural', would probably satisfy me. Just had to ask :)</p>
","<p>For small numbers like $15$, it may feel closer to $20$.  We have a certain (vague) logarithmic appreciation of numbers, so $15$ feels farther from $10$ than from $20$.  As the numbers get larger, this becomes less important.  Even $25$ doesn't feel to me much closer to $30$ than $20$.  But you have to do something.  Sometimes you round to evens, which has the advantage of not accumulating errors if you add up a lot of them.</p>

"Most efficient method for converting flat rate interest to APR.","37869","","<p>A while ago, a rather sneaky car salesman tried to sell me a car financing deal, advertising an 'incredibly low' annual interest rate of 1.5%. What he later revealed that this was the 'flat rate' (meaning the interest is charged on the original balance, and doesn't decrease with the balance over time). </p>

<p>The standard for advertising interest is APR (annual percentage rate), where the interest charged decreases in proportion to the balance. Hence the sneaky!</p>

<p>I was able to calculate what the interest for the flat rate would be (merely 1.5% of the loan, fixed over the number of months), but I was unable to take that total figure of interest charged and then convert it to the appropriate APR for comparison. </p>

<p>I'm good with numbers but not a mathematician. To the best of my knowledge I would need to use some kind of trial and error of various percentages (a function that oscillates perhaps?) to find an APR which most closely matched the final interest figure. </p>

<p>What would be the most appropriate mathematical method for achieving this?</p>

<p>Please feel free to edit this question to add appropriate tags - I don't know enough terminology to appropriately tag the question. </p>
","<p>There isn't a single correct answer for your question - in fact, the method by which financial firms calculate APRs vary too. However, if you're willing to use the following definition as an estimate (and if you ignore the time value of money - that is, you value one dollar today as the same as one dollar a year later) you can use the following idea.</p>

<ul>
<li>Calculate the total amount that you will have to pay at the 1.5% interest rate. For example, for a $10,000 loan over 10 years, you will be paying a total of</li>
</ul>

<p>$$$10,000 \times (1+0.015\times10)=$11500$$</p>

<ul>
<li>Assuming equal monthly installments, calculate  your monthly installment payments.</li>
</ul>

<p>$$\frac{$11500}{120}=$95.83$$</p>

<p>Substitute that value as $c$ in the monthly mortgage payment formula. This formula calculates the monthly installments you would make on a loan where the interest charge depends on the balance. The equation can be found here, but I've typed it out for you:</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_calculator#Monthly_payment_formula"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_calculator#Monthly_payment_formula</a></p>

<p>$$c=\frac{rP}{1-(1+r)^{-N}}$$</p>

<ul>
<li>$r$ is $\frac{1}{12}$ the annual interest rate</li>
<li>$P$ is the loan principal - in this case <code>$10,000</code></li>
<li>$N$ is the number of payments to be made, in this case 120 months.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no analytic way to solve this problem.</p>

<p>However, if you are just interested in the answer, this function in EXCEL will do the trick: <code>=RATE(120, -95.83, 10000, 0)*12</code>, or more generally, <code>=RATE(N, -C, P, 0)*12</code> to give you the annual rate.</p>

<p>For this example of a 10 year loan, the APR is only 2.86% - sounds OK to me! :)</p>

"""Linearize"" an exponential-looking graph with log function","37813","","<p>This may be a beginner question, but I can't quite wrap my head around logs... I have a set of data (from an experiment) which gives me an exponential-looking graph (Fig 1). I'd like to ""linearize"" the graph, i.e. transform the data mathematically, so that the graph looks like a straight line (Fig 2).</p>

"Gamma Distribution out of sum of exponential random variables","37793","","<p>I have a sequence $T_1,T_2,\ldots$ of independent exponential random variables with paramter $\lambda$. I take the sum $S=\sum_{i=1}^n T_i$ and now I would like to calculate the probability density function.</p>

<p>Well, I know that $P(T_i&gt;t)=e^{-\lambda t}$ and therefore $f_{T_i}(t)=\lambda e^{-\lambda t}$ so I need to find $P(T_1+\cdots+T_n&gt;t)$ and take the derivative. But I cannot expand the probability term, you have any ideas?</p>
","<p>The usual way to do this is to consider the moment generating function, noting that if $S = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i$ is the sum of IID random variables $X_i$, each with MGF $M_X(t)$, then the MGF of $S$ is $M_S(t) = (M_X(t))^n$.  Applied to the exponential distribution, we can get the gamma distribution as a result.</p>

<p>If you don't go the MGF route, then you can prove it by induction, using the simple case of the sum of the sum of a gamma random variable and an exponential random variable with the same rate parameter.  Let's actually do this.  Suppose $Y \sim {\rm Gamma}(a,b)$ and $X \sim {\rm Exponential}(b)$ are independent, so that $$f_Y(y) = \frac{b^a y^{a-1} e^{-by}}{\Gamma(a)} \mathbb 1(y &gt; 0), \quad f_X(x) = be^{-bx} \mathbb 1(x &gt; 0), \quad a, b &gt; 0.$$  Then, we notice that if $a = 1$, $Y$ would also be exponential (i.e., the exponential distribution is a special case of the Gamma with $a = 1$).  Now consider $Z = X+Y$.  The PDF is $$\begin{align*} f_Z(z) &amp;= \int_{y=0}^z f_Y(y) f_X(z-y) \, dy \\ &amp;= \int_{y=0}^z \frac{b^{a+1} y^{a-1} e^{-by} e^{-b(z-y)}}{\Gamma(a)} \, dy \\ &amp;= \frac{b^{a+1} e^{-bz}}{\Gamma(a)} \int_{y=0}^z y^{a-1} \, dy \\ &amp;= \frac{b^{a+1} e^{-bz}}{\Gamma(a)} \cdot \frac{z^a}{a} = \frac{b^{a+1} z^a e^{-bz}}{\Gamma(a+1)}. \end{align*}$$  But this is just a gamma PDF with new shape parameter $a^* = a+1$.  So, it is easy to see by induction that the sum of $n$ IID exponential variables with common rate parameter $\lambda$ is gamma with shape parameter $a = n$, and rate parameter $b = \lambda$.</p>

<p>Any help in understanding the trig representations of a rotation would be extremely helpful! Thanks</p>
","<p>All of the trigonometry will be clear if you examine what happens to the points $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$ under these transformations. After they have moved, drop a perpendicular vertically and a line through the origin and consider the triangle formed. They will be (sometimes degenerate) triangles with hypotenuese 1 and then you will see why each of their legs has measure $\sin(\phi)$ or $\cos(\phi)$ etc.</p>

<p>Here's what I mean: after a $\pi/6$ rotation counterclockwise, the point $(1,0)$ has moved to $(\sqrt{3}/2,1/2)$. This point, in addition to $(0,0)$ and the point directly below it on the $x$ axis, $(\sqrt{3}/2,0$ form a right triangle with hypoteneuse $1$. Look at lengths of the short sides of the triangle. Try to do the same thing with an angle $\phi$ between 0 and $\pi/2$, and analyze what the sides of the triangle have to be in terms of $\sin(\phi)$ and $\cos(\phi)$.</p>

<p>Because a rotation in the plane is totally determined by how it moves points on the unit circle, this is all you have to understand.</p>

<p>You don't actually need a representation for <em>both</em> clockwise and counterclockwise. You can use the counterclockwise one all the time, if you agree that a clockwise rotation would be a negative counterclockwise rotation. That is, if you want to perform a clockwise rotation of $\pi/4$ radians, then you should use $\phi=-\pi/4$ in the counterclockwise rotation representation. </p>

<p>The fact that $\sin(-\phi)=-\sin(\phi)$ accounts for the change in the sign of sine between the two representations, and the fact that the $\cos(\phi)$ doesn't change is because $\cos(-\phi)=\cos(\phi)$. You may as well just pick the counterclockwise representation scheme, and perform <em>both</em> clockwise and counterclockwise rotations with it.</p>

<hr>

<p>To provide some extra evidence that it makes sense these are rotation matrices, you can check to see that the columns of these matrices always have Euclidean length 1 (easy application of the $\sin^2(x)+\cos^2(x)=1$ identity.) Moreover, they are orthogonal to each other. That means they are orthogonal matrices, and consequently represent rotations. They satisfy $UU^T=U^TU=I_2$. This demonstrates that $U^T=U^{-1}$, and now you'll notice that the transpose of the counterclockwise representation gives you the clockwise representation! Of course, rotating clockwise and rotating counterclockwise by $\phi$ radians are inverse operations.</p>

","<p>Yes, there's a more elegant way! It uses the language of <em>differential forms</em>, which has replaced the 19th-century language of gradients, divergences, and curls in modern geometry. You can appreciate the simplicity of this language even before learning how to read it:</p>

<blockquote>

  $$\begin{align*}
(\star d)(\star d)A &amp; = (\star d \star)dA \\
\operatorname{curl} \operatorname{curl} A &amp; = d^\dagger dA

  Recalling that $\Delta = d d^\dagger + d^\dagger d$, we see that
  $$\begin{align*}
\operatorname{curl} \operatorname{curl} A &amp; = -d d^\dagger A + \Delta A \\
&amp; = d(\star d \star)A + \Delta A \\

</blockquote>

<p>This is the identity you wanted to prove, where $-\Delta$ is the vector Laplacian.</p>

<hr>

<p>My favorite place to learn about differential forms is in Chapters 4 and 5 of  <em>Gauge Fields, Knots, and Gravity</em> by John Baez and Javier Muniain.</p>

<p>Here's a rough glossary that should help you move between the language of differential forms and the old language of vector calculus. I'll start by telling you the various kinds of differential forms, and the basic operations on them.</p>

<ul>
<li>In $n$-dimensional space, there are $n+1$ kinds of differential forms, from 0-forms to $n$-forms. You can think of a $k$-form as a $k$-dimensional density. A 0-form is a function, and a 1-form is a row-vector field (in coordinate-free language, a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_space"">dual-vector</a> field).</li>
<li>The <em>exterior derivative</em> is an operation $d$ that turns $k$-forms into $(k + 1)$-forms. As its name suggests, it generalizes the operation of differentiating a function.</li>
<li>The <em>Hodge star</em> is an operation $\star$ that turns $k$-forms in to $(n - k)$-forms. It comes from the dot product between column vectors. In fact, the Hodge star encodes the same geometric information as the dot product: if you know one, you can reconstruct the other.</li>
<li>The <em>codifferential</em> is an operation $d^\dagger$ that turns $k$-forms into $(k - 1)$-forms. In an odd-dimensional space, like ordinary 3-dimensional space, applying $d^\dagger$ to a $k$-form is the same as applying $(-1)^k \star d \star$. In an even-dimensional space, $d^\dagger$ always acts like $-\star d \star$.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you keep in mind that a 0-form is a function and a 1-form is a row-vector field, all the familiar operations of vector calculus can be written in terms of the ones above.</p>

<ul>
<li>The gradient of a function $f$ is the 1-form $df$.</li>
<li>The curl of a 1-form $A$ is the 1-form $\star dA$.</li>
<li>The divergence of a 1-form $A$ is the function $\star d \star A$.</li>
<li>The Laplacian of a function or 1-form $\omega$ is $-\Delta \omega$, where $\Delta = dd^\dagger + d^\dagger d$. The operator $\Delta$ is often called the <em>Laplace-Beltrami operator</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>With this glossary in hand, you should be able to follow the steps of the calculation above, which is mostly just translating back and forth between languages. The only tricky bit is getting the sign right when you rewrite $d^\dagger$ as $\pm \star d \star$: you have to figure out what kind of form $d^\dagger$ is being applied to.</p>

","<p>If we want to use a <em>convolution</em>, let $f_X$ be the full  density function of$X$, and let $f_Y$ be the full density function of $Y$. Let $Z=X+Y$. Then 
$$f_Z(z)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty f_X(x)f_Y(z-x)\,dx.$$</p>

<p>Now let us apply this general formula to our particular case. We will have $f_Z(z)=0$ for $z\lt 0$, and also for $z\ge 2$. Now we deal with the interval from $0$ to $2$. It is useful to break this down into two cases (i) $0\lt z\le 1$ and (ii) $1\lt z\lt 2$.</p>

<p><strong>(i)</strong> The product $f_X(x)f_Y(z-x)$ is $1$ in some places, and $0$ elsewhere. We want to make sure we avoid calling it $1$ when it is $0$. In order to have $f_Y(z-x)=1$, we need $z-x\ge 0$, that is, $x\le z$. So for (i), we will be integrating from $x=0$ to $x=z$. And easily
$$\int_0^z 1\,dx=z.$$
Thus $f_Z(z)=z$ for $0\lt z\le 1$.</p>

<p><strong>(ii)</strong> Suppose that $1\lt z\lt 2$. In order to have $f_Y(z-x)$ to be $1$, we need $z-x\le 1$, that is, we need $x\ge z-1$. So for (ii) we integrate from $z-1$ to $1$. And easily
$$\int_{z-1}^1 1\,dx=2-z.$$
Thus $f_Z(z)=2-z$ for $1\lt z\lt 2$. </p>

<p><strong>Another way:</strong> (Sketch) We can go after the cdf $F_Z(z)$ of $Z$, and then differentiate. So we need to find $\Pr(Z\le z)$.</p>

<p>For a few <strong>fixed</strong> $z$ values, draw the lines with equation $x+y=z$ on an x-y axis plot. Draw the square $S$ with corners $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, $(1,1)$, and $(0,1)$. </p>

<p>Then $\Pr(Z\le z)$ is the area of the part $S$ that is ""below"" the line $x+y=z$. That area can be calculated using basic geometry. For example, when z is 2, the whole square area is under the line so Pr=1. There is a switch in basic shape at $z=1$. </p>

<p>A sort of real world example for this, if it helps, is of a car.  The car starts at p=0, with a rolling start (in either direction).  At the finish line (ending position) is a brick wall.  The car must stop with the front bumper touching the brick wall.  It must accelerate at a for as long as possible, then decelerate at d, ending at that brick wall, with v=0.</p>

<p>(I'm writing an Arduino library for controlling servos, with speed limits, acceleration and deceleration.  I need to know whether the max velocity it can reach given the acceleration and deceleration will ever exceed the max velocity the library user specifies, so I can calculate whether there needs to be any time spent ""coasting"" between acceleration and deceleration.)</p>
","<p>We assume the object starts at time $t=0$ at position $x=0$ and ends at position $\ell$. It accelerates constantly with acceleration $a$ and then suddenly at time $t=t_1$ it decelerates constantly with deceleration $d$ (positive) until stopping at the point $\ell$. Let us call $t_2$ the deceleration time. </p>

<p>Then $v_\max=v_0+at_1$. To find $t_1$, note that $$v_0+at_1-dt_2=0;$$ this is the condition that the speed at $x=\ell$ is zero. And the distance has to be $\ell$, so 
$$
v_0t_1+\frac12at_1^2+(v_0t_2+at_1t_2-\frac12dt_2^2)=\ell.
$$
The term between brackets comes from the fact that the speed during the deceleration process is $v_\max-dt$, so the distance covered during the deceleration process is $v_\max t_2-\frac12dt_2^2$.</p>

<p>From the first equation, we get $t_2=(v_0+at_1)/d$. Plugging this into the second equation and solving, 
$$
t_1=-\frac{v_0}a+\frac1a\sqrt{\frac{d v_0^2+2a\ell d}{a+d}}.
$$
So
$$
v_\max=v_0+at_1=\sqrt{\frac{d v_0^2+2a\ell d}{a+d}}.

  <p>...except in the case where standard deviation of the basic set is unknown...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am not really sure what it means, could you please help me. For what types of data can't we define the standard deviation?</p>
","<p>What they are talking about is the value of the standard deviation.  When the value is assumed to be known you can divide the sample mean by it and if the samples have a normal distribution the sample mean minus the population mean divided by the ""known"" standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size n has a standard normal distribution (a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1).  This fact is then used to construct confidence intervals for the population mean based on teh standard normal distribution.</p>

<p>However in most prectical situations the value of the standard deviation is unknown and we use a sample estimate to scale since we can't use a known value.  Under the same assumptions about the sample distribution the sample mean- the population mean divided by its estimated standard error has a t distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom. So when the population variance is unknown the t distribution is used to construct confidence intervals for the population mean.  The standard error of the mean is the sample standard deviation divided by the square root of n.  </p>

<p>I hope this makes it clear.  Statistics text categorize the estimate of the mean into two case (1) standard deviation known where the standard normal is used and the case where the standard deviation is unknown and the t distribution is used.</p>

"On average, how many times must I roll a dice until I get a $6$?","37264","","<p>On average, how many times must I roll a dice until I get a $6$?</p>

<p>I got this question from a book called Fifty Challenging Problems in Probability. </p>

<p>The answer is $6$, and I understand the solution the book has given me. However, I want to know why the following logic does not work: The chance that we do not get a $6$ is $5/6$. In order to find the number of dice rolls needed, I want the probability of there being a $6$ in $n$ rolls being $1/2$ in order to find the average. So I solve the equation $(5/6)^n=1/2$, which gives me $n=3.8$-ish. That number makes sense to me intuitively, where the number $6$ does not make sense intuitively. I feel like on average, I would need to roll about $3$-$4$ times to get a $6$. Sometimes, I will have to roll less than $3$-$4$ times, and sometimes I will have to roll more than $3$-$4$ times.</p>

<p>Please note that I am not asking how to solve this question, but what is wrong with my logic above.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
","<p>You can calculate the average this way also.</p>

<p>The probability of rolling your first $6$ on the $n$-th roll is $$\left[1-\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^n\right]-\left[1-\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{n-1}\right]=\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{n-1}-\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{n}$$</p>

<p>So the weighted average on the number of rolls would be 
$$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(n\left[\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{n-1}-\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{n}\right]\right)=6$$</p>

<p>Again, as noted already, the difference between mean and median comes in to play.  The distribution has a long tail way out right pulling the mean to $6$.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iItFE.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>For those asking about this graph, it is the expression above, without the Summation.  It is not cumulative.  (The cumulative graph would level off at $y=6$).  This graph is just $y=x\left[\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{x-1}-(\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{x}\right]$</p>

<p>It's not a great graph, honestly, as it is kind of abstract in what it represents.  But let's take $x=4$ as an example.  There is about a $0.0965$ chance of getting the first roll of a $6$ on the $4$th roll.  And since we're after a weighted average, that is multiplied by $4$ to get the value at $x=4$.  It doesn't mean much except to illustrate why the mean number of throws to get the first $6$ is higher than around $3$ or $4.$</p>

<p>You can imagine an experiment with $100$ trials.  About $17$ times it will only take $1$ throw($17$ throws).  About $14$ times it will take $2$ throws ($28$ throws).  About $11$ times it will take $3$ throws($33$ throws).  About $9$ times it will take $4$ throws($36$ throws) etc.  Then you would add up ALL of those throws and divide by $100$ and get $\approx 6.$</p>

","<p>The below is too long for a comment so I'm including it here even though I'm not sure it ""answers"" the question.</p>

<p>If you think about $(1+x)^{-n}$ as living in the ring of formal power series $\mathbb{Z}[[x]]$, then you can show that $$(1+x)^{-n} = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (-1)^k \binom{n+k-1}{k} x^k$$ and the identity $\binom{-n}{k} = (-1)^k \binom{n+k-1}{k}$ seems very natural.  Here's how...</p>

<p>First expand $(1+x)^{-n} = \bigg(\frac{1}{1-(-x)}\bigg)^n =  (1 - x + x^2 - x^3 + \dots)^n$.  Now, the coefficient on $x^k$ in that product is simply the number of ways to write $k$ as a sum of $n$ nonnegative numbers.  That set of sums is in bijection to the set of diagrams with $k$ stars with $n-1$ bars among them. (For example, suppose $k=9$ and $n=4$.  Then, <code>**|*|***|***</code> corresponds to the sum $9=2+1+3+3$; <code>****||***|**</code>corresponds to the sum $9 = 4+0+3+2$; <code>****|***||**</code> corresponds to $9=4+3+0+2$; etc.) In each of these stars-and-bars diagrams we have $n+k-1$ objects, and we choose which ones are the $k$ stars in $\binom{n+k-1}{k}$ many ways.  The $(-1)^k$ term comes from the alternating signs, and that proves the sum.</p>

How do I find the slope of the line joining $p_1$ and $p_2$? 
After getting the slope (which I assume will be an integer) how do I get the coordinates of any other arbitrary point on this line?</p>

","<p>In two dimensions, we often write a line in the form 
$$y = mx + b.$$</p>

<p>However, there are other equivalent forms.  Given a point $(x_0, y_0)$ on a line and the slope of the line, we can also write 
$$y - y_0 = m(x - x_0).$$</p>

<p>A disadvantage of this formula is that it cannot express lines where $x$ is constant, for example, the line $x=3$ (this problem arises because we have defined $y$ as a function of $x$).  To remedy this problem, we might instead write the line in parametric form:
$$\left\{\begin{array}{}y = y_0 + m_yt\\
x = x_0 + m_xt\end{array}\right.$$</p>

<p>We can make this formula slightly more compact by using <a href=""http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcII/VectorsIntro.aspx"">vector</a> notation:</p>

<p>$$\langle x,y\rangle = \langle x_0, y_0\rangle + t\langle m_x, m_y\rangle.$$</p>

<p>In this form, we call the vector $\langle m_x, m_y\rangle$ the direction vector.  It turns out that the direction vector is a useful analog of slope in higher dimensions: in two dimensions, the ratio between the change in $x$ and $y$ is $\Delta x:\Delta y = m_x : m_y$, and this is true even if $\Delta x = 0, \Delta y \not= 0$.</p>

<p>In three dimensions, we have</p>

<p>$$\langle x,y,z\rangle = \langle x_0, y_0, z_0\rangle +t\langle m_x, m_y, m_z\rangle.$$</p>

<p>For your particular example, we can pick $\langle x_0, y_0, z_0\rangle = \langle 5,5,5\rangle$, $\langle m_x, m_y, m_z\rangle = \langle 1,2,3\rangle - \langle5,5,5\rangle= \langle-4,-3,-2\rangle$, so the line can be expressed as</p>

<p>$$\langle x,y,z\rangle = \langle 5,5,5\rangle +t\langle -4,-3,-2\rangle,$$</p>

<p>and the line has the direction vector $\langle -4, -3, -2 \rangle$.  Observe that by varying the value of $t$, we can get other points on the line: $t=0$ corresponds to $p_1$, $t=1$ corresponds to $p_2$, and other $t$ values will correspond to other points.  </p>

&amp;e^x \cdot \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{e^h-1}{h}
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>Where can I go from here? Because, the $\lim$ portion reduces to indeterminate when $0$ is subbed into $h$. </p>
","<p>Sometimes one <em>defines</em> $e$ as the (unique) number for which $$\tag 1 \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{e^h-1}{h}=1$$</p>

<p>In fact, there are two possible directions. </p>

<p>$(i)$ Start with the logarithm. You'll find out it is continuous monotone increasing on $\Bbb R_{&gt;0}$, and it's range is $\Bbb R$. It follows $\log x=1$ for some $x$. We define this (unique) $x$ to be $e$. Some elementary properties will pop up, and one will be $$\tag 2 \lim\limits_{x\to 0}\frac{\log(1+x)}{x}=1$$</p>

<p>Upon defining $\exp x$ as the inverse of the logarithm, and after some rules, we will get to defining exponentiation of $a&gt;0\in \Bbb R$ as $$a^x:=\exp(x\log a)$$</p>

<p>In said case, $e^x=\exp(x)$, as we expected. $(1)$ will then be an immediate consequence of $(2)$.</p>

<p>$(ii)$ We might define $$e=\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac 1 {k!}$$ (or the equivalent Bernoulli limit). Then, we may define $$\exp x=\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{x^k}{k!}$$ Note $$\tag 3 \exp 1=e$$</p>

<p>We define the $\log$ as the inverse of the exponential function. We may derive certain properties of $\exp x$. The most important ones would be $$\exp(x+y)=\exp x\exp y$$ $$\exp'=\exp$$ $$\exp 0 =1$$</p>

<p>In particular, we have that $\log e=1$ by. We might then define general exponentiation yet again by $$a^x:=\exp(x\log a)$$</p>

<p>Note then that again $e^x=\exp x$. We can prove $(1)$ easily recurring to the series expansion we used.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>ADD</strong> As for the definition of the logarithm, there are a few ones. One is $$\log x=\int_1^x \frac{dt}{t}$$</p>

<p>Having defined exponentiation of real numbers using rationals by $$a^x=\sup\{a^r:r\in\Bbb Q\wedge r&lt;x\}$$</p>

<p>we might also define $$\log x=\lim_{k\to 0}\frac{x^k-1}{k}$$</p>

<p>In any case, you should be able to prove that </p>

<p>$$\tag 1 \log xy = \log x +\log y $$
$$\tag 2 \log x^a = a\log x  $$
$$\tag 3 1-\dfrac 1 x\leq\log x \leq x-1 $$
$$\tag 4\lim\limits_{x\to 0}\dfrac{\log(1+x)}{x}=1 $$
$$\tag 5\dfrac{d}{dx}\log x = \dfrac 1 x$$</p>

<p>What you want is a direct consequence of either $(4)$ or $(5)$, or of the first sentence in my post.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>ADD</strong> We can prove that for $x \geq 0$ $$\lim\left(1+\frac xn\right)^n=\exp x$$ from definition $(ii)$. </p>

<p>First, note that $${n\choose k}\frac 1{n^k}=\frac{1}{{k!}}\frac{{n\left( {n - 1} \right) \cdots \left( {n - k + 1} \right)}}{{{n^k}}} = \frac{1}{{k!}}\left( {1 - \frac{1}{n}} \right)\left( {1 - \frac{2}{n}} \right) \cdots \left( {1 - \frac{{k - 1}}{n}} \right)$$</p>

<p>Since all the factors to the rightmost are $\leq 1$, we can claim $${n\choose k}\frac{1}{{{n^k}}} \leqslant \frac{1}{{k!}}$$</p>

<p>It follows that $${\left( {1 + \frac{x}{n}} \right)^n}=\sum\limits_{k = 0}^n {{n\choose k}\frac{{{x^k}}}{{{n^k}}}}  \leqslant \sum\limits_{k = 0}^n {\frac{{{x^k}}}{{k!}}} $$</p>

<p>It follows that <strong>if</strong> the limit on the left exists, $$\lim {\left( {1 + \frac{x}{n}} \right)^n} \leqslant \lim \sum\limits_{k = 0}^n {\frac{{{x^k}}}{{k!}}}  = \exp x$$</p>

<p>Note that the sums in $$\sum\limits_{k = 0}^n {{n\choose k}\frac{{{x^k}}}{{{n^k}}}} $$</p>

<p>are always increasing, which means that for $m\leq  n$</p>

<p>$$\sum\limits_{k = 0}^m {{n\choose k}\frac{{{x^k}}}{{{n^k}}}}\leq  \sum\limits_{k = 0}^n {{n\choose k}\frac{{{x^k}}}{{{n^k}}}}$$</p>

<p>By letting $n\to\infty$, since $m$ is fixed on the left side, and $$\mathop {\lim }\limits_{n \to \infty } \frac{1}{{k!}}\left( {1 - \frac{1}{n}} \right)\left( {1 - \frac{2}{n}} \right) \cdots \left( {1 - \frac{{k - 1}}{n}} \right) = \frac{1}{{k!}}$$</p>

<p>we see that <strong>if</strong> the limit exists, then for each $m$, we have $$\sum\limits_{k = 0}^m {\frac{{{x^k}}}{{k!}}}  \leqslant \lim {\left( {1 + \frac{x}{n}} \right)^n}$$</p>

<p>But then, taking $m\to\infty$ $$\exp x = \mathop {\lim }\limits_{m \to \infty } \sum\limits_{k = 0}^m {\frac{{{x^k}}}{{k!}}}  \leqslant \lim {\left( {1 + \frac{x}{n}} \right)^n}$$</p>

<p>It follows that <strong>if</strong> the limit exists $$\eqalign{
  &amp; \exp x \leqslant \lim_{n\to\infty} {\left( {1 + \frac{x}{n}} \right)^n}  \cr 
  &amp; \exp x \geqslant \lim_{n\to\infty} {\left( {1 + \frac{x}{n}} \right)^n} \cr}$$ which means $$\exp x = \lim_{n\to\infty} {\left( {1 + \frac{x}{n}} \right)^n}$$ Can you show the limit exists?</p>

<p>The case $x&lt;0$ follows now from $$\displaylines{
  {\left( {1 - \frac{x}{n}} \right)^{ - n}} = {\left( {\frac{n}{{n - x}}} \right)^n} \cr 
   = {\left( {\frac{{n - x + x}}{{n - x}}} \right)^n} \cr 
   = {\left( {1 + \frac{x}{{n - x}}} \right)^n} \cr} $$</p>

<p>using the squeeze theorem with $\lfloor n-x\rfloor$, $\lceil n-x\rceil$, and the fact $x\to x^{-1}$ is continuous. We care only for terms $n&gt;\lfloor x\rfloor$ to make the above meaningful.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong> If you're acquainted with $\limsup$ and $\liminf$; the above can be put differently as $$\eqalign{
  &amp; \exp x \leqslant \lim \inf {\left( {1 + \frac{x}{n}} \right)^n}  \cr 
  &amp; \exp x \geqslant \lim \sup {\left( {1 + \frac{x}{n}} \right)^n} \cr} $$ which means $$\lim \inf {\left( {1 + \frac{x}{n}} \right)^n} = \lim \sup {\left( {1 + \frac{x}{n}} \right)^n}$$ and proves the limit exists and is equal to $\exp x$.</p>

"Distance/Similarity between two matrices","36943","","<p>I'm in the process of writing an application which identifies the closest matrix from a set of square matrices $M$ to a given square matrix $A$. The closest can be defined as the most similar.</p>

<p>I think finding the distance between two given matrices is a fair approach since the smallest Euclidean distance is used to identify the closeness of vectors. </p>

<p>I found that the distance between two matrices ($A,B$) could be calculated using the <a href=""http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FrobeniusNorm.html"">Frobenius distance</a> $F$:</p>

<p>$$F_{A,B} = \sqrt{trace((A-B)*(A-B)')} $$</p>

<p>where $B'$ represents the conjugate transpose of B.</p>

<p>I have the following points I need to clarify</p>

<ul>
<li>Is the distance between matrices a fair measure of similarity?</li>
<li>If distance is used, is Frobenius distance a fair measure for this problem? any other suggestions?</li>
</ul>
","<p>Some suggestions. Too long for a comment:</p>

<p>As I said, there are many ways to measure the ""distance"" between two matrices. If the matrices are $\mathbf{A} = (a_{ij})$ and $\mathbf{B} = (b_{ij})$, then some examples are:
$$
d_1(\mathbf{A}, \mathbf{B}) = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n |a_{ij} - b_{ij}|
$$
$$
d_2(\mathbf{A}, \mathbf{B}) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n (a_{ij} - b_{ij})^2}
$$
$$
d_\infty(\mathbf{A}, \mathbf{B}) = \max_{1 \le i \le n}\max_{1 \le j \le n} |a_{ij} - b_{ij}|
$$
$$
d_m(\mathbf{A}, \mathbf{B}) = \max\{ \|(\mathbf{A} - \mathbf{B})\mathbf{x}\| : \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n, \|\mathbf{x}\| = 1 \}
$$
I'm sure there are many others. If you look up ""matrix norms"", you'll find lots of material. And if $\|\;\|$ is any matrix norm, then $\| \mathbf{A} - \mathbf{B}\|$ gives you a measure of the ""distance"" between two matrices $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$.</p>

<p>Or, you could simply count the number of positions where $|a_{ij} - b_{ij}|$ is larger than some threshold number. This doesn't have all the nice properties of a distance derived from a norm, but it still might be suitable for your needs.</p>

<p>These distance measures all have somewhat different properties. For example, the third one shown above will tell you that two matrices are far apart even if all their entries are the same except for a large difference in one position.</p>

","<p>Yes, you are correct; the two integrals are the same since |x| = x on the interval from 1 to 4. If you ever need to take the integral of some strange function, it's worth remembering that integrating something is simply finding the limit of the sum of increasingly thinner rectangles approximating the area under the function.

<p>Find an equation of the sphere that passes through the origin and whose center is (5, 10, -9).</p>

<p><strong><em>_</em>__</strong> = 0 
Note that you must put everything on the left hand side of the equation and that we desire the coefficients of the quadratic terms to be 1.</p>

<p>Similarly, how would one approach this:</p>

<p>Find an equation of the largest sphere with center (2, 10 , 4) that is contained completely in the first octant.</p>

<p>= 0 
Note that you must move everything to the left hand side of the equation that we desire the coefficients of the quadratic terms to be 1.</p>
","<p>Let $r$ be the radius of the sphere. Then the equation of the sphere with center $(5,10,-9)$ is $$ (x-5)^{2} + (y-10)^{2} + (z+9)^{2} =r^{2}$$</p>

<p>Now since your sphere passes through the origin$=(0,0,0)$, therefore you get $r^{2}=5^{2}+10^{2}+9^{2}=25+100+81=206$. Therefore the equation of the sphere is: $$(x-5)^{2}+(y-10)^{2}+(z-9)^{2}=206$$</p>

<p>For the next one:</p>

<p>If the sphere is in the 1st octant, the largest possible sphere must be tangent to either the $xy, xz$, $yz$ planes. That is, the radius of the sphere must be such that the surface of the sphere just touches one of the planes.</p>

","<p>Since the nullity of $T$ is $n-k$, that means that the geometric multiplicity of $\lambda=0$ as an eigenvalue of $T$ is $n-k$; hence, the algebraic multiplicity must be at least $n-k$, which means that the characteristic polynomial of $T$ is of the form $x^{N}g(x)$, where $N$ is the algebraic multiplicity of $0$, hence $N\geq n-k$ (so $n-N\leq k$), and $\deg(g) =n-N$. Thus, $g$ has at most $n-N$ distinct roots, none of which are equal to $0$, and that means that the characteristic polynomial of $T$ has exactly:

","<p>You should know that any complex number can be represented as a point in the Cartesian ($x$-$y$) plane. That is to say that a complex number $z=a+b\text i$ is associated with some point (say $A$) having co-ordinates $(a,b)$ in the Cartesian plane.
You might have heard this as the <strong>Argand Diagram</strong>.<br><br> Let $\tan \theta$ be the <em>direction ratio</em> of the vector $\vec{OA}$ (Assume the line joining the <em>origin</em>, $O$ and point $A$ to be a vector)<br></p>

<p>However, we can't go about claiming $\theta$ to be $\operatorname {Arg}(z)$ just yet. There is a small detail that we need to keep in mind (Thank you to a user for pointing that out!). We need to watch out for the quadrant on which our complex number lies and work accordingly. <br>
<strong>Example</strong> Say there are 2 complex numbers $z=a+b\text i$ and $w=-a-b\text i$. Then, $$\operatorname{Arg}(w)=\arctan\Big( \frac {-b}{-a} \Big )= \arctan\Big( \frac {b}{a} \Big )= \operatorname{Arg}(z)$$
which is just preposterous. It suggests that $w$, which lies on the third quadrant on the Argand Diagram,  has the same argument as a complex number ($z$) which in the first quadrant. To correct this issue, we'll have to put forth some simple conditions. As we just saw, one of them could go something like: $\text{ if } a,b&lt;0 \text{ then } \operatorname{Arg}(z)=\theta -\pi$<br></p>

<p>Here is a list of conditions for computing the <em>Argument</em> (This has already been mentioned in one of the answers above and I am just re-posting it here). Once you get a intuitive feel for this, it should come to you naturally.<br>
$\varphi = \arg(z) =
\begin{cases}
\theta &amp; \mbox{if } x &gt; 0 \\
\theta + \pi &amp; \mbox{if } x &lt; 0  \mbox{ and } y \ge 0\\
\theta - \pi &amp; \mbox{if } x &lt; 0 \mbox{ and } y &lt; 0\\

<strong>Alternatively</strong>, you can use the fact that $|z| \sin \theta= b$ (or, $|z| \cos \theta= a$) and then solve for $\theta$.

<p>Is this correct?</p>

<p>Let me expand the question as I wasn't clear earlier: If A is in the top 20th percentile, are B and C in the top 40th percentile or top 60th percentile?</p>
","<p>You've got them backwards. The 20th percentile would be the level below which only 20% of the observations fall. Since 80% of the scores fall below A's score (four out of 5), then A is in the 80th percentile. Since 20% of the scores fall below D's score, then D is in the 20th percentile, not the 80th. See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia's page</a> on percentiles (it's rather rough, but the lead will do it). </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> You edited the question, so here goes the answer to that: 
It seems that you are not really asking about <em>percentiles</em>, but about <strong>percents</strong>. They are not the same thing. A is in the top 20 percent, but not ""the top 20 percentile"". By <em>definition</em>, <strong>percentile</strong> refers to how many quantities are <em>below</em>. It makes no sense to talk about ""top 20 percentile"".  Your intended question is about percents, not 'percentiles'.</p>

<p>To answer that: You have 5 people; A is the top, B and C are tied in second, D is in fourth, and E in fifth. A is certainly in the top 20% of the group, E in the bottom 20%; D and E are in the bottom 40%. A, B, and C are in the top 60% (not the top 40%); B, C, D, and E are in the bottom 80%. But you are using ""percentile"" wrong. If X is in the 40th percentile, then that means that 40% of the scores are below him; that would mean he is at the bottom of the top 60%. A is in the 80 percentile, B and C are in the 40th percentile, D is in the 20th percentile. </p>

"How do I find the derivative of this equation using the fundamental theorem of calculus?","36192","","<p>Can someone explain how to find the derivative using the fundamental theorem of calculus on the following equation?</p>

","<p>Here is one way to think about it. What is your usual approach to calculating a definite integral, like
$$\int_2^x t^2\sin(t)\,dt?$$</p>

<p>Ordinarily, you go through the following steps:</p>

<p>$1$. Find an antiderivative $F(t)$ of $f(t)$, where $f(t)=t^2\sin(t)$. That is, find a function $F(t)$ such that $F'(t)=f(t)=t^2\sin(t)$.</p>

<p>$2$. Then $\int_2^x t^2\sin(t)\,dt=F(x)-F(2)$ (you ""plug in"").</p>

<p>We are asked for the derivative of $\int_2^x t^2\sin(t)\,dt$ with respect to $x$. Since the integral is $F(x)-F(2)$, you need to differentiate $F(x)-F(2)$. The answer is $F'(x)$. But $F'(x)=f(x)=x^2\sin(x)$, and we are finished.</p>

<p>Note that we did not need to <em>find</em> an explicit formula for $F(t)$. That would be a waste of time, we would be integrating $f(t)$ to find $F(x)-F(2)$, only to turn around and <em>differentiate</em> it!</p>

<p>With a little work (integration by parts), we could in fact find an explicit antiderivative $F(t)$ of $t^2\sin(t)$. But look at the problem of finding the derivative with respect to $x$ of $\int_1^x \sin(t^2)\,dt$. You will not be able to find a ""nice"" function whose derivative is $\sin(t^2)$. (Neither will I.) But using the same reasoning as above, we can see that the derivative of $\int_1^x\sin(t^2)\,dt$ with respect to $x$ is $\sin(x^2)$.</p>

<p>Here is a fancier example. Find the derivative with respect to $x$ of $\int_1^{x^2}e^{-t^3}\,dt$. Imagine that we were able to find an explicit antiderivative $F(t)$ of $f(t)=e^{-t^3}$. Then our integral would be $F(x^2)-F(1)$. The derivative of this with respect to $x$ is $(2x)F'(x^2)$ (remember the Chain Rule). But $F'(t)=f(t)=e^{-t^3}$, and therefore our derivative is $(2x)e^{-x^6}$.  Note that at no time did we actually find an explicit antiderivative of $e^{-t^3}$.</p>

"Pointwise vs. Uniform Convergence","36149","","<p>This is a pretty basic question. I just don't understand the definition of uniform convergence.</p>

<p>Here are my given definitions for pointwise and uniform convergence:</p>

<p>Pointwise convergence: Let $X$ be a set, and let $F$ be the real or complex numbers. Consider a sequence of functions $f_n$ where $f_n:X\to F$ is a bounded function for each $n\in \mathbb N$. $f:X\to F$ is the pointwise limit of $f_n$ if for every $x \in X$, $$\lim_{n\to \infty}f_n(x)=f(x).$$</p>

<p>Uniform convergence: Let $f_n$ be a sequence of functions in the set of all bounded functions from $X$ to $F$ where $F$ is the real or complex numbers. The sequence is said to converge uniformly to a bounded function $f:X \to F$ if, given $\epsilon&gt;0$, there exists an $N\in \mathbb N$ s.t. $\sup\{|f_n(x)-f(x)| : x \in X \}&lt;\epsilon$ for $n\ge N$</p>

<p>I'm sorry I don't have a more specific question. I just don't see the exact relation/difference between the two definitions. I've asked two different professors to explain this to me but neither of their explanations helped.</p>

<p>Edit: Attempting to show that uniform convergence implies pointwise convergence
if $f_n$ converges uniformly to f, then $\sup\{|f_n(x)-f(x)| : x\in X \}$ for $n\ge N$. Thus, $|f_n(x)-f(x)|&lt;\epsilon$ for $n\ge N$, which is the definition of pointwise convergence.</p>
","<p>It may help if you unfold the definition of limit in pointwise convergence.</p>

<p>Then pointwise convergence means that <em>for each</em> $x$ and $\epsilon$ you can find an $N$ such that (bla bla bla). Here the $N$ is allowed to depend <em>both</em> on $x$ and $\epsilon$.</p>

<p>In uniform convergence the requirement is strengthened. Here <em>for each</em> $\epsilon$ you need to be able to find an $N$ such that (bla bla bla) for <em>all</em> $x$ in the domain of the function. In other words $N$ can depend on $\epsilon$ but not on $x$.</p>

<p>The latter is a stronger condition, because if you have only pointwise convergence, it may be that some $\epsilon$ will require arbitrarily large $N$ for some $x$s.</p>

<p>For example, the functions $f_n(x)=\frac{x}{n}$ converge <em>pointwise</em> to the zero function on $\mathbb R$, but do not converge <em>uniformly</em>. For example, if we choose $\epsilon=1$, then the convergence condition boils down to $N&gt;|x|$. For each $x\in\mathbb R$ we can find such an $N$ easily, but there's no $N$ that works simultaneously for <em>every</em> $x$.</p>

<p>If we use polar coordinates to rewrite $f$ as follows:
$$ f(x(r,\theta),y(r,\theta)) = u(x(r,\theta),y(r,\theta))+iv(x(r,\theta),y(r,\theta)) $$
we use shorthands $F(r,\theta)=f(x(r,\theta),y(r,\theta))$ and $U(r,\theta )=u(x(r,\theta),y(r,\theta))$ and $V(r,\theta )=v(x(r,\theta),y(r,\theta))$. We derive the CR-equations in polar coordinates via the chain rule from multivariate calculus,
$$ U_r = x_ru_x + y_ru_y = \cos(\theta)u_x + \sin(\theta)u_y \ \
\text{and} \ \ U_{\theta} = x_{\theta}u_x + y_{\theta}u_y = -r\sin(\theta)u_x + r\cos(\theta)u_y $$
Likewise,
$$ V_r = x_rv_x + y_rv_y = \cos(\theta)v_x + \sin(\theta)v_y \ \
\text{and} \ \ V_{\theta} = x_{\theta}v_x + y_{\theta}v_y = -r\sin(\theta)v_x + r\cos(\theta)v_y $$
We can write these in matrix notation as follows:
$$ \left[ \begin{array}{l} U_r \\ U_{\theta} \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{ll} \cos(\theta) &amp; \sin(\theta) \\ -r\sin(\theta) &amp; r\cos(\theta) \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{l} u_x \\ u_y \end{array} \right] \ \ \text{and} \ \ 
\left[ \begin{array}{l} V_r \\ V_{\theta} \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{ll} \cos(\theta) &amp; \sin(\theta) \\ -r\sin(\theta) &amp; r\cos(\theta) \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{l} v_x \\ v_y \end{array} \right] $$
Multiply these by the inverse matrix: $\left[ \begin{array}{ll} \cos(\theta) &amp; \sin(\theta) \\ -r\sin(\theta) &amp; r\cos(\theta) \end{array} \right]^{-1} = \frac{1}{r}\left[ \begin{array}{ll} r\cos(\theta) &amp; -\sin(\theta) \\ r\sin(\theta) &amp; \cos(\theta) \end{array} \right]$ to find
$$ \left[ \begin{array}{l} u_x \\ u_y \end{array} \right] = \frac{1}{r}\left[ \begin{array}{ll} r\cos(\theta) &amp; -\sin(\theta) \\ r\sin(\theta) &amp; \cos(\theta) \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{l} U_r \\ U_{\theta} \end{array} \right] =  \left[ \begin{array}{l} \cos(\theta)U_r - \tfrac{1}{r}\sin(\theta)U_{\theta} \\ 
\sin(\theta)U_r + \tfrac{1}{r}\cos(\theta)U_{\theta} \end{array} \right] $$
A similar calculation holds for $V$. To summarize: 
$$ u_x = \cos(\theta)U_r - \tfrac{1}{r}\sin(\theta)U_{\theta} \ \ \ \ v_x = \cos(\theta)V_r - \tfrac{1}{r}\sin(\theta)V_{\theta} $$
$$ u_y =\sin(\theta)U_r + \tfrac{1}{r}\cos(\theta)U_{\theta} \ \ \ \ v_y =\sin(\theta)V_r + \tfrac{1}{r}\cos(\theta)V_{\theta} $$
The CR-equation $u_x=v_y$ yields:
$$ (A.) \ \ \cos(\theta)U_r - \tfrac{1}{r}\sin(\theta)U_{\theta} =  \sin(\theta)V_r + \tfrac{1}{r}\cos(\theta)V_{\theta} $$
Likewise the CR-equation $u_y=-v_x$ yields:
$$ (B.) \ \ \sin(\theta)U_r + \tfrac{1}{r}\cos(\theta)U_{\theta} = -\cos(\theta)V_r + \tfrac{1}{r}\sin(\theta)V_{\theta}$$
Multiply (A.) by $r\sin(\theta)$ and $(B.)$ by $r\cos(\theta)$ and subtract (A.) from (B.):
$$ \boxed{U_{\theta} = -rV_r} $$
Likewise multiply (A.) by $r\cos(\theta)$ and $(B.)$ by $r\sin(\theta)$ and add (A.) and (B.): 
$$ \boxed{rU_r = V_{\theta}} $$
Finally, recall that $z = re^{i\theta}=r(\cos(\theta)+i\sin(\theta))$ hence
\begin{align} \notag
 f'(z) &amp;= u_x+iv_x \\ \notag
       &amp;= (\cos(\theta)U_r - \tfrac{1}{r}\sin(\theta)U_{\theta})+i(\cos(\theta)V_r - \tfrac{1}{r}\sin(\theta)V_{\theta}) \\ \notag
       &amp;= (\cos(\theta)U_r + \sin(\theta)V_{r})+i(\cos(\theta)V_r - \sin(\theta)U_{r}) \\ \notag &amp;= (\cos(\theta)- i\sin(\theta))U_r + i(\cos(\theta)-i\sin(\theta))V_r  \\ \notag
       &amp;= e^{-i\theta}( U_r+iV_r)  \notag
\end{align}</p>

<p>In this case the definition is that you're taking the limit of $.9$, $.99$, $.999$, $.9999$, etc.  What does it mean to say that limit is $1$?  Well, it means that no matter how small a number $x$ you pick, I can show you a point in that sequence such that all further numbers in the sequence are within distance $x$ of $1$.  But certainly whatever number you chose your number is bigger than $10^{-k}$ for some $k$.  So I can just pick my point to be the $k$th spot in the sequence.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now, Algebraic Geometry is one of the oldest, deepest, broadest and most active subjects in Mathematics with connections to almost all other branches in either a very direct or subtle way. The main motivation started with Pierre de Fermat and René Descartes who realized that to study geometry one could work with algebraic equations instead of drawings and pictures (which is now fundamental to work with higher dimensional objects, since intuition fails there). The most basic equations one could imagine to start studying were polynomials on the coordinates of your plane or space, or in a number field in general, as they are the most basic constructions from the elementary arithmetic operations. Equations of first order, i.e. linear polynomials, are the straight lines, planes, linear subspaces and hyperplanes. Equations of second order turned out to comprise all the classical conic sections; in fact the conics classification in the affine, Euclidean and projective cases (over the real and complex numbers) is the first actual algebraic geometry problem that every student is introduced to: the classification of all possible canonical forms of polynomials of degree 2 (either under affine transformations or isometries in variables $(x,y)$, or projective transformations in homogeneous variables $[x:y:z]$). Thus the basic plane curves over the real numbers can be studied by the algebraic properties of polynomials. Working over the complex numbers is actually more natural, as it is the algebraic closure of the reals and so it simplifies a lot the study tying together the whole subject, thanks to elementary things like the fundamental theorem of algebra and the Hilbert Nullstellensatz. Besides, working within projective varieties, enlarging our ambient space with the points at infinity, also helps since then we are dealing with topologically compact objects and pathological results disappear, e.g. all curves intersect at least at a point, giving the beautiful <strong>Bézout's theorem</strong>.</p>

<p>From a purely practical point of view, one has to realize that all other analytic non-polynomial functions can be approximated by polynomials (e.g. by truncating the series), which is actually what calculators and computers do when computing trigonometric functions for example. So when any software plots a transcendental surface (or manifold), it is actually displaying a polynomial approximation (an algebraic variety). So the study of algebraic geometry in the applied and computational sense is fundamental for the rest of geometry.</p>

<p>From a pure mathematics perspective, the case of <em>projective complex algebraic geometry</em> is of central importance. This is because of several results, like Lefschetz's principle by which doing (algebraic) geometry over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $0$ is essentially equivalent to doing it over the complex numbers; furthermore, <strong>Chow's theorem</strong> guarantees that all projective complex manifolds are actually algebraic, meaning that differential geometry deals with the same objects as algebraic geometry in that case, i.e. complex projective manifolds are given by the zero locus of a finite number of homogeneous polynomials! This was strengthened by Jean-Pierre <strong>Serre's GAGA theorems</strong>, which unified and equated the study of analytic geometry with algebraic geometry in a very general setting. Besides, in the case of projective complex algebraic curves one is actually working with compact orientable real surfaces (since these always admit a holomorphic structure), therefore unifying the theory of <em>compact Riemann surfaces</em> of complex analysis with the <em>differential geometry</em> of real surfaces, the <em>algebraic topology</em> of 2-manifolds and the algebraic geometry of algebraic curves! Here one finds wonderful relations and deep results like all <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/a/47500/4058"">the consequences of the concept of degree</a>, index and curvature, linking together the milestone theorems of Gauß-Bonnet, Poincaré-Hopf and <strong>Riemann-Roch theorem</strong>! In fact the principal classification of algebraic curves is given in terms of their genus which is an invariant proved to be the same in the different perspectives: the topological genus of number of doughnut holes, the arithmetic genus of the Hilbert polynomial of the algebraic curve and the geometric genus as the number of independent holomorphic differential 2-forms over the Riemann surface. Analogously, the study of real 4-manifolds in differential geometry and differential topology is of central importance in mathematics per se but also in theoretical and mathematical physics, for example in gauge theory, so the study of complex algebraic surfaces gives results and provides tools. The full birational classification of algebraic surfaces was worked out decades ago in the <strong>Kodaira-Enriques theorem</strong> and served as a starting point to <strong>Mori's minimal model program</strong> to birationally classify all higher-dimensional (projective) complex algebraic varieties. A fundamental difference with other types of geometry is the presence of singularities, which play a very important role in algebraic geometry as many of the obstacles are due to them, but the fundamental <strong>Hironaka's resolution theorem</strong> guarantees that, at least in characteristic zero, varieties always have a smooth birational model. Also the construction and study of moduli spaces of types of geometric objects is a very important topic (e.g. <strong>Deligne-Mumford construction</strong>), since the space of all such objects is often an algebraic-geometric object itself. 
There are also many interesting problems and results in <em>enumerative geometry</em> and intersection theory, starting from the classic and amazing <strong>Cayley-Salmon theorem</strong> that all smooth cubic surfaces defined over an algebraic closed field contain exactly 27 straight lines, the <strong>Thom-Porteus formula</strong> for degeneracy loci, Schubert calculus up to modern quantum cohomology with <strong>Kontsevich's and ELSV formulas</strong>; <strong>Torelli's theorem</strong> on the reconstruction of algebraic curves from their Jacobian variety, and finally the cornerstone <strong>(Grothendieck)-<a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/a/231033/4058"">Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch theorem</a></strong> computing the number of independent global sections of vector bundles, actually their <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/a/242530/4058"">Euler-Poincaré characteristics</a>, by the intersection numbers of generic zero loci of characteristic classes over the variety.</p>

<p>Besides all this, since the foundational immense work of Alexandre Grothendieck, the subject has got very solid and abstract foundations so powerful to fuse algebraic geometry with number theory, as many were hoping before. Thus, the abstract algebraic geometry of sheaves and schemes plays nowadays a fundamental role in algebraic number theory disguised as <em>arithmetic geometry</em>. Wondeful results in <em>Diophantine geometry</em> like <strong>Faltings theorem</strong> and <strong>Mordell-Weil theorem</strong> made use of all these advances, along with the famous proof of Wiles of <strong>Fermat's last theorem</strong>. The development of abstract algebraic geometry was more or less motivated to solve the remarkable <strong><a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/q/241863/4058"">Weil conjectures</a></strong> relating the number of solutions of polynomials over finite number fields to the geometry of the complex variety defined by the same polynomials. For this, tremendous machinery was worked out, like étale cohomology. Also, trying to apply complex geometry constructions to arithmetic has led to <em>Arakelov geometry</em> and the arithmetic Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch among other results.</p>

<p>Related to arithmetic geometry, thanks to schemes, there has emerged a new subject of <em><a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/a/255440/4058"">arithmetic topology</a></em>, where properties of the prime numbers and algebraic number theory have relationships and dualities with the theory of knots, links and 3-dimensional manifolds! This is a very mysterious and interesting new topic, since knots and links also appear in theoretical physics (e.g. topological quantum field theories). Also, <em>anabelian geometry</em> interestingly has led the way to studies on the relationships between the topological fundamental group of algebraic varieties and the Galois groups of arithmetic number field extensions.</p>

<p>So, mathematicians study algebraic geometry because it is at the core of many subjects, serving as a bridge between seemingly different disciplines: from geometry and topology to complex analysis and number theory. Since in the end, any mathematical subject works within specified algebras, studying the geometry those algebras define is a useful tool and interesting endeavor in itself. In fact, the requirement of being commutative algebras has been dropped since the work of Alain Connes and the whole 'new' subject of <em>noncommmutative geometry</em> has flourished, in analytic and algebraic styles, to try to complete the geometrization of mathematics. On the other hand it attempts to give a quantum counterpart to classical geometries, something of extreme interest in fundamental physics (complex algebraic geometry and noncommutative geometry appear almost necessarily in one way or another in any attempt to unify the fundamental forces with gravity, i.e. quantum field theory with general relativity; even abstract and categorical algebraic geometry play a role in topics like homological mirror symmetry and quantum cohomology, which originated in physics).</p>

<p>Therefore, the kind of problems mathematicians try to solve in algebraic geometry are related to much of everything else, mostly: anything related to the classification (as fine as possible) of algebraic varieties (and schemes, maybe someday), their invariants, singularities, deformations and moduli spaces, intersections, their topology and differential geometry, and framing arithmetic problems in terms of geometry.

<p>In my personal case, I started as a theoretical physicists but switched completely to pure mathematics because of algebraic geometry, and I also began by self-learning. It is a very deep subject with connections to almost everything else, once one has learned enough to realize that. It is also a very demanding field because of the tremendous background one has to master, in commutative and homological algebra for example, before being able to get to the most modern and interesting results. The effort nevertheless pays off! In fact, the route through commutative algebra actually paves the way not only to algebraic geometry but to algebraic number theory and arithmetic geometry. I had a strong background in differential geometry so I arrived at algebraic geometry through complex (Kähler) geometry, and ended up fascinated by even the most abstract incarnations of it.</p>

"Importance of matrix rank","35687","","<p>What is the importance of the rank of a matrix? I know that the rank of a matrix is the number of linearly independent rows or columns (whichever is smaller). </p>

<p>Why is it a problem if a matrix is rank deficient?</p>

<p>Also, why is the smaller value between row and column the rank? </p>

<p>An intuitive or descriptive answer (also in terms of geometry) would help a lot.</p>
","<p>A rank of the matrix is probably the most important concept you learn in Matrix Algebra. There are two ways to look at the rank of a matrix. One from a theoretical setting and the other from a applied setting.</p>

<p>From a theoretical setting, if we say that a linear operator has a rank $p$, it means that the range of the linear operator is a $p$ dimensional space.
From a matrix algebra point of view, column rank denotes the number of independent columns of a matrix while row rank denotes the number of independent rows of a matrix. An interesting, and I think a non-obvious (though the proof is not hard) fact is the row rank is same as column rank. When we say a matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ has rank $p$, what it means is that if we take all vectors $x \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times 1}$, then $Ax$ spans a $p$ dimensional sub-space. Let us see this in a 2D setting. For instance, if </p>

<p>$A = \left( \begin{array}{cc}
1 &amp; 2 \\
2 &amp; 4 \end{array} \right) \in \mathbb{R}^{2 \times 2}$ and let $x = \left( \begin{array}{c}
x_1 \\
x_2 \end{array} \right) \in \mathbb{R}^{2 \times 1}$, then $\left( \begin{array}{c}
y_1 \\
y_2 \end{array} \right) = y = Ax = \left( \begin{array}{c}
x_1 + 2x_2 \\
2x_1 + 4x_2 \end{array} \right)$.</p>

<p>The rank of matrix $A$ is $1$ and we find that $y_2 = 2y_1$ which is nothing but a line passing through the origin in the plane.</p>

<p>What has happened is the points $(x_1,x_2)$ on the $x_1 - x_2$ plane have all been mapped on to a line $y_2 = 2y_1$. Looking closely, the points in the $x_1 - x_2$ plane  along the line $x_1 + 2x_2 = c = \text{const}$, have all been mapped onto a single point $(c,2c)$ in the $y_1 - y_2$ plane. So the single point $(c,2c)$  on the $y_1 - y_2$ plane represents a straight line $x_1 + 2x_2 = c$ in the $x_1 - x_2$ plane.</p>

<p>This is the reason why you cannot solve a linear system when it is rank deficient. The rank deficient matrix $A$ maps $x$ to $y$ and this transformation is neither onto (points in the $y_1 - y_2$ plane not on the line $y_2 = 2y_1$ e.g. $(2,3)$ are not mapped onto, which results in no solutions) nor one-to-one (every point $(c,2c)$ on the line $y_2 = 2y_1$ corresponds to the line $x_1 + 2x_2 =c$ in the $x_1 - x_2$ plane, which results in infinite solutions).</p>

<p>An observation you can make here is that the product of the slopes of the line $x_1 + 2x_2 = c$ and $y_2 = 2y_1$ is $-1$. This is true in general for higher dimensions as well.</p>

<p>From an applied setting, rank of a matrix denotes the <strong>information content</strong> of the matrix. The lower the rank, the lower is the ""information content"". For instance, when we say a rank $1$ matrix, the matrix can be written as a product of a column vector times a row vector i.e. if $u$ and $v$ are column vectors, the matrix $uv^T$ is a rank one matrix. So all we need to represent the matrix is $2n-1$ elements. In general, if we know that a matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ is of rank $p$, then we can write $A$ as $U V^T$ where $U \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times p}$ and is of rank $p$ and $V \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$ and is of rank $p$. So if we know that a matrix $A$ is of rank $p$ all we need is only $2np-p^2$ of its entries. So if we know that a matrix is of low rank, then we can compress and store the matrix and can do efficient matrix operations using it. The above ideas can be extended for any linear operator and these in fact form the basis for various compression techniques. You might also want to look up <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition"">Singular Value Decomposition</a> which gives us a nice (though expensive) way to make low rank approximations of a matrix which allows for compression.</p>

<p>From solving a linear system point of view, when the square matrix is rank deficient, it means that we do not have complete information about the system, ergo we cannot solve the system.</p>

"possible combinations of 3-digit","35679","","<p>How many possible combinations can a 3-digit safe code have?</p>

<p>Because there are 10 digits and we have to choice 3 digits from this,
 then we may get $10^P3$ but A author used the formula $n^r$, why is that. What the problem in my calculations?</p>
","<p>The error is exactly the one that I suspected in my comment. $_{10}P_3=\frac{10!}{3!}=10\cdot9\cdot8$. This is the number of ways of choosing a $3$-digit combination in which the three digits are all distinct: there are $10$ ways to choose the first digit, but then only $9$ choices remain for the second digit, and once those have been chosen only $8$ choices remain for the last digit.</p>

<p>The problem, however, does not require the digits to be distinct. Thus, there are $10$ choices for the first digit, and since you’re allowed to repeat digits, there are still $10$ choices available for the second digit, and again $10$ for the third. These choices can be made in $10\cdot10\cdot10=10^3$ different ways, so that’s the number of $3$-digit combinations.</p>

You can check that this matrix has the desired eigensystem.  For example,

"How to find the basis for a vector space?","35587","","<p>I've been given the following as a homework problem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Find a basis for the following subspace of $F^5$: 
  $$W = \{(a, b, c, d, e) \in F^5 \mid a - c - d = 0\}$$</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the moment, I've been just guessing at potential solutions.  There must be a better method than guess and check.</p>

<p>How do I solve this and similar problems?</p>
","<p>Let's look at the following example:</p>

<p>$$W = \{ (a,b,c,d)\in\mathbb{R}^4 \mid a+3b-2c = 0\}.$$</p>

<p>The vector space $W$ consists of all solutions $(x,y,z,w)$ to the equation
$$x + 3y - 2z = 0.$$</p>

<p>How do we write all solutions? Well, first of all, $w$ can be anything and it doesn't affect any other variable. Then, if we let $y$ and $z$ be anything we want, then that will force $x$ and give a solution. So we have three degrees of freedom: a free choice of $w$, a free choice of $z$, and a free choice of $y$. Then $x$ will be forced. This suggests dimension $3$.</p>

<p>How does the choice of $w$ affect $x$, $y$, and $z$? In absolutely no way. Since choosing $w$ does not affect $x$, $y$, or $z$, this gives the vector $(0,0,0,1)$: the choice of $w$ (the $1$) does not affect the others.</p>

<p>How does the choice of $z$ affect $x$, $y$, and $w$? It doesn't affect $y$ and $w$. But if $z=1$, then $x$ needs to be $2$: that is, we need to get two $x$s for every $z$. This gives the vector $(2,0,1,0)$. </p>

<p>Finally, now does the choice of $y$ affect $x$, $z$, and $w$? It doesn't affect $z$ and $w$ (they are free), but for every $y$, we need to have $-3$ $x$s. That gives the vector $(-3,1,0,0)$.</p>

<p>So a basis for my $W$ consists of $(-3,1,0,0)$, $(2,0,1,0)$, and $(0,0,0,1)$. You can verify that all of them lie in $W$, and that every vector in $W$ can be written as a linear combination of these three in a unique way.</p>

It alternates between something approaching $3$ from below and something approaching $5$ from above.  The lim&nbsp;inf is $3$ and the lim&nbsp;sup is $5$.</p>

<p>The inf of the whole sequence is $3-\frac12$.</p>

<p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and so on.  You see that these <b>inf</b>s are getting bigger.</p>

<p>If you look at the sequence of <b>inf</b>s, their <b>sup</b> is $3$.</p>

<p>Thus the lim&nbsp;inf is the <b>sup</b> of the sequence of <b>inf</b>s of all tail-ends of the sequence.  In mathematical notation,

","<p>You have to be careful about what you mean by ""positive (semi-)definite"" in the case of non-Hermitian matrices.  In this case I think what you mean is that all eigenvalues are
positive (or nonnegative).  Your statement isn't true if ""$A$ is positive definite"" means $x^T A x &gt; 0$ for all nonzero real vectors $x$ (or equivalently $A + A^T$ is positive definite).  For example, consider

<li><p>Identify what quantity you are trying to optimize, and whether you want to maximize it or minimize it. Give it a name (a single letter that will make it clear).</p></li>
<li><p>Draw a picture. In that picture, label any quantity that will play a role in computing the quantity you have in part 2.</p></li>
<li><p>Identify any constraints you have, and write them in terms of the labels you introduced in 3.</p></li>
<li><p>Write down a function for the quantity you want to optimize, in terms of the quantities in 3. </p></li>
<li><p>Use the constraints you have to change the function from 5 into a function of a single variable. Identify its domain in terms of the original problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Optimize the function you found in 6 the ""usual way"": if the domain is a finite closed interval, find the critical points, and evaluate at the critical points and the end points of the interval; largest value is the maximum, smallest value is the minimum. If the domain is not a finite closed interval, use other techniques you have for determining <em>whether</em> it has an absolute extreme of the kind you want and to find it.</p></li>
<li><p>Check that everything makes sense and checks out (that is, that your solution meets the constraints). Not a bad idea.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Translate your answer back into the setting of the problem.</strong> That is:</p></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>A ""Word Problem"" should have a ""Word Answer."" Always answer a 'word problem' with a sentence that describes, in <em>words</em>, the solution to the problem, including units (if applicable), etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>So let's look at your problem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If $1200\ \mathrm{cm}^2$ of material is available to make a box with a square base and an open top, find the largest possible volume of the box.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The quantity we want to optimize is the volume of the box.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let $V$ be the volume of the box. We want to find the maximum value of $V$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, let's draw a picture: we have a box with a square bottom, no top, arbitrary height. The two bottom sides are the same; let's call the length of the bottom $b$; let's call the height of the box $h$. </p>

<pre><code>        b   
   ------------
b /         / |
 /    b    /  |                b = length of the side of the base, in cm.
 ----------   |                h = height of the box, in cm.
 |         |  | h     
 |         |  |
h|        h|  |
 |         |  /
 |         | /b
 -----------
</code></pre>

<p>The constraints we have are that the total material can only be 1200 $\mathrm{cm}^2$. How much material is in the box with the open top? A base, and four sides.</p>

<p>The base uses $b^2\ \mathrm{cm}^2$ of material. Each of the sides uses $hb\ \mathrm{cm}^2$ of material. So the total material used is $b^2 + 4bh$. That is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Constraint: $b^2 + 4bh = 1200$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The volume is the area of the base times the height. That is,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$V = b^2h$. We want to find the maximum.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The volume depends on both $b$ and $h$. We want to express it as a function of a single quantity. In order to do that, we have to either write $h$ in terms of $b$, or write $b$ in terms of $h$. We will do this by using the constraint. Because in the constraint there is only one $h$, it is easier to ""solve for $h$"" than to ""solve for $b$"". We solve for $h$ so that we can ""plug in"" into $V$.
$$\begin{align*}
b^2 + 4bh &amp;= 1200\\
4bh &amp;= 1200-b^2\\
h &amp;= \frac{1200 - b^2}{4b}.
\end{align*}$$
Now we use this expression and plug it into $V$:
$$\begin{align*}
V &amp;= b^2h\\
V &amp;= b^2\left(\frac{1200-b^2}{4b}\right)\\
V &amp;= \frac{b^2(1200-b^2)}{4b}\\
V &amp;= \frac{b(1200-b^2)}{4}.
\end{align*}$$
Now we can think of $V$ as a function of the length of the base:
$$V(b) = \frac{1}{4}b(1200-b^2) = \frac{1}{4}(1200b-b^3).$$
What is the domain of our $V$? The largest that the base could possibly be is a square that uses up the entire $1200\ \mathrm{cm}^2$ of material (not much a box, but possible). This will happen if $b^2 = 1200$, or if $b=\sqrt{1200} = 10\sqrt{12} = 20\sqrt{3}$. That's the <em>largest</em> that $b$ can be. </p>

<p>What's the smallest that $b$ can be? In principle, it can be any number greater than $0$: you just make a box that is really tall. It shouldn't be allowed to be $0$, because then you don't really have a box; but then you don't really have a box if $b=20\sqrt{3}$ either, so we may as well ""throw in"" $b=0$ into the domain as well. So the domain of the function is $[0,20\sqrt{3}]$. </p>

<p>That's perfect: we have a continuous function, $V(b) = \frac{1}{4}(1200b-b^3)$, on a finite closed interval $[0,20\sqrt{3}]$. We know that the absolute maximum (which is what we are trying to find) is either at a critical point, or at an endpoint.</p>

<p>So we first find the critical points: the points where the derivative does not exist, or is zero. We have:
$$\begin{align*}
V(b) &amp;= \frac{1}{4}(1200b - b^3)\\
V&#39;(b) &amp;= \left(\frac{1}{4}(1200b - b^3)\right)&#39;\\
      &amp;= \frac{1}{4}(1200b - b^3)&#39;\\
      &amp;= \frac{1}{4}(1200 - 3b^2).
\end{align*}$$
So $V&#39;(b)$ is defined everywhere. The critical points are then only where the derivative is $0$, which is where $1200-3b^2 = 0$.
$$\begin{align*}
1200-3b^2 &amp;= 0\\
1200 &amp;= 3b^2\\
400 &amp;= b^2\\
\sqrt{400} &amp;= |b| &amp;\text{(but }b\text{ has to be positive: it&#39;s a length)}\\
\sqrt{400} &amp;= b\\
20 &amp;= b.
\end{align*}$$</p>

<p>So, the only critical point is $b=20$. The maximum has to be either at the critical point, or at an endpoint of the domain. So we just evaluate $V$ at these three points and determine which one is the largest value; that's the maximum:
$$\begin{align*}
V(0) &amp;= \frac{1}{4}(1200(0) - (0)^3) = 0;\\
V(20) &amp;= \frac{1}{4}(1200(20) - (20)^3) = \frac{1}{4}(24000 - 8000) = 4000;\\
V(20\sqrt{3}) &amp;= \frac{1}{4}\left(1200(20\sqrt{3}) - \left(20\sqrt{3}\right)^3\right)\\
&amp;= \frac{1}{4}\left( 24000\sqrt{3} - 24000\sqrt{3}\right)\\
&amp;= 0.
\end{align*}$$
So the largest value occurs at $b=20$.</p>

<p>What does that mean in terms of the original problem? Our box will have a base that is $20$ centimeters on each side, and height will be
$$h = \frac{1200-b^2}{4b} = \frac{1200 - (20)^2}{4(20)} = \frac{1200 - 400}{80} = 10\ \text{cm}.$$
Our ""optimal box"" will have a base that is 20 cm by 20 cm, height 10 cm, and volume 4000 cubic centimeters.</p>

<p>Let's do a check: if the base is $20\times 20\ \text{cm}^2$ and the height is $10$ cm, how much material have we used? The base is $20\times 20 = 400\ \text{cm}^2$. Each side is $20\times 10 = 200\ \text{cm}^2$, and we have four sides. So the total amount of material used on the sides is $4\times 200 = 800\ \text{cm}^2$. Base and sides together <em>do</em> amount to $1200\ \text{cm}^2$ of material. Good.</p>

<p>Now, let's go back and read the question: what are they asking us? The <em>volume</em> of the largest box under the given constraints. So:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Answer.</strong> The largest possible volume for a box with a square bottom and no top that is constructed out of 1200 $\mathrm{cm}^2$ of material is 4000 $\mathrm{cm}^3$. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You may also want to add:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is achieved by the box  of height $10$ cm and base $20$ cm by $20$ cm. </p>

","<p>Welcome to math.stackexchange!</p>

<p>A plane can be defined by three things: a point, and two non-colinear vectors in the plane (think of them as giving the plane a grid or coordinate system, so you can move from your first point to any other using them).</p>

<p>So first, we need an initial point: since there are many points in the plane, we can pick randomly. I'll just take $x_1=6,x_2=0$ so that $x_3=0$ and we see that the point $(6,0,0)$ solves the equation. </p>

<p>Now I need two vectors in the plane. I can do this by finding two other points in the plane, and subtracting them from this one (the difference of two vectors points from one to the other, so if both points are in the plane their difference will point along it). I'll take the points $(0,-3,0)$, and $(0,0,2)$. Notice the simple construction of all my points: set two variables to zero and find out what the third one should be. You can almost always do this, and it's probably the easiest way to go.</p>

<p>So my vectors are going to be these two points minus the original one I found. $$(0,-3,0)-(6,0,0)=(-6,-3,0)$$
$$(0,0,2)-(6,0,0)=(-6,0,2)$$
Now any vector in the plane, when scaled, is still in the plane. So I can define my plane like this:
$$(6,0,0)+(-6,-3,0)t+(-6,0,2)s$$</p>

<p>I.e. start at the first point, and move $t$ amount in one direction and $s$ amount in another, where $t$ and $s$ range over the real numbers, so they cover the whole plane. Note that each of the scaled vectors, when plugged into the equation, give $0$. So for any point here, we're doing $6+0+0=6$, which solves the original equation. Splitting this up in terms of components $(x_1,x_2,x_3)$ instead of points, we get
$$x_1=6-6t-6s$$
$$x_2=-3t$$
$$x_3=2s$$</p>

"Difference between ""undefined"" and ""does not exist""","35348","","<p>What is the difference between the terms ""undefined"" and ""does not exist"", especially in the context of differential calculus?  </p>

<p>Most calculus materials state, for example, that $\frac{d}{dx}{|x|}$ <strong>does not exist</strong> at $x = 0$.  Why don't we say that the derivative is <strong>undefined</strong> at $x = 0$?</p>
","<p>In the particular example you gave: The derivative is defined as a limit $\lim_{h\to 0} (f(x+h) - f(x))/h$ and, as it is with limits, this limit may or may not exist. In the case $f(x) = |x|$ and $x=0$ the limit just <strong>does not exist</strong> and hence, this is the right wording. On the other hand there <em>are</em> possible definitions of a derivative of $f(x) = |x|$ at zero (e.g. using convex analysis one may define it to be the whole interval $[-1,1]$) and hence, it seems appropriate to say that the derivative <strong>is undefined</strong>.</p>

<p>In general ""does not exists"" and ""is undefined"" are very different things at a practical level. The former says that there is a definition for something which does not lead to a mathematical object in a specific case. The latter says that there is just no definition for a specific case. Of course, one can interchange both formulation some times (as in you example, at least in my opinion). </p>

<p>How can we calculate the pdf of $v-u$?</p>
","<p>I too prefer to call the random variables $X$ and $Y$.  You can think of $X$ and $Y$ as waiting times for two independent things (say $A$ and $B$ respectively) to happen.  Suppose we wait until the first of these happens.  If it is $A$, then (by the lack-of-memory property of the exponential distribution) the further waiting time until $B$ happens still has the same
exponential distribution as $Y$; if it is $B$, the further waiting time until $A$ happens still has the same exponential distribution as $X$.  That says that the conditional distribution of $X-Y$ given $X &gt; Y$ is the distribution of $X$, and the conditional distribution of $X-Y$ given $X &lt; Y$ is the distribution of $-Y$.  Since $P(X&gt;Y) = \frac{\lambda}{\mu+\lambda}$, that says the PDF for $X-Y$ is
$$ f(x) = \frac{\lambda \mu}{\lambda+\mu}

$$\left(\begin{array}{c}x\\y\\z\end{array}\right) = A + t(B-A) = \left(\begin{array}{c}a_1\\a_2\\a_3\end{array}\right) + t\left(\begin{array}{c}b_1-a_1\\b_2-a_2\\b_3-a_3\end{array}\right),\quad t\in\mathbb{R}.$$</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The two lines intersect if and only if there is a solution $s,t$ to the system of linear equations
$$\begin{array}{rcl}
a_1 + t(b_1-a_1) &amp;= c_1 + s(d_1-c_1)\\

a_3 + t(b_3-a_3) &amp;= c_3 + s(d_3-c_3).

If $(s_0,t_0)$ is a solution to this system, then plugging in $t_0$ to the equation for $L_1$ or $s_0$ to the equation for $L_2$ yields thep oint of intersection.</p>

0 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 \\

2 &amp; 0 &amp; -6 &amp; 9 &amp; 7
\end{bmatrix}.$$</p>

<p>The first question was to find a basis of the column space of $A$, clearly this is simply the first $3$ column vectors (by reducing it to row echelon form, and finding the leading $1$'s).</p>

<p>However, then I had to find an <strong>orthogonal</strong> basis out of the column space of $A$, and here is where I get lost. I started off with finding the first vector:</p>

<p>$$u_1 = \begin{bmatrix}0\\0\\2\\2\\\end{bmatrix}.$$ </p>

<p>Then I thought I would find the second vector like this:</p>

<p>$$u_2 = \begin{bmatrix}2\\0\\2\\0\\\end{bmatrix}-\left(\begin{bmatrix}2\\0\\2\\0\\\end{bmatrix}\cdot\begin{bmatrix}0\\0\\2\\2\\\end{bmatrix}\right)*\begin{bmatrix}0\\0\\2\\2\\\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}2\\0\\2\\0\\\end{bmatrix}-4*\begin{bmatrix}0\\0\\2\\2\\\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}2\\0\\-6\\-8\\\end{bmatrix}.$$</p>

<p>However, according to the result sheet we were given, instead of having a $4$, I should have $\frac{4}{8}$. I somehow can not figure out what I am missing, since the dot product of the two vectors clearly is $4$.</p>

<p>Also, as a second question: if I had to find a orthonormal basis I would only have to take the orthogonal vectors found here, and multiply them by their $1$/length, correct?</p>
","<p>Your basic idea is right. However, you can easily verify that the vectors $u_1$ and $u_2$ you found are not orthogonal by calculating
$$&lt;u_1,u_2&gt; = (0,0,2,2)\cdot \left( \begin{matrix} 2 \\ 0 \\ -6 \\ -8 \end{matrix} \right) = -12-16 = -28 \neq 0$$
So something is going wrong in your process.</p>

<p>I suppose you want to use the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram%E2%80%93Schmidt_process"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gram-Schmidt Algorithm</a> to find the orthogonal basis. I think you skipped the normalization part of the algorithm because you only want an orthogonal basis, and not an orthonormal basis. However even if you don't want to have an ortho<strong>normal</strong> basis you have to take care about the normalization of your projections. If you only do $u_i&lt;u_i,u_j&gt;$ it will go wrong. Instead you need to normalize and take $u_i\frac{&lt;u_i,u_j&gt;}{&lt;u_i,u_i&gt;}$. If you do the normalization step of the Gram-Schmidt Algorithm, of course $&lt;u_i,u_i&gt;=1$ so it's usually left out. The Wikipedia article should clear it up quite well.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>Ok, you say that $v_1 = \left( \begin{matrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 2 \\ 2 \end{matrix} \right), v_2 = \left( \begin{matrix} 2 \\ 0 \\ 2 \\ 0 \end{matrix} \right), v_3 = \left( \begin{matrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ -5 \\ -6 \end{matrix} \right)$ is the basis you start from.
As you did you can take the first vector $v_1$ as it is. So you first basis vector is $u_1 = v_1$ Now you want to calculate a vector $u_2$ that is orthogonal to this $u_1$. Gram Schmidt tells you that you receive such a vector by</p>

<p>$$u_2 = v_2 - \text{proj}_{u_1}(v_2)$$</p>

<p>And then a third vector $u_3$ orthogonal to both of them by 
$$u_3 = v_3 - \text{proj}_{u_1}(v_3) - \text{proj}_{u_2}(v_3)$$</p>

<p>You did do this approach. What went wrong is your projection. You calculated it as
$$ \text{proj}_{u_1}(v_2) = v_2&lt;u_1,v_2&gt;$$
but this is incorrect. The true projection is 
$$ \text{proj}_{u_1}(v_2) = v_2\frac{&lt;u_1,v_2&gt;}{&lt;u_1,u_1&gt;}$$
As I tried to point out, some textbooks will skip the division by $&lt;u_1,u_1&gt;$ in the explanation of Gram-Schmidt, but this is because in most cases you want to construct an orthonormal basis. In that case you normalize every $u_i$ before proceeding to the next step. Therefore $&lt;u_i,u_i&gt; = 1$ can be skipped.</p>

<p>So what you need to change is to divide by $&lt;u_2,u_2&gt; = 8$ in your projection.</p>

<p>Right now, I only know that when we are searching for intersection with $x$, we take $y=0$ and when we search for $y$, we take $x=0$.</p>

<p>However, if the intersection with $y$-axis, $x=0$, then we get, $f(x)=0+0-0-1$, therefore it will be, $(0,-1)$, but when we search for $x$-axis, $y=0$, what do change $0$ for? There is no $y$ in the function.</p>
","<p>Remember that $y=f(x)$, therefore saying $y=0$ is saying $f(x)=0$. So you just need to find $x$ such that $x^3+x^2-x-1=0$. To do this first inspect for pretty numbers like small (in absolute value) integers.</p>

<p>Below is the graph for your function (though that's probably what you're trying to find, I'm using it just as an illustrative example, I could have chosen a different function).</p>

<p>When does the graph intersect the $y$-axis? Exactly when $x=0$. And when does it intersect the $x$-axis? Exactly when $f(x)=0$.</p>

<p>Also take notice of Brian M. Scott's comment below, which is helpful.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/McyT8.png"" alt=""Graph""></p>

<p>By looking at the graph you can find that the points in which the graph intersects the $x$-axis are $(-1,0)$ and $(1,0)$ (note that the $y$ coordinate just had to be $0$, otherwise it wouldn't intersect the $x$-axis. Also looking at the graph you see that the point which intersects the $y$-axis is $(0,-1)$ (again, the $x$ component had to be $0$, otherwise it wouldn't intersect the $y$ axis).</p>

<p>Now let's confirm this fact algebraically:</p>

<ol>
<li>Find the intersection with the $x$-axis. Set $y=0$, that is $f(x)=0$. So you're trying to find $x$ such that $x^3+x^2-x-1=0$, which is equivalent to $(x-1)(x+1)^2=0$. So you get $x=1$ and $x=-1$ as roots of the equation. Since $y=0$, you get the intersecting points $(-1,0)$ and $(1,0)$, as expected.</li>
<li>Find the intersection with the $y$-axis. Set $x=0$. You get $f(0)=y$ which is equivalent to $-1=y$. Therefore the point in which the graph of the function intersects the $y$-axis is $(0, -1)$.</li>

"Difference between Fourier transform and Wavelets","35041","","<p>While understanding difference between wavelets and Fourier transform I came across this point in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelet#Comparisons_with_Fourier_transform_.28continuous-time.29"">Wikipedia</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The main difference is that wavelets are localized in both time and frequency whereas the standard Fourier transform is only localized in frequency.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I did not understand what is meant here by ""localized in time and frequency.""</p>

<p>Can someone please explain what does this mean?</p>
","<p>Very roughly speaking: you can think of the difference in terms of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle"">Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle</a>, one version of which says that ""bandwidth"" (frequency spread) and ""duration"" (temporal spread) cannot be both made arbitrarily small. </p>

<p>The classical Fourier transform of a function allows you to make a measurement with 0 bandwidth: the evaluation $\hat{f}(k)$ tells us precisely the size of the component of frequency $k$. But by doing so you lose all control on spatial duration: you do not know when in time the signal is sounded. This is the limiting case of the Uncertainty Principle: absolute precision on frequency and zero control on temporal spread. (Whereas the original signal, when measured at a fixed time, gives you only absolute precision on the amplitude at that fixed time, but zero information about the frequency spectrum of the signal, and represents the other extreme of the Uncertainty Principle.) </p>

<p>The wavelet transform take advantage of the intermediate cases of the Uncertainty Principle. Each wavelet measurement (the wavelet transform corresponding to a fixed parameter) tells you something about the temporal extent of the signal, as well as something about the frequency spectrum of the signal. That is to say, from the parameter $w$ (which is the analogue of the frequency parameter $k$ for the Fourier transform), we can derive a characteristic frequency $k(w)$ and a characteristic time $t(w)$, and say that our initial function includes a signal of ""roughly frequency $k(w)$"" that happened at ""roughly time $t(w)$"". </p>

<hr>

<p>How is this helpful? Let us say we are looking at the signal of the light emitted from a traffic light. So for some time it will be red, and for some time it will be green (ignore the yellow for now). If we take the Fourier transform of the observed frequency, we can say that</p>

<ul>
<li>At some time the traffic light shows red. (We know frequency to infinite precision, and that the red part of the signal is non-zero.)</li>
<li>At some time the traffic light shows green. </li>
</ul>

<p>But a functioning traffic light would have either red or green shown at a time, and not both. And if the traffic light malfunctions and shows both lights at the same time, we would still see from the Fourier transform</p>

<ul>
<li>At some time the traffic light shows red.</li>
<li>At some time the traffic light shows green. </li>
</ul>

<p>But if we take the wavelet transform we can sacrifice frequency precision to gain temporal information. So with the wavelet transform done on the working traffic light we may see</p>

<ul>
<li>At parameter $w$ which corresponds roughly to $t(w)$ being 1 o'clock sharp and $k(w)$ corresponding to red, the wavelet transform is large and non-zero. This can be taken to mean that sometime around 1 o'clock sharp (could be exactly 1 o'clock, could be 1 minute past, could be 30 second before) the light showed a color that is more or less red (could be a little bit purple, or maybe a little bit amber). </li>
<li>At parameter $w$ which corresponds roughly to $t(w)$ being 1 o'clock sharp and $k(w)$ corresponding to green, the wavelet transform is almost zero. This can be taken to mean that at all the times around 1 o'clock (say plus or minus 2 minutes) the traffic light does not show any hint of green. </li>
<li>At parameter $w$ which corresponds roughly to $t(w)$ being five minutes past 1 and $k(w)$ corresponding to green, the wavelet transform is large and non-zero. This would indicate that around 1:05 (maybe 1:06, or 1:04) the light shined greenish (could have a tinge of teal or a bit of yellow in it). </li>
</ul>

<p>This would tell us that not only can the traffic light show both red and green lights, that at least at around 1 o'clock the light is working properly and only showing one light. </p>

"How to Prove the divisibility rule for $3$","34970","","<p>The divisibility rule for $3$ is well-known: if you add up the digits of $n$ and the sum is divisible by $3$, then $n$ is divisible by three.  This is quite helpful for determining if really large numbers are multiples of three, because we can recursively apply this rule:</p>

<p>$$1212582439 \rightarrow 37 \rightarrow 10\rightarrow 1 \implies 3\not\mid 1212582439$$
$$124524 \rightarrow 18 \rightarrow 9 \implies 3\mid 124524$$</p>

<p>This works for as many numbers as I've tried.  However, I'm not sure how this may be <em>proven</em>.  Thus, my question is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given a positive integer $n$ and that $3\mid\text{(the sum of the digits of $n$)}$, how may we prove that $3\mid n$?</p>
</blockquote>
","<p>HINT: Suppose that you have a four-digit number $n$ that is written $abcd$. Then</p>

<p>$$\begin{align*}
n&amp;=10^3a+10^2b+10c+d\\
&amp;=(999+1)a+(99+1)b+(9+1)c+d\\

"Why does the harmonic series diverge but the p-harmonic series converge","34899","","<p>I am struggling understanding intuitively why the harmonic series diverges but the p-harmonic series converges. I know there are methods and applications to prove convergence, but I am only having trouble understanding intuitively why it is. I know I must never trust my intuition, but this is hard for me to grasp. In both cases, the terms of the series are getting smaller, hence are approaching zero, but they both result in different answers.
$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n}=1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{4}+\cdots = \text{diverges}$$   $$\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^2}=1+\frac{1}{2^2}+\frac{1}{3^2}+\frac{1}{4^2}+\cdots =\text{converges}$$</p>
","<p>Firstly, you should always use your intuition. If you find that your intuition was correct, then smile. If you find that your intuition was wrong, use the experience to fine-tune your intuition. </p>

<p>I hope I'm interpreting you question correctly - here goes. Since you are not interested in any of the proofs, I'll just focus on intuition. Now, let's consider a series of the from $\sum _n \frac{1}{n^p}$, with $p&gt;0$ a parameter. Intuitively, the convergence or divergence of the series depends on how fast the general term $\frac{1}{n^p}$ tends to $0$. This is so because the sum is that of infinitely many positive quantities. If these quantities converge to $0$ too slow, the number of summands in each partial sum will be more dominant than the magnitude of the summands. However, if the quantities converge to $0$ fast enough, then in each partial sum the magnitude of the summands will be dominated by numbers of small magnitude, and thus outweigh the fact that there are lots of summands. </p>

<p>So, the question is how fast does $\frac{1}{n^p}$ converge to $0$. Let's look at some extreme values of $p$. If $p$ is very large, say $p=1000$, then $\frac{1}{n^p}$ becomes very small very fast (experiment with computing just a few values to see that). So, when $p$ is large, it seems the general term converges to $0$ very fast, and thus we'd expect the series to converge. However, if the value of $p$ is very small, say $p=\frac{1}{1000}$, then $\frac{1}{n^p}$ is actually pretty large for the first few possibilities for $n$, and while it does monotonically tend to $0$, it does so very slowly. So, we'd expect the series to diverge when $p$ is small. </p>

<p>Now, if $0&lt;p&lt;q$ then $\frac{1}{n^q}&lt;\frac{1}{n^p}$, so the bigger the parameter the faster the convergence of the general term to $0$ gets. So, small values for the parameter imply diverge of the series, while large values of the parameter imply convergence of the series. So, somewhere in the middle there has to be a value $b$ for the parameter such that if $p&lt;b$ then the series diverges, while if $p&gt;b$ then the series converges. </p>

<p>So, just by this straightforward analysis of the behaviour with respect to varying the parameter $p$, we know (intuitively) that there must be some cut-off value for $p$ that is the gateway between convergence and divergence. What happens at the that gateway value for $p$ is unclear, and there is no compelling reason to suspect one behaviour of the series over another. Now, the particular whereabouts of that special gateway value for $p$ should depend strongly on the particularities of the general term. This is thus where you'll have to delve into more rigorous proofs. </p>

<p>I hope this rather lengthy answer addresses what you were wondering about. Basically, it says that a cutoff parameter must exist, but we can't expect to say anything about its whereabouts nor the behaviour at that cutoff value without careful study of the general terms. </p>

"Why use Gauss Jordan Elimination instead of Gaussian Elimination, Differences","34864","","<p>Why use Gaussian Elimination instead of Gauss Jordan Elimination and vice versa for solving systems of linear equations? What are the differences, benefits of each, etc.?</p>

<p>I've just been solving linear equation systems, of the form Ax = B, by reducing matrix A to a diagonal matrix where every nonzero value equals 1. I'm not exactly sure if this would be considered Gaussian Elimination or Gauss-Jordan Elimination. </p>
","<p>Gaussian Elimination helps to put a matrix in row echelon form, while Gauss-Jordan Elimination puts a matrix in reduced row echelon form. For small systems (or by hand), it is usually more convenient to use Gauss-Jordan elimination and explicitly solve for each variable represented in the matrix system. However, Gaussian elimination in itself is occasionally computationally more efficient for computers. Also, Gaussian elimination is all you need to determine the rank of a matrix (an important property of each matrix) while going through the trouble to put a matrix in reduced row echelon form is not worth it to only solve for the matrix's rank.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:
Here are some abbreviations to start off with:
REF = ""Row Echelon Form"". RREF = ""Reduced Row Echelon Form.""</p>

<p>In your question, you say you reduce a matrix A to a diagonal matrix where every nonzero value equals 1. For this to happen, you must perform <em>row operations</em> to ""pivot"" along each entry along the diagonal. Such row operations usually involve multiplying/dividing by nonzero scalar multiples of the row, or adding/subtracting nonzero scalar multiples of one row from another row. My interpretation of REF is just doing row operations in such a way to avoid dividing rows by their pivot values (to make the pivot become 1). If you go through each pivot (the numbers along the diagonal) and divide those rows by their leading coefficient, then you will end up in RREF. See these <a href=""https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/vectors_and_spaces/matrices_elimination/v/matrices--reduced-row-echelon-form-1"" rel=""noreferrer"">Khan Academy videos</a> for worked examples.</p>

<p>In a system $Ax=B$, $x$ can only be solved for if $A$ is invertible. Invertible matrices have several important properties. The most useful property for your question is that their RREF is the identity matrix (a matrix with only 1's down the diagonal and 0's everywhere else). If you row-reduce a matrix and it does not become an identity matrix in RREF, then that matrix was non-invertible. Non-invertible matrices (also known as <em>singular</em> matrices) are not as helpful when trying to solve a system exactly.</p>

"How are the Taylor Series derived?","34803","","<p>I know the Taylor Series are infinite sums that represent some functions like $\sin(x)$. But it has always made me wonder how they were derived? How is something like $$\sin(x)=\sum\limits_{n=0}^\infty \dfrac{x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!}\cdot(-1)^n = x-\dfrac{x^3}{3!}+\dfrac{x^5}{5!}-\dfrac{x^7}{7!}\pm\dots$$ derived, and how are they used? Thanks in advance for your answer.</p>
","<p>This is the general formula for the Taylor series:</p>

<p>$$\begin{align} &amp;f(x) \\ &amp;= f(a) + f'(a) (x-a) + \frac{f''(a)}{2!} (x - a)^2 + \frac{f^{(3)}(a)}{3!} (x - a)^3 + \dots + \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!} (x - a)^n + \cdots \end{align}$$</p>

<p>You can find a proof <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/472960/prove-taylor-expansion-with-mean-value-theorem"">here</a>.</p>

<p>The series you mentioned for $\sin(x)$ is a special form of the Taylor series, called the Maclaurin series, centered $a=0$. </p>

<p>The Taylor series is an extremely powerful because it shows that every function can be represented as an infinite polynomial (with a few disclaimers, such as interval of convergence)! This means that we can differentiate a function as easily as we can differentiate a polynomial, and we can compare functions by comparing their series expansions. </p>

<p>For instance, we know that the Maclaurin series expansion of $\cos(x)$ is $1-\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^4}{4!}-\dots$ and we know that the expansion of $\sin(x)$ is  $x-\dfrac{x^3}{3!}+\dfrac{x^5}{5!}-\dfrac{x^7}{7!}\dots$. If we do term-by-term differentiation, we can clearly confirm that the derivative of $\sin(x)$ is $\cos(x)$ by differentiating its series.</p>

<p>We can also use the Maclaurin series to prove that $e^{i\theta}=\cos{\theta}+i\sin{\theta}$ and thus $e^{\pi i}+1=0$ by comparing their series: </p>

<p>$$\begin{align}
 e^{ix} &amp;{}= 1 + ix + \frac{(ix)^2}{2!} + \frac{(ix)^3}{3!} + \frac{(ix)^4}{4!} + \frac{(ix)^5}{5!} + \frac{(ix)^6}{6!} + \frac{(ix)^7}{7!} + \frac{(ix)^8}{8!} + \cdots \\[8pt]
        &amp;{}= 1 + ix - \frac{x^2}{2!} - \frac{ix^3}{3!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} + \frac{ix^5}{5!} - \frac{x^6}{6!} - \frac{ix^7}{7!} + \frac{x^8}{8!} + \cdots \\[8pt]
        &amp;{}= \left( 1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} - \frac{x^6}{6!} + \frac{x^8}{8!} - \cdots \right) + i\left( x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \frac{x^7}{7!} + \cdots \right) \\[8pt]
        &amp;{}= \cos x + i\sin x \ .
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>Also, you can use the first few terms of the Taylor series expansion to approximate a function if the function is close to the value on which you centered your series. For instance, we use the approximation $\sin(\theta)\approx \theta$ often in differential equations for very small values of $\theta$ by taking the first term of the Maclaurin series for $\sin(x).$</p>

<p>b.) How can I do this?</p>
","<p>This has undoubtedly been answered (likely multiple times) here before, so I post this at the risk of beating a dead (and decaying) horse.</p>

<p>Let me first link you to <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/56307/simultaneous-diagonalization"">this</a> page, which contains two excellent answers (I particularly recommend Keith Conrad's expository paper linked in Pierre-Yves Gaillard's answer). However, let me provide a perhaps more elementary viewpoint since, from experience, many people beginning this topic are not quite comfortable with minimal polynomial based arguments yet.</p>

<p>You seem to have covered part a quite adequately so let me focus on part b. I apologize in advance for the length, but I feel that this is a topic which requires thorough understanding.</p>

<p>The main thing to remember about commuting matrices is the fact that commuting matrices <em>respect each other's eigenspaces</em>. What does this mean? To talk about that, we first have to introduce the topic of an <strong>invariant subspace</strong>. </p>

<p>Consider a matrix mapping $A:\ V \rightarrow V$ for a vector space $V$. If there is some subspace $U$ of $V$ such that the <em>restriction</em> of $A$ to $U$ remains an operator in the sense that $A:\ U\rightarrow U$, then we say that $U$ is an <strong>invariant subspace</strong> of $A$. The term <strong>stable</strong> is also sometimes used. The significance of this is that $A(U) \subseteq U$, the image of $U$ is entirely contained within $U$. This way, it makes sense to talk about a restriction of the mapping to the smaller vector space $U$. </p>

<p>This is desirable for several reasons, the main one being that linear mappings on smaller vector spaces are easier to analyze. We can look at the action of the mapping on each invariant subspace and then piece them together to get an overall picture. This is what <em>diagonalization</em> does; we break down the vector space into smaller invariant subspaces, the <em>eigenspaces</em>, and then piece together the facts to get a simpler picture of how the mapping works. Many of the simpler, canonical representations are dependent on this fact (for example, the Jordan canonical form looks at the invariant <em>generalized eigenspaces</em>).</p>

<p>Now, if we have two commuting, diagonalizable matrices, then each eigenspace of $B$ is not only invariant under $B$ itself, but also under $A$. This is what we mean by <em>preserving each other's eigenspaces</em>. To see this, let $\mathbf{v}$ be an eigenvector of $B$ under eigenvalue $\lambda$. Then
$$B(A\mathbf{v}) = A(B\mathbf{v}) = \lambda A\mathbf{v}$$
so that $A\mathbf{v}$ is again an eigenvector of $B$ under eigenvalue $\lambda$. In our new language, this means that the eigenspace $E_\lambda$ of $B$ is <em>invariant</em> under $A$. This means it makes sense to look at the restriction of $A$ to $E_\lambda$.</p>

<p>Now consider the restriction of $A$. If all the eigenvalues of $B$ are simple (multiplicity one) then that means each eigenspace of $B$ is one dimensional. We have therefore restricted $A:\ E_\lambda \rightarrow E_\lambda$ to a mapping on a one-dimensional vector space. But this means that $A$ must take each vector of $E_\lambda$ to a scalar multiple of itself. You can check that this necessarily implies that $E_\lambda$ is also an <em>eigenspace of</em> $A$. Therefore, for any eigenbasis of $B$ that we take, the corresponding vectors also form an eigenbasis of $A$. This means that the two matrices are simultaneously diagonalizable; they share a common eigenbasis.</p>

<p>The general case is a bit more involved in that the restrictions to the invariant subspaces are more complex (they're no longer one-dimensional), but the ideas are identical.</p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> Since you seem to be interested in physics, let me mention a crucial application of commuting operators. In quantum mechanics, you have quantities called <em>observables</em>, each of which is <em>roughly speaking</em> represented by a Hermitian matrix. Unlike in classical physics, different observables need not be simultaneously measurable (by measuring position for example, you cannot simultaneously measure momentum and vice versa) which is ultimately due to the fact that the position operator and the momentum operator do not commute (this is the underlying reasons behind the <em>uncertainty principle</em>). They do not have a shared basis which can represent the states of a system. Commuting operators therefore form a key element of quantum physics in that they define quantities which are <em>compatible</em>, i.e. simultaneously defined.</p>

<p>By the way, I am using $FT(f)(k)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x)e^{-ikx}\,dx$ as my definition of a Fourier transform.</p>

<p>Many thanks.</p>
","<p>First we consider the case $m=0$ and $n=1$, i.e. $f(x) := \exp(-x^2)$ and $$\hat{f}(k) := \int_{\mathbb{R}} f(x) \cdot e^{-\imath \, k x} \, dx = \int_{\mathbb{R}} \exp \left(-x^2 \right) \cdot e^{-\imath \, k \cdot x} \, dx.$$ 
Differentiating with respect to $k$ yields $$\frac{d}{dk} \hat{f}(k) = \int_{\mathbb{R}} e^{-x^2} \cdot (-\imath \, x) \cdot e^{-\imath \, k x} \, dx = \frac{1}{2} \imath \int_{\mathbb{R}} \left( \frac{d}{dx} e^{-x^2} \right)  \cdot e^{-\imath \, k x} \, dx.$$</p>

<p>Applying the integration by parts formula, we obtain</p>

<p>$$\frac{d}{dk} \hat{f}(k) = - \frac{1}{2} k \cdot \int_{\mathbb{R}} e^{-x^2} \cdot e^{-\imath \, k \, x} \, dx =- \frac{1}{2} k \cdot \hat{f}(k).$$</p>

<p>The unique solution to this ordinary differential equation is given by</p>

<p>$$\hat{f}(k) =c \cdot \exp \left(- \frac{k^2}{4} \right).$$</p>

<p>Since $c=\hat{f}(0) = \int_{\mathbb{R}} f(x) \, dx$, it follows that $c = \sqrt{\pi}$. Moreover, applying the following well-known formulas</p>

<p>$$\begin{align} \widehat{f(x+m)}(k) &amp;= e^{\imath \, k \cdot m} \hat{f}(k) \\
\widehat{f(\alpha \cdot x)}(k) &amp;= \frac{1}{\alpha} \cdot \hat{f} \left( \frac{k}{\alpha} \right) \qquad \alpha&gt;0, \end{align}$$</p>

<p>one can calculate the fourier transform of $f(x) = \exp \left(-n^2 \cdot (x-m)^2 \right)$ by some straight-forward computations.</p>

<p>What is the proof that, for all arbitrary values of $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ vector sets, the covariance matrix $C$ is always semi-definite ($C \succeq0$) (i.e.; not negative definte; all of its eigenvalues are non-negative)?</p>
","<p>A symmetric matrix $C$ of size $n\times n$ is semi-definite if and only if $u^tCu\geqslant0$ for every $n\times1$ (column) vector $u$, where $u^t$ is the $1\times n$ transposed (line) vector. If $C$ is a covariance matrix in the sense that $C=\mathrm E(XX^t)$ for some $n\times 1$ random vector $X$, then the linearity of the expectation yields that $u^tCu=\mathrm E(Z_u^2)$, where $Z_u=u^tX$ is a real valued random variable, in particular $u^tCu\geqslant0$ for every $u$. </p>

<p>If $C=\mathrm E(XY^t)$ for two centered random vectors $X$ and $Y$, then $u^tCu=\mathrm E(Z_uT_u)$ where $Z_u=u^tX$ and $T_u=u^tY$ are two real valued centered random variables. Thus, there is no reason to expect that $u^tCu\geqslant0$ for every $u$ (and, indeed, $Y=-X$ provides a counterexample).</p>

"The cross product of two sets","34700","","<p>Just reading about the cross product. It says here:
$$A\times B= \{(x,y)|x\in A, y\in B\}$$
Does this mean that the result of $A\times B$ is a new set of ordered pairs? If so, what happens if both A and B share a common member? What would the result be, since an ordered pair cannot include duplicates?</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit: Quoting the free textbook I'm looking at online,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If we are given that A is a set and no other information about A, then there is no
  ordering to the elements of A. Thus, we cannot speak of “the second element of the set A”
  unless we have specified an ordering of the elements of A. If we wish to regard A as ordered in some way, then we specify this fact explicitly: “The elements of A are ordered a, b, c,” or “A = (a, b, c).” The latter notation replaces the braces with parentheses and designates that A is ordered, left to right, as indicated. We call this an ordered set. An ordered set is also called a linear order. Various other names are also used: list, vector, string, word — all with no repeated elements. Of course, you’ve seen repeated elements in vectors, for example the point in the plane at the coordinates (1,1). That’s fine, it’s just not an ordered set. </p>
  
  <p>Why is it okay to specify a set S = {a, b, c, a} where the element a has been repeated,
  but it is not okay to have repeated elements in an ordering of S?   When we say S  =
  {a, b, c, a}, we know that S contains just the three elements a, b and c.  If we were to talk
  about the ordered set (a, b, c, a) it would not make sense because it would say that the
  element a is in two places at once: the first position and the last position.</p>
</blockquote>
","<p>Yes, $A\times B$ is the (new) set of all ordered pairs $(x,y)$ with $x\in A$ and $y\in B$. There will be no problem if $A$ and $B$ share common elements since an <em>ordered</em> pair is precisely such that it can contain duplicates (an unordered pair, i.e. a set $\{a,b\}$ can not). So, for example, $A\times A$ is just the set of all ordered pairs of elements of $A$. For example, $\{1,2\}\times\{1,2\}=\{(1,1),(1,2),(2,1),(2,2)\}$.</p>

<p>EDIT: <em>Ordered</em> means that the order of the elements matters, that is, $(1,2)\ne(2,1)$ whereas $\{1,2\}=\{2,1\}$.</p>

"Is it faster to count to the infinite going one by one or two by two?","34669","","<p>A child asked me this question yesterday:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Would it be faster to count to the infinite going <em>one by one</em> or <em>two by two</em>?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I was split with two answers:</p>

<ul>
<li>In both case it will take an infinite time.</li>
<li>Skipping half of the number should be really faster.</li>
</ul>

<p>Which brings me this question:</p>

<p><strong>Could an infinite be greater than another one?</strong></p>
","<p><strong>YES</strong> and <strong>NO</strong>.</p>

<p>Galileo made the ""discovery"", the so-called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo%27s_paradox"">Galileo's paradox</a>, that if you start with the succession of natural numbers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$1, 2, 3, ...$</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and you <em>map</em> it into the succession of even numbers :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$2, 4, 6, ...$</p>
</blockquote>

<p>you may map (i.e.<em>associate</em>) every number into its double (today, we call it one-to-one mapping).</p>

<p>So, you have the same ""number"" of numbers and of even numbers.</p>

<p>Modern set theory (from Cantor on) solved the paradox extending the ""counting"" process to <em>infinite</em> sets, but proving that the euclidean <em>common notion</em> that ""The whole is greater than the part"" [see Euclid, <em>The Elements</em>, trans T.L.Heath, Dover, <em>Common notions 5</em>] will not hold for an <em>infinite</em> set.</p>

<p>According to modern set theory, the two above sets can be put in one-to-one correspondence, so they have the same <em>cardinal</em> number, and their ""type"" of infinity is called <em>denumerable</em> (a set is called <em>denumerable</em> exactly when it can be put in one-to-one correspondence with the set of natural numbers).</p>

<p>But, again by a result of Cantor, not all <em>infinite</em> sets can be put in one-to-one correspondence: there are <em>infinite</em> sets ""more infinite"" than another. A set of ""a larger kind"" of infinity is the set of <em>real numbers</em>; it is <strong>not</strong> denumerable, in the meaning defined above.</p>

<p>As for counting ""faster"": of course, if you count two by two, after a while you will be way ""ahead"" of your friend that is counting by one. The only problem is that you will not ""end"" before him, because there is no final goal to be reached!</p>

One can do arithmetic with sets in a way that leads to the arithmetic of the natural numbers: for example, taking the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint_union"">disjoint union</a> corresponds to addition, and taking the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product"">Cartesian product</a> corresponds to multiplication. These ideas lead to the arithmetic of the cardinal numbers, and similar ideas lead to the arithmetic of the ordinal numbers. </li>
<li>A <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics)"">ring</a> is a formalization of the intuitive notion of a set of things you can add and multiply, so in some sense one can regard elements of rings as ""generalized numbers"" (but note that not every generalization I listed above can be interpreted in this way). When certain people say that ""infinity is not a number,"" what they mean is that you can't adjoin an element called $\infty$ to the ring $\mathbb{R}$ of real numbers such that addition and multiplication do what you want them to do, the basic problem being that $\infty - \infty$ can't be consistently defined to satisfy the other rules of arithmetic if you also want it to be true that $n + \infty = \infty$ for any finite $n$. </li>
<li>A <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)"">field</a> is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutativity"">commutative</a> ring in which it's also possible to divide by <em>nonzero</em> elements. Some people would like to say that $\frac{1}{0} = \infty$, but by mathematical convention the element $0$ never has a multiplicative inverse in a field, the basic problem being that $0 \cdot \infty$ can't be consistently defined to satisfy the other rules of arithmetic. However, one can make sense of the expression $\frac{1}{0}$ in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_geometry"">projective geometry</a>; it describes the point at infinity on the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_line"">projective line</a>. </li>
<li>A <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space"">topological space</a> is an abstract setting for ideas like nearness and taking limits.

<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>

<p>Could anyone provide a intuitive explain to the concept and anything can help me understand?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<hr>

<p>Update:</p>

<p>I'm <strong>NOT</strong> asking <em>how to calculate degree of freedom</em>.</p>

<p>Let me give an example:</p>

<p>For Chi-squared distribution, different degree of freedom produces different probability density function. Could you explain it <strong><em>intuitively</em></strong>?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xKrbq.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>Intuitively degrees of freedom denotes how many <em>independent things</em> are there. As we introduce <em>constraints</em>, we take away the degree of freedom. </p>

<p>First I'll try to answer your question about Chi-square.</p>

<p>Chi-square distribution with $n$ degree of freedom is the sum of squares $n$ <strong>independent</strong> standard normal distributions $N(0,1)$ hence we've got $n$ <em>things</em> that vary independently. </p>

<p>I'll start with <em>mechanical</em> example, as degree of freedom is similar in every field.</p>

<p>Consider an airplane flying. It has three degrees of freedom in the usual universe of space, and can be located only if three coordinates are known. These might be latitude, longitude, and altitude; or might be altitude, horizontal distance from some origin, and an angle; or might be direct distance from some origin, and two direction angles. If we consider a given instant of time as a section through the space-time universe,  the airplane moves in a four‑dimensional path and can be located by four coordinates, the three previously named and a time coordinate.Hence it now has $4$ d.f.</p>

<p>Note that we assumed that plane is not <em>rotating</em>.</p>

<p>Now considering statistical degrees of freedom..</p>

<p>Similar meaning.</p>

<p><strong>Degree of freedom of a statistic is number of values in calculation of statistic that are independent to vary</strong>.As we add restriction to observations, we reduce the degree of freedom.Imposing a relationship upon the observations is equivalent to estimating a parameter from them. The number of degrees of freedom is equal to the number of independent observations, which is the number of original observations minus the number of parmeters estimated from them.</p>

<p>Consider the calculation of mean $\frac {\sum_{i=1}^n X_n }{n}$, we are interested in estimation of error which are estimated by residues. Sum of residuals is $0$. Knowledge of <em>any</em> $n-1$ residues gives the remaining residue. So, only $n-1$ can vary independently. Hence they have $n-1$ d.f.</p>

<p>However d.f is mainly used in regression analysis, and ANOVA. You may note that all the <em>distributions</em> with so called d.f correspond to particular cases in linear statistics. Hence d.f is at the best <em>artificial</em> as they are not <em>constraints</em> on the random variable, but are actually degree of freedom of some quantities in some application from where these distributions originated.</p>

<p>Also, For people who are interested, &lt; <a href=""http://courses.ncssm.edu/math/Stat_Inst/Worddocs/DFWalker.doc"">http://courses.ncssm.edu/math/Stat_Inst/Worddocs/DFWalker.doc</a> > seems to be quite good read.</p>

<p>My teacher let us write that inequality is satisfied for all $m$ belongs to real number however if $m=0$, $\frac{1}{m}$ is undefined. So if ""undefined"" means that <strong>""a number divided by zero may be any real or imaginary number""</strong> so then I can confess only for real numbers that inequality is satisfied for all $m$ belonging to real numbers and not for imaginary numbers since we can't make sense of a statement like this $i&gt;0$ but if the term ""undefined"", in Maths, is defined as ""Senseless"" or ""something else not known"" then I strongly apprehend that why my teacher let us write that Inequality is satisfied for all $m$ belonging to real numbers?</p>
","<p>Saying that 1 divided by 0 is undefined, does not mean that you can carry out the division and that the result is some strange entity with the property “undefined”, but simply that dividing 1 by 0 has no defined meaning.

<p>Isn't the Fourier transform of a derivative of a function just $i \omega$ times the Fourier transform of the function itself?</p>
","<p>To complement Dirk's answer:</p>

<p>Your inversion of differentiation can't work like that. There's a family of functions that differ by additive constants and all have the same derivative. Their Fourier transforms differ by deltas at the origin (proportional to the additive constants), so it can't be the case that you get the Fourier transform of all of them by dividing the transform of the derivative by $\mathrm i\omega$.</p>

<p>The catch is that multiplying by $\mathrm i\omega$ multiplies by $0$ at the origin and thus annihilates any delta that might be sitting there, and you can't reconstruct it by dividing by $\mathrm i\omega$. What you get by dividing by $\mathrm i\omega$ (if you interpret the pole appropriately) is the unique function with that derivative with zero average. In your case, that would be a step function that jumps from $-1/2$ to $1/2$.</p>

<p>Here's another way of looking at it: The function</p>

<p>$$H_\alpha(t)=\begin{cases}\mathrm e^{-\alpha t}&amp;t\ge0\\0&amp;t\lt0\end{cases}$$</p>

<p>defined in the note Dirk linked to decays at infinity and converges to the Heaviside function pointwise as $\alpha\to0$. Its Fourier transform is $\hat H(\omega)=1/(\alpha+\mathrm i\omega)$, which converges to $1/(\mathrm i\omega)$ pointwise as $\alpha\to0$, except at $\omega=0$. What you're doing corresponds to directly setting $\alpha$ to zero and using the pointwise limit as the Fourier transform. However, that ignores the fact that while the imaginary part goes to $1/(\mathrm i\omega)$, the real part has a spike at the origin, which gets narrower as $\alpha\to0$ but whose integral is independent of $\alpha$:</p>

<p>$$
\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac1{\alpha+\mathrm i\omega}\mathrm d\omega
&amp;=\int_0^{\infty}\left(\frac1{\alpha+\mathrm i\omega}+\frac1{\alpha-\mathrm i\omega}\right)\mathrm d\omega
\\

\\
&amp;=2\left[\arctan\frac \omega\alpha\right]_0^{\infty}

<p>PurpleMath never actually refers to these diagrams as sign charts either, but I assume these 'factor charts' are synonymous.</p>

<p>The first image is a sign chart for (x + 4)(x – 2)(x – 7) > 0. I know that this has roots at -4, 2, and 7. These are indicated in between columns. The factors are written along rows. The -/+ is determined by evaluating a test point in a range dependent on the columns in each factor. <em>(This is just my understanding - I could by all means be very, very incorrect.)</em> For example - cell ""B3"" - the range is -4 &lt; TEST &lt; 2. 0 is in this range, so I will evaluate (x-2) for 0. The resulting sign is -, so I mark that in cell B3. I evaluate all other cells in that column, except for the top. The top cell of each column is determined by the resulting sign of all signs below it (in column 3, - * - = +).</p>

<p>However, my intuition fails me when the problems become more complex. Take, for example,
4x^2 + 8x &lt; 6. When solved using the quadratic equation, x equals a messy (-2 +/- sqrt(10) ). I don't understand what to put along the columns and rows. What goes where?</p>

<p>What is the distance from $(x,2x+3)$ to the origin? By what I hope is a familiar formula, this distance is
$$\sqrt{(x-0)^2 +(2x+3-0)^2}.$$
This is because in general the distance between $(a,b)$ and $(c,d)$ is $\sqrt{(a-c)^2+(b-d)^2}$. Apply this formula, using $a=x$, $b=2x+3$, and $c=0$, $d=0$.</p>

<p>Alternately, you can find the distance from $(x,2x+3)$ to the origin by drawing a picture and using the Pythagorean Theorem.</p>

Let

<p>Does it converge?   If so, what is its sum?</p>
","<p>Complementary to Mau's answer:</p>

<p>Call a series $a_n$ <strong>absolutely convergent</strong> if $\sum|a_n|$ converges. If $a_n$ converges but is not absolutely convergent we call $a_n$ <strong>conditionally convergent</strong> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_series_theorem"">The Riemann series theorem</a> states that any conditionally convergent series can be reordered to converge to any real number.</p>

<p>Morally this is because both the positive and negative parts of your series diverge but the divergences cancel each other out, one or other's canceling the other can be staggered by adding on, say,  the negative bits every third term in stead of every other term. This means that in the race for the two divergences to cancel each other out, we give the positive bit something of a head-start and will get a larger positive outcome. Notice how, even in this rearranged version of the series, every term will still come up exactly once.</p>

<p>It is also worth noting, on the Wikipedia link Mau provided, that the convergence to $\ln 2$ of your series is at the edge of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius_of_convergence"">radius of convergence</a> for the series expansion of $\ln(1-x)$- this is a fairly typical occurrence: at the boundary of a domain of convergence of a Taylor series, the series is <em>only just</em> converging- which is why you see this conditional convergence type behavior. </p>

<p>Are there less painful ways to show it's not solvable? It seems like this could go on for a while with trial and error to either find an inconsistency or an answer for x y and z.</p>
","<ol>
<li><p>Yes: by showing that the system is equivalent to one in which the equation $0=3$ must hold, you have shown the original system has no solutions.</p></li>
<li><p>By definition, a system of linear equation is said to be ""consistent"" if and only if it has at least one solution; and it is ""inconsistent"" if and only if it has no solutions. So ""showing a system of linear equations is not solvable"" (has no solutions) is, <em>by definition</em>, the same thing as showing that the system of linear equations is ""inconsistent"". </p></li>
<li><p>""A system doesn't have a unique solution"" can happen in two ways: it can have <em>more</em> than one solution (in which case it has infinitely many solutions), or it can have <em>no</em> solutions. Only in the second case do we say the system is ""inconsistent"".</p></li>
<li><p>One of the easiest ways to find solutions of systems of linear equations (or show no solutions exist) is Gauss (or Gauss-Jordan) Row Reduction; it amounts to doing the kind of things you did, but in a systematic, algorithmic, recipe-like manner. You can do it almost mindlessly (or you can keep an eye out for clever actions that may save you work down the line). This process will determine, after a finite number of steps, whether the system is consistent or not, and in the case that the system is consistent, will tell you what the solutions are. </p></li>

"How do I find the standard deviation of this if I'm only given the mean?","34044","","<p>So I have this problem that goes like this: Suppose the distribution of height over a large population of individuals is approximately normal. Ten percent of individuals in the population are over 72 inches tall, while the average height is 70 inches. What, approximately, is the probability that in a group of 100 people picked at random from this populatino there will be two or more individuals over 74 inches tall? I'm really quite stuck, can the sample of the population tell us the standard deviation?</p>
","<p>It isn’t the sample that tells you $\sigma$, the standard deviation, it’s the rest of the information in the problem.</p>

<p>You’re told that the population mean is $70$ inches and that $10$% of the population is over $72$ inches tall, so $90$% of the population is at or below $72$ inches in height. Using a table of the standard normal distribution, find the $z$-score that has $90$% of the area to the left of it: it’s about $1.28$. That means that $72$ inches is about $1.28$ standard deviations above the mean of $70$ inches, so $2$ inches is about $1.28$ standard deviations. Now do a little arithmetic, and you’ll have $\sigma$.</p>

"Converting decimal(base 10) numbers to binary by repeatedly dividing by 2","33920","","<p>A friend of mine had a homework assignment where he needed to convert decimal(base 10) numbers to binary. I helped him out and explained one of the ways I was taught to do this. </p>

<p>The way I showed him was to repeatedly divide the number by 2 and then take the remainder, the binary number will be the remainders read from bottom to top. </p>

<pre><code>ex:  Convert 22 to a binary representation

22 / 2 = 11 R 0
11 / 2 = 5  R 1 
5  / 2 = 2  R 1
2  / 2 = 1  R 0
1  / 2 = 0  R 1

<p>After I showed him the algorithm and an example, he set off to do the rest of his problems. Today he sent me an email and asked me why this method works. I was sort of shocked by that question, I have never given a second thought to why this works, I only did as I was told knowing that if I performed this algorithm I would always get the right answer in binary. </p>

<p>I thought about it for awhile and still can't seem to figure out WHY this method works, any help would be appreciated. This isn't for an assignment, merely my curiosity and frustration at not asking this question before. </p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>Do you mind explaining how you went from:</p>

<p>$$n=e_0\times 2^0 + e_1\times 2^1 + \cdots + e^k\times 2^k$$ </p>

<p>to</p>

<p>$$n=e_0 + 2\Bigl(e_1 + e_2\times 2 + \cdots + e_k\times 2^{k-1}\Bigr),$$</p>

<p>I am not following the transition to the closed form.</p>
","<p>Remember the meaning of base 10 notation; when you write a number as
$$d_nd_{n-1}\cdots d_2d_1d_0$$
where $d_i$ is the $i$th digit (from right to left), what you are saying is that the number is equal to:
$$ d_0\times 10^0 + d_1\times 10^1 + d_2\times 10^2 + \cdots + d_n\times 10^n.$$
So, for example, $5381$ represents the number
$$1\times 10^0 + 8\times 10^1 + 3\times 10^2 + 5\times 10^3 = 1 + 80 + 300 + 5000.$$</p>

<p>Writing a number in binary (base 2) is meant to represent the number in exactly the same way, but with powers of $2$ in stead of powers of 10: the expression
$$e_k\cdots e_3e_2e_1e_0{}_{[2]}$$
represents the number
$$n=e_0\times 2^0 + e_1\times 2^1 + e_2\times 2^2 + e_3\times 2^3 + \cdots + e_k\times 2^k.$$</p>

<p>Since every summand except the first one is a multiple of $2$, we can write:
$$\begin{align*}
n&amp;=e_0\times 2^0 + e_1\times 2^1 + \cdots + e_k\times 2^k\\
&amp;=e_0 + \left(e_1\times 2\right) + \left(e_2\times 4\right) + \cdots \left(e_k\times 2^{k}\right)\\
&amp;= e_0 + \left( 2 \times e_1\right) + \left( 2\times (e_2\times 2)\right) + \cdots + \left(2\times(e_k\times 2^{k-1})\right)\\
&amp;= e_0 + 2\Bigl(e_1 + (e_2\times 2) + \cdots + (e_k\times 2^{k-1})\Bigr).
\end{align*}$$
That means that when you divide $n$ by $2$ you get a remainder of $e_0$ (the right-most digit of the base 2 expression of $n$), and a quotient of
$$q_1=e_1\times 2^0 + e_2\times 2^1 + \cdots + e_k\times 2^{k-1}.$$
Now you can determine the next binary digit of $n$ by repeating the process with $q_1$: we write
$$q_1 = e_1 + 2\Bigl(e_2 + e_3\times 2 + \cdots + e_k\times 2^{k-2}\Bigr),$$
so the remainder of dividing $q_1$ by $2$ is the penultimate digit of the binary expression of $n$, and the quotient is $q_3$, with
$$q_3 = e_2 + e_3\times 2 + \cdots + e_k\times 2^{k-2}.$$</p>

<p>Lather, rinse, and repeat until the remainder quotient is $0$.</p>

<p>Reflecting around $x=1$ never touches the $y$ coordinate, and the $x$ coordinate transforms - what was the distance to $x=1$ becomes the distance on the other side. In other words, if a point were at $x = \pi$, it's distance to $x=1$ was $\pi - 1$ so the new location is $\pi - 1$ to the <em>left</em> of $x=1$, i.e. $1- (\pi-1) = 2 - \pi$.</p>

","<p>Unfortunately, your update doesn't convince me you did the correct job, based on your script, your <code>x</code> variable is already the answer and residing in the workspace, the second time when your own scripts are being executed, only one iteration has been made, not the whole Newton's method.</p>

<p>If you are allowed to use <code>Symbolic Toolbox</code> to compute the Jacobian, there is a more universal way of doing instead of just carrying out a problem-oriented script. Here is a modified version to match your notation of an old implementation of mine for Newton's method, and this could be easily vectorized for a multi-dimensional nonlinear equation system using <code>varargin</code> input, and do a string size check on the inline function you passed to the following function.</p>

<pre><code>function [s J] = newton(f,p0,tol,MaxIter)

x = sym('x'); y = sym('y'); 
F = f([x,y]);
% Compute the Jacobian matrix symbolically
J = jacobian(F);

s = zeros(MaxIter,2);
s(1,:) = p0;
dsnorm = inf;
iter = 1;

while dsnorm&gt;tol &amp;&amp; iter&lt;MaxIter

    dsnorm = norm(ds,inf);
    iter = iter+1;
end
s = s(1:iter,:);

end
</code></pre>

<p>This function accepts input <code>f</code> as an inline function, <code>p0</code> is the initial guess, <code>tol</code> is the tolerance and <code>MaxIter</code> is the maximum iteration allowed, if the vectorized version of your input is:</p>

<pre><code>  &gt;&gt;f=inline('[p(:,1).^2+p(:,2).^2-2.12; ...
   p(:,2).^2-p(:,1).^2.*p(:,2)-0.04]','p');

<p>Then </p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;s = newton(f,[1 1],0.4e-6,10)

"Lambda value of Poisson distribution","33508","","<p>I'm a bit confused about the lambda value of a Poisson distribution. I know it means the average rate of success for a given interval. I'm confused about what this value exactly means through. </p>

<p>For example, If I have 2.4/100,000 people contracting a disease over a period of two years, what is the lambda value if I'm trying to figure out the probability of at least 5 cases of the disease out of 100,000 in one year? I'm not sure if it would be either 2.4/100,000 or 1.2/100,000 since the original average is over a period of two years. I'm also pondering if lambda could be 2.4 or 1.2 since the question already states a sample of only 100,000. </p>

","<p>Imagine we have a population of fixed size $100000$, say a small city. The ""two year $\lambda$"" is $2.4$. Then the ""one year $\lambda$"" is $1.2$. </p>

"The shortest distance between two parallel lines","33491","","<p>I was working on a set of problems involving finding the shortest distance between two skew lines, which was fine, but then parallel lines showed up. In essence this should be much easier to solve since I do not need to do any cross products. However I quickly got stuck.</p>

<p>Two lines are defined by the following parametric equations: $x=6t$, $y=3+8t$, $z=-1+2t$ and $x=2+3s$, $y=4s$, $z=1+s$ which can be represented as $\vec{a}=\begin{pmatrix} 6t \\ 8t+3 \\2t-1 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\vec{b}=\begin{pmatrix} 2+3s \\ 4s \\1+s \end{pmatrix}$ respectively. Therefore the line between the two is defined by the vector $$\vec{c}=\begin{pmatrix} 6t-3s-2 \\ 8t-4s+3 \\2t-s-2 \end{pmatrix}$$</p>

<p>Since the shortest line between the two lines is perpendicular to both, $\vec a \cdot\vec c=\vec b \cdot\vec c=0$. However , I have tried this and it seems overly complicated for such an easy problem. My initial thought was to find the distance between the initial coordinates of the parametric equations, but those points could be any points on the line.

"When can you switch the order of limits?","33462","","<p>Suppose you have a double sequence $\displaystyle a_{nm}$.

Bonus points for necessary and sufficient conditions.</p>

<p>For an example of a sequence where this is not the case, consider $\displaystyle a_{nm}=\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{m}}$.  $\displaystyle \lim_{n\to \infty}\,\lim_{m\to \infty}{a_{nm}}=\lim_{n\to \infty}{\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)^0}=\lim_{n\to \infty}{1}=1$, but $\displaystyle \lim_{m\to \infty}\,\lim_{n\to \infty}{a_{nm}}=\lim_{m\to \infty}{0^{\frac{1}{m}}}=\lim_{m\to \infty}{0}=0$.</p>
","<p>If you want to avoid hypotheses that involve uniform convergence, you can always cheat and use the counting measure on {0, 1, 2,...} and then use either the Monotone or Dominated Convergence Theorem from integration theory.</p>

<p>For instance, using the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotone_convergence_theorem"">Monotone Convergence Theorem</a>, we get the following (perhaps silly) sufficient criterion:</p>

<p><strong>Proposition:</strong> If $a_{mn}$ is monotonically increasing in $m$, and is such that $c_{mn} = a_{mn} - a_{m-1,n}$ is monotonically increasing in $n$, then $\lim\limits_{m \to \infty} \lim\limits_{n \to \infty} a_{mn} = \lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\lim\limits_{m\to\infty} a_{mn}$.</p>

<p><em>Proof:</em> Our two hypotheses really just amount to saying that each $c_{mn} \geq 0$ and that the $c_{mn}$ are monotonically increasing in $n$.  So we can use the Monotone Convergence Theorem with respect to the counting measure:
$$\lim_{n\to \infty} \int c_{mn} = \int \lim_{n\to \infty} c_{mn}$$
But really, these integrals are sums, so:
$$\lim_{n\to \infty} \sum_{m=1}^\infty c_{mn} = \sum_{m=1}^\infty \lim_{n\to \infty} c_{mn}$$
Since infinite sums are just limits of partial sums, we have:
$$\lim_{n\to \infty} \lim_{M \to \infty} \sum_{m=1}^M c_{mn} = \lim_{M\to\infty}\lim_{n\to \infty} \sum_{m=1}^M c_{mn}$$
By our construction of $c_{mn}$, the left side is $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} \lim\limits_{M\to\infty} a_{Mn}$, and the right side is $\lim\limits_{M\to\infty} \lim\limits_{n\to\infty}a_{Mn}$. $\lozenge$</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> In the above, our index ranges are $m,n \geq 1$, and we make the convention that $a_{0n} = 0$.</p>

<p>I've worked it out again, this is my working:</p>

<p>I put Newton's law of gravitation and the centripetal force equation equal to each other:</p>

<p>$\frac{GMm}{r^2} = \frac{mv^2}{r}$</p>

<p>Divide both sides by $r$:</p>

<p>$\frac{GMm}{r} = mv^2$</p>

<p>Sub in $v = \frac{2 \pi r}{T}$ for $v$:</p>

<p>$\frac{GMm}{r} = m(\frac{2 \pi r}{T})^2$</p>

<p>Divide both sides by $m$:</p>

<p>$\frac{GM}{r} = (\frac{2 \pi r}{T})^2$</p>

<p>Root both sides:</p>

<p>$\sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}} = \frac{2 \pi r}{T}$</p>

<p>Flip both sides and divide by $2 \pi r$:</p>

<p>$T = \frac{2 \pi r}{\sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}}$</p>

Which I can simplify:</p>

<p>Multiply both sides by $\sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}$:</p>

<p>$T \times \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}} = 2 \pi r$</p>

<p>Square both sides:</p>

<p>$T^2 \times \frac{GM}{r} = (2 \pi r)^2$</p>

<p>Divide both sides by $\frac{GM}{r}$:</p>

<p>$T^2 = \frac{(2 \pi r)^2}{\frac{GM}{r}}$</p>

<p>Clean it up:</p>

<p>$T^2 = \frac{(2 \pi r)^2 \times r}{GM}$</p>

<p>Take out $r$ to get the final answer:</p>

<p>$T^2 = \frac{(2 \pi)^2}{GM}r^3$</p>

<p>Thus the lines are either parallel or the same line (with different parametrizations).</p>

<p>Parallel lines do not intersect, whereas the same line will share all points. So setting the parametrizations equal to each other and solving equations will allow you to determine whether they intersect or not.</p>

<p>${\bf r}_1(t)={\bf r}_2(s)$ means that $-2+3t=2-6s$, $3+t=3-2s$, $1-3t=4+6s$. The second equation says $t=-2s$.

<p>Let us start with your expression</p>

<p>$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\sin(\omega_0t)\cos(\omega t)}{(\omega_ot)}dt-\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{j\sin(\omega_0t)\sin(\omega t)}{(\omega_ot)}dt$$ </p>

<p>Examining the integrals, the term $\omega_0t$ in the denominator makes evaluating the integral more involved.</p>

<p>We can use some relevant trigonometric identities so that we can express
$$\sin(\omega_0t)\cos(\omega t)=\frac{1}{2}[\sin((\omega+\omega_0)t)-\sin((\omega-\omega_0)t)]$$</p>

<p>$$\sin(\omega_0t)\sin(\omega t)=\frac{1}{2}[\cos((\omega-\omega_0)t)-\cos((\omega+\omega_0)t)]$$</p>

<p>To deal with the awkward $\omega_0t$ term, we can use the following identity to convert the single integral into a double integral that is  far nicer to evaluate:
$$\frac{1}{\omega_0t}=\int_0^{\infty}e^{-\omega_0ts}ds$$</p>

<p>Thus the integral to evaluate is 
$$\int_0^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\sin(\omega_0t)\cos(\omega t)e^{-\omega_0tx}dtdx-j\int_0^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\sin(\omega_0t)\sin(\omega t)e^{-\omega_0tx}dtdx$$  </p>

<p>which expands to
$$\frac{1}{2}\int_0^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\sin((\omega+\omega_0)t)e^{-\omega_0tx}dtdx-\frac{1}{2}\int_0^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\sin((\omega-\omega_0)t)e^{-\omega_0tx}dtdx\\-\frac{j}{2}\int_0^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\cos((\omega-\omega_0)t)e^{-\omega_0tx}dtdx+\frac{j}{2}\int_0^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\cos((\omega+\omega_0)t)e^{-\omega_0tx}dtdx$$</p>

<p>We can exploit Fubini's theorem to rewrite the integral as</p>

<p>$$\frac{1}{2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left[\int_0^{\infty}\sin((\omega+\omega_0)t)e^{-\omega_0xt}dt\right]dx-\frac{1}{2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left[\int_0^{\infty}\sin((\omega-\omega_0)t)e^{-\omega_0xt}dt\right]dx\\-\frac{j}{2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left[\int_0^{\infty}\cos((\omega-\omega_0)t)e^{-\omega_0xt}dt\right]dx+\frac{j}{2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left[\int_0^{\infty}\cos((\omega+\omega_0)t)e^{-\omega_0xt}dt\right]dx$$</p>

<p>We shall use the following integral identities to calculate the above integrals :-
$$\int_0^{\infty}\sin(at)e^{-st}dt=\frac{a}{a^2+s^2}$$
$$\int_0^{\infty}\cos(at)e^{-st}dt=\frac{s}{a^2+s^2}$$</p>

<p>This results in
$$\frac{1}{2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left[\frac{(\omega+\omega_0)}{(\omega+\omega_0)^2+\omega_0^2x^2}\right]dx-\frac{1}{2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left[\frac{(\omega-\omega_0)}{(\omega-\omega_0)^2+\omega_0^2x^2}\right]dx\\-\frac{j}{2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left[\frac{\omega_0x}{(\omega-\omega_0)^2+\omega_0^2x^2}\right]dx+\frac{j}{2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left[\frac{\omega_0x}{(\omega+\omega_0)^2+\omega_0^2x^2}\right]dx\text{  (Eq. 1)}$$</p>

<p>To evaluate the real component integrals in (Eq. $1$), we use the following result:-
$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{a}{a^2+s^s}ds=\frac{|a|}{a}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{1}{1+y^2}dy=sgn(a)\left[\arctan y\right]^{\infty}_{-\infty}=sgn(a)\pi$$</p>

<p>This leads to
$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left[\frac{(\omega+\omega_0)}{(\omega+\omega_0)^2+\omega_0^2x^2}\right]dx=sgn(\omega+\omega_0)\pi$$
$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left[\frac{(\omega-\omega_0)}{(\omega-\omega_0)^2+\omega_0^2x^2}\right]dx=sgn(\omega-\omega_0)\pi$$</p>

<p>As regards the imaginary component integrals, note that the numerator is simply a constant times the derivative of the denominator, so we have</p>

<p>$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left[\frac{\omega_0x}{(\omega-\omega_0)^2+\omega_0^2x^2}\right]dx=\frac{1}{2\omega_0}\left[\ln\{(\omega-\omega_0)^2+\omega_0^2x^2\}\right]_{-\infty}^{\infty}$$ </p>

<p>$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left[\frac{\omega_0x}{(\omega+\omega_0)^2+\omega_0^2x^2}\right]dx=\frac{1}{2\omega_0}\left[\ln\{(\omega+\omega_0)^2+\omega_0^2x^2\}\right]_{-\infty}^{\infty}$$ </p>

<p>Combining the imaginary component integrals as per the integral in (Eq. $1$) we wish to evaluate and noting that they have opposite signs, we have
$$-\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left[\frac{\omega_0x}{(\omega-\omega_0)^2+\omega_0^2x^2}\right]dx+\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left[\frac{\omega_0x}{(\omega+\omega_0)^2+\omega_0^2x^2}\right]dx\\=\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{2\omega_0}ln\left[\frac{(\omega+\omega_0)^2+\omega_0^2x^2}{(\omega-\omega_0)^2+\omega_0^2x^2}\right]+\lim_{x\rightarrow -\infty}\frac{1}{2\omega_0}ln\left[\frac{(\omega-\omega_0)^2+\omega_0^2x^2}{(\omega+\omega_0)^2+\omega_0^2x^2}\right]=\frac{2}{\omega_0}\ln(1)=0$$
Thus the imaginary terms in the integral cancel out, leading to the integral in (Eq. $1$) being a real result, as follows
$$\frac{\pi}{2}\left[sgn(\omega+\omega_0)-sgn(\omega-\omega_0)\right]$$</p>

<p>Putting everything together we have:
$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\sin(\omega_0t)\cos(\omega t)}{(\omega_ot)}dt-\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{j\sin(\omega_0t)\sin(\omega t)}{(\omega_ot)}dt=\frac{\pi}{2}\left[sgn(\omega+\omega_0)-sgn(\omega-\omega_0)\right]$$</p>

<p>The result is a rectangular function that starts from frequency $-\omega_0$ and ends at frequency $\omega_0$.</p>

"How do the floor and ceiling functions work on negative numbers?","33119","","<p>It's clear to me how these functions work on positive real numbers: you round up or down accordingly. But if you have to round a negative real number: to take $\,-0.8\,$ to $\,-1,\,$ then do you take the floor of $\,-0.8,\,$ or the ceiling?</p>

<p>That is, which of the following are true?</p>

<p>$$\lfloor-0.8\rfloor=-1$$</p>

<p>$$\text{or}$$
$$\lceil-0.8\rceil=-1$$</p>
","<p>The first is the correct: you round ""down"" (i.e. the greatest integer LESS THAN $-0.8$). </p>

<p>In contrast, the ceiling function rounds ""up"" to the least integer GREATER THAN $-0.8 = 0$.</p>

<p>$$
\begin{align} \lfloor{-0.8}\rfloor &amp; = -1\quad &amp; \text{since}\;\; \color{blue}{\bf -1} \lt -0.8 \lt 0 \\ \\
\lceil {-0.8} \rceil &amp; = 0\quad &amp;\text{since} \;\; -1 \lt -0.8 \lt \color{blue}{\bf 0}
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>In general, we must have that $$\lfloor x \rfloor \leq x\leq \lceil x \rceil\quad \forall x \in \mathbb R$$</p>

<p>And so it follows that $$-1 = \lfloor -0.8 \rfloor \leq -0.8 \leq \lceil -0.8 \rceil = 0$$</p>

<hr>

<p>K.Stm's suggestion is a nice, intuitive way to recall the relation between the floor and the ceiling of a real number $x$, especially when $x\lt 0$. Using the ""number line"" idea and plotting $-0.8$ with the two closest integers that ""sandwich"" $-0.8$ gives us: </p>

<p>$\qquad\qquad$<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5tHO7.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>We see that the <em>floor</em> of $x= -0.8$ is the first integer immediately to the <em>left</em> of $-0.8,\;$ and the <em>ceiling</em> of $x= -0.8$ is the first integer immediately to the <em>right</em> of $-0.8$, and this strategy can be used, whatever the value of a real number $x$.</p>

<p>Is the formula not a general one? What are the scenarios where we can use and where we can't use it? </p>

<p>Is there a general formula for such questions?</p>
","<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/14nw4.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Let us denote the radius of circle with center $A$ as $r_{1}$ and circle with center $C$ as $r_{2}$, and $AC=d$ as the distance between the centers. </p>

<p>Now note by SAS criteria (prove $\triangle ADC$ and $\triangle ABC$ are congruent by SSS and ...) that $\triangle ABE$ and $\triangle ADE$ are congruent. Thus $\angle AEB = \angle AED$, but since $\angle AEB + \angle AED = 180^{\circ}$, we have  $\angle AEB = \angle AED = 90^{\circ}$. Similarly, $\angle BEC = \angle DEC= 90^{\circ}$. </p>

<p>Thus, we can see that $BE$ is the height of $\triangle ABC$, and $DE$ is the height of $\triangle ADC$, with base $AC$. So, </p>

<p>$$BD=BE+DE=\frac{2(ABC)}{AC} + \frac{2(ADC)}{AC}=\frac{4}{d}(ABC)$$</p>

<p>Where $(ABC)$ and $(ADC)$ represents the area of the respective triangles, which we can calculate in terms of $r_{1},r_{2},d$ using the Herons formula. This is the general formula which gives the length of the common chord, $BD$. I leave the proof of the above formula above as a exercise for you. </p>

<p>However, your formula was for a special case, when $\angle ABC = \angle ADC= 90^{\circ}$. This simplifies the area of the triangles and gives:</p>

<p>$$BC=\frac{4}{d}(ABC)=\frac{2r_{1}r_{2}}{d}$$</p>

<p>Since, in your first question, the pair $(r_{1},r_{2},d)$ was $(15,20,25)$, which is a Pythagorean triple, so the condition $\angle ABC = \angle ADC= 90^{\circ}$ held, and so did your formula. Now lets come to the second question, with a new diagram:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/J7kPA.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I leave it as a exercise to you to prove that $r_{1}=r_{2}=AB=AC=BC$. Hence, $ABC$ is an equilateral triangle with $\angle ABC = 60^{\circ} \neq 90^{\circ}$. Hence your formula does not hold, and we must return to the general formula:</p>

<p>$$AD=\frac{4}{d}(ABC)=\frac{4}{d}\frac{\sqrt{3}(AC)^2}{4}=\frac{\sqrt{3}(r_{1})^2}{r_{1}}=\sqrt{3}r_{1}$$ </p>

<p>What I essentially did in the second last step, was to use the Pythagoras theorem, like the way you must have did, to find the altitude in terms of the side, $r_{1}$, and use it to find the area of the triangle, or we can directly find $AD$ from the height.</p>

"Prove that the union of countably many countable sets is countable.","33086","","<p>I am doing some homework exercises and stumbled upon this question. I don't know where to start. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Prove that the union of countably many countable sets is countable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just reading it confuses me. </p>

<p>Any hints or help is greatly appreciated! Cheers!</p>
","<p>Let's start with a quick review of ""countable"". A set is countable if we can set up a 1-1 correspondence between the set and the natural numbers. As an example, let's take $Z$, which consists of all the integers. Is $\mathbb Z$ countable?</p>

<p>It may seem uncountable if you pick a naive correspondence, say $1 \mapsto 1$, $2 \mapsto 2 ...$, which leaves all of the negative numbers unmapped. But if we organize the integers like this:</p>

<p>$$0$$
$$1, -1$$
$$2, -2$$
$$3, -3$$
$$...$$</p>

<p>We quickly see that there is a map that works. Map 1 to 0, 2 to 1, 3 to -1, 4 to 2, 5 to -2, etc. So given an element $x$ in $\mathbb Z$, we either have that $1 \mapsto x$ if $x=0$, $2x \mapsto x$ if $x &gt; 0$, or $2|x|+1 \mapsto x$ if $x &lt; 0$. So the integers are countable.</p>

<p>We proved this by finding a map between the integers and the natural numbers. So to show that the union of countably many sets is countable, we need to find a similar mapping. First, let's unpack ""the union of countably many countable sets is countable"":</p>

<ol>
<li><p>""countable sets"" pretty simple. If $S$ is in our set of sets, there's a 1-1 correspondence between elements of $S$ and $\mathbb N$.</p></li>
<li><p>""countably many countable sets"" we have a 1-1 correspondence between $\mathbb N$ and the sets themselves. In other words, we can write the sets as $S_1$, $S_2$, $S_3$... Let's call the set of sets $\{S_n\}, n \in \mathbb N$.</p></li>
<li><p>""union of countably many countable sets is countable"". There is a 1-1 mapping between the elements in $\mathbb N$ and the elements in $S_1 \cup S_2 \cup S_3 ...$</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So how do we prove this? We need to find a correspondence, of course. Fortunately, there's a simple way to do this. Let $s_{nm}$ be the $mth$ element of $S_n$. We can do this because $S_n$ is by definition of the problem countable. We can write the elements of ALL the sets like this:</p>

<p>$$s_{11}, s_{12}, s_{13} ...$$
$$s_{21}, s_{22}, s_{23} ...$$
$$s_{31}, s_{32}, s_{33} ...$$
$$...$$</p>

<p>Now let $1 \mapsto s_{11}$, $2 \mapsto s_{12}$, $3 \mapsto s_{21}$, $4 \mapsto s_{13}$, etc. You might notice that if we cross out every element that we've mapped, we're crossing them out in diagonal lines. With $1$ we cross out the first diagonal, $2-3$ we cross out the second diagonal, $4-6$ the third diagonal, $7-10$ the fourth diagonal, etc. The $nth$ diagonal requires us to map $n$ elements to cross it out. Since we never ""run out"" of elements in $\mathbb N$, eventually given any diagonal we'll create a map to every element in it. Since obviously every element in $S_1 \cup S_2 \cup S_3 ...$ is in one of the diagonals, we've created a 1-1 map between $\mathbb N$ and the set of sets.</p>

<p>Let's extend this one step further. What if we made $s_{11} = 1/1$, $s_{12} = 1/2$, $s_{21} = 2/1$, etc? Then $S_1 \cup S_2 \cup S_3 ... = \mathbb Q^+$! This is called the ""diagonalization argument"", and is how you prove that the rationals are countable. Well, the positive rationals anyway. Can you extend these proofs to show that the rationals are countable?</p>

Could you give a definition and an intuitive explanation?</p>
","<p>There are many ways you can characterize the smoothness of a curve.</p>

<p>Typically, people use the notation $C^{(n)}(\Omega)$ where $n \in \mathbb{N}$.</p>

<p>So when we say $f(x) \in C^{(n)}(\Omega)$, we mean that $f(x)$ has $n$ derivatives in the entire domain ($\Omega$ denotes the domain of the function) and the $n^{th}$ derivative of $f(x)$ is continuous i.e. $f^{n}(x)$ is continuous.</p>

<p>Also by convention, if $f(x)$ is just continuous, then we say $f(x) \in C^{(0)}(\Omega)$.</p>

<p>Also, $f(x) \in C^{(\infty)}$ if the function is differentiable any number of times. For instance, $e^{x} \in C^{(\infty)}$</p>

<p>An example to illustrate is to consider the following function $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$.
$$f(x) = \begin{cases}0, &amp;\mbox{if }x \leq 0 \\ x^2, &amp;\mbox{if }x&gt;0\end{cases}$$</p>

<p>This function is in $C^{(1)}(\mathbb{R})$ but not in $C^{(2)}(\mathbb{R})$.</p>

<p>When the domain of the function is the largest set over which the function definition makes sense, we omit $\Omega$ and write that $f \in C^{(n)}$, the domain being understood as the largest set over which the function definition makes sense.</p>

<p>Note that $C^{(n)} \subseteq C^{(m)}$ whenever $n&gt;m$.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>In case of Green's theorem, when we apply the formula
$$\oint_c (L\,dx + M\,dy) = \iint_D \left(\frac{\partial M}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial y}\right)\,dx\,dy$$
we need $L,M \in C^1{(\Omega)}$, where $\Omega$ is a domain containing the curve and the interior of the curve viz $D$.</p>

<p>The simple closed curve $C$ should be piecewise smooth or more generally the curve $C$ should be in $C^{(0)}$.</p>

<p>We say that the curve $C$ is piecewise smooth curve when the two conditions below are satisfied:</p>

<p>(i) $C \in C^{(0)}$</p>

<p>(ii) The domain over which the curve is defined can be partitioned into disjoint subsets such that the curve is in $C^{(\infty)}$ (or sufficiently smooth i.e. the curve is in $C^{(n)}$ for some $n$ till which we are interested) over each of these subsets.</p>

<p>For eigenvalue 1, the eigenspace I got was $span[ 1,0,0]$, and for eigenvalue 4, the eigenspace I got was $span[ 1,-3,9]$. Do they look right?</p>

<p>The reason the matrix is not diagonalizable is because we only have 2 linearly independent eigevectors so we can't span R3 with them, hence we can't create a matrix E with the eigenvectors as its basis. Is that correct, did I word it right?</p>
","<p>The algebraic multiplicity of $\lambda=1$ is $2$. A matrix is diagonalizable if and only if the algebraic multiplicity equals the geometric multiplicity of each eigenvalues.</p>

<p>By your computations, the eigenspace of $\lambda=1$ has dimension $1$; that is, the geometric multiplicity of $\lambda=1$ is $1$, and so strictly smaller than its algebraic multiplicity. Therefore, $A$ is not diagonalizable.</p>

<p>Note that you don't actually need to compute the eigenspace to determine diagonalizability: you just need to figure out the dimension of the eigenspace. The eigenspace of $\lambda=1$ is the nullspace of $A-I$. Since
$$A-I = \left(\begin{array}{ccc}
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 3
\end{array}\right)$$
has rank $2$, it has nullity $1$, so the dimension of the eigenspace corresponding to $\lambda=1$ is $1$, strictly smaller than the algebraic multiplicity. This suffices to show $A$ is not diagonalizable.</p>

using the formula 
$(x-q)^2 + (y-p)^2 = r^2$.</p>

<p>I know i need to use that formula but have no idea how to start, I have tried to start but don't think my answer is right.</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>I know i need to use that formula but have no idea how to start</p>
</blockquote>

<p>\begin{equation*}
\left( x-q\right) ^{2}+\left( y-p\right) ^{2}=r^{2}\tag{0}
\end{equation*}</p>

<p>A possible very elementary way is to use this formula thrice, one for each point. Since the circle passes through the point $(5,10)$, it satisfies $(0)$, i.e.</p>

<p>$$\left( 5-q\right) ^{2}+\left( 10-p\right) ^{2}=r^{2}\tag{1}$$</p>

<p>Similarly for the second point $(-5,0)$:</p>

<p>$$\left( -5-q\right) ^{2}+\left( 0-p\right) ^{2}=r^{2},\tag{2}$$</p>

<p>and for $(9,-6)$:</p>

<p>$$\left( 9-q\right) ^{2}+\left( -6-p\right) ^{2}=r^{2}.\tag{3}$$</p>

<p>We thus have the following system of three simultaneous equations and in the three unknowns $p,q,r$:</p>

<p>$$\begin{cases}
\left( 5-q\right) ^{2}+\left( 10-p\right) ^{2}=r^{2} \\ 
\left( -5-q\right) ^{2}+p^{2}=r^{2} \\ 
\left( 9-q\right) ^{2}+\left( 6+p\right) ^{2}=r^{2}
\end{cases}\tag{4}
$$</p>

<p>To solve it, we can start by subtracting the second equation from the first  </p>

<p>$$\begin{cases}
\left( 5-q\right) ^{2}+\left( 10-p\right) ^{2}-\left( 5+q\right) ^{2}-p^{2}=0 \\ 
\left( 5+q\right) ^{2}+p^{2}=r^{2} \\ 
\left( 9-q\right) ^{2}+\left( 6+p\right) ^{2}=r^{2}
\end{cases}
$$</p>

<p>Expanding now the left hand side of the first equation we get a <em>linear</em> equation</p>

<p>$$\begin{cases}
100-20q-20p=0 \\ 
\left( 5+q\right) ^{2}+p^{2}=r^{2} \\ 
\left( 9-q\right) ^{2}+\left( 6+p\right) ^{2}=r^{2}
\end{cases}
$$</p>

<p>Solving the first equation for $q$ and substituting in the other equations, we get</p>

<p>$$\begin{cases}
q=5-p \\ 
\left( 10-p\right) ^{2}+p^{2}-\left( 4+p\right) ^{2}-\left( 6+p\right) ^{2}=0 \\ 
\left( 4+p\right) ^{2}+\left( 6+p\right) ^{2}=r^{2}
\end{cases}
$$</p>

<p>If we simplify the second equation, it becomes a <em>linear</em> equation in $p$ only</p>

<p>$$\begin{cases}
q=5-p \\ 
48-40p=0 \\ 
\left( 4+p\right) ^{2}+\left( 6+p\right) ^{2}=r^{2}
\end{cases}
$$</p>

<p>We have reduced our quadratic system $(4)$ to two linear equations plus the equation for $r^2$. From the second equation we find $p=6/5$, which we substitute in the first and in the third equations to find $q=19/5$ and $r^2=1972/25$, i.e</p>

<p>$$\begin{cases}
q=5-\frac{6}{5}=\frac{19}{5} \\ 
p=\frac{6}{5} \\ 
r^{2}=\left( 4+\frac{6}{5}\right) ^{2}+\left( 6+\frac{6}{5}\right) ^{2}=
\frac{1972}{25}.
\end{cases}\tag{5}
$$</p>

<p>So the equation of the circle is</p>

<p>\begin{equation*}
\left( x-\frac{19}{5}\right) ^{2}+\left( y-\frac{6}{5}\right) ^{2}=\frac{1972}{25}.

","<h1>Computing a projective transformation</h1>

<p>A <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_transformation#Mathematical_definition"">projective transformation</a> of the (projective) plane is uniquely defined by four projected points, unless three of them are collinear. Here is how you can obtain the $3\times 3$ transformation matrix of the projective transformation.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Starting with the 4 positions in the source image, named $(x_1,y_1)$ through $(x_4,y_4)$, you solve the following <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_linear_equations"">system of linear equations</a>:</p>

<p>$$\begin{pmatrix}
x_1 &amp; x_2 &amp; x_3 \\
y_1 &amp; y_2 &amp; y_3 \\
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}\cdot
\begin{pmatrix}\lambda\\\mu\\\tau\end{pmatrix}=
\begin{pmatrix}x_4\\y_4\\1\end{pmatrix}$$</p>

<p>The colums form <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates"">homogenous coordinates</a>: one dimension more, created by adding a $1$ as the last entry. In subsequent steps, multiples of these vectors will be used to denote the same points. See the last step for an example of how to turn these back into two-dimensional coordinates.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Scale the columns by the coefficients you just computed:</p>

<p>$$A=\left(\begin{array}{lll}
\lambda\cdot x_1 &amp; \mu\cdot x_2 &amp; \tau\cdot x_3 \\
\lambda\cdot y_1 &amp; \mu\cdot y_2 &amp; \tau\cdot y_3 \\
\lambda &amp; \mu &amp; \tau
\end{array}\right)$$</p>

<p>This matrix will map $(1,0,0)$ to a multiple of $(x_1,y_1,1)$, $(0,1,0)$ to a multiple of $(x_2,y_2,1)$, $(0,0,1)$ to a multiple of $(x_3,y_3,1)$ and $(1,1,1)$ to $(x_4,y_4,1)$. So it will map these four special vectors (called <em>basis vectors</em> in subsequent explanations) to the specified positions in the image.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Repeat steps 1 and 2 for the corresponding positions in the destination image, in order to obtain a second matrix called $B$.</p>

<p>This is a map from basis vectors to destination positions.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_matrix"">Invert</a> $A$ to obtain $A^{-1}$ (or use the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjugate_matrix"">adjugate</a> as discussed below).</p>

<p>$A$ maps from basis vectors to the source positions, so the inverse matrix maps in the reverse direction.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Compute the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication"">combined</a> Matrix $C = B\cdot A^{-1}$.</p>

<p>$A^{-1}$ maps from source positions to basis vectors, while $B$ maps from there to destination positions. So the combination maps source positions to destination positions. This is the matrix of the transformation you were requesting.</p>

<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> To map a location $(x,y)$ from the source image to its corresponding location in the destination image, compute the product</p>

<p>$$\begin{pmatrix}x'\\y'\\z'\end{pmatrix} =
C\cdot\begin{pmatrix}x\\y\\1\end{pmatrix}$$</p>

<p>These are the homogenous coordinates of your transformed point.</p>

<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Compute the position in the destination image like this:</p>

<p>\begin{align*}
x'' &amp;= \frac{x'}{z'} \\
y'' &amp;= \frac{y'}{z'}
\end{align*}</p>

<p>This is called <em>dehomogenization</em> of the coordinate vector.</p>

<h1>How to use this projective transformation with CSS</h1>

<p>In general such a transformation will <em>not</em> be an affine transformation, so you cannot express this in terms of affine transformations like scaling, rotating and shearing, since these cannot express perspectivity. You might however try to simply set the first two entries of the last row to zero, so you get an affine transformation which might be close enough to your desired transformation.</p>

<p>If on the other hand you <a href=""http://caniuse.com/#feat=transforms3d"">can use</a> a <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-css3-transforms-20120911/#matrix3d-function""><code>matrix3d</code></a> transformation, then you can take the 2D projective transformation matrix $C$ computed as described above, and use its entries to build a 3D projective transformation matrix like this:</p>

<p>$$\begin{pmatrix}
C_{1,1} &amp; C_{1,2} &amp; 0 &amp; C_{1,3} \\
C_{2,1} &amp; C_{2,2} &amp; 0 &amp; C_{2,3} \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
C_{3,1} &amp; C_{3,2} &amp; 0 &amp; C_{3,3}
\end{pmatrix}$$</p>

<p>This transformation will transform $x$ and $y$ coordinate as above, but leave the $z$ coordinates of the homogenous coordinate vectors alone. Dehomogenization might still change the value of the $z$ coordinate in space, but as you don't really care about these, this should be good enough.</p>

<p>I've written <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/dFrHS/1/"">a proof-of-concept implementation</a>. The user interface is pretty crude, but the math works well enough. The implementation there uses the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjugate_matrix"">adjugate matrix</a> instead of the inverse, both in solving the linear equations in step 1 and for the reverse transform in step 4. The result differs only by a scalar factor, which is irrelevant for homogenous coordinates. The benefit is that this avoids computing a bunch of determinants and performing a bunch of divisions.</p>

<p>If you wanted to, you could play the same game for five points in 3D space, in order to compute the full spatial projective transformation matrix. But that only makes sense if you actually have depth, sice no four of the five points may be coplanar.</p>

"Can the inverse of a function be the same as the original function?","32927","","<p>I was wondering if the inverse of a function can be the same function.</p>

<p>For example when I try to invert</p>

<p>$g(x) = 2 - x$</p>

<p>The inverse seems to be the same function. Am I doing something wrong here?</p>
","<p>You're correct. A function that's its own inverse is called an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involution_%28mathematics%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">involution</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit: Oh let's have some fun. :) What are some other functions that are easy to check are involutions? I've cherry picked some of my favorites in what follows, both from memory and also the references I provide below.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>First, note that there's an easy test to determine whether or not $f$ is an involution. Namely, since $f^{-1} = f$, you just need to double check that $f(f(x)) = x$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$. This can be used to verify all three of the following examples are actually involutions.</p></li>
<li><p>Your function $g(x)$ generalizes to a whole class of involutions! Namely,
$$
    f(x) = a-x
$$
is an involution for any real number $a$. In particular, $f(x) = 0 - x = -x$ is an involution (as is $f(x) = x$, of course).</p></li>
<li><p>As someone already pointed out, $f(x) = 1/x$ (defined for all real $x \neq 0$) is also an involution. More generally, for any real $a$ and $b$ the function
$$
    f(x) = a + \frac{b}{x-a} = \frac{ax + (b-a^2)}{x-a}
$$
satisfies
$$
    f(f(x)) = a + \frac{b}{a + \frac{b}{x-a} - a} = a + (x-a) = x
$$
for all real $x \neq a$, and as such is also an involution on this domain.</p></li>
<li><p>Here's a less obvious (but cool) example. Consider the function $f(x) = (a - x^3)^{1/3}$. You can check this directly that $f(f(x)) = (a - ((a-x^3)^{1/3})^3)^{1/3} = x$. This is an example of a large class of involutions generated by a special type of symmetric function $F(x,y)$ (as explained <a href=""http://eqworld.ipmnet.ru/en/education/wiener.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Fun Fact: The <strong>only</strong> continuous, odd ($f(-x) = -f(x)$ for all $x$) involutions with domain $(-\infty,\infty)$ are $f(x) = \pm x$. (A short proof of this fact is given <a href=""http://eqworld.ipmnet.ru/en/education/wiener.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>There are <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/46635/examples-of-involutions-on-mathbbr"">many</a>, <a href=""http://eqworld.ipmnet.ru/en/education/wiener.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">many</a>, more of these functions, and they occur naturally/are useful tools in many branches of mathematics.</p></li>

"How to calculate combinations of multiple variables which can assume multiple values","32919","","<p>I have 3 variables (A,B,C); each variable can assume 3 different values (1,2,3) .
I want to calculate ho many combinations there are which follow this rule:</p>

<p>let's fix <strong>A1</strong>, then cycle on all the others variables which can assume 3 values each; then let's move on to <strong>A2</strong> and calculate again all the combinations by cycling over the 2 remaining variables (which can assume 3 values each); same thing for <strong>A3</strong>. Once I am done with A I repeat the same process with B and so on. The constrain is that the combinations must repeat only once over all:
in fact if I fix <strong>A1</strong> and the combination I get is (<strong>A1</strong> B3 C2 ), then when I fix for example <strong>B3</strong> I must not count (A1 <strong>B</strong>3 C2) because it has been already found before.</p>

<p>So what I need is the mathematical formula that allows me to do this calculation with a generic number of variables which can assume a generic number of values</p>
","<p>For clarification, I am assuming we are keeping it as an <em>ordered pair</em> (A,B,C) for whatever ABC happens to be.  (I.e. we are never concerned about a permutation of the letters such as (B,A,C))</p>

<p>You have 3 choices for the result of A, three choices for the result of B, and 3 choices for the result of C.  By multiplication principle it is then $3\cdot 3\cdot 3 = 3^3=27$.</p>

<p>In general, if you have $r$ variables, each of which can take $n$ values, (I.e. we have letters $(A_1, A_2,\dots, A_r)$ each of which can be any number from $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$, there will be $n\cdot n\cdots n = n^r$ total possibilities.</p>

<p>Even more generally, if you have $r$ variables, the $i^{th}$ of which can take on $n_i$ values, you will have $\prod\limits_{i=1}^r n_i$ number of possibilities.</p>

<p>For a simple example, you go to an icecream shop and would like to get a sundae.  A sundae consists of one flavor of icecream and any combination of toppings you'd like (some, all, or none).  If there are five flavors of icecream and four available toppings, how many <em>different</em> ice cream sundaes are possible?  Break it up via multiplication principle to first ask the question how many flavors of icecream there are (flavor 1, flavor 2,...).  Then to ask the question if you use the first topping (yes or no), yes or no to the second topping, yes or no to the third...</p>

<p>This is exactly the same problem as how many possibilities exist for (A,B,C,D,E) if $A\in\{1,2,3,4,5\}$, and each of B through E are either 1 or 2.  If for example, B is 1, then don't use that topping.</p>

<p>There are then $5\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2=80$ possible sundaes.</p>

"Pure vs mixed strategy Nash Equilibria","32880","","<p>Just learning about Nash Equilibria. The pure strategy one is explained as an outcome where both/all players feel like they couldn't have done better given what the others were doing. Mixed strategy is one where even after announcing your strategy openly, your opponents can make any choice without affecting their expected gains. Is there a relationship between the two ? Is the pure strategy one some sort of special case for the mixed strategy one ? (I doubt it, since there can be multiple pure ones, while the linear equations of the mixed one can only give one or infinite number of results). I'd like to intuitively understand the relationship. Thanks !</p>
","<p>If you like, you can think of a pure strategy as a mixed strategy in which a player has a 100% chance of picking a certain strategy.</p>

<p>The equilibrium definition is the same for both pure and mixed strategy equilibria (""even after announcing your strategy openly, your opponents can make any choice without affecting their expected gains"").  The difference is that in a mixed equilibrium, you are announcing your <em>probability distribution</em>, not the strategy that it randomly produces.</p>

<p>Example: Rock-Paper-Scissors.  There are no pure strategy equilibria: If I announce ""I'm going to play definitely Rock!"" then clearly my opponent will choose Paper; if I know they're going to play paper then I don't want to play Rock anymore, so this is not stable.  However, if I announce ""I'm going to secretly roll a die, play Rock if it shows 1-2, Scissors for 3-4, and Paper for 5-6!"" then my opponent is equally happy with any choice he makes.  If he therefore chooses the same strategy as me, then <em>I</em> am equally happy with any choice I make, so this is a mixed equilibrium.</p>

<p>Also, your statement ""the linear equations of the mixed one can only give one or infinite number of results"" isn't true - there are many games with an in-between number of equilibria (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_%28game%29"">Chicken</a>, for example, has 3 in a two-player version of the game).  As an aside, a randomly-generated game will have a finite, odd number of equilibria with probability 1, but that's about all you can say about the number of equilibria.</p>

<p>Then, they take its discriminant and say it is less than 0.</p>

<p>$36 - (4 * 32) &lt; 0 $</p>

<p>And ,then they say it is true. I didn't understand how taking the discriminant of the discriminant helped prove.</p>
","<p>The first quadratic is in $x$ where you want the solutions to be real. Therefore the discriminant must be non-negative. Furthermore you want distinct real roots, therefore the discriminant must be positive.</p>

<p>When you compute the discriminant for the quadratic equation in $x$, you end up getting a quadratic expression in $k$. Then for it to be positive, you ended up with a quadratic inequality
$$(5-k)^2-4(k+2)&gt;0$$
This is equivalent to 
$$k^2-14k+17 &gt;0$$</p>

<p>Think of this as a parabola in $k$ and you want this parabola to be always above the $k-$axis. That means NO real solutions. For this the discriminant of this quadratic expression in $k$ must be negative.</p>

<p>PS: However please note that the last inequality is not true for all values of $k$. In fact
it is only true when 
$$k \in (-\infty, 7-4\sqrt{2}) \cup (7+4\sqrt{2}, \infty).$$
So for these values of $k$ the quadratic equation will have real roots.</p>

To simplify the logarithm:
$$
\lim_{h\to0}\left (1 + \frac{h}{x}\right )^{\frac{1}{h}} = e^{\frac{1}{x}}
$$
^This is the line I have trouble with. I can see that it is true by putting numbers in, but I can't prove it. I know that $e^{\frac{1}{x}} = \lim_{h\to0}\left (1 + h \right )^{\frac{1}{xh}}$, but I can't work out how to get from the above line to that.
$$
\lim_{h\to0}\left ( \left (1 + \frac{h}{x}\right )^{\frac{1}{h}}\right )^{h} = e^{\frac{h}{x}}

Going back to the derivative:
$$
\begin{align}

&amp;= \lim_{h\to0} \frac{\frac{h}{x}\ln(e)}{h} \\
&amp;= \lim_{h\to0} \frac{h}{x} \div h\\

<p>This proof seems fine, apart from the middle step to get $e^{\frac{1}{x}}$. How could I prove that part?</p>
","<p>Define $$e=\lim_{h\to 0} \left(1+h\right)^{1/h}.$$ Then change variables $h\mapsto h/x$ giving $$e=\lim_{h/x\to 0} \left(1+\frac{h}{x}\right)^{\frac{x}{h}}=\lim_{h\to 0} \left(1+\frac{h}{x}\right)^{\frac{x}{h}},$$ where the limit in the second equality follows since $h$ approaches $0$ as $h/x$ does. Since $x$ is constant w.r.t. $h$, we can simplify by raising both sides to the power $1/x$, giving you the desired identity.</p>

<p>Start by sketching the graphs of $y=8$, $y=x^3$, and $x=0$.
We then see that  the region to be revolved about the $x$-axis is in the first quadrant. It is bounded above by the line $y=8$,  on the left by the $y$-axis, and on the right by the graph of $y=x^3$.  Note that the point of intersection in the upper right is  $(2,8)$ and can be found by solving the equation $8=x^3$.</p>

<p>The region is shown, shaded  in blue, below:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DtIQc.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Now, you generate the solid by revolving this region about the $x$-axis. The cylindrical shells are generated by revolving a horizontal line segment, shown in green in the diagram, at a fixed $\color{maroon}y$-value  about the $x$-axis.</p>

<p>These line segments ""start"" at $y=0$ and ""end"" at $y=8$. Thus the integral giving the volume of the solid of revolution is with respect to $y$ and is of the form $$\int_{y=0}^{y=8} 2\pi \,\color{maroon}{ r_y} \cdot\color{darkgreen}{ h_y} \, dy$$
where $\color{maroon}{r_y}$ is the radius of the shell at $\color{maroon}y$  and $\color{darkgreen}{h_y}$ is the height of the shell at $\color{maroon}y$.</p>

<p>The height of the shell at $\color{maroon}y$ is the length of the line segment at $\color{maroon}y$.
Since the length of the line segment at $\color{maroon}y$ is the $x$-coordinate of its right hand endpoint, we have</p>

<p>$\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \color{darkgreen}{h_y}=\color{darkgreen}{y^{1/3}}$.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that we want to write $\color{darkgreen}{h_y}$ in terms of $y$, since the integral is with respect to $y$.</p>

<p>The radius of the shell is
the height  above the $x$-axis of  the line segment:</p>

<p>$\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \color{maroon}{r_y}=\color{maroon}y$.</p>

<p>Thus, the volume of the solid of revolution is:

<p>Sloane elaborates on this last suggestion. He mentions the method of differences, where you replace the sequence $a_0,a_1,\dots$ with $a_1-a_0,a_2-a_1,\dots$ and, if necessary, repeat the differencing, until you get something with an obvious pattern. Of course, then you have to know what to do with a recurrence once you have one, but that's another story. </p>

<p>Sloane also says that if a sequence is close to a known sequence, you can try subtracting off the known sequence, and then dealing with the residual by one of the above methods. </p>

<p>If the ratios $a_{n+1}/a_n$ seem to be close to a recognizable sequence $r_n$, then look at the sequence given by $a_{n+1}-r_na_n$. </p>

<p>Factoring the numbers in a sequence, or in a sequence close to the given sequence, will often give a clue as to what is going on. </p>

"""Tricks"" for solving the determinant of a matrix","32394","","<p>I've got an exam coming up, and I'm worried that (as I usually tend to do) I will mess up with some minor algebraic calculation in a large problem like finding the determinant of a 4x4 or larger matrix. I'm likely to be asked to use Laplace Expansion, and I'd like to know if there are any other quick and dirty ways I can try to make sure my answer was correct. Considering I'm not alowed to use a calculator, is there some other non-standard method I can use to try to verify a correct solution?</p>

<p>I know how to find the determinant no problem, but I'm very prone to minor mistakes and I don't want to have to spend too much time reading over every problem in fine detail to make sure I didn't omit a negative sign somewhere.</p>
","<p>If you have time, you could always do the calculation twice, once with the top row as a starting point and one (say) with the bottom row. For example:
$$\begin{vmatrix} a &amp; b &amp; c\\d &amp; e &amp; f\\g &amp; h &amp; i \end{vmatrix}=$$
$$a(ei - fh) -b(di -fg) + c(dh - eg)$$

$$g(bf - ce) - h(af -cd) +i(ae -bd)$$</p>

<p>Of course these give the same result, just with a different order of calculations. If you calculate both by hand and get different results, you know you have an error.</p>

<p>The method suggested bit Git Gud in the comments can also be used, i.e. add scalar multiples of the different rows to each other to get a triangular matrix.

","<p>Let us take $n = 2^m$. Then we have the recurrence $$T(2^m) = 2T(2^{m-1}) + 2^m \log_2(2^m) = 2T(2^{m-1}) + m 2^m$$
Calling $T(2^m)$ as $f(m)$, we get that

&amp; = 2(2f(m-2) + (m-1)2^{m-1}) + m2^m\\

Notice that probability is a subcategory of a subcategory in this category.  So, I think you are not quite right on how much probability is on the exam.

"Proof that $n^3+2n$ is divisible by $3$","32133","","<p>I'm trying to freshen up for school in another month, and I'm struggling with the simplest of proofs!</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>Problem:</h2>
  
  <p>For any natural number $n , n^3 + 2n$ is divisible by $3.$
  <strong><em>This makes sense</em></strong></p>
  
  <h2>Proof:</h2>
  
  <p><strong>Basis Step:</strong> If $n = 0,$ then $n^3 + 2n = 0^3 +$
  $2 \times 0 = 0.$ So it is divisible by $3.$</p>
  
  <p><strong>Induction:</strong> Assume that for an arbitrary natural number $n$,
  $n^3+ 2n$ is divisible by $3.$ </p>
  
  <p><strong>Induction Hypothesis:</strong> To prove this for $n+1,$ first try to express $( n + 1 )^3 + 2( n + 1 )$ in terms of $n^3 + 2n$ and use
  the induction hypothesis. <strong><em>Got it</em></strong></p>

the 3}\}$$</p>
  
  <p>which is divisible by $3$, because $(n^3 + 2n )$ is divisible by $3$
  by the induction hypothesis. <strong><em>What?</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can someone explain that last part? I don't see how you can claim $(n^3+ 2n ) + 3( n^2 + n + 1 )$ is divisible by $3.$</p>
","<p>In the inductive hypothesis, you assumed that $n^3 + 2n$ was divisible by 3 for some $n$, and now you're proving the same for $n+1$. It's like knocking down dominoes: if you can prove that the first domino falls over (base case) and each domino knocks over the next (inductive step), then that means that all of the dominoes get knocked down eventually.</p>

<p>You know that $(n^3 + 2n) + 3(n^2 + n + 1)$ is divisible by 3 because $n^3 + 2n$ is (because of the inductive hypothesis) and $3(n^2 + n + 1)$ is (because it's 3 times an integer). So, their sum is as well.</p>

"What is the greatest integer function, and how do you integrate it?","32034","","<p>$[x]$ denotes the greatest integer $\leq x$. Let $f(x)=[x]$ and let $g(x)=[2x].$  </p>

<p>I am having hard time understanding this. What is meant by ""greatest integer?"" Can anyone refer me to any visual/graphical explanation for $[x]?$ </p>

<p>For example, what would be the evaluation of the integral of $\int_1^3{[x]dx}$ and integral of $\int_0^9[\sqrt t]dt$? </p>

<p>In general, I am completely confused by $[x]$ and its meaning and its functional ability. So any intuitive explanation would be much appreciated. </p>
","<p>Given a real number $x$, the notation $[x]$ (also often seen as $\lfloor x\rfloor$) literally means ""the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$"". For example, $1.2$ is not an integer. The integers are
$$\ldots,\;-4,\;-3,\;-2,\;-1,\;0,\;1,\;2,\;3,\;4,\ldots$$
We throw away all the integers that are <strong>not</strong> less than or equal to $1.2$:
$$\ldots,\;-4,\;-3,\;-2,\;-1,\;0,\;1\hphantom{,\;2,\;3,\;4,\ldots}$$
and take the largest one of them, which is $1$. Therefore, the greatest integer less than $1.2$ is $1$, and we write
$$\lfloor 1.2\rfloor =1.$$

"A plan to defeat a betting game where the odds of winning are 50/50. Help me understand why it's flawed.","32021","","<p>My friend has this plan where he implies that it's impossible to lose, as long as the odds of winning are 50/50 on each bet. His idea is that basically you keep doubling your bet until you win and then start over again.</p>

<p>So for example, you bet 1 dollar and you lose, your net profit is now -1 dollar. Now you double your bet to 2 dollars and you lose again so your net profit is -3 dollars. Now you double your bet to 4 dollars and you win. This means you gain 4 dollars and now your net profit is 1 dollar. So you've made a profit. Now you start again. The reasoning here being that it is highly unlikely for you to lose a 50/50 toss x number of times in a row.</p>

<p>My counter-argument here is that basically if you go in with 50 dollars with the aim of doubling up to 100 dollars, you have the same odds of winning if you do one bet of 50 dollars or the technique outlined above. I cannot wrap my head around explaining this issue in a clear manner though, so maybe you wonderful folk at Mathematics can help!</p>

<p>Oh and I've pointed out that he uses gamblers fallacy in very obscure way, as he insists you need to go back to betting 1 dollar once you've won. This appears to be an obscure case of gamblers fallacy to me as it implies there is some hidden force which are changing the odds on each individual coin toss.</p>
","<p>Let's play out your specific scenario: you start with \$50 and want to stop at \$100.  That means you need to play your sequence (double until you win) 50 times without busting.</p>

<p>However, if your sequence begins with six losses, then you are busted, because you just lost $1+2+4+8+16+32=63$ dollars, and your system requires you to have \$64 left to bet.  Six losses in a row happens $1/2^6=\frac{1}{64}$ of the time.</p>

<p>To avoid 6 losses in a row, happens $\frac{63}{64}$ of the time, and you need to do this 50 times, so $(\frac{63}{64})^{50}\approx 0.455$.  Hence, if all you need to do is avoid six losses, there is about a 45% chance of ""winning"", i.e. getting to \$100.</p>

<p>However, there are other circumstances when you bust; at the beginning even five losses in a row will bust you, since $1+2+4+8+16=31$ dollars, and you need to bet \$32.  Hence until you get to \$63, you need to avoid five losses in a row.  Thus, the true answer is $$\left(\frac{31}{32}\right)^{13}\left(\frac{63}{64}\right)^{37}\approx 0.370$$
Thus your friend's system has a 37% chance of getting to \$100, and a 63% chance of getting to \$0.  You are much better off just betting the whole \$50 in a single bet.</p>

"Proving a subset is a subspace of a Vector Space","32020","","<p>To prove a subset is a subspace of a vector space we have to prove that the same operations (closed under vector addition and closed under scalar multiplication) on the Vector space apply to the subset. Fine, I get this.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let $W = \{(a,b,c)|a\geq b\}$ be a subset of the vector space $V$. Show that $W$ is a subspace of $V$.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>My question is, considering what the question is asking, basically how do I solve this? How to test whether it is closed under scalar multiplication when there are two vectors involved? How do I bring in $a\geq b$ in the answer? </p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
","<p>To show a subset is a subspace, you need to show three things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Show it is closed under addition.</li>
<li>Show it is closed under scalar multiplication.</li>
<li>Show that the vector $0$ is in the subset.</li>
</ol>

<p>To show 1, as you said, let $w_{1} = (a_{1}, b_{1}, c_{1})$ and $w_{2} = (a_{2}, b_{2}, c_{2})$.  Suppose $w_{1}$ and $w_{2}$ are in our subset.  Then they must satisfy $a_{1} \geq b_{1}$ and $a_{2} \geq b_{2}$.  We need to check that $w_{1} + w_{2}$ is in our subset, that is, we need to check that if</p>

<p>$$w_{1} + w_{2} = (a_{1} + a_{2}, b_{1} + b_{2},c_{1} + c_{2})$$</p>

<p>then it satisfies that the first coordinate is greater than or equal to the second coordinate.  Is $a_{1} + a_{2} \geq b_{1} + b_{2}$?  Yes, by adding the two inequalities $a_{1} \geq b_{1}$ and $a_{2} \geq b_{2}$ together.  So $w_{1} + w_{2}$ is in our subset.</p>

<p>For 2, we need to show that if $\alpha$ is any scalar, then if $w_{1} = (a_{1}, b_{1}, c_{1})$ is in our subset, so is $\alpha w_{1}$.  But $\alpha w_{1} = (\alpha a_{1}, \alpha b_{1}, \alpha c_{1})$.  We know since $w_{1}$ is in our subset that $a_{1} \geq b_{1}$.  We need to check that for any $\alpha$, $\alpha a_{1} \geq \alpha b_{1}$.  This inequality is definitely true if $\alpha \geq 0$, but we need it to be true for all $\alpha$, and it's not, because if $\alpha$ is negative, then multiplying the inequality $a_{1} \geq b_{1}$ on both sides by a negative number makes the inequality flip.  So we would get $\alpha a_{1} \leq \alpha b_{1}$ if $\alpha &lt; 0$, which means the inequality doesn't hold.  Thus, if $\alpha &lt; 0$, then $\alpha w_{1}$ is <em>not</em> in our subset because it doesn't satisfy $\alpha a_{1} \geq \alpha b_{1}$.</p>

<p>So our subset is <em>not</em> a subspace because it doesn't satisfy 2 (it is not closed under scalar multiplication, because any negative scalar would cause this problem).</p>

<p>First, here is the definition of a limit/interior point (not word to word from Rudin) but these definitions are worded from me (an undergrad student) so please correct me if they are not rigorous. The context here is basic topology and these are metric sets with the distance function as the metric. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A point $p$ of a set $E$ is a limit point if every neighborhood of $p$
  contains a point $q \neq p$ such that $ q \in E$</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, an interior point is defined as </p>

  neighborhood $N_r\{p\}$ that is contained in $E$ (ie, is a subset of
  E).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand interior points. Ofcourse given a point $p$ you can have any radius $r$ that makes this neighborhood fit into the set. Thats how I see it, thats how I picture it.</p>

<p>I can't understand limit points. It seems trivial to me that lets say you have a point $p$. Then one of its neighborhood is exactly the set in which it is contained, right? ie, you can pick a radius big enough that the neighborhood fits in the set. </p>

<p>Ofcourse I know this is false. Our professor gave us an example of a subset being the integers. He said this subset has no limit points, but I can't see how. </p>
","<p>I understand in your comment above to Jonas' answer that you would like these things to be broken down into simpler terms.</p>

<p>Think about limit points visually. Suppose you have a point $p$ that is a limit point of a set $E$. What does this mean? In plain terms (sans quantifiers) this means no matter what ball you draw about $p$, that ball will always contain a point of $E$ <em>different from</em> $p.$</p>

<p>For example, look at Jonas' first example above. What you should do wherever you are now is draw the number line, the point $0$, and then points of the set that Jonas described above. Namely draw $1, 1/2, 1/3,$ etc (of course it would not be possible to draw all of them!!).</p>

<p>Now an open ball in the metric space $\mathbb{R}$ with the usual Euclidean metric is just an open interval of the form $(-a,a)$ where $a\in \mathbb{R}$. Now we claim that $0$ is a limit point. How?</p>

<p>Given me an open interval about $0$. For now let it be $(-0.5343, 0.5343)$, a random interval I plucked out of the air. The question now is does this interval <em>contain</em> a point $p$ of the set $\{\frac{1}{n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ different from $0$? Well sure, because by the archimedean property of the reals given any $\epsilon &gt; 0$, we can find $n \in N$ such that </p>

<p>$$0 &lt; \frac{1}{n} &lt; \epsilon.$$</p>

<p>In fact you should be able to see from this immediately that whether or not I picked the open interval $(-0.5343,0.5343)$, $(-\sqrt{2},\sqrt{2})$ or any open interval.</p>

<p>Now let us look at the set $\mathbb{Z}$ as a subset of the reals. What you do now is get a paper, draw the number line and draw some dots on there to represent the integers. Can you see why <em>you are able to draw a ball around an integer that does not contain any other integer</em>?</p>

<p>Having understood this, looks at the following definition below:</p>

<p>$\textbf{Definition:}$ Let $E \subset X$ a metric space. We say that $p$ is a limit point of $E$ if for all $\epsilon &gt; 0$, $B_{\epsilon} (p)$ contains a point of $E$ different from $p$.</p>

<p>$\textbf{The negation:} $ A point $p$ is not a limit point of $E$ if <em>there exists some $\epsilon > 0$</em> such that $B_{\epsilon} (p)$ contains no point of $E$ different from $p$.</p>

<p>From the negation above, can you see now why <em>every point of $\mathbb{Z}$</em> satisfies the negation? You already know that you are able to draw a ball around an integer that does not contain any other integer.</p>

<p>The theorem makes use of the Axiom of Choice (AC), which says that if you have a collection of sets then there is a way to select one element from each set. It has been proved that AC cannot be derived from the rest of set theory but must be introduced as an additional axiom. Since AC can be used to derive counterintuitive results such as the Banach-Tarski theorem, some mathematicians are very careful to specify when their arguments depend on AC.</p>

<p>Here is a formal statement of AC. Suppose we have a set $W$ and a rule associating a nonempty set $S_w$ to each $w \in W$. Then AC says that there is a function 
$$f:W \to \bigcup_{w \in W} S_w$$
such that for all $w \in W$
$$f(w) \in S_w$$</p>

<p>Step3. divide by 3, </p>

<p>Step4. add 1 to it </p>

<p>Step5. Press these keys x,=  13 times

<p>On asking these to my maths teacher , in addition to these he told me that how to take out nth root  [if we want to take out 7th root of 128 which is (128)^1/7 =2 ] it can be also done using a simple calculator.</p>

<p>We have to repeat the same process but in step 3 instead of dividing by 3 we have to divide by the number n that is nth root [ if we want to take 7th root of 128 which is (128)^1/7 then in third step you have to divide it by 7 ] rest of the method remains same.</p>

<p>So by this in simple calculator also nth root can be found.
So I want to know why it is happening so ?</p>
","<p>So the function you calculate for something like the $r$th root is $$\left(\frac{x^{\frac 1{2^{10}}}-1}r+1\right)^{2^{10}}$$Well $2^{10}$ is just being used here as a suitable large number which doesn't kill the precision of your calculator. Let's use $n$ for $2^{10}$ and set $y_n=n(\sqrt [n]x-1)$.</p>

<p>Then we are calculating (for large $n$, so near the limit) $$f_n(x)=\left(1+\frac {y_n}{rn}\right)^n$$</p>

<p>Now $\lim_{n\to \infty} y_n=\ln x$. And the limit of the function $f_n$ (for constant $y$) is $e^{\frac yr}$ (these are both standard limits, though the second is better known than the first) and we have $$e^{\frac {\ln x}r}=e^{\ln x^{\frac 1r}}=\sqrt[r]x$$</p>

<p>The skill in getting the best precision for this method is in taking the square root (and then squaring back again) enough times to get close to the limit, without losing precision by dropping too many significant digits.</p>

"arrangement of NOT sitting together","31627","","<p>I have the following exercise. Please help me to solve it.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise</strong>. In how many ways can 3 men and 3 women be seated at a round table if </p>

<p><strong>(a)</strong> no restriction is imposed</p>

<p><strong>(b)</strong> 2 particular women must not sit together</p>

<p><strong>(c)</strong> each woman is to be between 2 men.</p>

<p><strong>Ideas</strong></p>

<p><strong>(a)</strong> simple case, it's just $5!$, I am still hardly getting the idea of round table and the first man taking any place. We don't count him because the table is round is it correct? So the table doesn't have the beginning and end, so we can start comparing permutation from any of the guests, therefore we don't count the first man, I still don't have good understanding why it happens.</p>

<p><strong>(b)</strong>
I've never saw the template for ""must not sit together"", usually when  the is a group that must sit together we take them as one guest and on addition count the permutation within the group, but here I don't know to reason about the solution. </p>

<p><strong>(c)</strong> extremely hard, I even don't have ideas.</p>

<p>I would appreciate for any help.</p>
","<p><strong>Problem 1</strong></p>

<p>You guessed right the answer is $5!$. The reason why we don't count the first is because the table doesn't have a beginning nor end. So let's say one combination is:</p>

<p>$${1,2,3,4,5,6}$$</p>

<p>Where men are numbered from $1-3$ and women are number from $4-6$. If we start counting from the last one we'll get a combination:</p>

<p>$${6,1,2,3,4,5}$$</p>

<p>But these combination are completely the same, so to avoid double counting we fix one as our stating point.</p>

<p>To make it even simpler. There are $6!$ combinations, but note there are 6 people and we can start counting from anyone so every combination will be included six times, so we divide by $6$. That's:</p>

<p>$$\frac{6!}{6} = 5!$$</p>

<p><strong>Problem 2</strong></p>

<p>It'll be much easier to count the ""bad"" combinations and subtract them from the total number of combinations. We could think of them two as one person, so there will be 5 people to sit down.</p>

<p>This means that there are $5!$ combination. But for the same reason we mentioned earlier we'll divide that number by 5. But note that when we ""split"" the two women the can sit in two different ways. So we'll have to multiply the number of combinations by 2. So the number of ""bad"" combinations is:</p>

<p>$$\frac{5!}{5} \cdot 2 = 4!\times2$$</p>

<p>And the total number of combinations that satisfy the condition is:</p>

<p>$$\frac{6!}{6} - 4!\times2 = 120 - 48 = 72$$</p>

<p><strong>Problem 3</strong></p>

<p>This is a type of stars and bars combinatorics, but because there are 3 men and 3 women, that implies that the order must be alternating, so it'll be easier to come up with our own ""formula""</p>

<p>Let $1,3,5$ be ""male places"" and $2,4,6$ be ""female places"". For the male places there are $3!$ number of ways, so does for the female places. But note that this time we have to divide by $3$, as there are 3 persons to start counting from. So the total number of combination is:</p>

<p>$$\frac{3!\cdot3!}{3} = 2! \cdot3! = 12$$</p>

<p>I don't understand why it's not enough that $f$ is bounded. I think the limit of a sequence of continuous functions is continuous and then if $f$ is bounded, it's in $C_b(X)$. So what is this $\lim f_n \in \mathbb{R}$ about? Many thanks for your help.</p>
","<p>Let $(B(X), \|\cdot\|_\infty)$ be the space of bounded real-valued functions with the sup norm. This space is complete. </p>

<p>Proof: We claim that if $f_n$ is a Cauchy sequence in $\|\cdot\|_\infty$ then its pointwise limit is its limit and in $B(X)$, i.e. it's a real-valued bounded function:</p>

<p>Since for fixed $x$, $f_n(x)$ is a Cauchy sequence in $\mathbb R$ and since $\mathbb R$ is complete its limit is in $\mathbb R$ and hence the pointwise limit $f(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty } f_n(x)$ is a real-valued function. It is also bounded: Let $N$ be such that for $n,m \geq N$ we have $\|f_n - f_m\|_\infty &lt; \frac{1}{2}$. Then for all $x$</p>

<p>$$ |f(x)| \leq |f(x) - f_N(x)| + |f_N(x)| \leq \|f - f_N \|_{\infty} + \|f_N \|_{\infty}$$</p>

<p>where $\|f - f_N \|_{\infty} \leq \frac12$ since for $n \geq N$, $ |f_n(x) - f_N(x)| &lt; \frac12$ for all $x$ and hence $|f(x) - f_N(x)| = |\lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(x) - f_N(x)| = \lim_{n \to \infty} |f_n(x) - f_N(x)| \color{\red}{\leq} \frac12$ (not $&lt;$!) for all $x$ and hence $\sup_x |f(x) - f_N(x)| = \|f-f_N\|_\infty \leq \frac12$.</p>

<p>To finish the proof we need to show $f_n$ converges in norm, i.e. $\|f_N - f\|_\infty \xrightarrow{N \to \infty} 0$:</p>

<p>Let $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. Let $N$ be such that for $n,m \geq N$ we have $\|f_n-f_m\|_\infty &lt; \varepsilon$. Then for all $n \geq N$</p>

<p>$$ |f(x) - f_n(x)| = \lim_{m \to \infty} |f_m(x) - f_n(x)| \leq \varepsilon $$</p>

<p>I don't really know where to start. I tried summing the Binomial coefficient, but it repeats sets.
Any ideas to get me going? Thanks!</p>
","<p>The number of functions from a set $X$ to another set $Y$ is given by $|Y|^{|X|}$ since each element in the set $X$ has $|Y|$ choices.</p>

<p>Hence, in the first case, you have a total of $2^n$ functions. To count the number of onto(surjective) functions, the easier way in this case is to subtract out the number of functions which are not onto. In this case, there are only two functions which are not unto, namely the function which maps every element to $1$ and the other function which maps every element to $2$. Hence, the total number of onto functions is $2^n-2$.</p>

<p>In the second case, the total number of functions is $n^2$. To count the number of one-to-one(injective) functions, all we need is $1$ and $2$ must map to distinct elements. If the function is one-to-one, then the number of choices for $1$ is $n$. Once we know where $1$ has been mapped to the number of choices for $2$, so that the function is one-to-one, is $n-1$. Hence, the total number of injective functions is $n(n-1)$.</p>

Let $$y=\sqrt{t^2+6t}\\y^2=t^2+6t \\ t^2+6t-y^2=0\\t=\frac{-6\pm\sqrt{36+4y^2}}{2}$$<br>

So the range of the function will be $[0,\infty)$.

A more specific method for $f(x)=\sqrt{ax^2+bx+c}$ :<br>
First of all, range($R_f$) $\subseteq [0,\infty)$.<br>
The range of $ax^2+bx+c$ is $[-\frac{b^2-4ac}{4a},\infty)$ if $a&gt;0$ and $(-\infty,-\frac{b^2-4ac}{4a}]$ if $a&lt;0$.<br>
So, the range of $f(x)$ will be the square root of bounds of intersection of $[0,\infty)$ and the range for $ax^2+bx+c$.</p>

<p><hr>
Here are some of the ""common rules"" for $f(x)$ to be real:<br>
1. If $f(x) = \frac 1a$, $a\ne 0$.<br>
2. If $f(x)=\sqrt{a}, a\ge0$.<br>

","<p>The reason is the following. We use the notation</p>

<p>$$\theta x^i:=\theta_0+\theta_1 x^i_1+\dots+\theta_p x^i_p. $$</p>

<p>Then</p>

<p>$$\log h_\theta(x^i)=\log\frac{1}{1+e^{-\theta x^i} }=-\log ( 1+e^{-\theta x^i} ),$$ $$\log(1- h_\theta(x^i))=\log(1-\frac{1}{1+e^{-\theta x^i} })=\log (e^{-\theta x^i} )-\log ( 1+e^{-\theta x^i} )=-\theta x^i-\log ( 1+e^{-\theta x^i} ),$$ [ this used: $ 1 = \frac{(1+e^{-\theta x^i})}{(1+e^{-\theta x^i})},$ the 1's in numerator cancel, then we used: $ \log(x/y) = \log(x) - \log(y) $  ]</p>

<p>Since our original cost function is the form of:</p>

<p>$$J(\theta)=-\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}y^{i}\log(h_\theta(x^{i}))+(1-y^{i})\log(1-h_\theta(x^{i}))$$</p>

<p>Plugging in the two simplified expressions above, we obtain
$$J(\theta)=-\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^m \left[-y^i(\log ( 1+e^{-\theta x^i})) + (1-y^i)(-\theta x^i-\log ( 1+e^{-\theta x^i} ))\right]$$, which can be simplified to:
$$J(\theta)=-\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^m \left[y_i\theta x^i-\theta x^i-\log(1+e^{-\theta x^i})\right]=-\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^m \left[y_i\theta x^i-\log(1+e^{\theta x^i})\right],~~(*)$$</p>

<p>where the second equality follows from</p>

<p>$$-\theta x^i-\log(1+e^{-\theta x^i})=

\log(1+e^{-\theta x^i} )
\right]=-\log(1+e^{\theta x^i}). $$ [ we used $ \log(x) + \log(y) = log(x y) $ ]</p>

<p>All you need now is to compute the partial derivatives of $(*)$ w.r.t. $\theta_j$. 
As</p>

<p>$$\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_j}y_i\theta x^i=y_ix^i_j, $$
$$\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_j}\log(1+e^{\theta x^i})=\frac{x^i_je^{\theta x^i}}{1+e^{\theta x^i}}=x^i_jh_\theta(x^i), $$</p>

"What is difference between a ring and a field?","31128","","<p>The ring axioms require that addition is commutative, addition and multiplication are associative, multiplication distributes over addition. </p>

<p>A field can be thought of as two groups with extra distributivity law. </p>

<p>A ring is more complex: with abelian group and a semigroup with extra distributivity law.</p>

<p>Is a ring a more basic structure than a field, or vice versa? What's the relation between them? What's the background why people study them?</p>
","<p>A ring is an ordered triple, $(R,+,\times)$, where $R$ is a set, $+\colon R\times R\to R$ and $\times\colon R\times R\to R$ are binary operations (usually written in in-fix notation) such that:</p>

<ol>
<li>$+$ is associative.</li>
<li>There exists $0\in R$ such that $0+a=a+0=a$ for all $a\in R$.</li>
<li>For every $a\in R$ there exists $b\in R$ such that $a+b=b+a=0$.</li>
<li>$+$ is commutative.</li>
<li>$\times$ is associative.</li>
<li>$\times$ distributes over $+$ on the left: for all $a,b,c\in R$, $a\times(b+c) = (a\times b)+(a\times c)$.</li>
<li>$\times$ distributes over $+$ on the right: for all $a,b,c\in R$, $(b+c)\times a = (b\times a)+(c\times a)$.</li>
</ol>

<p>1-4 tell us that $(R,+)$ is an abelian group. 5 tells us that $(R,\times)$ is a semigroup. 6 and 7 are the two distributive laws that you mention.</p>

<p>We also have the following items:</p>

<p>a. There exists $1\in R$ such that $1\times a = a\times 1 = a$ for all $a\in R$.</p>

<p>b. $1\neq 0$.</p>

<p>c. For every $a\in R$, $a\neq 0$, there exists $b\in R$ such that $a\times b = b\times a = 1$.</p>

<p>d. $\times$ is commutative.</p>

<p>A ring that satisfies (1)-(7)+(a) is said to be a ""ring with unity."" Clearly, every ring with unity is also a ring; it takes ""more"" to be a ring with unity than to be a ring.</p>

<p>A ring that satisfies (1)-(7)+(a,b,c) is said to be a <em>division ring</em>. Again, eveyr division ring is a ring, and it takes ""more"" to be a division ring than to be a ring. (5)+(a)+(b)+(c) tell us that $(R-\{0\},\times)$ is a group (note that we need to remove $0$ because (c) specifies nonzero, and we need (b) to ensure we are left with <em>something</em>). </p>

<p>A ring that satisfies (1)-(7)+(a,b,c,d) is a field.  Again, every field is a ring.</p>

<p>We do indeed have that $(R,+)$ is an abelian group, that $(R-\{0\},\times)$ is an abelian group, and that these structures ""mesh together"" via (6) and (7). In a ring, we have that $(R,+)$ is an abelian group, that $(R,\times)$ is a semigroup (or better yet, a semigroup with $0$), and that the two structures ""mesh well"". </p>

<p>We have that every field is a division ring, but there are division rings that are not fields (e.g., the quaternions); every division ring is a ring with unity, but there are rings with unity that are not division rings (e.g., the integers if you want commutativity, the $n\times n$ matrices with coefficients in, say, $\mathbb{R}$, $n\gt 1$, if you want noncommutativity); every ring with unity is a ring, but there are rings that are not rings with unity (strictly upper triangular $3\times 3$ matrices with coefficients in $\mathbb{R}$, for instance). So
$$\text{Fields}\subsetneq \text{Division rings}\subsetneq \text{Rings with unity} \subsetneq \text{Rings}$$

"Taylor series for $\sqrt{x}$?","31110","","<p>I'm trying to figure Taylor series for $\sqrt{x}$. Unfortunately all web pages and books show examples for $\sqrt{x+1}$. Is there any particular reason no one shows Taylor series for exactly $\sqrt{x}$?</p>
","<p><em>Short answer:</em> The Taylor series of $\sqrt x$ <strong>at $x_0 = 0$</strong> does not
exist because $\sqrt x$ is <em>not differentiable</em> at $0$.
For any $x_0 &gt; 0$, the Taylor series of $\sqrt x$ at $x_0$ can be computed
using the Taylor series of $\sqrt{1 + u}$ at $u_0 = 0$.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>Long answer:</em> The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Taylor series</a> of a function $f$
that is infinitely differentiable at a point $x_0$ is <em>defined</em> as</p>

<p>$$
  \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{f^{(n)}(x_0)}{n!}(x-x_0)^n = 
  f(x_0) + \frac{f'(x_0)}{1!}(x-x_0) + \frac{f''(x_0)}{2!}(x-x_0)^2 + \ldots \quad .
$$ 
Therefore:</p>

<ul>
<li>Asking for ""the Taylor series of $f$"" makes only sense if you specify
the point $x_0$. (Often this point is implicitly assumed as $x_0 = 0$, in
this case it is also called the <a href=""http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MaclaurinSeries.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Maclaurin series</a> of $f$.)</li>
<li>The Taylor series of $f$ at $x_0$ is only defined if $f$ is 
infinitely differentiable at $x_0$. (But the Taylor series need 
not be convergent for any $x \ne x_0$, and even if it converges in a 
neighborhood of $x_0$, the limit can be different from the given function $f$.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Each Taylor series is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_series"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">power series</a>
$
   \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n (x-x_0)^n 
$
and the connection is roughly the following: If there exists a power series
such that
$$
   f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n (x-x_0)^n \text{ in a neighborhood of $x_0$}
$$
then</p>

<ul>
<li>$f$ is infinitely differentiable at $x_0$, and</li>
<li>$a_n = {f^{(n)}(x_0)}/{n!}$ for all $n$, i.e. the power series is
exactly the Taylor series.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><em>Now applying that to your question:</em> You are asking for the Taylor series of $f(x) = \sqrt{ x}$.
If you meant the Taylor series at $x_0 = 0$: It is not <em>defined</em> because 
$\sqrt {x}$ is not differentiable at $x_0 = 0$. For the same reason, there is
no power series which converges to $f$ in a neighborhood of $0$.</p>

<p>But $f(x) = \sqrt{ x}$ can be developed into a Taylor series at any $x_0 &gt; 0$.
The general formula is given in
<a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1106362/42969"">Mhenni Benghorbal's answer</a>.
The reason that often only the Taylor series for $\sqrt{1 + x}$ is given
in the books is that – for the square-root function – the general case can easily be
reduced to the special case:
$$
   \sqrt {\mathstrut x} = \sqrt {\mathstrut x_0 + x - x_0} = \sqrt {\mathstrut x_0}\sqrt {1 + \frac {\mathstrut x-x_0}{x_0}}
$$
and now you can use the Taylor series of $\sqrt{1+u}$ at $u_0 = 0$.</p>

<p>The same ""trick"" would work for functions like $g(x) = x^\alpha$ because
$g(x) = g(x_0) \cdot g(1 + \frac {x-x_0}{x_0})$</p>

"What's the difference between arccos(x) and sec(x)","31098","","<p>My question might sound dumb, but I don't really see why the graphics of arccos(x) and sec(x) are different, because as far as I know arccos is the inverse cosine function (cos(x)^-1) and sec equals 1/cos (source Wolfram|Alpha). Then why aren't they equal?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
","<p>That's a problem of notation and probably a lack of definitions. We define $\sec x$ as the multiplicative inverse of $\cos x$, in other words, fixed $a \in \mathbb{R}$, $\sec a$ is the number such that $\sec a \cos a = 1$. Now $\arccos x$ is a little different thing: it's the inverse function of $\cos x$.</p>

<p>I don't know if you've learned this but the formal definition of a function is that of a collection of ordered pairs. In other words, since a function from a set $A$ to a set $B$ should be a rule assigning for each $a \in A$ some $b \in B$ we can simply <em>define</em> a function as the set of all ordered pairs of elements in $a$ together with related elements in $b$. However, we require the additional property that if $(a,b) \in f$ and if $(a,c)\in f$ then $b = c$ and this is just the formal way to state the ""vertical line rule"". Since the second element in each pair is unique we give it a name: if $(a,b) \in f$ then $b = f(a)$. Also to state starting and ending sets we write functions from $A$ to $B$ as $f: A \to B$.</p>

<p>Now, if you have a function you have a collection of ordered pairs right? So, you can create a new set of ordered pairs by reversing the pairs. So if $f : A \to B$ is a function from $A$ to $B$ we define the <em>inverse</em> $f^{-1}$ by the property that $(a,b) \in f^{-1}$ when $(b,a)\in f$. Now it's not at all clear when $f^{-1}$ is a function. Just to show you that consider the following function that maps naturals to naturals:</p>

<p>$$f = \{(1,2), (3,2), (4,1)\}\subset \mathbb{N}\times \mathbb{N}$$</p>

<p>This is a function by our definition. Now the inverse is $f^{-1} = \{(2,1), (2,3), (1,4)\}$, now this isn't a function because $(2,1)\in f^{-1}$ and $(2,3)\in f^{-1}$. So $f^{-1}$ will be a function if the original function also satisfies $f(x) = f(y)$ implying $x = y$. This kind of function is called one-one, and so if $f$ is one-one, $f^{-1}$ will be a function called then <strong><em>inverse function</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Also, if $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ has an inverse function $f^{-1}:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ then $f(f^{-1}(x)) = x$ and $f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$. So $\arccos$ is defined precisely this way: fixing one interval where $\cos$ is one-one, you define $\arccos$ in that interval by the property that $\arccos x$ is the number $y$ such that $\cos y = x,$ in other words, it returns you the value of angle whose cosine is $x$.</p>

<p>Just a reference to finish: you can find treatments like this in books like Spivak's Calculus or Apostol's Calculus Vol. 1. I hope the way I exposed this helps you a little. Good luck!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> The problem of notation I've mentioned and forgot talking about is that both the multiplicative inverse and the inverse function are in some contexts denoted by $\cos^{-1}$ and this usually happens to all trigonometric functions. So to avoid confusion, I recommend writing $\arccos$, $\arcsin$ and so on for the inverse functions.</p>

"'mod' or 'remainder' symbol valid in maths?","31075","","<p>I am trying to write the Euclidean algorithm in the following way:</p>

<p>$A = \lfloor A \div B \rfloor \times B + (\text{remainder of}) \: A \div B $ </p>

<p>Now is there any symbol I can use  to say ""remainder of A $\div$ B""? I know that in the C programming language there is the operator % for modulus; is that a valid symbol in maths? Can I write A % B? Or is there some other way?</p>
","<p>Per request, I post my comment(s) as an answer, and add some further remarks.</p>

<p>The notation $\rm\ a\ mod\ b\ $ denotes the remainder when dividing $\rm\,a\,$ by $\rm\,b\,$ using the division algorithm. The same notation is used in other domains that have an analogous (Euclidean) Division Algorithm, e.g. polynomials with coefficients over a field.</p>

<p>Also ""mod"" is also as a ternary relation (vs. binary operation) when dealing with congruence relations, e.g. $\rm\ a\equiv b\pmod n\iff n\mid a-b.$</p>

<p>The <em>operational</em> use of mod is often more convenient in <em>computational</em> contexts, whereas the <em>relational</em> use often yields more flexibility in <em>theoretical</em> contexts. The difference amounts to whether it is more convenient to work with canonical normal forms, or arbitrary equivalence classes. For example, imagine how inconvenient it would be to state the laws of fraction arithmetic if one required all fractions to be in normal (reduced) form, i.e. in lowest terms. Instead, it proves very flexible to work with arbitrary equivalent fractions, e.g. to choose both with a common denominator before adding fractions.</p>

<p>The use of the percent sign to denote mod (as in the C programming language) has not percolated to be standard in the mathematical community as far as I can tell. I recall many questions on sci.math regarding the meaning of $\rm\, a \% b.\, $ As such, if you use this notation in a mathematical forum then I recommend that you specify its meaning. This would not be necessary for ""mod"", since that notation is ubiquitous in mathematics. Be aware, however, that some mathematicians look down on the operational use of mod in the case when it would be more natural to use the congruence form. Apparently the mathematical Gods do too, since doing so can make some proofs quite more difficult (much more so than the simple fractional example mentioned above).</p>

<p>My idea, which remains unconfirmed with any source, is that a cross product can be thought of a vector which is orthogonal to all vectors which you are crossing.  If, and that's a big IF, this is right over all dimensions, we know that for a set of $n-1$ $n$-dimensional vectors, there exists a vector which is orthogonal to all of them.  The magnitude would have something to do with the area/volume/hypervolume/etc. made by the vectors we are crossing.</p>

<p>Am I right to guess that this multidimensional aspect of cross vectors exists or is that last part utter rubbish?</p>
","<p>Yes, you are correct.  You can generalize the cross product to $n$ dimensions by saying it is an operation which takes in $n-1$ vectors and produces a vector that is perpendicular to each one.  This can be easily defined using the exterior algebra and Hodge star operator <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodge_dual"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodge_dual</a>: the cross product of $v_1,\ldots,v_{n-1}$ is then just $*(v_1 \wedge v_2 \cdots \wedge v_{n-1}$).</p>

"Balls of 3 colours in a bag - Probability","30882","","<p>There are $12$ balls in a bag. $3$ of them are red, $4$ of them are green, and $5$ of them are blue. We randomly take out $3$ balls from the bag at the same time. What is the probability that all three balls are of the same colour?</p>

"Set theory: difference between belong/contained and includes/subset?","30867","","<p>This is a total noob question.</p>

<p>I am reading <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Naive-Theory-Undergraduate-Texts-Mathematics/dp/0387900926"" rel=""noreferrer"">Naive Set Theory by Paul R. Halmos</a>, and I'm having difficulty to understand something which seems to be trivial.</p>

<p>In the first chapter he writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If $x$ belongs to $A$ ($x$ is an element of $A$, $x$ is <em>contained</em> in $A$), we shall write</p>
  
  <p>$x\in A$</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand this.</p>

<p>Then, he write:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If $A$ and $B$ are sets and if every element of $A$ is an element of $B$, we say that $A$ is a <em>subset</em> of $B$, or $B$ <em>includes</em> $A$, and we write:</p>
  
  <p>$A \subset B$</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand this too.</p>

<p>Then he says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The working of the definition implies that each set must be considered to be included in itself ($A \subset A$); this fact is described by saying that set inclusion is <em>reflexive</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand this too.</p>

<p>But then:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Observe that belonging ($\in$) and inclusion ($\subset$) are conceptually very different things indeed. One important difference has already manifested itself above: inclusion is always reflexive, whereas it is not at all clear that belonging is every reflexive. That is: $A \subset A$ is always true;  is $A\in A$ ever true? It is certainly not true of any reasonable set that anyone has every seen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>And this is where I don't think I understand anything.</em>  There is not more elaboration on this point in the text.</p>

<p>I tried to skip this but it seems it is quite fundamental for understanding what follows in the book.</p>

<p>Could someone explain what is meant here? </p>
","<p>Whenever you come across something like this and it trips you up, you might want to look at particular examples.  For instance, consider {4}.  {4} $\subset$ {4}, but {4} $\epsilon$ {4} is false, since the only member of {4} is 4, not {4}.  It may have tripped you up that ""includes"" and ""contains"" in everyday language usually qualify as synonyms.  They don't here, and the terms get defined by the definitions for $\epsilon$ and $\subset$.  You might want to prove that A $\subset$ A for any set A as it can get proven in a line or two.</p>

"Are there real-life relations which are symmetric and reflexive but not transitive?","30860","","<p>Inspired by Halmos (<strong><em>Naive Set Theory</em></strong>) . . .</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For each of these three possible properties [reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity], find a relation that does not have that property but does have the other two.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One can construct each of these relations and, in particular, a relation that is</p>

<h2>symmetric and reflexive but not transitive:</h2>

<p>$$R=\{(a,a),(a,b),(b,a),(b,b),(c,c),(b,c),(c,b)\}.$$</p>

<p>It is clearly not transitive since $(a,b)\in R$ and $(b,c)\in R$ whilst $(a,c)\notin R$. On the other hand, it is reflexive since $(x,x)\in R$ for all cases of $x$: $x=a$, $x=b$, and $x=c$. Likewise, it is symmetric since $(a,b)\in R$ and $(b,a)\in R$ and $(b,c)\in R$ and $(c,b)\in R$. However, this doesn't satisfy me.</p>

<h2>Are there real-life examples of $R$?</h2>

<p>In this question, I am asking if there are tangible and not directly mathematical examples of $R$: a relation that is reflexive and symmetric, but not transitive. For example, when dealing with relations which are symmetric, we could say that $R$ is equivalent to being married. Another common example is ancestry. If $xRy$ means $x$ is an ancestor of $y$, $R$ is transitive but neither symmetric nor reflexive.</p>

<p>I would like to see an example along these lines within the answer. Thank you.</p>
","<p>My favorite example is synonymy: certainly any word is synonymous with itself, and if you squint you can imagine that if a word appears in the thesaurus entry for another, then the latter will symmetrically appear in the thesaurus entry for the former. But synonymy is not transitive. </p>

<p>However this and many other examples are special cases of vertices joined by edges in graphs which is a canonical example of Tolerance:</p>

<p>Tolerance relations are binary reflexive, symmetric but generally not transitive relations historically introduced by Poincare', who distinguished the mathematical continuum from the physical continuum, then studied by Halpern, and most notably the topologist Zeeman. </p>

<p>Recent surveys include:</p>

<p>Peters &amp; Wasilewski's ""Tolerance spaces: origins, theoretical aspects and applications"" Info Sci 2012, and Sossinsky's ""Tolerance Space Theory"" Acta App Math 1986, which mentions these examples: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Metric space with distance between points less than $\epsilon$</p></li>
<li><p>Topological space with a fixed covering and 2 points both contained in one element of the cover</p></li>
<li><p>Vertices in the same simples of a simplicial complex</p></li>
<li><p>Vertices joined by an edge in an undirected graph</p></li>
<li><p>Sequences that differ by 1 (or 2, or 3) binary digits</p></li>
<li><p>Cosets in a group with nonempty intersection</p></li>
</ul>

<p>An intersting textbook that discusses tolerances is Pirlot &amp; Vincke's <a href=""http://books.google.com/books/about/Semiorders.html?id=rXroQjbQHn0C""><em>Semiorders</em></a>, 1997. </p>

<p>Sossinsky's paper goes on to mention:</p>

<p>(i) tolerance spaces appear quite naturally in the most varied branches of mathematics;</p>

<p>(ii) the tolerance setting is very convenient for the use of many existing powerful mathematical tools;</p>

<p>(iii) only results 'within tolerance' are usually required in practical applications.</p>

<p>and that ""tolerance, in a way, is a trick for avoiding the specific hazards of infinite-dimensional-function spaces, eg their local noncompactness; moreover, in a certain sense, in tolerance spaces, you can't have large finite dimensions""</p>

"What is vector division?","30854","","<p>My question is: 
We have addition, subtraction and muliplication of vectors. Why cannot we define vector division? What is division of vectors?</p>
","<p>As already mentioned in the comments you have two ways of ""multiplying"" vectors. You have the <em>dot product</em> and the <em>cross product</em>. However, the dot product isn't a product. </p>

<p>When you multiply two rational numbers, you get a rational number. When you multiply two matrices, you get a matrix. When you multiply two complex numbers, you get a complex number. So you would want your product to satisfy that the multiplication of two vectors gives a new vector. However, the dot product of two vectors gives a scalar (a number) and not a vector. </p>

<p>But you do have the cross product. The cross product of two (3 dimensional) vectors is indeed a new vector. So you actually have a product. It is still a bit of a strange product in that it is not commutative. $\vec{x}\times\vec{y}$ isn't (always) the same as $\vec{y}\times\vec{x}$.</p>

<p>Now about division. If you have two real numbers $x$ and $y\neq 0$, we say that $\frac{x}{y} = z$ exactly when $x = yz$. So in that sense you could define a type of division of vectors.</p>

<p>However, again there are some problems with vectors. When we divide by a real number $y$, we can also consider this as multiplying by the inverse of $y$, that is, $y^{-1}$. The inverse of $y$ is that unique number $y^{-1}$ such that $yy^{-1} = 1$. The number $1$ is that ""special"" number that satisfies that $1x = x$ for all real numbers $x$. And you see that any (nonzero) number <em>divided</em> is $1$. The question is: what would the equivalent of $1$ be for vectors?</p>

<p>With vectors, you don't have such a ""unit"". There is no vector $\vec{1}$ such that the cross product of $\vec{1}$ with any other vector $\vec{x}$ is $\vec{x}$, that is, $\vec{1}\times \vec{x} = \vec{x}$.</p>

<p>So that is way we don't really have a division of vectors that ""works"" just like division of real numbers do.</p>

"how many semantically different boolean functions are there for n boolean variables?","30853","","<p>In short, this is an assignment question for a course I am taking - the exact wording is this:</p>

<p>""Given n Boolean variables, how many 'semantically' different Boolean functions can you construct?""</p>

<p>Now, I had a crack at this myself - and got pretty stuck. The question doesnt state how many boolean operators there are (and, or, xor, nand, nor, iff, implies, not) nor does it state whether brackets should be used, i.e. a ^ (b v c) is different from (a ^ b) v c.</p>

<p>So, my question for you is - is this question possible given the limited information available? </p>

<p>Is it going to be something like ${n^x}$ where x is the number of boolean operators.</p>

<p>Any direction here would be greatly appreciated. </p>
","<p>This question, in a sense, is a question of combinations.</p>

<p>We can start with a single-valued function of Boolean variables.  I claim that there are $2^n$ combinations of a single-valued function.  For instance, if we start with one variable, there are two combinations; namely, $a$ and $\neg a$.  If we have two variables, there are four combinations.  This is because we can have, for $a$, either $a$ or $\neg a$.  Then, for $b$, we can have either $b$ or $\neg b$.  So there are four combinations between these two variables.  Similarly, for three variables, there are $2 \times 2 \times 2=2^3$ combinations between these variables.</p>

<p>Now, to consider the set of <em>ALL</em> Boolean functions, we have to consider again each of these combinations.  We can say that there are $2^\text{combinations}$ different combinations between Boolean variables.  This is because, for each combination, it can be true or false.  So in the paragraph above, we have stated that there are $2^n$ combinations between the variables.  Each of these combinations can be true or false for a particular variable assignment.  So, again, we get $2^\text{combinations} = 2^{(2^n)}$ combinations between them all.</p>

<p>and then i plotted them on graph and got the answer : dcbea
but when i submitted the answer it seems to be incorrect.
What i am doing wrong?</p>
","<p>To answer @sol4me <em>If you know some better way then please share, i will be glad to know.</em></p>

<p>First, never trust a plot. You just saw it may hurt, so even if it <em>can</em> help, it's not a proof.</p>

<p><br/>
Then, you must know some basic comparison scales, for example, as $n\rightarrow \infty$, and fixed $a&gt;0, b&gt;0, c&gt;1$ and any real $d$,</p>

<p>$$d \ll \log \log n \ll \log^a n \ll n^b \ll c^n \ll n! \ll n^n$$</p>

<p>Where I write $a_n \ll b_n$ iff $\frac{a_n}{b_n} \rightarrow 0$ (this is <strong>not</strong> a standard notation !)</p>

<p>Of course, there are many other possibles asymptotic comparisons, these are just the most frequent.</p>

<p>You have also some allowed operations, for example,</p>

<ul>
<li>if $\xi&gt;1$ is a fixed real and $1 \ll a_n \ll b_n$, then $\xi^{a_n} \ll \xi^{b_n}$.</li>
<li>if $s_n \ll a_n$ and $s_n \ll b_n$, and if $a_n \ll b_n$, then $a_n + s_n \ll b_n + s_n$.</li>
</ul>

<p>You prove such things by computing the limit. Taking $\log$ as you did may be very useful (for example in the first case above).</p>

<p><br/>
Finally, you have to apply these comparisons to your case, and sometimes it's a bit tricky, but honestly here it's not.</p>

<ul>
<li>$n^2 \ll 2^n$ so $2^{n^2} \ll 2^{2^n}$</li>
<li>$2 \ll n$, so $2^{2^n} \ll
   n^{2^n}$. If in doubt, write the quotient
$a_n=\left(\frac{2}{n}\right)^{2^n}$, and since
$\frac{2}{n}&lt;\frac{1}{2}$ as soon as $n&gt;4$, you have $a_n \rightarrow
   0$</li>
<li>$1 \ll \log n $, so $n^2 \ll n^2 \log n$, and since $n \ll n^2$, you have $n \ll n^2\log n$.</li>
<li>$n \ll n^2$ so $2^n \ll 2^{n^2}$, and also $\log n \ll n$ so $n^2 \log n \ll n^3$. Then $n^3 \ll 2^n$, hence $n^2\log n \ll n^3 \ll 2^n \ll 2^{n^2}$, and especially $n^2 \log n \ll 2^{n^2}$.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you have a doubt, write what the comparison means as a limit, and compute the limit.</p>

<p>And remember, these comparisons are <em>asymptotic</em>. Sometimes the smallest $n$ such that the inequality really holds may be <em>very</em> large, but it's nevertheless only a fixed, finite number. You may have inequality for $n&gt; 10^{10^{10}}$ for example, so trying to plot things is often hopeless.</p>

<p>If you want to know more about such methods, there are good readings, such as <em>Concrete Mathematics</em>, by Graham, Knuth and Patashnik.</p>

<p>That's the difference.</p>

<p>As for ""looking the same"", they're pretty different: Both are positive and go asymptotically to $0$, but with, for example $y=(1/2)^x$, the value of $y$ actually cuts in half every time $x$ increases by $1$, whereas, with $y = x^{-2}$, notice what happens as $x$ increases from $1\text{ million}$ to $1\text{ million}+1$.  The amount by which $y$ gets multiplied is barely less than $1$, and if you put ""billion"" in place of ""million"", then it's even closer to $1$.  With the exponential function, it always gets multiplied by $1/2$ no matter how big $x$ gets.</p>

<p>I assume that as in part 2 you have a right angled triangle. In this case you can work out the angle given two of the sides. Depending on which sides you have, you should choose sin, cos or tan, as shown in the diagram below.
$$\begin{align}
\sin d &amp;= \frac{\text{opposite side}}{\text{hypoteneuse side}} \\
\cos d &amp;= \frac{\text{adjacent side}}{\text{hypoteneuse side}} \\
\tan d &amp;= \frac{\text{opposite side}}{\text{adjacent side}} \\
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>There are relationships between the different trig functions, e.g. $\sin d  = \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 d}$. However it's a lot easier to find them directly given a standard right-angled triangle problem.</p>

<p>For reference, the identities that you can use are:</p>

<p>$$\begin{align}
\sin^2 x+\cos^2 x&amp;=1 \\
\tan^2 x+1&amp;=\sec^2 x, \;\;\;\;\;\,
\text{where } \sec x = 1/\cos x\\
1+\cot^2 x&amp;=\mathrm{cosec}^2 x, \;\;\;
\text{where } \cot x = 1/\tan x, \mathrm{cosec}\,x=1/\sin x
\end{align}$$</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2 If you know the sides you can work out the angles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you know the angle you can work out the length of the sides. Is this a correct assumption? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, see the right-hand side of the diagram. You can have similar triangles where the angles are all the same but the side lengths are scaled up or down by some factor, like Russian dolls.</p>

<p>If you think about it, this makes sense, because all the sin, cos, or tan gives you is the <em>ratio</em> between sides. E.g. for sin, how many times bigger is the opposite side than the hypoteneuse.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, is it correct so assume that if you know one of the angles besides the 90 degree angle and 1 length of one side you can determine the sine, cosine and tangent of that triangle?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Strictly speaking, we talk about the sine, cosine and tangent of angles not triangles. A typical problem setting is that you are given one of the angles and one of the sides in a right-angled triangle. You can then work out the length of another side. E.g. if you have an angle $d$ and the opposite side you can rearrange the sine formula to find the hypoteneuse side.</p>

<p>$$\begin{align}
\sin d &amp;= \frac{\text{opposite side}}{\text{hypoteneuse side}} \\
\text{hypoteneuse side}\times\sin d &amp;= \text{opposite side} \\
\text{hypoteneuse side} &amp;= \frac{\text{opposite side}}{\sin d}
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>Also note that if you have one angle and the 90 degree angle you can work out the third angle because the angles add to 180 degrees. And you can then work out all the side -- but you need at least one side to fix the scale factor as discussed above.   </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And if you know two sides you can always determine the angle? Is that a correct assumption?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes that's correct. See part 1.</p>

$$ \sum_{t=0}^n \binom{t}{k} = \binom{n+1}{k+1}. $$

$$ \sum_{t=0}^n A + Bt + C\binom{t}{2} = A(n+1) + B\binom{n+1}{2} + C\binom{n+1}{3}. $$

<p>This recurrence actually never converges, from any real starting point.
Indeed, $$x_2 = 1-\frac{1}{x_1}; \\ x_3 = 1-\frac{1}{1-1/x_1} = 1-\frac{x_1}{x_1-1} = \frac{1}{1-x_1}; \\ x_4 = x_1$$</p>

"Expected Ratio of Coin Flips","30452","","<blockquote>
  <p>If you flip a coin until you decide to stop and you want to maximize
  the ratio of heads to total flips, what is that expected ratio?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Assuming that you want to maximize the ratio, meaning whether you flip again or not depends on the chances of whether you will risk more than you gain, I have gotten that:</p>

<ul>
<li>if the probability is 50/50 (same number of heads and tails so far),
you flip again</li>
<li>if there are more tails than heads you flip again  </li>
<li>if you have more heads then tails you don't flip</li>
</ul>

<p>How do you put this into an equation form to solve for expected ratio?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","<p>Your bullet points amount to saying that you're going to flip the coin until the number of heads exceeds the number of tails. Suppose that this happens on the $n$-th flip; then after $n-1$ flips you must have had equal numbers of heads and tails, so $n=2m+1$ for some $m$, you now have $m+1$ heads, and the ratio of heads to flips is $\frac{m+1}{2m+1}$. If $p_n$ is the probability of stopping after the $(2n+1)$-st flip, the expected ratio of heads to flips is $$\sum_{n\ge 0}\frac{p_n(n+1)}{2n+1}\;.$$ Thus, the first step is to determine the $p_n$.</p>

<p>Clearly $p_0=\frac12$: we stop after $1$ toss if and only if we get a head. If we stop after $2n+1$ tosses, where $n&gt;0$, the last toss must be a head, half of the first $2n$ tosses must be heads, and for $k=1,2,\dots,2n$ the first $k$ tosses must not include more heads than tails. The problem of counting such sequences is well-known: these are Dyck words of length $2n$, and there are $C_n$ of them, where $$C_n=\frac1{n+1}\binom{2n}n$$ is the $n$-th <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number#Applications_in_combinatorics"">Catalan number</a>. Each of those $C_n$ sequences occurs with probability $\left(\frac12\right)^{2n}$, and each is followed by a head with probability $\frac12$, so $$p_n=C_n\left(\frac12\right)^{2n}\cdot\frac12\;,$$ and the expected ratio is $$\frac12\sum_{n\ge 0}C_n\left(\frac12\right)^{2n}\frac{n+1}{2n+1}=\frac12\sum_{n\ge 0}\frac1{4^n(2n+1)}\binom{2n}n\;.$$</p>

<p>Very conveniently, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_trigonometric_functions#Infinite_series"">Taylor series for $\arcsin x$</a> is $$\arcsin x=\sum_{n\ge 0}\frac1{4^n(2n+1)}\binom{2n}nx^{n+1}\;,$$ valid for $|x|\le 1$, so the expected ratio is $$\frac12\sum_{n\ge 0}\frac1{4^n(2n+1)}\binom{2n}n=\frac12\arcsin 1\approx 0.7854\;.$$</p>

"Can decimal numbers be considered ""even"" or ""odd""?","30374","","<p>Is the concept of even/odd numbers is applicable to decimal numbers? For e.g. - 4.222 is a even number?</p>
","<p>I am not saying that this is a way to consider ""even"" and ""odd"" numbers, but I think it's quite cool that it looks somehow as a generalization of this notion. </p>

<p>It doesn't make sense to look at the digits of an irrational number to determine its ""parity"", hence let's just stick with rational numbers. </p>

<p>When we were looking at integers, we said that an integer was <em>even</em> when it was divisible by $2$ and <em>odd</em> when it is not. Instead of using words, we could give much better information, which is to define a map 
$$
\begin{align}
\nu_2 : \mathbb N &amp; \to \mathbb N \cup \{ 0 \} \\
n=2^k m &amp; \mapsto k
\end{align}
$$
where in the latter, $m$ is odd. The map $\nu$ then measures how <em>even</em> the integer $n$ is, in the sense that when there are more powers of 2 that divide $n$, it is considered ""more divisible by two"". </p>

<p>This concept can be generalized to the rational numbers : write $x = a/b$ with $a$ and $b \neq 0$ integers. Write $a = 2^{k_1} a'$ and $b=2^{k_2} b'$, so that $x = 2^{k_1 - k_2} (a'/b')$ and now both $a'$ and $b'$ are odd. Now define $\nu$ again in a similar manner :
$$
\begin{align}
\nu_2 : \mathbb Q &amp; \to \mathbb Z \\
x = \frac{2^{k_1}a'}{2^{k_2}b'} &amp; \mapsto k_1 - k_2.
\end{align}
$$
When $x$ is an integer, we recover the map we had before, so this can be considered as an <em>extension</em> of this map to the rational numbers. </p>

<p>I don't know if you have done some abstract algebra, but I am going to work things out a little more so that readers that might be interested find good information here. </p>

<p>If we replace $\nu_2$ by $\nu_p$, where $p$ is a prime number, all that we did works just fine and we get a map from $\mathbb Q$ to $\mathbb Z$ which indicates how much can a rational be divisible by $p$ (by allowing ""negative divisibility"" in some sense, because it also measures how many times $p$ divides the denominator). We are getting close to the concept of a <em>discrete valuation</em>, which is defined as the following : given a field $K$, a discrete valuation $\nu$ is a function from $K^{\times}$, the group of units, to $\mathbb Z$, which satisfies the following properties :
$$
\begin{align}
\nu(ab) &amp; = \nu(a) + \nu(b) \\
\nu(a+b) &amp; \ge \min \{ \nu(a),\nu(b) \}
\end{align}
$$
and must also be surjective. This function has many interesting algebraic properties. Recalling informations we had before such as ""the set of all even integers form a ring"", and just by considering this map and its properties, we can show that 
$$
\{ x \in K^{\times} \, | \, \nu(x) \ge 0 \} \cup \{ 0 \}
$$ 
is a subring of $K$ which contains the identity of $K$. For some examples of how this is relevant, consider this : if we take the map $\nu_2$ we had before (over $\mathbb Q$), proving this fact means that the set of all rational numbers with odd denominator form a subring of $\mathbb Q$ (and so does the set of all rational numbers with denominators coprime to $p$). Valuations are extensively studied, and you can probably look it up on Wikipedia or ask for a reference if you are more interested in this.</p>

I have been trying to search the web for information about how to proceed in these cases but all I have found is long theorems of summation or explanations of very simple operations with the summation notation. I have found, nevertheless, the answer to my question which is as follows:
$$S = \sum^n_{i=0}(x_i - C)^2$$</p>

<p>$$\frac{\partial S}{\partial C} = \sum^n_{i=0} 2 (x_i - C)(-1) = -2 \sum^n_{i=0} (x_i - C)$$</p>

<p>Third step, I get this one.</p>

<p>Fourth, where is this $nC$ coming from? What does it mean? 
I understand that at the end what he is doing is  $ \sum^n_{i=0} x_i= nC$ so it isolates $C$ and he finally gets the result  $C = \frac{\sum^n_{i=0} X_i}{n}$. Any reasons though why he chooses to swap $\sum^n_{i=0} C$ instead of $\sum^n_{i=0} x_i$ for $nC$?</p>

<p>Thanks a lot, I'd really appreciate if you could please refer me to any page you might know about summation which doesn't go about 1000 theorems and properties . Unfortunately I can spend much time on summation as I have many other topics in my exam that I need to cover and this is just a small part of it. Cheers!</p>
","<p><strong>First step</strong></p>

<p>Think of the sum as a function. To find a minima/maxima for a certain function we need to find it's derivative and set it to 0. And because we have 2 terms in between the parenthesis, we can't just apply the rule $\frac{\partial}{\partial x} x^n = nx^{n-1}$, but instead we apply the chain rule. So that -2 is from the chain rule.</p>

<p><strong>Second step</strong></p>

<p>Let's denote the derivative of the sum as $S_1$, the when $2S_1 = 0$? It's only possible if $S_1 =0$, so we left out the 2.</p>

<p>$C$ is a constant that's independent from $n$ so after every step we just add $C$. If $n$ is the number of steps then we have added $nC$</p>

How do we make a list of all $\dbinom{n+1}{k}$ ways to choose $k$ out of these $n+1$? Here's how: first make a list of all ways to choose $k$ out of the original $n$ objects. That's a partial list. All of its items exclude the ""new"" object. It has $\dbinom nk$ items. Then take the list you already had, of all ways to pick $k-1$ out of those $n$.

<p>Thank you so much!</p>
","<p>In general, for jointly continuous random variables $X$ and $Y$ with joint pdf
$f_{X,Y}(x,y)$,
$$E[g(X,Y)]=\int_{-\infty}^\infty\int_{-\infty}^\infty g(x,y)f_{X,Y}(x,y)dx dy.$$ In the special case you are
considering, this becomes
$$E[XY]=\int_{-\infty}^\infty\int_{-\infty}^\infty xyf_{X,Y}(x,y)dx dy.$$</p>

<p>If $X$ and $Y$ are jointly continuous random variables with joint pdf 
$f_{X,Y}(x,y)$, and $f_{X,Y}(x,y)$ factors into the product of
the marginal pdfs $f_X(x)$ and $f_Y(y)$, then $X$ and $Y$ are said
to be independent random variables.  More useful is the reverse
implication: if we assume that $X$ and $Y$ are independent continuous random
variables  with known pdfs (e.g. standard normal), then they are jointly
continuous with joint pdf $f_{X,Y}(x,y)$ equal to the product
$f_X(x)f_Y(y)$ of their individual pdfs.</p>

<p>Your expression $\displaystyle E[XY] = \int_{R\times R} xyf_X(x)f_Y(y)dxdy$
is <em>incorrect in the general case,</em> but is <em>correct
when $X$ and $Y$ are independent continuous random variables</em> since
$f_{X,Y}=f_X(x)f_Y(y)$ in this case. Indeed, if your expression <em>were</em>
correct in general, then we would have
$$E[XY] = \int_{R\times R} xyf_X(x)f_Y(y)dxdy = \int_{R} xf_X(x)dx
\int_{R} yf_Y(y)dy = E[X]E[Y]$$
so that $\text{cov}(X,Y)=E[XY]-E[X]E[Y] = 0$ for <em>all</em> random variables,
which is clearly not true.  So we have the following.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If $X$ and $Y$ are independent random variables, then $E[XY]=E[X]E[Y]$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that this holds for all random variables, not just continuous
random variables.  Also, as you probably know, the converse is not
true: uncorrelated random variables need not be independent.</p>

<p>With regard to your second question,
$X$ and $Y$ are independent if you can find $g(x)$ and $h(y)$ such that the 
equality $f_{X,Y}(x,y)=g(x)h(y)$ holds at <em>all</em> points $(x,y)$ in the plane, not just at some points.  If the joint pdf is nonzero only for $0&lt;x&lt;1,x&lt;y&lt;2x$, then $X$ and $Y$ are <em>dependent</em> random variables; no need to try and see if you can express $f(x,y)$ as $g(x)h(y)$.</p>

<p>Finally, note that all of the above applies provided the various integrals
and expectations are defined or exist.  $E[XY]=E[X]E[Y]$ does not apply
to independent Cauchy random variables, for example, because $E[X]$ and $E[Y]$
are undefined for Cauchy random variables $X$ and $Y$.</p>

"Calculating the Order of An Element in A Group","29952","","<p>First of all, I am very new to group theory. The order of an element $g$ of a group $G$ is the smallest positive integer $n: g^n=e$, the identity element. I understand how to find the order of an element in a group when the group has something to with modulo, for example, in the group $$U(15)=\text{the set of all
positive integers less than } n \text{ and relatively prime to } n$$ </p>

<p>$$\text{ which is a group under multiplication by modulo }n=\{1,2,4,7,8,11,13,14\}$$then $|2|=4$, because </p>

<p>\begin{align*}
&amp;2^1=2\\
&amp;2^2=4\\
&amp;2^3=8\\
&amp;2^4=16\mod15=1\\
&amp;\text{So } |2|=4.
\end{align*} </p>

<p>However, I don't understand how this works for groups that don't have any relation to modulo. Take $(\mathbb{Z},+)$ for instance. If I wanted to find the order of $3$, then I need to find $n:3^n$ is equal to the identity, which in this case is $0$.</p>

<p>I suppose my question can be summarized as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Does the order of an element only make sense if we are dealing with groups dealing with modulo?</p>
</blockquote>
","<p>Yes, it makes sense.  The order of an element $g$ in some group is the least positive integer $n$ such that $g^n = 1$ (the identity of the group), <em>if any such $n$ exists</em>.  If there is no such $n$, then the order of $g$ is defined to be $\infty$.</p>

<p>As noted in the comment by @Travis, you can take a small permutation group to get an example.  For instance, the permutation $(1,2,3,4)$ in the symmetric group $S_4$ of degree $4$ (all permutations of the set $\{1,2,3,4\}$) has order $4$. This is because 
$$(1,2,3,4)^1 = (1,2,3,4)\neq 1,$$
$$(1,2,3,4)^2 = (1,3)(2,4)\neq 1,$$
$$(1,2,3,4)^3 = (1,4,3,2)\neq 1$$
and
$$(1,2,3,4)^4 = 1,$$
so $4$ is the smallest power of $(1,2,3,4)$ that yields the identity.</p>

<p>For the additive group $\mathbb{Z}$ of integers, every non-zero element has infinite order.  (Of course, here, we use additive notation, so to calculate the order of $g\in\mathbb{Z}$, we are looking for the least positive integer $n$ such that $ng = 0$, if any.  But, unless $g = 0$, there is no such $n$, so the order of $g$ is $\infty$.)</p>

&amp;= 10^{-1}\left(\lfloor x10^{-k}\rfloor - x_k\right).

<p>Rearranging for $x_k$ we find $x_k = \lfloor x10^{-k}\rfloor - 10\lfloor x10^{-(k+1)}\rfloor$. Therefore, the number you are after is </p>

<p>\begin{align*}
\sum_{k=0}^nx_{n-k}10^k &amp;= \sum_{k=0}^n\left(\lfloor x10^{-(n-k)}\rfloor - 10\lfloor x10^{-(n-k+1)}\rfloor\right)10^k\\

&amp;= x10^n - 99\sum_{k=1}^n\lfloor x10^{-k}\rfloor10^{n-k}.

<p>Therefore, given a positive integer $x$, the integer which has the same digits in the reverse order is $$x10^{\lfloor \log_{10}x\rfloor} - 99\sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor \log_{10}x\rfloor}\lfloor x10^{-k}\rfloor10^{\lfloor \log_{10}x\rfloor-k}.$$</p>

"Discrete Fourier Transform: Effects of zero-padding compared to time-domain interpolation","29862","","<p>While studying the various algorithm implementations available on-line of the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm, I've come to a question related to the way the DFT works in theory.</p>

<p>Suppose you have a sequence of $N$ points $x_0, ..., x_{N-1}$. For $ k = 0, ..., N-1 $, let $ X_k = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n e^{-2ik\pi \frac{n}{N}} $.</p>

<p>I've noticed that many algorithms are easier to implement, or faster, when the size of the input can be expressed as a power of 2. To pad the signal, I've seen two approaches. </p>

<ul>
<li>Pad the signal with $0$s, settings $x_N, ..., x_{2^p-1} = 0$, and $X_k = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n e^{-2ik\pi \frac{n}{2^p}}$</li>
<li>Interpolate the original values, by setting $\tau=N/2^p$ the new spacing between consecutive points and then guessing the values at $0, \tau, 2\tau, ..., (2^p-1)\tau$ through linear interpolation.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've heard people saying different things: </p>

<p>Some people oppose the first approach very strongly (I recently had a discussion with a physics teacher about this). They say that padding the signal with extra zeros give you the Fourier coefficients of a different function, which will bear no relation to those of the original signal. On the other hand, they say that interpolation works great. </p>

<p>On the other hand, most libraries, if not all, that I have reviewed use the second solution.</p>

<p>All the references that I could find on the internet were pretty vague on this topic. Some say that the best band-limited interpolation that you can do in frequency domain is obtained through time-domain padding, but I couldn't find any proof of such statement.</p>

<p>Could you please help me figure out which advantages and drawbacks both approaches have? Ideally, I'm searching for something with a mathematical background, not only visual examples =)</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>Zero-padding in the time domain <a href=""https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/dft/Zero_Padding_Theorem_Spectral.html"">corresponds to interpolation in the Fourier domain</a>. It is frequently used in audio, for example for picking peaks in sinusoidal analysis.</p>

<p>While it doesn't increase the resolution, which really has to do with the <em>window shape</em> and length. As mentioned by @svenkatr, taking the transform of a signal that's not periodic in the DFT size is like multiplying with a <a href=""https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/sasp/Rectangular_Window.html"">rectangular window</a>, equivalent in turn to convolving it's spectrum with the transform of the rectangle function (a sinc), which has high energy in sidelobes (off-center frequencies), making the true sinusoidal peaks harder to find. This is known as spectral leakage.</p>

<p>But I disagree with @svenkatr that zero-padding is causing the rectangular windowing, they are separate issues. If you multiply your non-periodic signal by a suitable window (like the Hann or Hamming) that has appropriate length to have the frequency resolution that you need and then zero-pad for interpolation in frequency, things should work out just fine.</p>

<p>By the way, zero-padding is not the only interpolation method that can be used. For example, in estimating parameters of sinusoidal peaks (amplitude, phase, frequency) in the DFT, local quadratic interpolation (take 3 points around a peak and fit a parabola) can be  used because it is more computationally efficient than padding to the exact frequency resolution that you want (would mean a much larger DFT size).</p>

","<p>""Particularly, I had a hard time knowing why the (mod m) was off to the right and separate, and I am still not sure what the triple-lined equals symbol is all about.""</p>

<p>The notation $(57 \equiv 62) \pmod 5$ means $57$ and $62$ are congruent to each other modulo $5$, i.e. they both leave the same remainder on division by $5$.  See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic"" rel=""nofollow"">Modular arithmetic</a>.  That notation was introduced by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss"" rel=""nofollow"">Carl Friedrich Gauss</a> in his book <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disquisitiones_Arithmeticae"" rel=""nofollow"">Disquisitiones Arithmeticae</a> published in 1801, and has been standard since that time.</p>

<p>Later when computer programmers started doing modular arithmetic, they introduced a new notation: $57 \bmod 5$ means the remainder when $57$ is divided by $5$.</p>

<p>Just remember which notation is which and don't confuse them with each other.</p>

<p>The Wikipedia article might benefit from a concrete example or two.</p>

<p>Alright, suppose you want the inverse of $322$ when the modulus is the prime number $701$.  Since $701$ is prime, the gcd of $701$ and any number that is not a multiple of $701$ is $1$.  We will see that this implies there is a solution to the Diophantine equation $701x+322y=1$ (and if the gcd were something other than $1$, there would be a solution if instead of ""$=1$"" we put ""$=\text{whatever that other number is}$"").</p>

<p>So apply the Euclidean algorithm, but remember the quotients.  Divide 701 by $322$; get a quotient of $2$ and a remainder of $57$:
$$
701-2\cdot322 = [57].
$$
In Euclid's algorithm, we would next divide $322$ by $57$, getting a quotient of $5$ and a remainder of $37$:
$$
322 - 5\cdot [57] = [37].
$$
Then divide 57 by 37, getting a quotient of $1$ and a remainder of $20$:
$$
[57] - 1\cdot[37] = [20].
$$
Divide 37 by 20, getting a quotient of $1$ and a remainder of $17$:
$$
[37]-1\cdot[20] = [17].
$$
Divide $20$ by $17$, getting a quotient of 1 and a remainder of $3$:
$$
[20]-1\cdot[17]=[3].
$$
Divide $17$ by $3$, getting a quotient of $5$ and a remainder of $2$:
$$
[17]-5\cdot[3]=[2].
$$
Divide $3$ by $2$, getting a quotient of $1$ and a remainder of $1$:
$$
[3] -1\cdot[2]=[1].
$$
So according to Euclid's algorithm, the gcd is $1$, and if that is all we wanted, we'd have needed only the remainders and not the quotients.  But now we use the results above it solve $701x+322y=1$.  This will imply that $(322y\equiv1)\pmod {701}$, i.e. the multiplicative inverse of 322 is $y$, when the modulus is $701$.</p>

<p>I've put square brackets around the numbers found to be REMAINDERS but NOT around the QUOTIENTS.</p>

<p>In place of the remainder $2$, in the last line, put the expression found to be equal to $2$ in the line before it:
$$
\begin{align}
[3]-1\cdot[2] &amp; = [1] \\
{[}3{]}-1([17]-5\cdot[3]) &amp; = [1]
\end{align}
$$
Simplify, getting linear combination of REMAINDERS:
$$
6[3]-1[17] =1.
$$
Now in place of the remainder $3$, put the expression found to be equal to it:
$$
6([20]-1[17])-1[17] = 1.
$$
Simplify, getting linear combination of REMAINDERS:
$$
6[20]-7[17] = 1.
$$
Now in place of the remainder $17$, put the expression found to be equal to it:
$$
6[20] - 7([37]-1[20])=1.
$$
Simplify, getting linear combination of REMAINDERS:
$$
13[20]-7[37]=1.
$$
Now in place of the remainder $20$, put the expression found to be equal to it:
$$
13([57]-1[37])-7[37]=1.
$$
Simplify, getting linear combination of REMAINDERS:
$$
13[57]-20[37]=1.
$$
Now in place of the remainder $37$, put the expression found to be equal to it:
$$
13[57]-20(322-5[57])=1.
$$
Simplify, getting linear combination of REMAINDERS:
$$
113[57]-20[322]=1.
$$
Now in place of the remainder $57,$ put the expression found to be equal to it:
$$
113([701]-2[322])-20[322]=1.
$$
Simplify, getting linear combination of REMAINDERS:
$$
113[701]-246[322]=1.
$$

<p>It seems as though formerly $0$ was considered in the set of natural numbers, but now it seems more common to see definitions saying that the natural numbers are precisely the positive integers.  </p>
","<p>Simple answer: sometimes yes, sometimes no, it's usually stated (or implied by notation). From the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In mathematics, there are two

  definition; or the set of non-negative
  integers $\{0, 1, 2,\dots\}$ according to a
  definition first appearing in the

<p>Saying that, more often than not I've seen the natural numbers only representing the 'counting numbers' (i.e. excluding zero). This was the traditional historical definition, and makes more sense to me. Zero is in many ways the 'odd one out' - indeed, historically it was not discovered (described?) until some time after the natural numbers.</p>

","<p>Yes: multiplication distributes over products, so

<p>In the end, you should have a sum of products. Then you can just invert.</p>

<p>For example, if at the end you had
$$ p&#39; = a&#39;b + bc&#39; + d&#39;f&#39; + a&#39;f&#39;$$

Proceed by Gaussian elimination. The first multiplier is $\ell_{2,1}=4/8=0.5$
(this is the multiplier that allows us to cancel $a_{2,1}=4$ using
the first row) and the second is $\ell_{3,1}=0/8=0$.
We arrive at

To cancel out $a_{3,2}^{\left(1\right)}=5$, we use the multiplier
$\ell_{3,2}=5/8.5\approx0.5882$ to yield
$$
A^{\left(2\right)}\approx\left[\begin{array}{ccc}

"Combining two probability distributions","29536","","<p>I have a variable $X$. In a measurement $A$, $X$ follows the normal distribution $N_1$ with mean $m_1$ and standard deviation $\sigma_1$. In a similar measurement $B$, $X$ follows another normal distribution $N_2$ with mean $m_2$ and standard deviation $\sigma_2$. 
In this case, what will be the combined or joint probability distribution of $X$? Will it be $N_1+N_2$  or $N_1 N_2$ ? </p>

<p>(Addition) Let's assume $A$ and $B$ are independent measurements. We can think about a situation when a measurer $A$ comes and measure the distribution of $X$ and then next a person $B$ comes and measures the distribution again. Both measurers measure independently. 
The question is what will be the true probability distribution of $X$ in this case? We assume that the measurement of $A$ and $B$ are equally reliable. </p>

<p>(Paraphrasing a comment from r.e.s.)

"Derive Fourier transform of sinc function","29500","","<p>We know that the Fourier transform of the sinc function is the rectangular function (or top hat). However, I'm at a loss as to how to prove it. Most textbooks and online sources start with the rectangular function, show that </p>

<p>$$\int_{-\infty}^\infty \text{rect}(x)e^{i\omega x}dx=\int_{-1/2}^{1/2}e^{i\omega x}dx=\left.\frac{e^{i\omega x}}{i\omega}\right\vert_{-1/2}^{1/2}=\text{sinc}(\omega/2)$$</p>

<p>and then just invoke duality and claim that the Fourier transform of the sinc function is the rectangular function. Is there any way of deriving this directly? i.e., starting with the sinc function? </p>

<p>I've tried, but I'm not sure as to how to proceed. I know that the sinc is not Lebesgue integrable and only improper Riemann integrable. Some vague recollection of these being important in the Fourier transform hinders my thought process. Can someone clear things up for me?</p>
","<p>Since sinc is an entire function and decays with $1/\omega$, we can slightly shift the contour of integration in the inverse transform, and since there's no longer a singularity then, we can split the integral in two:</p>

<p>$$\begin{eqnarray}\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{i\omega x}\frac{e^{i\omega/2}-e^{-i\omega/2}}{i\omega}\mathrm{d}\omega
&amp;=&amp;
\int_{-\infty+\epsilon i}^{\infty+\epsilon i} e^{i\omega x}\frac{e^{i\omega/2}-e^{-i\omega/2}}{i\omega}\mathrm{d}\omega\\\

\int_{-\infty+\epsilon i}^{\infty+\epsilon i} e^{i\omega x}\frac{e^{i\omega/2}}{i\omega}\mathrm{d}\omega - 
\int_{-\infty+\epsilon i}^{\infty+\epsilon i} e^{i\omega x}\frac{e^{-i\omega/2}}{i\omega}\mathrm{d}\omega\;.
\end{eqnarray}$$</p>

<p>Now we can apply different substitutions to the two parts, $\omega&#39;=\omega(x+\frac{1}{2})$ in the first part and $\omega&#39;=\omega(x-\frac{1}{2})$ in the second part. That transforms the integrand into $e^{i\omega&#39;}/(i\omega&#39;)$ in both cases. Now if $x$ lies outside the rectangle, the signs of the factors in the substitutions are the same, so the two integrals stay on the same side of the origin and go in the same direction, and hence yield the same value and cancel to $0$. But if $x$ lies inside the rectangle, then there's a sign change due to $x-\frac{1}{2}$ but not due to $x+\frac{1}{2}$, so we get</p>

<p>$$\int_{-\infty+\epsilon i}^{\infty+\epsilon i} \frac{e^{i\omega&#39;}}{i\omega&#39;}\mathrm{d}\omega&#39; + 
\int_{\infty-\epsilon i}^{-\infty-\epsilon i} \frac{e^{i\omega&#39;}}{i\omega&#39;}\mathrm{d}\omega&#39;\;,$$</p>

"What does expected value of sum of two discrete random variables mean?","29432","","<p>I am confused with summing two random variables. Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are two random variables denoting how much is gained from each two games. If two games are played together, we can gain $E[X] + E[Y]$ in total. I understand until here. However, in many textbooks, the equation $E[X+Y]=E[X]+E[Y]$ is given as an explanation to expectation of playing two games together. Explanation is more difficult than the result.</p>

<p>What does $X+Y$ and $E[X+Y]$ mean? We define $E[X]=\sum X_ip_i$. So, do we define $E[X+Y]=\sum (X_i+Y_i)p_i$ where $p_i$ is the same for both random variables.</p>

<p>What if $X$ denotes the equally likely outcomes $1, 2, 3$ and $Y$ denotes the equally likely outcomes $1, 2, 3, 4, 5$?</p>
","<p>Good answers from @nrpeterson and @Lord_Farin.</p>

<p>For a practical demonstration consider an unbiased random number generator $i \in 6$, more commonly known as a dice.</p>

<p>Let $X$ be the result of throwing this dice once (an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_%28probability_theory%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">event</a>), and $Y$ be the result of a subsequent throw (another <em><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_%28probability_theory%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">independent</a></em> <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_%28probability_theory%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">event</a>).</p>

<p>If you consider the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_space"" rel=""noreferrer"">sample space</a> of each event they are the same and are:</p>

<p>$$\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
\text{Result} &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 \\ \hline

\end{array}$$</p>

<p>As you say, $E[X]=\sum X_ip_i$, so it is easy to show that $E(X)=E(Y)=3.5$. Please note that the expected value is not actually a result that is achievable; this is not uncommon. For what this <em>means</em> you are moving into philosophy rather than mathematics as discussed <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_interpretations"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>. Trivially $E(X)+E(Y)=7$</p>

<p>So what is $X+Y$? Clearly it is an integer $\in [2,12]$ but unlike $X$ and $Y$ not all outcomes are equally likely. Consider the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_probability"" rel=""noreferrer"">joint distribution</a> of $X+Y$:</p>

<p>$$\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} 
 &amp; X &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 \\ \hline
Y \\ \hline
1 &amp;  &amp; 2 &amp; 3&amp;4&amp;5&amp;6&amp;7 \\ \hline
2&amp;&amp;3&amp;4&amp;5&amp;6&amp;7&amp;8 \\ \hline
3&amp;&amp;4&amp;5&amp;6&amp;7&amp;8&amp;9 \\ \hline
4&amp;&amp;5&amp;6&amp;7&amp;8&amp;9&amp;10 \\ \hline
5&amp;&amp;6&amp;7&amp;8&amp;9&amp;10&amp;11 \\ \hline
6&amp;&amp;7&amp;8&amp;9&amp;10&amp;11&amp;12 \\ \hline
\end{array}$$</p>

<p>There are 36 possibilities that give rise to the 11 possible outcomes, the most common being 7 with $p=\frac{1}{6}$ and the least common being 2 and 12 with $p=\frac{1}{36}$. The expected value $E[X+Y]=\sum(X_i+Y_i)p_i$ can be calculated and is 7, so $E[X+Y]=E[X]+E[Y]$.</p>

$$i\omega \hat f(\omega) = -2i\hat f'(\omega).$$</p>

","<p>The fact that ordering does not matter <em>within</em> a group is already taken care of by the binomial coefficients. The additional $2!$ and $3!$ you see in the answer are taking care of the fact that the order in which the <em>groups themselves</em> were chosen also does not matter.</p>

<p>For example, if your two-person groups are $\{A, B\}$, $\{C, D\}$, and $\{E, F\}$, then the following arrangements are all the same:</p>

<p>$\{A, B\}$, $\{C, D\}$, $\{E, F\}$</p>

<p>Notice there are $3!$ such arrangements. When you just multiply your binomial coefficients together, however, these all get counted as distinct. Dividing by $3!$ collapses these all into a single arrangement.</p>

<p>To give another example with a better selection of numbers, suppose you want to arrange 6 people into three groups of two each. This would be given by
$$
\frac{\binom{6}{2} \binom{4}{2} \binom{2}{2}}{3!}.

Again, the $3!$ is coming from the <em>number</em> of groups, not their size.</p>

","<p>For very small numbers (less than a million), trial division is the best way: divide by 2, 3, 5, and so on until the square root of the number.  If you find a factor, the number is composite; otherwise, the number is prime.</p>

<p>For larger numbers there are better methods, but choosing which one depends on how much work you're willing to put into the program.  It is now known that there are no BPSW-pseudoprimes below $2^{64}$, so if you can write that test (see <a href=""http://www.trnicely.net/misc/bpsw.html"">here for details</a>) then you have a very quick test for primality.</p>

<p>If you only need to test up to $2^{32}$, you can simply check if the number is a 2-strong pseudoprime.  If so, test if it's one of 2314 exceptions (this can be done in 12 or 13 steps with a binary search); if the test fails or it's an exception, the number is composite, otherwise prime.  (You can go higher than $2^{32}$ if you're willing to build an appropriate table of exceptions.)</p>

<p>For larger numbers, the work is usually split into two parts: determining with high probability (say, 99.99999999%) that the number is prime, then actually proving that it is.  What type of proof depends on the form and size of the number.</p>

","<p>As you said, you want to show that for any $\epsilon&gt;0$ there is some $n_0\in\Bbb N$ such that $|a_m - a_n|&lt;\epsilon$ whenever $m, n \ge n_0$. The trick is to figure out how big an $n_0$ you’re going to need to make sure that $|a_m-a_m|&lt;\epsilon$ <strong>no matter how far apart</strong> $m$ and $n$, as long as they’re both at least $n_0$. Okay, suppose that we look at $|a_m-a_n|$ when $m$ and $n$ are not necessarily consecutive. There’s no harm in assuming that $m\le n$; then $k=n-m\ge 0$, and we’re looking at $|a_m-a_{m+k}|$. We only have a handle on the size of this number when $k=1$: if $k=1$, $|a_m-a_{m+k}|\le 2^{-m}$. But we also have the triangle inequality:</p>

<p>$$\begin{align*}
|a_m-a_{m+k}|&amp;=|(a_m-a_{m+1})+(a_{m+1}-a_{m+2})+\ldots+(a_{m+k-1}-a_{m+k})|\\
&amp;\le|a_m-a_{m+1}|+|a_{m+1}-a_{m+2}|+\ldots+|a_{m+k-1}-a_{m+k}|\\
&amp;&lt;2^{-m}+2^{-(m+1)}+\ldots+2^{-(m+k-1)}\\

&amp;=\frac{\frac1{2^m}}{1-\frac12}\\
&amp;=\frac1{2^{m-1}}\;.

<p>Thus, if $m,n\ge n_0$, we automatically have $|a_m-a_n|&lt;\dfrac1{2^{m-1}}\le\dfrac1{2^{n_0-1}}$. If we choose $n_0$ big enough so that $\dfrac1{2^{n_0-1}}\le\epsilon$, we’ll be in business. Is this always possible? Sure: just make sure that $2^{n_0-1}\ge\dfrac1\epsilon$, i.e., that $n_0\ge\log_2\dfrac2\epsilon$; this is certainly always possible.</p>

If $d_n$ is the number of labelled, connected, simple graphs on $n$ vertices, the numbers $d_n$ satisfy the recurrence</p>

<p>$$\sum_k\binom{n}kkd_k2^{\binom{n-k}2}=n2^\binom{n}2\;,$$</p>

<p>from which it’s possible to calculate $d_n$ for small values of $n$. This recurrence is derived as formula (3.10.2) in Herbert S. Wilf, <em>generatingfunctionology</em>, 2nd edition, which is available for free download <a href=""http://www.math.upenn.edu/~wilf/DownldGF.html"">here</a>.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConnectedGraph.html"">MathWorld</a>, Brendan McKay’s software package <code>nauty</code> includes a routine that efficiently enumerates such graphs; it’s available <a href=""http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/nauty/"">here</a>.</p>

"Find volume of region bound by $y=x, y=x^2$ around x-axis","28972","","<p>Here is the problem in my textbook: </p>

<p>Because equation $x = x^2$ has two roots : $0$ and $1$. we have:</p>

<p>For your problem, this is equivalent to rotating $R_2$ about the line $y=0$.</p>

<p>Since neither of the curves are touching the axis we are rotating about, we must use washers.</p>

<p>For washers, the volume is given by $$ V = \pi\int^b_a (R(x))^2-(r(x))^2 \ dx$$</p>

<p>Where $R(x)$ is the curve <em>farthest away</em> from our axis of rotation - the top function $y = x$ and $r(x)$ is the curve <em>closest</em> to the axis of rotation - the bottom function $y=x^2.$</p>

"Round table seating logic question.","28966","","<p>what is the probability of 5 people with different ages sitting in ascending or descending order at a round table. </p>

<p>So, let me know if there's a better way to go about this problem.</p>

<p>Let's have the people be named 1,2,3,4,5
They could sit:
12345
23451
34512
45123
51234
or the reverse since order matters (12345 is different from 54321)
There are 5! or 120 different ways the people can sit
So 10/120 or 1/12 is the chance that they sit in ascending or descending order. 
Is there a more formal way to do this?</p>

<p>Also, how many ways can 5 people sit at a round table? (combination problem, order doesn't matter)</p>
","<p>The answer to your second question will help illuminate a different way of thinking about the first.</p>

<p>If the $5$ people were to sit in a straight line, then the number of ways they can sit is indeed $5!$.  Since we are asking them to sit in a circle, each possible circular arrangement corresponds to $5$ different linear arrangements, depending on which seat we label the 'first' seat.  This shows that there are $5!/5=4!=24$ ways for $5$ people to sit around a table.</p>

<p>Now, of all $24$ possible seating arrangments, only $2$ of them are arranged in increasing or decreasing order of age, so the desired probability is $1/12$.</p>

<p>Notice our answers are the same, but it is important to see the distinction in our reasoning.  In a sense, you've chosen a first seat, which increased your numerator and denominator by a factor of $5$.  Since the question asks for a ratio, this didn't affect the final answer, but we should still note the difference between sitting around a table, and sitting in a line.</p>

","<p>I used a way to prove this, which I thought may not be the most concise way but it feels very intuitive to me.
The matrix $AB$ is actually a matrix that consist the linear combination of $A$ with $B$ the multipliers. So it looks like...
$$\boldsymbol{AB}=\begin{bmatrix}
 &amp;  &amp;  &amp; \\ 
a_1 &amp; a_2 &amp; ... &amp; a_n\\ 
 &amp;  &amp;  &amp; 
\end{bmatrix}

 &amp;  &amp;  &amp; \\ 
b_1 &amp; b_2 &amp; ... &amp; b_n\\ 
 &amp;  &amp;  &amp; 
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
 &amp;  &amp;  &amp; \\ 
\boldsymbol{A}b_1 &amp; \boldsymbol{A}b_2 &amp; ... &amp; \boldsymbol{A}b_n\\ 
 &amp;  &amp;  &amp; 
\end{bmatrix}$$
Suppose if $B$ is singular, then when $B$, being the multipliers of $A$, will naturally obtain another singular matrix of $AB$. Similarly, if $B$ is non-singular, then $AB$ will be non-singular. Therefore, the $rank(AB) \leq rank(B)$.</p>

<p>Then now if $A$ is singular, then clearly, no matter what $B$ is, the $rank(AB)\leq rank(A)$. The $rank(AB)$ is immediately capped by the rank of $A$ unless the the rank of $B$ is even smaller.</p>

<p>Put these two ideas together, the rank of $AB$ must have been capped the rank of $A$ or $B$, which ever is smaller. Therefore, $rank(AB) \leq min(rank(A), rank(B))$.</p>

"Is the void set (∅) a proper subset of every set?","28957","","<p>I am a bit confused about the concept of proper subsets,precisely whether to include one or both of the <strong>void set</strong> and <strong>the set itself</strong>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Obviously,every set is the subset of itself and the void set $\emptyset$ is the subset of every set. These two subsets are called improper subsets.</em></strong></p>

<p>Is this solution correct ? If so please explain the concept.</p>
","<p>Calling $\emptyset$ and $A$ ""improper"" subsets of a set $A$ is not universal, and it is confusing in this case, because the meaning of ""proper"" is not the same.  It is standard to say that $S$ is a proper subset of $A$ if (and only if) every element of $S$ is an element of $A$, but $S$ is not equal to $A$, i.e., at least one element of $A$ is not in $S$.  Under this definition, $\emptyset$ is a proper subset of every <em>nonempty</em> set, even though it is ""improper"" according to the convention you were also given.  Just remember that mathematical terminology varies and isn't always logical.  Here ""improper"" does not mean ""not proper"".

<p>But $(1, 0)$ rotated by $\theta$ degrees counterclockwise is just $(\cos \theta, \sin \theta)$, whereas $(0, 1)$ rotated by $\theta$ degrees counterclockwise is just $(-\sin \theta, \cos \theta)$.

<p>So take a rotation by $\theta$ and another one by $\theta'$, and multiply the corresponding matrices.  What you get is the sine and cosine angle addition formulas.  (The connection to complex numbers is that one can represent complex numbers as $2 \times 2$ real matrices.)</p>

"Finding formula for the nth partial sum","28832","","<p>A few days ago, I asked for some clarification about pattern recognition and the n-th partial sum for infinite series.  Although the explanation given was top-notch (thanks again), I'm still having difficulty with the homework.  The one I'm asking about tonight is the following sequence: $1 - 2 + 4 - 8 + ... + (-1)^{n-1}2^{n-1} + ...$</p>

s_4 = 1 -2 +4 -8 &amp; -5 &amp; ??\\
\end{array}

<p>As you can see from the question marks where suggested expressions might be, I'm struggling to find the pattern.  What I do know is the formula to compute $a_n$, but I haven't discerned the pattern for the n-th partial sum.  Because this is a power of 2 series, I see that the magnitude between the values of each sum is exactly the power of 2 for the next <em>n-1</em>.  That is, the distance between 1 and -1 is $2^1$ and the distance between -1 and 3 is $2^2$.  I think that within this is the key to figuring this out.  Nevertheless, the solution eludes me and I need a hint.</p>

<p>One of my attempts was $(-1)^{n-1}*2(\frac{1}{2^{n-1}})$ which worked for the first two partial sums but then fell apart miserably.  While typing this up, I just made the further discovery that starting with $s_2$ each partial sum is equal to $2^n - m$ where m is the same number twice.  I know that probably doesn't make sense but $s_2, s_3$ are both equal to $2^n - 5$ and $s_4, s_5$ are both $2^n - 21$.  The next two are $2^n - 85$.  That can't be coincidence.</p>

<p>Please, help me see what I'm missing or help me to understand how I should set this up to find the pattern for the n-th partial sum.</p>

<p>Thanks,
Andy</p>
","<p>Later data often show patterns better than early data, so extend your table of partial sums a bit:</p>

<p>$$\begin{array}{rcc}
n:&amp;1&amp;2&amp;3&amp;4&amp;5&amp;6&amp;7&amp;8&amp;9\\
s_n:&amp;1&amp;-1&amp;3&amp;-5&amp;11&amp;-21&amp;43&amp;-85&amp;171
\end{array}$$</p>

<p>Ignoring the signs, it appears that the numbers in the bottom line are approximately doubling each time. Moreover, still ignoring signs, adjacent partial sums add up to a power of $2$: $|s_1|+|s_2|=2^1$, $|s_2|+|s_3|=2^2$, $|s_3|+|s_4|=2^3$, and apparently in general $|s_n|+|s_{n+1}|=2^n$. (If you go back to the definition of the partial sums, you’ll see why this happens.)</p>

<p>If $|s_n|+|s_{n+1}|=2^n$ and $|s_{n+1}|\approx 2|s_n|$, then $3|s_n|\approx 2^n$; this suggests that we should compare $3|s_n|$ with $2^n$:</p>

<p>$$\begin{array}{rcc}
n:&amp;1&amp;2&amp;3&amp;4&amp;5&amp;6&amp;7&amp;8&amp;9\\

2^n:&amp;2&amp;4&amp;8&amp;16&amp;32&amp;64&amp;128&amp;256&amp;512
\end{array}$$</p>

<p>That pattern’s pretty clear: apparently $3|s_n|=2^n+1$ if $n$ is odd, and $3|s_n|=2^n-1$ if $n$ is even. Those cases can be combined as $3|s_n|=2^n+(-1)^{n+1}$, since $(-1)^{n+1}$ is $1$ when $n$ is odd and $-1$ when $n$ is even. And the algebraic sign of $s_n$ appears to be that of $(-1)^{n+1}$, so if these patterns are real,</p>

<p>$$\begin{align*}
s_n&amp;=\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}3\left(2^n+(-1)^{n+1}\right)\\
&amp;=\frac{(-1)^{n+1}2^n}3+\frac{(-1)^{2n+2}}3\\
&amp;=\frac{(-1)^{n+1}2^n+1}3\\
&amp;=\frac{1-(-2)^n}3\;.
\end{align*}$$</p>

<p>This result can then be proved by mathematical induction, but I suspect that you’re not expected to go that far.</p>

<p>If you’ve already learned the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_series#Formula"" rel=""nofollow"">summation formula for finite geometric series</a>, you can apply it to get $s_n$ without looking at any patterns at all, and it’s something that you should learn as soon as possible if you don’t already know it. However, skill at pattern-recognition is useful anyway, so I thought that it might be useful to see how the problem can be attacked in that way as well.</p>

"Odds of winning at minesweeper with perfect play","28780","","<p>How would someone go about doing this? Assume that the first ""click"" will never be a bomb, and that the number of mines and the area are both known. Rather hoping there is a clever way to do this, but I will not be so surprised if there isn't.</p>

<p>EDIT:
I would assume (though without any real proof) that a program could be written that could solve minesweeper in linear time (as the board gets bigger linearly, if the mines/area ratio stays the same).</p>

<p>It would seem to me that in general no more than 9 blocks need to be considered (the high end of what i've see playing minesweeper at expert) to determine if</p>

<li>its a mine</li>
<li>its a safe square</li>
<li>the odds that its a mine</li>

<p>EDIT 2: This would also seem to contradict the fact that minesweeper is NP complete, and with probably not so much work one (maybe even I, but probably not) could write an algorithm that can play a perfect game of minesweeper that would have a linearly increasing runtime which would contradict (summery of) the paper <a href=""http://web.mat.bham.ac.uk/R.W.Kaye/minesw/ordmsw.htm"">here</a>. So I guess this raises the next question which is: where is the flaw in my logic?</p>

<p>EDIT 3: I really am more interesting in the odds than in the algorithm to solve minesweeper. And it would be helpful to me if someone could explain why the number of checks/tests/calculations one has to do does not rise linearly with respect to area.</p>
","<p>I am a very good minesweeper player, and I can say that perfect play can get you to win in $99\%$ of the easy ($8\times 8$ with $10 $mines) or intermediate ($16 \times 16$ with $40$ mines) levels. In the expert level ($16 \times 30$ with $99$ mines) it becomes harder to win without making any guesses.</p>

<p>About first click not being a mine, this is obvious, since the mine positions should be generated after your first click, and I think this is the case in the known minesweeper games. </p>

<p>Although, perfect play is not enough, if the distribution of mines is completely random. For instance, I encountered many times the following configuration in a corner of the board
$\begin{matrix} \square&amp; X &amp; M \\ M &amp; M &amp; M \end{matrix}$, where $\square$ is free square, $M$ is a marked mine, and $X$ is an unknown mine. Imagine this configuration in the upper left corner of the table, and the counter says that there is only $1$ mine left. You would have to guess and have only $50\%$ chances of winning, since there is no clue as to where the mine is.</p>

<p>About implementing an algorithm of solving minesweeper games with perfect play, there are some things you should consider, since some of the mines are not always obvious to find. I have in mind a few steps when I solve minesweeper games:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>first mark the obvious mines;</p></li>
<li><p>open the safe squares;</p></li>
<li><p>look for some patterns learned before (e.g. $1-2-1$ or $1-2-2-1$);</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If at one point, none of these steps can be applied, you can only guess the next step. Considering probabilities, is not very conclusive, since the values would be relatively close to $50\%$.</p>

<p>Did the person that wrote the solution simplify something? It does not look like either of these two forms. </p>

<p>Also, for problems like these, is there a general rule on when to use Bayes' Theorem and the rule for Total Probability? I cannot figure out when to use what.</p>
","<p>The law of total probability is used <em>in</em> Bayes theorem:</p>

<p>$P(A|B)=\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)} \implies P(A\cap B) = P(B)P(A|B).$ This is just the definition of conditional probability.</p>

<p>Now, the Law of Total Probabiliyy can be used to calculate $P(B)$ in the above definition. The law requires that you have a set of <em>disjoint</em> events $D_i$ that collectively ""cover"" the event $B$. Then, instead of calculating $P(B)$ directly, you add up the intersection of $B$ with each of the events $E_i$:</p>

<p>$P(B)=\sum P(B\cap E_i)$ Of course, we can rewrite this using the definition of conditional probability:</p>

<p>$P(B)=\sum P(B\cap E_i)=\sum P(E_i)P(B|E_i)$</p>

"How to choose between poisson and binomial distributions","28596","","<p>I don't get this thing... I know that binomial distribution is used to know the probability of a X v.a. that sounds like this: X = ""the probability of having 4 blue balls doing 10 extraction from a chest containing 7 blue and 40 white"", and I know that poisson distribution and binomial distribution are really similar for lim_(p*n)->0(F(x)) (when p*n are really small...). I'm reading everywhere that the distribution of poisson is used a lot to approximate a big binomial... but what's its real purpose? what's the cases in wich I must use poisson and not binomial? (beyond the approximation case).</p>

<p>thanks in advance.</p>
","<p>The Poisson distribution is also called the ""law of rare events"" -- it is the distribution that counts the number of occurrences of an event given that the probability of the event is very small.</p>

<p>That should sound a lot like the binomial distribution.  In fact, the Poisson distribution can be derived as a limit of the binomial distribution.</p>

<p>So what is the point of it?  First, the fact that the limit exists gives us a lot of analytically useful results.  The Poisson distribution is easier to work with than the binomial distribution.  It is easier to compute the pdf and especially the cdf.  Its generating functions have nice properties.  Etc.</p>

<p>Second, in applications, the Poisson distribution serves in ways that the binomial distribution just cannot handle.  Consider the case of radioactive decay.  You're measuring the rate, using a Geiger counter, on a sample of hundreds of trillions of atoms.  The binomial distribution is arguably applicable in this case, but are we really sure that atoms are ""discrete"" in the same way the integers are?  (That is an empirical question, up to science to figure out)  I would argue that without a priori knowledge, using the Poisson approximation is <em>not</em> an approximation of the binomial distribution.  It is an approximation of the ""real"" behavior of radioactive decay, whatever that is.</p>

"Second derivative ""formula derivation""","28576","","<p>I've been trying to understand how the second order derivative ""formula"" works:</p>

<p>$$\lim_{h\to0} \frac{f(x+h) - 2f(x) + f(x-h)}{h^2}$$</p>

<p>So, the rate of change of the rate of change for an arbitrary continuous function. It basically feels right, since it samples ""the after $x+h$ and the before $x-h$"" and the $h^2$ is there (due to the expected /h/h -> /h*h), but I'm having trouble finding the equation on my own.</p>

<p>It's is basically a derivative of a derivative, right? Newtonian notation declares as $f''$ and Leibniz's as $\frac{\partial^2{y}}{\partial{x}^2}$ which dissolves into:</p>

<p>$$(f')'$$ and
$$\frac{\partial{}}{\partial{x}}\frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{x}}$$</p>

<p>So, first derivation shows the rate of change of a function's value relative to input. The second derivative shows the rate of change of the actual rate of change, suggesting information relating to how frequenly it changes.</p>

<p>The original one is rather straightforward:</p>

<p>$$\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \lim_{h\to0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{x + h - x} = \lim_{h\to0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$$</p>

<p>And can easily be shown that $f'(x) = nx^{n-1} + \dots$ is correct for the more forthcoming of polynomial functions.

I'll drop the $\lim_{h\to0}$ for simplicity:</p>

<p>$$f'(x) = \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$$</p>

","<p>When a polynomial is integer valued, one may appeal to Gauss's lemma which states that if the coefficients of a non-constant polynomial $f$ are relatively prime and $f$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Z}[X],$ then $f$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Q}[X].$ </p>

<p>This allows you to use the structure of $\mathbb{Z}[X]$ which is richer than that of $\mathbb{Q}[X]$ to prove irreducibility.

<p>If $f$ is the density function of the distribution of a random variable $X$, then
$$
\E(g(x)) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty g(x)f(x)\,dx,
$$
and there's no need to find the probability distribution, including the density, of the distribution of the random variable $g(X)$.</p>

<p>Now let $X=\mu+\sigma Z$ where $Z$ is a <em>standard</em> normal, i.e. $\E(Z)=0$ and $\operatorname{var}(Z)=1$.</p>

<p>Then you get
$$
\begin{align}
\E(e^X) &amp; =\E(e^{\mu+\sigma Z}) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{\mu+\sigma z} \varphi(z)\,dz \\[10pt]

\end{align}
$$</p>

<p>We have $\sigma z-\dfrac{z^2}{2}$ so of course we complete the square:
$$
\frac 1 2 \left( z^2 - 2\sigma z \right) = \frac 1 2 \left( z^2 - 2\sigma z + \sigma^2\right) - \frac 1 2 \sigma^2 = \frac 1 2 \left( z-\sigma \right)^2 - \frac 1 2 \sigma^2.
$$
Then the integral is
$$
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{\mu+ \sigma^2/2} \int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-(z-\sigma)^2/2}\,dz
$$
This whole thing is
$$
e^{\mu + \sigma^2/2}.
$$
In other words, the integral with $z+\sigma$ is the same as that with just $z$ in that place, because the function is merely moved over by a distance $\sigma$.  If you like, you can say $w=z+\sigma$ and $dw=dz$, and as $z$ goes from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$, so does $w$, so you get the <em>same</em> integral after this substitution.</p>

Corresponding to each placement, we can define a subset of $A$ by taking the elements placed in box 1 and discarding the elements placed in box 2.

","<p>You are confusing some things here. The argument given is the <em>total</em> number of subsets for a set of $n$ elements. Combinations, on the other hand, count the number of subsets of a <em>given size</em>.</p>

<p>For example, consider the set $\{1,\ 2,\ 3\}$. There are $2^3=8$ total subsets (of <em>all sizes</em>), which are
$$\left\{\emptyset,\ \{1\},\ \{2\},\ \{3\},\ \{1,\ 2\},\ \{1,\ 3\},\ \{2,\ 3\},\ \{1,\ 2,\ 3\}\right\}$$
The subsets are symmetric in inclusion/exclusion (and this is why you only have two boxes: the first box represents inclusion and the second exclusion), for example the set $\{2\}$ has a complement, namely $\{1,\ 3\}$ where the first set is obtained by <em>keeping</em> $2$ while the second set is obtained by <em>throwing away</em> $2$.</p>

<p>Combinations count the subsets of a particular <em>size</em> ($n$ choose $r$ counts the number of $r$-element subsets of an $n$-element set). In our running example consider how many subsets of size $2$ there are:
$$\left\{\{1,\ 2\},\ \{1,\ 3\},\ \{2,\ 3\}\right\}$$
for a total of $\binom{3}{2}$. The symmetry noted from before is also reflected in the fact that the binomial coefficients are symmetric 
$$\binom{n}{r} = \binom{n}{n-r}$$
which represents the fact that for every $r$-element subset that you keep, there's  corresponding $n-r$-element subset that you've thrown away.</p>

<p>Of course the two concepts are intimately related. The total number of subsets is the sum of the number of subsets of every size.
$$2^n = \sum_{r=0}^n\binom{n}{r}$$

","<p>The continuity correction comes up most often when we are using the normal approximation to the binomial. It comes up sometimes when we are approximating a Poisson distribution with large $\lambda$ by a normal. </p>

<p>Suppose that $npq$ is not too small. Then if $k$ is an <strong>integer</strong>, $\Pr(X\le k)$ is reasonably well-approximated by $\Pr(Y\le k)$. It is ordinarily <strong>better</strong> approximated by $\Pr(Y\le k+\frac{1}{2})$. The difference can be significant when $n$ is not large. When $np(1-p)$ is big, say bigger than $100$, the continuity correction makes little practical difference.</p>

<p>The continuity correction is less important than it used to be. For with modern software, we can compute $\Pr(X\le k)$ essentially exactly. </p>

<p>It is easy to get confused when using the continuity correction. In particular, the question that you asked comes up: when do we <strong>add</strong> $\frac{1}{2}$, and when do we subtract? I deal with that by remembering only one rule. To repeat,</p>

<p><strong>Rule:</strong> If $k$ is an integer, then $\Pr(X\le k)\approx \Pr(Y\le k+\frac{1}{2})$, where $Y$ is a normal with the same mean and variance as $X$.</p>

This <strong>doesn't</strong> quite look like our Rule. Note we have $\lt k$, not $\le k$. But $X\lt k$ if and only if $X\le k-1$. Now we are of the right shape. The answer is, approximately, $\Pr(Y\le (k-1+\frac{1}{2}$, where $Y$ is the appropriate normal.
This is $\Pr(Y\le k-\frac{1}{2}$, so in a sense we sutracted. But it all came from the one Rule, where we always add, but pay close attention to the difference between $\lt$ and $\le$. </p>

<p>What is the probability that $X\gt k$? This is $1-\Pr(X\le k)$. Thus we get that the result is approximately $1-\Pr(Y\le k+\frac{1}{2})$. </p>

<p><strong>A numerical example:</strong> Toss a fair coin $100$ times. Approximate the probability that the number of heads is $\le 55$.</p>

<p>By working directly with the binomial, and software, I get this is, to $6$ figures, $0.864373$. That's the ""right"" answer. </p>

<p>Using $\Pr(Y\le 55)$, where $Y$ is normal mean $50$, standard deviation $5$, no continuity correction, I get the approximation $0.8413$.</p>

<p>Using the continuity correction, I get the approximation $0.8643$. I should really do a few other examples, the continuity correction is <strong>too</strong> good here!</p>

"Difference between continuity and uniform continuity","28225","","<p>I understand the geometric differences between continuity and uniform continuity, but I don't quite see how the differences between those two are apparent from their definitions. For example, my book defines continuity as:</p>

<p><strong>Definition 4.3.1.</strong> A function $f:A \to \mathbb R$ is <em>continuous at a point</em> $c \in A$ if, for all $\epsilon &gt; 0$, there exists a $\delta &gt; 0$ such that whenever $|x-c| &lt; \delta$ (and $x \in A$) it follows that $|f(x)-f(c)| &lt; \epsilon$.</p>

<p>Uniform continuity is defined as:</p>

<p><strong>Definition 4.4.5.</strong> A function $f:A \to \mathbb R$ is <em>uniformly continuous</em> on $A$ if for every $\epsilon &gt; 0$ there exists a $\delta &gt; 0$ such that $|x-y| &lt; \delta$ implies $|f(x)-f(y)| &lt; \epsilon$.</p>

<p>I know that in Definition 4.3.1, $\delta$ can depend on $c$, while in definition 4.4.5, $\delta$ cannot depend on $x$ or $y$, but how is this apparent from the definition? From what appears to me, it just seems like the only difference between Definition 4.3.1 and Definition 4.4.5 is that the letter $c$ was changed to a $y$. </p>

<p>My guess is that the first definition treats $c$ as a fixed point and it is only $x$ that varies, so in this case, $\delta$ can depend on $c$ since $c$ doesn't change. Whereas for the second definition, neither $x$ or $y$ are fixed, rather they can take on values across the whole domain, $A$. In this case, if we set a $\delta$ such that it depended on $y$, then when we pick a different $y$, the same $\delta$ may not work anymore. Is this somewhat a correct interpretation?</p>

<p>Anymore clarifications, examples, would be appreciated.</p>
","<p>First of all, continuity is defined at a point $c$, whereas uniform continuity is defined on a set $A$. That makes a big difference.
But your interpretation is rather correct: the point $c$ is part of the data, and is kept fixed as, for instance, $f$ itself. Roughly speaking, uniform continuity requires the existence of a <em>single</em> $\delta&gt;0$ that works for the whole set $A$, and not near the single point $c$.</p>

"Are the rationals a closed or open set in $\mathbb{R}$?","28224","","<p>I have a feeling they are neither closed nor open as the $\mathbb{R} \backslash \mathbb{Q}$ cannot be open or closed either...</p>
","<p>In the <em>usual topology</em> of $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{Q}$ is neither open nor closed.</p>

<p>The interior of $\mathbb{Q}$ is empty (any nonempty interval contains irrationals, so no nonempty open set can be contained in $\mathbb{Q}$). Since $\mathbb{Q}$ does not equal its interior, $\mathbb{Q}$ is not open.</p>

<p>The closure of $\mathbb{Q}$ is all of $\mathbb{R}$: every real number is the limit of a sequence of rationals, so every real number lies in the closure of $\mathbb{Q}$. Since $\mathbb{Q}$ does not equal its closure, it is not closed.</p>

<h3>Research</h3>

<p>Integrating a sine wave function is indeed easy, but things gets a lot complicated when it comes to other waveforms. Here follow the equations I'm using to display the waveforms:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Sawtooth wave:</p>

<p>$ f(x) = \bmod(f_c x, 1.0); $</p></li>
<li><p>Square wave: </p>

<li><p>Triangle wave:</p>

</ul>

<p>These functions <em>looks</em> right, but as I don't have any particular background in mathematics or calculus I won't be surprised if I made some bad mistakes. Please be patient.</p>

<h3>Updates</h3>

<p>Thanks to the the functions with period $T$ in the form <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/178079/integration-of-sawtooth-square-and-triangle-wave-functions#answer-178239"">Rahul</a> suggested I get:</p>

","<p>Well, in principle there's nothing wrong with the definitions you have. Mathematically, functions are defined <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensionality"">extensionally</a>, so two different-looking functions that have the same output on all inputs are actually the same function, just written in different forms.</p>

<p>That said, when dealing with custom user-specified functions that are periodic, I think it's easier to define them on an interval spanning one period, and then extend them to the rest of the real line using periodicity. That is, you define $g\colon [0,T)\to\mathbb R$ whatever way you like, where $T$ is the period of your waveform, and then let $f(x) = g(x\bmod T)$ for any $x\in\mathbb R$. For your examples, I'd define
$$\begin{align}
g_{\text{sawtooth}}(x) &amp;= \frac{2x}T-1, \\
g_{\text{square}}(x) &amp;= \begin{cases}1&amp;\text{if } x&lt;T/2,\\-1&amp;\text{if }x\ge T/2,\end{cases}\\
g_{\text{triangle}}(x) &amp;= \begin{cases}\frac{4x}T-1&amp;\text{if } x&lt;T/2,\\3-\frac{4x}T&amp;\text{if }x\ge T/2.\end{cases}
\end{align}$$
These are slightly different from the ones in your question. They all have amplitude $1$ and mean $0$, and the square and triangle waves behave sort of like $\sin$ and $-\cos$ respectively.</p>

<p>Now you want to integrate these. There's a nice way to integrate a periodic function, by breaking the interval of integration into periods:
$$\begin{align}
\int_0^xf(t)\,\mathrm dt &amp;= \int_0^Tf(t)\,\mathrm dt+\int_T^{2T}f(t)\,\mathrm dt+\cdots+\int_{(n-1)T}^{nT}f(t)\,\mathrm dt+\int_{nT}^xf(t)\,\mathrm dt \\
&amp;= n\int_0^Tf(t)\,\mathrm dt+\int_0^{x-nT}f(t)\,\mathrm dt.
\end{align}$$
If you pick $n=\lfloor x/T\rfloor$, and use the fact that $f(t)=g(t)$ when $t\in[0,T)$, this becomes
$$\int_0^xf(t)\,\mathrm dt=nT\bar g+\int_0^{x\bmod T}g(t)\,\mathrm dt,$$
where $\bar g$ is the mean value of $g$ over $[0,T)$. (This is one reason why I made it zero in the above examples, so this term drops out.) So all you really need to find analytically is the indefinite integral of $g$ over $[0,T)$. I imagine you can do that, especially with the simple definitions above.</p>

<p>Can you please explain the basic difference between the two of them ? </p>

<p>Thanks ,Ron</p>
","<p>In brief:</p>

<p>Soundness means that you <em>cannot</em> prove anything that's wrong.</p>

<p>Completeness means that you <em>can</em> prove anything that's right.</p>

<p>In both cases, we are talking about a some fixed system of rules for proof (the one used to define the relation $\vdash$ ).</p>

<p>In more detail: Think of $\Sigma$ as a set of hypotheses, and $\Phi$ as a statement we are trying to prove.  When we say $\Sigma \models \Phi$, we are saying that $\Sigma$ <em>logically implies</em> $\Phi$, i.e., in every circumstance in which $\Sigma$ is true, then $\Phi$ is true.  Informally, $\Phi$ is ""right"" given $\Sigma$.</p>

<p>When we say $\Sigma \vdash \Phi$, on the other hand, we must have some set of rules of proof (sometimes called ""inference rules"") in mind.  Usually these rules have the form, ""if you start with some particular statements, then you can derive these other statements"".  If you can derive $\Phi$ starting from $\Sigma$, then we say that $\Sigma \vdash \Phi$, or that $\Phi$ is provable from $\Sigma$.  </p>

<p>We are thinking of a proof as something used to convince others, so it's important that the rules for $\vdash$ are mechanical enough so that another person or a computer can <em>check</em> a purported proof (this is different from saying that the other person/computer could <em>create</em> the proof, which we do <em>not</em> require).</p>

<p>Soundness states: $\Sigma \vdash \Phi$  implies $\Sigma \models \Phi$. If you can prove $\Phi$ from $\Sigma$, then $\Phi$ is true given $\Sigma$.  Put differently, if $\Phi$ is not true (given $\Sigma$), then you can't prove $\Phi$ from $\Sigma$.  Informally: ""You can't prove anything that's wrong.""</p>

<p>Completeness states: $\Sigma \models \Phi$ imples $\Sigma \vdash \Phi$.  If $\Phi$ is true given $\Sigma$, then you can prove $\Phi$ from $\Sigma$.  Informally: ""You can prove anything that's right.""</p>

As <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_independence"">the Wikipedia article</a> puts it, ""$R$ and $B$ are conditionally independent [given $Y$] if and only if, given knowledge of whether $Y$ occurs, knowledge of whether $R$ occurs provides no information on the likelihood of $B$ occurring, and knowledge of whether $B$ occurs provides no information on the likehood of $R$ occurring"". In this case, $R$ and $B$ are the events of persons <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> getting home in time for dinner, and $Y$ is the event of a snow storm hitting the city. Certainly the probabilities of $R$ and $B$ will depend on whether $Y$ occurs. However, just as it's plausible to assume that if these two people have nothing to do with each other their probabilities of getting home in time are independent, it's also plausible to assume that, while they will both have a lower probability of getting home in time if a snow storm hits, these lower probabilities will nevertheless still be independent of each other. That is, if you already know that a snow storm is raging and I tell you that person <strong>A</strong> is getting home late, that gives you no new information about whether person <strong>B</strong> is getting home late. You're getting information on that from the fact that there's a snow storm, but given that fact, the fact that <strong>A</strong> is getting home late doesn't make it more or less likely that <strong>B</strong> is getting home late, too. So conditional independence is the same as normal independence, but restricted to the case where you know that a certain condition is or isn't fulfilled. Not only can you not find out about <strong>A</strong> by finding out about <strong>B</strong> in general (normal independence), but you also can't do so under the condition that there's a snow storm (conditional independence).</p>

<p>An example of events that are independent but not conditionally independent would be: You randomly sample two people <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> from a large population and consider the probabilities that they will get home in time. Without any further knowledge, you might plausibly assume that these probabilities are independent. Now you introduce event $Y$, which occurs if the two people live in the same neighbourhood (however that might be defined). If you know that $Y$ occurred and I tell you that <strong>A</strong> is getting home late, then that would tend to increase the probability that <strong>B</strong> is also getting home late, since they live in the same neighbourhood and any traffic-related causes of <strong>A</strong> getting home late might also delay <strong>B</strong>. So in this case the probabilities of <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> getting home in time are not conditionally independent given $Y$, since once you know that $Y$ occurred, you are able to gain information about the probability of <strong>B</strong> getting home in time by finding out whether <strong>A</strong> is getting home in time.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, this scenario only works if there's always the same amount of traffic delay in the city overall and it just moves to different neighbourhoods. If that's not the case, then it wouldn't be correct to assume independence between the two probabilities, since the fact that one of the two is getting home late would already make it somewhat likelier that there's heavy traffic in the city in general, even without knowing that they live in the same neighbourhood.</p>

<p>To give a precise example: Say you roll a blue die and a red die. The two results are independent of each other. Now you tell me that the blue result isn't a $6$ and the red result isn't a $1$. You've given me new information, but that hasn't affected the independence of the results. By taking a look at the blue die, I can't gain any knowledge about the red die; after I look at the blue die I will still have a probability of $1/5$ for each number on the red die except $1$. So the probabilities for the results are conditionally independent given the information you've given me. But if instead you tell me that the sum of the two results is even, this allows me to learn a lot about the red die by looking at the blue die. For instance, if I see a $3$ on the blue die, the red die can only be $1$, $3$ or $5$. So in this case the probabilities for the results are not conditionally independent given this other information that you've given me. This also underscores that conditional independence is always relative to the given condition -- in this case, the results of the dice rolls are conditionally independent with respect to the event ""the blue result is not $6$ and the red result is not $1$"", but they're not conditionally independent with respect to the event ""the sum of the results is even"".</p>

\begin{align}
E(Y) &amp;= E\left(X_1(X_2)^3\right)\\
    &amp; = E(X_1)  E(X_2^2)

","<p>The proposed start will not work: $X_1$ and $X_2^3$ are not independent.</p>

<p>I would suggest first making a name change, $X$ for $X_1$, $Y$ for $X_2$, and $W$ for $XY^3$.  You need to calculate the expectation $E(W)$ of the random variable $W$. </p>

<p>Call the joint density $8xy$ over the region with $0\lt x\lt y\lt 1$.</p>

<p>Now draw a picture (this was the whole purpose of the name changes). The region where the density function is $8xy$ is the part of the square with corners $(0,0)$, $(0,1)$, $(1,1)$, and $(0,1)$ which is <strong>above</strong> the line $y=x$. (The density is $0$ everywhere else.) </p>

<p>The region where the density is $8xy$ is a triangle. Call it $T$. Then 
$$E(W)=E(XY^3)=\iint_{T} (xy^3)(8xy)\,dx\,dy.$$</p>

"Probability of winning a best of 3 out of 5 game","28039","","<p>Two people play a series of independent games. Person 1's probability of winning any game is 0.6, which leaves 0.4 for Person 2. If they play a best of 5 tournament (3/5), find the following. </p>

<p>I was thinking that for (1) it would be (3/5)*(3/5) -- Person1's probability of winning times the best of 5 wins. Is that even on the right track? </p>

<p>And how would you start the others?</p>
","<p>$1.$ This is easy, the fact you didn't answer it correctly is probably due to not understanding the question. Person $1$, let's call her Alice, wins the tournament in $3$ games if she wins Games $1$, $2$, and $3$. We are assuming independence, so the probability is $(0.6)^3$.</p>

<p>$2.$ The tournament lasts exactly $3$ games if Alice wins Games $1$, $2$, and $3$, or Betty does. The probability Betty does is $(0.4)^3$, so our required probability is $(0.6)^3+(0.4)^3$.   </p>

<p>$3.$ This is more complicated. The tournament lasts exactly $4$ games if (i) Alice wins the $4$th game, and exactly $2$ of the other $3$ or (ii) Betty wins the $4$th game, and exactly $2$ of the other $3$. </p>

<p>For (i), winning $2$ of the first $3$ can happen in the patterns WWL, WLW, and LWW. Each of these has probability $(0.6)^2(0.4)$. Multiply by $3$ because of the $3$ different ways. We get $3(0.6)^2(0.4)$. Multiply by the probability Alice wins the $4$th game. We get $3(0.6)^3(0.4)$.</p>

<p>We get a similar expression for (ii), reversing the roles of $0.6$ and $0.4$. Add: we get
$$3(0.6)^3(0.4)+3(0.4)^3(0.6).$$</p>

<p>$4.$ This is a sum of the probabilities that Alice wins in $3$, in $4$, and in $5$. We already know the answers to the first two: $(0.6)^3$ and $3(0.6)^3(0.4)$ respectively. I will leave to you to find the probability Alice wins in $5$. <strong>Hint:</strong> She has to win the $5$th game, and <em>exactly</em> $2$ of the first $4$.</p>

<p>$5.$ <strong>Hint:</strong> It has something to do with the answers to $1$ and $4$. The key word is conditional probability. </p>

<p>In symbols, let $A$ be the event ""Tournament lasts $3$ games"" and
$B$ the event ""Alice wins tournament."" We want $\Pr(A|B)$.</p>

<p>$6.$ Again, a conditional probability. </p>

<p>After you have worked on the problems for a while, perhaps I can add to the hints. Would need to know what you have been exposed to about conditional probability.</p>

<p><strong>Remark:</strong> In case you are not familiar with the tournament setup, here is an explanation of how it works. <strong>As soon as</strong> one person has won $3$ games, the tournament is over. So the tournament can last $3$, $4$, or $5$ games. If some person wins Games $1$, $2$, and $3$, the tournament is over, no more games are played.  </p>

"Finding poles, indicating their order and then computing their residues","28021","","<p>I really don't understand the concept behind finding poles in Complex Analysis and I can't find anything on the internet or in books that helps me grasp the concept...</p>

<p>The following are past exam questions that I'm looking at but don't know where to go with with them in order to find their poles, indicate their order to then compute their residues.. Any help would be greatly appreciated...</p>

<p>$(i) f(z)=\dfrac{\sin z }{(z-1)\sinh z}$</p>

<p>$(ii)g(z)= \dfrac{\sin z}{z(z^2+4)}$</p>
","<p>The general, intuitive idea of poles is that they are points where evaluating your function would entail dividing by zero. The order of the pole is the exponent in the factor that is going to zero in the denominator. It's best to start with some simple examples, such as rational functions:</p>

<p>$$ f(z) = \frac{(z + 1)(z - 2)}{(z + 1)(z - 1)(z-3)^2}$$</p>

<p>Notice that the denominator goes to zero at $z = -1, 1, 3$. For $z = -1$, however, there's also a copy of $(z + 1)$ on the top, so this is a pole of order zero, or a <em>removable singularity</em>, so it normally doesn't count. At $z = 1$, we have one copy of $(z - 1)$ in the denominator, so it's a pole of order $1$. For $z = 3$, we have $(z - 3)$ with multiplicity $2$, so it's a pole of order $2$.</p>

<p>Now let's look at a slightly more interesting example:</p>

<p>$$f(z) = \frac{z}{ \sin{z}}$$</p>

<p>As we all know, $\sin(z) = 0$ when $z = n \pi$, where $n$ is an integer, and furthermore, all these zeros of $\sin(z)$ are single roots, so naturally we might think that $f(z)$ has poles of order $1$ at $z = n \pi$ for every $n$. However, the $z$ in the numerator cancels out the zero at $z = 0$ in the denominator, so in fact $f(z)$ in this case has a pole of order $1$ for $z = n \pi$, where $n$ is a nonzero integer.</p>

<p>So the general strategy can be described as this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Identify all the zeros in the denominator, along with their multiplicities.</li>
<li>Identify any zeros in the numerator that are also zeros in the denominator, along with their multiplicities.</li>
<li>Each zero in the denominator is a pole whose order is given by taking the multiplicity in the denominator and subtracting away the multiplicity in the numerator. If the order isn't positive, then it actually isn't a pole.</li>

","<p>I don't know, let's find out.  Maybe the median is in the $[0,5]$ part. Maybe it is in the other part. To get some insight, let's find the probability that our random variable lands between $0$ and $5$. This is
$$\int_0^5(0.04)x\,dx.$$
Integrate. We get $0.5$. What a lucky break! There is nothing more to do. The median is $5$.</p>

<p>Well, it wasn't entirely luck. <strong>Graph</strong> the density function. (We should have done that to begin with, geometric insight can never hurt.) We find that the density function is  <strong>symmetric</strong> about the line $x=5$. So the median must be $5$.</p>

<p>To find the result of $\left(\begin{matrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; -1\\0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\end{matrix}\right)$ $\left(\begin{matrix} e_1\\e_2\\e_3\end{matrix}\right) = \left(\begin{matrix} 0\\0\\0\end{matrix}\right)$, I set $e_2$ and $e_3$ as free variables $s$ and $t$, respectively, solved for $e_1$ and put into vector form:</p>

<p>$$\left[\begin{matrix} -2s + t\\s\\t\end{matrix}\right] = s \left[\begin{matrix} -2\\1\\0\end{matrix}\right] + t \left[\begin{matrix}1\\0\\1\end{matrix}\right]$$</p>

<p>So for the first two Eigenvectors, I found $v_1 = [-2, 1, 0]^{T}$ and $v_2 = [1, 0, 1]^T$. However, checking my answer on Wolfram Alpha, $v_1$ is assigned to the latter and $v_2$ is assigned to the former. Does this matter? </p>

<p>If so, should I instead find the first Eigenvector for $\lambda_1$ then using the same reduced matrix set it equal to the result of $v_1$ instead of the zero vector for $\lambda_2$? I.e., solving the above matrix for $\lambda_1$:
$$e_1 = -2e_2 + e_3 \rightarrow  1 = -2(0) + 1 $$
$$v_1 = [1, 0, 1]^T$$</p>

<p>And then for $\lambda_2$:</p>

<p>$$\left(\begin{matrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; -1\\0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\end{matrix}\right) \left(\begin{matrix} e_1\\e_2\\e_3\end{matrix}\right) = \left(\begin{matrix} 1\\0\\1\end{matrix}\right)$$</p>

<p>However, using $e_3$ as a free variable where $e_3 = 0$, I don't get the above vector I originally found for $v_1$:</p>

<p>$$e_1 + 2e_2 = 1 \rightarrow 1(2) + 2(-1/2) = 1$$
$$v_2 = [2, -1/2, 0]^T$$</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong here?</p>
","<p>It is not a good idea to label your eigenvalues $\lambda_1$, $\lambda_2$, $\lambda_3$; there are not three eigenvalues, there are only two; namely $\lambda_1=-2$ and $\lambda_2=1$.</p>

<p>Now for the eigenvalue $\lambda_1$, there are infinitely many eigenvectors. If you throw the zero vector into the set of all eigenvectors for $\lambda_1$, then you obtain a vector space, $E_1$, called the eigenspace of the eigenvalue $\lambda_1$. This vector space has dimension <em>at most</em> the multiplicity of $\lambda_1$ in the characteristic polynomial of $A$.  In this case, looking at the characteristic polynomial of $A$, we see that the dimension of the eigenspace  $E_1$ is at most two. </p>

<p>As you determined, the dimension of $E_1$ is exactly two, as you found two independent eigenvectors for $\lambda_1$. Your eigenvectors $v_1$ and $v_2$ form a basis of $E_1$.  It does not matter that WA listed them in the opposite order, they are still two independent eigenvectors for $\lambda_1$; and  any eigenvector for $\lambda_1$ is a linear combination of $v_1$ and $v_2$.</p>

<p>Now you need to find the eigenvectors for $\lambda_2$.  Note the dimension of the eigenspace  must be one here (since the multiplicity of $\lambda_2$ in the characteristic polynomial is 1). </p>

Each of them has 8 symbols on it. There is a total of 50 different symbols and each two cards have one and only one in common.</p>

<p>I am wondering, given a total number of symbols N and a number of symbols on each card K, how do you find the biggest number of cards such that:</p>

<ul>
<li>on each of those cards there are exactly K of the N symbols,</li>
<li>every two cards have one and only one symbol in common.</li>
</ul>
","<p>A combinatorial term that applies is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_design"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">uniform block design</a>. Here the word uniform means all blocks contain the same number of points (8 symbols, in the case described).</p>

<p>One supposes (although not explicitly stated) that of the 50 different symbols (see <strong>endnote</strong>), each appears on some card.  But with 8 symbols on each of 55 cards, it is not possible that all symbols appear an equal number of times.  Nor is it possible that every symbol is shared by an equal number of pairs of Dobble cards (though perhaps every symbol is shared by at least one pair).</p>

<p>A similar question <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/q/442043/3111"">was posted here recently</a>, also about the maximum number of blocks subject to uniform size and singleton intersections of (distinct) block pairs.  Since posting my Answer there, I've progressed a bit in understanding these designs and found some relevant literature that, as yet, I've not added to that post.</p>

<p>Given the partial nature of that Answer, I'm going to summarize it and preview my further investigations, but mark this as Community Wiki and vote to close the Question itself as a duplicate.  This is not a criticism of the Question, which I think is excellent, but an expression of the Community policy to keep duplication to a minimum.</p>

<p>The property that every pair of cards shares exactly one common symbol is more often treated from the dual viewpoint, taking the cards to be ""points"" of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_geometry"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">an incidence design</a> whose ""lines"" are defined by the symbols (i.e. the collection of cards that contain a given symbol).  In this ""dual design"" the lines (blocks) are not equal in size (necessarily), but the number of ""points"" on a (dual) line is always the same.  This property is called regularity.</p>

<p>More important is that the singleton intersections of our original blocks (the sets of symbols common to one card) becomes a property that every pair of dual points is incident to exactly one dual line.  This dual design is thus what is termed <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_design#Fundamental_combinatorial_designs"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a (nontrivial) pairwise balanced design (PBD)</a>.</p>

<p>An important result, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_inequality#Generalization"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a generalization of Fisher's inequality</a>, then applies to this dual design and allows us to conclude that the number of dual lines (symbols) is greater than or equal to the number of dual points (card in the original design).  It also tells us that equality (maximizing the number of cards to equal the number of symbols) can only happen with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_space"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">projective designs</a>.</p>

<p>Sadly there are projective designs known for only certain parameters, constructed from finite fields and thus associated with their prime power orders.  It is an open conjecture that these are the only projective design orders (although the same prime power may give rise to nonisomorphic projective designs in some cases, but involving the same number of points/lines).  The dual of a projective design is again a projective design (though not necessarily the same design).</p>

<p>In looking for more flexible design parameters I came across work by Osvaldo Marrero, starting with his 1970 dissertation, <a href=""http://scholarlyrepository.miami.edu/dissertations/323/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Modular Hadamard Matrices And Related Combinatorial Designs</a>.  Specifically related to the present Question are what Marrero calls <em>pseudo</em>-$(v,k,1)$ designs, which amounts to the case of having one fewer block (card) than points (symbols) in terms of the ""original"" design, which are <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0097316573900733"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">completely characterized</a>.  Here $v$ is the number of points (symbols) and $k$ is the number of those per block (card).</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>  The count of 50 symbols is incorrect, since the theory tells us there must be at least as many symbols as cards in these designs.  Actually the <a href=""http://www.marblesthebrainstore.com/files/rules/Spot_It_Rules.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">documentation</a> (Dobble is also sold under the Spot It! brand) says, ""There are more than 50 symbols in all.""  The <a href=""http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobble"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">French Wikipedia article</a> links indirectly <a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/32602239/Dobble"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">to a Scribd article</a> which claims at the end to have verified ""by hand"" a count of 57 symbols.  Removing two blocks (cards) out of 57 from a projective design of order 7 would indeed leave all 57 points (symbols) appearing in more than one remaining block. </p>

<p>PS. I've read the <a href=""http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.0.to.0.power.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">explanation</a> on mathforum.org, but it isn't clear to me.</p>
","<p>In general, there is no good answer as to what $0^0$ ""should"" be, so it is usually left undefined.</p>

<p>Basically, if you consider $x^y$ as a function of two variables, then there is no limit as $(x,y)\to(0,0)$ (with $x\geq 0$): if you approach along the line $y=0$, then you get $\lim\limits_{x\to 0^+} x^0 = \lim\limits_{x\to 0^+} 1 = 1$; so perhaps we should define $0^0=1$? Well, the problem is that if you approach along the line $x=0$, then you get $\lim\limits_{y\to 0^+}0^y = \lim\limits_{y\to 0^+} 0 = 0$. So should we define it $0^0=0$? </p>

<p>Well, if you approach along other curves, you'll get other answers. Since $x^y = e^{y\ln(x)}$, if you approach along the curve $y=\frac{1}{\ln(x)}$, then you'll get a limit of $e$; if you approach along the curve $y=\frac{\ln(7)}{\ln(x)}$, then you get a limit of $7$. And so on. There is just no good answer from the analytic point of view. So, for calculus and algebra, we just don't want to give it any value, we just declare it undefined.</p>

<p><strong>However</strong>, from a set-theory point of view, there actually is one and only one sensible answer to what $0^0$ should be! In set theory, $A^B$ is the set of all functions from $B$ to $A$; and when $A$ and $B$ denote ""size"" (cardinalities), then the ""$A^B$"" is defined to be the size of the set of all functions from $A$ to $B$. In this context, $0$ is the empty set, so $0^0$ is the collection of all functions from the empty set to the empty set. And, as it turns out, there <em>is</em> one (and only one) function from the empty set to the empty set: the empty function. So the set $0^0$ has one and only one element, and therefore we <em>must</em> define $0^0$ as $1$. So if we are talking about <em>cardinal exponentiation</em>, then the only possible definition is $0^0=1$, and we define it that way, period. </p>

<p><strong>Added 2:</strong> the same holds in Discrete Mathematics, when we are mostly interested in ""counting"" things. In Discrete Mathematics, $n^m$ represents the number of ways in which you can make $m$ selections out of $n$ possibilities, when repetitions are allowed and the order matters. (This is <em>really</em> the same thing as ""maps from $\{1,2,\ldots,m\}$ to $\\{1,2,\ldots,n\\}$"" when interpreted appropriately, so it is again the same thing as in set theory). </p>

<p>So what should $0^0$ be? It should be the number of ways in which you can make no selections when you have no things to choose from. Well, there is exactly <strong>one</strong> way of doing that: just sit and do nothing! So we  make $0^0$ equal to $1$, because that is the correct number of ways in which we can do the thing that $0^0$ represents. (This, as opposed to $0^1$, say, where you are required to make $1$ choice with nothing to choose from; in that case, you <em>cannot</em> do it, so the answer is that $0^1=0$). </p>

<p>Your ""train of thoughts"" don't really work: If $x\neq 0$, then $0^x$ means ""the number of ways to make $x$ choices from $0$ possibilities"". This number is $0$. So for <em>any</em> number $k$, you have $k\cdot 0^x = 0 = 0^x$, hence you cannot say that the equation $0^0\cdot 0^x = 0^x$ suggests that $0^0$ ""should"" be $1$. The second argument also doesn't work because you cannot divide by $0$, which is what you get with $0^x$ when $x\neq 0$. So it really comes down to what you want $a^b$ to mean, and in discrete mathematics, when $a$ and $b$ are nonnegative integers, it's a count: it's the number of distinct ways in which you can do a certain thing (described above), and that leads necessarily to the definition that makes $0^0$ equal to $1$: because $1$ 
<em>is</em> the number of ways of making no selections from no choices.</p>

<p><strong>Coda.</strong> In the end, it is a matter of definition and utility. In Calculus and  algebra, there is no reasonable definition (the closest you can come up with is trying to justify it via the binomial theorem or via power series, which I personally think is a bit weak), and it is far more useful to leave it undefined or indeterminate, since otherwise it would lead to all sorts of exceptions when dealing with the limit laws.

"How many equivalence relations on a set with 4 elements.","27585","","<p>Let S be a set containing 4 elements (I choose {$a,b,c,d$}). How many possible equivalence relations are there?</p>

Is there a better way to do this or am I on the right track? </p>
","<p>An equivalence relation divides the underlying set into <strong>equivalence classes.</strong> The equivalence classes determine the relation, and the relation determines the equivalence classes.

"What is difference between standard deviation and Z-score?","27540","","<p>I have read several explanations of standard deviation and z-score, I know how to it calculate them but I am not sure what is differences betwen them.</p>

<p>Can someone explain it to me? When is suitable to use stdev and when z-score?</p>
","<p>Typically you have a collection of values of some variable. If the variable is human height, these values might be expressed in inches or centimetres; if it’s human weight, in pounds or kilograms. The standard deviation is a specific number of these units; roughly speaking, it’s the size of a typical deviation from the mean of these measurements. To compare two different collections of measurements, it’s generally very desirable to express them in units that make these typical deviations the same size. We might call such units <em>standard units</em>: standard units are units chosen so that the mean (average) of the measurements is $0$, and a typical deviation $-$ technically, the standard deviation $-$ has size $1$. The $z$-scores are just the original measurements expressed in these standard units instead of the original units of measurement.</p>

<p>The conversion is actually quite similar to the conversion between two more familiar units of measurement. If you measure a length in inches (or centimetres) and then convert that measurement to feet (or metres), you have to multiply by $\frac1{12}$ (or $\frac1{100}$), because each inch is $\frac1{12}$ of a foot (each centimetre is $\frac1{100}$ of a metre). Suppose that you’re measuring human heights, and you get a standard deviation of $3$ inches. Then for this sample $1$ standard unit is $3$ inches, and each inch is $1/3$ of a standard unit. Someone whose height is $4.5$ inches above the mean is $4.5\cdot\frac13=1.5$ standard units above the average. This deviation of $1.5$ standard units is the $z$-score corresponding to that height of $4.5$ inches above average.</p>

<p>You might say that the standard deviation is a yardstick, and a $z$-score is a measurement expressed in terms of that yardstick.</p>

<p>The situation is a little different from simple conversion between inches and feet, though. It’s more like conversion between Fahrenheit and Celsius temperatures: not only does the size of the unit change, but also the $0$ point. Just as $0^\circ$ C is $32^\circ$ F, not $0^\circ$ F, the $0$ point for $z$-scores is generally not the same as the $0$ point for the actual measurements. A sample of adult American males, for instance, might have an average height of $70$ inches, so that someone $4.5$ inches above the average would be $74.5$ inches tall. The $0$ point for $z$-scores, measured in standard units, is always right at the average, so in this case a height of $70$ inches would correspond to a $z$-score of $0$. A height of $74.5$ inches, being $4.5$ inches and therefore (as we saw before) $1.5$ standard units above average, would correspond to a $z$-score of $0+1.5=1.5$. And so on.</p>

<p>When you calculate $$z=\frac{x-\bar x}s$$ to get a $z$-score $z$ from a measurement $x$, you’re doing the same kind of unit conversion that you do in converting a temperature from one scale to the other. The calculation $x-\bar x$ gives you the deviation of your actual measurement from the mean; in my example, that’s $74.5-70=4.5$ inches. When you divide by $s$, the standard deviation, you’re changing ‘yardsticks’ from inches to standard units. In the example $s=3$ inches, so you’re multiplying the deviation of $4.5$ inches by the conversion (scaling) factor of $\frac13$ of a standard unit per inch.</p>

<p>One point of these standard units is that the permit comparison of distributions. For example, women are on average shorter than men, <strong>and</strong> their heights vary a bit less. Thus, a woman who is $3$ inches above the female average is, relative to the female population, taller than a man who is $3$ inches above the male average. But how much taller? Use of standard units makes it possible to answer that kind of question. I’m using data that are now a bit out of date, but very roughly she is $1.2$ standard units above the female average, while he is only $1$ standard unit above the male average.</p>

Especially when the field is $\mathbb{R}$, you can see that geometrically, this function acts on the space by ""scaling"" a vector (stretching or contracting it and possibly reflecting it).

You’re right that $\bigcup\mathscr{U}$, being a union of open sets, must be open in $X$, but it needn’t be equal to $K$.</p>

<p>For example, suppose that $X=\Bbb R$ and $K=[0,3]$; the family $\{(-1,2),(1,4)\}$ is an open cover of $[0,3]$: it’s a family of open sets, and $[0,3]\subseteq(-1,2)\cup(1,4)=(-1,4)$. And yes, $(-1,4)$ is certainly open in $\Bbb R$, but $[0,3]$ is not.</p>

<p>Note, by the way, that it’s not actually true that a compact subset of an arbitrary topological space is closed. For example, let $\tau$ be the cofinite topology on $\Bbb Z$: the open sets are $\varnothing$ and the sets whose complements in $\Bbb Z$ are finite. It’s a straightforward exercise to show that <strong>every</strong> subset of $\Bbb Z$ is compact in this topology, but the only closed sets are the finite ones and $\Bbb Z$ itself. Thus, for example, $\Bbb Z^+$ is a compact subset that isn’t closed.</p>

<p>It is true, however, that compact sets in Hausdorff spaces are closed, though a bit of work is required to establish the result.</p>

","<p>Best to look at this with an example.  Suppose my hypothesis takes on the form $$H_0 : \mu = \mu_0 \quad {\rm vs.} \quad H_a : \mu &lt; \mu_0.$$  Now, if I calculate the test statistic $$T = \frac{\bar x - \mu_0}{s/\sqrt{n}} \sim t_{n-1},$$ and I obtain a value of $T = 1.45$, then <em>immediately</em> I know that the data does not suggest that $\mu &lt; \mu_0$; i.e., there is insufficient evidence to reject the null, because the test statistic is <em>positive</em>:  the sample mean exceeds the hypothesized mean.  On the other hand, if I calculate the test statistic and obtain $T = -2.5$ for $n-1 = 11$ degrees of freedom, then I would look up $2.5$ in the table you have above and find that the resulting $p$-value is approximately $0.015$.

<p>$$\cos(c)=\frac{1}{3}$$</p>

<p>In other words, i'm trying to solve for c and without a calculator. If it's hard or not possible, then how would you go about solving inverses in general. For example, lets say:</p>

<p>$$\cos(c)=\frac{3+1}{2\sqrt{2}}$$</p>

<p>how would we solve for c, which in this case is 105</p>
","<p>The first step is to stop and think about the problem itself. What is the cosine? If you recall, the formula for cosine (remember SOHCAHTOA?) is adjacent over hypotenuse. So, with your $\frac{1}{3}$ example, $1$ represents the length of the adjacent side, and $3$ represents the hypotenuse.</p>

<p>In other words, the hypotenuse is going to be 3 times longer than the adjacent side. Picture that on the unit circle. The hypotenuse, as always on the unit circle, would have a length of 1, and the measurement along the $x$ axis would only be $0.\overline{3}$.</p>

<p>That's a pretty steep angle. Just from this mental picture, you can already realize that it's going to be much greater than $45^{\circ}$, and probably even more than $60^{\circ}$.</p>

<hr>

<p>Ronald Doerfler, in his book <i>Dead Reckoning: Calculating Without Instruments</i>, teaches an estimation method for finding $arccos(x)$, or $cos^{-1}(x)$ (both just mean finding the original angle given its cosine) in degrees.</p>

<p>His estimation formula for $cos^{-1}(x)$ is: $\sqrt{7(1000-1000x)}-\frac{1}{2}$</p>

<p>This looks bad, but can be done mentally with practice. Using your $\frac{1}{3}$ example, let's step through that one step at a time.</p>

<p>This works better with decimals, so we'll switch from $\frac{1}{3}$ to $0.\overline{3}$.</p>

<p><b>Step 1:</b> $1000\times0.\overline{3}=333.\overline{3}$, which we'll round to $333$.</p>

<p><b>Step 2:</b> $1000-333=667$. Subtracting from 1000 is easy. If you're not already familiar with the mental method for this, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qf_45zM68R4"" rel=""nofollow"">this video will give you a quick refresher</a>.</p>

<p><b>Step 3:</b> $667\times7$? Work this out mentally from left to right! $600\times7=4200$, $60\times7=420$, and $7\times7=49$, so we've got $4200+420+49=4620+49=4669$.</p>

<p><b>Step 4:</b> $\sqrt{4669}$?!? How are you supposed to do that in your head?!? First, you should be familiar with <a href=""http://gmmentalgym.blogspot.com/2011/01/squaring-2-digit-numbers-mentally.html#sqbasics"" rel=""nofollow"">mentally squaring 2-digit numbers</a>. I know $65^{2}=4225$ and $70^{2}=4900$, so I can quickly figure that $\sqrt{4669}$ is somewhere between $65$ and $70$.</p>

<p>Mentally figure that $67^{2}=4489$. Hmmm...perhaps $68^{2}$ or $69^{2}$ would be closer. $68^{2}=4624$ and $69^{2}=4761$, so the answer is obviously $68$ point something.</p>

<p>We can even quickly refine that, <a href=""http://headinside.blogspot.com/2012/07/estimating-square-roots.html"" rel=""nofollow"">using other mental square root estimation techniques</a>. $4669-4624=45$, so we can use the linked technique to realize that $\sqrt{4669}\approx68\frac{45}{137}$, or about $68\frac{1}{3}$.</p>

<p><b>Step 5:</b> $68\frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{2}=67\frac{5}{6}$, so this method has given us an estimated angle of about $68^{\circ}$.</p>

<hr>

<p>Through experience, I've found a way to improve on Ronald Doerfler's above estimate.</p>

<p>Before step 1, take note of the tenths digit of your original $x$. With $0.\overline{3}$, the tenths digit is obviously $3$.</p>

<p>Whenever this digit is less than 6 (for 6 through 9, no adjustment is needed), you're going to add $6$ minus this digit, to the number of degrees, as a last step.</p>

<p>Since the original tenths digit was $3$ in this case, we'll add $6-3=3$ more degrees. $68+3=71$, so we have an adjusted estimate of about $71^{\circ}$.</p>

<hr>

<p>If you actually work out <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=arccos%281%2F3%29+in+degrees"" rel=""nofollow"">$cos^{-1}(\frac{1}{3})$</a> with a calculator, you'll find the answer is $70.53^{\circ}$, so our mental estimate of $71^{\circ}$ is quite close!</p>

convex region of Jerome is uniquely determined by its vertices.</p>

<p>Both ways allow me to draw the figure.  Note that the simple average (mean) does not distinguish order; it can't give the correct answer.  </p></li>
<li><p>Jerome is a plane figure:  Its mass is proportional to area.  But ""the mean of coordinates"" is not the same thing as ""proportional to area"".  Area <em>of what</em>? Again, the mean can't, in general, give an answer.<br></p></li>

<p>I now have a unique definition of the task.  I have also discarded the simple average where it can't apply, without knowing the answer or doing any math.

<p>If you're lucky, you can obtain the solution, if any, through ad-hoc methods by examining the ""sparse"" row equivalent form of the augmented matrix.</p>

<p>Note here that the augmented matrix for your system is row equivalent to (adding multiples of row 1 to the others):
$$\begin{pmatrix} 1&amp;2&amp;1&amp;1&amp;1&amp;\ \ 6.3 \\ 1&amp;-1&amp;1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;\ \ .4 \\ 0&amp;0&amp;2&amp;0&amp;0&amp;\ \ 1.4 \\ 1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;2&amp;\ \ 3.5\\1&amp;-1&amp;3&amp;0&amp;0&amp;\ \ -1.7 \end{pmatrix}  $$</p>

<p>The above is row equivalent to (working with rows 2 and 5):</p>

"How to calculate probabilities for football match?","26817","","<p>I am looking for the acceptible methods to calculate probability chances ""1 x 2"" on football matches. I read a lot of articles, but there are no useful information that can help me. I started to investigate probability theory myself and I freezed after some calculations.
Let imagine we have match between Chelsea and Liverpool. I understand how calculate probabilitly for each team. I took last ten Chelsea's home matches and last ten Liverpool's away matches. After simple calculations(win/10; draw/10; lose/10) I received:</p>

<pre><code>P(Chelsea win at home) = 0,5; 
P(Chelsea draw at home)=0,3; 
P(Chelsea lose at home) = 0,2;

P(Liverpool win away) = 0,2; 
P(Liverpool draw away)=0,6; 
P(Liverpool lose away) = 0,2;
</code></pre>

<p>But I could now understand how to use this calculated data to predict match Chelsea - Liverpool. I tries to apply sum and multiplication theorems, but there could be incredible result, for exmaple over 1. I definetly understand that this calculation would be very approximatly and that there are a lot of parameters that affect on football result, but I think that it could be useful to predict match. Thank you for any help!</p>
","<p>What you have to do is to normalize the data. A simple way for it:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add the probabilities which show the same result, to each other. In you example, you have to add Chelsea wins to Liverpool losses, Chelsea draws to Liverpool draws and Chelsea losses to Liverpool wins.</li>
</ul>

<p>What you'll have is:</p>

<p>Chelsea Win: $0.55+0.25=0.80$</p>

<p>Draw: $0.35+0.55=0.90$</p>

<p>Liverpool Win: $0.10+0.20=0.30$</p>

<ul>
<li>Then, divide those possibilities to two, to normalize the probabilities. Why two? Because you have two teams.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chelsea Win: $0.40$
Draw: $0.45$
Liverpool Win: $0.15$</p>

<p>Of course, in real world it's not that simple as you have to calculate last 5 games form, injured and banned players and the statistics when they're not playing, last game score and date, games between those two teams in last 10 years etc. </p>

<p>For instance, in Turkey, Galatasaray hasn't won against Fenerbahçe away in last 15 years. Even Galatasaray was way ahead champion, they just couldn't win against Fenerbahçe. So, when calculating the probable result of Fenerbahçe - Galatasaray game, you have to consider that curse. So, in any game, you can't only look at their whole season form, or only last 5 games, or only ""something"". You have to consider each effect, and this is what makes the calculation complex.</p>

"Why are there 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons on a soccer ball?","26776","","<p>Edge-attaching many hexagons results in a plane. Edge-attaching pentagons yields a dodecahedron.</p>

<p>Is there some insight into why the alternation of pentagons and hexagons yields an approximated sphere? Is this special, or are there an arbitrary number of assorted <em>n-gons</em> sets that may be joined together to create regular sphere-like surfaces?</p>
","<p>The possible ways to put polygons together to form a sphere-like object are constrained by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_characteristic"" rel=""nofollow"">Euler's formula</a> $V - E + F = 2$ (where $V$ is the number of vertices, $E$ is the number of edges, and $F$ is the number of faces).  Equivalently you can think of this as a statement about <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planar_graph"" rel=""nofollow"">planar graphs</a>.</p>

<p>Suppose we use $f_3$ triangles, $f_4$ squares, $f_5$ pentagons, etc.  Every edge meets exactly two faces, and an edge of type $f_n$ meets $n$ faces, so let's double-count the number of pairs of an edge and a face next to it: on the one hand, this is $2E$, and on the other hand, this is</p>

<p>$$3f_3 + 4f_4 + 5f_5 + ...$$</p>

<p>Plugging this into Euler's formula gives $V - \frac{f_3 + 2f_4 + 3f_5 + ...}{2} = 2$.  If in addition the polyhedron is <em>convex</em> and the polygons are <em>regular</em>, there are constraints on the faces that can meet at each vertex coming from the fact that the angles must sum up to less than $360^{\circ}$.  (This is one way to prove the classification of Platonic solids.)  For example, at most $5$ faces can meet at each vertex if we allow arbitrary faces; this means $3f_3 + 4f_4 + ... \le 5V$.  (If you really want to, you can allow six triangles to touch at one point, but I would just count this as a hexagon.)  If we don't allow triangles, <em>exactly</em> $3$ faces meet at each vertex; this means $4f_4 + 5f_5 + ... = 3V$.  </p>

<p>Here is an application in chemistry: a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fullerene"" rel=""nofollow"">fullerene</a> is a certain type of molecule made from carbon atoms.  (One of these, the buckyball, looks just like a soccer ball.)  It gives a convex polyhedron in which each face is either a regular pentagon or hexagon.  This gives $V - \frac{3f_5 + 4f_6}{2} = 2$ on the one hand, and $3V = 5f_5 + 6f_6$ on the other.  Together these equations give $f_5 = 12$ and $V - 2f_6 = 20$; in other words, any fullerene must have <strong>exactly twelve pentagons</strong> (Twelve Pentagon theorem for fullerene).</p>

<p>(Hexagons are special.  One way to interpret this result is that an infinite plane can be tiled with hexagons, so hexagons correspond to zero curvature, whereas since pentagons have a smaller angle at each vertex they correspond to positive curvature.  What the above statement says, roughly, is that the total amount of curvature is a constant.  This is a simple form of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Bonnet_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">Gauss-Bonnet theorem</a>, which is closely related to Euler's formula.)</p>

<p>Here are some other things you can prove, again under the assumptions of convexity and regularity:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you only use triangles (as opposed to triangles and hexagons), then $f_3 \le 20$ and $4 | f_3$.</li>
<li>If you only use squares, then $f_4 = 6$.</li>
<li>You cannot use only hexagons or higher.  (In the Gauss-Bonnet picture, attempting to use heptagons corresponds to negative curvature, and negative curvature does not interact well with Euclidean or spherical geometry; the natural setting for putting heptagons together is instead <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry"" rel=""nofollow"">hyperbolic geometry</a>.)</li>
</ul>

<p>This is already most of the way to the classification of Platonic solids.

"How does Tree(3) grow to get so big? Need laymen explanation.","26775","","<p>I am not a mathematician but I am interested in big numbers.  I find them to be really interesting, almost god-like.</p>

<p>I am watching <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHXzJSXIJBM"">a series of videos</a> from David Metzler on youTube.  I have a basic understanding of some fast growing functions.  David does not cover Tree(n) which I've read is one of the fastest growing functions.  I've looked at it explained in many places and even asked someone via Quora to help explain it to me, but I still don't get it.  I think I need some sort of example of what Tree(1), Tree(2) and so on look like.  </p>

<p>If anyone could help me understand it I'd be really appreciative.</p>
","<p>I'll try to answer.  It's a rather difficult question since (1) answering why something in mathematics is the way it is is troublesome; and (2) this subject has technical details that make it difficult to give a ""layman's explanation"".</p>

<p>It appears that you have watched David Metzler's videos on fast-growing functions, so you know a little about ordinals, and specifically on how they give rise to fast-growing functions.  I will first describe a function on ordinals that outputs fast-growing functions;  second, I will explain how this relates to the tree(n) function, which is about sequences of unlabelled trees;  finally, I will show how the TREE(n) function, which is about labelled trees, grows even faster.  So bear with me here.</p>

<p>First, let us assume that for every limit ordinal (a limit ordinal is an ordinal with no predecessor) in a sufficiently large initial segment of ordinals, we have defined a fundamental sequence;  that is, an increasing sequence of ordinals whose limit is the original ordinal.  So for $\omega$ we can take the sequence {0, 1, 2, ...}; for $\omega * 2$ we can take the sequence $\\{ \omega, \omega + 1, \omega + 2, \ldots, \\}$;  for $\omega ^ 2$, we can take the sequence $\\{ 0, \omega, \omega * 2, \ldots, \\}$; and so on.  For an ordinal $\alpha$, define $\alpha [n]$ to be the $n$th element of the fundamental sequence of $\alpha$ when $\alpha$ is a limit ordinal, and the predecessor of $\alpha$ when $\alpha$ is a successor ordinal. </p>

<p>Notice that $\alpha[n] &lt; \alpha$ for all ordinals $\alpha$ and natural numbers $n$.  So $\alpha, \alpha[n], \alpha[n][n+1], \alpha[n][n+1][n+2], \ldots$ is a strictly decreasing sequence of ordinals.  A defining property of ordinals is that there is no infinite decreasing sequence of ordinals;  so for $\alpha &gt; 0$, there exists a minimal natural number $m$ so that $\alpha[n][n+1] \ldots [m] = 0$.  Define $H(\alpha,n)$ to be this minimal $m$.</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<p>$1[n] = 0$ for all $n$, so $H(1,n) = n$.</p>

<p>$2[n] = 1, 2[n][n+1] = 0$ for all $n$, so $H(2, n) = n+1$.</p>

<p>Similarly, $m[n][n+1] \ldots [n+m-1] = 0$, for all $n$, so $H(m, n) = n + m - 1$.</p>

<p>$\omega[n] = n, \omega[n][n+1] = n-1, \ldots, \omega[n][n+1] \ldots [2n] = 0$, so $H(\omega, n) = 2n$.</p>

<p>$(\omega+1)[n] = \omega, (\omega+1)[n][n+1] = n+1, (\omega+1)[n][n+1] \ldots [2n+2] = 0$, so $H(\omega+1, n) = 2n + 2$.</p>

<p>Similarly, $H(\omega+m, n) = 2n + 2m$.</p>

<p>$(\omega * 2)[n] = \omega + n, (\omega*2)[n]\ldots[2n] = \omega, (\omega*2)[n]\ldots[2n+1] = 2n+1, (\omega*2)[n]\ldots[4n+2] = 0$, so $H(\omega*2, n) = 4n + 2$.</p>

<p>Similarly, $H(\omega * 2 + m, n) = 4n + 4m + 2$.</p>

<p>$H(\omega*3, n) = 4(2n+1) + 2 = 8n + 6$.</p>

<p>$H(\omega*4, n) = 8(2n+1) + 6 = 16n + 14$.</p>

<p>$H(\omega*m, n) = 2^m n + 2^m - 2$.</p>

<p>$H(\omega^2, n) = 2^n (n+2) - 2 &gt; F_2 (n) &gt; 2^n$. (Here $F_{\alpha}(n)$ is the fast-growing hierarchy as described in Metzler's videos.)</p>

<p>$H(\omega^3, n) &gt; F_3 (n) &gt; 2 \uparrow \uparrow n$.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>$H(\omega^{\omega}, n) &gt; F_{\omega}(n) &gt; $ Ackermann($n, n$).</p>

<p>$H(\omega^{\omega^{\omega}}, n) &gt; F_{\omega^{\omega}}(n)$.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>$H(\varepsilon_0, n) &gt; F_{\varepsilon_0}(n-1)$.</p>

<p>...and so on.  As you can see, this construction leads to the same large numbers as the fast-growing hierarchy.  In general, $H(\omega^{\alpha}, n)$ is approximately $ F_{\alpha} (n)$.</p>

<p>Okay, on to trees.  Define tree(n) to be the longest sequence of unlabelled, unordered trees $T_1, T_2, \ldots$ such that, for all $i$, $T_i$ has at most $n + i$ vertices, and for all $i, j$ with $i &lt; j$, $T_i$ is not homeomorphically embeddable into $T_j$.</p>

<p>One might wonder why the sequence can't be infinite.  This is basically because trees, ordered under embeddability, are ""well-quasi-ordered"", or WQO.  This means that it has the same ""no infinite descending sequence"" property that ordinals have, but it may have elements that are incomparable.  In fact it does:  take one tree to be a root with two children, and another to be a tree with a child and a grandchild.  These two trees are incomparable; neither one embeds in the other.</p>

<p>So, trees under embeddability are not well-ordered.  But we can extend our partial order to a well-order;  we will use a modification of the well-ordering used by Levitz and Jervell.  (The Levitz/Jervell ordering is for ordered trees;  we need one for unordered trees.)</p>

<p>We don't really need the exact details of the well-ordering, but I will give it here for reference.  Given two trees, $S$ and $T$, we use the following comparison algorithm.  First check, inductively, if $S$ is less than or equal to any of the immediate subtrees of $T$;  if so, then $S &lt; T$.  Similarly, check if $T$ is less than or equal to any of the immediate subtrees of $S$; if so, then $T &lt; S$.  If neither of those checks apply, then compare the number of children of the root of $S$ to the number of children of the root of $T$;  the tree with the larger number is greater.  Finally, if the roots of $S$ and $T$ have the same number of children, compare the immediate subtrees of $S$ and $T$ one by one, starting from the smallest pair, then going to the second smallest pair, etc.  The first time you find two different immediate subtrees, the greater of the two will belong to the greater original tree.</p>

<p>Okay, so now we have a well-ordering of trees, such that if $T_i &lt; T_j$, then $T_i$ is not embeddable into $T_j$.  This gives us a strategy for constructing long sequences of trees that obey the required conditions:  take $T_{i+1}$ to be the largest tree less than $T_i$ with no more than the largest allowable number of nodes.</p>

<p>So, what kind of numbers do we get?  Well, the situation is very similar to our above sequences of decreasing ordinals!  For example, let the tree $T$ consist of a single path of $m$ vertices; this corresponds to the finite ordinal $m$. Let $n$ be the maximum allowable number of vertices in the next tree.  Then the next tree, which we will denote $T[n]$, will be a path of $m-1$ vertices, which corresponds to the ordinal $m-1$, which is exactly $m[n]$.  Similarly, the next tree, $T[n][n+1]$, will correspond to the ordinal $m[n][n+1]$, and so on, so we will reach the empty tree at the same time the corresponding ordinal reaches 0, so the length of the sequence starting from $T$ will be $H(m, n) - n + 1$.</p>

<p>Similarly, suppose $T$ is the tree where the root has two childless children.  This corresponds to the ordinal $\omega$.  $T[n]$ will then be a path of n nodes, which is the tree that corresponds to the ordinal $\omega[n]$.  So we reach the empty tree at $T[n] \ldots [2n]$, since $\omega[n] \ldots [2n] = 0$.  So the length of the sequence starting from $T$ is $H(\omega, n) - n + 1 = n + 1$.  For larger trees/ordinals, we won't get a length of exactly $H(\alpha, n) - n + 1$, but it will be pretty close.  </p>

<p>So, if we start from a tree corresponding to $\omega^{\alpha}$, we will get a function comparable to $F_{\alpha}$ in the fast-growing hierarchy.  The natural question to ask is:  what is the ordinal corresponding to this well-ordering of trees?</p>

<p>Metzler's videos decribes the Veblen hierarchy, going up to $\Gamma_0$.  We can continue on by defining $\phi(1, 0, \alpha)$ to be the $\alpha$th fixed point of $f(x) = \phi(x, 0)$. (So $\phi(1, 0, 0) = \Gamma_0$.)  We then define a second Veblen hierarchy where the starting function is $\phi(1, 0, \alpha)$ instead of $\omega^{\alpha}$; so</p>

<p>$\phi(1, \alpha+1, \beta)$ is the $\beta$th fixed point of $f(x) = \phi(1, \alpha, x)$.</p>

<p>When $\alpha$ is a limit ordinal,
$\phi(1, \alpha, \beta)$ is the $\beta$th ordinal in the ranges of $f(x) = \phi (1, \gamma, x)$ for all $\gamma &lt; \alpha$.</p>

<p>We can then define</p>

<p>$\phi(2, 0, \alpha)$ to be the $\alpha$th fixed point of $f(x) = \phi(1, x, 0)$.</p>

<p>More generally, we define</p>

<p>$\phi(\alpha+1, 0, \beta)$ to be the $\beta$th fixed point of $f(x) = \phi(\alpha, x, 0)$</p>

<p>and for $\alpha$ a limit ordinal,</p>

<p>$\phi(\alpha, 0, \beta)$ is the $\beta$th ordinal in the ranges of $f(x) = \phi(\gamma, x, 0)$ for all $\gamma &lt; \alpha$.</p>

<p>Next, we can go to 4 places: define</p>

<p>$\phi (\alpha+1, 0, 0, \beta)$ to be the $\beta$th fixed point of $f(x) = \phi(\alpha, x, 0, 0)$</p>

<p>and for $\alpha$ a limit ordinal</p>

<p>$\phi (\alpha, 0, 0, \beta)$ is the $\beta$th ordinal in the ranges of $f(x) = \phi(\gamma, x, 0, 0)$ for all $\gamma &lt; \alpha$.</p>

<p>You can see how to extend this to arbitrarily many places.  The smallest ordinal that cannot be reached by applying this extended phi notation is called the Small Veblen ordinal.</p>

<p>Well, it turns out that the Small Veblen ordinal is the limit of Levitz'/Jervell's well-ordering.  In particular,</p>

<p>the tree whose root has two childless children corresponds to $\omega$.
the tree whose root has three childless children corresponds to $\epsilon_0$.
the tree whose root has four childless children corresponds to $\phi(1,0,0,0)$.
In general, the tree whose root has n childless children for $n \ge 4$ corresponds to $\phi(1, 0, 0, \ldots, 0)$ with $n-1$ $0$'s.</p>

<p>Now we can finally relate this all to TREE(n).  TREE(n) is defined as the length of the longest sequence of trees $T_1, T_2, \ldots$ labelled from {1, 2, ..., n} such that, for all $i$, $T_i$ has at most $i$ vertices, and for all $i, j$ such that $i &lt; j$, there is no label-preserving homeomorphic embedding from $T_i$ into $T_j$.</p>

<p>TREE(1) is clearly 1.  The first tree can only be the unique one-vertex tree labelled with 1.  This tree obviously embeds into any other tree, so we are done at 1.</p>

<p>TREE(2) is 3.  The first tree can only be the unique one-vertex tree, labelled with either 1 or 2, it doesn't matter which. Say we label it with 1.  Then no remaining trees can use the label 1; all vertices must be labelled with 2.  The second tree can either be the unique one-vertex tree or the unique two-vertex tree.  If it is the former, we can have no more trees;  if it is the latter, the only tree that the two-vertex tree does not embed into is the one vertex tree, so it is the only choice for the third tree is the one-vertex tree, and again we are done.</p>

<p>So, so far we are not getting very long sequences!  But TREE(3) is a totally different kettle of fish.</p>

<p>Before we get to TREE(3), let's examine some smaller sequences that will build up towards it.</p>

<p>To describe a tree, I will use () to denote a vertex labelled with 1, and [] to denote a vertex labelled with 2.  The children of a vertex will be placed within the separators for the vertex; so for example</p>

<p>([][][])</p>

<p>means a vertex labelled with 1 with three children labelled with 2; and</p>

<p>[(()()) ()]</p>

<p>means a vertex labelled with 2 with two children labelled with 1; the left child has two children labelled with 1.</p>

<p>We will start by examining trees that are paths, with the root labelled with 2 and the rest of the vertices labelled with 1.</p>

<p>[]</p>

<p>(())</p>

<p>()</p>

<p>starting from a single vertex labelled with 2 leads to a sequence of length 3.</p>

<p>[()]</p>

<p>(()[])</p>

<p>((([])))</p>

<p>(([]))</p>

<p>([])</p>

<p>[]</p>

<p>(()()()()()()())</p>

<p>the last tree is the first tree in the sequence for tree(7) so we get a sequence of length greater than tree(7)</p>

<p>[(())]</p>

<p>(()[()])</p>

<p>((([()])))</p>

<p>(([()]))</p>

<p>([()])</p>

<p>[()]</p>

<p>(()()()()()()()[])</p>

<p>the last tree is the first tree in the sequence for tree(8), except the last vertex is labelled with a 2.  We can thus continue with a sequence of length tree(8) of trees with all but one vertex labelled with 1, finally ending in a tree consisting of one vertex labelled with 2.  The next tree is then a tree with more than tree(8) vertices with all vertices labelled with one;  this leads to a sequence of more than tree(tree(8)) vertices.</p>

<p>Continuing in this fashion, a path with one vertex labelled with 2 and n vertices labelled with 1 will lead to a sequence of more than tree$^n(n+6)$ trees.  If we define tree$_2 (n)$ to be tree$^n(n)$, then our lower bound is more than tree$_2 (n)$ trees.</p>

<p>Now consider a tree consisting of a path of length $n+1$ with the bottom vertex of the path having two children.  Again, the root will have label 2 and the rest of the vertices will have label 1.  For example, with n = 3 the tree is</p>

<p>[(((()())))]</p>

<p>We can construct a sequence of more than tree$_2 (n-1)$ trees by basically following the previous sequence, with the two children at the bottom added on.  This leads us to the tree [()()].  We follow that with the tree [(((...()...)))] with more than tree$_2 (n-1)$ vertices.  By our previous bound, we will wind up with a sequence of length greater than tree$_2$ (tree$_2 (n-1))$.</p>

<p>If we next consider a tree similar to the previous one, except we add a child to one of the two children at the bottom, we will get a lower bound of tree$_2$ (tree$_2$ (tree$_2 (n-1)))$.  If we add a path of length $m$ rather than a single child, we get a lower bound of tree$_2^{m+2}(n-1)$.  Define tree$_3 (n)$ to be tree$_2^n(n)$.  If $n \ge m+3$, we have a lower bound of tree$_3 (m)$.</p>

<p>Now we are ready to find a lower bound for TREE(3).  Start with:</p>

<p>{}  (one vertex with label 3)</p>

<p>[[]]</p>

<p>([][])</p>

<p>[()()()]</p>

<p>[(())(())]</p>

<p>[((()) ()) ()]</p>

<p>[(((()()))) ()]</p>

<p>[((((()()))()))]</p>

<p>((((()()))()))</p>

<p>((([(((()()))())])))</p>

<p>(([(((()()))())]))</p>

<p>([(((()()))())])</p>

<p>[(((()()))())]</p>

<p>(()()()()()()()[((()()))()])</p>

<p>this leads to a sequence of tree(8) trees, ending in</p>

<p>[((()()))()]</p>

<p>this is followed by</p>

<p>[<strong>(</strong>(()())()<strong>)</strong>]</p>

<p>where the <strong>(</strong> stands for tree(8) ('s and <strong>)</strong> stands for tree(8) )'s.</p>

<p>This leads to a sequence of tree$_2$ (tree(8)) trees, ending in</p>

<p>[(()())()]</p>

<p>This is followed by</p>

<p>[(<strong>(</strong> () <strong>)</strong>())]</p>

<p>where the <strong>(</strong> stands for tree$_2$ (tree(8)) ('s and <strong>)</strong> stands for tree$_2$ (tree(8)) )'s.</p>

<p>This leads to a sequence of more than tree$_3$ (tree$_2$ (tree(8))) trees.</p>

<p>Thus TREE(3) > tree$_3$ (tree$_2$ (tree(8))).</p>

<p>As you can imagine, the TREE(n) function clearly outpaces the tree(n) function, which is already at the level of the Small Veblen Ordinal in the fast-growing hierarchy.  This is not surprising, since labelled trees lead to more possibilities than unlabelled trees.</p>

"How do you compute negative numbers to fractional powers?","26733","","<p>My teachers have gone over rules for dealing with fractional exponents. I was just wondering how someone would compute say: $$(-5)^{2/3}$$ I have tried a couple ways to simplify this and I am not sure if the number stays negative or turns into a positive. I know that if a negative number is raised to an odd power it is negative, but fractional powers are neither odd or even. Is there a general rule for dealing with these types of problems? </p>
","<p>A negative base is a point of conflict between the three commonly used meanings of exponentiation.</p>

<ul>
<li>For the continuous real exponentiation operator, you're not allowed to have a negative base.</li>
<li>For the discrete real exponentiation operator, we allow fractional exponents with odd denominators, and
$$(-a)^{b/c} = \sqrt[c]{(-a)^b}= \left( \sqrt[c]{-a} \right)^b = (-1)^b a^{b/c} $$
(and this is allowed because every real number has a unique $c$-th root)</li>
<li>For the complex exponentiation operator, exponentiation is multivalued. An exponentiation with denominator $n$ generally takes on $n$ distinct values, although one is generally chosen as the ""principal"" value.</li>
</ul>

<p>For $(-5)^{2/3}$, these three exponentiation operators give</p>

<ul>
<li>Undefined</li>
<li>$\sqrt[3]{25}$</li>
<li>$\omega \sqrt[3]{25}$ is the principal value. The other two are $\sqrt[3]{25}$ and $\omega^2 \sqrt[3]{25}$, where $\omega = -\frac{1}{2} + \mathbf{i} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ is a cube root of $1$.</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, which meaning of exponentiation is meant is rarely ever stated explicitly, and has to be guessed from context.</p>

<p>I'm guessing that the second one is meant.</p>

<hr>

<p>In case you're curious, here is part of the rationale for the first and third conventions.</p>

<p>In the first convention, 'continuity' is important. If two exponents are 'near' each other, then they should produce 'nearby' values when used to exponentiate. However, despite the fact $2/3$, $3/5$, and $\pi/5$ are all similarish in size, $(-5)^{2/3}$ and $(-5)^{3/5}$ are widely separated by the fact one 'should' be positive and the other negative. And it's not even clear that $(-5)^{\pi/5}$ should be meaningful!</p>

<p>For the third convention, the whole thing is like the idea of $\pm 2$ being the 'square root of 4', but for the fact the complexes cannot be cleanly separated into ""negative"" and ""positive"" to let us choose a specific one nicely.</p>

<p>A method <em>is</em> chosen for the principal value, based trying to get positive bases 'right' and trying to keep continuity as much as possible, but alas this convention gets the negative bases 'wrong'.</p>

<p>In some sense, this can be viewed as the principal value of $(-5)^{2/3}$ chosen to be ""two-thirds of the way"" from positive to negative.</p>

We know that $gZ(G)=(xZ(G))^m$ for some $m$, and by definition $(xZ(G))^m=x^mZ(G)$. Now, in general, if $H\leq G$, we have by definition too that $aH=bH$ if and only if $b^{-1}a\in H$. In our case, we have that $gZ(G)=x^mZ(G)$, and this happens if and only if $(x^m)^{-1}g\in Z(G)$. There then exists a $z\in Z(G)$ such that $(x^{m})^{-1}g=z$, and so $g=x^mz$.

<p>""Neither John nor Mary are standing in front of either Jim or Cary""</p>

<p>~(Like(chocolate) $\vee$ Like(Vanilla))</p>

Both sentences use neither...nor, however in the second sentence I see no disjunction, but in the first it exists.</p>

<p>Any food for thought and help would be appreciated!</p>
","<p>Mathematically, there are two ways of ""translating"" ""I like neither chocolate nor vanilla"" (the two ways are logically equivalent, an instance of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_laws"" rel=""noreferrer"">de Morgan's laws</a>). You can write either:
$$\neg\bigl(\mathrm{like}(\mathrm{chocolate})\bigr)\ \&amp;\ \neg\bigl(\mathrm{like}(\mathrm{vanilla})\bigr)$$
(that is, ""I don't like chocolate and I don't like vanilla"") or as
$$\neg\bigl(\mathrm{like}(\mathrm{chocolate})\ \vee\ \mathrm{like}(\mathrm{vanilla})\bigr).$$
The two are equivalent, because $\neg(P\vee Q) \equiv (\neg P)\&amp;(\neg Q)$ (this is one of De Morgan's Laws: for ""P or Q"" to be false, you need <em>both</em> P to be false <strong>and</strong> Q to be false).</p>

<p>The second sentence is similar: ""Neither e nor a is to the right of c and to the left of b"".</p>

<p>You mention you are confused about it; I think it's just a confusion of parsing (it is a bit awkwardly constructed). What is says is ""Neither e nor a satisfy <code>xxxx</code>"". That is: ""e does not satisfy <code>xxxx</code>, and a does not satisfy <code>xxxx</code>"". What is this <code>xxxx</code>? It is the condition ""is to the right of c and to the left of b"". </p>

<p>So the sentence is the same as ""neither <code></code>e is to the right of c and to the left of b<code></code>, nor <code></code>a is to the right of c and to the left of b<code></code>."" (I added the grey spaces as parsing aides).</p>

<p>(Note that ""e is not to the right of c and to the left of b"" means that either e is not to the right of c, or e is not to the left of b, or both; same with a).</p>

<p>If you wanted to translate it in the same manner as the first translation above, with conjunction, you would have:
$$\Bigl(\neg\bigl(\mathrm{RightOf}(e,c)\&amp;\mathrm{LeftOf}(e,b)\bigr) \Bigr) \&amp; \Bigl(\neg\bigl(\mathrm{RightOf}(a,c)\&amp;\mathrm{LeftOf}(e,b)\bigr)\Bigr).$$
But you can equally as well use the model of the second translation above, to get the equivalent statement:
$$\neg\Biggl( \bigl(\mathrm{RightOf}(e,c)\&amp;\mathrm{LeftOf}(e,b)\bigr) \vee \bigl(\mathrm{Rightof}(a,c)\&amp;\mathrm{LeftOf}(a,b)\bigr)\Biggr).$$
So now you see the disjunction in the second.</p>

<p>The reason why the first ""translation"" of this phrase might be better than the second is that the mix of conjunctions and disjunctions ( ""(a and b) or (x and y)"" ) is usually a little harder to parse than a sequence of conjunctions, even with negations ( ""not(a and b) and not(x and y)""). So the latter form is slightly prefered for parsing reasons, but mathematically they are equivalent. The parsing problem does not show up in the vanilla/chocolate example, because there are no conjunctions hiding inside the clauses and complicating the parsing.</p>

<p>The easiest way to count the acceptable passwords is to note that there are $36^6$ six-character strings made up of upper-case letters and digits, and $26^6$ of them are made up entirely of letters, so there are $36^6-26^6$ that include at least one digit.</p>

<p>It is possible to count them directly, but the counting is more complicated. For each of the $6$ positions in the password there are $10\cdot36^5$ passwords having a digit in that position, so to a first approximation there are $6\cdot10\cdot36^5$ acceptable passwords. However, as noted in the first paragraph, this counts some passwords more than once. For each pair of positions in the password there are $10^2\cdot36^4$ passwords having digits in both of those positions, and all of these passwords have been counted twice. Since there are $\binom62$ pairs of positions, we must subtract $\binom62\cdot10^2\cdot36^4$ to get rid of the double-counting. Unfortunately, this overcompensates, and there are further corrections to be made.

<p>ONE STEP FURTHER:</p>

<p>How to find a upper triangular $U$ such that $A = U^T U$?</p>
","<p>This is an expansion of Arturo's comment.</p>

<p>The matrix has eigenvalues $50,25$, and eigenvectors $(4,3),(-3,4)$, so it eigendecomposes to $$A=\begin{pmatrix}4 &amp; -3 \\ 3 &amp; 4\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}50 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 25\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}4 &amp; -3 \\ 3 &amp; 4\end{pmatrix}^{-1}.$$</p>

<p>This is of the form $A=Q\Lambda Q^{-1}$. If this is $B^2$, then there will be a $B$ of the form $Q\Lambda^{1/2} Q^{-1}$ (square this to check this is formally true). A square root of a diagonal matrix is just the square roots of the diagonal entries, so we have</p>

<p>$$B=\begin{pmatrix}4 &amp; -3 \\ 3 &amp; 4\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}\sqrt{50} &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \sqrt{25}\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}4 &amp; -3 \\ 3 &amp; 4\end{pmatrix}^{-1}$$</p>

<p>$$=\frac{1}{5}\begin{pmatrix}9+16\sqrt{2} &amp; -12+12\sqrt{2} \\ -12+12\sqrt{2} &amp; 16+9\sqrt{2}\end{pmatrix}.$$</p>

<p>Here we used $\sqrt{50}=5\sqrt{2},\sqrt{25}=5$, and a quick formula for the inverse of a $2\times 2$ matrix:</p>

<p>$$\begin{pmatrix}a&amp;b\\c&amp;d\end{pmatrix}^{-1}=\frac{1}{ad-bc}\begin{pmatrix}d&amp;-b\\-c&amp;a\end{pmatrix}.$$</p>

<p>Keep in mind that matrix square roots are not unique (even up to sign), but this particular method is guaranteed to produce one example of a real matrix square root whenever $A$ has all positive eigenvalues.</p>

<hr>

<p>Finding an upper triangular $U$ such that $A=U^TU$ is even more straightforward:</p>

<p>$$A=\begin{pmatrix} a&amp;0 \\ b&amp;c \end{pmatrix} \cdot  \begin{pmatrix} a&amp;b \\ 0&amp;c \end{pmatrix} $$</p>

<p>This is $a^2=41$ hence $a=\sqrt{41}$, $ab=12$ hence $b=\frac{12}{41}\sqrt{41}$, and $b^2+c^2=34$ hence $c=25\sqrt{\frac{2}{41}}$.</p>

<p>In other words,</p>

<p>$$U=\sqrt{41}\begin{pmatrix}1&amp;\frac{12}{41}\\0&amp;\frac{25}{41}\sqrt{2}\end{pmatrix}. $$</p>

"What books do you recommend before 'Concrete Mathematics'?","26401","","<p>What book(s) do you recommend before <em>Concrete Mathematics</em>? </p>

<p>Is something like ""Introduction to discrete Mathematics"" enough?</p>
","<p>It would help to know what math classes you've covered thus far.  Knowing some basics in calculus will certainly help. From one of your comments below your question, it seems as though you haven't had any calculus, it would be good to cover some of the material typically covered in a calculus survey course, or 1st semester calculus.  Spivak's <em>Calculus</em> was one of the recommended texts; you could also learn calculus, or supplement your study of a text, with on-line video-lectures and tutoring: I highly recommend that you visit <a href=""http://www.khanacademy.org/?video=simple-differential-equation-example#calculus""><strong>The Khan Academy</strong></a> website: everything offered on the site is free, and it has built a great deal of credibility (e.g. Bill Gates has offered to sponsor the site.) Not only does the site offer lessons and exercises in calculus; it also covers geometry, trigonometry, and algebra. It is very extensive and a good resource for ""brushing up"" on previous learning too.</p>

<p>Now, from my take of the preface to <em>Concrete Mathematics</em> (see link to the book's preface below), the book was, by design, written to make the content accessible to a ""wider audience (including [college] sophomores)"", and hence, doesn't seem to assume any intensive background in college math. So, I think you could probably ""jump right into"" the book; if you do encounter any difficulties along the way, the book has an extensive bibliography to which you can refer, or a quick web search (Google, Wikipedia, MathWorld, etc.) of the topic causing you problems will turn up lots of resources to help you out.</p>

<p>However, if you are really unsure of your capacity to master <em>Concrete Mathematics</em> at this point in time, then by all means, prepare using some of the suggestions cited here. Discrete math might provide some preparation prior to reading <em>Concrete Mathematics</em>, but it seems to me that the relevant content from discrete mathematics is covered in the text.  It certainly wouldn't <em>hurt</em> to study discrete mathematics (perhaps take a look at Kenneth Rosen's <em>Discrete Mathematics and its Applications</em>); it all depends on the time-frame you have available, your level of commitment, your capacity to stay focused, and the confidence you have in your abilities. </p>

<p>The Logic table for <code>If P then Q</code> is as follows:</p>

<p>What I don't understand is, How can there be a truth table for this?</p>

<p>As far as I understand, If p then Q means ""<em>if P is true, Q has to be true. Any other case, I don't know</em>"" </p>

<p>So, from what I understand, the first 2 rows of the truth table state that ""<em>If P is true and Q is true, the outcome is correct and If P is true and Q is false, the outcome is incorrect (F)""</em></p>

<p>What about the last 2 rows?</p>
","<p>Think of the truth table as describing when the statement ""If $P$ then $Q$"" is true. If $P$ is false, then the statement ""If $P$ then $Q$"" doesn't claim anything, so how could it be false? Since it doesn't claim anything, we make the convention that ""If $P$ then $Q$"" should be true.</p>

<p>One could argue that if ""If $P$ then $Q$"" doesn't claim anything, then how could it be true either? Well, we accept a basic axiom of logic that tell us that every statement is either true or false, so we have to pick one. In mathematics, we find it more useful to take it to be true, but this is not necessary. Often times in Philosophy one takes the opposite convention. This may be confusing as far as notation goes, but it does not actually cause any problems.</p>

<p>What's an easy way to show that the average percentage increase of <em>n</em> numbers will not equal the total percentage increase of the before/after summed <em>n</em> numbers? Yes, one could work out an example but it still doesn't make it apparently clear.</p>

Average %   = (% Sum)/ # of %'s

            = 1.833

Total % 
Increase    = (Final Sum - Inital Sum) / (Initial Sum) * 100
            = (33.62 - 33)/33 * 100
            = 1.87879
</pre>

<p>These percentages are close but not the same. My intuition tells me this is correct but I would like to develope a proof to show this is <em>actually</em> true.</p>

<p>Any help/guidance would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>-- Edit 1 --</strong></p>

<p>My question contains an incorrect premise. I shouldn't be using the <em>average</em> of the percentages. Rather, I should be using the weighted average.</p>

<p>Using Excel and <a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/kb/214049"">this example</a> I was able to generate the total percent increase using the all the percentages.</p>

<p>A proof would still be helpful in understanding the problem.</p>

<p><strong>-- Edit 2 --</strong></p>

<p>Given initial values $a_k$ and percentages $p_k$, the weighted average for the percentages would be:
$$ 
\frac{\sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k *p_k}{\sum_{k=1}^{n}p_k}
$$</p>

<p>Hopefully that's the correct notation. Like I stated in Edit 1, that was pulled from <a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/kb/214049"">How to calculate weighted averages in Excel</a>.</p>
","<p>Perhaps the easiest way to see what’s going on is to look at an extreme case. Suppose that you start with just two initial values, $10$ and $1000$, and increase one of them by $10$% while leaving the other unchanged. The average of the two percentage increases is $\frac12(10+0)=5$% no matter which of the two numbers you increased. The percentage increase in the total, however, very clearly depends on which of the two was increased: increasing the $10$ by $10$% increases the total by $1$, from $1010$ to $1011$, but increasing the $1000$ by $10$% increases the total by $100$, from $1010$ to $1110$. Clearly the latter is a much larger percentage increase than the former; the actual figures are about $0.099$% in the first case and about $9.9$% in the second.</p>

<p>The point is that when you increase one of the items by a certain percentage, the effect on the total depends not only on the percentage, but also on the size of the item. </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> And that’s exactly why your weighted averages work: the individual percentage increases need to be weighted by the sizes of the original items. Let the original amounts be $a_1,\dots,a_n$, and let the percentage increases, expressed as fractions, be $p_1,\dots,p_n$. The amounts after the increase are $a_k(1+p_k)=a_k+a_kp_k$ for $k=1,\dots,n$, so the the total increase is $$a_1p_1+a_2p_2+\cdots+a_np_n\;.$$ Let $A=a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_n$ be the original total; then the fractional increase is</p>

<p>$$\frac{a_1p_1+a_2p_2+\cdots+a_np_n}A=\frac{a_1}Ap_1+\cdots+\frac{a_n}Ap_n\;,$$</p>

<p>which is indeed the weighted mean of the percentages when they are weighted by the relative sizes of the original amounts.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2vv4i.gif"" alt=""Wolfram Alpha&#39;s answer""></p>

<p>I am lost upon how this was obtained.  </p>
","<p>This will give you somewhat of an idea on how to calculate the inverse of your cubic equation$ x^3-5x+3x+c$. We are not going to use $c$ but use an actual number say $10$ for  $x^3-5x+3x+10$ for simplicity. Presented below will be a sequence of quick and dirty Sage program instructions that you can paste into the Sage Open Source Mathematics Software <a href=""http://www.sagemath.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sage</a> online version if you care to. Sage can be Out of Service from time to time so if you can’t get on go back later. As stated in other answers it ends up being essentially the same as calculating the root of the cubic equation using the Cardano method. As you can find the inverse of a quadratic equation as follows</p>

<p>$$y = ax^2 + bx + c$$</p>

<p>$$ax^2 + bx + (c - y) = 0$$</p>

<p>$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4a(c-y)}}{2a}$$</p>

<p>You can do the same with the cubic equation with $$ax^3+bx^2+cx+(d-y) = 0$$</p>

<p>but it involves more computation. </p>

<p>First evaluate the following Sage code after pasting into Sage ($a,b,c,d$ are the coefficients) Put the cubic polynomial in monic form also:</p>

<pre><code>   var('y,x')
   a=1
   b=(-5)
   c=(3)
   d=(10-x)
   u=a*(y-(b/3*a))^3+b*(y-(b/3*a))^2+c*(y-(b/3*a))+d
   show(u)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note: After pasting all the Sage code listed herein into Sage make sure that all the code is lined up on the left edge before evaluating otherwise it will not produce good results. Or, you could just type it.</strong></p>

<p>The above formula $u$ is the following 
$$a\left(y-\frac{b}{3a}\right)^3+ b\left(y-\frac{b}{3a}\right)^2+c\left(y-\frac{b}{3a}\right)+d$$</p>

<p>which you can see on <a href=""http://www.sosmath.com/algebra/factor/fac11/fac11.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Cubic Formula</a>. The result should be the following:</p>

<p>$$\frac{1}{27}(3y + 5)^3 - \frac{5}{9}(3y + 5)^2 + 3y + 15-x$$</p>

<p>This will allow us to “depress” the cubic equation with the following command to be run sequentially after pasting the code into Sage.</p>

<pre><code>    var('y,x')
    expand(u)
</code></pre>

<p>The result should be the following:
$$y^3 - \frac{16}{3}y + \frac{155}{27}-x$$</p>

<p>From the above ""depressed"" cubic equation you can plug in $p$ and $q$ as noted in the Sage code below. Since we want the inverse of the cubic we are subtracting an $x$ from $\frac{155}{27}$ as $q$. Paste the following into Sage and evaluate.</p>

<pre><code>    p=(-16/3)
    q=((155/27)-x)
    t=((-q/2)+((p/3)^3+(q/2)^2)^(1/2))^(1/3)+((-q/2)-((p/3)^3+(q/2)^2)^(1/2))^(1/3)
    z=t
    show(z)
</code></pre>

<p>$t$ in the above formula is the following which you can check on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_function"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cubic Function</a></p>

<p>$$\sqrt[3]{-\frac{q}{2}+ \sqrt{\frac{q^2}{ 4}+\frac{p^3}{ 27}}} +\sqrt[3]{-\frac{q}{ 2}- \sqrt{\frac{q^2}{ 4}+\frac{p^3}{ 27}}}$$</p>

<p>This will give you the following result. The only difference in the computation of the inverse and of the roots is the addition of the “-x”  to $q$ in the above</p>

<p>$$\sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{2}x - \sqrt{\frac{1}{2916}(27x - 155)^2 - \frac{4096}{729}} - \frac{155}{54}} + \sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{2}x + \sqrt{\frac{1}{2916}(27x - 155)^2 - \frac{4096}{729}} - \frac{155}{54}}$$</p>

<p>All you have to do is add the fraction $-\frac{b}{3a}$ which in this case is $\frac{5}{3}$ to get the inverse function</p>

<p>$$\sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{2}x - \sqrt{\frac{1}{2916}(27x - 155)^2 - \frac{4096}{729}} - \frac{155}{54}} + \sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{2}x + \sqrt{\frac{1}{2916}(27x - 155)^2 - \frac{4096}{729}} - \frac{155}{54}} + \frac{5}{3}$$</p>

<p>This result does not look identical to the result from Wolfram Alpha but it does the same thing. As a verification you can take out the $show(z)$ command in the code and replace it with just $z$ then copy and paste the formula into Excel with the result of $x^3-5x^2+3x+10$ as the input value for $x$ in the inverse formula to see if it works. In other words does the output of $f(x)=x^3-5x^2+3x+10$ when plugged in as the input of the inverse function equals the input of $f(x)$. There could be situations where it will not compute correctly. For example in the case where $x=4$ we would expect the inverse function to produce the value $2$ in Excel. This does not occur because the inverse function produces the following with $4$ as the input.</p>

<p>$$\sqrt[3]{-\frac{5}{6}i\sqrt{7}-\frac{47}{54}}+\sqrt[3]{\frac{5}{6}i\sqrt{7}-\frac{47}{54}}+\frac{5}{3}$$</p>

<p>This will not compute to a real number in programs such as Excel since they cannot make computations in complex numbers. So in order to get $2$ as the output the combination of cube roots of the above cubic radicals that produces $2$ is the following:</p>

<p>$$\left(\frac{1}{6}+\frac{i\sqrt{7}}{2}\right)+\left(\frac{1}{6}-\frac{i\sqrt{7}}{2}\right)+\frac{5}{3}=2$$</p>

<p>The complex numbers in parentheses are one of the cube roots of the above cubic radical expressions.
For examples of how to find cube roots of these types of nested radicals see <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/16331/how-to-check-if-a-quadratic-surd-is-a-perfect-cube"">16331</a>.</p>

"The Mathematics of Tetris","26125","","<p>I am a big fan of the oldschool games and I once noticed that there is a sort parity associated to one and only one Tetris piece, the $\color{purple}{\text{T}}$ piece.  This parity is found with no other piece in the game.</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong> The Tetris playing field has width $10$.  Rotation is allowed, so there are then exactly $7$ unique pieces, each of which is composed of $4$ blocks.</p>

<p>For convenience, we can name each piece by a letter.  See this <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris#Colors_of_Tetriminos"">Wikipedia page for the Image</a> ($\color{cyan}{\text{I}}$ is for the stick piece, $\color{goldenrod}{\text{O}}$ for the square, and $\color{green}{\text{S}},\color{purple}{\text{T}},\color{red}{\text{Z}},\color{orange}{\text{L}},\color{blue}{\text{J}}$ are the others)</p>

<p>There are $2$ sets of $2$ pieces which are mirrors of each other, namely $\color{orange}{\text{L}}, \color{blue}{\text{J}}$ and $\color{green}{\text{S}},\color{red}{\text{Z}}$ whereas the other three are symmetric $\color{cyan}{\text{I}},\color{goldenrod}{\text{O}}, \color{purple}{\text{T}}$</p>

<p><strong>Language:</strong> If a row is completely full, that row disappears.  We call it a <strong>perfect clear</strong> if no blocks remain in the playing field.  Since the blocks are size 4, and the playing field has width $10$, the number of blocks for a perfect clear must always be a multiple of $5$.</p>

<p><strong>My Question:</strong>  I noticed while playing that the $\color{purple}{\text{T}}$ piece is particularly special.  It seems that it has some sort of parity which no other piece has.  Specifically:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Conjecture</strong>:  If we have played some number of pieces, and we have a perfect clear, then the number of $\color{purple}{\text{T}}$ pieces used must be even.  Moreover, the $\color{purple}{\text{T}}$ piece is the only piece with this property.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have verified the second part; all of the other pieces can give a perfect clear with either an odd or an even number used.  However, I am not sure how to prove the first part.  I think that assigning some kind of invariant to the pieces must be the right way to go, but I am not sure.</p>

<p>Thank you,</p>
","<p>My colleague, Ido Segev, pointed out that there is a problem with most of the elegant proofs here - Tetris is not just a problem of tiling a rectangle.</p>

<p>Below is his proof that the conjecture is, in fact, false.</p>

"chance on throwing a six with 6 dice","26124","","<p>The chance to throw a 6 with one die is 1/6</p>

","<p>With $6$ dice there are $6^6$ possible outcomes. Of these, $5^6$ don't lead to six on any of the dice. So the number of outcomes that lead to at least one six are $6^6-5^6$, so the probability of at least one six is $\frac{6^6-5^6}{6^6} \approx 0.6651$</p>

"What does the semicolon ; mean in a function definition","26117","","<p>Cauchy's Hypothesis or Noll's theorem states that $\vec{t}(\vec{X},t;\partial \Omega) = \vec{t}(\vec{X},t;\vec{N})$ where $\vec{N}$ is the outward unity normal to the positively oriented surface $\partial \Omega$. This translates to words as the dependence of the surface interaction vector on the surface on which it acts is only through the normal $\vec{N}$.

","<p>There is no hard mathematical difference between the comma (,) and the semicolon(;).</p>

","<p>I think I found an easier solution for this specific problem without complicating it too much.</p>

<p>We have one basic kind of triangle, and that is the one that our big triangle contains 4 of. Let's call that order 1.</p>

<p>If we count the triangles inside order 1, we find out that they are 16. They are not so many so we can actually count them manually.</p>

<p>So long we have 16 triangles times 4, 64 triangles.</p>

<p>Now by combining 4 order-1 triangles we get new triangles that originate from the combination.</p>

<p>Lets count the new triangles for ONE side only. Be careful because some of them can be mirrored and some cannot. Actually there is only one that cannot be mirrored.</p>

<p>That gives us 13 new triangles for ONE side only from the combination of order 1 into order 2.</p>

<p>Now we have 13 more for every time we turn the big triangle around. So now we have:</p>

<p>Can this be done or do we think I went wrong somewhere?</p>
","<p>Matrices form a vector space. Therefore, you can simply integrate them componentwise. </p>

<p>In detail. Let $A:t\mapsto A(t)$ be a function from a real interval $I$ to the space of $m\times n$ real matrices. 
Every entry $a_{ij}$ is a real function of a real variable. If all entries are integrable functions, then you can define the integral of the matrix as the matrix of the integrals:</p>

<p>$$\int A(t)\,dt := \left( \int a_{ij}(t)\,dt \right).$$</p>

<p>For your problem:</p>

<p>$$\int  \begin{pmatrix}\sin(s)&amp;\cos(\beta s)\\ \cos(s)&amp;\cos(\beta s)\end{pmatrix}ds = 
\begin{pmatrix}\int\sin(s)\,ds &amp;\int\cos(\beta s)\,ds\\ \int\cos(s)\,ds&amp;\int\cos(\beta s)\,ds\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}-\cos(s)&amp;\frac{1}{\beta}\sin(\beta s)\\ \sin(s)&amp;\frac{1}{\beta}\sin(\beta s)\end{pmatrix}. $$</p>

<p>There is a more sophisticated operation, in case the matrix in question belongs to a Lie algebra: ordered exponentiation. It is to integration as exponentiation is to multiplication, and permits to go from a Lie algebra element (intuitively, a differential transformation) to a group element (a whole transformation). 
In this case, you need a $n\times n$ matrix-valued function.</p>

<p>In general, if $\alpha_{1}$, $\alpha_{2}$, $\alpha_{3},\ldots,\alpha_{n}$ are the roots of the equation $p_{0}x^n + p_{1} x^{n-1} + p_{2}x^{n-2} + \cdots + p_{n-1}x + p_{n} = 0$ where ($p_{0}\neq0$) then </p>

<p>sum of the roots $= \frac{-p_{1}}{p_{0}}$</p>

<p>sum of products of the roots, two at a time $= \frac{p_{2}}{p_{0}}$</p>

<p>sum of products if the roots, three at a time $= \frac{-p_{3}}{p_{0}}$</p>

<p>sum of products of the roots, $n$ at a time = $(-1)^n,\frac{p_{n}}{p}_{0}$</p>

<p>I was able to understand the cubic equation's part but I am completely lost with the general part (i.e an $n$th degree polynomial). I am looking for a simpler explanation of what that means. However I understand that it can be used as formulas for finding the roots but i need to know how did he obtain the above formulas.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
","<p>The Factor Theorem says that if a polynomial $p(x)$ has root $r$, then $x-r$ divides $p(x)$. </p>

<p>Since polynomial with complex coefficients always have exactly the same number of roots as its degree (counting multiplicity), and they have unique factorization, that means that if $p(x)$ is the polynomial
$$x^n + p_1x^{n-1} + \cdots + p_{n-1}x + p_0$$
(note that I am doing the monic case first; I'll deal with the general case later) and $r_1,\ldots,r_n$ are the roots of $p(x)$, then we can factor $p(x)$ as
$$p(x) = x^n + p_1x^{n-1}+\cdots + p_{n-1}x + p_0 = (x-r_1)(x-r_2)\cdots(x-r_n).$$</p>

<p>When you multiply out  $(x-r_1)\cdots(x-r_n)$, and then put together the powers of $x$, you get a polynomial expression in which the coefficients are written in terms of the roots. For example, to get the coefficient of $x$, note that you will get an $x$ when you expand and multiply the $x$ in the first binomial by each of the constants in the rest, giving you $(-1)^{n-1}(r_2\cdots r_n)x$. Another when you multiply the $x$ in the second binomial by each of the constants in the rest; another when you multiply the $x$ in the third binomial by the constants in the rest; etc.</p>

<p>If you work this out, you'll find that when you expand $(x-r_1)\cdots(x-r_n)$ and then group together the powers of $x$, you will have:</p>

<ul>
<li>The coefficient of $x^n$ is $1$.</li>
<li>The coefficient of $x^{n-1}$ is $-(r_1+\cdots + r_n)$.</li>
<li>The coefficient of $x^{n-2}$ is $$r_1r_2 + r_1r_3 + \cdots +r_1r_n + r_2r_3+\cdots + r_{n-1}r_n.$$</li>
<li>The coefficient of $x^{n-3}$ is $$-\bigl(r_1r_2r_3 + r_1r_2r_4+\cdots + r_1r_2r_n + r_1r_3r_4 + \cdots + r_{n-2}r_{n-1}r_n\bigr).$$</li>
<li>$\vdots$</li>
<li>The coefficient of $x$ is $$(-1)^{n-1}\bigl(r_1r_2\cdots r_{n-1} + r_1r_2\cdots r_{n-2}r_n +\cdots + r_2\cdots r_n\bigr).$$</li>
<li>The constant coefficient is $$(-1)^n\bigl(r_1\cdots r_n\bigr).$$</li>
</ul>

<p>But for two polynomials to be equal they have to be equal coefficient by coefficient. So that means that:
$$\begin{align*}
p_1 &amp;= (-1)^1\bigl( r_1+\cdots + r_n\bigr)\\
p_2 &amp;= (-1)^2\bigl( r_1r_2+r_1r_3+\cdots + r_1r_n + r_2r_3+\cdots + r_{n-1}r_n\bigr)\\
p_3 &amp;= (-1)^3\bigl( r_1r_2r_3 + r_1r_2r_4+\cdots + r_1r_2r_n + r_1r_3r_4+\cdots + r_{n-2}r_{n-1}r_n\bigr)\\
&amp;\vdots\\
p_n &amp;= (-1)^n\bigl(r_1\cdots r_n\bigr).
\end{align*}$$
That is: </p>

<ul>
<li>The sum of the roots is $-p_1$;</li>
<li>The sum of all products of two roots is $(-1)^2p_2$;</li>
<li>The sum of all products of three roots is $(-1)^3p_3$;</li>
<li>The sum of all products of four roots is $(-1)^4p_4$;</li>
<li>$\vdots$</li>
<li>The sum of all products of $n-1$ roots is $(-1)^{n-1}p_{n-1}$;</li>
<li>The product of all roots is $(-1)^np_n$.</li>
</ul>

<p>Which is what the text you cite says.</p>

<p>How about a polynomial that is not monic,
$$p(x) = p_0x^n + p_1x^{n-1}+\cdots + p_{n-1}x + p_n,\qquad p_0\neq 0\ ?$$</p>

<p>Note that $r$ is a root of $p(x)$ if and only if it is a root of
$$P(x) = \frac{1}{p_0}p(x) = x^n + \frac{p_1}{p_0}x^{n-1} + \cdots + \frac{p_{n-1}}{p_0}x + \frac{p_n}{p_0}.$$
So the argument above applies to $P(x)$. </p>

<p>How do I find the distance between two points on a parabola?</p>

<p>Like, if I have y=x^2, how do I find out how much actual line is between say, (4,16) and (2,4)? If you use the normal line distance thing, it tells you how much space is between each point, but not how much of the actual parabola is between the points.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
","<p>If you have a curve $y=f(x)$, the length of the curve between points $(x_1,f(x_1))$ and $(x_2,f(x_2))$ is given by
$$L(x_1,x_2) = \int_{x_1}^{x_2} \sqrt{(dx)^2 + (df(x))^2} = \int_{x_1}^{x_2}\sqrt{1+\left(\dfrac{df}{dx} \right)^2} dx$$
In your case, $f(x) = x^2$. Hence, $\dfrac{df}{dx} = 2x$. Hence, the length of curve between the points $(x_1,x_1^2)$ and $(x_2,x_2^2)$ is
$$L(x_1,x_2) = \int_{x_1}^{x_2} \sqrt{1+(2x)^2} dx = \int_{x_1}^{x_2} \sqrt{1+4x^2} dx$$

"Best Book For Differential Equations?","25874","","<p>I know this is a subjective question, but  I need some opinions on a very good book for learning differential equations. </p>

<p>Ideally it should have a variety of problems with worked solutions and be easy to read. </p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","<p>I really loved <em>Differential Equations With Applications and Historical Notes</em> by George Simmons.  It drastically changed my outlook about a large part of mathematics.  For example, why do we spend so much time in real analysis studying convergence of power series? The subject is interesting on its own, but aside from the abstract interest, it's ultimately because we want to use those methods to understand power series solutions of differential equations.  </p>

<p>The Simmons book is clearly written, and it not only makes the subject
interesting but deeply fascinating. Great mathematicians like Gauss and Laplace were trying to solve problems of physics and engineering, in which differential equations are ubiquitous, and these problems are the primary motivation for a large part of analysis and topology. By page 30 Simmons has
treated falling objects with air resistance and shown how to calculate
terminal velocities. After spending all of high school doing falling-objects problems without air resistance, it was a relief to finally do them right.
Another early highlight is the solution of the famous <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachistochrone_problem"">brachistochrone problem</a>, something I had been wondering for years.</p>

<p>Many books have a series of dry exercises of the sort “Solve the equation … using the … method.”  Simmons' exercises are juicy.
It was fun just to read them, and each one got me excited to try
to find out the answer.  Here are some examples, all from chapter 1:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li><p>Consider a bead at the highest part of a circle in a vertical
      plane, and let that point be joined to any lower point on the
      circle by a straight wire, If the bead slides down the wire
      without friction, show that it will reach the circle in the
      same time regardless of the position of the lower point.</p></li>
  <li><p>A chain 4 feet long starts with 1 foot hanging over the edge
      of a table.  Neglect friction, and find the time for the chain
      to slide off the table.</p></li>
  <li><p>A smooth football having the shape of a prolate spheroid 12
      inches long and 6 inches thick is lying outdoors in a
      rainstorm.  Find the paths along which the water will run down
      its sides.</p></li>
  <li><p>The clepsydra, or ancient water clock, was a bowl from which
      water was allowed to escape through a small hole in the
      bottom.  It was often used in Greek and Roman courts to time
      the speeches of lawyers, in order to keep them from talking
      too much.  Find the shape it should have if the water level is
      to fall at a constant rate.</p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>This one might be my favorite:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>A destroyer is hunting a submarine in a dense fog.  The fog
      lifts for a moment, discloses the submarine on the surface 3
      miles away, and immediately descends.  The speed of the
      destroyer is twice that of the submarine, and it is known that
      the latter will at once dive and depart at full speed in a
      straight course of unknown direction.  What path should the
      destroyer follow to be certain of passing directly over the
      submarine?  Hint: Establish a polar coordinate system with the
      origin at the point where the submarine was sighted.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I wouldn't even have realized that there <em>was</em> such a path, and I had
to ponder for a while to persuade myself that there was.</p>

<p>The differential equations class I took as a youth was disappointing,
because it seemed like little more than a bag of tricks that would
work for a few equations, leaving the vast majority of interesting
problems insoluble.  Simmons' book fixed that.  </p>

","<p>Suppose $G$ is disconnected. We want to show that $\bar{G}$ is connected. So suppose $v$ and $w$ are vertices. If $vw$ is not an edge in $G$, then it is an edge in $\bar{G}$, and so we have a path from $v$ to $w$ in $\bar{G}$. On the other hand, if $vw$ <em>is</em> an edge in $G$, then this means $v$ and $w$ are in the same component of $G$. Since $G$ is disconnected, we can find a vertex $u$ in a different component, so that neither $uv$ nor $uw$ are edges of $G$. Then $vuw$ is a parth from $v$ to $w$ in $\bar{G}$.</p>

<p>This shows that any two vertices in $\bar{G}$ have a path (in fact a path of length one or two) between them in $\bar{G}$, so $\bar{G}$ is connected.</p>

<p>There is clearly a lot more going on here; I hope a number theorist will come and explain what is really going on.
I will be sloppy about convergence issues.</p>

<p>Set 
$$S:= \sum_{k,n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{k+n}}{k^2+4kn+n^2}.$$
We set $m = k+2n$, in order to diagonalize the quadratic form:
$$S = \sum_{0 &lt; 2n &lt; m} \frac{(-1)^{m-n}}{m^2 - 3 n^2}.$$
It turns out to be more elegant to work with
$$T : = \sum_{0 \leq 2n &lt; m} \frac{(-1)^{m-n}}{m^2 - 3 n^2} = S + \sum_{m=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^m}{m^2} = S - \frac{\pi^2}{12}.$$</p>

<p>Let $R$ be the ring $\ZZ[\sqrt{3}]$. Let $D \subset R$ be $\{ m+n\sqrt{3} :  0 \leq 2n &lt; m \}$. So, simply as a matter of formal rewriting
$$T = \sum_{m+n \sqrt{3} \in D} \frac{(-1)^{m+n}}{m^2-3 n^2}.$$</p>

<p>We will now try to interpret each of these quantities in terms of the ring $R$. Recall that, for $m+n \sqrt{3} \in R$, the norm $N(m+n \sqrt{3})$ is $m^2 - 3 n^2$.
Define $R_{+} = \{ a \in R : N(a) &gt; 0\}$ and $R_{-} = \{ a \in R : N(a) &lt; 0 \}$. </p>

<p>For $m+n \sqrt{3} \in R$, define $\sigma_2(m+n \sqrt{3}) = (-1)^{m+n}$.</p>

<p>Let $\Gamma$ denote the unit group of $R$. Explicitly, $\Gamma$ is $\{ \pm 1 \} \times (2+\sqrt{3})^{\ZZ}$. </p>

<p>Note that multiplication by $\Gamma$ takes $R_{+}$ and $R_{-}$ to themselves. Here is the first miracle: $D$ is a fundamental domain for the action of $\Gamma$ on $R_{+}$! For example, multiplication by $2+\sqrt{3}$ maps the ray $\RR_{\geq 0} (1+0 \sqrt{3})$ bounding one side of $D$ to the ray $\RR_{\geq 0} (2+\sqrt{3})$ on the other side. Moreover, multiplication by units leaves $N( \ )$ and $\sigma_2(\ )$ unchanged. 
So we can view the sum as
$$T = \sum_{a \in R_{+}/\Gamma} \frac{\sigma_2(a)}{N(a)}$$
where the sum means to pick one representative for each orbit of the $\Gamma$ action.</p>

<p>I'd rather sum over $R$ than $R_{+}$. Define $\chi_{\infty}$ to be $\pm 1$ on $R_{\pm}$. So we can rewrite 
$$ T = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{a \in R_{\neq 0}/\Gamma} \frac{\sigma_2(a) \left( 1+\chi_{\infty}(a) \right)}{|N(a)|} = \frac{1}{2}\left(  \sum_{a \in R_{\neq 0}/\Gamma} \frac{\sigma_2(a)}{|N(a)|} + \sum_{a \in R_{\neq 0}/\Gamma} \frac{\sigma_2(a) \chi_{\infty}(a)}{|N(a)|}  \right) = : \frac{1}{2} (U+V).$$</p>

<p>Now, $a$ and $b$ in $R$ are in the same $\Gamma$ orbit if and only if the ideals $(a)$ and $(b)$ are equal. So the above sums are running over all principal ideals of $R$.
Moreover, $R$ is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_number_fields_with_class_number_one"" rel=""noreferrer"">PID</a>! And, finally, for a principal ideal $I = (a)$, we have $N(I) = |N(a)|$. So we can write:
$$U = \sum_{I \subset R \ \mbox{an ideal}} \frac{\sigma_2(I)}{N(I)} \quad V = \sum_{I \subset R \ \mbox{an ideal}} \frac{\sigma_2(I) \chi_{\infty}(I)}{N(I)} .$$
We set
$$U(s) = \sum_{I \subset R \ \mbox{an ideal}} \frac{\sigma_2(I)}{N(I)^s} \quad V(s) = \sum_{I \subset R \ \mbox{an ideal}} \frac{\sigma_2(I) \chi_{\infty}(I)}{N(I)^s} .$$</p>

<p>Note that $\sigma_2(a)$ is $1$ if and only if $1+\sqrt{3}$ divides $a$.
So we have the Euler factorization
$$U(s) = \left(-1 + 2^{-s} + 2^{-2s} + 2^{-3s} +  \cdots \right) \prod_{\pi \neq (1+\sqrt{3})} \frac{1}{1-N(\pi)^{-s}} =$$
$$\frac{-1+2^{-s}+2^{-2s}+ 2^{-3s} + \cdots}{1+2^{-s}+2^{-2s}+2^{-3s}+\cdots} \prod_{\pi}  \frac{1}{1-N(\pi)^{-s}} =(-1+2\cdot 2^{-s}) \zeta_R(s).$$
where $\pi$ runs over prime ideals of $R$.</p>

<p>So
$$\lim_{s \to 1^{+}} U(s) = \lim_{s \to 1^{+}} \frac{-1+2 \cdot 2^{-s}}{s-1} \lim_{s \to 1^{+}} (s-1) \zeta_R(s) = - \log 2  \lim_{s \to 1^{+}} (s-1) \zeta_R(s).$$
From the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_number_formula"" rel=""noreferrer"">class number formula</a>, this last limit is
$$\frac{2^2 \log (2+\sqrt{3})}{2 \cdot \sqrt{12}}.$$
So
$$U(1) = - \frac{\log 2 \log(2+\sqrt{3})}{\sqrt{3}}.$$</p>

<p>We now run the same trick with $V$. Again, we start with the Euler product:
$$V(s) =  \left(-1 - 2^{-s} + 2^{-2s} - 2^{-3s} + 2^{-4s} -  \cdots \right) \prod_{\pi \neq (1+\sqrt{3})} \frac{1}{1-\chi_{\infty}(\pi) N(\pi)^{-s}} =$$
$$\frac{-1 - 2^{-s} + 2^{-2s} - 2^{-3s} +2^{-4s} -  \cdots}{1-2^{-s} + 2^{-2s} - 2^{-3s} + 2^{-4s} -  \cdots} \prod_{\pi} \frac{1}{1-\chi_{\infty}(\pi) N(\pi)^{-s}} = 
\left( -1 - 2^{1-s} \right)   L(s, \chi_{\infty}).$$</p>

<p>So
$$V = V(1) = - 2 L(1, \chi_{\infty}).$$</p>

<p>We now must evaluate $L(1, \chi_{\infty})$. This $L$-function is defined by a sum over the ideals of $R$; we will rewrite it in terms of $L$-functions for $\ZZ$. 
Let $p \geq 5$ be prime. I claim that $p$ splits in $R$ if and only if $p \equiv \pm 1 \bmod 12$. For such a $p$, if we write $p = \pi \bar{\pi}$, I claim that $N(\pi) = N(\bar{\pi}) = p$ if $p \equiv 1 \bmod 12$ and $N(\pi) = N(\bar{\pi}) = -p$ if $p \equiv -1 \bmod 12$. <b>Proof Sketch:</b> The prime $p$ splits in $R$ if and only if $\left( \frac{3}{p} \right) = 1$, which is easily computed to be equivalent to $p \equiv \pm 1 \bmod 12$. Since $R$ is a PID, we can write such a $p$ as $\pi \bar{\pi}$ for $\pi$ and $\bar{\pi} \in R$. Then $N(\pi) = N(\bar{\pi}) = \pm p$. But, for $a=m+n \sqrt{3} \in R$, we have $N(a) = m^2-3 n^2 \not \equiv -1 \mod 3$. So only one of the two possibilities for $\pm p$ can occur. $\square$</p>

<p>So $L(1, \chi_{\infty})$ is
$$\left(1+2^{-1} \right)^{-1} \left( 1+3^{-1} \right)^{-1} \prod_{p \equiv 1 \bmod 12} \left( 1- p^{-1} \right)^{-2} \prod_{p \equiv -1 \bmod 12}  \left( 1+ p^{-1} \right)^{-2} \prod_{p \equiv \pm 5 \bmod 12} \left( 1- p^{-2} \right)^{-1}.$$</p>

<p>Define $\chi_4(n)$ to be $0$ if $n$ is even, $1$ if $n \equiv 1 \bmod 4$ and $-1$ is $n \equiv -1 \bmod 4$. Define $\chi_3(n)$ to be $1$, $-1$ or $0$ according to whether $n \equiv 1$, $2$ or $0 \bmod 3$. Then we have
$$L(1, \chi_{\infty}) = \prod_p \left( 1- \chi_4(p) p^{-1} \right)^{-1}  \prod_p \left( 1-\chi_3(p) p^{-1} \right)^{-1} = \left( \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\chi_4(n)}{n} \right)  \left( \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\chi_3(n)}{n} \right) .$$
The sum $\sum \chi_4(n) = 1-1/3+1/5-1/7 + \cdots$ is well known to be $\pi/4$. The sum $\sum \chi_3(n)/n$ is only slightly less well known; it is $\pi/(3 \sqrt{3})$. </p>

<p>So I get $L(1,\chi_{\infty}) = \frac{\pi}{4} \frac{\pi}{3 \sqrt{3}} = \frac{\pi^2}{12 \sqrt{3}}$ and $V = - \frac{\pi^2}{6 \sqrt{3}}$. </p>

<p>Putting it all together,
$$T = \frac{1}{2} \left( - \frac{\log 2 \log(2+\sqrt{3})}{\sqrt{3}}  - \frac{\pi^2}{6 \sqrt{3}} \right) = - \frac{\log 2 \log(2+\sqrt{3})}{2 \sqrt{3}} -  \frac{\pi^2}{12 \sqrt{3}} $$
$$S = \frac{\pi^2}{12}  - \frac{\log 2 \log(2+\sqrt{3})}{2 \sqrt{3}} -  \frac{\pi^2}{12 \sqrt{3}} .$$
The original integral is
$$\frac{1}{2} \left( \log(2)^2 -2 \sqrt{3} S \right) = \frac{\log(2)^2}{2} - \frac{\pi^2 \sqrt{3}}{12} +  \frac{\log 2 \log(2+\sqrt{3})}{2} + \frac{\pi^2}{12}$$
$$=\frac{\pi^2(1-\sqrt{3})}{12} + \log(2) \frac{\log(4 + 2 \sqrt{3})}{2} = \frac{\pi^2(1-\sqrt{3})}{12} + \log(2) \log(1+\sqrt{3})$$
as desired.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Prove that the transpose of a permutation matrix $P$ is its inverse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A permutation matrix $P$ has a single 1 in each row and a single 1 in each column, all other entries being 0.  So column $j$ has a single 1 at position $e_{i_jj}$.  $P$ acts by moving row $j$ to row $i_j$ for each column $j$.  Taking the transpose of $P$ moves each 1 entry from $e_{i_jj}$ to $e_{ji_j}$.  Then $P^t$ acts by moving row $i_j$ to row $j$ for each row $i_j$.  Since this is the inverse operation, $P^t=P^{-1}$.</p>

<p>Again, I welcome any critique of my reasoning and/or my style as well as alternative solutions to the problem.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
","<p>A direct computation is also fine:
$$(PP^T)_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^n P_{ik} P^T_{kj} = \sum_{k=1}^n P_{ik} P_{jk}$$
but $P_{ik}$ is usually 0, and so $P_{ik} P_{jk}$ is usually 0.  The only time $P_{ik}$ is nonzero is when it is 1, but then there are no other $i&#39; \neq i$ such that $P_{i&#39;k}$ is nonzero ($i$ is the only row with a 1 in column $k$). In other words,
$$\sum_{k=1}^n P_{ik} P_{jk} = \begin{cases} 1 &amp; \text{if } i = j \\ 0 &amp; \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$
and this is exactly the formula for the entries of the identity matrix, so

"Continuous mapping on a compact metric space is uniformly continuous","25735","","<p>I am struggling with this question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Prove or give a counterexample: If $f : X \to Y$ is a continuous mapping from a compact metric space $X$, then $f$ is uniformly continuous on $X$. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thanks for your help in advance.</p>
","<p>The answer is yes, if $f$ is continuous on a compact space then it is uniformly continuous:</p>

<p>Let $f: X \to Y$ be continuous, let $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ and let $X$ be a compact metric space. Because $f$ is continuous, for every $x$ in $X$ you can find a $\delta_x$ such that $f(B(\delta_x, x)) \subset B({\varepsilon\over 2}, f(x))$. The balls $\{B(\delta_x, x)\}_{x \in X}$ form an open cover of $X$. So do the balls $\{B(\frac{\delta_x}{2}, x)\}_{x \in X}$. Since $X$ is compact you can find a finite subcover $\{B(\frac{\delta_{x_i}}{2}, x_i)\}_{i=1}^n$. (You will see in a second why we are choosing the radii to be half only.)</p>

<p>Now let $\delta_{x_i}' = {\delta_{x_i}\over 2}$.</p>

<p>You want to choose a distance $\delta$ such that for any two $x,y$ they lie in the same $B(\delta_{x_i}', x_i)$ if their distance is less than $\delta$. </p>

<p>How do you do that? </p>

<p>Note that now that you have finitely many $\delta_{x_i}'$ you can take the minimum over all of them: $\min_i \delta_{x_i}'$. Consider two points $x$ and $y$. Surely $x$ lies in one of the $B(\delta_{x_i}', x_i) $ since they cover the whole space and hence $x$ also lies in $B(\delta_{x_i}', x_i)$ for some $i$. </p>

<p>Now we want $y$ to also lie in $B(\delta_{x_i}', x_i)$. And this is where it comes in handy that we chose a subcover with radii divided by two: </p>

<p>If you pick $\delta : = \min_i \delta_{x_i}'$ (i.e. $\delta = \frac{\delta_{x_i}}{2}$ for some $i$) then $y$ will also lie in $B(\delta_{x_i}, x_i)$: </p>

<p>$d(x_i, y) \leq d(x_i, x) + d(x,y) &lt; \frac{\delta_{x_i}}{2}  + \min_k \delta_{x_k} \leq \frac{\delta_{x_i}}{2} + \frac{\delta_{x_i}}{2} = \delta_{x_i}$.</p>

$S=\pi x^2 =-\frac{3}{2}\pi 8$</p>

","<p>We have that the surface area formula is:</p>

"In how many ways can 20 identical balls be distributed into 4 distinct boxes subject?","25611","","<p>I was practicing math exercises on text book and i got stuck in this question ?</p>

<pre><code>In how many ways can 20 identical balls be distributed 
into 4 distinct boxes subject ?

a) With no constraints.
b) Each box gets at least two balls.
c) Box 1 gets exactly one ball and box 2 gets at least one ball.
d) Each box gets an even number of balls.
</code></pre>
","<p>Hint:
a) You have to write 20 numbers $x_1, x_2 \ldots x_4$ that correspond to the numder of balls that will be placed in boxes 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively. Since, they should add up to 20, you want to determine the number of solutions to the equation: $$x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4=20$$ subject to $0\le x_i$ (practially that means no constraints). According to <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/229430/how-many-integer-solutions-to-a-linear-combination-with-restrictions"">here</a>, you can do it in $$\dbinom{20+4-1}{4-1}=\dbinom{23}{3}=1771$$ ways.</p>

<p>b)Now place 2 balls in each box. So there remain 12 balls. Then as above you want to determine the number of solutions to the equation: $$x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4=12$$ subject to $0\le x_i$. Proceeding as in (a), you can do it in $$\dbinom{12+4-1}{4-1}=\dbinom{15}{3}=455$$ ways.</p>

<p>c)Place 1 ball in box 1 and close it. Place 1 ball in box 2. So there remain 18 balls and 3 boxes. Then as above you want to determine the number of solutions to the equation: $$x_2+x_3+x_4=18$$ subject to $0\le x_i$. Proceeding as above, you can do it in $$\dbinom{18+3-1}{3-1}=\dbinom{20}{2}=190$$ ways.</p>

<p>d)Put now the balls in pairs. So you have 10 pairs and you want to place them in the 4 boxes. That is exactly the problem stated in (a). Similarly you can do it in $\dbinom{10+4-1}{4-1}=\dbinom{13}{3}=286$
ways.</p>

"Deleting any digit yields a prime... is there a name for this?","25579","","<p>My son likes his grilled cheese sandwich cut into various numbers, the number depends on his mood.  His mother won't indulge his requests, but I often will.  Here is the day he wanted 100:
<p>
 <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rcnII.jpg"" alt=""100 sandwich"">
<p>
But today he wanted the prime 719, which I obliged.  When deciding which digit to eat first, he went through the choices, trying to make a composite with the digits left behind.  But he quickly realized that eating any digit would leave a prime: 71, 79, 19 are all prime.  Pleased with his discovery of this prime 719, he tried to find a larger one, but couldn't.</p>

<p>My questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do these primes have a name?</li>
<li>Can you think of any more of them (clearly 23 is the smallest)?</li>
<li>Are there an infinite number of them?</li>
<li>Is there likely to be a way to find them short of using a computer?</li>
</ul>
","<p>Here is a heuristic for why we should expect there are only finitely many of these numbers.  Let $P$ be the set of positive integers with your special property.</p>

<p>A large number $n$ is prime with probability approximately
$$ \frac{1}{\log n}. $$
For a number $n$ to be in $P$, it must remain prime with the removal of each digit.  Removing a digit from a number $n$ results in a number on the order of 
$$\frac{n}{10}.$$<br>
A number $n$ has approximately
$$\frac{\log n}{\log 10}$$
digits.
As a result, the probability that $n$ is in $P$ can be approximated as
$$ \left( \frac{1}{\log \frac{n}{10} } \right)^{\frac{\log n}{\log 10}} = \frac{1}{n^{\frac{\log \log (n/10)}{\log 10}}}$$
In general, if the probability of $n$ being in a set $S$ is $p(n)$ then if 
$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} p(n)$$
is finite, we can expect $S$ to be finite; if the sum is infinite, we can expect $S$ to be infinite.  In the case of $P$, since the sum
$$\sum_{n=2}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^{\frac{\log \log (n/10)}{\log 10}}}$$
converges (by comparison with, say, $\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2}$) we may conclude that we should expect $P$ to be finite.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this is just a heuristic, so does not constitute a proof of the finiteness of $P$, nor does it give any idea how large the largest element of $P$ might be.</p>

<p>Addition: I just realized that I wasn't assuming $n$ needed to be prime to be in $P$, only that it was prime after the removal of any one digit.  So, my $P$ would include 27.  Requiring only prime numbers in $P$ just makes the set smaller, so the above argument applies just as well is we require $P$ to only contain prime numbers.</p>

","<p>Your answer for part <strong>(a)</strong> is fine. For part <strong>(b)</strong>, we have to ask what does ""at most four"" mean?

<p><strong>(C)</strong> is similar to (b), but ""at least four"" means four or more. Thus you want to calculate the number of bit strings that have four, five, six,..., up to <code>10</code> ones, then add these together (or is there an easier way to do it if we realize that at most three is the opposite of at least four?)</p>

<p>Then for <strong>(D)</strong>, if we have the same number of zeros and ones, how many ones do we have? If we calculate the number of bit strings that have that many ones, we are done.</p>

","<p>This is an old favorite of mine.<br>
Define $$I=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} e^{-x^2} dx$$ 
Then $$I^2=\bigg(\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} e^{-x^2} dx\bigg)\bigg(\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} e^{-y^2} dy\bigg)$$  
$$I^2=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}e^{-(x^2+y^2)} dxdy$$  
Now change to polar coordinates<br>
$$I^2=\int_{0}^{+2 \pi}\int_{0}^{+\infty}e^{-r^2} rdrd\theta$$  
The $\theta$ integral just gives $2\pi$, while the $r$ integral succumbs to the substitution $u=r^2$  
$$I^2=2\pi\int_{0}^{+\infty}e^{-u}du/2=\pi$$ 
So $$I=\sqrt{\pi}$$ and your integral is half this by symmetry</p>
