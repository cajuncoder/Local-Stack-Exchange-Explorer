"How to get from Nice to Monaco by public transport?","287735","","<p>What's the <strong>simplest and cheapest way</strong> to get from central Nice, France to Monaco by public transportation?</p>
","<p><strong>Bus 100</strong> (Nice - Monaco - Menton) is a very good option and costs a mere  <strong>1.50 €</strong> (<a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/11066/how-to-get-from-nice-to-monaco-by-public-transport#comment93779_11067"">2015</a>). It runs every 15 minutes mostly, and the trip takes 30-45 minutes. It takes an absolutely scenic route along the coast, passing through seaside towns such as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villefranche-sur-Mer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Villefranche</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaulieu-sur-Mer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Beaulieu</a>. </p>

<p>(There's also express bus 100X which takes the motorway and costs 4 € (2012); obviously not as good for sightseeing.)</p>

<p>In Nice, the 100 now leaves from <a href=""http://www.lignesdazur.com/ri/cartegoogle.asp?pa_id2=1475"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>Le Port</strong></a>; follow link for exact locations on map. (The departure stop has changed a couple of times in recent years, having previously been <a href=""http://www.lignesdazur.com/ri/cartegoogle.asp?pa_id2=1216"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ségurane</a>, next to Place Garibaldi, and <a href=""https://www.google.fi/maps/@43.701181,7.278969,3a,75y,242.2h,77.31t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1s3AaUNNLHmobu5dThNLxuJw!2e0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Promenades des Arts</a>.)</p>

<p>Arriving in Monaco, there are 6 stops to choose from (do get off at one of these as the bus continues towards Menton):<br>
Cimetière, <a href=""http://goo.gl/maps/3lTa6"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Place d'Armes</a>, Stade Nautique, Office de Tourisme, Place des Moulins, Les Carabiniers. </p>

<p>Heading from Monaco towards Nice, the route is slightly different; then the Monaco stops are:<br>
Les Carabiniers, Place des Moulins, Casino (Allée Lumière), Sainte Dévote, <a href=""http://goo.gl/maps/sbZ3F"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Place d'Armes</a>, Cimetière.</p>

<p><strong>The buses don't run very late</strong>: last one from Nice leaves at 20:00, and from Monaco at 20:22. First departures in the morning are about 6:00. You'll find details and full list of stops in <strong><a href=""http://www.lignesdazur.com/ftp/lignes_FR/FH%20L100%2001092013.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bus 100 timetable</a></strong>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Alternatively, take the <strong>train</strong> (""Nice Ville"" to ""Monaco Monte Carlo""). It is faster (22 mins) and arguably easier, but costs a little more at <strong>3.90 €</strong>. There are about 2 regional trains per hour (daytime), <a href=""http://www.sncf.com/en/passengers"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">according to SNCF</a>. A good thing is that <strong>the trains run much later</strong>; last one leaves from Nice 22:25 and from Monaco 23:12 (on weekdays). </p>

<p>The above applies to regional trains (TER) which would probably be your primary choice on this route, though you <em>could</em> also catch an intercity/TGV. </p>

Those have been used as well by numerous other airlines, for example <a href=""http://www.cathaypacific.com/cx/en_TH/travel-information/baggage/restricted-items/batteries.html"">Cathay Pacific</a>. They generally impose a limit on capacity per passenger and on top of this disallow checking them in, so you must take them into your hand luggage.</p>

<p>Is it <em>safe</em> to do so?</p>

<p>My concern is that pressurized containers may not be allowed due to the potential pressure decrease on the plane.</p>

<p>Answers applicable only to US domestic flights are also welcome.</p>
","<p><a href=""http://safetravel.dot.gov/aerosol_tips.html"">SafeTravel</a> covers this somewhat, saying you'll want to check the details on your deodorant / other can.  If it says it's a flammable product, it may not be permitted in your checked luggage. </p>

<p>If it's not flammable, however, then it should be fine to travel with, provided the top is on.</p>

<p>So to be clear - it's the flammability that's more of a concern here, rather than any explosions from pressure - most large passenger plane cargo holds are pressurized.  In fact in larger jets, pressurization of the cargo hold is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabin_pressurization"">also required to prevent damage to pressure-sensitive goods</a> that might leak, expand, burst or be crushed on re-pressurization.</p>

"Do I need a US visa to transit (or layover) through an American airport?","257866","","<p>In Europe usually you don't need to go through immigration to change planes (unless you are entering/exiting Schengen). Is it the case in the US as well? May I catch a connecting flight on one of the US airports if I don't have US visa?</p>
","<p>Unlike many other countries, US airports do not have any form of physical immigration controls when you are departing the country on an international flight. In fact, in most airports there isn't even a concept of an ""International"" terminal/gate, with the same gates frequently being used for international flights and domestic flights.</p>

<p>As a result of this they can't enforce the concept of a 'transit' passenger - once you're in the departure area, even if you got there on the pretext of catching another international flight out of the country a few hours later, there's nothing to stop you boarding a different domestic flight, or even simply walking out of the airport!</p>

<p>This means that ALL passengers arriving on international flights in the US must have the legal right to enter the US; i.e, you must either be a US citizen/green card holder, be from a country that does not have any visa requirements (such as Canada or Bermuda), be from a country that is a part of the US Visa Waiver Program and have a valid <a href=""https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ESTA</a>, or have a US Visa.</p>

However, I realised that this is not possible. So what can I do now? I have already checked in, but no boarding pass. Is there any way to print that again at the airport? Or is it enough if I have my confirmation number? Or the boarding pass as a PDF?</p>
","<p>Many of the major airlines do have self-service checkin machines at the airport. I know <a href=""http://www.klm.com/travel/nl_en/prepare_for_travel/checkin_options/airport_checkin/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">KLM</a>, allows printing forgotten or failed prints. </p>

<p>If your airlines does not have these self service machines, and you are not yet at the airport, try going to a print or copyshop. Most airports these days have these shops, but sometimes they can have quite some waiting queues, which will be adding stress to your journey.</p>

<p>Depending on the airline you are traveling, you could choose to use a <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/2907/can-you-use-a-kindle-as-a-boarding-pass"">mobile device</a> as an alternative boarding card. This only works if your boarding pass has a bar code they use to scan prior to boarding. What you need to do is make a pdf of your boarding pass and store it on your device. I always do this these days and this already  saved me once.</p>

<p>A final option is to just approach the check in desk and ask a reprint. This is the least favorable solution, since the whole idea behind online check in is to minimize contact time at a manned checkin desk. Some airlines are then reluctant to help you in these request, some airlines (Ryanair comes to mind) have a hefty fee if you ask for a reprint. In the case of Ryanair this is 40 euros or even higher. </p>

","<p>Why yes there is.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.gov.uk/transit-visa/overview"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This UK government site will tell you if you need a visa to transit through the UK</a>. You enter your nationality, destination, and any visas you already hold, and it will tell you if you need a transit visa or not. It also includes instructions for applying for one.</p>

<p>As a summary (but check for exceptions):</p>

<ul>
<li>You must arrive and depart by air, and your outbound flight must be booked and confirmed. </li>
<li>You don't need a transit visa if you would not need a visa for a tourist visit to the UK.</li>
<li>A transit visa comes in two forms: Direct Airside Transit Visa (DATV) which is limited to 24 hours and you must remain 'airside' (i.e. cannot pass through immigration) and a Visitor in Transit Visa, which is valid for 48 hours and allows you to change airports (and terminals at airports where you can't do that airside).</li>
<li>You must have all the necessary documentation for your final destination, including any visas.</li>
<li>You are exempt from needing a transit visa under certain conditions.  These can be found at <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/check-uk-visa"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.gov.uk/check-uk-visa</a>.  As of 25 June 2015, the conditions are:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>You might be eligible for ‘transit without visa’ if:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>you arrive and depart by air, and</li>
  <li>[you] have a confirmed onward flight that leaves on the day you arrive or before midnight on the day after you arrive, and</li>
  <li>[you] have the right documents for your destination (eg a visa for that country)</li>
  </ul>

  <li>you’re travelling to (or on part of a reasonable journey to) Australia, Canada, New Zealand or the USA and have a valid visa for that country</li>
  <li>you’re travelling from (or on part of a reasonable journey from) Australia, Canada, New Zealand or the USA and have a valid visa for that country</li>
  <li>you’re travelling from (or on part of a reasonable journey from) Australia, Canada, New Zealand or the USA and it’s less than 6 months since you last entered that country with a valid entry visa</li>
  <li>you have a residence permit issued by Australia or New Zealand</li>
  <li>you have a common format residence permit issued by an European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland</li>
  <li>you have a residence permit issued by Canada issued after 28 June 2002</li>
  <li>you have a uniform format category D visa for entry to a country in the EEA or Switzerland</li>
  <li>you have an Irish biometric visa and an onward flight ticket to the Republic of Ireland</li>
  <li>you’re travelling from the Republic of Ireland and it’s less than 3 months since you were last given permission, on the basis of holding a valid Irish biometric visa, to land or be in Ireland</li>
  <li>you have a valid USA permanent residence card issued by the USA on or after 21 April 1998</li>
  <li>you have a valid USA I-551 Temporary Immigrant visa issued by the USA (a wet-ink stamp version will not be accepted)</li>
  <li>you have an expired USA I-551 Permanent Residence card issued by the USA on or after 21 April 1998, with a valid I-797 letter authorising extension</li>
  <li>you have a valid standalone US Immigration Form 155A/155B issued by the USA (attached to a sealed brown envelope)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>You won’t be able to transit without a visa if a Border Force officer decides you don’t qualify under the immigration rules. You can <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/transit-visa"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">apply for a transit visa</a> before you travel if you’re unsure whether you qualify for transiting without a visa.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Beware</strong> that the exemption conditions for visa-less landside transit are slightly different from the exceptions for Direct Airside Transit.</p>

<p>In London Heathrow, London Gatwick and Manchester, if you fly from outside the UK or Ireland and leave to another country (neither UK nor Ireland), it is possible to transit without entering the UK and going through UK Border Control, you can stay airside. There is no hotel airside, and the transit areas close overnight, so <a href=""http://www.heathrowairport.com/heathrow-airport-guide/arriving-passengers/immigration-and-passports"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">if you have an overnight stopover</a>, you have to go through UK Border Control.

","<p>Yes - it does increase the risk of identity theft, however for most successful identity thefts, the attacker would need various other bits of information as well.</p>

<p>The best way to think of it is that every piece of information about you an attacker has, the less effort he has to expend to impersonate you.</p>

<p>Once an attacker can impersonate you they could steal your money (this happens a lot with online banking), your house (a handful of cases seen so far), your credit rating, your reputation, and generally cause you major problems.</p>

I thought it'd be a handy question to have on here, for those sorting out visas and the like when wondering about consulates and embassies.</p>

<p>So, the question - from a traveller's point of view, what's the difference between an embassy and a consulate, and what would you use each one for?</p>
","<p>From the perspective of a traveler, there is almost zero difference.</p>

<p>Both embassies and consulates are representative departments of a foreign country/government within another country.</p>

<p>Technically, an Embassy is where an ""Ambassador"" is based.  As there can only be one Ambassador for a specific country, there can only be (at most) one Embassy.  As the Ambassador is the highest ranking representative of that foreign government, the Embassy is thus also deemed to be the highest level of representative location.</p>

<p>A consulate is similar, but generally deemed to be a lower ranking due to the lack of an Ambassador. Consulates will generally be smaller - often being more like an office where the embassy often doubles as the actual residence for the Ambassador and/or some of his staff.</p>

<p>Some countries may not have an embassy in a specific country, but may only have a consulate there. This will occur in the situation where there is no ambassador assigned to the country.</p>

<p>From a travel perspective, both will generally provide the same services, and normally location will be far more relevant than the name.  In some cases consulates may be slower to process requests as they may simply pass them onto the Embassy rather than doing them themselves. eg, the Australia consulate in San Francisco does not issue new passports - they are forwarded to the embassy in Washington DC, however all passport requests from people in the San Francisco area must be done via the local consulate and can not be sent directly to the embassy!</p>

<p>I have had this problem many times. If you end up with old USD bills older that series 2003-6 then it won't be accepted by most countries and money changers outside the United States. More frequently the problem I have noticed is with the bills with the front face photo to be smaller than the current bills. <strong>Bills with the enlarged pictures i.e the new ones are widely accepted.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>This does not apply to the smaller denomination such as 1, 5, 10 as these denominations still use the smaller pictures.</em></p>

<p>I would suggest two solutions. The first is to try a large bank within the city you are traveling to. These have sophisticated machines and UV scanners which would allow them to check your money without concern and exchange it. Unfortunately this method is not <em>fool proof</em> and you may get rejected in one or two places before you come forth one which will accept it.</p>

<p>They are still legal tender and will be valid in the United States. They are not used outside due to lack of security within these old bills. So obviously the other solution is to either spend them in the United States or deposit them in an ATM in the United States where they are easily accepted. You can then withdraw from the ATM smaller bills which will be fresh and would most likely not have this issue.</p>

","<p>The nomenclature is confusing but here's the difference:</p>

<ol>
<li>iTicket - Fancy name for a paper ticket bought through their website. You specify the journey details, passenger information, and pay online. The ticket is sent through courier to the delivery address specified. This is the same as the ticket you get when you buy from a railway booking counter.<br>
Downside:

<li>You cannot cancel this ticket online. You have to queue up at a railway booking counter and produce the ticket and the booking clerk cancels it for you.</li>
<li>You have to buy an iTicket  at least 3 days before the journey date. This time is required because the ticket is physically delivered to the customer's address.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>eTicket - Stands for 'electronic ticket'. It's a paperless, online-only ticket.  No need to take a printout of the page before travelling. Just show id proof to TTR

"What kind of ID does the US accept when visiting bars or drinking age events?","131217","","<p>For tourists visiting the states, what kind of ID do you need to carry with you to visit bars or drinking age events?  I understand the passport is the main piece of ID but do they accept any other forms of ID from other countries such as a driver's license with a photo?</p>
","<p>There is no nationally, or even locally mandated standard. I've certainly seen friends have no issues using both Passports and Drivers Licenses from their home country. I've also seen people have issues - especially when their ID is written in a non-latin script, or when they have a DOB which can be misread by using a non-American date ordering scheme, (i.e. someone born on August the 10th, 1992, would have their BOD listed as 8/10/92 here in the states, and would be of legal drinking age. If their ID instead reads 10/8/92 a not particularly sharp waiter may give you a hard time - admittedly, an extreme edge case.)</p>

<p>Realistically, there's no single answer that can be provided here however, because there is no standard for what's accepted. At the end of the day, the acceptability of your proof of age is up to the merchant with whom you do business to evaluate. You'll have an easier time in more cosmopolitan cities like New York, but realistically, you can't do much better than your Passport, and I've almost never seen an issue with one.</p>

"Is there a legal limit to the amount of cash one can carry on domestic US flights?","124849","","<p>Is there a legal limit to the amount of physical cash a US citizen can possess when flying from one US state to another?

However, I have not been able to get a definitive answer as to if these reported seizures are due to other illegal activity or if carrying cash over a certain dollar amount is in itself illegal.</p>

<p>Before anyone marks this as a duplicate, I am not talking about customs reporting, foreign currency limits or bringing money into or out of the United States. I'm only asking specifically about carrying good o'll US dollars from one state in the United States to another (NY to TX) on a domestic flight.</p>
","<p>No, <a href=""http://www.airsafe.com/issues/baggage/cash.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">there's not a legal limit</a>. However, <a href=""http://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/currency-coins-precious-metals-or-valuable-jewelry"" rel=""nofollow"">TSA does recommend that you ask to be screened in private</a> if you're carrying a lot of currency or other valuables in order to prevent drawing attention to items that could be stolen. This is probably good advice since you are separated from your luggage for a bit at the checkpoint, especially if you get stuck waiting in a slower-than-normal line for the scanner after placing your baggage on the conveyor.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I've heard that the United States government can and is seizing any amount of cash over a certain dollar amount at airports.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is definitely not true. They may be curious why you're carrying $30k in cash and may ask you about it, but they will not (and, legally, can not) seize it unless they have probable cause to believe that you have committed or are about to commit a crime and that said cash is reasonably likely to be evidence of said crime. If they do have probable cause to suspect a crime, then they can refer the matter to law enforcement and keep you around until law enforcement gets there to question you. From the TSA Management Directive copied into page 19 of <a href=""http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/TSA.Switzer_Decl_attachments_1_2_and_3_0.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">this legal proceedings document</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When currency appears to be indicative of criminal activity, TSA may report the matter to the appropriate authorities. For all flights, factors indicating that cash is related to criminal activity include the quantity, packaging, circumstances of discovery, or method by which the cash is carried, including concealment... TSA may also note any factors related to criminal activity for purposes of notifying CBP [for international passengers] and/or law enforcement, as well as request that the individual remain accessible pursuant to such notification.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course the best advice is probably to simply not carry large amounts of currency with you when you fly in the first place. If you carry it on, it could be stolen at the checkpoint either by a TSA agent or by another passenger. TSA doesn't keep track of whose bag is whose when they go through the conveyor. If someone grabs your bag or takes something out of it before you clear the scanner, they aren't going to know that the bag doesn't belong to that person until it's too late. For checked luggage, you are separated from it from the time you check in until you get to the baggage carousel at your destination. Airline agents, TSA agents, baggage handlers, ground crew, etc. at each airport you transit have access to your bags when you can't see them, so it would be nearly impossible for you to catch the culprit if someone decided to help themselves to some cash. If you do have to fly with large amounts of cash, <a href=""http://www.airsafe.com/issues/baggage/cash.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">this page</a> has useful advice.</p>

","<p>The obvious answer is to pay for your tickets!  Presuming you have solid travel plans (which is what they are trying to ask you to prove by showing tickets!) then this shouldn't be a problem.</p>

<p>Of course, the one catch with this is that if your visa application is rejected, you've now got tickets that you are unable to use.  Some airlines will allow you to get a refund under circumstances like this (even for a non-refundable ticket), as will some travel insurance policies - however many will not.</p>

<p>There's a few other alternatives, each with their own advantages and disadvantages :</p>

<ul>
<li>Ask your travel agent to provide an itinerary, including flight details (and confirmation numbers if they have them - these are generated before the ticket is paid for) and use that as proof of your flights.</li>
<li>Buy a full-fare, refundable ticket and use that for the visa application process.  Once the visa is approved, cancel the ticket (getting a full refund), and then book a discount ticket.  The biggest catch is that you'll be out of pocket for a reasonable amount of money for a while, and in the interim the ticket prices for the cheap flights might have gone up.</li>
<li>Bite the bullet and just buy the tickets - on the presumption that the visa will be approved.</li>

","<p>As a Londoner who does that route a lot:</p>

<ul>

"How big is ""too big"" for an airline seat? At what point will you be required to buy two tickets?","120095","","<p>As I said in another question, I'm bringing my parents to visit me here in Sweden next year.</p>

<p>My mother is around 280-300 pounds and 5'6"" (130-135kg, 1.67m). I am concerned that she might be asked at the airport to buy a second seat. If it's likely I would rather just buy the second seat in advance, because I don't want her to be embarassed/humiliated by some random employee. As well, I won't be there, they will be travelling alone and aren't used to dealing with airports and they won't know what their rights are.</p>

<p>In terms of how it will affect other passengers, it's not important, she will get a window seat and my dad will sit in the middle seat, so I don't see it affecting anybody. </p>

<p>She insists it's fine, ""the last time I flew I fit easily!"" but that was 20 years ago when she was half the size. </p>

<p>They will be flying BA or SAS, definitely not Ryanair.</p>

<p>So - where is the cutoff? Is a 300 pound 5'6"" woman going to be too big to fit in a single airline seat? Or am I worrying about nothing?</p>
","<p>The reason why airlines implement a policy of asking overweight people to get two seats is an air safety issue of whether they can be strapped in properly. The guideline used for this is <strong>whether a passenger can fit between the armrests</strong>. If a passenger requires two seats, then the policy differs from airline-to-airline if/what the passenger should be charged for it.</p>

<p>On London to Sweden flights, British Airways flies Airbus A319/A320-100/200 aircraft with <a href=""http://www.seatguru.com/airlines/British_Airways/information.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a seat width of 17"" (43 cm) in Economy <strike>and 18.5"" (47 cm) in Premium Economy</a> (""World Traveller Plus"").

<p><a href=""http://www.seatguru.com/airlines/Ryanair/information.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ryanair has the same 17"" (43 cm) seat width</a> as BA, and <a href=""http://www.seatguru.com/airlines/easyJet_Airlines/information.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">easyJet has 18"" (46 cm) seat width</a> - the difference is that seat pitch (distance) is a good 4-5"" (10–13 cm) less than 'full-cost' airlines.

"Why are airline passengers asked to lift up window shades during takeoff and landing?","119729","","<p>I have always wondered why the windows shades have to be raised during take off and landing. I can't think of any safety issues by having a closed window.</p>
","<p>I will answer this with a very long answer, since aviation safety is my day to day job.</p>

<p>The window shade opening is a part of a long process to prepare the cabin for sudden (unexpected) emergencies. Why is that? Well, cabin crew have only <strong>90 seconds</strong> to evacuate all passengers in case of emergencies. The process of evacuation itself should not take more than 90 seconds regardless of the size of the aircraft or the number of passengers. So to make the evacuation possible in 90 seconds cabin crew and other airlines staff will prepare every flight in advance to make this possible. One example is the emergency exits, only healthy adults are allowed to occupy these seats, they are also required to read the safety card for emergency exits to make them prepared in case of emergencies to help the cabin crew. They are called ABPs (Able-Bodied-Persons). This is just one example.</p>

<p>Anyway window shades opening is a small part of a long preparation process. Passengers are asked to open window shades before take offs and landings because these are considered to be <strong>critical times</strong> in aviation. Many things can go wrong during these times (most accidents do happen during take offs or landings), so people are asked to open window shades along with other things (seats in upright position, people seated and buckled etc.) to make everything prepared as if the plane were in emergency. In case something goes wrong (God forbid) things will be ready in advance so cabin crew can easily evacuate people in the short period of 90 seconds. </p>

<p>Specific reasons behind the window shade opening include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Passengers are curious, hence they are perfect <em>extra eyes</em> to see if something goes wrong out there. Usually passengers report stuff right away.</li>
<li>In case of sudden emergencies, every second counts. Therefore if shades are open crew can easily see outside conditions to help them in planning the evacuation (which doors to use for evacuation etc.).</li>
<li>In case of emergency (which is more likely during take offs and landings) people should be prepared just in case. So during daytime, opening window shades and putting cabin lights to full makes the eyes used to sunlight so if something goes wrong and passengers need to be evacuated there will not be sudden change in light contrast which might lead to temporary blurred vision. Same thing at night flights, window shades are open and cabin lights are dimmed. </li>
<li>It helps ground emergency personnel outside to see the inside of the cabin. </li>
</ul>

<p>These rules might be different from one airline to another, but in general almost all airlines require their crews to make sure of the window shades during take offs and landings. They also add it in the preparation announcements prior to take offs and landings.</p>

","<p>It would depend on the airline and the airport/country but no matter how you buy the ticket, the next big step is what's called “checking in”. This is when the airline assigns you a seat and confirms that you will indeed be flying.</p>

<p>In most cases, you can now check in online a few days to a few hours before departure and print the boarding pass at home (or wherever you can find a printer). You can then show up at the airport and present this self-printed boarding pass together with your passport to drop your luggage off and go through the security and police check (where applicable).

","<p>Officially the only reason you'll need your old passport is if it contains any visas that are still current - despite being in the old passport these visas are generally still valid.  If this is the case, then obviously you'll just want to carry your passport with you.</p>

<p>If you have no visas, then the best advise I can give you is to put your old passport in one of your bags (preferably one of the bags you check-in). In the event that you lose your current passport - especially if in a foreign country - having your old passport will make the process of obtaining a replacement much easier.</p>

<p>Personally I have my previous passport in an envelope containing some spare cash, a spare ATM card, and an old Drivers License.  To date I've never needed any of these, but it's good to know they are there if I ever need them!</p>

"Can you search for a job when using a tourist visa (B-2) in the US","112453","","<p>If I am visiting the US with a tourist visa, can I look for a job in the US?</p>
","<p>Contrary to the allegations of some other answers here, <a href=""http://www.cbp.gov/"">CBP (U.S. Customs and Border Protection)</a> does not make up rules on the spot.  Here is, quite literally, the letter of the law on who's allowed into the US and who's not:</p>

In other words, if you give CBP reason to suspect that you're coming to the United States to work <em>on this visit</em> (say, a plumber rocking up with a box full of tools), you will be denied entry.  But you are perfectly within your rights as a tourist or business visitor to enquire about <em>future</em> employment, go to interviews, etc, as long as a) you're not paid money for it, and b) you leave the United States and get a proper work visa before you come back.</p>

","<p>When you are departing from the UK and travelling to a non-EU country, you have to declare if you have €10000 or equivalent at UK customs (around $13000).

"I have two passports/nationalities. How do I use them when I travel?","107419","","<p>I am a citizen of two different countries, and have two passports.  How should I use my passports when traveling?</p>
","<p>This is a common situation, and it's generally no problem.  I'll use <strong>A</strong> for the country you're in, and <strong>B</strong> for the country you're going to, but all the ""flows"" described here work equally well if you want to use your B passport to go to a third country.</p>

<h2>Case 1: Same name, dual citizenship OK</h2>

<p>If you have <strong>the same name in both passports</strong> (that is, same first name and last name, minor variations are OK), and <strong>both countries accept dual citizenship</strong> (if you're not sure, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_citizenship"" rel=""noreferrer"">find out here</a>), the basic formula is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Show the airline the passport of the country you're going to</li>
<li>Show immigration the passport for the country you're in</li>
</ul>

<p>In step-by-step detail, when flying from A to B and back:</p>

<ol>
<li>At check-in, show your B passport.  This way the airline knows you will be allowed to enter your destination.</li>
<li>At exit immigration, show your A passport. (In countries without exit immigration, like the US, you may need to show A as well at check-in.)</li>
<li>At the gate, show either passport, doesn't matter.</li>
<li>Fly.</li>
<li>On arrival immigration, show your B passport.</li>
</ol>

<p>And on the way back from B to A, just reverse the process:</p>

<ol>
<li>At check-in, show your A passport.  This way the airline knows you will be allowed to enter your destination.</li>
<li>At exit immigration, show your B passport.</li>
<li>At the gate, show either passport, doesn't matter.</li>
<li>Fly.</li>
<li>On arrival immigration, show your A passport.</li>

<h2>Case 2: Different names, dual citizenship OK</h2>

<p><strong>If your names are different</strong>, but your countries are OK with each other:</p>

<ol>
<li>Book your flight with the name on your A passport.</li>
<li>At airline check-in, show your A passport that matches the name on your ticket, and your B passport, that proves you're allowed to enter.</li>
<li>At exit immigration, show your A passport.</li>
<li>At the gate, show your A passport, so that your name matches your ticket.</li>
<li>Fly.</li>
<li>On arrival immigration, show your B passport.</li>
<li>On the way back, at check-in, show your A passport only.</li>
<li>At exit immigration, show your B passport.</li>
<li>At the gate, show your A passport, so that your name matches your ticket.</li>
<li>Fly back.

<ol start=""10"">
<li>On arrival immigration, show your A passport.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<h2>Case 3: Same name, dual citizenship not OK</h2>

<p>Things get harder if <strong>one or both your countries does not accept dual citizenship</strong>, especially if they care enough to look for visas or arrival stamps.  The key thing to understand here is that <em>the airline is not a part of immigration</em>.  They do not care if you have multiple passports and they are not going to tell immigration if you do, all they want to know if whether you will be allowed in at your destination.</p>

<p>So here's one way to avoid letting A know you are also a citizen of B (but B will know you've come from A):</p>

<ol>
<li>Book a flight from A to B via a <strong>neutral third country C</strong>, where you do not need a visa.  (For example, Malaysia does not accept dual citizenship, so dual-citizen Malaysians often travel via Singapore.)</li>
<li>On check-in, show your A passport.</li>
<li>At exit immigration, show your A passport.</li>
<li>Fly to C.</li>
<li>Connect to your flight to B.</li>
<li>At arrival immigration, show your B passport.</li>
</ol>

<p>On the way back, though, you will need a short detour:</p>

<ol>
<li>At check in, show your B passport.</li>
<li>At exit immigration, show your B passport.</li>
<li>Fly to C.</li>
<li>On arrival at C, do <em>not</em> go to transfer, but instead go to immigration, show your A passport and get it stamped.  (Leave enough time for this!)</li>
<li>If you need to check-in again, show your A passport.</li>
<li>At C's exit immigration, show your A passport again and get it stamped again.</li>
<li>Fly to A.</li>
<li>At arrival immigration, show your A passport.  This will have a departure stamp from C, neatly hiding that you were actually in B.</li>
</ol>

<p>Beware that this is not <em>totally</em> foolproof, as a very careful inspection of your stamps will reveal that you were not in C for the whole time, but unless you're North Korean, it's unlikely you will be subjected to this level of scrutiny.  Some people choose to go through immigration in C on the way out as well, so they get more decoy stamps. Doing that is necessary if you also want country B not to know that you've come from A (making the scenario symmetric).</p>

<h2>Case 4: Different names, dual citizenship not OK</h2>

<p>If you have different names <em>and</em> your countries don't like each other, you can still use the same method as above, but you'll likely need to book your A-C-A flight in your ""A"" name and your C-B-C flight in your ""B"" name.</p>

Wikipedia <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_policy_in_the_European_Union#Airport_transit"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">has a good summary as well</a>. Some embassies or government websites from the various Schengen countries also provide useful summaries. Legally, the main source for all this is the <a href=""http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/free_movement_of_persons_asylum_immigration/jl0028_en.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Schengen visa code</a>. </p>

<p>Here is a step-by-step guide through the rules to decide if you need a visa:</p>

<h2>1. Can you enter the Schengen area?</h2>

<p>If you can enter the Schengen area, you can also transit there. You can enter the Schengen area if you are an EU/EFTA citizen, hold a Schengen visa, a long-stay visa or residence permit from one of the Schengen countries or come from a country whose citizens don't need a visa to visit the Schengen area. <strong>If any of these apply, you can stop here, you don't need a visa. If none of these apply, read further.</strong></p>

<p>The list of countries whose citizens don't need a visa to enter the Schengen area can be found on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_policy_in_the_European_Union#Visa_exemptions"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>. They are also colored green on <a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/borders-and-visas/visa-policy/map_en.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this map from the EU Commission</a>.</p>

<h2>2. Can you transfer without leaving the international area of the airport?</h2>

<p>Many airports in Europe have an international area with transfer/check-in counters, waiting area, sometimes lounges, restaurants, shops <a href=""http://www.amsterdam.info/airport-museum/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">or even a museum</a> <em>before</em> the border checkpoint where the police check the passports of passengers entering the Schengen area. Gates for non-Schengen destinations can be accessed from this area, whereas domestic and Schengen-bound flights depart from other parts of the airport.</p>

<p>Whether you can transit without leaving this area will depend on your specific connection (airport/terminal, airline, time). For example, <a href=""http://www.germany.info/contentblob/4874040/Daten/7545420/Airport_Transit_Country_List.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">some German airports close at night</a>, so that it's not possible to remain in the international area for an overnight transfer. Luggage belts are typically <em>after</em> the passport check so if your luggage cannot be checked through to a destination outside of the Schengen area, you will also have a problem.</p>

<p>Finally, as passengers' passports don't have to be checked on flights <em>within</em> the Schengen area, if you have two stopovers in the Schengen area (for example Mumbai-Vienna-Frankfurt-Chicago or Nairobi-Zurich-Frankfurt-Chișinău), you <em>will</em> have to leave the international area and go through the border checkpoint to catch your intra-Schengen flight. Same thing if you need to change airports.</p>

<p><strong>If you have to leave the international area to make your transfer, you cannot transit without a visa</strong> and you need a full Schengen visa (and <em>not</em> merely an “airport transit visa”). <strong>If you can stay in the international area (“transit airside”), read further.</strong></p>

<h2>3. Do citizens of your country require a visa to transit airside?</h2>

<p>If you have come so far, it means you come from a country whose citizens require a visa to <em>enter</em> the Schengen area. But there is still a distinction between two categories of countries among them. While most people can transit airside without a visa, citizens of a smaller list of countries need an “airport transit visa” even if they don't want to go through the border checkpoint and enter the Schengen area.</p>

<p>Where things get complicated is that the list of countries whose citizens need an airport transit visa is slightly different from one Schengen country to the other. There is a list for the whole Schengen area (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_policy_in_the_European_Union#Airport_transit"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">list in Wikipedia</a>, dark red/burgundy on the <a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/borders-and-visas/visa-policy/map_en.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">map from the EU</a>) but individual Schengen member states can also add countries to the list. They have to inform the Commission, which keeps a list of all these requirements (<a href=""https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/annex_7b_atv-national_lists_en.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">current list as PDF</a>, see also the same Wikipedia article).</p>

<p><strong>If your country is not on either of these lists, stop here, you don't need a visa.</strong> On the other hand, if your country is on one of the lists (the general Europe-wide list or the one from the country where you are going to transit), you might need an “airport transit visa” but read further as there are some exceptions.</p>

<h2>4. Are there other rules that could allow you to transit without a visa?</h2>

<p>If your transfer requires an airport transit visa, there might still be a way to transit without a visa as the Schengen Visa code provides for a number of exceptions for people who hold some other visas or residence permits. Note that those exceptions only apply to the <em>airport transit visa</em> requirement. If you need to enter the Schengen area (see question 2), these exceptions do not apply.</p>

<p>Specifically, you are exempted from the airport transit visa requirement if you hold a valid visa from an EU country (that's the whole EU, not only the Schengen area so also Ireland, the UK, Cyprus, Bulgaria, Romania, and Croatia), Canada, Japan or the <a href=""http://www.consulfrance-washington.org/spip.php?article383"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">United States of America</a>. You are also exempted if you have a residence permit from one of these countries or from Andorra or San Marino. If that's your case, you are exempted <em>even if you are not traveling to this country</em>.</p>

<p><strong>If you hold such a visa or residence permit, you can transit without a visa, no matter your citizenship or your destination. If you don't, you will need a visa.</strong></p>

<p>Furthermore, if you just used the visa (so that it's not valid anymore but expired recently), you can still transit without a visa in the Schengen area for the return trip. This rule does not fit US visas very well because it's possible to stay legally in the US long after your visa expired.</p>

<p>Schengen regulations stipulate that holders of expired US visas can transit in the Schengen Area without a visa if returning from the US after having used the visa; however check-in clerks may exercise an overly cautious interpretation regarding US visas expired by a large amount of time, and consequently deny you boarding.</p>

<p>As such, in this case it is highly recommended to get a written confirmation from the ground handling personnel at the airport of departure well in advance, or apply for an airside transit visa for the Schengen Area.</p>

<h2>5. Can I get this visa on arrival?</h2>

<p>No, you cannot. There are provisions for 15-day single-entry visas on arrival in limited cases (mostly seamen, EU citizens' family and emergencies) but it's not regular practice in Europe. If you need a visa, the airline/ground handling personnel at your departure airport will want to see it (they can be fined if they transport you without checking) and they will deny boarding if you don't have the right to transit in the relevant airport(s).</p>

<p>On a general basis it would be advisable to wait for the free shop to buy things you are willing to buy? </p>

<p>Is the price difference really worth the risk of not finding what you are looking for at the airport? or is it just a marketing stunt to get more sales?</p>
","<p>It depends on the item. Alcoholic spirits (whiskey etc) and tobacco are the usual items to get, since they typically are the most heavily taxed items, so can be considerably cheaper at Duty Free than in either country. Usually you'll be able to get all of the major name-brand items, and sometimes some regional items (eg. Jenevers - Dutch gins - if in Amsterdam, or Icelandic spirit Brennivín if departing Reykjavík), but often best not to count on it.</p>

<p>Note that if you purchase spirits you might run into complications with regulations allowing or limiting liquids on flights. Usually you should be fine if it's a non-stop flight, you'll typically get the bottles in a special sealed and marked bag. But it might be trickier if the flight has transfers that include additional security checks; you may or may not have an opportunity to transfer the liquids to checked baggage.</p>

<p>Duty Free stores at airports also tend to have selections of perfumes, jewelry, and some electronics, but I've no idea how good value those are. There's also assorted candy and gifts available. I suspect some of these are often aimed more at guilting a traveller who feels obliged to return with some sort of gift to his/her sweetie or kids rather than actually representing good value.</p>

"Does browsing ticket sites in incognito mode and/or from different IP's result in cheaper ticket prices?","96987","","<p>I stumbled across <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1caomf/what_are_some_useful_secrets_from_your_job_that/c9es3w2"">a discussion</a> yesterday where industry insiders share tips relating to their respective fields. Someone who works in e-commerce stated :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""When purchasing items on the internet (especially airline tickets),
  use incognito mode on your browser. We use your own cookies against
  you: raising the price on tickets the more times you check, as you
  shop around for better deals. That way you'll think the price is going
  up or that seats are being actively sold - thus increasing your
  urgency to buy, and punishing you for trying to get a good deal.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""The point is that it's not enough to just shop around to different
  websites on your own computer anymore. You have to shop around with a
  clean browser, different browsers, different computers, change of IP,
  maybe try from work then RDP to your home computer or somebody on the
  other side of the country, etc. Also, always call the airline directly
  and check on the price - sometimes it's much cheaper.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do these tactics indeed work when purchasing tickets online?</p>
","<p>Yes, these tactics do work. I have experienced, for example, the rising price effect when refreshing a browser window with an itinerary already listed. After the refresh, the price has increased. I opened another browser (Chrome), did the same search and the price was the initial lower price. I refreshed, and the price went up to match that of the original browser (Safari). </p>

<p>If I searched a site or airline site located in a specific country from another country, the price was higher. If I used my VPN to appear as though I am in the country, the price was lower.</p>

<p>This has occurred on Airline specific sites, like AA.com, aircanada.com, flychinaeastern.com, airasia.com, etc., as well as search engines like vayama.com, hipmunk.com. If the price itself hasn't gone up, what happens is that the seat I was looking at supposedly sold out, so I had to look for a different seat, or date. But as I said, doing the same search with a different browser would always return that initial lower price.</p>

<p>That said, this is a lot of rigamarole to go through, and most prices increases were only a couple hundred dollars. If you consider that you might spend several days doing this, you will experience a genuine price increase of more than a couple hundred dollars related to how close you are to the departure date. </p>

<p>I fly several times a year and this always occurs. Of course, my itinerary doesn't change much so I recognize a good deal when it pops up, and just buy it rather than do all the above.</p>

"Why did airport security swab my hands with wet paper?","96781","","<p>Before entering a commercial plane, I had to go through the usual security check at Prague airport (PRG). When I passed the metal detector, it went off. I assume it was because I forgot to take off my wedding ring.</p>

<p>I was approached by the security guy and instead of a full check (which I was expecting), the security guy marked both sides of my hands with some piece of wet paper, told me ""wait there"", left with that paper (maybe checking something with the paper, I do not know exactly) and after some time he told me I was free to proceed to the Duty Free zone behind the security check.</p>

<p>While relieved, I am wondering: Does anyone have a clue what kind of security check was that?</p>
","<p>Often at security they swab my backpack and some of my possessions with a small piece of damp paper. It is supposed to pick up traces of the materials I've been handling. Then they put it in a machine that analyzes those traces. At customs and immigration it's set to detect various illicit drugs (I've seen this on Border Security) but at security I believe it's set to detect explosives.</p>

<p>Certain people are chosen randomly for a swab. Since you had no residue on your hands that would require them to inspect you further, they sent you on your way. This wasn't caused by you leaving a ring on. Leaving a wedding ring on is fine.</p>

"Is weed still legal for tourists in Amsterdam?","96466","","<p>I have heard it's not legal starting from 2013. I also heard they postponed applying this? </p>

<p>So what's the deal? Allowed or not?</p>
","<p>It has always been illegal and people have been arrested for smoking it in the open. I always love the faces of the tourists being arrested at Schiphol airport or in front of the Central station in Amsterdam for smoking weed. It is a global misconception that in Amsterdam it is as free as smoking cigarettes on the street. The principle has always been, what is called ""Gedogen"", which means that it is tolerated as long as you don't use it in the open and don't create annoyances. It is the Dutch way of dealing with social problems. It is similar to the so-called ""afwerkplekken"" for street prostitution. These are designated area's where street prostitution is tolerated. When ever there is a social problem that is hard to eradicate, the Dutch approach is encapsulate it in known zones, relieving other area's from problems related to that social problem.  </p>

<p>In the seventies the Dutch government introduced so called ""coffeeshops"", which are designated establishments where cannabis use is tolerated. Again recognize the difference between tolerated and allowed. </p>

<p>What has changed recently is the legal status for these coffeeshops. They are now only allowed as a member-only organization for local residents. To get access to a coffeeshop you need to register as a member providing proof you live in the same city. The change of this regulation was guided by the pressure from Belgium and Germany. Border cities like Maastricht, Roosendaal, Terneuzen were like magnets to weed smokers from France, Belgium and Germany, causing problems in those cities and the surrounding countries. This was the reason behind introducing the member-only requirement for coffeeshops. This is also why the weed-pass as it is informally called was first introduced in the border regions and later imposed on other cities like Amsterdam. As Mark already said, again some cities like Amsterdam chose not to spent resources on enforcing this.
Border cities did introduce the legislation to require the member-only status of coffeeshops, with the effect that most coffeeshops did close. </p>

"Can a tourist buy a gun in the USA?","95751","","<p>This came up as a discussion.  With recent incidents in the news, it's often argued by some members of the public in the US that guns are a requirement for safety, and that everyone should have the right to own a gun.</p>

<p>Obviously, they're talking about citizens.  However, if a tourist visits, surely they should have the same concerns (arguably more, since you don't know as much as locals).</p>

<p>Anyway, the question that is being asked here (and I'm trying to avoid politics as best as possible) - can a <strong>non-resident</strong> tourist buy a gun for their travels around the United States?</p>
","<p>Very simply, no, they can not.</p>

<p>In order to purchase a firearm in the US you must be a resident of the state in which you are buying it, and able to prove that residency.  As a tourist is not a resident of the state, they are unable to purchase firearms.</p>

<p>There was previously an additional requirement that non-citizens had to have been a resident of a state for 90 days before they could purchase a firearm in that state, but that additional condition was removed earlier this year.</p>

<p>Even if you could purchase a firearm, doing so for ""travels around the United States"" would be troublesome as gun laws vary from state to state, so what is legal in one state could be illegal in another.</p>

What about international flights leaving from the US? Are there general rules for times of day or days of the week when airports tend to be busier and it would be wise to arrive earlier?</p>
","<p>The general rule of thumb is that one is supposed to arrive </p>

<ul>
<li>2 hours early for a domestic flight and </li>
<li>3 for an international flight.  </li>
</ul>

<p>That said, I've never found that rule to be terribly useful because it doesn't take into account size of the airport, day of the week, or anything like that. </p>

<p>Personally, I also find the times to be a little bit excessive - I figure on</p>

<ul>
<li>45 - 90 minutes domestically</li>
<li>2 hours international</li>
</ul>

<p>I've never missed a plane (although once, going to Bermuda, they had to hold a plane for me!)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Allow more time for larger airports (<a href=""/questions/tagged/iad"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;iad&#39;"" rel=""tag"">iad</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/sfo"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;sfo&#39;"" rel=""tag"">sfo</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/jfk"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;jfk&#39;"" rel=""tag"">jfk</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/ohr"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;ohr&#39;"" rel=""tag"">ohr</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/atl"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;atl&#39;"" rel=""tag"">atl</a>, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Allow more time for international flights (obviously)</p></li>
<li><p>Allow more time on Monday mornings, Thursday evenings, or any time on Friday, Saturday, or Sunday before about 4pm.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow less time if you have access to a priority security line (usually due to a frequent flyer program)</p></li>

<p>Will the hotel accept another credit card (not the card I used to book with) on check in?</p>
","<p>There are generally 2 types of hotel bookings you can make :</p>

<ul>
<li>Pre-paid</li>
<li>Guaranteed by credit card</li>
</ul>

<p>""Pre-paid"" is where you have fully paid for the hotel in advance. Your credit card has been charged, and there is nothing more to pay other than incidents (minibar, room service, etc).  They will still ask for a credit card at check-in, but this is only for the incidentals.</p>

<p>""Guaranteed by credit card"" is where you've actually paid nothing, but you have given your credit card to guarantee the room.  In the event that you don't show up, they will charge a fee to your credit card to make up for the no-show.  In this case the credit card you give at check-in (and/or check-out) will be used to for the room charge - regardless of what card was used to make the booking.</p>

<p>Where this can get confusing is that some hotels will advertise a ""pre-paid"" or ""advance purchase"" rate, but not actually charge it to your card in advance - so whilst this will appear to be a pre-paid booking, it's actually not.</p>

<p>As a general rule, if you book through the hotel themselves (their website, call center, etc) then they will use the card supplied at check-in.  If you book through a third party website (eg, Expedia, Orbitz, etc) then you will be charged at the time you make your booking <em>unless</em> they explicitly say otherwise (ie, they state that you will pay at the hotel).  However whilst this is a good rule of thumb, there's no guarantee that it'll actually work this way!</p>

"Is Morocco currently safe to visit despite the Ebola outbreak?","81521","","<p>I'm travelling to Morocco over the Easter period, and while I am aware that the current Ebola outbreak is mainly in Guinea, Liberia and Mali, and would have to cross the Sahara to get to Morocco, is it wise for me to go to Morocco at this time?</p>

<p>What are some basic precautions I can take in the case that the Ebola virus travels to Morocco?</p>
","<p><em>(Disclaimer: I'm not a doctor, etc)</em> </p>

<p>Ebola is not contagious in the same way as, say, influenza outbreaks. </p>

<p>It's a horrible contagious disease, but it requires <strong>an exchange of bodily fluids</strong> for transmission - particularly blood, sweat, sexual fluids, vomit, bile etc. Transmission usually occurs in close proximity - between family members, sexual partners or others sharing accommodation, through medical contact, or contact with improperly-treated deceased. </p>

<p><strong>Check your own government's travel advice</strong>: but for an example, the (very cautious) UK government are currently <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/guinea"">not even warning people against travel to <em>Guinea</em></a> let alone Morocco - here's their <a href=""http://www.nathnac.org/travel/news/ebola_westafrica_030414.htm"">specific health advice on Ebola in Guinea</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The risk to most travellers is very low... Transmission of Ebola can only occur when there is direct contact with the blood or body fluids of an infected person, animal, or objects, such as needles, that have been contaminated with blood or body fluids. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>As for Morocco</strong>, not only is it the other side of the Sahara to the Ebola outbreak, the areas between (Northern Mali, Western Sahara, South West Algeria) are unstable barely populated areas with banditry and very little travel or trade. If ebola was to spread to Morocco, it would almost certainly be by plane travel, which is a) closely monitored and b) no more likely to arrive at Morocco than any other country that flies to Guinea.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Those Ebola horror stories from the past that people love to share</strong>, of terrifyingly fast-spreading outbreaks, usually involve poorly prepared hospitals and communities responding in ways that aid transmission, such as re-using needles, traditional burial practices such as embalming bodies, and treating the sick without taking appropriate precautions. There have been major efforts since then to ensure medical facilities are better trained.</p>

<p>You'll see from news reports that even in the countries most effected, the numbers of people affected are (so far, touch wood) low.</p>

<p>If you were going to one of the country where there <em>were</em> some cases of ebola and you were worried, these might be sensible precautions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Take similar precautions as you would to avoid HIV infection (no unsafe sex or shared needle use, avoid other exchanges of bodily fluids)</li>
<li>Consider additional precautions to avoid exchanging sweat. Maybe skip the gym. </li>
<li>If you're exceptionally worried or there were reports of medium-sized outbreaks while there, and you wanted to feel like you were being extra-cautious: 
<ul>
<li>you might want to make more effort to maintain personal space and maybe avoid skin contact such as shaking hands,</li>
<li>you might want to wash your hands more than usual and consider using <a href=""http://www.examiner.com/article/hand-sanitizers-offer-little-protection-so-what-does"">hand sanitizers after</a> physical contact with people or things that have been in close contact to other people before touching food or your face,</li>
<li>...but even these might be a bit excessive unless you were right in an outbreak, in which case there would probably be an evacuation plan.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>I'll end with a quote in the USA Today article <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/04/06/ebola-virus-west-africa/7314875/"">As Ebola spreads in Africa, how worried should I be?</a> from a director of virology at the U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""You probably couldn't get Ebola if you went to Conakry [capital of Guinea] now if you tried""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it was me, I'd keep an eye on the news, and I'd take normal health precautions, but wouldn't let worries spoil the trip.</p>

  <p>You may transport this item in carry-on baggage or in checked baggage. For items you wish to carry-on, you should check with the airline to ensure that the item will fit in the overhead bin or underneath the seat of the airplane.</p>
  
  <p>To help officers get a clear look at your bag and reduce the need for additional screening, we suggest you pack your bag in neat layers (layer of clothes, layer of electronics, layer of clothes, layer of shoes, etc.) and wrap cords tightly around electronics items. </p>
  
  <p>Even if an item is generally permitted, it may be subject to additional screening or not allowed through the checkpoint if it triggers an alarm during the screening process, appears to have been tampered with, or poses other security concerns. The final decision rests with TSA on whether to allow any items on the plane.</p>

<h3>Travelling with LIPOs</h3>

<p>Obviously there are substantial technological differences between serious quadcopter drones and toy rc helicopters, which will most likely cause these two items to be treated very differently by airport security. The most important difference is arguably the battery used to power the former. <a href=""http://www.dronethusiast.com/traveling-with-lipo-batteries-drone/"">This article from Drone Enthusiast contains a plethora of useful information on the topic.</a> Of interest is the section on LIPO batteries which reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>Checked-in or Carry-on?</h3>
  
  <p>First of all it is very important that LiPo batteries MUST be carried on with you on board the aircraft and CAN NOT be placed in checked in luggage! Swift change in temperature and air pressure make LiPo batteries susceptible to catching fire. </p>
  
  <p>[...]</p>
  
  <p>I have been reading threads of discussion online debating if you should declare that you are traveling with LiPo-s when passing through the security inspection. Some reported having no problems even when questioned about the nature of the batteries and even friendly TSA personnel asking them if it is fun to fly quadcopters.  At the same time, any Lithium based battery pack falls under IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations involving the shipment of lithium-based batteries on passenger and cargo aircraft. So if you use common sense, you must agree that not declaring things that are classified as dangerous goods is NOT a good idea. You can stretch your luck but don’t think that your LiPo-s will not be seen during screening. Also, please don’t blame me if you follow my advice and still get declined to travel with your batteries. If it happens, it will definitely not be because you declared them.</p>
  
  <h3>Quantities</h3>
  
  <p>The quantity permitted is based on watt-hours (Wh). Wh establishes the lithium content by multiplying voltage with the ampere-hours (Ah). For example, 14.40V x 5Ah battery = 72Wh.</p>
  
  <p>The current IATA dangerous goods regulations and your rights as passenger to carry the LiPos with you in carry-on luggage but not in your checked luggage. There are 3 classes of LiPo batteries. Below 100Wh there are no quantity restrictions as to the amount of batteries you can carry. Between 100Wh and 160Wh you are limited to two battery packs total per passenger. Above 160Wh you are not permitted to carry the packs as carry-on.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Carry-on Drones</h3>

<p>Followed by the section on  transporting the drone as your carry-on luggage which can be summarised as: <strong>put the drone in a hard case and check if its size fits into the airline limitations for carry-on</strong>. Another important piece of advice is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>Remove Anything Sharp</h3>
  
  <p>This might not occur to you automatically, but what you are taking aboard is still a carry-on bag and traveling with lipo batteries on board is not the only possible hazard in the eyes of safety folks. So you WILL need to remove any and all sharp objects such as screwdrivers, blades, scissors also. I would also recommend removing the rotor blades also and placing them in check-in luggage, specially if they are the more rigid and sharp carbon ones.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All in all it is not very common to see people carrying drones as hand luggage hence you should expect a few more questions than usual from airport security officers. In my opinion if you pack the item properly, respect the rules for LIPO batteries, and cross security checks with a smile on your face and an attitude towards explaining what it is you're carrying you should be fine. As usual YMMV and ultimately it is the officer screening you who has the last word on what is and isn't allowed beyond security checkpoints. </p>

"Can I pack a cardboard box as checked luggage?","78608","","<p>As mentioned in <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/3748/flying-with-a-desktop-computer-as-checked-luggage"">another question</a>, I'm planning on traveling with a desktop computer as checked baggage. After considering the options, I've decided to take it in its original cardboard box (used for shipping), making sure to pad everything inside very well.</p>

<p>What should I do to securely prepare the box before checking it in? Some suggestions others have given me so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>Spray paint the box black so it's not obvious there's a computer inside.</li>
<li>Wrap the entire box with duct tape to reinforce it.</li>
<li>Use tape to seal the ""hand holes"" on either side used for carrying the box.</li>
<li>Run packing tape around all the edges to reinforce the box.</li>
<li><a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/3984/what-do-fragile-stickers-on-checked-baggage-do"">Write ""FRAGILE"" on multiple sides of the box.</a></li>
</ul>
","<p>I've used cardboard boxes as checked luggage several times, including to transport desktop computers twice.</p>

<p>Most likely the airline will make you sign a waiver that you accept all responsibility for any damage, but otherwise you'll have no issues as long as it's within the allowed weight/size guidelines (which if it's just a computer, it will be).</p>

<p>I didn't bother with any extra padding/etc, on the basis that the original foam in the box fitted the computer perfectly.  I did make a point to wrap the computer completely in plastic (eg, the plastic bags that they normally come in, or something similar) and then seal the bag with tape in an effort to make it somewhat waterproof - obviously not enough that it's going to handle getting dunked in water, but enough that it'll survive getting rained on whilst they are loading/unloading the plane.</p>

<p><a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/3984/what-do-fragile-stickers-on-checked-baggage-do"">Fragile stickers certainly wont hurt</a> - I actually use ""fragile"" tape that you can get from Office Depot or similar and just run it around the box a few times.</p>

<p>If possible, try and pick flights that are on a wide-body aircraft (747, A340, etc) as cargo on those is generally treated a little better than on narrow-body aircraft where it's manually loaded into the hold, rather than being loaded in crates.</p>

<p>And just remember that at the destination airport you'll probably need to go to the ""oversized"" baggage area to collect it rather than getting it on the normal luggage belt.</p>

<p>Update: I once again traveled with a checked-in box from the USA to Australia just before Christmas. On this occasion the box was opened by the TSA for a security check - however I'm happy to say that they did an excellent job of opening and re-sealing the box.  Other than the note they put in the box and the fragile tape obviously being cut there was no other indication that it had been opened.  Everything was still packed exactly as I had left it, and they had sealed the box just as well as I had.</p>

"Can others in my party go through TSA PreCheck?","78393","","<p>If I have <a href=""https://www.tsa.gov/tsa-precheck"">TSA PreCheck</a> (i.e. I have a KTN from TSA and the ""pre-check"" logo gets printed on my boarding pass) and a travel companion does not, can they go with me through the PreCheck security lines? This is assuming that the travel companion is booked in the same reservation on the same flights and is also a U.S. citizen and not on any no-fly or otherwise increased scrutiny lists.</p>

<p>I'm guessing the answer is no, but I haven't seen anything from TSA specifically addressing this.</p>
","<p>According to <a href=""https://www.tsa.gov/tsa-precheck/apply"">TSA.gov</a>, the FAQ says <strong>no</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m traveling with my family; can they also use the TSA Pre✓<sub>®</sub> lane?</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Family members ages 12 and under traveling with an eligible parent or guardian with a TSA Pre✓<sub>®</sub> indicator on their boarding pass can participate in expedited screening.  </li>
  <li>Family members 13 and older must go through standard security lanes or should apply for a DHS trusted traveler program.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I know your question isn't about family, but 'travel companions', but seeing as they don't even allow family members over 13 to join you on your KTN, it can safely be assumed by a reasonable person (and yes, I know we're talking TSA here, irony noted) that a non-family member would also not be eligible to travel under your KTN.</p>

"When I purchase flights with an online travel agent, is there an ""e-ticket"" I must print out?","78147","","<p>I've always bought my tickets through travel agents in the past but this time I've bought two flights on two different websites.</p>

<p>Now in the emails they've sent me there is my itinerary but also quite a bit of ""junk"" like hotel offers.</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure I should take some printout to the airport, the ones I got from real travel agents were very clean, looking like typed sheets of info. Also in those cases I thought there were two kinds of printouts with one being the itinerary and the other being the more important one you need to have at the airport - but I can't remember exactly any more.</p>

<p>Another important factor is that both tickets are one-way flights. I want to be prepared to use a printout of the home leg as proof that I'm leaving in the case that immigration might ask me to produce it at the intermediate leg. (I'm spending six weeks in Korea on my way home to Australia from Turkey.)</p>

<p>I'm really confused as to whether the pages I printed out are the best ones, or if I missed something important with all the distracting ads. The two websites I used are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""http://www.expedia.com.au""><code>Expedia.com.au</code></a></p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://www.ebookers.com/"">ebookers UK</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Or could it be I'm worrying about nothing and all I need when I get to the airport is my name and the airlines will find me in their database? Even with one-way flights?</p>
","<p>Technically speaking, almost all airlines can serve you well without any tickets or PNRs (passenger number record or booking reference) as long as you have bought the ticket and made reservation regardless of the method of buying. All they need is your name and a valid ID (passport in international flights) and they can get you the boarding pass. Even the self service kiosks for many airlines have the option to serve you by scanning your passport (to get your name from the bar code). </p>

<p>Anyway, to be prepared for the worst keep the itinerary number with you (or PNR) just in case. If the itinerary is paid for then the ticket number will be attached to it and it will usually have the form <code>ETKT xxx-xxxxxxx</code> or something similar. You can print the itinerary at home which will be enough proof to show to the authorities or you can ask the counter at the airport to print it for you. </p>

<p>The only time you might need to print the E-ticket and keep a copy of it (or at least keep the ticket number) is when you have a ticket without reservation (they call it open ticket). In this case the ticket will have the sectors shown but with no flight numbers or dates. The open tickets are usually expensive because you have the flexibility to fly on any flight as in the ticket at any time.</p>

"How can I wash myself Indian-style (using water not toilet paper) in Western toilets?","77458","","<p>As an Indian I have grown up in Delhi using water to wash after using the toilet instead of toilet paper. In Indian culture this is considered a cleaner practice because of the use of water in order to wash the privates instead of toilet paper which may leave a residue.</p>

<p>Although I was able to comfortably adjust with the toilet paper system, many Indian people find it quite difficult and ""dirty"".</p>

<p>Are there any tips for a traveler to appropriately conduct themselves while fulfilling their wish of using water instead of toilet paper.

<p>They start popping up in the Balkans and of course they're everywhere by the time you get to Turkey and become totally unavoidable no matter how patient you are or how long you can hold on when you're anywhere between about India and Japan.</p>

<p><strong>Asian toilets AKA squat toilets</strong> - Do you know how to use one if you have to?</p>

<p>Seems simple. There's the grippy bits on the sides and the hole in the middle. I wonder which direction I should face...</p>

<p>So let's give it a try...</p>

<p>Trousers down just like at home...</p>

<p>Squat down like the name says...</p>

<p>But now my trousers seem to be blocking an important thoroughfare! How the hell is this supposed to work??!!</p>

<p>There's no way to keep one's balance in a position where your weight is not over your feet and when your weight is over your feet so are your pesky trousers.</p>

<p>Now I'm pretty sure the locals don't remove their trousers because there's almost never a hook and the floor is often flooded. Exiting with wet trouser cuffs or socks wet from the toilet floor surely can't be socially acceptable!</p>

<p>And I'm completely utterly sure they don't wipe the porcelain and sit down making believe they're in the west because that would be dirty!</p>

<p>Well I'm here to say that after plenty of trips to plenty of countries with plenty of oriental eastern Asian toilets I've used both of these unsatisfactory workarounds but I still want to know one thing...</p>

<p><strong>What on earth is the proper way to use a squat toilet??</strong></p>
","<p>:D</p>

<p>I grew up using that thing. When I went studying abroad, I had problems with the toilet you guys called as the normal one (the sitting one). I literally wet my pants several times. Probably I should start a post about ""How to sit on the normal toilet"".</p>

<p>Here are just some extra tips so you don't wet your pants on a squatting toilet.</p>

<ul>
<li>I will suggest you to take out everything from your pant's pockets before you squat.</li>
<li>Don't pull your pants too low. Leave it above your knees. So, when you squatted, it doesn't interfere with the important thoroughfare.</li>
<li>The toilet hole is where the poop should go, so that's where you should aim your ass, right above it if you can.</li>
<li>If you don't have toilet paper, just use the water to clean it. Be careful not to wet your pant. Be sure to use your <strong>dominant</strong> hand to hold the pipe or bucket and only the other hand for cleaning. After that you clean your hands. :) And after that, prevent using your non-dominant hand to interact with other people. In some places like Indonesia, it's rude to use your left hand for interaction. And I believe you know why already. </li>
<li>Your legs will be numbed if you've squatted for too long. Just for your information.</li>

"Can an airline change a reservation booked through Expedia?","77042","","<p>If I book my flight through Expedia, can the airline make changes to that reservation (e.g. if I wanted to change my return date), or do I have to call Expedia directly?</p>
","<p>Yes, the airline <strong>can</strong> make changes to a ticket issued by a 3rd party.</p>

<p>Whether they <strong>will</strong> make changes is a different matter.</p>

<p>In general, the ticket is deemed to be 'owned' by whoever booked it - generally either the airline itself, or a 3rd party travel agency. That party is the one that has been paid to issue the ticket, and is generally responsible for making any changes at least up until the start of the first flight.</p>

<p>So in general, any changes - at least before the start of travel - will need to be made by Expedia.</p>

<p>Some airlines do give you the option for them to ""take over"" the ticket so that they can make changes, however (at least in the US) they will generally charge you for doing this.  eg, the <a href=""https://www.united.com/web/format/pdf/Contract_of_Carriage.pdf"">United Airlines Contract of Carriage</a> states :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>UA will assess a 50.00 USD/50.00 CAD fee to assist with a voluntary
  change on tickets originally issued via any external ticketing source
  (travel agency, internet agency, other airline, etc.). The fee is
  non-refundable and applies in addition to all applicable charges.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>American Airlines call it a ""<a href=""http://www.aa.com/i18n/agency/Booking_Ticketing/Ticketing/external_fee.jsp"">External Reservation Handling Charge</a>"", along with a US$25-35 fee.</p>

<p>This fee may be waived if you are a high-level frequent flyer, or potentially if you are on a high fare ticket - but often that's at the discretion of the phone agent.</p>

<p>You can always try calling the airline, especially as every airline has slightly different policies, but for something like a change of date of a flight I would not expect them to assist you without paying this fee.  If your travel has already commenced then you might have more success.</p>

"When to book tickets from travel sites rather than airline sites?","75854","","<p>When booking plane tickets, I generally buy directly from the airline's website (as it is often the lowest or near-lowest price for the destinations I travel between). However, I know there are many other travel sites like Expedia, Travelocity, or Kayak.</p>

<p>When does it make sense to buy from one of those sites instead of direct, and what are the pros and cons of tickets purchased through them?</p>
","<p>For domestic flights in the US, the cheapest price is almost always on the airline's website. Additionally, airlines sometimes include other benefits like additional frequent flyer miles, reduced baggage fees etc. for booking directly through their site.</p>

<p>Online travel agents such as Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz etc. can sometimes find flight combinations that you cannot book directly through a single airline. This can be useful when there is no single airline (or airline alliance) that serves your route. This is not common for domestic trips, but can happen sometimes for international flights between more minor destinations.</p>

<p>There is also the convenience of using a single site with all your information already stored instead of having to navigate a different a airline site every time you make a reservation. This can be especially useful for foreign airline websites which are sometimes more difficult to use and can be troublesome with foreign credit cards.</p>

<p>Finally, if you book through an online travel site, they become your ""agent"" and can take care of things such as cancellations, schedule changes etc. You might find it more convenient to speak to an English speaking customer service agent on a 1-800 number than calling a foreign airline which may not have a toll-free number or even a number at all in the USA.</p>

"Indian Trains Wait List - will I get a seat?","75351","","<p>After the <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/9562/where-to-book-indian-train-tickets-online"">fiasco</a> of registering an account to book train tickets online using my British VISA card, I finally got into a position of being able to book a ticket, but what it appears to be telling me is that I'm only being added to a wait list, which I assume means my tickets aren't confirmed.</p>

<p>Can someone explain how the wait list works, and what my chances are of getting on the train successfully? </p>

<ul>
<li>It currently says the wait list is 7</li>
<li>The train is the Mandor Express, from Delhi to Jodhpur on the 18th of Nov</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> So I got the train! Although it didn't get confirmed until a few hours before it was due to leave. </p>
","<p>The wait list system for Indian train tickets is simply a case of supply and demand - there's so many people wanting to travel and only so many seats to go around. So there are three 'booking statuses' which may be specified when you book a train ticket:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Reserved / confirmed</strong>: The booking is confirmed and a seat has been set aside for you. Note that the specific seat may NOT be specified on your ticket even if your ticket is confirmed. This is because the final seating charts are sometimes decided an hour or two before the train departure. More on how to check the final status of your ticket below.</li>
<li><strong>RAC (reservation against cancellation)</strong>: An RAC ticket is a status just above a wait listed ticket, and means you get converted to  a confirmed seat in case of a no show by someone else. In most cases, RAC tickets do get converted to confirmed and you can often at least get on the train with an RAC ticket.</li>
<li><strong>Waitlisted</strong>: You cannot get on the train unless the final chart before departure confirms that your seat has been reserved. It's a first-in, first-out queue of people waiting to get a seat.</li>
</ul>

<p>The reason for this system is that due to demand, many people book tickets months in advance. Due to this - planning months in advance - many people's travel plans do often change and some people cancel their tickets. Hence, the waitlist system allows you to book a ticket and then wait in queue to be next in line for a reserved seat.</p>

<p>Now I mentioned that even with a confirmed ticket, the seat number / coach number might not be mentioned. Regardless of what the ticket says (confirmed / RAC / waitlist), final seating charts are published and put up on notice boards in stations which list the final passenger manifest. You can also check this online (<a href=""http://www.indianrailways.in/pnrstatus"">using the Indian Railways PNR status page</a>) or the automated telephone line mentioned on the back of your ticket. </p>

<p>As a rule of thumb, if your waitlist number is in the range of 10-20, depending on how busy in the season it is, there is a high chance of your ticket getting confirmed. Because the final charts are not published until a few hours before departure, you might have to wait till quite late to find out - but if it's in single digits, then it's almost always true that your ticket gets confirmed.</p>

<p>If you really want to be sure, a certain percentage of tickets on every train is set aside for short-notice bookings (called '<a href=""http://www.indianrail.gov.in/tatkal_Scheme.html"">Tatkal</a>' tickets) which open at 10am, 24 hours before departure. These tickets cost slightly more than normal tickets but give you the flexibility to make bookings at short notice. If your waitlist number is double digits, it makes sense to keep checking the online system to see how quickly your waitlist number is reducing which will give you an idea of whether you're moving up in queue or not, i.e., a lower numeric waitlist number - and if it doesn't seem to be progressing in the final few days before the journey, then to cancel the original ticket and get a Tatkal ticket instead. </p>

Although I have no personal experience with it, I think it's an interesting option that I would certainly like to try out some day. The information below is fully based on what I have read on the internet.</p>

<p>In freighter travel, you get to travel on-board a freighter. Those freighters take only a handful of passengers, typically a dozen or so. You need to entertain yourself. The freighter has a particular route and you can join either the whole way, or from port to port. You may need to pay a not inconsiderable amount of money to use such an unusual port of entry in the United States. Your luck is that transatlantic freighter travel is one of the most popular routes.</p>

<p>You might pay around US$1500. This cannot be directly compared against an airfare, because for this price includes all meals and lodging. For some routes, the prices are in US$/day plus a base fee. </p>

Will the customs officer in India (Chennai) give any trouble if I carry two new unopened smart phones with the box in my hand luggage? Also, i'm a student, does this give me any advantage over it?</p>
","<p>The situation is a little complicated and there a few things you must consider. First of all I'm going to tell you about all the <strong>legal prospects</strong> of this situation and what can happen if then open up your bags and find two packaged phones inside.</p>

<p>Take a look at this <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/a/10996/12160"">great answer</a> already posted here. Now, since these are two packaged phones, despite being underneath your limit of Rs. 33000, they are items which can be re-purposed by anyone else which quite honestly is what you are doing here because of the fact that you are giving them to your parents. Even though you don't plan to sell them, you <strong>still</strong> won't take them back with you, so they are <strong>technically imported into the country</strong>.</p>

<p>Now, one second thought, you could take the phones out of the packages and put them either in your suitcase or your hand-luggage.</p>

<p>Now, is this fool-proof? <strong>Obviously No.</strong> And the reason it isn't is because you <em>are</em> importing things into the country and if they ask you to pay import duty on it, your only argument can be, ""Hey these are for my own use!"" Now, if the two phones are packaged, this argument is far less convincing. Otherwise they might let you thru without much issue.</p>

<p>Keeping this in mind, <strong>if the phones are in your hand luggage and are not packaged, you should be fine</strong>. If you decide to take them in your luggage without the packaging or packaging separately in different luggage or something, that would be pretty fine too! <strong>If you do decide to take them as packaged goods, that's up to your own risk</strong>.</p>

"What is the best strategy to exchange money to GBP in London?","71308","","<p>I know this question said about London which where I live right now, but I think it's applied everywhere. </p>

<p>I have almost 900 Euros left which I want to change back to pound sterling.  So, I googled a little bit and I found this website <a href=""http://travelmoney.moneysavingexpert.com/buy-back/"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://travelmoney.moneysavingexpert.com/buy-back/</a></p>

<p>which will tell me where can I get the most out of my money. But is the top one legit? The difference I found is almost 50 pounds compared to local bank (Natwest).  But the top one I have to order online which I haven't used it before.  So I would like to learn from other people. How do you guys exchange money in London to get most out of it?</p>
","<p>The best strategy is to go as far away as possible from tourist areas to exchange money. Currency Exchange at the airport is generally the worst, followed money changers in tourist areas. Then start to look at money changers in London's financial district, ie the City. Generally, they will be competing with other money changers and making their money on volume. </p>

<p>Also, people in the City will know what the rate should be. You are also very unlikely to be ripped off. The City is also safer if you are carrying large amounts of cash. (Not applicable to you, but in general it's good to know).</p>

<p>The really good deals are via Corporate money changing but you are unlikely to be able to setup an account unless you have a business.</p>

<p>Look around at lunch time and see which money changers have a queue. These are the ones to go to. I tend to use www.cityforex.co.uk for this reason.</p>

<p>In general, this guide can be used for other countries / cities.</p>

"What's a ""Redress Control Number""?","70546","","<p>When booking a flight reservation recently, I noted it had a non-compulsory field asking for a Redress Control Number for your reservation.</p>

<p>I gather this is somewhat related to the No Fly list, but was wondering if someone could explain how it works and whether it just gets accepted and you're waived through at the gate, or whether it still requires you get some thorough investigation as a result :)</p>
","<p>Redress Control Number is used to help travelers who have been denied or delayed airline boarding; have been denied or delayed entry into or exit from the U.S. at a port of entry or border crossing; or have been repeatedly referred to additional (secondary) screening.</p>

<p>Airlines will modify their reservation systems to accept the 7 digits redress number to allow passengers with redress numbers to enter it during the reservation. This is a part of the <a href=""http://www.tsa.gov/what_we_do/layers/secureflight/"">Secure Flight Program</a>.</p>

<p>Regarding how this works, the Redress Control Number (redress number) allows Secure Flight to match travelers with the results of their redress case to prevent them from going through the above mentioned scenarios. From <a href=""http://www.tsa.gov/what_we_do/layers/secureflight/"">Secure Flight Program website:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The airline submits this information to Secure Flight, which uses it to perform watch list matching. This serves to prevent individuals on the No Fly List from boarding an aircraft and to identify individuals on the Selectee List for enhanced screening. After matching passenger information against government watch lists, Secure Flight transmits the matching results back to airlines so they can issue passenger boarding passes.</p>

"Vehicles required/allowed in weigh stations on US interstates","69615","","<p>On US interstates, there are weigh stations for trucks.</p>

<p>Are they for trucks only? What are the exact categories of vehicles that must/may enter?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If I rented a UHaul or Penske truck, would I be required to enter into an open weigh station? I know that, when a speed limit sign says <code>70 Trucks 60</code>, UHaul, Penske or large motorhomes are limited to 60 mph. Does that mean that they also need to submit to weigh stations?</p></li>
<li><p>If I drove a 30 - 50 ft motor-home, would I need to go through the weigh station?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>What dimensions or attributes of a vehicle would require it to submit to weigh stations?</p>
","<p>The short answer is <strong>yes</strong>, larger trucks like moving trucks will be required to go through a weigh station <strong>in some states</strong>; AAA has a guide to <a href=""http://drivinglaws.aaa.com/laws/weigh-stations/"">weigh station requirements in Canada and the United States</a>, and you should also ask the agency you are renting from.</p>

<p>You will not necessarily have to <em>stop</em> at the weigh station for an inspection, as modern weigh stations have rolling scales— or you may simply be waved through by the agent or officer. Sometimes, there is even a special lane for moving trucks. But it is better to be safe than sorry, as the ticket for failing to stop at a weigh station when required can be costly.</p>

<hr>

<p>To generalize, most states require only 1) commercial vehicles, of which your rented moving truck or pickup would not be included, and 2) vehicles over a certain weight, again, which your rented moving truck or pickup is unlikely to exceed, to stop at weigh stations. Some explicitly include or exclude trailers, motor homes / recreational vehicles (RVs), or campers.</p>

<p>The most common limits are 8,000, 10,000 lbs and 26,000 lbs <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_vehicle_weight_rating"">Gross Vehicle Weight Rating</a> (GVWR). It is extremely unlikely that a motorhome or a moving truck of personal goods would exceed 26,000 lbs., which is a common level at which a commercial driver's license is required.</p>

<p>But many of the larger trucks you can rent from Penske, U-Haul, and so forth would fall under the regulation. The <a href=""http://www.movers.com/truck-rental-guides/weigh-station-regulations-for-rental-trucks.html"">Movers.com Weigh Stations page</a> offers the following table of approximate gross vehicle weights:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>14-foot has GVW of 14,050 pounds</li>
  <li>17-foot has GVW of 14,050 pounds</li>
  <li>24-foot has GVW of 18,000 pounds</li>

"Should I submit bank statements when applying for a UK Visa? What do they say about me?","69194","","<p>The UK Visas and Immigration Directorate publishes <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/423699/2015_04_20_Visitor_Supporting_Documents_Guide_-_Final__2__-_CLEAN.pdf"">guidance</a> that provides helpful tips that can result in successful visa applications. Section 2 of this guidance opens is entitled ""other documents you <strong>may</strong> want to provide"" (emphasis mine).</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>Section 2: other documents you may want to provide&nbsp;&ndash; all visitors</h2>
  
  <p>This section provides guidance on the types of documents that you may want to provide to help us consider your application against the Immigration Rules.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Previous travel documents/passports</strong>, which show previous travel.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Financial documents</strong> showing that you have sufficient funds available.  These must clearly show that you have access to the funds, such as:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>(Note 'eg' is a Latin abbreviation meaning ""for
example""; this appears to be optional rather than a fixed requirement.)</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> How should someone interpret this such that the chances of success are maximized? How many statements should I submit? What are they looking for and what do my bank statements tell about me?</p>
","<h1>What Is the Purpose of Bank Statements?</h1>

<p>At first principles bank statements show that the applicant has the financial capacity to visit the UK. However there is a lot more to it and it's not just about the current balance.  Bank statements help the decision-maker understand the applicant's personal circumstances...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Stability and lifestyle, most importantly regular cash flows in to the account from employment.</p></li>
<li><p>The relationship between the applicant's cash flows and their stated employment.</p></li>
<li><p>Sources of income that will be paid in to the account while the applicant is visiting the UK.</p></li>
<li><p>The consistency of the applicant's lifestyle to their proposed maintenance and accommodation in the UK during their visit. </p></li>
<li><p>Sources of income from the applicant's family and any financial commitments between family members that demonstrate closeness to family.</p></li>
<li><p>If the applicant is using a sponsor, a history of support, i.e., regular deposits that can improve the sponsor's credibility and willingness to support the applicant.</p></li>
<li><p>Ongoing financial commitments the applicant has such as rent or mortgage payments.</p></li>
<li><p>Ongoing expenditures for food, utilities, transportation and so on.</p></li>
<li><p>That all income has been lawfully generated and are actually available to the applicant during their visit.</p></li>
<li><p>Ongoing support and maintenance for the applicant's dependants, especially those who are not travelling with the applicant.</p></li>
<li><p>Irregular cash flows and sudden changes in the account balance that may indicate the applicant is using a funds parking strategy.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>And most importantly, the applicant's connections to the local economy and society along with connections to the applicant's family.</strong></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Bank statements that exhibit two or more of these characteristics will be more successful than those that do not. While there is no strict rule about how many statements are needed, it's plain to see that with more statements the decision-maker will be able to see the patterns.  The rule of thumb is six statements over a period of six months and the six month period should end with the most recent statement prior to submitting the application.</p>

<p>Some people can establish most of the above with three to six months of account history, but first-time applicants and those with borderline cases should submit more. </p>

<p>Note: <strong>successful applicants will have two or more of these considerations clearly shown</strong>. Nobody will be able to get all of them.</p>

<p>What all of this amalgamates to is that it works to the applicant's favour to submit as many bank statements as possible so that the decision-maker will be able to detect clear cash flow patterns.</p>

<h1>What Do My Bank Statements Say About Me?</h1>

<h2>The Ideal Case</h2>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5TWPq.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5TWPq.jpg"" alt=""The ideal bank statement case""></a></p>

<p>This applicant is gainfully employed and has ongoing expenditures that indicate close ties to the local economy. The applicant has been saving money for their visit. This is an ideal case and the applicant has great chances for success.</p>

<h2>Funds Parking</h2>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/f5rVT.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/f5rVT.jpg"" alt=""Funds parking example 1""></a></p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZAU82.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZAU82.jpg"" alt=""Funds parking example 2""></a></p>

<p>These statements show an irregular cash flow which has shifted the existing balances upward.  It is impossible to detect any ongoing commitments that show a strong connection to the local economy. These applicants can expect problems <em>despite</em> having impressive balances on the most recent statement(s).  The refusal notice will say something like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>...I am not satisfied that these funds are actually available to you...</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>or more worryingly:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>...I am not satisfied that you have accurately presented your circumstances and therefore your intentions in applying to enter the United Kingdom...</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>To repeat: <strong>it's not just about the ending balance</strong>. They are also looking for the history of flows in and out of the account.</p>

<h2>Opacity</h2>

<p>""<em>...of course I included a bank statement! But they ignored it and refused me...</em>""</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4pGx9.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4pGx9.jpg"" alt=""A single statement""></a></p>

<p>People who fear that their history make reveal a weakness will sometimes resort to an 'opacity strategy', where they submit a single statement or several statements from a broken series, or simply too few statements. This strategy is both naive and disastrous because the decision-maker cannot get a clear understanding of the the applicant's circumstances and will suspect the applicant is hiding something.  The inevitable refusal notice will closely track those for 'Funds Parking' but with an increased element of suspicion added. As a general rule of thumb, it is better to provide a <em>complete picture</em> than to leave the decision-maker with the impression that you are trying to hide something.  Bona fide visitors to the UK will be transparent about their circumstances when there is a need to be so.</p>

<h2>Insufficient Capacity</h2>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uuGak.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uuGak.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>This series shows that the applicant is gainfully employed and has ongoing commitments, but the balance is dipping into the negative every month. The applicant is having difficulty meeting their day-to-day cash requirements and wanting to visit the UK with these circumstances is out-of-whack with their lifestyle; this is to say that the applicant's intentions are suspect. The applicant is not in stable circumstances and they can expect significant obstacles <em>even with a sponsor</em>. </p>

<p>The refusal notice will say something like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>...I am not satisfied that you meet the immigration rules on this occasion...</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If a cosponsor is offering to provide support, the refusal notice might make a comment like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>...I acknowledge your sponsor proposes to pay for your visit, however, it is the circumstances of the applicant that remain paramount when assessing your application...</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>or worse:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>...however whilst I take that into account in assessing your proposed maintenance and accommodation in the UK, that is only one aspect of the visitor rules and this sponsorship does not satisfy me of your own intention to leave the UK on completion of your visit...</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Erratic/unstable Lifestyle</h2>

<p>""<em>They totally ignored the £4,000 in my bank account and refused me!</em>""</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZLjlA.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZLjlA.jpg"" alt=""Erratic lifestyle example 1""></a></p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CBio1.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CBio1.jpg"" alt=""Erratic lifestyle example 2""></a></p>

<p>Both of these exhibits show that the applicant's most recent balance is positive, but regardless of the final balance, they are likely to face serious problems.  Both exhibits show wild and unpredictable swings in the balance and little to indicate a stable connection to the local economy.</p>

<p>Using these patterns it is reasonable to expect a refusal notice that says something like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>...It is your responsibility to demonstrate that if granted entry clearance, you will comply with the terms of your visa and have the intention to leave. I consider you have failed to demonstrate economic ties to (country name goes here)...</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>or:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>...I am not satisfied that you will maintain and accommodate yourself and any dependant adequately out of the resources available to you without recourse to public funds or taking employment...</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Other FAQs</h1>

<p>Some specific cases are below...</p>

<h2>Proportionality</h2>

<p>A frequent source of refusals comes under ""proportionality"". This is a strategy where the applicant intends to deplete his life savings on a visit. ""Proportionality"" also covers the case where an applicant intends to spent more than about two or three months earnings on a visit, sometimes up to six months. This strategy is <strong>doomed from the outset</strong> because ECO's believe that genuine visitors do not deplete their financial reserves on a visit and moreover, ECO's believe that genuine visitors do not spend a multiple of their monthly cash intake.  There is no hard rule covering proportionality and UKVI does not provide guidance on what is acceptable, so as a general rule of thumb if you plan on spending more than a month or two of your cash intake, you can expect problems and the solution is <strong>don't apply</strong>. Wait until your personal circumstances are more prosperous.</p>

<h2>Dependent Spouses and Children Under 18</h2>

<p><a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-visas-and-immigration"" rel=""noreferrer"">UKVI</a> recognizes that spouses and dependent children will not be able to present bank statements. In these cases the primary applicant's bank statements will be used to assess the family's circumstances as a whole.  The UK approves thousands of family applications each year.</p>

<p>Children over 18 who cannot show a reason for maintaining a dependant's  lifestyle will face increased difficulty.  This is especially true if they are not travelling as a family unit.  The same can generally be said for students, although students can usually provide other evidence that demonstrates local ties.</p>

<h2>How much do I need in order to apply?</h2>

<p>The rules do not specify an amount, they are intentionally vague so as to give the decision-maker latitude in assessing individual circumstances. A rule of thumb, however, uses the applicant's stated purpose and intended activities as a rough guideline, and the applicant should be able to clear this amount without undue hard hardship.</p>

<p>If you are concerned about isolating and providing a specific figure, there's a good chance you have not understood this article in its entirety and you may want to read it again. <strong>It's not just about the final balance.</strong></p>

<h2>Can I use a co-sponsor?</h2>

<p>Yes, of course.  But lots of applications fail because the decision-maker cannot understand why the sponsor is undertaking that burden. This is especially true for internet relationships where the couple has not previously met in person.  It is also true for family members where the relationship is too remote or too distant to be plausible.</p>

<p>The sponsor needs to provide a series of their own bank statements to demonstrate their own capacity and credibility.</p>

<h3>""<em>...My father/brother/uncle/aunt was my co-sponsor and can comfortably afford my maintenance and accommodation, but I was <strong>still</strong> refused...</em>"".</h3>

<p>Sponsored applications are weak to begin with and they do not relieve the applicant of demonstrating ties to the local economy and social landscape.  While the money may be there, it is much more difficult for the applicant to make a strong case that they will not overstay or abuse their visa in some other way. Generally, sponsorship should be used only as a last resort and only if the applicant can provide a compellingly strong case.</p>

<h2>Can I use prepaid credit cards?</h2>

<p>This may work with Schengen applications, but not for UK applications. Credit cards add a layer of obscurity to the funding source and tend to shroud all of the lifestyle and transparency listed above.  </p>

<h2>I don't have enough bank statements</h2>

<p>An applicant needs to demonstrate that they will maintain themselves adequately without recourse to public funds.  Genuine visitors are usually  able to accomplish this. If you are unable to do this in a convincing way, consider putting off your visit until a more prosperous time.</p>

<h2>Can I purchase a set of bank statements?</h2>

<p>There are services in some countries (Nigeria, India, Pakistan, to name a few) who will do this for you. If you know about them, the decision-maker knows about them also. Remember that consular staff have built up relationships with the reputable banks over a long period of time (we're talking <em>decades</em> here) and are able to make discreet enquiries about the validity of a given set of statements.</p>

<h2>I live with my parents and do not have a bank account</h2>

<p>See above. You can expect problems demonstrating that you are a genuine applicant. Consider waiting until your parents submit a family application.</p>

<h2>I am self-employed and do not maintain a bank account</h2>

<p>You can expect problems. Genuine visitors to the UK fit a profile that is not entirely cash based.  Moreover, you will find it almost impossible to establish that your cash has been lawfully obtained. Consider opening and using a proper bank account for 12 - 18 months prior to submitting your application.</p>

<h2>What else can be provided to show strong ties?</h2>

<p>There is no other form of evidence taken as an absolute substitution. Property deeds are rarely helpful because property ownership normally persists when the owner is living elsewhere. Personal attestations from family and friends are not helpful because there is a bulk of performance history indicating otherwise. But there are a few exceptions, for example, you can get an attestation from your country's equivalent of the UK's Foreign Office that puts forward your circumstances. As another example, holding public office may work depending upon other circumstances.  Otherwise, please see the section ""<em>Other questions about bank statements</em>"", below.</p>

<h2>I am desperate...</h2>

<p><em>...to visit the UK, I really need to go and I promise I will not overstay. The problem is that I have no real bank accounts or anything else that shows a connection to my country. You see, my situation is different. It's like blah blah blah, and then yada yada yada... Please help!</em></p>

<p>There is no magic bullet, they like to approve applicants who clearly and unambiguously fall into a low-risk profile. For more information, see below.</p>

<h2>I cannot provide a compelling case</h2>

<p><strong>Don't apply.</strong>  Getting a refusal can complicate future applications even when you are in more prosperous circumstances and could easily qualify.  </p>

<h2>Marhaba lounge</h2>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.marhabaservices.com/source/lounge.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Marhaba lounge</a> in T3 Concourse A (between gates A2/A3) has rather nice showers, easily on a par with a four-star hotel.  A shower alone without lounge access costs Dhs 55 (~US$15), including towel and cosmetics kit (shampoo, body soap, toothbrush, shaving kit, etc).  Just beware that in the muggy Dubai summer, even ""cold"" water is lukewarm, and ventilation is kind of minimal so it gets pretty sauna-like pretty fast if you shower too long.  Opening the cubicle door provides rapid relief though. There might be a queue (even longer than the free shower). Overall score, <strong>8/10</strong>.</p>

"Can you travel to the US 6 months before your tourist visa expires?","67627","","<p>I've heard that you can't travel to the US 6 months before your visa expires.  Is that true?  Or does that only apply to 6 months until the expiration of the passport?  (Or does it apply to neither?)</p>
","<p>I haven't heard or come across a rule which requires you have six months or more validity on a US visa to be allowed in. <a href=""http://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/info/info_1298.html"">As the US Department of State website explains</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The visa validity is the length of time you are permitted to travel <strong>to</strong>
  a port-of-entry in the U.S.</p>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p>Additionally, <strong>the visa expiration date
  shown on your visa does not reflect how long you are authorized to
  stay within the U.S</strong>. Entry and the length of authorized stay within
  the U.S. are determined by the Customs and Border Protection (CBP)
  Officer at the port-of-entry each time you travel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What I believe you are talking about is the minimum validity of your passport that is required. <a href=""http://london.usembassy.gov/faq-passports.html#niv200"">From the London office website of US Embassy</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I understand that my passport needs to be valid for at least six
  months; is this correct?</em></p>
  
  <p>The requirement that a passport is valid for travel for six months beyond the holder's stay in the United States is waived for certain nationalities.  <a href=""http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/104770.pdf"">Please follow this link for further
  information</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which means that if your country is listed among the ones in the PDF document, having less than six months validity of your <em>passport</em> will not be an issue. Additionally, <a href=""http://www.visitusa.org.uk/visitors/us_visa_and_entry_requirements.aspx"">other websites mention a minimum of 90 days validity is required for your passport</a> (although this might be specific to if you're entering under the visa waiver programme) but <a href=""http://london.usembassy.gov/faq-passports.html#niv078"">the London office of US Embassy site states that is okay</a>, and will only limit your stay period to whatever date your passport expires.</p>

<p>However, <a href=""http://newdelhi.usembassy.gov/nonimmigrant_visas/frequently-asked-questions.html"">the New Delhi website of US Embassy</a> implies you do need to get your passport renewed if it will be valid for less than six months from the time you enter.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Please obtain a new passport before your interview if:</p>
  
  <p>Your passport is going to expire in less than 6 months after the
  time you enter the United States.</p>

<p>Your situation, then, will vary depending on what residency status you hold in a country as well as your citizenship.</p>

"How safe is it to fly with Ryanair?","66155","","<p>We all know how great it feels when we find a cheap flight via Ryanair, but are you actually getting what you paid for? </p>

<p>Recently I've heard stories about Ryanair's reputation when it comes to safety procedures. I heard that most of the time they <em>ignore</em> the safety procedures required by law to operate a flight. Since they're a budget airline, they keep turnarounds under 25 minutes, and there have been reports that this is putting passengers in danger.</p>

<p>Mostly I'm referring to the statements made in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zi-x_UgTTOQ"">the terrifyingly scary documentary shown on Channel 4</a> about two undercover reporters who show safety and health procedures being ignored, and exhausted cabin crew complaining about the number of hours they are forced to work, and negative experiences they had with the airline.</p>

<p>Another scary moment in the video, is when the instructor tells the <em>class</em> that passengers seating in <em>1A</em>, will most definitely die if there is any sort of incident where the aircraft collides, as there is some <em>metal rod</em> that can shoot through the passenger's skull. </p>

<p>Also see <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/travel/blog/2007/feb/07/willryanairsthreattosackp"">a Guardian article</a>.</p>

<p>How safe is it to actually travel with this airline, how are such practices not enforced by the law, and routinely checked?</p>
","<p>The number of fatalities caused by a certain airline does NOT reflect how safe that airline is. The number of fatalities can be very high due to a single accident which is caused by reasons not related to the safety of the airline in question. </p>

<p>Usually people tend to think of safety only when it comes to airplanes, this is wrong. The safety of an airline is much more than that, it is embedded in every single thing, it is more of a culture than just a bunch of policies and procedures. </p>

<p>In general, I would rather fly in a twenty-year-old Ryanair airplane than in a one-year-old plane in an African airline. Why is that? EU civil authorities have very strict policies and procedures, lately they've even started forcing the new safety principle called SMS (Safety Management System) which simply involves all parts of the airlines in the safety, including the higher management since the first principle of this system is to put the liability and responsibility on the higher management instead of just blaming some employee when something happens under (human error). </p>

<p>Also, the random checks conducted by the EU authorities are a pain in the ass to all airlines, they are brutal and serious. They will have no problem issuing all kinds of punishments if they have a finding, including suspending the airline. I personally deal with this stuff in my job and I know how good they are. </p>

<p>Talking of crew duty hours, just to let you know, as a crew member for long time I met a lot of crew members from all over the world, we all have the same complaint (duty hours). It is a universal thing for crew members to complain about. That's due to the anti-routine schedules where crew members have to work weekends and holidays and nights etc. But AFAIK, in EU crew members can not exceed 100 credit hours per month, and that's even less than in the US or the middle east where crew members can fly up to 120 credit hours. </p>

<p>One more thing, crew members who fly for domestic or regional airlines, such as Ryanair, tend to complain more about working hours because they need more flights to reach the 100 credit hours, unlike flying for international airlines, where you can make the same amount of credit hours in 4 or 5 long-haul flights. When I first joined I needed like forty domestic legs to reach 70 hours, but once I had enough seniority I could make the same by flying <strong>three</strong> flights to the US only! </p>

<p>Bottom line, EU civil authorities are the best when it comes to the safety of different airlines, either the EU ones or the foreign ones that fly to the EU. So, having permission to operate in the EU is enough proof that the airline is safe enough. This is my opinion as a safety person. </p>

","<p>Yes, and <a href=""http://learn.condomdepot.com/2014/03/14/travel-condoms-preparing-for-international-visits/"">there are great articles online detailing travelling with condoms</a>.  They're not liquids, flammable or on any of the TSA unapproved lists, so you're totally fine to take them.  However, remember they're meant to be stored at room temperature as they are still medical devices you don't want to take risks with damaging them. Don't store them with sharp items in your carry-on (even pens etc).  If your laptop or phone gets really warm, it's best not to have them side-by-side either.</p>

<p>I know that normally banks don't exchange foreign currencies in coins, but is there a way so that I can still get some money for my foreign coins?</p>
","<p>Unless it is a significant amount, changing coins isn't worth it. The amounts are small and most banks and foreign exchanges won't accept coins generally.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AIl7W.jpg"" alt=""unicef change for good logo""></p>

<p>My solution is to collect the left over foreign coins until I fly on an airline that participates in the <a href=""http://www.unicef.org/corporate_partners/index_25030.html"">Change for Good</a> program and then donate them. British Airways and Virgin also have their own programs. It is a great concept as a small amount of foreign coins isn't very valuable to you, but when compounded across thousands of passengers a year, it can make a real difference.</p>

<p>If you don't want to wait until your next flight to donate, many charity shops (at least in the UK) accept foreign coins.</p>

"Does the 90 days VWP rule expire if you travel from the US to Canada?","65924","","<p>I'm on a New Zealand passport.</p>

<p>From most US Embassy webpages:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) enables nationals of certain countries,
  including Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K., to travel to the
  United States for tourism or business for stays of 90 days or less
  without obtaining a visa, if certain requirements are met. <strong>Under the
  VWP, time spent in Canada, Mexico, and adjacent islands counts towards
  the maximum of 90 days stay allowed under the program.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'll be there on a 1-year working holiday visa starting when I arrive in Vancouver. I'm spending 3 days in Hawaii en route to Vancouver. This seems to imply that 90 days after landing in Hawaii, my time will be up and I won't be able to get back into the US, as my living in Canada will not reset the clock. What if after this time I want to say, pop across the border to Seattle? How can I restart the 90 days, without having to resort to say, flying to Japan and back just to reset it?</p>
","<p>There's an important distinction between leaving the US temporarily, and leaving permanently, which is as much as anything dictated by you returning to your place of residence.</p>

<p>If you are in the US under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) and you leave the US for a few weeks to visit Canada (or Mexico) with an intent to return to the US then you are deemed to have only temporarily left the US for that period, and thus your 90 days carries through - even though you're out of the country.  In the days of the I-94W forms (the green form you used to fill in when arriving in the US), you would actually keep your I-94W in your passport even when you left the US.</p>

<p>If you are leaving US to return to your place of residence, then you are leaving permanently. In this case your VWP period would end when you left the country, and historically that's when you would have turned in your I-94W.</p>

<p>As you have a work visa to be in Canada, for the period of that visa Canada would be your place of residence. That means that every time you leave the US your visit will have deemed to have ended as you've returned to your place of residence, and thus permanently left the US - which means that when you re-enter the US the VWP clock will be restarted.</p>

<p>At the end of the day the Canada/Mexico condition is intended to stop people doing visa runs from the US to Canada/Mexico, thus getting another 90 days on their VWP.  If it's clear that's not what you're doing then you'll have no issues.</p>

<p>Don't forget that to enter the US under the VWP you will first need to <a href=""https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/"">obtain an ESTA</a>.</p>

<p>(Note: Usual provisions apply. IANAL, but I've entered the US around 40 times both on VWP and on Visas so I know the processes fairly well! If you want a definite answer, either contact <a href=""http://www.uscis.gov"">USCIS</a>, or talk to a qualified immigration lawyer)</p>

","<p>That depends. If you booked the flights together at the same time, luggage will usually be ""checked through"" to your final destination. If you booked them separately, especially if it's different airlines, you'll probably have to <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/2173/can-i-through-check-my-bags-on-separate-bookings?rq=1"">pick up your luggage and check it in again</a>.</p>

"What exactly does ""nights"" means when you book? Is it number of night you are going to sleep, or simply days you are going to stay?","65469","","<p>For example, suppose that I'm going to travel London and will arrive at 10am, 1st December. And will stay a week, means will leave 10am, 8th December. Technically it's 7 nights, but also 8 days. Should I book 7 counts(nights) or 8 counts?</p>
","<h2>Counting Nights</h2>

<p><strong>Accommodation bookings count the nights you spend</strong> simply because that's what you need accommodation for: to sleep. This is based on the somewhat valid assumption that your main night time activity is sleeping. </p>

<p>I understand where the confusion might arise from between day and night counts. Because nights are interposed between days you think you are staying for 1 day more. However consider that usually check-in time is in the afternoon and check-out is in the morning so effectively you are occupying the accommodation for the exact numbers of hours  (computed as <code>nights * 24h</code>) you booked it for. To this purpose consider a realistic 3 night booking with check-in at 3pm and checkout at 11am. Total booking time is <code>2 * 24 + 20 = 68h</code> which is <code>~ 3 days</code>.</p>

<h2>Your 7-Night Reservation</h2>

<p>You say you plan on arriving on the 1st December and leaving on the 8th of December. That equates to a booking of 7 nights. Since you mention an arrival time of 10am, the actual check-in time depends on the hotel/hostel. Most of these usually check guests in in the afternoon, to leave time between check-outs to clean the rooms. Check-out times tend to be before noon, for the same exact reason. To be sure, ask the hotel for specific check-in and check-out times.</p>

<p>However, if you arrive before your room is ready you can most definitely ask for them to keep your luggage whilst you go to the nearest pub for a good old English breakfast. This should be a free service.</p>

<p>As mentioned in the comments below, if you desperately need the room for 10am because you want to shower/sleep then you might have to book for an extra night (the one between the 30th November and 1st December). If you do so make sure you tell the hotel you will be arriving on the 1st rather than on the 30th, to ensure they don't consider it a no-show and cancel your booking (most probably after charging you for the whole amount nonetheless).</p>

"How early can you go through airport security for an International flight?","65352","","<p>I'm not sure if this is airline or airport-specific? (assuming airport)</p>

<p>I know that if I have an early morning flight and show up the night before, I'm denied because the date on my ticket is for the next day. However, I just took a flight from Lima to Easter Island that left at 1:20 AM, and while I was denied through security at 11AM <em>(yeah, I tried, I was already at the airport)</em> I was allowed to enter around 4 PM, just over 8 hours prior to the flight. <em>(Security was fine, but Immigration balked at my earliness, and eventually let me through when they got tired of waiting from an answer from above.)</em></p>

<p>I've had 12 hour layovers like this before, but only on international connections through an airport.</p>

<p>I'm interested in the general answer to the question, but I do have a localized situation that has prompted it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have an upcoming 9:45AM flight (international) into <strong>Santiago, Chile</strong>, and my
  connection (domestic) will get me to the airport around 9PM the night
  before. I'd prefer to stay at the airport and sleep, but it would be
  much nicer airside, especially if I get into a lounge. Do I have a
  chance of waiting until 1AM or so (so the date matches my boarding
  pass) and being allowed through security?</p>
</blockquote>
","<p>The specific rules depend on the airport and country. Usually the check-in starts 3 hours before the departure. So if you travel with luggage to check-in, the answer to your question is <em>3 hours in advance</em>. If you don't have luggage to check-in, you can go through security 3 hours in advance and sometimes more than 3 hours in advance . That being said, keep in mind that security and immigration is closed during the night in some airports. So if your flight is at 6am and security opens at 4:30am, you can go through security at 4:30am or later.</p>

<p>In most US airports the rule is </p>

<ul>
<li>if you depart after 4:30am, you can go through security any time after 4:30am on the date of departure,</li>
<li><p>if your flight departs between 12:00am (midnight) and 1:30am, you can go through security on the previous date (after 4:30 am) or on the date of departure (before 1:30am).</p></li>
<li><p>In order to <em>check in</em> for some international flights, you need your documents to be checked by an airline agent (that depends on the destination, the airline, and your citizenship). Then you can go through security only 3 hours before the flight.</p></li>

<p>What is the situation in Canada? Does a person who would need a visa to <strong>enter</strong> Canada need a visa to connect <strong>through</strong> Canada without exiting the airport?</p>
","<p>The answer depends entirely on the nationality of the traveler, which country they are traveling to, and which specific airport they are traveling through in Canada - but in general most flights through Canada airports do require you to pass through Canadian Immigration, and thus if you require a Visa to enter Canada, you will need one to transit too. </p>

","<p><strong>No you can't turn up late to check-in on a delayed flight</strong>, unless the check-in closing time is delayed along with the departure time. Note that usually this is not the case.</p>

<p>The check-in closing time is set relative to the scheduled departure, and usually remains the same, regardless of whether the flight is delayed or not. Hence if you show up at the airport late for check-in, even though you still have plenty of time before boarding due to the flight being delayed, you will be considered as a no-show.

<p>Apparently the bidet is a necessity of daily life in some countries and we have already had questions such as<br>
<a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/q/17641/32134"">OK we are all adults here, so really, how on earth should I live without bidet?</a><br>
but to my surprise nobody has ever questioned as to how to use them. </p>

<p>Assuming I'd be travelling to e.g. Italy and encounter such a bidet in my hotel bathroom, </p>

<ul>
<li>What should I use it for?</li>
<li>What should I not use it for?</li>
<li>How should I use it?</li>
<li>How should I not use it?</li>
<li><strong>Bonus question: What is the social aspect of bidet usage in countries where they are widespread?</strong> Is it implicitly assumed everybody uses this device on a weekly/daily/hourly basis? Should I dare not talk about it or is there no taboo around it? E.g. when I say ""I just used the bidet."" does that sound like ""I just washed my hands"" or is that akin to ""I just took a dump"", i.e. a rather awkward thing to mention as small talk?</li>
</ul>

","<h2>Bidet Who Are You?</h2>

<p>The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidet"" rel=""noreferrer"">bidet</a> is a sanitary installation which looks like a shallow toilet bowl with water taps. The purpose of the bidet is to clean up after you've done what you came to do in the toilet. The rationale here is that sometimes toilet paper isn't enough and you can't always shower after you went to the toilet. Enters: the bidet. I feel like I have to mention this: <strong>the bidet is not a toilet</strong>. You go to the toilet <em>first</em> and then you use a bidet.</p>

<h2>How Do You Work?</h2>

<p>The way a bidet works is fairly intuitive: you get tempered water and a piece of soap and you clean yourself. Like a targeted shower, if you will. </p>

<h3>Step 1: Sit</h3>

<p>There are two ways you can sit on a bidet:</p>

<ul>
<li>Facing towards the water taps</li>
<li>With the water taps behind your back</li>
</ul>

<p>The way you sit depends on what you want to clean up, and also on the way you feel more comfortable. Below is a picture of a person straddling a bidet facing towards the taps:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KVLqS.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KVLqS.jpg"" alt=""Bidet straddling""></a>
<sup>Image courtesy of <a href=""http://www.wikihow.com/Use-a-Bidet"" rel=""noreferrer"">WikiHow</a>, CC-by-SA</sup></p>

<p>You might need to remove your trousers to sit in this way.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Wash</h3>

<p>Having found your seating comfort you are now ready to turn on the water. You'll want to do this slowly so as to control the jet strength and the temperature. Once you are satisfied with both you start washing yourself using whichever cleaning product you require.</p>

<p>When washing yourself you can either fill the bowl and splash water on your body or use the water stream directly. This will depend on personal preference. Some bidets have nozzles you can use to direct the water flow (top left). Others don't and sometimes provide holes from which flows a weak water jet (top right). Some have a vertical spray nozzle (bottom left) which is commonly used to clean the anal region. A more technological bidets can be integrated in the toilet bowl in the form of a water nozzle (bottom right). Below are pictures of these types of bidets:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/d6S8Rm.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/d6S8Rm.jpg"" alt=""Bidet nozzle""></a>

<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UAd2Dm.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UAd2Dm.jpg"" alt=""Bidet integrated toilet bowl nozzle""></a></p>

<p>To avoid any surprises turn on the water slowly and cover the jet with your hand so as to get a warning before the water hits you.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Dry</h3>

<p>When you are done washing you can either use a towel or toilet paper to dry yourself. </p>

<h2>What Else Can You Do?</h2>

<p>For completeness sake, note that you can also use bidets to soak and clean your feet. To do this you lower the toilet seat lid, sit on that, and put your feet in the bidet, provided the two are installed close together.</p>

"What does this sticker on the back of my passport mean?","62544","","<p>I am currently travelling in the USA and when checking in on the boarding flight to enter the country, the security personnel attached a small yellow-white sticker to my passport (see a somewhat terrible photo below):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zin8X.jpg"" width=""400""></p>

<p>This happened on Stockholm Arlanda (ARN) when I was waiting in queue for check in, and by one of the security personnel that inquired about my business in USA.</p>

<p>Does this have any special meaning? Why would they do it anyway? Can I take it away before I leave the country, or should it stay on?</p>
","<p>I can give an answer to this because this happens to me very regularly, for a good reason.</p>

<p>Typically for holders of US / UK / European / Australian / NZ passports, a wide range of countries do not require a visa in advance, or often issue them on arrival. If you're travelling within North America or Europe where these visa rules are well-known, an airline simply checks you in.</p>

<p>The security clearance sticker is used whenever the airline has a liability to carry you back to your origin in case you're denied entry. Many countries require you to pass through passport control both when leaving and entering the country. In UK and Europe however, passport control is done at many airports only when you <em>enter</em> the country, not when you leave.</p>

<p>I hold an Indian passport, which means that for most destinations I need to get a visa. If I ever end up in a situation where I go to a country and I'm denied entry, the airline is obligated to fly me back. For this reason, airlines run their visa checks for passport holders whom they <em>know</em> need a visa, and upon validation, they paste this sticker. Don't take this sticker off until you reach your destination because in case of any queries - for instance, staff at the boarding gate may want to confirm your visa status - airline staff check for this sticker to see whether you've been cleared for boarding.</p>

<p>ICTS International (that's the corporate name; at airports, I've seen employees wearing badges that read 'i-Sec') is one of those companies that a lot of airlines hire out this task to; another company that airlines outsource this task to is CheckPoint. Some airlines carry out their own checks and use the same sticker system too. </p>

","<p>It's common in Europe for many cars to have a Diesel or Gasoline version. </p>

<li>The rental car agent will tell you</li>
<li>Next to the gas tank a warning about the type of petrol.</li>

"Will my checked luggage freeze in the airplane?","61929","","<p>I'm taking some freeze-sensitive items in a checked luggage for a short flight. It's <strong>cheese, chocolate, toothpaste and wine</strong>. I would like to know whether the luggage can get ""frozen"" in the aircraft. Sometimes it happened to me that my stuff actually was quite cold after the flight, so I'd like to be quite sure. Especially the cheese was really expensive and freezing it would very likely demage it.</p>

<p>Usually I pack everything well in clothes, but this time the things are just too many so it's tough to do more than just protect the wine from breaking.</p>

<p>Some details: It's an A320 flight taking 1.5 hours, with Czech Airlines, from Paris CDG to Prague PRG.</p>
","<p>On an aircraft like one you're on, it's interesting to realise that the cargo hold is actually pressurised, just like the cabin.  (The floor between the two is not a pressure bulkhead, so needs to be roughly the same or it could collapse from the pressure.</p>

<p>However, as you've observed, the temperature is often cold as while the cabin is warmed, the cargo hold usually is not.</p>

<p>From a similar plane (767) and <a href=""http://enroute.aircanada.com/en/articles/what-temperature-is-it-in-the-baggage-hold"">written by a A320 pilot</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Conditioned air is directed from the cabin, so the air tends to be a
  little cooler by the time it reaches the cargo areas, which are also
  less insulated than the cabin. Cargo temperatures vary in our fleet.
  <strong>The Boeing 767 maintains its baggage hold above 7˚C</strong>, but the bulk area
  (where animals are carried) can be heated above 18˚C. Controlled
  temperature cargo bins are also available when temperature-sensitive
  goods are being shipped.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So your wine is unlikely to freeze if it only gets down to 7 degrees, but it's worth noting that in some exceptional cases (close to the outside, no insulation, extreme temperatures outside) it may cause some freezing.  Your best bet is to insulate it with some jackets or similar, like you've suggested you will do.  Odds are, it'll be fine.</p>

"Why do public toilets in the US have large gaps (no privacy)?","61314","","<p>Most public toilets in the US are very low in privacy, the bottom gap in the door is so big (around 15-20% of the door), the side gaps are too big as well. This will make the toilet experience so unpleasant with no privacy at all. You can literally count the people outside and people outside are like ""ok, now he is wiping, etc."".</p>

<p><strong>I can't think of a reason behind this. Can someone tell me why?</strong></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZPSDo.jpg"" alt=""US Toilets""></p>
","<p>I can't find a definitive link but there are a few reasons, a lot of which were already covered in the comments.  </p>

<p>One, the style in your picture makes the whole place easier to clean. You can hose down the floors in one go and there are not so many joins between the walls and the floors for gunk to build up. (<strong>EDIT</strong>: in your picture you can see that the toilets don't even join the floor -- so for that setup I'm pretty sure it's for ease of cleaning). </p>

<p>Two, it's so that people can see what you're doing in there. It discourages drug taking or people having sex in the cubicles because it's obvious what's going on. Also if someone passes out on the toilet (for whatever reason) it's easier for people to notice -- in a fully obscured stall someone could lie in there for a long time. It may also just discourage people for sitting in there for longer than necessary. </p>

<p>Lastly, it's cheaper and easier. Divisions like that can be deployed in any room regardless of the flatness of the floor, or the height of the room, etc. Building divisions that actually fit floor to ceiling might require custom cutting and fitting, that might happen in a big building with dozens of identical toilets but for the odd public toilet cheap and easy is the way people will go. </p>

<p>To add to <strong>choster</strong>'s comment, it does tend to vary widely across the US. I've seen toilets with even less privacy than that picture -- like a door that's you can see over when you stand up. The concerns about misusing the toilets tend to trump the privacy, particularly in public places. But you're right, in many private places they will be more sealed. And there're many places in the world where you'll be lucky to find a door at all -- or many people that care that there's no door there. </p>

<p><strong>I am wondering if I could bring a zip lock bag of whey protein powder with me as part of my carry on and if anyone has had any similar experiences regarding this situation.</strong></p>
","<p><strong>Yes</strong>, you are fine bringing a bag of protein powder in your carry-on.

"What is an open ticket?","60876","","<p>When speaking of an airline ticket, I have heard the term <em>open ticket</em> which has to do with dates not being fixed I believe.</p>

<ul>
<li>What exactly is an open ticket?</li>
<li>How do you get an actual flight from one?</li>
<li>What are typical restrictions?</li>
</ul>
","<p><em>Open ticket</em> means that <strong>the return date</strong> is not fixed. The date of the first flight is set (although typically this can be changed for a fee). Assuming that it is an unrestricted ticket that means that you can get a return flight on any date usually up to a year after your outbound flight.</p>

<p>You will need to call the airline to book a specific date once you know when you want to use the ticket. This will, of course, be subject to availability. You can not use it for a flight that is already fully booked. Assuming the flight isn't full, you could do this at the airport at the last minute.</p>

<p>To buy an open ticket you will usually have to go through the airline or a travel agent (i.e. not a website).</p>

<p>Restrictions vary with price. All open tickets must be used within a specific timeframe (at best 1 year). They are often only available for business class etc. Some have a fixed return date that can be changed for a nominal (or not so nominal) fee (useful if you have a 'I wont be longer than this' date but would like the option to return earlier). Ask before you purchase the ticket.</p>

<p>I should add that as these tickets are mostly used by business travelers, they are priced accordingly. They are rarely cheap.</p>

Do they have different cancellation or change policies, for example?</p>

<p>I'm looking at a situation where Economy MileSAAver tickets are unavailable for a date, but both AAnytime Economy and MileSAAver business/first tickets are available for the same number of miles. Are there any reasons why potentially I shouldn't book the latter?</p>

<p>Is the situation changed if I am American Airlines Exec Platinum?</p>
","<p>If you are choosing between a business or first MileSAAver or an economy AAnytime, the <em>only</em> reason to choose AAnytime is to maximize your flexibility in changing flights. An AAnytime award can be changed essentially any time until the day of departure with no penalty, provided there is a seat available, whereas to change a MileSAAver flight, there would need to be MileSAAver availability on the new flight <em>and</em> you would be assessed a $150 change fee.</p>

<p>The incidental costs and benefits at the airport would be roughly the same. But flying in the premium cabin means a better in-flight experience, and on intercontinental routes you would also be comped access to the Admirals Club.</p>

<hr>

<p>AAnytime awards are generally treated as full-fare (Y) tickets. An AAnytime economy ticket, for example, will include <a href=""https://www.aa.com/i18n/utility/baggageExceptions.jsp"">two free checked bags</a> and a Priority AAccess boarding pass. You can also request seats in the Main Cabin Extra seats or Preferred Seats for no charge. There are no fees for any changes to your flight, although there is a fee for redeposit (unless they are from an account with AAdvantage Executive Platinum status).</p>

<p>They differ in that award tickets of any kind cannot be endorsed, do not earn miles or Q-miles, and cannot be upgraded.</p>

<p>MileSAAver awards have all the above restrictions and lack all the benefits, and are subject to tight capacity controls to boot. They do incur a change fee if you alter your routing (again, unless the miles come from an Executive Platinum account), though not if you keep the same routing and merely change your travel dates. A MileSAAver economy ticket is like a discount economy ticket; it does not get the baggage and priority boarding benefits.</p>

<p>But as you have found, a MileSAAver business or domestic first ticket costs the same number of AAdvantage miles as an AAnytime economy ticket. Flying in a premium cabin also gets you a baggage allowance and Priority AAccess, a priority checkin line at the airport, plus an invitation to the airport club if you are on an intercontinental flight, not to mention a seat that is going to be at least as comfortable as any Preferred Seat in economy. Given my travel patterns, I will always opt for a restricted premium cabin ticket over an unrestricted main cabin ticket when they cost the same.</p>

<p>Thus, the cargo box on the roof increased fuel consumption by about 5% compared to the baseline.</p>

<p>(The full test also measured the noise level at the driver's ear, and compared the ease of installation and various other aspects of the different options, but I'll leave those out of this summary.

"Do I have to go through customs, recheck my bag, etc. during my Heathrow layover?","57151","","<p>I am flying from New York to Nairobi, Kenya, with a layover at Heathrow.</p>

<p>Both flights are on the same itinerary with British Airways (i.e. it was booked as a flight from New York to Nairobi).  They are both in terminal 5 at Heathrow.  I'm a US citizen, if that's relevant.</p>

<p>What exactly will I have to do during my layover in the UK?  Specifically, will I have to:</p>

<ul>
<li>go through customs?  immigration?</li>
<li>claim checked bags and recheck them?</li>
<li>go through security again?</li>
<li>anything else?  for example, I have heard something about having to go to a ""flight connections"" counter after I land in London and I'm not allowed to get on the 2nd flight without checking in here</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm seeing a lot of conflicting information, and am trying to decide if I should pay $84 to pre-select seats at the front of the cabin to get out of the plane quicker/get to the front of any lines.  I have a 2 hour layover in Heathrow.</p>
","<p>British Airways provide a <a href=""http://www.britishairways.com/en-gb/information/airport-information/london-heathrow-t5"" rel=""noreferrer"">lot of information on T5 on their website</a>, including all about Flight Connections. I'd very much suggest you read through that.</p>

<p>To tackle the main bits, assuming you have a single ticket covering both legs of your journey:</p>

<ul>
<li>You will not pass through UK customs</li>
<li>You will not pass through UK immigration</li>
<li>Your bags will be checked through to your final BA destination, so won't have to be collected or re-checked. (Check the baggage tags given to you at checkin to ensure they have been tagged all the way through)</li>
<li>If your starting airport is able, they'll give you your second boarding pass</li>
<li>If not, you'll have to go to the flight connections desk to collect it</li>
<li>On arrival, you'll follow the purple Flight Connections signs, and have your boarding pass + passport checked</li>
<li>You will have to clear security, which is upstairs from flight connections, before you enter the main departures area of the terminal</li>
</ul>

<p>As long as there are no flight delays on your inbound, 2 hours will be fine. Queues to get your boarding pass checked before security tend not to be too bad, and while security can be shocking at times, we're talking 30-45 minutes at bad times.</p>

<p>One thing to check when you arrive is what bit of T5 you arrive in, and where you go from. T5 actually has three buildings, linked by an underground shuttle train, T5A (the main bit), T5B and T5C. If you arrive at B or C gates, and depart again from B or C, you can clear flight connections and security there, which is generally a lot quieter. However, if either flight involves the main A gates, you'll have to do security there, which can have delays at busy times.</p>

<p>I've managed to find a CC-BY photo from <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/22819720@N02/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Terminal 5 Insider</a> which shows what you'd see at T5A:

<p>This is at the far end of the Purple Flight Connections signs in T5A. To your right are the desks, where you'd go to collect your onward boarding pass if you didn't already have it. To the left is the UK border, which you'd have got to if you'd followed the yellow arrivals signs instead. Straight ahead is where they'll check your passport and scan your onwarding boarding pass, then it's up the escalators in the background to get to security. You need to get your boarding pass scanned by 35 minutes before departure (conformance), so with 2 hours you'll be fine!</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""http://www.hsl.fi/EN/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">HSL</a> <strong>bus 615</strong> is easy and affordable.  The trip to central railway station costs <strong>5€</strong> and takes some 35 mins. The bus runs every 10-20 minutes between 06:30 and 00:30 on weekdays (Sat 07:00-1:00, Sun 06:05-00:30). (From city to airport, first departure is 05:10 and last   22:45.)

The fare is <strong>6.30€</strong>, and it runs (mostly) every 20 minutes, between 05:45 and 01:10 daily. (From city to airport between 05:00 and 24:00).
This bus leaves from T2 (platform 10) and stops at T1 (platform 1); in city centre, it leaves from <em><a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/07cYj"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Elielinaukio</a></em>, platform 30, on the other side of the central railway station. The Finnair bus also provides free WiFi (details provided on the information display on the bus), which can be handy for travelers.</p></li>

It runs every half hour mostly, with last departure from airport at 03:55 and from city at 03:10 (Fri &amp; Sat nights 03:40). But first departure is at 05:00 (from city 04:10), so <strong>essentially the whole night is covered</strong>, all week! Night fare (charged between 02:00-04:30) is <strong>7€</strong>. The 620 departs from the exact same platforms as 615, and estimated travel time is 40-45 minutes. (The 620 also has departures during daytime; the main difference compared to 615 is slightly longer travel time.) </p>

<p>A <strong>taxi</strong> is always a convenient option, of course, but it's far from cheap (around 35-40€). There are some fixed rate / shared taxi services too that are slightly cheaper (e.g. <a href=""http://www.airporttaxi.fi/index_airporttaxi_en.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Airport Taxi</a>, ""from 19.50€"").</p>

"Why are you now required NOT to smile in passport photos?","56504","","<p>Passport photos these days are usually pretty specific - certain size, color, etc.</p>

<p>But the odd requirement the past few years is that usually you're not allowed to smile in them.</p>

<p>We're discussing this here at work, and for every semi-reasonable reason we can come up with, we can come up with a reason why it is daft, so we're now left wondering why.</p>

<p>Anyone got an OFFICIAL reason?</p>
","<p>The contents of the main page in a passport is dictated by standards set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), specifically the Machine Readable Travel Documents standard (<a href=""http://www.icao.int/Security/mrtd/Downloads/Forms/AllItems.aspx?RootFolder=/Security/mrtd/Downloads/Doc%209303/Doc%209303%20English"">Doc 9303</a>).</p>

<p>This document states that all passport photos should meet the following requirements:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li><p>Pose<br>
  1.1. The photograph should be less than six months old.<br>
  1.2. It should show a close up of the head and shoulders.<br>
  1.3. The photograph should be taken so that an imaginary horizontal line between the centres of the eyes is parallel to the top edge of the picture.<br>
  1.4. The face should be in sharp focus and clear with no blemishes such as ink marks, pen, pin, paper clip, staples, folds, dents, or creases.<br>
  1.5. The photograph should show the subject facing square on and looking directly at the camera with a neutral expression and the mouth closed.<br>
  1.6. The chin to crown (crown is the position of the top of the head if there were no hair) shall be 70 -80% of the vertical height of the picture.<br>
  1.7. The eyes must be open and there must be no hair obscuring them.<br>
  1.8. If the subject wears glasses, the photograph must show the eyes clearly with no lights reflected in the glasses. The glasses shall not have tinted lenses. Avoid heavy frames if possible and ensure that the frames do not cover any part of the eyes. Sunglasses cannot be worn or appear on the person’s head.<br>
  1.9. Coverings, hair, headdress, hats, scarfs, head bands, bandanas or facial ornamentation which obscure the face, are not permitted (except for religious or medical reasons. In all cases, the person’s full facial features from bottom of chin to top of forehead and both edges of the face must be clearly visible).<br>
  1.10. The photograph must have a plain light coloured background.<br>
  1.11. There must be no other people, chair back, or objects in the photograph.  </p></li>
  <li><p>Lighting, Exposure, and Colour Balance<br>
  2.1. The lighting must be uniform with no shadows or reflections on the face, eye-glasses or in the background.<br>
  2.2. The subject’s eyes must not show red eye.<br>
  2.3. The photograph must have appropriate brightness and contrast.<br>
  2.4. Where the picture is in colour, the lighting, and photographic process must be colour balanced to render skin tones faithfully.  </p></li>
  <li><p>Submission of Portrait to the Issuing Authority<br>
  Where the portrait is supplied to the Issuing Authority in the form of a print, the photograph, whether produced using conventional photographic or digital techniques, should be on good or photo-quality paper.</p></li>
  <li><p>Compliance with International Standards<br>
  4.1. The photograph shall comply with the appropriate definitions set out in ISO/IEC 1974 – 5.</p></li>

<p>The last of the points above is probably the most important as far as ""why"" - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_19794-5"">ISO/IEC 19794</a> defines standards for Biometric data interchange formats, with part 5 specifically being Face image data. According to the ISO/IEC 19794 documents:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To enable many applications on variety of devices, including devices
  that have the limited resources required for data storage, and to
  improve face recognition accuracy, <strong>this part of ISO/IEC 19794
  specifies not only a data format, but also scene constraints
  (lighting, pose, expression, etc.), photographic properties
  (positioning, camera focus, etc.), digital image attributes (image
  resolution, image size, etc.).</strong></p>

"What happens to checked luggage when there's an overnight layover?","56426","","<p>I have an overnight layover as part of a single itinerary. Does the airline store the checked luggage overnight, or make me pick it up and then re-check it?</p>

<p>If they store it and I needed access to the luggage, can this be arranged at the time of check in?</p>

<p>If instead I don't need to access my luggage and don't want to deal with storing it, can I ask the airline to keep my luggage for me?</p>
","<p>The simple answer is, it depends!  Each airline, and even sometimes each airport, will have different rules about what is and is not allowed.</p>

<p>As a general rule, most airlines will NOT automatically check your luggage through for an overnight connection. You will normally need collect your luggage when you land, and re-check it the following morning.  This is normally a good thing as it allows you access to your luggage for your overnight stay.</p>

<p>However this is not true for all airlines - some WILL check your luggage through, especially for short overnight stays (eg, arrive 11:30pm, depart 5:30am).</p>

<p>The only way to find out exactly what they are going to do is to ask the airline, and even then you might find that when you get to the airport they proceed to do something different anyway!</p>

<p>If you want access to your luggage at the stopover point then basically all airlines will honor such a request at check-in. This is called ""short-checking"", and although not all airlines will do it in a general sense, they all should for an overnight layover.</p>

<p>If you want them to keep your luggage overnight, then it may be a bit more of a struggle.  Some airlines, and even some airports, have policies that they simply will not do this - so whilst you can ask, be ready for a refusal.  The one time you may be able to talk them into doing this where they otherwise refuse is if you are not able to go through passport control at the connecting country (eg, you don't have a visa), in which case you will not be able collect your luggage - in this case they may be more willing to check it all the way through, however I would not bet on this always being successful.</p>

"What section of an airplane offers the smoothest ride?","55939","","<p>I know in a bus, for instance, (well, at least on a school bus, when I traveled to out-of-town basketball games in high school) the farther back you are, the bumpier your ride tends to be. Is there a similar situation when a vehicle is airborne?</p>

<p>For the quietest ride, you clearly want to sit away from the engines.  But I'm curious if there is a part of the airplane that offers the smoothest ride.  That is, most free from vibrations during flight, or during take-off and landing.</p>

<p>I imagine the answer may be different for aircraft that have their engines mounted on the tail versus those with the engines mounted on the wings.  And maybe other factors play into the equation as well.</p>
","<p>It varies a little depending on the type of plane, but in general during flight over the wings, or slightly forward of the wings gives the least amount of movement - especially for planes where the engines are mounted on the wings (rather than on/near the tail).</p>

<p>Take-off/landing is a little different.  For take-off there's not a lot of difference - the nose of the plane leaves the ground first so there's normally a sharper movement at the front as that occurs, but the front is also off the ground earlier so potentially less bumpy for a short period of time.</p>

<p>For landing, the intention is for the rear wheels to hit the ground first, followed by the nose wheels.  Presuming that happens, the front is much more smooth, and feels less of the bounce as the plane initially hits the ground.  In a bad landing the nose wheel can hit the ground around the same time as the other wheels, which causes a shock at the front of the plane worse than what you'd normally feel at the back - but that's pretty rare.</p>

<p>Of course, the other way to answer the question is that the ""smoothest"" ride is in whichever part of the plane First Class is - if only because the seats are more comfortable (and the alcohol is free!) so you won't feel the bumps as much as in economy.</p>

<p>He's flying with Air Asia, Air New Zealand, and JetStar.</p>

<p>Is it ok to turn up with the expired passport for ID, and use the new one to travel, or is there another step he needs to do?</p>
","<p>Most airlines allow you to manage bookings either online or by calling up their customer care numbers. Charges may apply for making changes but more often than not they are applied for changing flights rather than changing passenger details. (N.B. Changing the passenger who will fly is almost <em>never</em> allowed.)</p>

<p>Air Asia does have an online booking management option and <a href=""http://www.airasia.com/ask/template.do?id=309"">states in its FAQ</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you have booked using your old passport details which has now
  expired, you can update your new passport details online via Manage My
  Booking, contact our call centre for assistance, or visit our nearest
  sales office/airport sales counter to update your booking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Air New Zealand doesn't explicitly state whether changes to passport details are allowed but <a href=""https://airnzukeu.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1802/p/130"">its FAQ does state</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However if you complete a booking and later find you have made a
  genuine mistake, please Air New Zealand just as soon as you realise.
  We'll do whatever we can to help.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You could always tell Air NZ that you accidentally entered expired passport details instead of the new one. This should be allowed as this is mostly a case of updating their passenger information system.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.jetstar.com/au/en/planning-and-booking/booking-with-jetstar/change-a-booking"">JetStar also allows changes to bookings online</a>. I've flown with them and I do remember there being an option to update passenger details. However, I don't have a current booking with them so I can't confirm this for sure (but it probably <em>is</em> present).</p>

<p>It's advisable to make the change online or by calling up the airline in advance. Most don't make a big fuss of it and rather that than having to explain an employee at the checkin counter.</p>

<p>One more thing. This isn't related to this particular case but it's an important point so I think I should mention it. <a href=""http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/TravelAndTransport/Foreigntravel/AirTravel/DG_176737"">Flights to/from the US require passengers to update details on US Customs and Border Protection's Advance Passenger Information System (APIS)</a> through their airlines, although requirements on who need to provide this varies. In this situation it certainly becomes important to update passport details in advance. However, I've found that even airlines which don't fly to the US or on flights that don't go the US ask for APIS details; possibly because they're plugging in the same server-side processing software and can't be bothered to customise it?</p>

"Advice for flying with a 6 month old infant?","55382","","<p>We are going to have our first flight with our 6 month-old child.
The flight will be 12 hours long.</p>

<p>Is there anything we need to pay special attention to?
Anything we might overlook?</p>

<p><strong>FEEDBACK</strong></p>

<p>Ok, so we just came back from our holidays. The tips given here were really helpful. 
However, we found out our child was afraid of the dark : since it was a night flight, they dim the lights during take-off. Unfortunately, we found that out when they put the lights back on, when we reached the cruising altitude. Apart from that, all went fine.</p>
","<p><strong>Before you travel - book early</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Make sure to book early enough so that you can get seats with access to a bassinet (travel cots). You need to call the airline directly to reserve such seats. Note that a travel cot/bassinet does not count as a seat for the baby. You'll still have to hold the kid during take-off and landing. </li>
<li>If you do not manage to get a bassinet, bring a baby carrier onto the plane so that you can strap the baby onto you, so that you don't have to hold him/her the entire time. </li>
<li>If you do want to shell out for an seat for the baby, check ahead of time whether your car seat will fit (hint: in some low-cost carriers, it may not, since the seats are too narrow).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Before you travel - be aware of the rules and regulations</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>You are usually allowed to take e.g. breast milk with you through security check (<a href=""http://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/traveling-children"">TSA link</a> - while security procedures are similar in many places, check you local regulations as well). You can use that to take non-breastmilk liquid for babies as well.</li>
<li>You can usually check-in a car seat at no additional cost (even though you have not paid for a seat for the child). Pack it in a sturdy plastic bag, not all airlines will provide you with one.</li>
<li>You can usually bring a foldable (but not detachable) stroller directly to the gate, which helps you to limit your child's mobility, if needed. The stroller will have to be gate-checked, which tends to be a bit less of a damage-risk. Check with the airline, though.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>At the airport</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>You need to check bags anyway (diapers, lots of baby clothes...); limit the amount of carry-on luggage so that you have your hands free for the kid (and the stroller, and the toys the kid just threw away as you hurry towards the gate).</li>
<li>The airport may have fast-track queues for families with small children, as well as special waiting areas. Use them!</li>
<li>Although you are allowed to pre-board, you may want to choose to board at the very end only, especially if the child is already mobile and doesn't like to be confined to its seat while waiting for other passengers to find their seat. Of course, if you're worried about having enough space for your cabin luggage, enjoy pre-boarding :)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>During the flight</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Relax. Your child will most likely cry, and some people may be offended by that, but hey, tough luck for them. Feeling stressed out to have to calm the child, or yelling at him/her to shut up will only make matters worse. </li>
<li>Note that you need to hold the child facing you during take-off and landing (unless the child is in its own seat), so that can be a good time for (breast-)feeding the child, since the swallowing helps with ear pressure (you can, but don't have to be, lucky in that your kid does not suffer much from pressure change). </li>
<li>Make sure there is a vomit bag in your seat pocket, and that you can grab it reasonably quickly. In my personal experience, the most critical period for vomiting is either during or right after landing. </li>
<li>Remember there are lots of people who think babies are cute, and would love to hold the little bundle of joy, while you go to the bathroom, or relax for a moment. Let them help you.</li>

<p>Are they allowed to hold your passport until you come back and pay? What happens if they call the police? Are you going to be fined? Can the police or other authorities lend you money in this or other more critical situations?</p>

<p>I know this can be a general question about what happens if you run out of money while being abroad, but a hotel is the most common travel-related post-paid service.</p>
","<p>In many hotels you can just drop your keys in a box on your way out (or leave them in your room) and the charges will go to the credit card on file. Should you become aware that the card won't work, one approach would simply be to stay as long as you had intended, pack your bags, and just leave. Undoubtedly the hotel will call or email you within a few days looking for their money, and you can sort it all out then. Nobody detains you, there's no talk of police or fines or jail, you settle your bill and that's that.</p>

<p>What if you discover the problem only as you are checking out? Pretty much the same approach. You try a few things - another credit card, offering them a debit card, and so on. If one of those works, great. If not, you put your stuff back in your room and leave the hotel to go sort it out. (Dragging your stuff around while you settle a problem would be a pain, so you want to leave it, and it makes them feel they have a hold on you. But it's in your room and you have a key, so really they don't, right?) If you're sure you can't sort it out anywhere in this town, and it's a large hotel so they can't really track your coming and going, you can go out for a while, then return to your room and leave with your stuff, leaving the key, and sort it out over the next few days. </p>

<p>If it's a small hotel, a B &amp; B almost, that will see you every time you come in or go out, then just plain leaving is a little more problematic. They could try to prevent you from leaving. You will have to be open with them. Try all the possible solutions. For example, in Canada we can email each other money, so I could ask a friend to email me money, which would go into my bank account, then pay with a debit card all in about 20 minutes (after locating a friend who is willing to help of course, and with a device available for getting my email and clicking links.) Or the same thing, but I go out to an ATM and withdraw cash if the hotel doesn't take debit. If you try all these solutions in front of them - emailing and calling people, calling your credit card company and so on - they may begin to trust you that you aren't trying to rip them off, and let you leave to sort it out at home. </p>

<p>It is going to boil down to whether people believe you are trying to cheat them, or really had a problem. A business traveller in a large expensive hotel will have a lot less trouble than a backpacker in a small hotel. I don't think any authorities will lend you money; the best they might do is vouch to the hotel (for example that you really were robbed) so that you can leave and pay the bill when you get home.</p>

"What is the cheapest way to get from Eindhoven to Amsterdam?","54456","","<p>What is the cheapest way to get from Eindhoven or Eindhoven airport to Amsterdam and back?</p>
","<p>I'm currently working in our Eindhoven office and can see the runway from here ;)</p>

<p>Hitchhiking is unlikely to work; there's no decent location to get picked up near the airport. The A2 highway is close, yes, but there's no parking lot or something similar. Furthermore, you're not allowed to walk on the highway itself. You'd have to post on the on-ramp, but there's no room to stop there.</p>

<p>The train would be easy, and there are 7 buses per hour to the station. Pick the 401 (22 minutes; it uses a reserved buslane so no traffic jams); the 103 takes a horrible detour. Costs 3 euros one way, and you'll need coins for that.</p>

<p>There are actually 4 trains per hour to Amsterdam; two of them go to Central Station and the other 2 go to Amsterdam Airport (south of the city). Depending on where you're going, either route is an option. All trains stop in Utrecht, where you can transfer.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Do they seal the passport as my application was rejected? I understand each embassy has their own records, but they mark it in the passport?</p></li>
<li><p>Are there any known automatic rejections if I was rejected a visa for another country? All my applications to country B get rejected because my application to country A visa was rejected? </p></li>
</ul>
","<p>It can differ from country to country, and also depends on what visa you're applying for, and going into every country would be a book in itself, so I'll try and provide a general answer.</p>

<p>In general, countries that share information could share visa rejections. So travelling to country B, you may be flagged and asked questions about it.</p>

<p>Often, you have to sign a form indicating whether or not you were ever rejected for a visa to ANYWHERE, on any passport, current or present. The result of that may affect your application.  For example, the US states that <a href=""https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/1097/~/previously-denied-a-visa-or-immigration-benefit"" rel=""noreferrer"">you'll most likely get a visa application denied if you've previously had a rejection</a>.</p>

<p>I would assume I will have to. But if I have no money of any kind, then what happens?</p>
","<p>It depends both on local legislation (in the country you are denied entry) and the terms and conditions of the carrier bringing you there.</p>

<p>If you are travelling by air, the air line will of course check that you have all necessary travel documents before they let you board the flight at all, but if I understand your question correctly, you are asking what will happen if you are denied entry at the border even if your travel documents and visas are ok? Even if the air line has done everything in their power to check your eligibility to enter the destination country, they are in most cases still required by national law (in the destination country) to either bring you back to the origin country or if you are not eligible to reenter the origin country, to bring you anywhere else.</p>

<p>If you are travelling on a return ticket, most airlines are fair enough to let you use your return ticket for the unexpected return flight. Aside from that, most air lines regulate this in their terms of carriage and hold the passenger liable for any further costs. </p>

<p>Just as an example, here are Lufthansa's terms regarding denied entry. But as I said, you will find similar regulations in other air lines' terms of carriage as well:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Refusal of Entry 13.3.</strong> If you are denied entry into any country, you will be responsible to pay any fine or charge assessed against us
  by the Government concerned and for the cost of transporting you from
  that country. We may apply to the payment of such fare any funds paid
  to us for unused carriage, or any funds of the passenger in the
  possession of us. The fare collected for carriage to the point of
  refusal of entry or deportation will not be refunded by us.</p>

"Flight tickets: buy two weeks before even during holiday seasons?","51381","","<p>There is a common story that airline ticket prices rise significantly if you buy them less than two weeks before departure.  And that any time before that will yield standard prices.</p>

<p>Is that advice valid for flying during holiday seasons?</p>

<p>As an example: if I want to fly coast to coast USA on December 7th, must I buy my ticket ASAP, or would I get a similar price buying on November 21st?</p>
","<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong>  If you know you're going, and there's a fare you can afford, book it. Waiting will almost never save you money, and never enough to offset paying double or triple the cheapo fare because you waited too long.</p>

<p><strong>Detailed explanation, with pictures:</strong>
The problem is that there is no single ""the price"" that goes up and down. On any given flight you can buy as many as a dozen different tickets, each at a different price. They carry different privileges -- eligible to earn frequent flyer miles, lower change fees, lounge access, seat selection included, less credits needed to upgrade, free meal, etc -- depending on the airline. Often, some or all of those privileges mean very little to you and you will just buy the cheapest one. When all of the absolutely cheapest ones are gone, you have to buy the next most expensive class, and that means you will pay more.</p>

<p>So how do prices go up? By the cheapest seats getting bought. How do they go down? By those seats being cancelled and returned to the pool (unlikely, since they have high change fees and are bought by people who have firm plans), by discount codes or overall ""seat sales"" being issued, or by seats being moved from one class to another.</p>

<p>That last thing is called ""yield management"" and it is what some very smart people do for a living. They don't want a plane to go out with an empty seat (getting $0 for it) but they don't want to sell it to you 3 months in advance for $200 if somebody with an urgent need to travel would pay $1500 for it the week of the flight. So they might decide to move an unsold seat from the $1500 fare class to the $200 fare class, but only if they are sure that's the only way they'll sell it. You can see that they can go out with an empty seat 5 times, and the 6th time sell the seat for a premium, and still be ahead overall. They are pretty good at guessing how many ""urgent needs"" are likely to arise in a given week. And trust me, the holiday season is rich in ""urgent needs"". The chances of cheaper seats being available right when <em>everyone</em> wants to fly are slim to none.</p>

<p>There are ways to watch the fare classes on a given flight. For example Air Canada offers Tango, Tango Plus, Latitude, Discount Business, and Business. Tango and Tango plus actually have some smaller fare classes inside them. If you look at a random city pair on a random day, you will see something like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YH0AY.jpg"" alt=""fares YYZ-YVR Dec 23rd as of Oct 23rd""></p>

<p>You can see that already, on many of the flights, all of the Tango fares are gone. There are clearly two prices for Tango, and only one flight has the cheaper one left. Similarly there are 3 prices for Tango Plus. And so on. As it gets closer and closer, fares will disappear from some flights. Over time, you can get familiar with the patterns between two cities. You might notice that the 7am flight is alway last to lose its cheap fares, and wait till you see a pattern like this one before you buy. As always, it helps to be unusual. If you prefer a flight at a time of day most people don't (like 7am) you can pay less. If you aren't trying to fly the Friday before Xmas, you'll pay less. And so on.</p>

<p>But look at the difference between Tango and Tango plus here. When all that's left is $597 fares on every flight, they can have a 20% off sale and bring it down to $477 - but you would have been better off with $364 in the first place. </p>

<p>If you know you're going, and there's a fare you can afford, book it. Waiting will almost never save you money, and never enough to offset paying double or triple the cheapo fare because you waited too long.</p>

<p><strong>Update Nov 7th, two weeks later:</strong></p>

<p>Look what has now happened to that same YYZ-YVR flight on the same date, Dec 23rd:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/apHmo.jpg"" alt=""fares YYZ-YVR Dec 23rd as of Nov 7th""></p>

<p>Every flight has gone up dramatically, except (for some strange reason) for the last flight of the day. Waiting a few weeks to book would have cost you hundreds of dollars. </p>

<p>Let's also look at a flight two weeks later (the same distance from today as my first set of prices, but not a holiday) </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tXeNT.jpg"" alt=""fares YYZ-YVR Jan 7th as of Nov 7th""></p>

<p>See how much cheaper those Dec 23rd flights might have been before Oct 23rd, when I took the first screenshot? The cheapest is 229 (each way, before taxes and addons, but that's not the point) while today the cheapest for the 23rd is 374, almost double, and if landing at 1am Vancouver time, 4 am body time, doesn't seem feasible then it's going to be $607, almost triple. Ouch. I see no benefit to waiting... but I plan to update this answer again in a few weeks :-)</p>

<p><strong>Update Nov 24th, two-and-a-bit weeks closer to Xmas:</strong></p>

<p>Still looking at YYZ-YVR on Friday Dec 23rd, same airline:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/mYVXF.jpg"" alt=""fares YYZ-YVR Dec 23rd as of Nov 24th""></p>

<p>Now it's really awful. The cheapest is $607, in fact some of the economy classes now being sold cost more than sitting in business class would cost!</p>

<p>Again let's advance to some point as far away from now as Dec 23rd was when I started this.  Say Jan 23rd. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kCq8c.jpg"" alt=""fares YYZ-YVR Jan 23rd as of Nov 24th""></p>

<p>Wow! Now some flights are as little as $199! Notice also that there are two less flights on Jan 23rd than on Dec 23rd. The airline has added as much capacity as it can for the route on the popular day - the tickets just keep getting bought!</p>

<p><strong>Update Dec 16th:</strong> So now it's less than two weeks to that Dec 23rd flight home for Xmas. What bargains has the waiter achieved?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GFUVh.jpg"" alt=""yyz-yvr prices on Dec 16th""></p>

<p>The lowest possible price is still $607, so there hasn't been much lost by waiting. And that last flight of the day has become cheaper somehow. Some particular flights are cheaper (the noon flight has gone down $100) than they were Nov 24th. But they are ALL far more expensive than they were in late October. I think for the case of Xmas, if I had a time preference, having left it to one-month-before I might try to gut it out to two-weeks-before in the hope of getting my preferred time. But the smart thing to have done was to book two-months-before, or more. $607 might look good compared to $1279 (all these prices are one way before fees and taxes) but it's actually brutally high considering you would normally see $199 or less one way before fees and taxes for that city pair.</p>

<p>Remember, too, that this is not the airline ripping you off because it's Xmas. They always had $604 tickets and $1279 tickets on sale for every flight every day. Normally speaking, people don't buy those tickets. That's the difference. Other people beat you to the $199 ones.</p>

"Best way to make my ears pop?","51230","","<p>What is the best way to make my ears pop when landing on a plane? The hold-your-nose-and-pitch method is very painful; are there any other methods to pop ears?</p>
","<p>While a full yawn is best, simulating the movement your jaw makes in a yawn is enough to pop your ears (and often simulating a yawn makes a real one happen anyway)</p>

"Will my passport number change when I renew it?","51123","","<p>I'm travelling soon but need to renew my passport.</p>

<p>Given that I have to provide my passport number to the airline to book a flight, I was wondering if my passport number would change if I renew it.</p>

<p>Or would the number stay the same and the expiry date just change?</p>

<p><em>I'm asking specifically as an Australian citizen, although I suspect a 'common' answer (if there is a general way this works) might be useful too.</em></p>
","<p><strong>All biometric passports have serial numbers that change when issued.</strong> Per this notice from the Singaporean government, this is an ICAO requirement: <a href=""https://www.ica.gov.sg/news_details.aspx?nid=12246"">https://www.ica.gov.sg/news_details.aspx?nid=12246</a></p>

<p>And since virtually all passports are now biometric, even those countries (like Singapore) that did not previously change numbers do so now.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Here's <a href=""http://www.icao.int/publications/Documents/9303_p4_cons_en.pdf"">Document 9303-4</a> ""Specifications for Machine Readable Passports (MRPs) and other TD3 Size MRTDs"" direct from the <a href=""http://www.icao.int/security/mrtd/Pages/default.aspx"">ICAO Machine Readable Travel Documents Programme</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Field 05/I (Mandatory)</p>
  
  <p>Passport Number </p>
  
  <p>As given by the issuing State or organization to uniquely identify the
  document from all other MRTDs [machine readable travel documents] issued by the State or organization.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>""Uniquely identify the document"" means that the number cannot be reused for other documents.  And of course it's only a ""recommendation"", because ICAO only sets standards and does not enforce them -- but if countries produce passports that don't follow the rules, they're not going to be accepted by other countries.  In particular, <a href=""http://www.icao.int/Security/mrtd/Pages/24-NOV-2015.aspx"">ICAO member states are supposed to ensure that non-MRP passports are no longer accepted after November 24, 2015</a>.</p>

<p>And a final nit: the standard above is technically for machine-readable passports, which is not <em>quite</em> the same thing as biometric passports, but the standard in question does document the rules of biometric passports, and all biometric passports are supposed to follow the rule above.</p>

"What is the best method for exchanging dollars for Euros?","49909","","<p>I'm traveling from the US to Europe in a few weeks.  <strong>When and what is the best method of exchanging dollars for Euros</strong>?  </p>

<p>I imagine there's options like:</p>

<ul>
<li>at the airport when you arrive in Europe</li>
<li>at a bank in the US before you leave</li>
<li>at a bank in Europe upon arriving</li>
</ul>
","<p>I use five strategies to pay for things when I travel:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The best rates are often the rates you get with your <strong>American credit card or debit card</strong>. Try to charge as much as you can. The fees are very low and the exchange rates are fair. However, many American banks charge several dollars for every foreign currency transaction, so if you plan to spend a lot of time in Europe, you may want to apply for a <em>credit card with low or free foreign currency transactions</em>. Right now, Capital One has a reputation for being the best deal on foreign currency.</p></li>
<li><p>My second favorite strategy is to <strong>get cash out of foreign ATMs using my own bank's debit card attached to my checking account</strong>. I've never had a problem with this, but I have heard that if your PIN is more than 4 digits, it may not work internationally. There are a few countries where most ATMs don't like American bank cards, notoriously Japan. In Japan, if you can find a post office, they have ATMs that are happy to accept American bank cards.</p></li>
<li><p>Any kind of transaction that involves a human being standing behind a <strong>counter changing money</strong> for you is going to be bloody expensive. Like, 15% expensive... or more. You have to pay for the person and the counter. I very rarely do this.</p></li>
<li><p>Very rarely, in Europe, you will find yourself dealing with an <strong>automatic machine that ONLY accepts credit cards and which keeps asking you for a PIN or refusing to read your American credit card</strong>. The most common places I've had this happen:</p>

<ul>
<li>Automatic ticket machines at railroad stations</li>
<li>Bicycle rental machines</li>
<li>Unattended gas stations</li>
<li>Toll booths in France</li>
</ul>

<p>Essentially what's happening here is that European credit cards have an embedded chip and require a PIN, while American credit cards use a magnetic stripe. <strong>In some situations in Europe you must pay with a Chip and PIN credit card</strong>. See <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/3203/how-can-americans-get-a-chip-and-pin-credit-card-for-use-while-abroad"">this question</a> for information about getting a chip and pin card as an American. There is some evidence that <a href=""http://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/articles/2014/10/28/coming-next-fall-more-chip-and-pin-cards-in-the-us"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Chip and PIN cards will be widely available to US bankcard holders in Fall 2015</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>In a pinch, you'll discover that nicer <strong>hotels are often happy to convert money for you</strong>. The rates are not very good, but if you keep a few hundred dollars in US cash hidden away somewhere safe, it'll get you out of just about any kind of situation.</p></li>

"How to best respond to a request to send a passport scan by unsecured email?","49361","","<p>It is not uncommon for travel or holiday accommodation companies to ask for a scan of your passport by email. Sometimes local laws require them to keep a record of the passport numbers of all visitors. I'm happy to provide that information but you usually have to send it in an unsecured email, which may have consequences <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/13464/what-harm-can-be-done-with-a-copy-of-ones-passport"">as discussed in another question</a>.</p>

<p>Could these companies be more responsible, and provide a public cryptographic key at least?</p>

<p>Are there other steps you should take to protect yourself, if you do send by unsecured email?</p>
","<p>If a travel agent or someone in an allied industry needs a copy of your passport, you can always send an image with redacted information.  This is an example from the Home Office site...</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q7Dkm.jpg"" alt=""Redacted information""></p>

<p>As can be seen, information which is exempt is blotted out (blue rectangles).  It shows, yes, you are a British citizen; yes, you have a current passport, and yes, it was issued in the UK.  That's all that <em>should</em> be required.  Secondary abuse by personnel handling your image at the travel agency is eliminated.</p>

<p>In some jurisdictions, redaction is a legal requirement.  Consider this extract from Texas, US which lists the information that should be redacted...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unless the Court orders otherwise, an e-filed document must not
  contain a social security number; a birth date; a home address; the
  name of any person who was a minor when underlying suit was filed; a
  driver’s license number, passport number, tax identification number,
  or similar government-issued personal identification number; or a bank
  account number, credit card number, or other financial account number.
  The e-filer must redact all of this information in accordance with the
  redaction guidelines posted by the Court’s Clerk on the Court’s
  website; however, the e-filed document may contain a reference to this
  information as long as the reference does not include any part of the
  actual information (e.g., “passport number”). For good cause, the
  Court may order redaction of additional information</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""https://www.casefilexpress.com/Supreme%20Court%20eFiling%20Mandate%2011915200.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://www.casefilexpress.com/Supreme%20Court%20eFiling%20Mandate%2011915200.pdf</a></p>

<p>In the case of Mass, US, they indicate that the last four digits of the passport number be excluded from redaction...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>in the case of a social security number, taxpayer identification
  number, credit card or other financial account number, driver’s
  license number, state-issued identification card number, or passport
  number, only the last four digits; and</p>

<p>The rules for redaction are different depending upon jurisdiction. In the UK, bank statements submitted for visa evidence can have the account numbers redacted.</p>

<p>If a travel agent objects to redaction, especially if the courts in their jurisdiction allow it (i.e., they are over and above their own government), then you should consider if the staff do not understand the requirements, or finally that the agent should not be trusted.  In all events, if you really NEED to send exempt information, you can send it via separate cover.  </p>

<p>Airlines and other entities that have a LEGITIMATE need for your passport number and DOB invariably use secure channels anyway.</p>

<p>NOTE: for purposes of this answer, I included the right hand side of the portrait page only. There is nothing on the left hand side that needs redaction unless the passport holder is a minor.</p>

"Greyhound: How early should I get to the bus station?","49200","","<p>Some bad fortune has required me to change my Thanksgiving travel plans at the last minute. I canceled my train ticket and bought a Greyhound bus ticket instead. I'm concerned by this language on the ticket:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Seating is first-come, first-served. In case of insufficient seating capacity,
  passengers will be placed on succeeding schedules that have available seats.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I intentionally bought a late departure (overnight trip) ticket. Now I'm worried that was a mistake, if there will be a cascade of travelers bumped from earlier buses competing for seats. Is there anything I can do to ensure I get a seat on the bus I intended to?</p>
","<p>Normally you being there in plenty of time should ensure you are the first-came, and excess passengers would be put on after the rest of you.  However, this is Greyhound we're talking about, and to further complicate, this is Thanksgiving, the day of the year rules just don't apply ;)</p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://everything2.com/title/Greyhound+bus"">one source</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As the ticket policy suggests,
  Greyhound does not assign you a seat when you buy a ticket. If you
  show up at 8 AM for your 8 AM bus, the bus may be full. If you show up
  at 7:30 AM and the bus line already has 55 people in it, you may not
  get to ride that bus. If you're riding for your first time, you will
  get a good seat on your bus if you arrive an hour ahead of time, and
  will probably catch it (unless you need to check bags) if you arrive
  fifteen minutes ahead of time.</p>
  
  <p>For the expert, how early you show up can be calculated by four
  variables: (1) Are you checking bags? (2) Is your bus ""originating?""
  (3) Is your departure station popular? (4) Is the route popular?</p>
  
  <p>If you're checking bags, you will have to wait in line. Depending on
  station , you may have to wait in the
  general ticketing line. At peak times, there can be 30 people in the
  general ticketing line--all of which have urgent needs. You don't have
  a choice about waiting, so budget 15-30 minutes.</p>
  
  <p>An ""originating"" bus means that your bus will be empty when boarding
  begins. If your bus is originating, you can show up later, because
  more seats will be available.</p>
  
  <p>If your departure station is popular (i.e. a large city), more people
  will be in line, so budget another 15 minutes. If the route is popular
  (and most are, especially on the weekends and at night), you may wish
  to budget another 15-30 minutes.</p>
  
  <p>Your best situation is an originating bus, leaving from small town X,
  at 10 AM. Your worst situation is a North Hollywood bus originating in
  Los Angeles, CA going to San Francisco at 10 PM on a Friday night.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So given all that, I'd try and get there as early as you possibly can.  Because after all, this is <em>Thanksgiving</em>, and you'll already be thankful you have a seat ;)</p>

"Best way to transfer Indian rupees to Bank of America?","49122","","<p>I am travelling to USA for a stay about 1 year. I have recently opened an account in the bank of America. Now I want to deposit some cash for my stay in the same account. Please let me know the best possible way I can deposit my liquid INR to US$ in the bank of America account.</p>
","<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: If you have &lt; $1000 - &lt; $2000 worth of money, use a travel card (you can easily get one from Axis Bank) otherwise use a wire transfer for either your Bank Account or from a Forex Service.</p>

<p>I happen to have a BoA account as well, so I do this quite often. In India, <strong>in order to transfer money to the US, you have three options,</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use your local bank in which you have an account with all that money in it. If you have most of your money in cash, then your best bet is to deposit this in an account because that's what they will need in order to wire transfer to BoA. This would ideally be the easiest way if your money is already in a bank account. Axis Bank is one of the better bank which you could do this with, because they provide a lot of forex services such as travel cards and all as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Use remittance services with a leading foreign exchange service such as <a href=""http://www.thomascook.in/tcportal/Foreign-Exchange/Remittance"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Thomas Cook</a>. They might be willing to take cash as well but they might require you to write them a check from a bank account. If you absolutely want to use cash, I think a PAN Card would be required in order to make sure that the cash can be associated to your account for taxation purposes.</p></li>
<li><p>Get a free <a href=""http://www.axisbank.com/personal/forex/travel-currency-card/travel-currency-card-features.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">travel card with Axis Bank</a> or any other service and load that with all your money in it and make a withdrawal using any ATM in the US and deposit all the money in your BoA account using the Travel Card.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Now, let's talk about the costs,</strong></p>

<p>Unforunately this depends more on your negotiation skills that anything else, for a small amount i.e &lt; $1000, carrying in your Travel Card would be a better option, otherwise, using one of the two services I mentioned is better.</p>

<p>Now, I have gotten better rates from the bank as well as 3rd party dealers with respect to Forex Bank Transfers but typically for larger amounts i.e > $10000 you are looking at an additional rate of about 0.3 - 0.5%. For the travel card, the rate is usually 1% is the norm.</p>

<p>Note: BoA will charge you about $12 for an incoming wire transfer whereas the banks I mentioned might charge you a flat fee of about $10 or Rs. 500 for both travel cards and wire transfers. As you might expect, these depend on the Bank/Forex Service. If you carry the travel card and you withdraw money from the card, a fee of $2 is usually charged by the withdrawing ATM (in this case a BoA ATM) and of course to deposit the money into your account, (maximum of $800 per transaction in both cases i.e if you have more, then you need to withdraw and deposit multiple times).</p>

<p><strong>Lastly, what documentation do you require,</strong></p>

<p>Simple, all you need is the Swift Code <a href=""https://www.bankofamerica.com/deposits/manage/faq-wire-transfers.go"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">(For BoA USD trasfers BOFAUS3N)</a> of the bank and the Bank Account (either Checking or Saving, any one is OK) number you wish to transfer to and although not required, but the branch of the bank will be additional information which won't hurt. Basically any information which is required to uniquely identify the transaction to your unique account.</p>

<hr>

<p>To add, I would be highly surprised if you carried a major amount of money outside India in INR. This is not allowed as per the FEMA act and is clearly mentioned on the <a href=""http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FAQView.aspx?Id=53"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Reserve Bank of India Website FAQ</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Residents are free to take outside India (other than to Nepal and
  Bhutan) currency notes of Government of India and Reserve Bank of
  India notes up to an amount not exceeding Rs. 10,000 - per person.</p>

Carrying powder laundry detergent (or worse, liquid!) seems like a big hassle if standard hand/bar soap will do an adequate job.  If I go this route, are there any common clothing materials that won't stand up to this sort of washing over time?</p>
","<p>In the olden days you did do laundry with bar soap - but it was laundry bar soap - harsher and unscented. You can still get it in Mexico and probably lots of places.</p>

<p>I guess ""hand soap"" as it is (or was) usually called differs mainly by being <em>more expensive</em> and probably has ingredients to be less harsh on the skin, and it's usually scented.</p>

<p>Whether any of these extra ingredients is bad for fabrics I doubt but you never know. But being gentler on skin you can be pretty sure it's going to be gentler on stains also, so less effective on clothes.</p>

<p>So if the convenience of carrying fewer kinds of soap outweighs the higher price and lesser cleaning strength then sure - wash your clothes with hand soap while you're on the road. But now and then you probably want to wash it with laundry soap too.</p>

<p>(If you've ever tried washing your hands with laundry soap you will notice it can badly dry your skin. I made this mistake recently where the hostel bathroom didn't have hand soap but did have laundry powder. After a week or so the skin only on my hands was raspy and I realized my mistake.)</p>

I'd like to buy a prepaid SIM card for my phone, no calls or SMS needed - only data is sufficient. I've looked through French mobile operators and found nothing really acceptable. For example, in Finland I bought SIM card for €5 with 3GB of data. </p>

<p>So, the question is - what is the best SIM card for me, assuming that 1GB is enough (considering the prices) and that I am actually will be able to use it (I've read that some operators turn on mobile data only after 5 days which is unacceptable for me considering that I'll be there for 5 days only)?</p>
","<h2>Forfaits Bloqués Sans Engagement</h2>

<p>I am afraid France is a country where mobile internet is still <em>very</em> expensive. You could buy a standard prepaid SIM card and top it up with credit. You could then burn through this credit using internet data. Beware that rates are often somewhat expensive. SFR for example will charge you 0,50€/internet session, limited to 2MB (see the <em>Mentions Légales</em> on the <a href=""http://www.sfr.fr/telephonie-mobile/sfr-la-carte.html#sfrintid=B_mob_forfait-rc_voir-lca"" rel=""noreferrer"">SFR website</a>). </p>

<p>There are, however, what are called <em>forfaits bloqués</em> which are monthly rolling plans, some of which are <em>sans engagement</em> i.e. contractless, in the sense that there is no minimum subscription period you must pay for before cancelling the contract. If you look at the main carriers in France, which are also the only ones with physical shops where you can purchase SIM cards, you will find a common pattern: to get meaningful amounts of internet credit on one of these <em>forfaits sans engagement</em> you will have to pay between 15€ and 30€.

"Indian Railways-Online Reservation Rules","47784","","<p>I booked an online ticket for traveling on Indian Railways for a Short Distance Journey, but my ticket was not confirmed at all and is on the waiting list. </p>

<p>Can I travel with the waiting list ticket in the General Compartment?</p>
","<p>OK, great, now I can answer the question. General quota and general compartment are two completely different things. Quotas can be <code>general</code>, <code>foreign</code>, <code>women</code> etc. and that only refers to how many seats are reserved in certain quota. This is a useful in case you can't get a confirmed ticket in <code>general quota</code> because then you can try <code>foreign quota</code> or any other applicable one. Mind you, you can book other quotas only in person, at the counter.</p>

<p>General compartment on the other hand is one of the classes for traveling by train in India. It is also called <code>Unreserved 2nd sitting</code>. In that class you can travel no matter which ticket you have, be it a <code>General class ticket</code>, a <code>Sleeper class ticket</code> or even <code>1AC class ticket</code>. General class ticket is the cheapest one that you can get and doesn't fall into the limitations of general quota. If you have a ticket for your train, you can always go to general class. Sometimes this class is totally abandoned and you can sit, lay or do whatever you like but it is usually overcrowded without any space for you to move in. You may sit if you get there on time but as soon as you get up, you lose your seat. Riding in this class can be fun if you don't have too much luggage and if a route is not too long. I usually take general class for short (up to 4 hours) daytime rides.</p>

<p>Now, to answer your question - no, if you ticket doesn't get confirmed, you will not be able to ride in general class simply because you won't have a ticket since you get refunded for your ticket as soon as they're sure you are not getting confirmed. Don't despair though, you just buy a general class ticket before boarding your train and hope that there will be enough room for you on that train, you won't get anywhere by being polite, just push your way through to get on. Also, one other thing - TTE (Traveling Ticket Examiner) almost never checks the ticket in general class.</p>

<p>BTW, you might be able to get a <code>Tatkal quota ticket</code> for your trip. It is a last minute quota which is a bit more expensive but it might just get you on that train without the need for pushing and shoving in general compartment.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>To update my answer, I found that for popular places people just board the train with a waitlisted ticket in <code>Sleeper class</code> which gets them to their destination but is very annoying as they sit on your berths all the way and is kinda unfair since you paid the ticket price and don't get the ""comfort"" you deserve for your trip. But that's all India, I guess...</p>

"How to sleep in twins beds that are pushed together?","47320","","<p>My wife and I are going on holiday to a resort. While the resort markets the room as having a double bed, in reality it is two twin size beds pushed together with a narrow gap down the middle where they meet. We have stayed with this company before and the floor is tile, so as the night progresses, the narrow gap tends to widen. Apart from us staying on our own sides of the bed, is there anything we can do to make it more comfortable? Ideally, we would use the sheets and towels in the room, but we would be willing to buy and bring something if it will make the situation much better.</p>
","<p>Two other possible solutions.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There is a funny-looking <a href=""http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/store/product/instant-king-twin-bed-bridge/1012184352"">gadget</a> on sale in several places that can be used to fill the gap between the two joined beds. This makes things a bit more comfortable at the beginning of the process, but it works only until the gap becomes too large. Moreover, it doesn't look exactly travel-size.</p></li>
<li><p>You simply have to increase the friction between the bed legs and the floor. The easiest way is putting something sticky or rubbery below the legs. Be creative; you can use for instance <a href=""http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/products/50185143/"">silicone pot stands</a>, or even duct tape (is there anything it can't fix?).</p></li>

"USA to India (Delhi Airport): What and how many/much is allowed?","47303","","<p>I am going to India (Delhi) from USA (California) for the first time. When talking about how many items (electronics, jewelry, perfumes, watches etc) we can take in luggage bags and/or cabin bags there is always confusion. Some people say you can't take more than two phones or at most four electronic items. Some other mention different numbers. I was never terrified with numbers until I came to this situation. </p>

<p>Can anybody provide me with an official link stating the amount of items I can bring to India? Or any authentic resource where I can find the exact answer?</p>
","<p>There are two entirely separate things here:</p>

<ol>
<li>How much you are allowed to bring <strong>on the airplane</strong> (which is up to the airline), and</li>
<li>How much you can bring <strong>into India</strong> (which is up to Customs).</li>
</ol>

<p>The airline part is fairly straightforward: thanks to the magic of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baggage_allowance#Piece_Concept"" rel=""nofollow"">Piece Concept</a>, for all international flights starting or ending from the US, you are allowed to bring 2 pieces of checked-in luggage of up to 23 kg each per person, total 46 kg, plus 1 item of carry-on luggage of up 7 kg (usually) per person, plus a ""personal item"" (handbag, laptop, etc).  So that's a grand total of <strong>53 kg per person</strong>.</p>

<p>The airline does not care <em>what</em> you pack, as long as it is not hazardous.  Also, unless you buy extra insurance, per the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Convention"" rel=""nofollow"">Montreal Convention</a> they will only pay you an absolute maximum of 1131 SDR (around US$1600 at time of writing) if they lose or destroy your bags by accident.</p>

<p>Then there is the complicated part, which is Indian Customs.  Customs &amp; Central Excise publish a ""<a href=""http://www.cbec.gov.in/trvler-guide_ason22may2013.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Baggage Rules at a Glance</a>"" guide for travellers, which is 20 pages long (!), but here are some of the main points for a returning resident who has been away from India for more than three days:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unlimited amount of ""used personal effects required for satisfying the necessities of life"" (basically clothing, toiletries etc, but not eg. electronics)</li>
<li>Up to Rs. 35,000 duty-free per person</li>
<li>Additional limits for tobacco, alcohol, gold, silver</li>
<li>One laptop in addition is allowed</li>
<li>Up to US$5000 (or equivalent) in cash</li>
</ul>

<p>All limits are per person and cannot be pooled (eg. two people can't bring back a Rs. 70,000 item for free).  If you're a ""professional"" returning to India after at least three months working abroad, you get extra allowances for household goods and professional equipment; there's also an entirely different set of rules for visiting tourists.</p>

<p>All that said, Customs are a <a href=""http://www.nobribe.org/customs-corruption-creek#more-381"" rel=""nofollow"">notoriously corrupt bunch</a> and there are quite a few greedy sadists who appear to enjoy using real or imagined infractions of the rules to extract bribes or liberate people from their belongings.  As ever, it's the poor manual labourers returning from years of toil in the Gulf who seem to get the brunt of this though, and they'll back off if you're confident and make it clear you know the rules (a copy of the official guide above won't hurt!).</p>

"Is it dangerous to drive through Death Valley?","47277","","<p>I planned to drive through <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Valley"">Death Valley</a> with a rental car during end of May or beginning of June. Now a friend of mine told me that this is a little bit dangerous, and that a lot of rental companies as well as other organization advise against driving through the Death Valley.</p>

<p>Furthermore, he said that it is dangerous because you can't use the air condition in your car because it is too hot and if your car breaks down, you could get into real problem.</p>

<p>So my question is: How dangerous is it really to drive trough the Death Valley, and what precautions should I take as a tourist (who has no clue about cars)?</p>
","<p>I think Death Valley is not more dangerous than other landscapes with some precautions, so some advices with addition from the <a href=""http://www.nps.gov/deva/planyourvisit/yoursafety.htm"">offical link</a></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Drive carefully. The monotonous landscape can easily lull you into being unresponsive and
the lack of visual cues means that you are in danger to drive much too fast without
recognizing it. This leads to sudden crashes or collisions (!) because you (or the other
driver) did not anticipate it.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Plenty</em> of water. This may seem exaggerated, but on desert tours I store 50 liters
(12 gallons) in my car if I am alone and if there are more persons 20 liters per person.
People constantly underestimate the amount of water they will use in the desert.
Drink in sips (a cup every half an hour), not plenty, because the last one
one causes you to sweat more. In the best case (under shadows, not working) people will
still use 2 liters per day. In the worst case (working under the sun) you will lose more
than 20 (!) liters per day.</p></li>
<li><p>Buy a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarpaulin"">tarp</a>. Your car will heat up to incredible temperatures during the sun without air condition. So if your car breaks down, you can build up your tarp next to your car to protect you from sunlight and give you some shadow. Do not forget your sunglasses and sun lotion.</p></li>
<li><p>DO NOT LEAVE THE VICINITY OF YOUR CAR ASIDE FROM THE STREET. A car is widely visible from above and will attract attention while a human body is nearly completely invisible.</p></li>
<li><p>Be aware that cell phones may not function. So take a map with you and perhaps a GPS device to know where you are and what your next station is. Book your accommodation before and tell them when you expect to arrive so people know if you are missing.</p></li>
</ul>

What about the previous day? I need the car for about 30 hours -- can I book it for 48 hours and return it at the most convenient time? (I'm booking at CarDelMar through billiger-mietwagen.de)</p>
","<p>You can return a rental car early, but whether you get any refund, or even get penalized for the early return, depends on the terms and conditions spelled out in your particular rental agreement.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>By returning early, you may forfeit certain discounts. For example, a rental car agency may be willing to give you a weekly rate for a five-day rental, but switch to the daily rate for a four-day rental. By returning the car early, the rental car agency may further claim that your original contract has been violated, allowing them to charge a higher rate, but that will not be true for every company or for every jurisdiction.</p></li>
<li><p>Some agencies may charge an <strong>early return fee</strong> for postpaid hires. Alamo is well-known for charging $15 for early returns, and there are many anecdotes of agency absurdities like <a href=""http://abc7news.com/archive/7892726/"">Budget charging $11.80</a> for returning a car 10 minutes early. The reason for the charge, as <a href=""https://www.hertz.com/rentacar/reservation/reviewmodifycancel/templates/rentalTerms.jsp?KEYWORD=CANCELLATION&amp;EOAG=SXFT53"">Hertz puts it</a> is   </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>to compensate us in part for our inability to rent your vehicle during the
  time reserved for your use.</p>

<li><p>On prepaid rentals, again, whether or not you receive any refund for the time remaining depends on your agreement. <a href=""https://www.budget.com/budgetWeb/html/en/deals/prepaybeatscompetition.html"">Budget advertises</a> that they will recalculate charges based on the actual time rented, while their competitors Hertz and Alamo do not— but see above for other shadiness from Budget.</p></li>

<p>When they ask for an itinerary, what documents need to be shown? Is it enough to have a plan of which places I am going to visit and where I will be staying?</p>
","<p>The point of it is to show that you've got a plan and know how much it's going to cost you etc.  They want to know WHY you're going.  They already know how (train/plane) but want the details.</p>

<p>SO if you can show that you're headed to France for 3 weeks to check out war memorials, before crossing to Amsterdam for some fun and out through Munich for Octoberfest, and have hostel bookings and the like, it shows that you've thought about it and have some idea of what you're doing, where you're going and maybe how you're going to survive (accommodation etc).</p>

<p>For example, <a href=""http://ambafrance-uk.org/Short-stay-visa"">some sites</a> will suggest that you put together a travel plan.  This could consist of the itinerary of your tour (if you're doing one), or otherwise - your accommodation, health insurance.

"What is the minimum time to consider with a connecting flight in the USA?","46626","","<p>Given the extensive time taken for immigration formalities in the US, what is the shortest time to consider between connecting flights in the US, when coming from abroad?</p>

<p>Until now I have always entered the US at my destination. This is not always the cheapest option. I was told that 3 hours is the advised time to go through immigration and boarding of a connecting flight. Online booking sites still offer connecting flights, with a transfer times sometimes even less then 1 hour. </p>
","<p>There is an official ""minimum connecting time"" for each airport. For international airports, there are usually separate ""minimum connecting times"" specified for domestic to domestic, domestic to international, international to domestic, and international to international. At larger airports there may even be longer minimum connecting times when you are changing airlines.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, the data is not readily available online. Here are some places to find an official minimum connecting time, sorted in order from most authoritative to least authoritative:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The official source is the IATA, which publishes the Airline Coding Directory, which costs hundreds of dollars. </p></li>
<li><p>A much cheaper way to get the same data is to get the <a href=""http://www.oagtravel.com/Products-Services/Print/OAG-Pocket-Flight-Guide"">Official Airline Guide</a>. Since minimum connecting times don't change very often, I recommend just buying one copy of an outdated OAG Pocket Flight Guide on ebay for a couple of bucks.</p></li>
<li><p>Call any airline involved in your itinerary. Tell them you would like to know the minimum connecting time for the airport in question. They'll know exactly what you're talking about and look it up for you.</p></li>
<li><p>Airlines sometimes publish minimum connecting times on their websites or in their timetables, usually only useful when you are connecting on the same airline. But if you are connecting on the same airline, you don't have to worry about this, because they will not book you on a connection which is shorter than the minimum connecting time.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Remember that minimum connecting times are only estimates. Your first flight might be late. US Immigration may be overloaded. The airport train may break down. The security check in for the second flight may be really long.</p>

<p>Due to all the steps involved, <strong>international to domestic transfers are always terrible and should be avoided if at all possible.</strong> You are literally better off transferring through a third country that has good international->international connections (Vancouver, Amsterdam, and London Heathrow Terminal 5 are all great for international to international) if that allows you to enter the US at your final destination.</p>

<p>So for example if you're travelling from Europe to Detroit, you're WAY better off changing planes in Amsterdam than at JFK. If you're travelling from Seoul to San Diego, you're WAY better off changing in Vancouver than SFO or LAX. Etc.</p>

<p>Like everything, ""IT DEPENDS,"" so please feel free to ask a more specific question -- at the very least we need to know what airport you're connecting at and which airlines you're using.</p>

"Leaving Schengen region to reset 90 days","46585","","<p>I have a friend who claims that you can leave the Schengen area for 1 night, and re-enter, to reset your 90 days.  For example, an Australian could enter Europe and then go for a couple of nights holiday to Morocco, Andorra, or London (any place outside of Schengen), and then return to Paris and have the passport stamped for another 90 days stay in Europe.  They swear by this and claim they know guys doing it for years.  My understanding, which admittedly is just from reading online and not real-world experience, was that we could only spend 90 days out of any 180 days in the Schengen region.  </p>

<p>I've also heard other people say, no, you can't do that and if you are caught overstaying then you can be banned from re-entering schengen region for 5 years.  But, I've heard similar stories from several other people about leaving for 1 night making me think there is something to this story even if it's a loophole or a legal grey area (e.g. maybe the person checking at the border when you re-enter has to actually notice a previous stamp in your passport?)</p>

<p>So what are the real rules and facts about tourists staying in the Schengen region on these visa waiver agreements?</p>
","<p>This explained reasonably well in the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Area#Entry_conditions_for_third-country_nationals"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia article</a>. You can stay in the Schengen area for up to 90 days in a 180-day period either with a short-stay visa or with a visa waiver depending on your nationality. Beyond that, you need a long-stay visa.</p>

<p>There's a twist: 180-day periods are counted from the date of your first entry to Schengen, thus repeating every 6 months. So if you arrive in Schengen on January 1 and leave on March 30, you can't reenter until July 1. But if you spend one day on January 1, then come back on April 2nd, you can leave on June 30 and come back on July 1 to stay until September 30. In a sense, you can make a visa run, but only if it's exactly the right number of days since your first Schengen entry.</p>

<p>More precisely, the rule is Article 11 of the <a href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:42000A0922%2802%29%3aEN%3aHTML"" rel=""nofollow"">Schengen Convention</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The visa provided for in Article 10 may be:<br>
  (a) a travel visa valid for one or more entries, provided that neither the length of a continuous visit nor the total length of successive visits exceeds three months in any half-year, from the date of first entry;<br>
  (b) a transit visa authorising its holder to pass through the territories of the Contracting Parties once, twice or exceptionally several times en route to the territory of a third State, provided that no transit shall exceed five days.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Article 10 introduces the mutually-recognized Schengen short-stay visa, which can be valid for up to three months.</p>

<p>Thus the answer is no: you cannot make a visa run for Schengen. Your passport will be stamped and your name will be entered in a database, so if you try you run a good chance of being detected. You might get lucky, but you might also get fined and barred from entering the Schengen area for several years.</p>

","<p>There is a EUR 430 allowance but it's <a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/common/travellers/enter_eu/index_en.htm"">explicitly for goods “having no commercial character”</a>.

Incidentally, even a single brand new Apple Mac Book for your own use would not be OK either because it would be over the limit (bringing back your own <em>used</em> laptop is a different question).</p>

<p>It was a long time ago (before the EU rules detailed in the link above) but someone from my family once got in trouble for a handful of baby napkins or something like that. The issue is not merely the value but the fact that having several identical items, especially with receipts or intact packaging is taken as a sign that the goods are new and you might want to sell them instead of carrying them for your personal use.</p>

<p>Under this logic, the answer to the title question would therefore appear to be “one” even if there is no explicit limit. A suitcase full of identical laptops is certainly likely to attract attention.</p>

<p>Then we look at Airbus.  Their fastest, we're looking at the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A380"">A380</a>.  Its cruising speed is said to be Mach 0.85, while its top speed was shown in a demonstration in 2005 to be Mach 0.96.  Even closer!</p>

<p>So with conventional passenger jets, no, we can't go faster than the speed of sound, and Mach 0.96 is the theoretical maximum you'll reach, although it's unlikely you'll be on a flight doing that (they did it with a shallow dive and without passengers/cargo).</p>

<p>Part of the reason for this is design - the entire design of the plane needs to change if one is to break the sound barrier - the pressure and forces exerted on the aircraft would likely see them break apart.  Another is the noise pollution - there's a very large sonic boom when the Concorde used to break the barrier.</p>

<p>HOWEVER, you can 'cheat'.  If you're in say, a 777 going fast with a massive tail-wind, your effective groundspeed could be faster than it, even though the plane isn't reaching the same pressures.  There's a <a href=""http://www.askcaptainlim.com/flying-on-the-boeing-777-flying-91/1052-a-boeing-777-cant-fly-this-fast.html"">detailed discussion of when this has happened online</a>.</p>

"How to independently visit Saudi Arabia?","45114","","<p>I've read that Saudi Arabia doesn't grant tourist visas to independent travelers. I've also read that recently they grant visas to group of travelers, if the tour is organized by a recognized tour company.</p>

<p>The question is: what are (if any) <em>legal</em> means to independently visit Saudi Arabia? </p>
","<p>Yes, visiting Saudi Arabia is probably <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/a/5812/1893"">more difficult than anywhere else in the world</a>, but it's not impossible by any means.</p>

<p>First up, if you're a citizen of a Gulf Cooperation Council country, the answer is easy: you don't need a visa to travel to Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>If you're not, you have four (well, three) choices.</p>

<ul>
<li>Actual <strong>tourism</strong> visas have been suspended for time being, even for group travel.  They'll probably change their mind again at some point again, so might as well keep an eye out.</li>
<li><strong>Business</strong> visas are available if you can find a company in the Kingdom to sponsor you for one and pay the rather stiff application fees.  Once you're in, you're in and the Kingdom is your oyster, except for the Muslim-only zones of Mecca and Madinah.  Contrary to popular belief, business visitors do <em>not</em> need an exit visa, that only applies for long-term work visas.  And if your <em>wastah</em> (connections) are strong enough, anything is possible: I've met single women and Jews in the Kingdom on these visas.</li>
<li><strong>Transit</strong> visas are available if you have a legitimate reason to pass through the Kingdom on your way to somewhere else.  Booking a Saudia flight with a layover of over 18 hours is one option, driving a car through Saudi from eg. Bahrain or the UAE to Jordan is another.  Plenty of stories on the net about this, <a href=""http://upgrd.com/matthew/how-to-obtain-a-saudi-arabian-transit-visa.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here's one</a> documented in extreme detail.</li>
<li>Last and least, there's one foolproof way to visit the Kingdom: book a Saudia flight with a layover of under 18 hours, in which case <strong>you don't need a visa</strong>.  Only problem is, you'll also be stuck airside at either Jeddah, Riyadh or Dammam airport, which I can tell you from personal experience are all excruciatingly boring. (Survival tip: Mooch free wifi from the unsecured network at the al-Fursan lounge.)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're Muslim and male, you have two extra choices:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <strong>Hajj</strong> visa, available for visiting Mecca and Medinah only during the month of Hajj.  Visas are allocated by a lottery system based on the population of Muslims in each country and are generally quite hard to get.  <a href=""http://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Hajj"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikivoyage</a> has some more details.</li>
<li>An <strong>Umrah</strong> visa for visiting Mecca and Medinah outside the pilgrimage month.  Saudi Arabia has <a href=""http://www.thewestsidestory.net/2013/05/15/saudi-arabia-to-issue-new-tourist-visas/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">recently announced</a> an ""Umrah-plus"" visa that would also allow travel outside the holy sites, details on this are still scarce at the moment.</li>
</ul>

<p>Neither option is available to women, who must be accompanied by a <em>mahram</em> (male guardian) or, if over 45, travel in a group.</p>

<p>And a personal note: I spent around half a year in Saudi Arabia on business, and from a visitor's point of view, it's not as bad as reading some of the clueless drivel on the net makes it sound.  If <a href=""http://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia#Respect"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">you use common sense, respect local custom and don't do anything blatantly stupid</a>, you'll be fine.  Now, for some of its inhabitants Saudi is considerably worse than you'd think (for example, I was astonished by the number of destitute beggars on Riyadh's streets), but that's another story.</p>

"What do ""Fragile"" stickers on checked baggage do?","44977","","<p>When traveling by air and checking bags, some airlines will let you declare an item as fragile and put stickers on the box or bag. How common is this policy? What do the fragile stickers do (i.e. how do they change the baggage handling process)? Is this generally recommended when traveling with fragile luggage (to avoid items being damaged in transit) or discouraged (because it may make an item a bigger target for theft)?</p>
","<p>Think about what your luggage goes through from the time you check it until you get it back.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>It travels on automatic conveyor belts.</strong> In many situations, it must be shunted from one conveyor belt to another. This is done by machines, not humans. The machines cannot see the ""fragile"" tag.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It is moved from conveyor-belt to dolly by a human.</strong> The human may, or may not, notice the ""fragile"" tag.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It is packed in the cargo hold by humans.</strong> Depending on the orientation of the item, the human may, or may not, notice the ""fragile"" tag. When they pack it in the cargo hold, they may put other bags on top of it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It spends some time outside, exposed to the elements.</strong> No matter how many fragile tags you put on, there will come a point where your suitcase must make its way up the conveyor belt into the aircraft. If it is raining, snowing, cold, or hot, it will be exposed to the elements at this point.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It spills out of an automatic conveyor line onto a rotating baggage carousel.</strong> As it rotates on the carousel, other bags may fall on top of it. Other passengers may pick it up, thinking it's their bag, and handle it. When they discover it's not theirs, they may, or may not, honor the ""Fragile"" sticker.</p>

<p><em>Oh, and let's not forget:</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>It flies through the air, at 40,000 feet, at 600 miles per hour.</strong> It may encounter bad weather or turbulence, causing intensive shaking of the contents for a prolonged period of time.</p></li>

"Do all American ATMs charge an extra fee for cash withdrawals on a foreign card?","44809","","<p>I've just gone to take some cash out of an ATM (Cash Machine) in Seattle. I visited about half a dozen in the end, and every single one wanted to charge me an extra fee (typically about $3) for the cash withdrawl on my (non-US) card. This was at bank ATMs in the centre of town, at their branches, rather than in a supermarket or somewhere.</p>

<p>In the end I had to give up and let one of them charge me (I needed cash!), but it was both unexpected and rather annoying. Having gone to the trouble of getting a card that wasn't going to charge me lots to use it abroad, I'm instead hit with fees from the owner of the cash machine.</p>

<p>Was I really unlucky to only find ATMs that wanted to charge me as a foreign user, or do all American ATMs do that? And if only some do, what banks should I be trying to find to avoid being hit with the fee?</p>
","<ol>
<li><p>Try a credit union. Many of them boast surcharge-free ATMs. Lots of smaller banks don't collect surcharges either. Those that don't often will have a big sign saying so near the ATM.  The Credit Union National Association, the Independent Community Bankers Association and The Co-Op Network all have ATM locators on their Web sites.  </p></li>
<li><p>Ask for cash-back when you use your ATM card at a grocery store. This service is free at many stores.</p></li>

"Should I change most of my money in my home country or in the destination country? baht to canadian dollars....change in thailand or canada","44569","","<p>Where can I get more favourable exchange rate, in general?changing baht to Canadian dollars in Thailand or Canada or make a bank transfer to my Canadian account</p>
","<p>This varies very much depending on your country of origin and your destination.
Best exchange rate mean lowest <a href=""http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid-askspread.asp"">spread</a>, but keep in mind, that some banks apart of the spread, also charge extra commissions. </p>

<p>Keeping that in mind, there are some general tendencies. Exchange rates, from best, to worst:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>electronic transactions</strong> (i.e. transactions made directly with the credit card). These usually have the lowest spread (or none at all for major currencies) and typically using major credit cards there is no extra commission. This is the preferred option when you're traveling in developed countries. </li>
<li><strong>cash withdrawal</strong> (usually ATM, note however, that on rare occasions when paying with card, it'll be actually charged as cash withdrawal). This usually has decent spread, some banks charge commissions, some don't. Your Mileage May Vary. Check availability of ATMs accepting your cards beforehand. In some exotic countries you'll only get them at main airport. (btw. some banks/ATM operators charge fixed or minimum fee per transaction, so it's better to make one bigger withdrawal, than a number of smaller ones). </li>
<li><strong>money exchange at your bank</strong>, i.e. withdrawing money from your account in other currency. Problem with that is, that it's impractical to carry around large quantities of cash when you're traveling. </li>
<li><strong>local money exchange</strong>, least favorable, but in really exotic countries that might be your only option. Especially when you're in situation, that you've run out of local currency and you're not anywhere close to civilization. </li>
</ul>

<p>The exception are countries, where the money is not fully and freely interchangeable. In that case most often black-market exchange will give you much more than the official ones at banks. However, using black-market you're exposing yourself to fraud. </p>

"Car rental vs. buying a car for 1 month, when visiting the USA?","44508","","<p>I would like to visit a few places in the states sometime next year, and I was thinking of doing a road trip while I'm at it. I could start in either Los Angeles or Montreal, and then I would like to visit Philadelphia, Phoenix and Las Vegas during my trip; plus whatever there is on the way between - national parks would be on top of the list. I had about $2000 in mind for transport (excluding fuel).</p>

<p>So my question is: how would I get around? I could take the trains or public transport between the States and Montreal because I don't want to have any hassle with importing/exporting a car, and only drive a car in the states. </p>

<p>The 2 options I see here are either buying a used car and then sell it at the end of the trip, or rent a car. </p>

<p>I had a look at hertz.com, and they quoted me ~$3500 (including insurance) for 1 month and this car:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/01dmk.jpg"" alt=""look mate, the orange car goes much faster!""></p>

<p>But it seems like I have to return the car to the pickup location with Hertz, because if I choose a different drop off location it shows ""not available"" for this car. Did I just pick the wrong drop off location here of is A->B really not an option? Do I get different rates at different locations? Has anyone advice on how to get this cheaper? I searched for ""relocation"" on their site, but didn't find anything.</p>

<p>The second option would be to buy a car for $3000, and then sell it at the end of my trip, and hopefully get more than $1000 back for it. Has anyone experience with this? Are there any places better for buying or for selling a car? In which state would I get ""more car"" for the same amount of money? Would there be any paperwork involved if I buy a car in one state and sell it in another? Anything else I need to know when buying or selling a car?</p>
","<p><strong>Buying option</strong></p>

<p>For a one-month trip, I do not recommend buying and selling a car.  Although it probably could be done, let me address some of the complications with that first, then I'll discuss rentals:</p>

<ul>
<li>A $3000 car will be old, and probably not very reliable. I would not trust a car in this price range to get me safely around the country without thorough inspection, or a long test-drive/break-in period first.  Certainly you could get lucky, and have absolutely no problems with a $3000 car for a month of road trips.  But it would really ruin your vacation, I expect, if the car broke down in the middle of Arizona, or wherever.</li>
<li>Selling a car takes time.  If you're willing to lose $2000 in the selling process, though, it would be easy.  You could probably unload it at any car dealership for $2000 less than you paid a month before.</li>
<li>Registration is a pain.  Typically when you buy a car, you will get a temporary tag, and then have 30 days (although in some states fewer, I believe) to get an official registration.  If your stay is 30 days or less, this may not be a problem, since you would not be required to get an official tag.  But if you have the car 31 days or longer, you'll have to stop by a DMV (Department of Motor Vehicles) in some state, and get a license plate.  And doing that typically requires proof of residence of that state, which you probably won't have.  It will likely also require a vehicle inspection, at minimum to ensure the car is not stolen, and in many states, to ensure it passes environmental regulations.  If you register the car in the same state where you buy it, it will probably pass environmental regulations.  But if you register it in another state, it's anybody's guess.</li>
<li>It may be difficult to find a company that will provide you (affordable) insurance for a car you just bought, if you are not a U.S. resident.</li>
<li>Depending on the states where you buy and sell your car, it may actually be impossible to sell your car so quickly after having bought it, because you may not have the title in your possession yet.  And even if you have a title signed over to you, that may not be sufficient to sell it--you may have to get the state DMV (wherever you register the vehicle) to send you a new official title in your name before you can sell it again.</li>
<li>Selling the car in another state may be difficult, but I don't know. If you sell it to a dealership, they will likely take over most of the paper work involved--assuming it's possible.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Rental option</strong></p>

<p>There are much cheaper options for rentals than the one you quoted.  A quick look at <a href=""http://www.kayak.com/"">kayak.com</a> shows that a rental from LAX (Los Angeles, CA) and drop-off at LGA (New York City, NY) a month later can be had for as little as $1792 including tax. Of course that does not include fuel, and likely does not include extra insurance.  You also may or may not be able to take this vehicle into Canada.  Different rental agencies will have different policies (and possibly extra costs) for taking it into Canada.  You'll just have to ask.</p>

<p>This rental option may take you over your $2000 budget, but you might be able to cut corners by renting multiple vehicles at different times during your stay.  If you'll be staying in L.A. for a week, for instance, maybe use public transport while you're there, and only rent a car at the end of your stay for the next leg of your journey. </p>

<p>You can also count on a more reliable car. If you pick a nation-wide rental company, they might change your car along the way in agencies and you have customer support if you have any mechanic problem. You also drive a quite recent car.</p>

"What food to take on a 3-4 day long hiking trip?","44423","","<p>It should be easy to prepare, light and shouldn't go bad after few days in the heat. How much would it approximately weight? Lets say there won't be any grocery stores along the way (there will be, but I want to get used to this, so we can travel in more desolate places in the future).</p>

<p>EDIT: We were hiking before, but the food we took was not optimal (heavy, lots of snack bars) and we went to grocery stores along the way. The trip is in an area with low hills, water is not a problem. The answers do not need to be specific for this trip, just a general list of foods that are a good choice for hiking.</p>
","<p>A lot of what you need you can just get in the grocery store - <strong>rice, pasta, dried potatoes</strong> (either mashed or slices for ""au gratin), <strong>sausage</strong> like pepperoni and salami that specifically doesn't need refrigeration, <strong>dried fruit and nuts</strong>, instant hot <strong>cereal</strong> (oatmeal, cream of wheat etc), <strong>dried legumes</strong> (especially lentils which don't need soaking) <strong>jam, honey, and peanut butter</strong> will take care of a lot of your needs. You'll want to put things into different packaging so they can survive in your pack and so that you're taking the right amount for the length of the trip.</p>

<p>My favourite camping breakfast is <strong>instant oatmeal</strong>. Add extra raisins, brown sugar, or other dried fruits if you like. Boil water in the morning and you have coffee and oatmeal and you are set for a pretty physical day. (Bring a whisperweight stove that uses butane or liquid fuel - fires are far too slow for morning purposes.) <strong>Beef jerky</strong> (made at home if you have a dehydrator, or bought in the store if you don't) along with dried fruit and nuts will meet any snack needs through the day. If you must have lunch, you can use <strong>bagels or English muffins</strong> (on week+ trips I <a href=""http://www.gregcons.com/canoe/muffins.htm"">make my own</a> english muffins, your trip is short so just bring a few packages) with <strong>cheese</strong> (the ""light"" cheeses keep better, and buy several small ones so they stay sealed longer than one big one), sausage (the no-refrigeration needed ones), peanut butter, jam, or honey. If one of your days features a big climb to a gorgeous lookout and you know you'll want a rest, packages of soup mix from the grocery store can make a 30 minute stop into a delightful lunch. Again the whisperlight stove and some locally-sourced water.</p>

<p>Dinner the first night can be meat you took from your freezer that morning, wrapped in plastic and several layers of newspaper. I've done it and when we unrwap it, it's not just cold, it still has ice crystals in the middle. Fry it, and cook some fresh veg with it as you would at home. The second night try <a href=""http://www.gregcons.com/canoe/pizza.htm"">pizza in a frying pan</a> using that no-refrigeration pepperoni, some cheese, and maybe some onions and any other veg you've brought. The third night, something vegetarian built around lentils and rice - we love kusherie - or beans in a sauce, like meatless spicy chili with dumplings. You can also dry hamburger meat (cooked) in your oven at home and use that as the meat in spaghetti sauce or shepherds pie filling. Set the hot pan of cooked sauce aside with a towel around it while you cook the starch - it will stay plenty warm and you only need the one little stove. These need you to bring canned or dried veg, I choose dried for the weight and rehydrate them right in the sauce or stew.</p>

<p>Bottom line is this is way easier than you think. Have a great time!</p>

"What happens if you lose your passport at an airport / during transit?","43445","","<p>Once, when flying from India to the UK, I left my passport on the plane's seat-back pocket and forgot that I left it there until I reached the passport control desks. Fortunately in this case, I rushed back to the gate where the plane had parked and since the plane was being cleaned there, I was able to request the staff to fetch my passport for me from my seat.</p>

<p>My question is: <strong>what happens if you lose your passport during transit at an airport, or before you reach the passport control desk at your destination country?</strong> I know that in any other situation, I would be able to contact my country's embassy to get an emergency travel document (ETD). What happens in this other case - can you get an ETD at the airport, or will you be deported back to the country you flew from? And in case of a deportation, are you sent back to your home country or the origin country of your previous flight? I want to know if there are any international laws covering this scenario.</p>

<p>(This is all under the assumption that you have the relevant visas or travel authorisation for your destination, but they're obviously in your passport.)</p>
","<p>As Andra said in his answer, there is no general rule here. Anyway out of personal experiences as an airline staff for years I have seen this pattern:</p>

<p><strong>Arriving at a foreign country, departing from home:</strong></p>

<p>Most likely you will be deported back in the same airplane. There are cases where authorities will allow you if you have a valid ID or you have managed to get an emergency travel document from your embassy, but that's if you are lucky enough or your embassy is really helpful.</p>

<p><strong>Arriving home, departing from a foreign country:</strong></p>

<p>You will be able to enter.</p>

<p><strong>Arriving at a foreign country, departing from a foreign country:</strong></p>

<p>This is a problem, most likely you will not be allowed to enter, and if you are to be deported in the same plane then you will face the same problem when you arrive back! If you can afford to buy a ticket to your home country on the spot, you will be put on the first plane to your home.</p>

<p>Anyway, arranging an emergency travel document will solve your problem, but again this is not as easy as it seems always.</p>

<p>The same thing goes for the transit passengers as long as they will pass the passport control and eventually they will reach a destination without a passport and face the same.</p>

<p>In any of the above cases you will definitely have lots of questions from the immigration/customs. Finally, Always remember, there are exceptions to every rule.</p>

I was never arrested, or had any trouble with the law, I was never deported. I paid my taxed (had a TFN) had a job, bank account bought a house, etc. About 9 years ago I decided to leave as I was tired of living like that, not able to be legal, in fear of deportation and loosing everything.

We never returned our I-94s and in 2005 left through Mexico (walked through the border) so there are no records of us ever leaving. We have lived here in Australia for over 9 years.</p>

<p>OK so my question is... We have been thinking we would like to visit our friends and family back in the US now that we have a little girl. Is there any chance they won't let us in because they know we overstayed? We would be travelling with our Australian passports. </p>

"How to get to Patagonia from Buenos Aires?","43019","","<p>I'm heading to Buenos Aires in a week and would like to get to Patagonia and back in 12 days.</p>

<p>I assume I've got to get down to El Calafate and from there we can organize trekking and visit the Perito Moreno glacier.</p>

<p>I'm on a budget, and it seems like flying and taking the bus is going to be around the same price, and both are pretty expensive ($200/person round trip). Would there be an advantage to taking the bus besides getting there quicker? (Nice scenery I'd miss from a plane maybe?)</p>
","<p>Well firstly most buses won't go directly to El Calafate.  You'll likely have to change buses, and likely will want to - it's a long way!</p>

<p>However, a convenient stopping point could be Puerto Madryn (Chubut).  It's a great little beach town, with the Valdez Peninsula - and I kid you not - you can sit on the hostel balcony and point at the whales as they come near the shore!  Some great seafood restaurants too.</p>

<p>If you're going to consider the bus, consider upgrading from Semi-cama to full-cama or cama-suite or whatever the bus company you choose calls it.  Semi-cama is seats that partially recline.  However for about $5 more from Puerto Madryn to Buenos Aires (that's the price difference  it was for me) you can upgrade to full-cama, which gives you a seat that folds down into a BED, as well as good food, and tv.  If you're on a strict budget don't bother, but once I discovered that, wow, it's so much better for the huge trips.</p>

<p>In El Calafate, I also highly recommend the America Del Sur Hostel - it had a spectacular view over the town and Lago Argentina, and you can organise trips to the glacier from their reception (we did a day tour to the glacier - it's spectacular).</p>

<p>Much of the flat part of Argentina is fairly boring scenery, but I liked the coastal route, and once you get into the mountains it's great.  You'll spot guanacoes (like llamas) and rhea (like ostrich) and other animals.  But I guess it depends on your preference, how you handle seriously-long bus trips, and how much time you have as well.</p>

<p>Look into Andesmar (my favourite), El Rapido (sometimes cheaper), Omnilineas and Plusmar.  </p>

<p>I'm mostly interested in travel time &amp; general smoothness of the trip (e.g. buying just one ticket for the whole trip would be nice). Price is a secondary concern. </p>
","<p>The most straightforward way would be taking the <a href=""http://www.gatwickexpress.com/"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>Gatwick Express</strong></a> to Victoria Station (the journey is about 30 mins). The Gatwick Station is directly connected to the South Terminal. From the North Terminal it's a bit further and you need to take the automated shuttle train. 
Trains leave every 15 minutes. </p>

<p>From Victoria Station you have no less than three options: </p>

<ul>
<li>take the underground/tube/metro/whatever-you-call-it <strong>Circle Line</strong>
(High Street Kensington direction) and get out at Paddington stop.
It's gonna take about 20 minutes.</li>
<li>Accordingly to Gagravarr's comment you could also go from <strong>Victoria Line</strong> to Oxford Circus, then a cross-platform change to the <strong>Bakerloo Line</strong> up to
Paddington.</li>
<li>If the metro is closed, take the bus 436 to Paddington.</li>
</ul>

<p>For all those options, make sure you use the exit at the front of the train, not the exit on the upper floor through the elevators or escalators.</p>

<p>You could also take a taxi, if the price isn't a concern for you.</p>

<p>There are other possibilities I left out because they won't be faster or more straightforward than this.</p>

<p>Note: be aware of the fact that, <a href=""http://www.gatwickexpress.com/en/your-journey/timetable/improvement-works/"" rel=""nofollow"">from time to time, especially during weekends/holidays, Gatwick Express has to make alterations to train services, usually for planned Improvement works.</a> </p>

<li>Suppose I am a naturalized citizen of the US, but also a citizen of another country, ""XYZ"".</li>
<li>I then boarded a plane and left the US to another country (maybe not necessarily to XYZ), without first getting a US passport, but using my old, but valid XYZ passport.</li>

<p>Would I need to contact the US Embassy for help in order to be able return?</p>

<p>If the airline does let me aboard to return to the US, with the US passport, what are the best documents could I show at the border to prove I am a US citizen but that I just don't have a passport, for whatever reason?</p>
","<p>As a US citizen you can not be denied entry to the US once you are on US soil, with or without a passport.  Other than a passport there is no set list of documents required, however you will need to be able to convince the immigration officials that you are a US citizen and/or prove your identity so documents such as a Birth Certificate, Green Card, Drivers License, etc will all be helpful.  If you follow this path you WILL be taken to secondary screening, and you can expect the process to take at least 1-2 hours longer than normal.</p>

<p>However your initial problem is going to be making it to US soil.  Without a US passport the airline will not let you board your flight to the US unless you have suitable entry documents, which means that you'll need either a Visa or an ESTA (if your other passport is from a country that is a part of the US Visa Waiver Program).</p>

<p>If entering under the VWP, or most types of Visas, then you will also need to hold an onward/return air ticket as proof that you will be leaving the US at the end of your trip. Obviously once you arrive and enter the US as a citizen this will not be required, but without it it's highly likely that the airline will refuse boarding without it.</p>

<p>Also be aware that as a US citizen you MUST enter the US as a citizen.  ie, even if you have obtained a ESTA and a return ticket, you can not legally use your foreign passport to pass through US immigration. These will be required to allow the airline to carry you to the US, but must NOT be actually used to enter the country.</p>

<p>In general, your best option is going to be to contact the local US Consulate and obtain a US Passport.  This will save you a lot of trouble not only before your trip, but also when you actually arrive in the US.</p>

<p>If you intend to leave the US again in the future you will also need a US passport for that - it is illegal for a US citizen to leave the US using a non-US passport.</p>

"How to convince airport security that I am not dangerous when having metallic parts in my body?","41800","","<p>I had an operation some time ago and now I have small screws in my shoulder which will not be removed anymore. When I decided to fly for vacation, I supposed that these will may bring me into trouble at the airport when going through the metal detector.</p>

<p>So I asked my doctor and at the hospital if there is any kind of ""passport"" or something similar which confirms the screws in my shoulder so that I do not get into many problems. Unfortunately, they told me such things do only exist if you get a new knee or something, not if you just have a few screws in your body.</p>

<p>When I flew from Vienna to Amsterdam and back, my fears were confirmed: The security staff inspected me very precise, and I had to explain them my story. Thank god I have some scars left so they believed me!</p>

<p>However this is not a permanent solution for the future. Is there any international ""passport"" which my doctor and hospital do not know about? If not, what else are my possibilities?</p>

<p>I am not that afraid when travelling within the EU, however I fear that this situation might get quite dangerous when I'm in other countries...</p>

<p>It is not a problem. There are many, many people with metal implants
and the standard procedure is simply explaining your condition after
an alert is raised. You are singled out and checked with a hand
induction device. You need not to be afraid, this is standard practice.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However this is not a permanent solution for the future. Is there any
  international ""passport"" which my doctor and hospital do not know
  about? If not, what else are my possibilities?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are wrong on this account, it <em>is</em> the permanent solution. The idea
of checking you is to rule out the possibility that you smuggle something
on board.</p>

<p>Think about it:
If there were ""passports"" from a doctor, the very first thing people who
want to smuggle something into the plane is to <em>falsify such
documents to avoid detection</em>. Or even nastier, <em>coerce</em> people with a
real ""passport"" to smuggle something involuntarily on board.</p>

<p>It also does not help that the personnel will not be able to check the 
given ""passport"" in a reasonable time because your condition is part
of medical confidentiality and your personal privacy.</p>

<p>So simply explain your condition and wear comfortable clothes which makes
it easy to check your shoulder.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Another problem with the idea of ""passports"": Even if you have a passport, the personnel <em>still</em> needs to check you because you can still try to smuggle another thing on board. So a ""passport"" makes absolutely no difference. I suppose
the ""passport"" for bigger implants informs the personnel that their detector is functioning normally when it detects copious amounts of metal on your body.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT II</strong>: If you have several metal implants on different body parts, I consider it a good idea to have X-rays with the implants available so that the personnel can easily cross-check their detector findings with the implant locations.</p>

"Which city to visit in Mexico closest to Texas border","41613","","<p>While asking this question : <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/19731/requirements-to-drive-to-mexico-from-usa"">Requirements to drive to Mexico from USA</a>
I realized I would be better off asking this question first. 
While driving in personal truck, what would be the closest Mexican city/town/suburb from Texas border that one can visit to experience traditional Mexican culture and food? It would be nice if the city would have a few places to visit. We are not looking for anything fancy. Any places of archaeological importance or places with scenic beauty (just visually appealing). </p>
","<p>There isn't a lot, culturally speaking, on either side of the U.S./Mexican border.  So where to go depends a lot on exactly what you're looking for.</p>

<p>The main U.S./Mexican border crossings along the Texas border are:</p>

<ul>
<li>El Paso, Texas / <a href=""http://wikitravel.org/en/Ciudad_Juarez"">Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua</a></li>
<li>Laredo, Texas / <a href=""http://wikitravel.org/en/Nuevo_Laredo"">Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas</a></li>
<li>McAllen, Texas / <a href=""http://wikitravel.org/en/Reynosa"">Reynosa, Tamaulipas</a></li>
<li>Brownsville, Texas / <a href=""http://wikitravel.org/en/Matamoros"">Matamoros, Tamaulipas</a></li>
</ul>

<p>There are other crossings, but they are at essentially unpopulated areas, so for a cultural experience, they aren't really worth considering.</p>

<p>I have never crossed at El Paso / Ciudad Juarez, but Juarez has recently (in the last 5 years) been ranked as the most dangerous city in the world by some metric.  I'm not sure I would recommend visiting there, unless you have another reason to go.  It's also probably out of your way, depending on what part of Texas you are in.</p>

<p>This leaves the three other Mexican border towns:  Nuevo Laredo, Reynosa, and Matamoros.</p>

<p>Laredo and Reynosa are pretty dull.  I spent 3 days in Reynosa a month ago, because I have a friend there.  But we just spent time together... there's not much to see. I have also crossed the border at Nuevo Laredo countless times.  Also boring.</p>

<p>If you want to visit a border town, Matamoros is probably your best bet.  It has been 15 years since I was there, but it's close to the beach, and it (like Nuevo Laredo and Reynosa) offers authentic Mexican food.</p>

<p>I suggest reading travel guides (linked above) for each city, to make your own determination about where is ideal for you.</p>

<p>One important thing to consider, in light of your previous question: If you're only in the border regions (within 20km of the border, if memory serves) you do not need a vehicle permit, or even a tourist permit.  You only need these if you travel outside of the ""Free trade zone"".</p>

<p>If you are willing to travel outside of the free trade zone, then consider <a href=""http://wikitravel.org/en/Monterrey"">Monterrey, Nuevo León</a> as a destination. It's about a 2-hour drive from either Nuevo Laredo or Reynosa, and is much larger than any of the border towns.  It's also prettier, and has a lot more to offer, both in the city, and around the city (if you're interested in natural sights, etc).</p>

<p>The city of <a href=""http://wikitravel.org/en/Chihuahua_%28city%29"">Chihuahua, Chihuahua</a> might be another possibility, but I've never been there, so can't offer any personal suggestions.  It's also probably farther away from you, as it's closer to Ciudad Juarez.</p>

"What are the exact reasons why one cannot take a bottle of water on the plane?","41383","","<p>So what exactly are the reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>policy by the airlines?</li>
<li>slowing down security? </li>
<li>What if it's 100mL of water filled in one of those tiny travel bottles that people use to downsize their toiletries? </li>
</ul>

<p>I was just discussing this topic with a friend &amp; then realized while I know of the rule I would like to know all the aspects as to why.</p>
","<p>Because it's difficult to tell apart a bottle full water from a bottle full of a chemical like hydrogen peroxide that could be used to make liquid explosives.  There was <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_transatlantic_aircraft_plot#Liquid_explosives"">one hare-brained terrorist plot</a> that apparently tried this in 2006, and because ""passenger convenience"" will always lose out to ""bureaucratic ass-covering"" when it comes to security theater, <a href=""http://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/3-1-1-liquids-rule"">all liquids of all kinds were banned by the TSA</a>.  (Unless they're under 100ml, so yes, you <em>can</em> take a 100ml bottle of water on board...  if you can find one!)</p>

<p>In Japan, they've already got <a href=""http://9gag.com/gag/aLQP0bM/airport-bottle-scanner-in-japan-your-move-america"">bottle scanners that can identify suspect liquids</a>.  These are increasingly being adopted by other countries, and once they're widespread enough, the liquid silliness will hopefully end.</p>

<p>Note that while you can't take a partly or completely filled >100ml water bottle through security, it's perfectly fine to take an empty bottle through security, and fill it up before you board the plane. Or you can buy a bottle once you've passed security.</p>

"How do I prevent damage to electronic devices at airport security?","40797","","<p>I have travelled with a laptop before with no problems (not recently), but for an upcoming trip I will, for the first time, be carrying a smartphone and a Kindle (not the Fire but the older e-ink type).  I've seen complaints on the net that airport scanners have damaged Kindles, and I can't find anything conclusive about smartphones.  I want to carry these items, not put them in checked baggage.</p>

<p>What should I do to ensure that all of my gadgets still work when I get through the checkpoint?  If any of them should not go through the X-ray machine, how do I accomplish that?  (Just ask them to hand-inspect?)</p>
","<p>Millions of smartphones and 10's (if not 100's) of thousands of Kindles/E-book readers go through airport scanners every day.  So far I believe the number that have apparently been damaged by airport scanner stands at about 2 for Kindle, and I've never heard of a smartphone being damaged by any form of scanners. (And in the case of the Kindles there's serious doubt it was caused by the X-ray machine, and not simply broken in the customer bags)</p>

<p>In general the only items that should not be put through the standard X-ray machine are very high ISO film (800 or higher) and some very specialized medical devices (and if you had one of those, you'd already know about it).</p>

<p>You are far more likely to cause damage to your phone by dropping it when trying to put it in the tray than you are having it broken by the equipment itself.  There is no need to remove your Kindle from your carry-on bag, so just make sure it's packed well and you'll be fine.  If you're carrying a laptop you WILL need to remove that from your bag (unless you have a special TSA-approved laptop bag) - again the only real risk is in dropping it or forgetting to collect it afterwards.</p>

"How can I exchange Rs 500 & 1000 notes in India as a foreigner?","40314","","<p>I am travelling to India in late December. I exchanged cash for my trip a couple weeks back and now have a considerable amount of those 500 rupee notes which are <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/business-37938925"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">no longer valid</a>. I'm a bit at a loss what to do. </p>

<p>I read <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/82198/india-just-demonetized-all-rs-500-1000-notes-what-do-i-do-with-my-leftover-ca"">this other question</a> and realise that my options while overseas are quite limited. My local (Singapore) branches of Indian banks or money changers don't accept the notes and the Indian High Commission <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/IndiaInSingapore/posts/1249764028422791"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">refuses to give any useful answer</a>. However, as I will be travelling to India my situation is a bit different then the one mentioned in the related question.</p>

<p><strong>Is there any way I can exchange this money in India?</strong></p>

<p>Note that this is after the deadline (14th November) at which money can be exchanged by tourists at the airport. I am also not an Indian national, so depositing it into an Indian account is (as far as I know) not an option. </p>
","<p>I am in India. I know of people who have done this during the last few days without bank accounts while visiting on tourist visas. </p>

<p>Your first option is to take your passport and a few photocopies of both it and your visa and go to any bank. You're supposed to be able to exchange up to <a href=""http://economictimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/foreign-tourists-trip-on-indias-cash-crisis/articleshow/55628808.cms"" rel=""nofollow"">5000 INR</a> (if this is too low for you, there's a second option further down) into lower denominations or new bills after filling out some forms. Once you have the valid denominations, you're fine. </p>

<p>The catches are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There may be long lines. It's better to show up at 8 or 9 in the morning. You might have to wait for several hours. </p></li>
<li><p>Even after waiting, there is no guarantee that you'll succeed at any given bank. They may run out of cash at any time. If that happens, you'll just have to try again at another bank or time. If you can, try asking someone <em>before</em> getting in line, to at least get some idea of whether such exchange is possible. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>You can also do this at post offices. The above advice applies there too. Both that and the banks will be possible until December 30th.</p>

<p><strong>Second option:</strong> If the above sounds tedious to you (it is) you can try to <strong>sell the notes to someone</strong> for lower than their face value. That would effectively be paying them to go through the hassle of going to the bank, etc. If you have a local friend with a bank account, they could do this for you. </p>

<p>One of my friends just told me about such business taking place on a large scale in the town which I live. Apparantly they pay 80% of the face value of the money. This may be an option if you don't want to go through the hassle of the banks. Such businesses are probably operating somewhat outside the law, so keep that in mind. </p>

<p>Please note that <em>some</em> shops (especially large ones) do still accept the old notes.</p>

<p>The lines and limitations at banks may get better as time passes, but it's hard to know for sure. Also, it may be bad again at the end of December (when you'll be here) since it'll be the last chance to do it. (Except for going to the Reserve Bank of India before March 31, which sounds like a hassle.) </p>

<p>You might be able to do 5000 multiple times at multiple banks. </p>

<p>A travel blogger <a href=""http://austour.wordpress.com/2011/01/17/australian-customs-biscuits-and-chocolate-are-ok/"">actually emailed the Australian Customs</a> to see what the case was, and got a response:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thank you for your enquiry about bringing biscuits and chocolates into > Australia as part of your personal luggage.</p>
  
  <p>Cooked cakes, including cakes containing custard or dairy based fillings that have been cooked with the cake (excluding cheesecakes,
  mooncakes, dairy puddings, vanilla slices or Dulce de Leche), bread
  and shelf stable biscuits are allowed into Australia as part of your
  personal baggage from any country provided the items do not require
  refrigeration to maintain quality. Items that do not meet these import
  conditions must be re-exported from Australia or destroyed. Re-export
  of the items must be paid for by the importer.</p>
  
  <p>Cakes decorated with material such as fresh flowers, leaves, fruits or raw nuts that were not cooked with the cake may need to have
  the flowers, leaves, fruits or nuts removed. Alternatively, cakes
  decorated with prohibited fresh flowers, leaves, fruits or raw nuts
  that were not cooked with the cake must be re-exported or destroyed.
  Re-export must be paid for by the importer.</p>
  
  <p>To find the import conditions for bringing cheesecakes, dairy puddings or vanilla slices into Australia, you may consult AQIS’s
  Import Conditions database (ICON) at www.aqis.gov.au/icon. This
  database lists the Quarantine conditions under which various
  commodities may be brought into Australia. Using the ICON search
  facility, enter ‘Dairy’ into the ‘Commodity’ field, insert the country
  of manufacture in the ‘From country’ field and leave ‘All End Uses’ in
  the ‘For end-use’ field. Then, click “search” and the database will
  return the results. If an AQIS Import Permit is required, or if any
  other specific conditions apply, ICON will specify this.</p>
  
  <p>The information available on ICON is the same information that AQIS’s clearing officers use when inspecting and clearing goods
  arriving into the country. I recommend that you refer to this database

  <p>Confectionery (excluding Indian milk-based desserts and sweets) is permitted into Australia providing the items are free of contaminants
  such as live insects. Confectionery includes toffees, chocolate,
  fudge, boiled sweets, peppermints, marshmallows, liquorice, etc. It
  does not include liquid dairy desserts, spreads or drinks.</p>
  
  <p>Once passengers arrive in Australia, they are required to complete an Incoming Passenger Card (IPC). On the IPC, they must declare all
  items of food, animal or plant origin as well as any other articles
  that are covered on the card (e.g. medicines, wooden articles) – these
  items are only examples illustrating the types of items that must be
  declared under each category. All items of food, animal or plant
  origin must be declared on the IPC for the purpose of inspection by an
  Australian Quarantine Inspector.</p>
  
  <p>After passengers have collected their luggage, they will be directed to a Quarantine Officer who will inspect any declared items
  and inspect and/or x-ray any remaining luggage before they depart the

"What are safe uses of non-potable water?","39862","","<p>While traveling, you come across many different levels of water safety. In some countries you can drink the tap water, and in others you should avoid it at all costs.</p>

<p><strong>Where do you draw the line when you know the water isn't safe to drink?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Brushing your teeth?</li>
<li>Washing dishes?</li>
<li>Washing your hands?</li>
<li>Washing clothes?</li>
</ul>

<p>Do you also have to avoid eating anything that's liquid unless it's hot?</p>

<p>I'll give an example. I'm staying at a guesthouse in Bali that has a shared kitchen. There's a sign specifically stating that the water is non-potable, but we are asked to wash our dishes there. So the same cups I would use for eating and drinking have been washed with water that isn't safe. I've been doing it for a week and have been fine.</p>
","<p>This is hard to answer with an authoritative source since the quality of non-potable water varies widely from the source it comes from (is it groundwater? river water? is there anything recycled from drainwater from houses?) and even within a country.</p>

<p>I'm speaking mostly from my experience living in India, but in practice I have seen similar practices in Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand too. None of these places have potable water supply; the source is typically river or lake water. The reason why they are classed non-potable is primarily because of high mineral content or particulate matter, which can be purified for human consumption by  physical filtration as opposed to bacterial disinfection - although as it has become cheaper and more compact to make ultraviolet or reverse osmosis filters for home use, these are also used. Bacteria or viruses are the causes for most water-borne diseases, those can get into the water supply if untreated raw sewage is dumped into water sources which thankfully most civil authorities are not stupid enough to do.</p>

<p>So for the countries I mentioned, in practice, while it is customary to purify water for drinking either by boiling or using filtration devices, for other purposes such as washing clothes, washing dishes, cleaning hands, bathing, brushing teeth et al - essentially, anything that does not involve <em>ingesting</em> water, tap water is used directly. The water may taste funny for instance if you're brushing your teeth - that's because of the high mineral or iron content typically - but as for <em>safety</em>, yes, it can be considered safe.</p>

"Round trip vs two one-way tickets?","39789","","<p>Is there any substantial disadvantage to booking two one-way tickets, versus a round trip ticket?</p>

<p>Booking vacation travel with family of four for winter, from Northeast US to Mexico.  Round trip is pricy and no preferred travel times.  Two one ways is slightly cheaper with much preferred timing.    </p>

<p>Different airlines there and back, both reputable national US carriers.</p>
","<p>Leaving aside the question of <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/11501"">round trip versus one-way <em>fares</em></a>, there are some potential disadvantages to booking your outbound and return flights on separate one-way tickets as opposed to a single round-trip (aka return) ticket— unless all tickets happen to be fully flexible, fully refundable, full-fare tickets, which you won't be buying if you care at all about price.</p>

<p>Using separate tickets for each leg is not unlike <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/12823"">booking connections on different tickets</a>— <strong>you assume all risk</strong> if there is a problem with one leg that prevents you from boarding the next. If you find you need to fly into and out of PBI instead of MIA, you face two change fees instead of just one. If your outbound to OXR is canceled and you get rebooked to LAX for free, you'd need to change your return in a separate call and pay a change fee with the second airline.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if your first flights gets canceled or you get bumped and they can't reschedule you until after your trip becomes pointless, you won't be able to claim a trip-in-vain refund. And while you <em>might</em> be able to find a sympathetic agent for adjusting two separate one-ways on the same airline, it would be most extraordinary to find an agent sympathetic to changes made by another airline. (Of course, the longer the time between your flights, the less the above is a serious concern.)</p>

<p>Secondarily, you may lose some advantages built into round trips, though this is largely dependent on the particular fare rules of the tickets you do buy. For example, a round trip award ticket on United Airlines allows a stopover or an open jaw in each direction, but <em>no</em> stopovers are allowed on one-way tickets, severely reducing the benefit for travelers like me. Additionally, some coupons and other promotions may require a round trip fare.</p>

"Can I leave the UK and come back in, on a Tourist visa?","39645","","<p>I am a United States citizen with a 6-month Tourist visa to the UK (a stamp in my passport). Additionally, in 2013 I spent about two months in the UK on tourist visas, split between two separate occasions (one month in April-May, and one in August-September). My passport was stamped in December of 2013, and I have two other stamps from those previous visits (so three total, now)</p>

<p>My original intended departure date from the UK was March 1, but that is no longer the case, as I plan to stay out the duration of my visa.</p>

<p>My question is, can I leave the UK (to travel in Europe for a week, for example) and come back in with this visa? Will they re-stamp me, or see that my existing stamp is still valid? Will it be a problem that I've been coming-and-going in the UK relatively frequently? Are there any other concerns I should be aware of?</p>
","<p>Per the <a href=""http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/visas-immigration/visiting/general/requirements/"" rel=""nofollow"">UK Border Agency website</a>, a “general visitor” (with or without visa, depending on citizenship) should not “live in the UK for extended periods through frequent or successive visits”. So if you already made several long stays and try to come back for several months, there might be a (small?) risk that the border force officer checking your passport would suspect you are lying about the purpose of your stay in the UK and are actually living there illegally.</p>

<p>I also remember reading about a limit of not more than six months in any twelve months but I don't know if it's a hard limit or just a rule of thumb and I can't find any official source for that. If that's the case, traveling around March should be no problem, traveling in May would be more difficult (if I understand your description correctly, at that point, you will have spent 8 months of the previous year in the UK).</p>

<p>I am not a lawyer but I assume that formally, as in most countries, neither a proper visa (if your situation made one necessary) nor a previous visit would <em>entitle</em> you to enter the UK. Border officers will typically evaluate whether your fulfill the requirements for entry every time you cross the border, which means that every time you leave the country, you expose yourself to the risk of being refused entry, however small.</p>

<p>In any case, if you are questioned at the border, anything you might provide to establish that you are a legitimate visitor (details and documentation of where you stayed and will be staying, details of people you want to visit or things you want to do, name of places you intend to see, funds to support yourself, a return ticket to your country of residence, etc.) might be helpful.</p>

<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IyftD.gif"" alt=""http://www.trafficsign.us/650/reg/r10-10r.gif""></p>

<p>Intersections here often have three sets of traffic lights, one with left turn signal signs, one with right turn signal signs, and one with none.</p>

<p>All of the lights in the intersection are the standard 3 light variety. The green light is either a standard circle or an arrow. It is NOT the type with a green light and a red arrow. There are no signs that say ""No turn on Red"".</p>

<p>Can I turn right on red?</p>
","<p>From <a href=""http://www.dmv.state.pa.us/pdotforms/pa_driversmanual/chapter_2.pdf"">Pennsylvania Driver's Manual</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When there is a STEADY RED LIGHT, you must stop before crossing the marked stop line or
  crosswalk. If you do not see any lines, stop before entering the intersection. Wait for a green light before you start.</p>
  
  <p>You may turn right while the light is red, unless a NO TURN ON RED sign is posted at the intersection.
  You must first stop, check for and yield to pedestrians and other traffic.</p>
  
  <p>You may also turn left after you stop at a red light, if you are in the left lane and are turning left from a one-way street onto another one-way street, unless a sign tells you not to turn. You must first stop and yield to pedestrians and other traffic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And additionally</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although not common in Pennsylvania, a RED ARROW is used in other states. It means you may not turn in the direction the arrow points.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The sign you posted:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>RIGHT TURN SIGNAL</strong>
  This sign is posted close to a traffic signal to indicate that the signal controls right turn movements.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In practice this usually means that there are situations when it is possible to turn right but not go straight.</p>

<p>There is also <a href=""http://www.dmv.state.pa.us/pdotforms/young_drivers/tutorsguide.pdf"">DMV Guide to Young Drivers</a> which states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Making right turns at intersections with lights or signs:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Even when the light is green, look out for traffic turning left
  from the oncoming lane.</li>
  <li>Unless there’s a sign that says “No Turn on Red,” in
  Pennsylvania it’s legal to turn right even on a red light after
  coming to a complete stop – but only if there’s no traffic coming
  from the left or across the street, or pedestrians in

"Is it fair to buy a return ticket I know I will never use just because it's cheaper?","39490","","<p>I am planning a trip to <strong>Asia</strong> and then back to <strong>Rio</strong>. The thing is that I am traveling on flexible dates, so I am thinking of buying a one way ticket to <strong>Hong Kong</strong>, and I was planning to do the same when I want to come back.</p>

<p>But what I noticed is that, for example, a one way ticket from Melbourne to Rio costs no less than <strong>$2700</strong> dollars for the month of May.</p>

<p>When I do a search for a round-trip from Melbourne to Rio and back, I can find flights for <strong>$2200</strong>.</p>

<p>I know I will not be using that return to Melbourne, but I'd still prefer to save those <strong>$500</strong>. </p>

<p>Can there be any issue with buying a round-trip with a return that I will never use?</p>
","<p>You can do that. since one-way tickets are (almost) always more expensive. Booking a flexible return ticket will also be more expensive than the single ticket version, but you should look into it, since it should be cheaper than the double-return tickets in most cases.</p>

<p>But you better make sure that you know where and how to buy a ticket in Hong Kong and how much it will cost you AND you need to make sure which countries require you to have a home ticket before they let you in.</p>

<p>You will have to show return tickets on some immigration checkpoints or even airport check-ins. If you combine several stations and not have a valid return ticket, they will not let you travel. </p>

<p>Example: You fly to Hong Kong and stay there past the date of your intended ticket back home. You travel to Japan and then back to Hong Kong with the intention to buy a ticket back home in Hong Kong once you are there. At the check-in in Japan back to Hong Kong they will give you trouble already because you do not have a resident visa and you do not have an onwards trip booked.</p>

<p>Due to this issue, you might be better off to buy a flexible ticket where you can change the flight back from the beginning. Unless you can determine from the beginning which countries you go to, where you will buy what ticket and where you need an ticket back home or one for an onwards flight, you will have difficulties planning the trip without running into problems.</p>

<p>Or you book the flight back way past the intended return date - but close enough so that you are not indicating to an immigration officer that you will overstay your visa requirements. Then you just buy a new ticket to get back home instead of using your old one. </p>

<p>** Some more info regarding flexible tickets **</p>

<p>You have to know that for each flight, there are several different tickets with different prices - even if you buy at the same time from the same airline. The price depends on the flexibility of changing the ticket. If you want the cheapest ticket, you can get those, but changes can be VERY Expensive, up to the price of a new ticket. If you want to be more flexible, you will need to pay more for the ticket, but it you will be able to change it for a smaller fee. </p>

<p>I can only recommend you to call a travel agent to help you understand your ticket options. Since most online ticket sales are geared to sell cheap tickets, those often cannot be changed.</p>

"Is it considered uncouth to check in early into a hotel?","39121","","<p>I usually <strong>never</strong> early check into budget hotels. In relatively more expensive hotels (3-star or higher) I feel that it's appropriate to check in early, but not in cheaper hotels or hostels.</p>

<p>I don't know if my policy is correct or not, but sometimes I might run into problems if I'm arriving somewhere around 11:00 AM whereas the check-in time might be 2:00 PM. Would it be considered uncouth in either case (expensive vs. cheap) to request an early check in beforehand?</p>

<p>Does the appropriation of this differ <em>country by country</em>?</p>
","<p>I worked in a variety of hotels and hostels when I was a young backpacker and student. The simple answer is that it comes down to availability of rooms (or beds if you're staying in a dormitory).</p>

<p>Most hotels will post a check-in time of around noon to give them time to get at least some some rooms ready for the earlier arrivals, but even that should never be considered as a guarantee of getting into a room. </p>

<p>A typical hotel has just enough housekeeping staff to turn over all rooms in a day. Typically the rooms which are checking out (a full turnaround) are done first, followed by rooms which are staying (more or less just a tidy up). So if everyone turned up to check in at exactly 12 noon, then most of you would be waiting.</p>

<p>There is nothing ""wrong"" with arriving early, that is before the stated check in time, it's just that the chance of a room of the type you booked being ready diminishes the earlier in the day you arrive.</p>

<p>The worst that will happen is that they will usually offer to store your luggage for you while go you about your business. Reception will usually give you some indication of when your room will be ready.</p>

<p>If you really need your room (e.g. to shower and change), just explain your need and they may be willing to swap you to a room which will be ready sooner, or possibly even offer you the use of a room which is vacant but not yet made up specifically for the purpose of using the bathroom. It never hurts to ask politely and see what they can do for you.</p>

However, the internet (e.g. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_power_plugs_and_sockets#JIS_C_8303.2C_Class_II_.28Japanese_15.C2.A0A.2F100.C2.A0V_ungrounded.29"">Wikipedia</a>) tells me that Japanese power sockets ""appear physically identical"" to US ones (although they use a different voltage), so I'm wondering whether I can use an ""international adapter"" (e.g. <a href=""http://www.maplin.co.uk/worldwide-travel-adaptor-with-twin-usb-charger-393930"">this one</a>, with very a useful USB charging feature and multiple socket types) that can be used in the USA, or whether I'll have to wait til I get to the airport and pay more money for it. </p>
","<p>You need to distinguish between the physical plug shape and the voltage requirements of the device that you want to plug in.</p>

<p>If you have an adapter that is made for the USA, then yes, in most cases you will be able to plug in that adapter in terms of physical shape into sockets in Japan.</p>

<p>However, you will have to check with each device that you want to use if they support the voltage and mains frequency that you get in Japan out of the power socket. If the label on the device says for example 100-240v, 50/60 Hz (as it says on most laptop power supplies), it WILL work in Japan. If it says 110... or only 240v, then there is high chance that it will NOT work in Japan. Also, you must consider that different parts of Japan use different mains frequencies: 60 Hz which is used in the USA, and 50 Hz which is used in Europe. </p>

<p>The good thing when going from Europe (240v) to Japan (100v) is that you most likely will not ruin your equipment if you plug it in and it cannot work with 100v. The other way round would fry your device in most cases. If you plug it in, it will simply work - or not. If not, you can still try to get an alternative device in Japan for the time you are there. As a very basic rule of thumb: items that have a high ampere requirement (hair driers, toasters etc) will not work. Items that are made to be portable or for travel work in most cases. Check the sticker on the power supply for the ""input power"" requirements.</p>

"What's the best way to take a cold shower?","38925","","<p>This is a question that most people probably never think about, because it's an every-day thing.  But for many of us, such as myself, who grew up in more western cultures, with more modern conveniences, visiting places that don't have hot water can be quite an adjustment, perhaps even more difficult than learning to use a <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/q/3080/444"">new type of toilet</a>.</p>

<p>I know that not everyone handles cold showers the same. Some people dread them, others think nothing of them.  How can I learn to be in the latter category?</p>

<p>What physiological, mental or physical techniques exist that make cold showers more enjoyable?</p>
","<p>While growing up I had to turn on the heater before taking a shower and sometimes when its getting late, you really don't have time to do that. Here's some advice which might help.</p>

<p>I'm going to go ahead and assume that any hot water source is unavailable and you are in a frame of mind where the water is <strong>too cold!!!</strong></p>

<h2>Step 1 - Making Peace with the Cold Water</h2>

<p>Okay so you don't like cold water, the best way to make peace with it is to convince yourself that it's not too cold.</p>

<p>It's like entering a cold swimming pool, if you dip your feet in it for a while, it'll be easier for you to get in.</p>

<p>When you wake up in the morning, your body temperature feels lower because you haven't had breakfast yet, that's a good thing because it makes it easier to ease into the seemingly freakish cold water.</p>

<p><strong>If you happen to have a shower</strong>, then turn the shower on and let it gradually touch your feet first, followed by your hands. Keep the water running and slowly ease in from the extremities of your body all the way to your face. You face is the part which you'll dread the most, so save it till the end after you feel like the body temperature going down.</p>

<p><strong>If you happen to have a jug and a bucket of water</strong>, follow the swimming pool strategy. Fill in the bucket halfway and dip your feet and hands in it. Then slowly start pouring down the cold water on your hands and proceed.</p>

<p>One additional thing which might help is to have a towel on you. A towel which you could dip in the water and <em>squeeze out/rub</em> on your body will help.</p>

<h2>Step 2 - Taking the Leap of Faith</h2>

<p>You have to remember, <strong>practice makes a man perfect!</strong> Doing it the first time is much harder than doing it the <em>Nth</em> time.</p>

<p>After cooling down your body for a few minutes, hold your breath and step into the shower, as soon as you get into it, <strong>don't chicken out!</strong> The leap is the hardest, after it, it gets exponentially easier.</p>

<p>Same goes with a bucket of water and jug, when you're ready, repeatedly take a lot of water from the bucket and pour it over yourself. <strong>You start doing it, don't stop!</strong></p>

<p>Water in which you were dipping your hands or feet it will actually be warmer and make it a bit easier, which is why I feel <strong>using a bucket and jug is easier with cold water</strong>.</p>

<h2>Step 3 - Finish as soon as possible</h2>

<p>Remember, once you get into it, there's no coming back, there's no point doing the whole procedure from scratch again. So, keep pouring that cold water over you, it gets much easier when you keep doing it. Pause for short breaks only when you need to use soap or shampoo.</p>

<p><strong>Wash your body in little sections, torso at once, feet at once, hands at once etc. After you're done, get a fresh towel and hug yourself tight with it.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>I've done the exact procedure I mentioned a several hundred times in my life quite comfortably, of course I like my hot water, but where there's a will, there's a way.</p>

"Maximum length of stay on a multi-entry Schengen visa?","38873","","<p>My dodgy Colombian friend has a Schengen visa which is valid for 5 years.  It is a multiple entry visa but it also says you are permitted 90 days in the Schengen zone.</p>

<p>Is this 90 days total in 5 years, or is it 90 days from the date of initial entry into the zone?</p>
","<p>I have the <a href=""http://goeurope.about.com/od/europeantripplanning/f/schengen_stay.htm"">following information</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The maximum length of stay in Europe for non European Union passport
  holders is determined by the Schengen accord and is currently limited
  to 90 days within any 180 day period. The important thing to note is
  that you may not leave the Schengen Visa area for a day and return to
  restart the 90 day clock. In other words, you must be absent from the
  Schengen area for at least 90 days in a 180 day period to be legal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if you friend has a multiple entry visa for 5 years, he can stay a maximum of approximately 5 * 180 days (Stay 90 days, be absent for 90 days, and that for 5 years).</p>

<p>It isn't allowed to stay longer but I heard that those rules are rarely enforced and penalized, but if you're friend looks really that dodgy it might be better to not risk it ;)</p>

"What is the cheapest / fastest way to get from Brussels to Paris?","38393","","<p>There are several ways of getting from Brussels to Paris. The fastest is probably the train, but it gets more expensive when you buy the ticket on the last minute.</p>

<p>My question can be really split into two:</p>

<p>Is there an alternative way, maybe through a different ticket operator, of buying a cheap train ticket from Brussels to Paris in short notice?</p>

<p>The alternative is going by Bus. What alternatives are there? Are there other operators besides Eurolines? maybe cheaper and/or faster?</p>

<p>Are there other options?</p>
","<p>Thalys is definitely the fastest way of getting from Brussels to Paris. You can buy tickets directly at the Thalys website. You can also buy them at the Belgian (<a href=""http://www.b-europe.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SNCB</a>) or French (<a href=""http://www.voyages-sncf.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SNCF</a>) railway companies. The prices are in principle identical.</p>

<p>The trip by bus takes around 5 hours, to be compared to the 1h20 of the train trip. Apart from Eurolines you can use <a href=""http://be.idbus.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">iDBUS</a>. The prices are more or less the same. I have checked for a departure in 2 days. Eurolines is 25 EUR and iDBUS varies between 15 and 33 EUR depending on the departure time.

<p>In case you are unable to choose among the two bus companies, note that they are using different terminals in Brussels and Paris. Choose whichever suits you best.</p>

"How to get to/from Washington Dulles International Airport?","37910","","<p>How do I get to/from Dulles Airport in Washington, D.C.?  I've reviewed <a href=""http://www.metwashairports.com/dulles/793.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">the options on the website</a> and it's hard to tell what's actually the combination easiest/cheapest way.</p>

<p>We're staying near Eastern Market if that makes a difference.</p>
","<p>Considerations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dulles (like BWI) lies a considerable distance from the District; there are no ""obvious"" options because each involves a tradeoff of time or money. Only Reagan National (DCA) is truly convenient to the city.</li>
<li>If you have a large party or many bags, a taxi may be worth the hassle. There is no place to store bags when using public transportation, and a single ride on Metro can involve six or seven escalators— which these days are often out of service.</li>
<li>The Metro system is undergoing considerable construction and maintenance on evenings and weekends; at other times it can be quite crowded. This has negatively impacted its speed and reliability.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Silver Line Express bus</h2>

<p>While the <a href=""http://silverlinemetro.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Silver Line</a> Metrorail doesn't reach Dulles yet, its first phase to Wiehle-Reston East is in operation.</p>

<p>The Washington Flyer shuttle to West Falls Church has been discontinued. The <strong><a href=""http://www.flydulles.com/iad/silver-line-express-bus-metrorail-station"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Silver Line Express</a></strong> is its replacement, and is both cheaper and more frequent than its predecessor (but see below). It departs every 15–20 minutes from Wiehle-Reston East between 6am and 10:40pm weekdays, 7:45am-10:45pm on weekends. From Dulles, Silver Line Express tickets will be sold on the arrivals level of the Main Terminal, and the bus will depart from Door #4 (where the Washington Flyer used to depart).</p>

<p>For the return, the Washington Flyer stops inside the north parking garage at the Wiehle-Reston East station, and there should be signs. You will purchase tickets after you arrive at the airport.</p>

<p>The fare is a flat $5 each way. Note that this bus is operated by the airports authority, not by Metro, and the WMATA SmarTrip card is not accepted for payment.</p>

<p>The coaches are dedicated to the purpose, and include a luggage compartment below the cabin. Free Wi-Fi is promised on-board.</p>

<p>The more frequent and faster connection to rail is made possible because of the shorter distance the bus travels, but of course this means a slightly higher Metro fare to cover that distance.</p>

<h2>Metrobus 5A</h2>

<p>A second, potentially cheaper option is to take the <a href=""https://www.wmata.com/schedules/timetables/upload/05a.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">WMATA Metrobus 5A</a> to Rosslyn (~45 minutes), then transfer to the Blue/Orange/Silver Line and ride into the District (~25 minutes to Eastern Market). You can also stay on the 5A all the way to the end of the line at L'Enfant Plaza and transfer to Blue/Orange/Silver/Green/Yellow from there. This will take longer and mean more time on the bus, but if you arrive during the morning rush hour, it may be more civilized to keep your seat on the bus than to contend with the crowds at Rosslyn.</p>

<p>The 5A is an express service that makes only one or two stops before Rosslyn; however, it is an ordinary public bus, so at best it will have overhead racks for small bags, and it is often crowded. On the other hand, the fare is only $7, whether using cash or a SmarTrip card. Bring exact change if paying with the former.</p>

<h2>Taxis</h2>

<p>The Washington Flyer Taxi has a monopoly on service to the airport and its <a href=""http://www.flydulles.com/iad/estimated-taxi-fares"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">rates</a> are fixed (about $75 to Eastern Market plus surcharges and tips).</p>

<p>You can privately arrange for a different taxi or car service to pick you up, however, just as you might ask a friend or family member to pick you up. You can avoid the hassle of the taxi stand and maybe a few dollars as well, and if you come to Washington frequently, may be worth the investment of getting to know and keep a favorite driver.</p>

<h2>Uber / Lyft</h2>

<p>Uber and Lyft were made <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dr-gridlock/wp/2015/02/18/uber-and-lyft-are-now-legal-in-virginia/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">legal in Virginia</a> in 2015. Prices range from $50 for UberX to $105 for an UberSUV.</p>

<h2>Shared Van</h2>

<p>Another option is to take one of the <a href=""http://www.flydulles.com/iad/shared-ride-van-services"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">shared van services</a>. SuperShuttle's Dulles franchise is operated by the same company which runs the taxi fleet. <a href=""http://www.supremeairportshuttle.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Supreme Airport Shuttle</a> began operating around 2012. The vans make the most sense if you are traveling alone to a destination not well-served by Metro, but the rides can take a very, very long time if you are one of the later passengers to be dropped off. From Dulles, I generally only recommend this service for people traveling to the Virginia suburbs.</p>

<h2>One-way car rental</h2>

<p>Yet another option that makes sense for some is to <a href=""http://www.flydulles.com/iad/rental-cars"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">rent a car</a> from Dulles and return it to Reagan National the same day. Some rental agencies may waive the one-way fee on certain rate codes. If you have a good-sized party or many bags, this is sometimes an option. Of course, at least one person will need to take Metro or a taxi from Reagan National back to where you are in Eastern Market, and driving this route can be dicey during rush hours or if you are unfamiliar with the area.</p>

"Does the rotation of the earth affect the travel time from Europe to Australia?","37654","","<p>Assuming that a place in Europe is exactly on the opposite side of the earth than Sydney. Now I want to take a plane to travel there. Does it matter if the plan flies with the rotation of the earth or counter the rotation of the earth? i.e. Does it matter if the plane flies westbound or eastbound?</p>

<p>Intuitively I would say it does matter, because if I fly against the earth rotation the goal, in this case Sydney is coming nearer. On the other hand, maybe the plane is still in the atmosphere and therefore part of the earth rotation.</p>
","<p>This actually depends on quite a few factors.  I wondered this once many years ago, and asked around quite a bit. Didn't have Travel.SE back then ;)</p>

<p>The earth is rotating at a rather fast speed - and any point on the earth is therefore actually 'moving' (it's all relative).  Since the points on the equator have further to travel, they're moving even faster than at the poles.</p>

<p>Now, of course, the air is dragged around WITH the earth, thankfully, otherwise the poor chaps on the equator would have wind speeds in the opposite direction of near the speed of sound ;)</p>

<p>However, when you're in a plane, consider that it can take nearly an hour longer to fly across the Atlantic in a westerly direction ('against' the spin) than 'with' the spin.</p>

<p>When you're flying with the spin, and by relation, with the wind, you're not flying 'into' a force that's going the other way, as you are when you fly against the spin.  The earth is also dragging you with it - or rather, it's dragging the atmosphere, and you in it.</p>

<p>However, what you'll tend to find is that it's actually far more dependent in reality on the existence of jetstreams - where the air up there is moving faster than at ground level, and can boost the plane's speed if going in the same direction.  Of course, in the other direction you do well to avoid the jetstream, as it would slow you down.</p>

<p>To put it in words more eloquent than my own, I'll borrow a quote from <a href=""http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/dynamics/q0027.shtml"">Aerospaceweb.org</a>, which first, you must consider yourself to be running....</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stop running. If you were to jump straight up in the air, would the
  Earth rotate beneath you? (Those who do believe that the Earth rotates
  around them may want to stop reading right now.) No, because when you
  left the Earth's surface, you were traveling at the same speed as the
  surface, so, in essence, the Earth matched your speed through space
  while you were in the air! The same condition holds true for an
  airplane as it travels from Los Angeles to Bombay. If we were to
  ignore the winds, no matter which direction you flew from Los Angeles,
  the speed of the aircraft relative to the Earth would be the same.
  While the aircraft's speed through space would change, the effect of
  the Earth's rotation remains constant, and in effect is ""cancelled
  out"" no matter which direction you travel. In other words, the speed
  of the rotation of the Earth is already imparted to the aircraft, and
  the Earth matches that speed during the entire flight. (Of course, in
  the case of spacecraft, these speeds become very important.)</p>
  
  <p>So, the end result of that long discussion is that the rotation of the
  Earth has no effect on the travel time of an aircraft. Actually, it is the headwinds and tailwinds that cause the change
  in travel times. Sometimes it is hard to believe that the winds can
  have that much effect, so let us consider the problem a bit more in
  depth. In the example given, the flight from Bombay to California
  (east) is 23% shorter than the trip from California to Bombay (west).
  This means that the speed of the trip east must be 23% faster. The
  prevailing winds pretty much anywhere that we are talking about blow
  from west to east, so when we are traveling east, we get a speed gain,
  and when we travel west, we get a speed penalty. Now, if we are to
  assume that the winds are identical on both days we fly, then the wind
  speed only needs to be equal to 11.5% of the aircraft's speed! This
  would cause a difference between the speed to the west and speed to
  the east of 23%! The cruise speed of the extended range Boeing 777 is
  about 550 mph (885 km/h) at 35,000 ft (10,675 m). This means that the
  winds only need a speed of about 65 mph (105 km/h) (good kite
  weather). Believe it or not, 65 mph is a very typical wind speed at
  such a high altitude. Speeds of over 100 mph (160 km/h) are not
  uncommon. If we wanted to make things more complicated, we could
  consider a region of high speed flow called the jet stream that flows
  eastward, and if an aircraft can take advantage of these winds, then
  the travel time can be reduced further.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also note <a href=""http://hint.fm/wind/"">this LIVE amazing display of the prevailing winds in the USA</a>, which affect all this.</p>

<p><strong>So what is the bottom line? The direction you travel in relation to the rotation of the Earth does not affect the travel time of an aircraft, and, more importantly, a mere 65 mph wind is more than enough to cause a difference in travel time of five hours when you are traveling long distances!</strong> </p>

","<p>There are some <strong>direct buses</strong> from Buenos Aires to Santiago de Chile. For example, <a href=""http://www.catainternacional.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">CATA Internacional</a> runs a daily bus, on weekdays only (Mon-Fri), which leaves at 17:00 from BA (Retiro) and arrives next day at approximately 12:30 (= duration ~19.5 hours). The price is $AR 900 / USD ~105 (<em>semicama</em> without service) or $AR&nbsp;1050 / USD&nbsp;~125 (<em><a href=""http://www.catainternacional.com/servicio-cama.php"" rel=""nofollow"">cama ejecutivo</a></em>) as of Nov 2014. </p>

Prices on Pullman del Sur from CH$&nbsp;55,000 (USD&nbsp;~100).</p>

<p>Alternatively, take the bus to <strong>Mendoza, Argentina</strong>  (12+ buses daily; 13-16 hours, USD&nbsp;60–110 depending on company and comfort level), located quite close to the Chilean border, and then continue from there to Santiago (about 8 buses daily, 6-7 hours, USD 40-65). The mountain pass and border crossing is called <em><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paso_Internacional_Los_Libertadores"" rel=""nofollow"">Los Libertadores</a></em>.</p>

<p>I haven't taken this trip to Santiago myself (only to Mendoza), but I'm fairly sure that the bus is your best (and maybe only) bet, and that you won't encounter any major problems. The coaches in Argentina and Chile are comfortable and reliable. (For a long trip, I recommend investing in <em>cama suite</em> or whatever the best option is called, to be able to sleep better.) You can see timetables and buy tickets (with credit card) online at <a href=""http://www.plataforma10.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Plataforma 10</a>, or you can visit the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retiro_bus_station"" rel=""nofollow"">Retiro main bus terminal</a> in Buenos Aires <a href=""http://goo.gl/maps/hVaPG"" rel=""nofollow"">[map]</a>  for the same.</p>

<p>By the way, Mendoza is a nice place known especially for its wines, and some of the highest peaks of the Andes nearby, and stopping there for a few days wouldn't be a bad idea.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: updated for <strong>November 2014</strong>. The prices in local currency keep rising <em>a lot</em> (for example, Mendoza–Santiago trip went from 120 to 230 pesos during just five months in 2013). The Argentine peso is weakening at the same time, however, so visitors do not feel it as badly.</p>

"What exactly is a ""No Objection Certificate"" (NOC)?","37275","","<p>In researching a potential trip in Pakistan <a href=""http://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Pakistan"">on Wikivoyage</a> I came across this term which is not well explained:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The visitor should be aware of the ever changing rules regarding <strong>sensitive areas</strong> and <strong>No Objection Certificates</strong> (NOCs), Note Verbals and other permissions and paperwork some in officialdom deem necessary for your to travel around the country. The most notorious NOC regulation is for foreigners to enter Kashmir, with the intention being so the security services can keep track (i.e. follow) foreigners to make sure they don't visit places they shouldn't. Outside Kashmir diplomats are the primary user of NOCs and theoretically the normal tourist should be exempt. However those in officialdom can view all foreigners with suspicion and demand an NOC when you step of a plane or out of a bus. NOCs need to be applied for through the Ministry of Interior, however if you are traveling on a non-diplomatic passport you should be fine - but its good to be aware of this nonetheless.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Objection_Certificate"">There is a Wikipedia article</a> but it is very brief and not very well worded:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>No Objection Certificate</strong> or popularly abbreviated as <strong>NOC</strong> is a type of legal certificate issued by any agency, organization, institute or in certain cases, an individual, that does not object to the covenants of the certificate. This certification is a requirement at most of the government-based departments predominantly from the Indian subcontinent..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can somebody explain better than these sources what an NOC actually is? Is it a kind of permit?</p>
","<p>In general, a NOC is a letter indicating the writer of the letter has no objection to the terms contained within said letter.
Sounds very meta, but basically it's like saying 'I have no objection to what I'm writing about, and this is legal evidence stating so.'</p>

<p>Now why would that be useful?  Let's take a common example. </p>

<p>A government employee wishes to take leave from his job and travel to the a certain country A from country B.  To prove that he's able to leave his job temporarily, his department may issues a NOC to indicate that they're ok with him leaving for his 6 month holiday (which may raise questions in other cases due to its length) and that they're covering his leave.  If he's a government employee, they may also issue a NOC to indicate that they're ok with him being issued a passport.</p>

<p>NOCs are also <a href=""http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090819034139AAC318W"">common in business</a>, for example.</p>

<p>In this case, given the status of diplomats and the political impact they can have when travelling, and given their immunity status as well, it's often in a government's best interest to require NOCs to make sure that the home government of country B knows that the diplomat is travelling to country A, and that they're legally stating they're ok with what he's doing there.  This also prevents country B from later claiming they had no knowledge of their diplomat's actions.</p>

<p>In highly politically-charged areas like Kashmir, it stands to reason that concern be even greater about tracking, noting and stating the intent of political activities, diplomats and emissaries. </p>

<p>However, Joe Tourist on the other hand, is usually not such a problem to countries.  Of course, any concern or suspicion on their part would be nullified with an NOC, especially one from your employer stating that they, for example, know you're on holiday and are expected back at work in a few weeks.</p>

"Why are passports checked at the check-in counter, Immigration and even at the gate?","37185","","<p>I was wondering, why there are passport checks at the check-in counter, Immigration and even at the gate?  </p>

<p>For example, I was at Istanbul flying to either UK or US. There's a security check at the check-in counter asking a bunch of questions about my immigration status - even more than the Immigration officer at the border. Also, at the gate, there's also Security officer checking my immigration status and passport asking the same questions.  </p>

<p>I thought that would be the responsibility of an Immigration officer rather than some third party company? </p>

<p>The thing I'm curious the most is they don't even know which countries this passport can go to with or without visa. They have to go back to the counter and check with the system which takes a long time. I was wondering why they hire these kind of companies to slow down the process?</p>
","<p>Passports are your ID when traveling globally.  Driver licenses and national IDs are not always accepted as a form of ID in many countries.  As such everyone who needs to verify your identification will ask to see your passport.</p>

<p>For flights to the USA, there is often several layers of security employed.  The first is a security check before you reach the check in counter, with a number of questions regarding destination, what you might be carrying etc.  They will check your passport.</p>

<p>When you check in for the flight, the airline will need to document your identity (via your passport) and also if you have the proper visas or permissions to enter the country, as the airline will be fined if they knowingly board you without proper documents.</p>

<p>Departing Immigration is only concerned about your visit to their country, they could care less if you are permitted to enter the next destination.</p>

<p>At the gate, another layer of the US imposed security will again check your passport, boarding pass and sometimes even look through your carry on bags. They may also ask if you have the necessary documentation to enter the country.  Why this last security check ... because you could give your boarding pass to someone else after you have checked in, someone who has less than desirable ideas in mind.</p>

<p>And as I mentioned in my comment, it is impossible for any of these people to know all the rules for all the passports that might be presented.  Too many rules and exceptions.</p>

"What is the difference between folio and invoice in hotel management?","37044","","<p>I was curious about the difference between folio and invoice in hotel management terms. Some hotel say invoice and others say folio. Are there difference?</p>
","<p>A folio is a list of your charges. For example, phone calls, minibar, laundry services, room service, valet, etc. anything that is billed to your room.</p>

<p>Hotels maintain separate folios, typical ones are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Guest</li>
<li>Staff</li>
<li>Master (assigned for group accounts; for example a tour group consisting of multiple guests)</li>
<li>Non-guest (assigned for other services; for example the valet service might be outsourced to a third party, etc.)</li>
</ol>

<p>They are mainly used for accounting and to separate charges for easy tax purposes. </p>

<p>The invoice in hospitality is no different than an invoice for any other good or service - it is simply proof of how much you have paid and against/for what (good or service).</p>

<p>As soon as you check in, a folio is opened for your room. All services tendered are recorded here, but when you come to checkout - only the <em>billable services</em> are recorded as part of your invoice.</p>

<p>So, if in-room wifi or an airport shuttle is free for your room type, then these charges are still recorded in the folio, but are not part of your invoice.</p>

<p>They are recorded in the folio because at the end, the hotel has to balance those charges.</p>

"How to transfer from JFK to Newark using public transportation?","36912","","<p>In a couple days, I will be flying into JFK, then I'll have to catch a connecting domestic flight at Newark. The duration between scheduled landing at JFK and departure at Newark is 4 hours and 50 minutes.</p>

<p>The public transportation option I could figure out is :</p>

<ul>
<li>AirTrain to Jamaica Center</li>
<li>E subway line to Penn Station</li>
<li>NJ Transit train to Newark Airport station</li>
</ul>

<p>Another possible option is :</p>

<ul>
<li>AirTrain to Jamaica Center</li>
<li>LIRR to Penn Station</li>
<li>NJ Transit train to Newark Airport station</li>
</ul>

<p>As I did not find clear information about doing this transfer, which of both is the most practical and cost-effective? Is LIRR that much faster than the subway?</p>

<p>Also, can I buy a single ticket for the whole route or do I need to buy another ticket at Penn Station for the remainder of the trip?</p>

<p>And lastly, given the available transfer time, can we plan hanging out in NYC maybe for 30 min - 1 hour or should we better head straight to Newark?</p>
","<p>You can find complete information on the LIRR and subway at <a href=""http://mta.info"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mta.info</a>.</p>

<p>Generally, the LIRR is faster, more comfortable, and more expensive.</p>

<p>The LIRR takes 20 minutes from Jamaica to Penn Station.  It is a commuter train with regular coach cars; there is a seat for every passenger and overhead racks for small bags.  The regular adult fare is $9.50 during peak times (M-F from about 6-10 AM in this direction), $7.00 at other times on weekdays; It's $4.00 on Saturday and Sunday.  The trains run at fixed times and you can find a timetable <a href=""http://web.mta.info/lirr/Timetable/Branch/CityTerminalBranch.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<p>The E train takes about 40-45 minutes to Penn Station.  (Note that Airtrain access is via the Sutphin Blvd stop, not Jamaica Center.)  Cars have limited seating and no luggage racks; there is a fair chance that you will have to stand with your luggage for the whole trip.   The regular adult fare is $2.50 at any time of day.  The trains run frequently but don't have a fixed schedule. </p>

<p>You will need to buy 2-3 separate tickets for the different legs of this journey:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>To ride Airtrain from JFK to the LIRR or E train, the fare is $5, paid with a <a href=""http://web.mta.info/metrocard/"" rel=""nofollow"">Metrocard</a>.  You can get a Metrocard at a vending machine; there should be some on the Airtrain platforms or inside the airport.  Cash and credit cards are accepted.  There is a $1.00 surcharge for the Metrocard itself, or if you already have one, you can just add money to it.  More information about Airtrain can be found <a href=""http://web.mta.info/mta/airtrain.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> and <a href=""http://www.panynj.gov/airports/jfk-airtrain.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>If you take the subway, the fare is also paid with a Metrocard.</p></li>
<li><p>If you take the LIRR, you should buy a ticket from a vending machine on the LIRR platform before boarding, which will accept cash or credit cards.  If you don't, you can also buy a ticket from the conductor on the train, but there is a surcharge of about $6 and only cash is accepted.</p></li>
<li><p>When you get to Penn Station, you'll need to buy another ticket for <a href=""http://www.njtransit.com"" rel=""nofollow"">NJ Transit</a>, preferably from a vending machine (cash or credit).  (There is also a staffed ticket window, and you can also buy from the conductor on the train, but again there is a surcharge.)  The regular adult fare to Newark Airport is $12.50.  You use the same ticket to ride the EWR Airtrain monorail from the Newark Airport station to the airport terminal itself, so do not lose it.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the subway, LIRR and NJ Transit platforms are all in different parts of Penn Station, so allow yourself some extra time to navigate your connection there.</p>

<p>You might be able to squeeze in an hour or so to look around NYC.  I would suggest that when you get to Penn Station, you check the schedule of departing trains (you want either the Northeast Corridor or North Jersey Coast lines), choose a train that will get you to EWR with as much time as you want (I'd allow 30-40 minutes from Penn Station to EWR's terminal), and then see how much time you have in between.</p>

<p>Is it necessary to wait, or can I get these vaccinations done now so that I have one more thing out of the way?  Are travel vaccinations like ""routine"" vaccinations in that you just need to keep up on them every year or so, or do you really need to take them closer to when you travel?</p>
","<p>The advice to get vaccinated 3-4 weeks prior to traveling should be read as ""<em>at least</em> 3-4 weeks prior"". Typically, it takes your body's immune system a little while to respond to the vaccine by creating antibodies. Thus, if you travel immediately after getting a vaccination, you may still be vulnerable to those infections.</p>

<p>In the case of hepatitis vaccine the protection it affords will last 10 years. So getting it a bit sooner than 4 weeks prior to travel is a non-issue. I've never heard of a vaccine that doesn't afford at least 3 years protection. </p>

<p>So, in summary, if it is more convenient to get your vaccinations 6 months prior to travel, then go right ahead. Just keep track of the duration of their effectiveness for future travels. You'll need to 'top them up' sooner then otherwise as a consequence.</p>

<p>If you arrive by unconventional means, you will run into the burden of proving the legitimacy of your visit.  It is upto you as a traveller to prove you have the right to be in the country and that you have arrived legally and are not violating any laws (for example, by smuggling goods).</p>

<p>One way to do this is to enter via a know port of entry (such as the airport) where the government provides facilities to assist with your legal entry.</p>

<p>If you arrive by boat/fisherman - and then leave by airport, you may be questioned as to why you don't have an entry stamp (if such a thing is required) and this may lead to many further complications - ranging from a fee to detention and deportation.</p>

<p>Further if you are intercepted by the coast guard, you'll have to come up with more than a smile to explain what you are doing ferrying across instead of taking the normal route.</p>

<p>If you happen to cross into the territorial waters and are then intercepted, you are effectively an illegal immigrant. The coast guard doesn't have the authority to validate your visa; so you'll be taken into custody and then ... well, I would just rather not risk it.</p>

I have noticed that nobody ever stamps a page that has a remnant of something once stapled in there in Japan. There is a kind of stub that had its major part torn off along a perforation. Might I be able to emulate this somehow or would that even be worse making the blank pages invalid for full page visas due to having holes from staples? I know some things can get very picky when it comes to customs and immigration.</p>
","<p>If you have a brand new passport, then keep all the pages together with an elastic band, and only release new pages when the old ones are full.  This has kept things nice and orderly for me so far - the only place anyone took off the band was Taiwan where they at least stamped only the next page and not some random mid-passport place.</p>

<p>If your passport is already in use, then a full page post-it note works fine and leaves no residue - write on it ""Reserved for Visa"" if you think that will help.  Make sure the sticky part of the post-it is towards the outside of the page so it's not so simple to just stamp underneath it.</p>

So does Airfrance with Paris. Also I have recently seen an ad in subway about free stopover in Iceland from Icaelandair. Do you know more elsewhere, especially in Asia?</p>
","<p>Most airlines don't charge extra for stopovers (in fact, more often, they charge less, because the route is less convenient than a non-stop flight). They like to advertise ""free stopovers"" to make you think this is a great benefit they are giving you.</p>

<p>For example, if you are flying from New York to Dubai, the rich business traveller is going to want to take Emirates nonstop. Since Emirates is the only airline operating that route nonstop, they can charge whatever they want (it's showing as $2270 right now). Meanwhile, British Airlines, Qatar, Air France, KLM, United, Delta, and Royal Jordanian would all <em>love</em> to take your money on that route, but they can't do it nonstop, so they offer cheaper fares (now showing $1186-$1782) with connections in their home airports (London, Doha, Paris, Amsterdam, Washington, Atlanta, and Amman, respectively). And they will all be happy to let you stay over in their home town for a day or six without extra charge if it induces you to tolerate the connection.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9KRwb.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Since very few people actually WANT to go to Iceland, and connecting in Reykjavik is hardly anybody's idea of a good time, Icelandair has to advertise ""Free Stopovers"" to induce people to think this is a great bargain and a fun thing to do.</p>

<p>IN FACT, in many cases, you will find cheaper fares from A->B->C->B->A than you will find from A->B->A, because of the premium placed on nonstop travel.</p>

<p>To find ""free stopovers"", just do an online search for your end point, and look at the various connection cities that are available. (<a href=""http://www.hipmunk.com"" rel=""noreferrer"">Hipmunk</a> does a good job of this). Then if you want to book it, redo the search as a multilegged trip and you should see that the calculated fare is the same or even cheaper depending on travel days.</p>

<p>So for example, if you want to see what stopovers are available from New York to Dubai, you do the search in Hipmunk and you'll see various flights connecting in London, Doha, Paris, Amsterdam, Washington, Atlanta, and Amman. So now you can search for multi-legged journeys from New York to Paris to Dubai to New York and the fare should come out similar to the Paris connection option. (I actually just tried that and saw that it was about $30 more, which is probably just an airport tax).</p>

<p>The best stopover options are in major cities where large airlines have their hubs. So even though Lufthansa isn't advertising anything on the New York to Dubai route, I'm pretty sure that I could search for New York - Frankfurt - Dubai - New York and find a fare that was pretty cheap compared to the New York - Dubai nonstop. (I just tried that and it was $800 less to stop in Frankfurt than to go nonstop, and only $100 more than the cheapest connection).</p>

<p>If you are planning to stopover anyway, that may create an opportunity to travel on Tuesday or Wednesday when fares are lowest.</p>

If you are not resident in the EU, she will require a EU visa (Schengen visa if you're a Schengen country citizen), but this (by law) must be free and granted essentially automatically, all you need to prove is that you are married.</p>

<p>But you'd be well advised to sort this out in advance, and for a short tourist stay of less than 60 days, I don't really see much advantage over <a href=""http://www.visas.com.au/schengen-visa-for-australians/"" rel=""nofollow"">the automatic visa on arrival that Australians get anyway</a>.</p>

"Does Venice smell?","35455","","<p>I keep getting told that Venice smells pretty bad as a reason not to go (a lot of people say it's pretty crowded too but that's another matter). Apparently it's the canals in summer. </p>

<p>Is this true? Does Venice have a problem with it's aroma or is this a bit of an old wives tale?</p>
","<p>I was in Venice in summer 2013. It didn't smell bad, even though it was hot. We asked some locals (who we were staying with) about the legendary smell.</p>

<p>Historically, raw sewage was simply dumped into the canals and (eventually) washed out to sea. This had been the status quo for centuries, with some improvement over the years but there was still lots of old plumbing. With increasing population and increasing tourism, the smell problem got steadily worse as the years went by. It was particularly bad on hot summer days.</p>

<p>A while ago (maybe 10-20 years ago), the city recognised the smell as a problem and started a programme to clean it up. They did a few key things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cleaned out the sludge and gunk from the canals, scrubbing and dredging</li>
<li>Required that new plumbing comply with strict new standards</li>
<li>Started a plumbing remediation effort to fix all the old plumbing</li>
</ul>

<p>Our hosts had to replace their former home plumbing system with a triple septic tank system a few years earlier. The overall result has been a dramatic improvement in the smell throughout the city. </p>

<p>So, my experience (on hot summer days) is that Venice smells just fine now. But it wasn't always this way.</p>

"How to escape hip-hop CD giveaway scam in New York City?","35422","","<p>Here is a situation I encountered multiple times in New York City streets, lately.</p>

<p>Usually at a sidewalk corner where people are likely to wait for the pedestrian crossing ""walk"" signal, a gang of two, three, four people are present. One of them hands a CD in a plastic pocket, supposedly a pre-release brand new rap album of the guy. The way he wants you to take the CD is rather aggressive. Another man of the gang does the same thing, even asking for your name and writing it on the plastic pocket. They even give you extra CDs, makes no sense!</p>

<p>The trouble comes when they all start asking for money, talking about a donation. It begins by $1, $5... and it seems very difficult to say no as the guys do not want to take the CDs back. As they look physically in good shape and likely to have regular workouts at the gym, they appear impressive, and the idea of getting into an argument is just out of the question.</p>

<p>In the process of taking the money out of the wallet to pay the forced donation, when I was caught in that scheme, I accidentally let them see a $20 bill in my wallet. They wanted it right away and gave me minimal change out of it ""as it is for their friends too"".</p>

<p>How can one escape this situation safely without giving out any money?</p>

<p>Note for duplicates: This situation, even if similar to the string scam used in other cities, is unique due to the approach of someone looking friendly and the realistic expectation to discover new music. And such people are rather difficult to ""calculate"" on first sight. Furthermore, I was not aware of similar schemes with different objects used before living the scam for real.</p>
","<p>A few things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Avoid making eye contact with them.</strong> Nothing will make them come up to you more aggressively than eye contact. You've seen them, they saw you see them, and they know it's a lot harder for you to ignore them now.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>As stated above, do not engage.</strong> If they approach you and you cannot immediately walk away just say no. Repeatedly say no if pressed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Blow right past them.</strong> If you are not stuck on that corner just walk right past them without regarding them at all. Do <em>not</em> let them stop you. If one of them tries to block your way walk around them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wear headphones,</strong> even if you don't intend to listen to anything (and you shouldn't be.) It's much easier to ignore someone when you can pretend that you can't hear them. People are also much less likely to approach you if you are wearing headphones.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>If you did engage, do <em>not</em> take the CD.</strong> This is the <em>worst</em> thing you could do.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>If you have taken the CD</strong> and they refuse to take it back, gently put it on the ground and walk away.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I live in NYC and do not have an issue with these people and have not since I was new there. You simply ignore them.</p>

"How do customs and immigration work in a sailboat?","35373","","<p>So, I have this crazy dream.  I'd love to purchase a little sailboat, make my way down the East Coast, across the Carribean, down South America, and end up in the Falklands, maybe Tierra Del Fuego, and Antarctica if I really could develop some seamanship skills. As I think about the logistics, I realize, it's a bit of an undertaking, but from a skill level, it seems ""do-able.""  </p>

<p>What has just occurred to me from a planning perspective, however, is that I have just totally  schluffed off the important legal niceties, of oh, entering a foreign country!  But then I realize, a coastline is way bigger than the secured portion of an airport.</p>

<p>So, here's the question.  Let's say I've shoved across from Florida and sailed down to Brazil.  Yes, that's a long trip, but I'm going to guess the islands are a bit more sophisticated when its comes to ports. When I show up in Brazil, what's to stop me from pulling into a harbor, getting out of the boat, walking into the town, and buying supplies?</p>

<p>At what point do I need to show my passport, do a customs declaration or in any fashion present myself to authorities as a gringo who needs to be admitted to the country?</p>

<p>In other words, how do I legally enter a country when I'm in a private sailboat?</p>
","<p>A friend did something similar, where he kayaked from Vancouver, Canada to Alaska.</p>

<p>Turns out you need to report in the same day you arrive.  He was tired and slept that night, and the next day went to check in.  Naturally there was a) no record of him leaving Canada and b) he'd been on US soil for 24 hours as an illegal alien.  They sent him packing and there's some interesting legalities about whether he can go back now...</p>

<p>Then an Irish backpacker I met in Colombia had crossed from Venezuela into Colombia across a bridge where there wasn't a checkpoint, despite being told there was one.</p>

<p>So she bussed down to the next town where there was one, and went to sign in.  They pointed out that she hadn't signed out of Venezuela.  So she had to go across the river again (across a bridge that was literally on fire, but that's a different story) to sign out, and then return to Colombia to sign in.</p>

<p>So it's a little flexible depending on the country.  However, whenever you leave a port, ask the officials there, as they'll be certain to know what the rules are about getting to the next place. Check with the embassies for those countries.</p>

<p>For example, <a href=""http://www.therealcostarica.com/travel_costa_rica/entry_costa_rica.html#landboat"" rel=""nofollow"">Costa Rica</a> points out this bit about signing out of the previous country first, and then presenting your documents when you arrive.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.cbp.gov/travel/pleasure-boats-private-flyers/pleasure-boat-overview"" rel=""nofollow"">USA</a> is very specific, requiring you to report your arrival to CBP (Customs and Border Patrol) immediately.</p>

<p>Once you've reported either in person or by communication to an office, they'll usually advise on whether you need to come in to get a stamp or fill out paperwork and so on.  Always report in a timely fashion, always try to go directly to an official port with immigration facilities, and always get it in writing if possible to confirm that you've done the right thing.</p>

"To how much radiation are you exposed on a transcontinental flight?","35218","","<p>You often hear people object to being scanned because of the ""<a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/6021/correct-reasons-for-opting-out-of-millimetre-wave-scanners"">radiation</a>"" argument. I find this always quite amusing from people just being exposed to higher radiation levels during the average airplane flight. I once read a article on the levels of being exposed to radiation in everyday live, but I lost the article. I remember that the exposure in planes was quit substantial. Somewhere in the order of one body scan is equal to 10 minutes of your average transcontinental flight. </p>

<p>So my question is, to how much more radiation are you really exposed while traveling in an airplane, compared to staying on the ground?</p>
","<p>The amount of radiation you're exposed to on an airplane flight depends on a variety of factors, including the altitude, latitude, and duration of the flight. As an example, a flight from New York to Tokyo is probably about 150 μSV. For comparison, natural background radiation is about 2,000-7,000 μSv per year, a chest x-ray is about 50 μSv, and a medical CT scan is about 10,000 μSv.</p>

<p>Some of the other answers have referred to the BED (banana equivalent dose), but unfortunately the BED is scientifically wrong, because the body maintains a constant amount of potassium, so ingesting more doesn't increase your exposure.</p>

<p>The question asked about the comparison with the radiation exposure from airport scanners. There are two types of full-body scanners, backscatter x-ray and millimeter wave. In the US, the TSA is eliminating all backscatter x-ray scanners by June 2013, so the only type remaining will be millimeter wave scanners. Millimeter wave scanners do not use ionizing radiation, so the radiation exposure is zero. I assume backscatter x-ray machines will continue to be used in airports in at least some other countries; the radiation exposure is about 0.05-0.1 μSv per scan, which is about a thousand times less than exposure during the flight.</p>

<p>There is strong evidence that small doses of radiation do not cause even a small negative health effect in proportion to the dose (which would be the LNT, linear no-threshold hypothesis). In fact, there is quite a bit of evidence that small radiation doses provide a health benefit, an effect called radiation hormesis. This may be because the radiation activates cellular repair mechanisms. However, the dose received from an airplane flight is much too small to provide any positive or negative effect worth considering on an individual basis.</p>

"How does the Schengen 90/180 rule work?","35165","","<p>I have searched the web a lot and could not find an answer that fits my situation.

I want to visit Sweden from <code>February 10th 2013</code> to <code>May 10th 2013</code> (89 days). I have applied for a Schengen visa again (for research). How will the 90/180 rule work in my situation?</p>
","<p>Prometheus's answer was originally correct but the Schengen Borders Code has been amended by <a href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:182:0001:0018:EN:PDF"" rel=""noreferrer"">Regulation (EU) 610/2013</a> to counter the court's interpretation.</p>

<p>As of October 18, 2013 your stay should be “no more than 90 days in any 180-day period”. In particular, you should have been present less than 90 days during the past 180 days when leaving the Schengen area. Information about this is available on the website of the <a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/borders-and-visas/border-crossing/index_en.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">the EU commission</a> along with a <a href=""https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/content/visa-calculator_en"" rel=""noreferrer"">calculator</a>.</p>

<p>Also note that the new rules are in principle not applicable to citizens from the following countries: Antigua and Barbuda, The Bahamas, Barbados, Brazil, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Mauritius, and Seychelles. For these countries the old rules still apply because the visa waiver agreements still contain the older definition.</p>

<p>In any case, the rule always applies to a person. It does not matter if you have several passports, Schengen visas or nationalities.</p>

<p>I am curious, because in other places I lived (Switzerland, Singapore), tap water does not smell at all and chlorine smell is usually linked to swimming pools or decorative water fountains which carry a ""do not drink"" sign. </p>
","<p>My understanding is that chlorine, in the concentrations found in drinking water, does not pose an acute health danger. There may be health risks associated with long-term exposure, and this is a more controversial topic, where the literature and expert opinions are mixed. Most main-stream information seems to suggest it's safe, but the skeptics claim a corporate bias, etc.</p>

<p>Some of the long-term exposure risks reported are <a href=""http://www.triangularwave.com/f9.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cancer, heart trouble, and senility</a>.  Note that much of claimed risk is associated with long, hot showers, not drinking it.</p>

<p>If you're only visiting for a while, and don't have any known Chlorine sensitivities, you'll probably be just fine.  If the taste bothers you, or you're especially concerned about long-term health affects, drink bottled water.</p>

"What questions should I be able to answer when entering USA?","34599","","<p>Last time I entered USA, the border officer asked me a lot of questions. Some of them were quite personal and others were about my destination in the USA. For example, he asked me where I would stay. I knew the address and since it was a private host, he asked me if I know the profession of my host. I couldn't answer this question and the border officer seemed a little bit surprised about that.</p>

<p>So my question is: <strong>What questions should I be able to answer when I want to enter the USA?</strong></p>
","<p>One of the roles of the immigrations officials is to determine if you are wanting to enter the country for legitimate reasons, and for reasons that are within the rules of whatever class of visitor you are seeking to enter the country as (eg, a tourist, for business, for work, etc).  They are also trying to determine if you are likely to leave within the time allowed for your visa type, and that you are not involved in any way in some form of crime - including smuggling drugs or human trafficking.</p>

<p>With very few exceptions, they can basically ask you any questions they want to in order to determine if that is the case. From my experience of having passed through US immigrations over 30 times over the past few years, they generally have a few basic questions that they will always ask (""what are you here to do"", ""how long do you plan to stay"" type of thing), and then depending on the answers you give to those questions they will either accept your answer and let you in, or dig deeper into the details.</p>

<p>The fact that you might not be able to answer one or two questions completely isn't likely to be in itself a problem, as long as they are convinced that you're entering for legitimate reasons.  Not knowing the profession of your host would be expected if you were to say that you were doing a House Swap/found them on AirBNB/etc, however not being able to answer the same question would be very suspicious if you claimed they had been a friend for 20 years.</p>

<p>Other questions I've been asked over the years include everything from details on what attractions I was planning on seeing (when entering as a tourist), details on what I was going to learn (when entering for a training course/conference), details about the position I was applying for and where it was to be based (when entering for a job interview), and details about who I work for and what I do there (when entering on a work visa).  I've also been asked if I have any relations in the US, details of where I'm staying whilst I'm here, flight details for leaving the US, and even where I had come from, and what I was doing there.</p>

<p>Even if you do have issues with the initial immigration officer you will not be immediately rejected for entry, but instead will be taken to a ""secondary screening"" area where they will re-ask many of the same question, and potentially do further research to determine if you are legitimate or not.  eg, they might call you host and confirm that you are staying there and that the reason you don't know their profession is because you found them via AirBNB.</p>

<p>Which of the five villages can I get to by train from Genoa? (Apparently all of them have stations but some are only used by local trains within Cinque Terre.) Also, how often do the trains run, and what's the approximate price?</p>
","<p>From Genova (Piazza Principe or Brignole), take a regional train with the destination of <strong>La Spezia Centrale</strong>. There are direct trains to 3 of the 5 villages, so depending on your preference, buy a ticket to one of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Monterosso (northernmost)</li>
<li>Vernazza (2nd from north)</li>
<li>Riomaggiore (southernmost)</li>
</ul>

<p>But note that there are many more direct connections to <strong>Monterosso</strong> than to Vernazza and Riomaggiore.</p>

<p>To Monterosso travel time is 1h 45 min, and it costs 6.60€ (Nov 2012). Buy the ticket from the station; remember to stamp it on one of the Italian-flag-coloured devices near the platform before boarding the train. There's roughly one regional train per hour, from 04:53 until about 22:00.  </p>

<p>Here's an example of the timetable for one such regional train:

<p>Since it's a short trip I will be taking just the Tram 16, from the Central Station and the Keizersgracht. </p>

<p>Can I buy tickets that are valid for more than three days? </p>

<p>When do the tram start working? I know they run until 12:30pm but I don't know when they start?</p>
","<p>On my last visit to Amsterdam, I did not buy any ticket for the tram. I just entered the tram, asked the tram driver how much the fare was to the destination, and paid the fare directly (there is a small box where you can put the coins) and just alight at the destination. The price would be around 2.60 Euro for 1 hour trip. Means if you ride the tram 2 times within 1 hour, you don't need to pay for the second ride, as long as you can show the ticket as the proof.</p>

<p>For your question regarding tickets that last more than 3 days,  there is 24-, 48-, 72-, 96-, 120-, 144- and 168- hour <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OV_Chip_Card#Anonymous_OV-chipkaart/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">anonymous OV-chipcards</a>.

"Why do countries require validity of 6 months for passports?","33873","","<p>Many countries require a passport to be valid for six months. Sometimes these six months are counted from the date of departure, or from the date of entrance. Even though some of these countries only legally allow you to stay for 30 days or three months. What is the reason such a requirement is in place in many countries?</p>
","<p>When it boils down to it, provided all your travel plans go well, it may not be a problem.</p>

<p>The 6 month limit is possibly a bit long these days, and indeed <a href=""http://www.uspassporthelpguide.com/six-months-validity-rule/"">only some countries insist on it</a>, but it's there, and it's there for when things go wrong.</p>

<p>Every country is trying to get tourists (well, maybe not Saudi Arabia), but to not break the law.  You're only allowed into a country with a valid, legal passport, and sometimes a valid visa.</p>

<p>Now, if your passport is expired, suddenly you have an unlawful situation.  Your own country effectively says your document is not a valid document.  So now said foreign country has someone without a valid document.  How do they get you home? Unless you're neighbours, and can just pop across the border, it's now nearly impossible to leave the foreign country, as you'd have to travel through another country which won't accept an illegal document.  <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/jun/20/passport-expiry-dates-blank-pages"">Indeed, some European countries allow you to return using just a national id card</a>.</p>

<p>Airlines, if they let you travel without a valid visa/passport, are made to bring you back at their own expense. So they won't want to take you either.  Indeed for Australia, it's not mandatory that you have the six months, but <a href=""http://www.germany.embassy.gov.au/beln/faqs.html"">they warn you that some airlines enforce it, nonetheless</a>.</p>

<p>So now that we have a reason to not allow people to have their passports expire while in the country, why six months? If I'm there for 2 days, and the expiry is 6 months later, why should they care?</p>

<p>Caution.</p>

<p>First, a lot of the countries that have these limits, offer six month visas. Meaning you could stay right up to the day of departure.  So that's one reason. </p>

<p>Now, every day that you get closer to departure risks you having an invalid passport if you overstay even a day.</p>

<p>So for most countries, just having an arbitrary limit aims to prevent this issue.  If you're suddenly in a car accident and can't fly out, or, heck, even if your flight is delayed a couple of days, it's best for all involved that nobody's passport expire as a result.  Otherwise, legally you become an overstayer, and by law they'd have to deport you, which could be tricky if you're ill.  Imagine the situation where you're stricken with, say, swine flu, your passport has now expired, and you get deported. On top of this, you're also considered an overstayer, which will be on your permanent record, and in some the case of some countries will almost certainly preclude you from returning.</p>

<p>Not every country has this six month limit. Many just <a href=""http://www.wordtravels.com/forum/discussion/1580/x"">require you have a valid passport while there</a>. NZ and a few other countries <a href=""http://www.wordtravels.com/forum/discussion/1580/x"">enforce a 3 month rule</a>, although apparently <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/jun/20/passport-expiry-dates-blank-pages"">for people from the UK, NZ states that you only need a month free</a> after your visa ends. Each country deals with this in a different way, but the 'six month rule' is common and simple for all involved to understand.</p>

"Can you travel to Canada by road with an expired US passport?","33620","","<p>Is it possible to leave and re-enter the US through the land border with Canada with an expired (US) passport? My passport expired in December and I didn't realize that until now. In addition to the expired passport, I have my naturalization certificate and Tennessee issued drivers license to prove citizenship and residency. Re-entry will be by road from Canada.</p>

<p>UPDATE: 
I made some calls and was told that I needed a passport -- I was told to contact the regional passport agency in New Orleans (about 6 hours by road for me) get an appointment and show up in person with proof of imminent travel outside the country. After searching on the web, I located a few agencies who claimed that they could help with this for a charge of around $199. I picked the one that had good reviews and they helped take care of the problem. On Monday they walked me through different documents they needed, asked me to go to a ""Passport Verification"" agent in a post office to get everything verified and sealed in an envelope, had to FedEx the package to them. On Tuesday they got it, processed the passport and shipped it back to me. I got it Wednesday. In all it cost me $170 (Govt Passport Fee) + $25 (Verification fee at the post office) + $199 (Agency charge) + $90 (Shipping). Glad i got this taken care of. Thanks to everyone who helped with responses. </p>
","<p>As a US citizen you can not be denied entry to the US.  It is possible that you will be subject to additional scrutiny when entering, and additional checks to confirm that your passport is legitimate, but otherwise you will be fine.</p>

<p>If you were entering the US by air then the answer would likely be different.  Although technically you are still able to enter using an expired passport, it's very possible the airline would refuse to allow you to fly. As you are entering by car this will obviously not be a problem.</p>

<p>Update: The <a href=""http://acrosstheborder.wordpress.com/2009/06/19/answer-to-question-about-passport-requirements-at-the-border/"">Across the Border</a> blog contains a quote from a named spokesman at US CBP that states :</p>

"Are there ways to call ""international"" toll-free phone numbers?","33347","","<p>I just had a lot of grief changing a plane ticket from a somewhat exotic location.</p>

<p>It involved calling with Skype from Tbilisi Georgia to the nearest office for my airline in Istanbul Turkey.</p>

<p>It turned out the office's booking system for the airline was having some trouble but he told me I could call the airline direct on a toll-free number. He assured me it would work even though I didn't expect such things to work internationally.</p>

<p>I tried using Skype and I tried using a Georgian mobile phone. I couldn't get either to work.</p>

<p>So that's the back story. The actual question is <strong>Is there a way to call ""international"" toll-free phone numbers?</strong></p>

<p>The reason for the scare quotes on ""international"" is because it's a vague term. It may mean either of these things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Something like <strong>800 / 0 800 / 1 800</strong> numbers that can be called from any country.</li>
<li>Toll-free number in country A that can be called even if you're in country B. In which case you'd need to use the country code as well as the <strong>800 / 0 800 / 1 800</strong> part somehow.</li>
</ul>
","<h1>Generally</h1>

<p>The simple answer is: you can't...from a normal phone. Toll-free numbers are specific to the phone exchange system of a particular country and thus when calling from a VOIP phone provider like Skype or calling from a different country's network the call won't get routed through correctly. Your alternative to insist on asking for the version of the toll-free number with an international dialling code. In most cases, toll-free numbers are simply forwarding call internally with a phone exchange and by changing the prefix, you get the real number. In the UK for instance we have <a href=""http://www.saynoto0870.com/"">Say No To 0870</a> which provides listings of direct numbers.</p>

<h1>North America</h1>

<p>A more complicated answer is that for countries under the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Numbering_Plan"">North American Numbering Plan (NANP) Agreement</a> such as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Numbering_Plan#NANP_countries_and_territories"">USA, Canada and handful of other countries</a> they all have a common numbering system and toll-free calls <em>will</em> be supported. This may or may not always work depending on whether the toll-free number owner allows such calls: see <a href=""http://www.howtocallabroad.com/qa/toll-free.html"">this guide on international toll-free calling</a>.</p>

<h1>Skype</h1>

<p><a href=""https://support.skype.com/en-us/faq/FA24/How-do-I-dial-toll-free-numbers-for-example-1-800-1-866-and-1-877-number-series"">For selected few countries, Skype does support free calls to toll-free numbers</a>. This covers US and UK among major countries, which should cover a wide range of financial, airline, and travel assistance numbers.

"How much cash am I supposed to prepay at gas station in the US?","33333","","<p>In the US (and probably Canada as well), it is possible to pay at a gas station either with a credit card often with a fee (in the US) or cash. If I pay cash, gas stations often require to prepay for the gas.</p>

<p>However, I always wonder how much I should prepay. I suppose that people owning a car know how much filling the tank is worth. But I do not own a car and sometimes rent a car to visit the US, and each car has different fuel consumption. I usually estimate how much 100km is worth in terms of fuel and prepay close to the estimated amount and it just works.</p>

<p>But what is the expected behaviour? Am I supposed not to fill my tank entirely every time? Can I prepay a large amount and ask for the difference between what I prepaid and what I filled? Could I pay a way larger amount when i don't know (when the oil price is low, prepaying 40 or 60 USD might be seen as way too much). This question might sound a bit weird or obvious to some, but every time I rent a car I am wondering what the etiquette is.</p>
","<p>So, you should prepay for however much gas you intend to buy. In most cases, you'll probably want to either fill the gas tank, or just buy an amount of gas that corresponds to a nice round dollar amount like 20 dollars, to make the transaction quick and easy.</p>

<p>If you want to top off the tank, just prepay for an amount that you know exceeds the amount required to fill it, and then request change after the tank is topped off.</p>

<p>As to determining the amount required to fill the tank, well, you can generally guesstimate that with a fair degree of confidence just by looking at the gas gauge in your car. If it's at the halfway mark, you have room for half a tank of gas. The <em>vast</em> majority of cars in the US have gas tanks with a capacity between 12 and 20 gallons. (You'll see still higher capacities on trucks and SUV's). While you can get the exact number by checking the owners manual (on a rental, this can usually be found in the glove compartment), you can also figure this out pretty quickly the first time you fill up the car when it's low on gas. After that, it's a simple matter of multiplication of the gas price, times your (rough estimate) of the number of empty gallons you need filled. It's helpful to overestimate in this case, as, again, you can easily ask for change.</p>

","<p>Several things spring to mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>Paying for excess baggage (if needed) is sometimes cheaper online than in person, with some airlines</li>
<li>When you check in online, you can pick your seats, so you can get that sorted before everyone else does theirs at the airport (so you can often get better seats)</li>

<li>If your airline has a ""bag drop"" line at your origin airport, you may be able to arrive at the airport slightly later.</li>

","<p>As far as I know it's not possible for free, but you can buy a subscription to a tool like <a href=""http://www.kvstool.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">KVS</a> that can look up availability on any flight:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9aRYX.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The numbers in the ""Availability"" column represent free seats in each fare class: in this case, Business class (buckets J C D) on LH401 is wide open (9 or more seats), while the same flight codeshared as UA8840 has only 4 seats per bucket free.  As Doc points out, these don't map 1:1 to empty seats, but the general trends will be pretty obvious: all 0s is packed, all 9s is empty.</p>

"Place to store luggage for the day in Tokyo?","32829","","<p>I'm switching airports between Haneda and Narita over the course of 30 hours. As a result I have the day in Tokyo.  I'm likely sleeping in the airport, so don't have a hotel in town to store my bags at.</p>

<p>Any ideas on luggage storage? Eg the train stations to  the airports - would they have storage?</p>
","<p>The easy, safe and cheap option is <strong>train station lockers</strong>, which can be found at all major train stations in Tokyo (and Japan).  Japanese lockers are usually narrow but deep, so while hard plastic suitcases will not fit into them, backpacks are generally not a problem.  Some larger stations (eg. Tokyo stn) also have manned left luggage counters (手荷物預かり所 <em>nimotsu-azukari-dokoro</em>), which can handle any size of bag and only cost a bit more than lockers.  On station maps, these are usually shown with a ""bag-and-key"" icon, while lockers are ""bag-in-box-with-key"".</p>

<p>Which one to recommend, though, is going to depend on what you were going to do during your day in Tokyo and how you're planning to get around.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you're planning on exploring around <strong>Shibuya or Shinjuku</strong>, I'd take the Keikyu railway from Haneda and leave the bag at <strong>Shinagawa</strong>.  Shibuya and Shinjuku are a few stops away on the Yamanote line, and you can continue to Narita directly on the JR Narita Express (N'EX).</li>
<li>Alternatively, you can transfer from Shinagawa to Shibuya/Shinjuku with your bag, leave it at either station, and then take the N'EX.</li>
<li>If you're planning on exploring around <strong>Ueno and Asakusa</strong>, I'd take the monorail to Hamamatsucho, connect to Yamanote, and leave the bag at <strong>Ueno</strong>.  Ueno Park is walking distance, Asakusa is a few stops away on the Ginza Line, and you can continue to Narita directly on the Keisei Skyliner (premium) or Sky Access Limited Express (cheaper, slower).</li>
<li>You can also take the Keikyu line via Shinagawa directly to Asakusa, but this takes approximately forever and may require a transfer along the way.</li>
</ul>

<p>I probably would <em>not</em> recommend Tokyo station: it's huge, remarkably confusing, not terribly close to anything interesting (although naturally it's well connected to the entire city), and not super easy to get to from Haneda.  That said, there are <a href=""https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Tokyo_Narita_Airport#Keisei_Bus"">very cheap buses</a> from Tokyo stn to Narita, so if you're really pinching pennies it <em>might</em> be worth hassle.</p>

<p>One tip: when you do leave your bag, pay careful attention to where the locker is and how you got there, these are all massive stations and (voice of experience) it's no fun running around trying to figure out where the hell you left it...</p>

"Biometric passport: How can I know if the chip is still working? Does it matter?","32519","","<p>My biometric passport inadvertently spent some time under the rain. It's not badly damaged but some sheets are a bit deformed and there are tiny brown spots on the side. I am wondering if there is an easy way for me to determine if the chip is still working. If it does not, can I still use the passport? Which countries require a biometric passport or actually use the data?</p>

<p>Also, how much of a problem can a lightly damaged/worn out passport be? Is it more likely to be an issue in some countries than others?</p>

<p>PS: Right now, I am preparing for a possible trip to the US and since there is still time, I will most likely ask for a (<s>costly</s>, turned out requesting a new one was free, for some reason) new passport just in case but I would be curious to know if that's really necessary or about potential issues in other countries as well. The passport in question is still valid for more than three years, still has many free pages and was issued by a EU country whose citizens are eligible for the visa waiver program.</p>
","<p>ePassports use a ""Near Field Communication"" (NFC) chip to carry the biometric information.</p>

<p>Many modern smartphones include a NFC reader, which allows them to read the data from the e-Passport - if you can read that data, then your ePassport is working.  If you can't, then it's likely broken.</p>

<p>There are a number of apps that can read the data from the passport using NFC, such as <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.mroland.android.apps.nfctaginfo&amp;hl=en"">NFC TagInfo</a> for Android.  The information on the NFC chip is protected using a password composed of your passport number, data of birth, and passport expiry date so you will need to manually enter these before it is able to display the data from the NFC.</p>

<p>No countries are currently enforcing the use of ePassports for entry, so you will not have any issues getting through immigration with a ""failed"" e-passport.</p>

<p>In some countries, such as Australia (SmartGate) and the US (Global Entry), an ePassport is required to use the automated expedited entry lanes.  Without a working ePassport you will not be able to use these lanes, however at least in Australia you will be able to jump to the front of the normal lines if/when using the SmartGate fails.</p>

"Why prohibit engine braking?","32009","","<p>When I learned driving in The Netherlands (in a car with a manual gearbox), I learned that on a down slope¹, I should switch to low gear and use the engine to brake, thus reducing the wear on the brakes.

<p>The Jake Brake (or more properly the Jacobs brake) makes engine braking more efficient.  Normally a diesel gulps a full load of air (no throttle plates) and no fuel is injected when it is in engine braking. The engine consumes energy in the compression cycle but regains that energy in the expansion (normally power) cycle.  The Jake Brake prevents that regain, by opening the exhaust valve at the start of the power cycle instead of the end.  This instantly, and percussively, dumps a shot of 200-400 psi air directly out the exhaust stack. </p>

"Legalities and safety concerns of visiting prostitutes in Amsterdam","32008","","<p>A friend of mine left his girlfriend after a long (~5 years) relationship. To cheer him up a little bit, we decided to go to Amsterdam, as they have liberal prostitution and drug consuming laws. </p>

<p>We're planning to get him laid every day while over there. But we're not really used to bargain with hookers and assessing the quality. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/M7ilD.jpg"" alt=""red light block in Amsterdam""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rWSph.jpg"" alt=""neon lights of an entrance""></p>

<p>I have a set of important questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What price level are we talking about?</li>
<li>Is it considered rude to ask a hooker for references?</li>
<li>Is there a chance to get into trouble? How can I avoid that?</li>
<li>I also heard that there are a lot of illegal sex workers practicing in Amsterdam. How can I differentiate between the legal and the illegal hookers?</li>
<li>I really care for my friend, and don't want him to get any STDs or STIs. How common are they in Amsterdam?</li>
</ul>

<h1>EDIT</h1>

<p>I added a bounty to encourage everybody to share their wisdom about the prostitution business with me.</p>
","<p>Several non-authoritative points on the <a href=""http://www.amsterdam-red-light-district-maps.com/"">Amsterdam Red Light District</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Personal safety</strong>: most of Amsterdam (including the RLD) is generally busy and safe. Working girls normally rent the same room repeatedly, and are generally traceable in case of crime. Since prostitution is above-board, police are aware of common problems and ready to assist if necessary. The setup generally favors the provider, but as long as you behave well it's safe. Note that behaving well includes restraint in case you get of a bad session with a deceitful provider (which is common). Do not take photos in the RLD. While it's technically legal it would quickly get you into trouble with the pimps. Of course, if a provider agrees to photos (for an extra fee), then shoot away. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Legality</strong>: window prostitution in the Amsterdam RLD is legal and voluntary. As a customer, you don't need to care about immigration status, work permits and personal motivations of specific providers, that's the job for police and social workers. Obviously, some women who work there are happy with their choice of career, while others would prefer another job if their circumstances were different. Happy ones give better service. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Health concerns</strong>: condom use is universal, for all activities. Some STDs can be transmitted even when condom is used. Most providers are well-informed and take regular STD tests, although they are <strong>not</strong> mandatory. According to casual sources I read, STD incidence is low, but I could not find any authoritative studies. Risk of STDs is inherent to any sexual activity and real. However, they are usually vastly exaggerated by organizations with an agenda (especially in the USA). There is risk to every human activity, including crossing the street or riding a bicycle. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Procedure</strong>: always <strong>explicitly mention/negotiate everything</strong> that you expect from the provider, and get them to acknowledge it before entering the room. This includes things which seem obvious, like taking off all clothing, touching specific places, all sexual activities, any time limits, and of course, price. Make sure the provider agrees to everything in advance, once the door closes behind you, you're committed to the payment, no matter what the provider does. Many providers rely on you not being explicit during negotiation, and try to get you to pay more for various extras once you're in the room (including seemingly obvious ones like taking off a bra). It is a bad idea to pay for pesky upsells, since it encourages bad behavior -- after payment, the ripoff providers just bring on the next upsell, and never focus on satisfying the customer. If you encounter this, there's not much you can do except respect their boundaries (however silly) and stick to the basic service. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prices</strong>: as of 2011 in the RLD windows, prices are in the 30-50 EUR range for 1-shot (usually ~15 min), and up to 100 EUR for special services. This is somewhat negotiable, but usually not by much. As a general rule, you do not get better service for the higher price -- providers have a base rate and normally stick to it. Did I mention explicitly negotiating <em>everything</em> in advance? </p></li>
<li><p><strong>References</strong>: You can find reviews of some providers on internet <a href=""http://www.ignatzmice.com/"">forums</a>, and if you're extroverted you can sometimes ask the previous customer upon leaving whether the session was worthwhile. Not sure what asking the provider for references would accomplish. If they're out to cheat you, that inquiry is worthless, and if they're honest, it's unnecessary. </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Gratuitous tip</strong>: although Amsterdam is world-famous for the RLD, it is not a particularly good destination for commercial sex. FKK clubs in Germany and many spots in East Asia are far better when it comes to quality of the experience. </p>

"What's the best time to get ""last-minute"" discount hotel prices?","31540","","<p>Some online travel sites (I'm thinking of Hotwire specifically, but the question applies more generally) offer low rates on high-quality hotels if you're willing to not specify exactly where you want to stay. As I understand it, these rates are possible because the hotels would rather have a room occupied than not, even if they're making a minimal profit off it. So I would think, if you're using one of these sites like Hotwire, the cheapest hotel rate they can offer should get <em>lower</em> as you get closer to the date of travel. Is that actually the case?</p>

<p>In my case specifically, I will be attending an event in Boston in about a month. The lowest hotel prices I'm seeing close to the location of the event are around $200-250 right now, but I'm wondering whether those are likely to get any lower in the few days prior to the event itself. (I'm aware that there are other ways to find accommodation on a budget, but I'm just researching my options for now.)</p>
","<p>Hotels, like most travel services, work very much on a supply-and-demand basis.</p>

<p>If the demand is high, then prices will go up, and eventually hotels will sell out even at the higher prices.  If the demand is low, prices do sometimes come down over time - although frequently the hotels themselves will not want to drop their prices below a certain level, which is where opaque bookings like Hotwire/Priceline come in, selling the hotels excess inventory depending on how many free rooms they have.</p>

<p>Priceline/Hotwire prices definitely do vary significantly night-to-night for the same properly, based primarily on the hotels expected occupancy rates.  This means that as the date gets closer, the price may drop, but it may also rise or even not be available at all.</p>

<p>Depending on the size of the event you're attending it's even possible that it will have an impact on the number of rooms available - frequently it's difficult to find any rooms available in an area, let alone cheap rooms, if there is a major conference/sporting event/etc occurring at the time.  As the event gets closer, room availability gets lower, prices get higher, and opaque booking venders end up getting allocated zero rooms to sell!</p>

<p>If you must have a hotel, it's often a good idea to find somewhere with a good cancellation policy (eg, allowing you to cancel up until at least a day or two before the event) - this gives you the certainty of having somewhere to stay if prices go up, but also allows you to keep looking/bidding for cheaper rooms as the date gets closer.  If you find somewhere cheaper, simply cancel your initial reservation!</p>

"How do you know if Americans genuinely/literally mean what they say?","31506","","<p>I have come across a few situations when an American will say something like ""We should have lunch some time"" or ""Let's have lunch some time."" Or ""you should come down to visit me in D.C. (or Miami or wherever""); we have great museums (or Cuban food or whatever).""</p>

<p>It turns out though that more often than not they don't really mean it. Because if I then immediately follow up with ""Oh how about lunch tomorrow?"" or ""Oh will you be in Miami in early December? I could come by then."", they usually start getting evasive and awkward, and back out of what seemed like an invitation that they just made.</p>

<p>How can I tell when Americans genuinely/literally mean what they say, especially in the aforementioned situations? </p>

<p>Perhaps this is common not just to American culture but also to some other cultures across the world, but it was (and still is) very puzzling to me and I am still trying to figure it out.</p>
","<p>There is an <a href=""http://usaerklaert.wordpress.com/2006/09/18/warum-amerikaner-briten-kanadier-nicht-sagen-was-sie-meinen/"">essay</a> which explains the difference between ""polite"" and ""direct"" cultures. First of all: For members of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglosphere"">Anglosphere</a> like Americans, Britons and Canadians the Germans are using the term ""Angelsachsen"" (Anglo-Saxons) which is slightly different from the meaning in English, it especially has a more humorous connotation like ""Teuton"" for Germans. As it is used extensively in the original essay, the original author suggest the use of ""English speaker"" as translation, be aware of the difference. The essay describes the cultural difference between English speakers (polite) and Germans (direct) very well in German. I translated the essay with help from other people, especially the user Semicolon, because it seems to gather much interest.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Why Americans (Brits, Canadians) do not say what they mean</strong><br>
  <em>translated by Thorsten Siebenborn with permission</em><br>
  <em>of the original author Scot W. Stevenson, a German-American</em><br>
  ""Hey, how are you"" asks an American -- and is surprised when his German friend tells him that his pet ferret was killed by a car. ""Just come on over sometime!"" said the Briton and is aghast when the German sometime later really stands before his door. English speakers do not always mean what they say; Germans, in contrast, almost always do. If those two cultures come together, there are some more problems than just the handshake [Translator: Short addition to the essay: Germans shake hands and subconsciously slightly bow their head, Americans don't => Americans are arrogant, Germans are cute].</p>
  
  <p>Cultures from the Anglosphere are speaking with a cultural code which demands politeness. For example, it is considered crude to answer directly with ""no."" Therefore they use phrases that every other English speaker understands as ""no,"" yet do not mean ""no"". (Dear women: Some problems with ""no"" seem more influenced by gender than culture. I am sorry.)</p>
  
  <p>When a woman asks her best girlfriend if a specific dress fits her, should the friend be German she may answer with a grimace: ""You? Not really"" or ""I don't know if that really fits you."" An American woman would be more apt to answer, ""Wouldn't blue be a better fit to your eyes?"" -- which means you are looking like an anorexic scarecrow with a drug problem -- while a German girl asking would get the inkling that they are talking past each other. ""Eyes? Why is she blathering about my eyes? I want to know if my butt juts out!""</p>
  
  <p>Other examples: During a discussion with Americans, ""I wonder if this is really the best solution"" means ""no."" Likewise, ""I'm wondering if we need more time"" or ""we might want to review some parts of the project"" are also negative. Americans are perplexed (or simply angry) when Germans, after a short reflection, respond, ""Nope, it's ok"" and simply continue. From the American's point of view, the message was clear.</p>
  
  <p>The rules are valid for the daily routine, too. A polite Canadian won't tell you that he does not like a present because it seems to him to be indecent as it could hurt your feelings. And that is -- we are coming to the central point of the story -- in case of doubt, more important than the truth. For this reason he or she tells you -- if ever -- encoded in indirect language, and because the gift-giver is expected to know the code, he understands and everything remains polite. Not without good reason there exist the terms ""little white lie"" and ""polite lie,"" which are significantly weaker even than ""white lie"": these are culturally accepted, even culturally mandated lies.</p>
  
  <p>This prompts the question of how Britons &amp; co. react if they <em>really</em> like the present. In short: they freak out. ""Look, honey, I wanted this since I was seven, no, I mean, before I was born, wait until the neighbours see that, oh my goodness!"" There will be many, many, <em>many</em> thanks. This day will rest in his memory forever and he will tell his grandchildren about it and it will be chiseled on his tombstone, etc. If you are German and you begin to have the feeling that it's getting embarassing and you begin to suspect that your counterpart is pulling your leg, all was correct.</p>
  
  <p>While happy English speakers are a bit strenuous for Germans, the reverse situation is more serious. An American who gives a German a present is almost always crestfallen because Germans <em>never</em> flip out. In the codebook of an English speaker, a completely normal German ""Thank you very much"" is a sign that the present was not liked. The author needed to comfort several saddened English speaking compatriots coming back from a date with German woman: ""She didn't like my present! What did I do wrong? I don't understand."" Erm, no, she really liked it, but she is a German. They are that way. Marry her nonetheless.</p>
  
  <p>And now the part which may be uncomfortable for interested readers: The rules are still compulsory for English speakers in foreign countries. ""If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything"" has been hammered into their minds as children and so they will hold their tongue about anything negative during their time as a guest. Criticism as a guest is one of the most grievous offenses of politeness.</p>
  
  <p>For that reason it's impossible to find out what English speakers really think about Germany. If they are well-mannered, they will <em>always</em> say that it is wonderful. Amazing. Great! Any other response would be a catastrophic breach of manners on par with using the tablecloth as a handkerchief and chopsticks as cotton swabs.</p>
  
  <p>For Germans this is frustrating. After the guest has been in a new country for some time, the German would expect that there a things which their guest don't find to be as good as in their home country -- naturally. It's expected in Germany to mention such things ""honestly"" because it shows that you have a ""sophisticated"" opinion about the world and a cultivated and critical mind. People who find everything super, great and wonderful are considered dumb, gullible and superficial -- the last one is, not without reason, the leading German prejudice about Americans. From a certain American view it could be considered a compliment.</p>
  
  <p>Such cultural differences are known to most Germans in regards to countries like Japan, where ""no"" only exists in a dictionary because the communication police demand it. For unknown reasons they don't expect it from Britons and Americans. It's also not taught in English classes, which remains a complete mystery for the author. As an exercise I ask the reader to imagine normal German au pair pupils in London, New York or Ottawa. They will all be asked ""How did you like your stay?"" -- and every year, thousands of unsuspecting German children will run straight into the cultural knife.</p>
  
  <p>When Germans in frequent contact with English speakers become aware of the code, they're prone to panic. Every sentence and statement will be dissected: Does he mean it or is he polite? What do I do now? I want the codebook!</p>
  
  <p>You need to realize that you just won't know some things. A good host will always give the impression that life has changed a bit. If you cannot cope with that you need to follow their train of thoughts, put yourself in their position and trust your empathy. If you are guest, please spare your criticism for your diary and concentrate your honest praise on one point -- at least, as honest as possible. <em>It was different</em> means <em>it was terrible</em>, so you cannot escape easily.</p>
  
  <p>A rule of thumb is the principle I explained above -- behavior that looks like overstating is more than politeness (though be careful with Americans who live in Germany long enough and now know what to expect). There is a helpful ""three times rule"": If an English speaker tells you something three times (""Please come visit us again!"") or enough times that you are irritated, you can safely assume it is honest. One time means nothing.</p>
  
  <p>In the end you should know: No one expects a foreign guest to exhibit completely correct social behavior. Most Americans know that Germans are, erm, more ""direct"". If you don't mind fulfilling stereotypes, you have a certain leeway to handle things.</p>
  
  <p>If you know the rules or are at least aware of their existence, you could break them on purpose. The most beautiful German [Translator: His wife.] sometimes uses the introduction ""I am German, so I am sorry if this seems to be a direct question,"" which causes immediate blood freezing of every English speaker in hearing distance. <em>Ist der Ruf erst ruiniert...</em> [Translator: German idiomatic expression meaning that once your reputation is ruined, you can stop worrying about what other people think.]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He advises that in addition to Max's answer about necessary included information in your interaction that repeating it several times is an indicator of genuineness. Three times is almost binding; once is simple politeness.</p>

<p>Another thing is that in polite cultures real happiness and agreement are likely to look overstated in general. If the person in question does not change much from his usual politeness, it means nothing; if you get the impression that he/she is out of control for happiness, it really might mean ""Yes"".</p>

<p>He also added that if you ask for something where a negative answer contradicts politeness (""Did you really enjoy your holiday here?"") you won't get an honest answer and you really must look for empathy.</p>

<p>I will add some general information because the blog author is quite astounded that people in Western countries expect that other people in Western countries act the same. They do not.</p>

<p>People in more ""direct"" cultures like Netherlands, Germany or Russia are quite simple. Yes means Yes, No means No. As noone is expected to adjust his mood for other people, people are looking sad if they are sad and if they are happy they look happy.</p>

<p>What you are saying will be assumed to be true.<br>
If you as ""Anglo-Saxon"" say: ""Just come on over sometime!"" it means that you <em>literally invited people to visit you at home</em> !<br>
""Hidden"" No's are likely to remain unnoticed. A ""I wonder if this is really the best solution"" means ""I'm ok with that, but I think over if we can find a better solution later"". You will be ignored.</p>

<p>For people from more direct cultures it is quite vexing because you are operating outside cultural norms (which can be in fact very different in polite cultures) and if you know the difference you must always ask yourself: ""Does he/she mean it"" ?<br>
For people from polite cultures people from direct cultures appear to be rude, dismissive and obnoxious. A ""No, please redo this parts again"" which means in a direct culture ""Quite ok, but this part needs some polish"" is a <em>complete disgrace and dismissal</em> in a polite culture.</p>

"Can I put 3.4oz (100ml) of liquid in a larger bottle, when traveling in the US?","31107","","<p>Is the restriction on the amount of liquid in the container, or the size of the container itself?</p>

Basically, they're not going to measure everything out.  3.4oz (or 100ml for simpler numbers) - what if you have 98ml or 95ml? They don't have the time or the inclination to measure all to say 'yes you're under 100ml'. As a result, it'll be on the bottle size.</p>

"Tax refund at Narita airport in Japan","31008","","<p>I'm an Italian tourist, and I bought  things here in Japan.
Is it possible to have a tax refund at the airport? In particular I am interested in Narita airport.
In case it is possible to specify, what kind of commercial products are eligible? (E.g. electronics, clothes, food, etc.)</p>
","<p>Short answer: <strong>no, you can't claim tax back at the airport</strong>, you claim it from the store at the time of purchase. Eligible goods are everything except cosmetics, food, alcohol, cigarettes, medicine, film and batteries.</p>

<p>Long answer: Typically you obtain this discount <em>directly from the store where you purchased the item</em>, at the time of purchase, <em>if</em> they offer that service. </p>

<p>For example, Yodobashi Camera in Akihabara offers the full 5% off if you show your passport. However, many stores, and almost all smaller stores, do not offer 'duty free' shopping. An example of this is Yodobashi Camera in Chiba City (east of Tokyo). As it's not a 'tourist destination' they don't offer tax-free shopping.</p>

<p>As a general rule - if it's a tourist area, and a big store, then you'll probably get the discount. Otherwise, it's unlikely.</p>

<p>Furthermore, you must spend a minimum of 10,001 JPY in one transaction.</p>

"Does flying east to west generally take longer than west to east in America?","31001","","<p>I noticed for a particular round-trip that the portion from the east coast to the west was scheduled to take over an hour longer than the return trip.  I initially thought this was a mistake due to time zone or daylight-savings time oddities, but that does not appear to be the case.</p>

<p>I know there are a number of variables that can affect flight time (type of jet, winds, even potentially rotation of the Earth itself), so I was wondering if this sort of thing is typical.  This particular instance happens to use the same model plane for both trips and is non-stop, so most factors seem to be controlled for aside from east-west vs. west-east.  Is the longer flight a good candidate to arrive early (or is the shorter flight a good candidate to arrive late)?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I recognize from <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/q/5601/307"">this question</a> that winds are likely to be the dominant factor, but that still does not answer my question.  I'm specifically asking about the USA and I don't know what sorts of winds are typical (or whether or not it depends largely on southwest vs. northwest, etc.).</p>
","<p>As <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/5601/does-the-rotation-of-the-earth-affect-the-travel-time-from-europe-to-australia/5602#5602"">Mark Mayo's</a> answer shows, wind is the primary determinant of the difference in speed.  </p>

<p>The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_stream"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">jet stream</a> is a prevailing wind that typically is going somewhere over the United States, and runs typically from the West Coast to the East Coast.  As such, there is a prevailing headwind (-mph) going east to west and a prevailing tailwind (+mph) going west to east.</p>

<p>The path of the jet stream is highly variable (its usually shown on weather maps, because it is the primary determinant of weather), but can be usually thought of as a U shaped curve that on average goes from say, Oregon, south to Texas, and back up to say, Pennsylvania.  How deep it goes, and how far north or south it is on any given day, can be off by several states.  That's also why flight times can vary so much from the printed value.</p>

"Trains between Tbilisi and Batumi","30967","","<p>How to get by train from Tbilisi to Batumi (on the Black Sea coast)? There should be trains, but the <a href=""http://www.railway.ge/?web=1&amp;action=page&amp;p_id=479&amp;lang=eng"">""Traffic General Schedule""</a> on Georgian Railway's site does not mention Batumi (except for a Batumi-Ozurgeti commuter train).</p>

<p>How are the trains like? Are there sleeping cars and are they comfortable?</p>
","<p>Take the train to <strong>Makhinjauri</strong> (also transcribed <em>Makhindjauri</em>) - that's the closest passenger station to Batumi. (Though you can just as well ask for a ticket to Batumi.) </p>

<p>There's currently one <strong>night train</strong> every day, which <strong>departs Tbilisi at 22.45</strong> and <strong>arrives at 7.25</strong> (the one from Batumi to Tbilisi leaves at 22:25). So the travel time is <strong>8h 40min</strong>. The train makes <em>lots</em> of stops all night long (like ~20).</p>

<p>There's also one <strong>daytime train</strong> (each way) daily, which is a lot faster, <strong>5h 15min</strong>. (It leaves at 8.30 from Tbilisi and at 17.55 from Batumi, if I read the <a href=""http://www.railway.ge/?web=1&amp;action=page&amp;p_id=479&amp;lang=eng"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">railway.ge schedule</a> correctly; I haven't tried this train myself.)</p>

<p>First class (sleeper) ticket in the night train costs <strong>40 GEL</strong> (20 €); you'll share a cabin with one other passenger. (Second class is just <strong>23 GEL</strong>, but I don't know what that's like.) Buying the ticket early may be a good idea to secure a sleeper. Make sure to have your passport with you!</p>

<p><a href=""http://g.co/maps/a9ju3"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Tbilisi station</a> is easily reachable by metro (<strong>Station Square</strong> aka <strong>Sadguris Moedani</strong> aka <strong>Vagzlis Moedani</strong>) or taxi. Do reserve some extra time, however, if you don't know the station beforehand; it's not huge, but the platforms aren't marked very clearly.</p>

<p>The Makhinjauri station is some 5 km north from central Batumi, but it's easy to continue to that direction once the train arrives. A bus cost me 1 GEL (I took #10 which goes through Batumi centre but doesn't terminate there), and a taxi could be around 10 GEL depending on your haggling etc. There will be taxi drivers offering their services right when you get off the train.</p>

<p>The 1st class sleeper is not <em>that</em> comfortable (I'd say it's good Soviet Union level), but most likely you'll get some sleep. (Though according to the Georgian businessman I shared the cabin with, ""there's no comfort in our trains"" and he never sleeps well there.) <strong>Earplugs are a must</strong> to provide partial relief from 1) noise the train makes (sometimes really loud) 2) laughter, TV or general rowdiness in the car 3) your cabin partner's possible snoring. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/J6TJp.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""><br>
<sup>1st class sleeping berth. Photo by me, May 2012.</sup></p>

<p>As for safety, it generally seemed safe to me, though I guess how safe you feel depends on who you happen to share the small cabin with. There's a conductor / guard in every wagon (who, <a href=""http://wikitravel.org/en/Batumi#By_train"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">according to Wikitravel</a>, ""protects the passengers from drunks""). In my case she was friendly and had good attitude (though I'm not sure if she did much about the noise some passengers made after midnight). NB: the Wikitravel article suggests female solo travellers should consider booking both berths of a 1st class cabin, just in case.</p>

<p>So, this can be a cool experience especially if you like trains, but the <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/5932/what-time-do-buses-and-or-marshrutkas-leave-from-tbilisi-for-batumi"">bus/minibus option</a> definitely has its strong points too (it's cheaper and takes just 4-6h (?), with many more daily departures, and nice views daytime, I've heard).</p>

"Is it ok to bring a mirror onto an international airplane (US - POL)","30629","","<p>I am leaving to poland in a few days. I wonder if its ok to bring a mirror onto an airplane. 
If so what are the dimensions that are allowed?? </p>

<p>The flight is from US to Poland through Germany </p>
","<p>If you are talking about a personal mirror like the one ladies carry in their purses, then it's fine. But if you are talking about a large mirror like the ones to be hanged on the wall, then it's a different story.</p>

<p>My day-to-day job is about this kind of things. There is nothing clear regarding Glass or Mirrors. For example, Glass bottles are totally fine, while the airplane's mirrors are made of a non-glass based material. Considering the aviation safety textbooks as the source, the only things that can restrict you from bringing your mirror on board are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sharp edges. Mirrors are not mentioned specifically but in general most sharp items are not allowed.</li>
<li>Dimensions. Maximum allowed length for most airlines is 45 linear inches (the total of the height, width, and depth of the bag). Anything larger should be checked. </li>
<li>Weight. The heavier the item is, the more dangerous it is if it falls from the overhead compartments in case of turbulence or incidents. Most airlines have a limit for carry-on luggage but it's different from one airline to another.</li>
</ul>

<p>A personal advice to you is, do not bring it on board, the chances of having the mirror broken are not much greater if you check it in rather than take it on board. Plus I do not think the airport security and/or the airline staff will allow you to carry it even if there is nothing in the books to prohibit mirrors explicitly. Personally, if I was operating on that flight, I would definitely ask the ground staff to offload it because I have seen what real turbulence would do and the last thing I would want to see is pieces of glass flying all over the cabin.</p>

<p>To check it in, put it in a foam box or something similar, stick that <em>fragile</em> sticker and hopefully it will make it. Or just buy a new mirror in Poland ;)</p>

<p>There are a few different ways to get TSA Pre - each with it's own restrictions.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You can get access via your airline, particularly if you're a frequent flyer.

You do <strong>NOT</strong> need to be a US Citizen or Permanent Resident to get access this way (historically you technically did need to be, but it wasn't well enforced, and this restriction has recently been removed).</p></li>
<li><p>You can get access via Global Entry, SENTRI, or NEXUS.  These are programs generally designed for frequent travellers to make crossing specific borders (specifically the US/Canadian border) easier. Some non-US Citizens are able to join these programs, especially Canadian citizens. You do <strong>NOT</strong> need to be a US Citizen or Permanent Resident to get access this way, however access is only available to citizens from a very small list of countries.</p></li>
<li><p>You can get access via the <a href=""http://www.tsa.gov/tsa-precheck/application-program"" rel=""noreferrer"">TSA Pre Application Program</a>, where you basically pay a fee to be screened and then given access to Pre. Currently you <strong>DO</strong> need to be a US Citizen or Permanent Resident to get access via this means.</p></li>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I buy a ring in the US, put it in my bag and do not declare the ring I am smuggling jewelry? How is that different from buying the ring, wearing it round my neck on a chain (or on my own finger for that matter) and not declaring it? Am I supposed to declare my own jewelry that I already paid for (including taxes upon purchase)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, what is the verdict on this? smuggling or not? And is it a difference whether it's on a finger, on a neck chain, or in a box in the carry-on?</p>
","<p>You're generally not supposed to declare the stuff you already paid for and imported legally but you might be required to prove you did not buy them abroad, otherwise the regular import rules apply.</p>

<p>The details will depend on the specific country and a few other things (e.g. whether you are a resident, currently moving to the country, etc.) but you are typically allowed to import things worth between USD 500 to 1000, for your personal use, if you carry them with you. In all the counties I know a little about, this allowance cannot be shared between several people to import a more expensive item.</p>

<p>Anything over that value is typically going to be dutiable (there are very complex rules on how much duty you have to pay on what type of goods) and taxable (including VAT in countries that have it).</p>

<p>Now, the question becomes: What about the stuff you take with you on your trips? Between the Apple laptop from last year, the new iPhone, the designer clothes and your Swiss watch, you're already over USD 500. In practice, if it's all regular <em>used</em> tourist gear, customs officers do not bother. From the perspective of the country you are visiting, you will take everything back with you soon and aren't importing anything for good. From the perspective of the country you come from, it has probably all been properly imported and taxed before.</p>

<p>Being too picky about those things would mean expending considerable resources for a limited return and would put an unreasonable burden on either citizens or the tourists that come to spend money in the country so it seems reasonable to tolerate it. Because of this, if you throw your old watch or go to Switzerland without one, buy a new watch there, mail the receipt and come back with the watch on your wrist, you might just get away with it. But you are still supposed to comply with customs rules both in the countries you are visiting and the country you reside in and the burden of proof might really be on you.</p>

<p>If you want to do everything by the book and avoid paying duties on goods in transit or used during a short visit, you should secure some evidence that the goods have been properly imported (to be able to reenter the country you initially left), provide some guarantee that you will reexport them soon (to be able to enter the country you are visiting without paying the full importation costs) or follow some temporary exportation/importation procedures. For expensive equipment or perhaps a car, customs might just bother and I know people who had such paperwork for their gear. Among other things, that's what the <em>ATA carnet</em> and the <em>carnet de passages en douane</em> are for.</p>

<p>As a random example, here is what <a href=""http://www.cbsa.gc.ca/publications/dm-md/d2/d2-6-5-eng.html"">the rules in Canada</a> look like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li><p>Canadian residents may temporarily export personal effects for use on trips abroad.</p></li>
  <li><p>On returning to Canada, it is the individual’ s responsibility to establish that such items were initially taken out of Canada and were not acquired abroad. </p></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>So formally it's really up to you to prove you imported the ring properly, even if you bought it a long time ago and wear it all the time. And jewellery appears to be especially sensitive:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol start=""10"">
  <li><p>Most jewellery items, with the exception of watches having serial numbers and original pieces of jewellery that are numbered by the manufacturer, are not uniquely identifiable. Since the Y38-1 label is unsuitable for use with items such as jewellery, individuals taking valuable pieces of jewellery or other similarly non-identifiable articles abroad should be aware that the CBSA will not document such goods on Form Y38. If an individual wishes to take steps to avoid unnecessary delays and facilitate reimportation of these articles, an appraisal report should be obtained from a qualified gemmologist, jeweller, or insurance appraiser, together with a signed and dated photograph of the jewellery. This should be accompanied by written certification that the jewellery in the photograph is the same jewellery identified in the appraisal reports. Individuals should be aware that this appraisal documentation may be expensive to obtain.</p></li>
  <li><p>Jewellery is a sensitive commodity given special attention during CBSA clearance. Individuals who are unable or unwilling to obtain documentation should consider leaving such jewellery in Canada to avoid problems when they return.</p></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Failing that, you could be asked to pay duties or even a penalty upon coming back to the country. The customs do not even have to prove you bought the ring abroad, you have to prove you did buy or import it in Canada earlier.</p>

"A day at Dubai International Airport and the city?","29899","","<p>On my way to India I'm planning to stay one day in Dubai. I would arrive at 6am in the morning and leave at 3am the next day.</p>

<p>My naive plan is to lock my backpack at the airport and then walk into the city and around to see some of the architecture and then return to the airport in the evening.</p>

<p>So, two questions? Are there lockers or left luggage facilities at the airport? Is it possible to walk to/from the airport and in Dubai itself.</p>

<p>Is it worth spending more than a day, if I just want to look around a bit?</p>
","<p>Um. You might want to start by investing in a guidebook or at least flicking through <a href=""http://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Dubai"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikivoyage Dubai</a>.</p>

<p>The airport and the ""city"" (such as it is, Dubai is hugely sprawling) are most definitely not within walking distance; however, they are connected by the Dubai Metro, which will whisk you there in a few minutes.  The only bit of the city that is really walkable is the souq in the ""old"" Dubai, next to Al Ras metro station, and you can always take an abra (ferry) across or down the creek.  That said, Dubai is <em>brutally hot</em> for most of the year, so walking around is not feasible if you're there in summer or anywhere near it.</p>

<p>Yes, there is a <a href=""http://www.emirates.com/english/plan_book/essential_information/baggages/baggage_services_dubai.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">left luggage facility</a> at the airport, in each of the terminals in fact.  The airport is ridiculously huge and you can while away hours there quite easily, especially if you're even slightly into shopping.</p>

<p>And as for if it's worth spending more than a day, the answer is ""it depends"".  Do you like shopping in insanely huge shopping malls, resort hotels, and artificial attractions like the world's tallest building, theme parks, aquariums, and indoor ski slopes?  Then the answer is ""Yes"".  But otherwise, probably not, especially if you don't know anybody who can take you around and if you're on a backpacker budget.</p>

<p>Also, where would be the best place to look for package deals (airfare, hotel, etc). for this sort of trip? </p>
","<p>There's no simple answer to this because flight prices vary according to time of the year. Flight costs are probably going to be the highest, and while it is not the only indicator, a lower flight price indicates an 'off-season'. If you try <a href=""http://www.kayak.com/explore/"">Kayak's Explore feature</a> (set your airport to Seattle) then it does indeed seem that cheapest flights in March 2013 would be for Hawaii. However, costs are also likely to be more in Hawaii - so you could also consider a host of Carribbean / Central American countries that may be slightly more expensive as far as flights go but have cheaper hotels. Besides, you didn't really mention a budget, whether you're going with a family, etc - all factors that can vary the price.</p>

"Travelling to the US with codeine-based medicines","29393","","<p>I'm travelling to the US next month, and I'd like to take my codeine-based painkillers with me. In the UK these are available without a prescription, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-counter_drug#United_Kingdom"" rel=""nofollow"">over the counter</a> from a pharmacist. (It isn't just available in any old supermarket like some painkillers, but can just be sold in a pharmacy under supervision from the pharmacist, no Doctor involved)</p>

<p>I see from <a href=""https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/67/kw/prescription%20medicine"" rel=""nofollow"">this CBP advice</a> that <em>prescription</em> medication must have a prescription label attached, but presumably this applies to medicines that are only available on prescription in the US.  So my question is twofold:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can I bring my codeine-based painkillers to the US without a prescription?</li>
<li>More generally, is there a list of medicines that are commonly available in other parts of the world but restricted in the US?</li>
</ul>
","<p>If you really would rather be safe than sorry, you should follow the advice on the page you linked to, as it is advice I've followed in the past:</p>

<p><strong>A valid prescription or doctors note is required on all medication entering the U.S.</strong></p>

<p>Now practically we all know that's not really the case.  Bringing in paracetamol/tylenol, or Imodium, or asthma medicines, etc, are generally waved right through.  However many countries, including the U.S. as documented, technically require that documentation for <strong>all</strong> medicines so they have recourse for suspicious circumstances.</p>

<p>In the case of any medicines you're not sure about, it's definitely worth obtaining a doctor's note - it doesn't have to be a prescription, as a letter from your doctor should suffice.  If you really must bring in your codeine-based medicines, it seems like a simple and sensible step to take.</p>

<p>The CBP give similar and more extensive advice on <a href=""http://www.cbp.gov/travel/international-visitors/kbyg/prohibited-restricted"">another page</a>, which would presumably cover codeine under ""potentially addictive drugs/narcotics"":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you need medicines that contain potentially addictive drugs or
  narcotics (e.g., some cough medicines, tranquilizers, sleeping pills,
  antidepressants or stimulants), do the following:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>Declare all drugs,
  medicinals, and similar products to the appropriate CBP official; </p></li>
  <li><p>Carry such substances in their original containers;</p></li>
  <li>Carry only the
  quantity of such substances that a person with that condition (e.g.,
  chronic pain) would normally carry for his/her personal use; and </li>
  <li><strong>Carry a prescription or written statement from your physician that
  the substances are being used under a doctor's supervision and that

"Why does the TSA allow two 3-ounce containers but not one 6-ounce container?","29374","","<p>If I understand the TSA's <a href=""http://www.tsa.gov/311"">3-1-1 policy</a> in the US correctly, you are allowed to take two 3-ounce containers of a liquid on a plane, but not a single 6-ounce container of the same liquid. Is this really how the policy works? If so, what was the rationale for regulating carry-ons like this?</p>
","<p>When you're making rules like this, <strong>simplicity</strong> and <strong>objectivity</strong> are vital. You don't want (whether you're a traveller, a supervisor of the security staff, or a person trying to prevent terrorism) a situation where security staff need to make decisions on their feet based on whether the passenger's story is good enough or any other kind of judgement call. Hmm, you have shampoo and conditioner, well yes your hair is quite long, you may pass. Oh my, you are almost completely bald, why would you need conditioner, we're confiscating this, and so on. </p>

<p>Travellers want to be confident their stuff won't be banned. Staff need to be able to do their jobs as <strong>quickly and consistently</strong> as possible. And the person who made the rules needs to be sure they will always be enforced as imagined. That's why you can't bring 50 ml of stuff in a 600 ml bottle. Reading the label and seeing that it says 600 ml is <strong>simple, unambiguous and consistent</strong>. It works even if the security staff are not that bright. And there's no need for a complicated appeal process. Someone else reads the label and says yup, 600 ml, this is a no-go. There's no argument about whether you have 80 ml left in the bottle or 120 ml left in the bottle. The rule is just about the bottle.</p>

<p>Your little bottles are each under 100ml and all fit in the baggie of freedom? You're free to go. Nobody stops to say hey, each of these bottles appears to have the very same stuff in it. That would require judgement. The volumes - the 100 ml and the dimensions of the baggie of freedom - have been chosen so that even if you brought 6 or 7 bottles (whatever can fit) of the maximum allowed size all of the same stuff, you wouldn't be able to do much damage. (And really, checking that they are all labelled as different things wouldn't do much - we can all make labels.) Also, if you used larger sub-bottles - say 200 ml - you could get more total volume into the baggie, so using small sub-bottles is another way of constraining the total volume.</p>

<p>Designing a very simple and consistent system <strong>makes the checking faster</strong>. It lets people bring shampoo, conditioner, lotion, toothpaste, shaving cream etc. And it was set up so that it still constrains the bad guys. Sort of. It's not that hard to circumvent, in reality, since there are exemptions for things that are labelled (eg saline solution, prescription medication) and tremendous trust in labels. But it's all tradeoffs, and this certainly makes people feel protected. It even has some effect. Nothing is 100%, but the liquid-reducing measures do mean that more conspirators would be required for most terror acts, and more conspirators means more chances to catch them before they even get to the airport. </p>

"Can I eat a beef burger in India?","29346","","<p>I always heard that cows are holy in India. So I assumed that you can't eat any meat made of cows in India. But recently a friend told me, that it depends on the region. Not everywhere in India cows are holy. Is this true? This friend also told me that even if cows are holy, you can eat them.</p>

<p>So my other questions are: If a cow is considered holy, can I order something like a beef burger in a restaurant? Will I get into trouble if I eat something like that in public?</p>
","<p>Cows are considered holy in Hindu religion, not India as a whole per se. North/East/West India are primarily Hindu-majority regions and thus you're highly unlikely to find any beef, except perhaps at dodgy places in Muslim-dominated parts of those towns. Dodgy places because in those three parts of India cow slaughter is frowned upon and you don't find organised slaughterhouses for cows.</p>

<p>While Southern India has its own conservative Hindu population which do not eat beef, it also has proportionally higher numbers of Christians and Muslims - historically because Christianity was brought in by sea traders. Beef is not as uncommon in South India and you will certainly find it <em>some</em> restaurant menu (typically ones that are not under a Hindu owner's management). This is generally in upscale restaurants or hotels bars with a significant foreign visitor clientèle.</p>

<p>You'll never find beef products in chain restaurants such as McDonald's, Pizza Hut, Domino's etc. (For instance, there's no Big Mac burger in Indian McDonald's restaurants; instead, they have a '<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Mac#Variants"">Maharaja Mac</a>' which is about the same size but with chicken patties.) Chain restaurants across India are primarily owned by a handful of companies based in North India. This was somewhat of <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1312774.stm"">a big issue in 2001 when rumours spread that beef fat was used in making French fries</a>. You might come across signs in restaurants to this day which state 'Beef and beef products not sold here'.</p>

<p>Since the availablity of beef is so restricted, I can't think of how you'd end up eating it in a public place. Nevertheless, it isn't illegal and if you do acquire beef then you can cook it in your own home too.</p>

<p>What I'm interested to know is if I had to fly out at short notice, say within 1-2 days, then am I better off booking within that 1-2 day gap online, or am I better off trying my luck directly at the airport (as long as I'm willing to wait at the airport) for a cheaper price? Is there any truth to rumours that airlines sell tickets at cheaper prices at the airport right before flights to fill empty seats or is that a myth?</p>
","<p>I might contribute some inside knowledge since I am working for a company which contributed the software for a major cheap-flight company. </p>

<p>Generally the prices are determined by offer and the demand BUT there is another major variable (in fact several) in the game for short-booking. Statistics show that most (80%) last-minute bookers are in an important need for the short booking and therefore willing to pay more. So the function which generates the price for short-bookings is not a complete function of offer and demand any more like it was years ago.</p>

<p>If you want to know what's the deal do the following: Go to your online bookers homepage. Search for a flight which is taking off today and try to book that ticket. With this you firstly know how short you can book online and secondly if the prices are acceptable for you. </p>

<p>Your question is also highly location dependant. In the country I live (Switzerland) I get the cheapest flights through a friend who works at the airport and calls me when a certain flight is available. I can only recommend trying both the online and physical approach.</p>

"I have discovered that the hotel room toilet is blocked, but too late. What should I do?","29203","","<p>Ok, I have used the toilet after holding myself for too long because of a long haul flight and I am not comfortable using the airplane's lavatory. The problem is, after releasing all the damn load, I have discovered that the bloody toilet is blocked, flushing makes things float! The hotel is a 5 stars hotel. </p>

<p>What to do now? I know I can call the house keeping/reception and let them handle this sh1# (literally), but I find this so humiliating to me and to whomever unlucky person who is assigned to handle this. Any advice?</p>
","<h1>If the flush mechanism doesn't work</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>Flush manually:</p>

<p>In fact in many developing countries or even elsewhere such as out in the bush you can find modern toilets without running water.</p>

<p>All you need to do is find a large container, fill at as full as you can manage, and pour it into the bowl.  The faster you poor and from the greater height the better. But start slow and low because if you are too aggressive you can cause icky splashing.</p></li>
<li><p>The mechanism is often easy to fix:</p>

<p>Take the lid off the cistern. Be careful if it's ceramic it will be heavy. You can break it or your toe if you drop it.</p>

<p>There is usually a string, wire, or chain connecting some kind of lever, float, and rubber seal. Often this gets caught on something causing the plug not to reach the seal or not to close it fully.</p>

<p>Sometimes the string, wire, or chain has come loose from one end and can be reattached without any special tools.</p>

<p>Sometimes it can help to bend the arm the float is attached to for fine adjustments if the plug almost reaches the seal but not quite.</p></li>
</ol>

<h1>If the bowl is blocked</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>See if there is a plunger near the toilet or in a cupboard. If your 5-star hotel has a kitchenette and there's a plunger there but not in the toilet, then maybe throw it away after cleaning up, or at least leave it in the toilet room.</p></li>
<li><p>If there is no plunger to be found then the ""manual flush"" method above may be stronger than the built-in flush if you can drop in a lot of water at once from a great enough height without making a mess.  This is much safer in ""low water"" toilets than with the ""high water"" toilets typically found in North America.</p></li>
<li><p>Let it soak and come back from time to time when the water level has gone down and flush again. Again be careful with ""high water"" toilets as in North America - they are notorious for overflowing in such conditions. If you are a man, aim your stream at the obstacle each time you go. This will break it up. These techniques are hampered if you used too much toilet paper.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are in a country where you don't know the language, get online and look up the local words for ""hardware store"" and ""plunger"". In my experience the latter can be quite tricky. I was in this situation once in Berlin, found at least half a dozen words for ""plunger"", most of which must've been regional words only known to people in other parts of the German-speaking world! I also couldn't find a hardware store and couldn't find a plunger in a discount store. (Lidl style or 1-euro-shop style)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>DO NOT USE DRANO!!</strong> Caustic pipe un-blocking products are not intended for use with toilets. They can melt the wax used to seal the ceramic toilet to the pipes. You can create a far worse situation this way. (Non-caustic products should be fine though.)</p></li>
</ol>

<h1>If all else fails</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>You can use this situation to work on your problems of finding natural bodily functions embarrassing. Go tell somebody working at the hotel. If it's a 5-star hotel they specialize in being discreet about far far worse things their guests might do.</p></li>
<li><p>If you cannot bring yourself to overcome this personality defect then you can leave an apology note somewhere the housekeepers will find it before finding the surprise you left them. You can even include a tip.</p></li>
<li><p>The housekeepers have definitely dealt with this situation and much worse before. If you just leave it they are pretty used to that.</p></li>

<p>I strongly suspect you will probably never find out what these mean as the purposes of these fields are most likely classified.

These are based on various sections of the Code of Federal Regulations.</p>

<p>In the case of issuing nonimmigrant visas, this is covered by <a href=""http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/87503.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">9 FAM 41.113</a>, which tells consular officers how to issue a visa in accordance with the regulations at <a href=""https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/22/41.113"" rel=""noreferrer"">22 CFR 41.113</a>. The relevant section is the very first one:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h1>9 FAM 41.113 PN1 INFORMATION ABOUT THE MACHINE READABLE VISA (MRV)</h1>
  
  <p>The information on the MRV is printed on an adhesive foil and consists
  of five sections that:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>Reflect the applicant’s biographic data;</li>
  <li>Contain information about the visa itself (visa type, number of entries, date of issuance, and date of expiration);</li>
  <li>Show the 88-character field used for annotating additional information about the recipient, when necessary; (e.g., annotation of
  a petition number, SEVIS number, etc.);</li>
  <li>Display a digitized photo of the visa recipient; and</li>
  <li>Contain a machine-readable zone (MRZ) consisting of two lines of highly sensitive coded data. Scanners connected to authorized computer
  networks can read the data located in the MRZ and instantly recall
  records associated with the MRV. Damage to either line may prevent the
  scanner from reading the data, requiring manual data-entry before
  processing, which could lead to delays at ports of entry. You should
  instruct MRV recipients to take care with their MRVs, avoiding folding
  the foil, and preventing contact between the foil and objects that
  could damage it, such as paper clips, staples, etc.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that no mention is made here, or anywhere else in <em>the unclassified parts of</em> 9 FAM, about the asterisks or the four-digit number. Those parts of the visa do not appear to be relevant to whether the visa holder is of any particular concern to US authorities. In particular, it does not appear to indicate that the visa holder poses any particular level of ""risk"". This also appears to be the <a href=""http://www.justanswer.com/immigration-law/6vwe8-parents-in-law-received-visa-usa-promptly.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">opinion of various immigration lawyers</a>.</p>

<p>After reading a lot of <em>other</em> sections of 9 FAM and 22 CFR, and some versions at archive.org going back to before 2000, I am pretty well convinced that while these features do serve a purpose, that purpose is classified and appears only in a classified section of 9 FAM, if at all.</p>

<p>One last thing I can tell you for sure is that the four digit number <em>is not binary</em>. Numerous examples can be seen on Google Images of visas with four-digit numbers containing <a href=""http://www.inmigracionpuertorico.com/visasyresidencia/local%20images/VISA%20SAMPLE.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">digits other than 0 or 1</a>, though these appear to be far less common.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> In case the connecting flight is missed. On a ticket which is non refundable (non - everything - as this was the cheapest ticket), what happens when one misses a connection? Whose responsibility are the next steps? What should be the next steps? Reading other questions about AMS, with 50 minutes, it seems that the luggage is sure to be delayed. Sigh.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2</strong> It's been a while, but when I was transiting, 50 minutes was pretty ample enough.</p>
","<p>50 minutes is doable, especially since airlines tend to arrive ahead of time these days. In case you miss your connecting flight it is good to know your <a href=""http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/passenger-rights/air/"">rights</a>. Since, KLM and delta are in the same alliance, I woudn't worry. If you miss your connecting flight, you will most probably get the next flight without additional costs. </p>

"Will getting a refund from an ESTA scam site cause me to be blacklisted from the US?","28836","","<p>A colleague accidentally purchased a US ESTA from a scam site that I won't dignify with a link, charging him $31.  (<a href=""https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta/"">The official site</a> charges just $14.)  Like most scam sites, the site actually did get him an ESTA, they just took a fat cut.</p>

<p>He'd like to request a refund (the site promises they have a 30-day refund policy), get his money back and try again via the official site, but the <a href=""http://canberra.usembassy.gov/esta_scam.html"">US Embassy in Australia</a> says:</p>

<p><strong>Update for clarity</strong>: The discussion of whether this is legally fraud or not is beside the point.  This question is asking whether the act of requesting a refund can really stop you from being able to use ESTA in the future.</p>

  <p>If the company you used to submit the ESTA cancels the fee with ESTA
  after you cancel the charge with them this will create a charge back.</p>
  
  <p>If you were charged more than $14 USD per application, you have gone
  to a third party web site. A third party business charges a fee to
  submit an ESTA application on your behalf to the official website.
  These businesses and web sites requesting additional fees are not
  endorsed by, associated with, or affiliated in any way with Department
  of Homeland Security or the United States Government. If there is a

  your statement.</p>
  
  <p>However, please keep in mind that any payment stoppage to the ESTA
  application fee payment transaction with your bank or credit card that
  may inadvertently result in a withdrawal of the fee for any of your
  previous ESTA applications - will cause an automatic denial of your
  current ESTA. The account will then be posted as a ""chargeback” and
  incomplete account. This means that you will NO LONGER be able to
  re-apply for a new ESTA and all subsequent ESTA applications will be
  denied.</p>
  
  <p>You can continue to monitor the application up until the date of
  travel to see if it continues to be approved. If you wish to apply for
  a new ESTA to feel at ease you can also do this; the decision is

"At JFK, can you move between terminals airside on domestic flights?","28807","","<p>When arriving at JFK (or any US airport) on an international flight that didn't have pre-clearance, I know that you have to clear immigration, collect your bags, clear customs, re-drop bags, change terminals by AirTrain if needed, and then go through security, no matter what terminals are involved. </p>

<p>I also know that when you fly into JFK on a domestic or pre-cleared flight, and your onward flight is from that same terminal, you just step off your domestic flight into the departures area and walk to your onward gate, without needing to do security again.</p>

<p>At some other big US airports I've been to before (eg DFW), there is an airside transfer train that lets you move between terminals, so you can go from gate to gate without needing to exit + re-clear security. However, at JFK the only transfer train I'm aware of is AirTrain, which is landside.</p>

<p>Is it possible to move between terminals at JFK from within the airside / departures area? Or is the only option when changing between domestic flights at different terminals to exit, take the air-train, then queue up and re-clear security?</p>
","<p>No.  The only way to get from one terminal to another is to exit the terminal and take the air train or a shuttle bus.</p>

<p>A possible exception to this is for Delta, which operates in Terminals 2 and 4.  They apparently have a bus that connects the airside areas of these terminals.  See the map here: <a href=""http://www.delta.com/content/www/en_US/traveling-with-us/airports-and-aircraft/airports/new-york-jfk.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.delta.com/content/www/en_US/traveling-with-us/airports-and-aircraft/airports/new-york-jfk.html</a></p>

"What does a technical stop mean in air travel?","28738","","<p>When I look at my flight itinerary, it says that the flight includes a technical stop.<br>
What does that mean compared to a layover?</p>
","<p>Usually it's a refuelling stop, and you just sit on the plane. You don't go into the terminal, the plane isn't cleaned, and you're soon on your way again. As an added bonus, the airline isn't charged for using the terminal, so the tickets are sometimes cheaper as a result.</p>

<p><em>Edit</em></p>

<p>After some reading of forums, the whole leaving the plane thing is possible depending on airline or terminal.</p>

<p>In addition, another type of technical stop is where for example you have a fuel leak or engine failure and have to land to get it sorted.  However these are usually (obviously) unplanned, so the fact it's on your itinerary means it's likely the former (fuel stop).</p>

You might not depart exactly from Washington DC, but I will assume elsewhere along the US east coast should be fine as well — the travel from DC to the starting point of the ocean journey will be much less than the time for the rest of the journey, anyway.

"How often can you visit on a multiple-entry pass to Singapore?","28432","","<p>I have multiple entry visit pass of Singapore valid for 2 year and normally they allow to stay for 30 days in a single visit. How many times I can do this if go out to my home country and come back again after 7 days? Is there any limitation on this ? Because it seems holder of the visit pass can stay in Singapore for more than 1.5 year if he/she use visit pass in this way.If we go by words it is multiple entry visa but, is it legal to do this or is it considered illegal? </p>
","<p>Visas are issued for a specific purpose, and the type and duration of the visa issued are based on the purpose that you requested it for.</p>

<p>The actual conditions described on the visa form one part of the conditions and intent behind the visa, but they are not the only conditions that apply.</p>

<p>So in this case, the conditions on the visa are that you can stay for up to 30 days on each visit, and can have multiple visits.  However such a visa would not have been issued with the intent that you could basically live in the country - if that was the expected intent then a different type of visa would have been issues.</p>

<p>Why this matters is related to one of the most misunderstood areas of visa - a visa does NOT give you the right to enter a country, even if you are fully applying by the conditions of the visa (stated conditions or otherwise).  At the end of the day, the immigration officials at the border always have the last say as to whether you will be allowed into the country.  If they believe that your visa has been obtained fraudulently (including mis-representing the time you intended to stay in the country), if they believe that you are not entering the country in line with the terms of your visa, if they believe you are entering the country to commit a crime, or for any other reason, they can deny you entry to the country at the border.</p>

<p>So whilst you may have a visa that states multiple entries up to 30 days, each time you re-enter the country the immigration official will look at your history of entries/exits from the country, and after a number of 30 days in/7 days out entries they will almost certainly begin to suspect that you are breaking the conditions of the visa - they might think that you are in the country to work, that you are residing there, or any number of other things that would be against the conditions of that type of visa.  They might even simply suspect (correctly!) that your repeated short trips outside of the country are ""visa runs"" (trips with a sole purpose of extending visa validity) which are generally covered in immigration laws as not being allowed.</p>

<p>The second time you enter the country odds are this won't be a problem.  But sometime after that - well before you make it even close to the 1 year mark - someone is going to spot the pattern, and put you on a plane back where you came from.  Nobody is going to be able to tell you if that's going to occur on the 3rd visit or the 10th as it will depending on a number of factors including the exact type of visa, the particular immigration official, the answers you give to the questions they ask you, and countless other things - but it will happen eventually.</p>

<p>Immigration law is something it's best not to test the limits off. The results (ranging from cancellation of a visa to be banned from entry to a country for up to 10 years or more) just isn't worth the risk!</p>

"How to determine if I'll be switching planes during a layover?","28375","","<p>I'm looking at a potential flight with a short layover (1hr 10 min).  How can I determine if I'll be staying on the same plane or switching planes during the layover?  Is there something in the flight description that lets me know there's no switch?  Or do I have to call the airline to learn this?</p>

<p>I prefer to avoid very short layovers, but a short layover on a flight I'm already on is fine.</p>
","<p>Short answer: if both flights have the same flight number, you are probably staying on the same plane. If the flight number changes, you are connecting to a different aircraft.</p>

<p>Alternate answer: if the airline told you what city you are changing in and told you what time you land and take off in that city, you are connecting to a different aircraft. In the circumstance where you are staying on the same aircraft, they usually just tell you that your plane will be making a stop, without telling you where or when.</p>

<p>This is true 97% of the time. Rarely, the airline messes around with flight numbers, sometimes to disguise a connection as a direct flight, and this rule doesn't hold.</p>

","<p>British Airways uses a standard 3.5mm port in all classes; you should be fine to bring your own headphones. <strong>[edit]</strong> However, I always include in my travel electronics kit an airline headphone adapter, which allows you to use your headphones' single 3.5mm stereo jack with the double 3.5mm mono ports found on some equipment, including older BA aircraft.</p>

"How do I redeem airline vouchers when booking through a website?","28170","","<p>So, I got bumped from a United flight a while back (last April to be exact, so I'm nearing the one year mark).  As part of the voluntary bump, I got a $400 voucher to be used towards purchasing another United flight.</p>

<p>I'm used to booking through Expedia or Orbitz, and just plugging in my credit card details.</p>

<p>The question is, how do I use these vouchers? Do I have to use United's site directly? (And will I be able to get the same rates?)  Or, is it possible to book through a third party and still pay with that voucher?</p>
","<p><strong>UPDATE: The type of vouchers mentioned in this question no longer exist, and thus this question and all answers for it are no longer relevant to any vouchers that anyone may have!</strong></p>

<p>It sounds like what you've got is a ""Type B"" voucher.  You should have 5 or 6 pieces of paper - one covering terms and conditions, (possibly) one with a summary, and then 4 vouchers, each of which is for $100 giving a total of $400.  On each of the vouchers it should state ""Treat as Type B Voucher"".</p>

<p>""Type B"" vouchers are basically able to be used as payment for any United/United Express/Continental flight.  This is different to many other United vouchers (aka ""E-Certificates"") which give a ""discount"" on the fare, rather than being treated as payment for the normal fare.</p>

<p>You can use one or more of the $100 vouchers on a single booking, although you will not receive any credit for using only part of a voucher.  eg, if your flight cost is $280, you can give them 2x $100 vouchers and pay $80, or you can give them 3x $100 vouchers but you will lose the additional $20.</p>

<p>Unfortunately you can't book flights with ""Type B"" vouchers online - you need to go via the United call center.  If you're a Mileage Plus member you can reach them at the number on your card (which may take you to a dedicated reservations center, depending on your status).  If you're not a MP member, you can call 1-800-UNITED-1 (aka 1-800-864-8331).</p>

<p>Note that there is NO charge for a phone booking when using a voucher!  Normally you would be charged to book over the phone, but they will waive this when booking with a voucher. Depending on the agent you get it's possibly they will try and charge you a fee - if they do, just remind them that you are using a ""paper voucher"" and they will remove the fee.</p>

<p>Once you've booked your ticket the booking will be placed on hold until you pay for it by getting the voucher(s) to United.  You can do this by either mailing the vouchers to United (I'd suggest registered mail, just in case!) or you can take the vouchers to a United ticket counter at any airport.</p>

<p>Personally I'd suggest going to the airport - it may cost you a little more, but it gives you the piece of mind of knowing that the vouchers aren't going to get lost.  If your flights are less than 2 weeks away this is the only option they will offer you.</p>

The tour information recommends changing some money into Euros and Swiss Francs before we go. Is there any reason why it might be particularly important to obtain Swiss Francs? Are ATMs particularly rare or are in country exchange rates particularly bad?</p>
","<p>From <a href=""http://wikitravel.org/en/Switzerland#Buy"">Wikitravel</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Switzerland is not part of the European Union and the currency is the
  Swiss franc (or Franken or franco, depending in which language area
  you are), divided into 100 centimes, Rappen or centesimi. However,
  many places - such as supermarkets, restaurants, sightseeings' box
  offices, hotels and the railways or ticket machines - accept Euro and
  will give you change in Swiss Francs or in Euro if they have it in
  cash. A check or a price-label contain prices both in francs and in
  Euro. Usually in such cases the exchange-rate comply with official
  exchange-rate, but if it differs you will be notified in advance.
  <strong>Changing some money to Swiss Francs (CHF) is essential.</strong> Money can be exchanged at all train stations and most banks throughout the
  country.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Switzerland is more cash-oriented than most other European countries.</strong> It is not unusual to see bills being paid by cash, even
  Fr 200 and Fr 1000 notes. Some establishments (but fewer than before)
  do not accept credit cards so check first. When doing credit card
  payments, carefully review the information printed on the receipt
  (details on this can be found in the ""Stay Safe"" section below). All
  ATMs accept foreign cards, getting cash should not be a problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As they mention, there are ATMs everywhere, which is what I did when I went - I simply drew cash on arrival.  I do this in all my travels - it's convenient, and only 'failed' in Buenos Aires where one of the airport ATMs was down, and in Uzbekistan (Khiva) where only one bank in town could let you draw money from my card type, and there were no ATMs.</p>

<p>If that are my only requirements, which of the three cities should I choose to go to?</p>
","<p>Ottawa we can pretty safely drop from the list -- as a planned city populated mostly by government bureaucrats, it's got a few good museums but very little else to interest the casual visitor, and it's quite hard to get around without a car.</p>

<p>Montreal vs Toronto is a more interesting showdown.  Personally, I'd cast my vote for Montreal: it feels a bit smaller and more approachable, with an incredibly vibrant cultural scene, and the presence of French everywhere gives it quite a unique flavor for a North American city.  However, if you're keen on something that's less ""European"" and more like New York or Chicago, then Toronto may fit the bill better.</p>

"How do carpool lanes in the US work?","27899","","<p>I'm doing some research for our roadtrip through SW USA (+Calif.) and ran into ""carpool lanes"" and this came to my attention: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hopefully if you're not travelling alone, you will be allowed to
  drive through carpool lanes that help go past single-occupancy
  traffic</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since we're travelling with 2 (and part of the trip with 4), is it safe to say I can always use the carpool lanes? If more than 2 (e.g. 3) persons are required, is there a clear traffic sign that states this or do I have to know the rules in each state/city by heart?</p>

<p>I also found that 2 freeways in LA County (I-10 and I-110) were converted to <a href=""http://www.infowars.com/carpool-lanes-in-los-angeles-turned-into-toll-roads/"">toll roads</a> and require RFID transponders. I suppose a rented car doesn't have a transponder? Is it made clear by any sign that you need a transponder?</p>
","<p>At the entrance of a carpool lane, a sign always indicates how many people are required in each vehicle to be eligible, since situations sometimes vary.</p>

<p>The sign can say ""CARPOOL ONLY - 2 OR MORE PERSONS PER VEHICLE""</p>

<p>In Los Angeles area, nearly all carpool lanes have a minimum of 2 passengers.</p>

<p>I only have seen one case in which three passengers were required. At the time of my visit in 2009, the freeway heading east of Union Station to El Monte had passenger requirements that depended on the time and day of week. In normal hours, 2 passengers were enough; in weekday posted rush hour times, the requirement was 3 passengers.</p>

<p>Be careful in the area : now, there is a new system called <a href=""https://www.metroexpresslanes.net/"">ExpressLanes</a> running on I-10 and I-110 freeways. The concept is that people not eligible to enter the lane may buy their way in by paying a congestion-priced toll, instead of getting a fine. Toll collection happens electronically, and uses a compulsory transponder. Legitimate carpoolers who used to simply drive through the lane are now required to have the transponder on ExpressLanes, even if no toll is charged for them. The transponder has a switch to indicate the number of occupants.</p>

<p>Other freeways still have the ""classic"" carpool lanes.</p>

"Should I tip at ""full serve"" gas stations?","27867","","<p>The other day in North America I went through a gas station that offered both self-serve pumps and ""full-serve"" pumps (someone will fill your tank). I expected to help myself but I accidentally stopped at a pump where someone served me. </p>

<p>I have been wondering after this whether I should tip this employee. If that happens again, what is customary? </p>
","<p>Tipping a filling station attendant is <strong>not <em>generally</em> expected</strong> in the United States or Canada. Some guides <a href=""http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/alpha-consumer/2008/01/07/the-new-rules-of-tipping"">flatly deny</a> it is ever expected, though others <a href=""http://magazine.foxnews.com/at-home/12-confusing-tipping-situations-solved"">acknowledge</a> there is <a href=""http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2006/10/12/basic-tips-on-tipping-how-much-and-to-whom/"">disagreement</a> on the matter. </p>

<p>Anecdotally, in all the times I've been in Oregon and New Jersey, I have <em>never</em> seen or heard of anyone tipping the attendant simply for pumping gas, except to leave them the change when paying cash (I have not used a full-serve pump anywhere else in the US or Canada in over 20 years, and cannot even think of where to find one).</p>

<hr>

<p>Fifty years ago, a good attendant might have checked your oil and coolant levels, wiped the windshield, and checked your tire pressure in addition to filling the tank. An increase in electronic sensors and decrease in drivers' patience over the years means such attention is rare today. In most places, ""full serve"" is not really full service, and simply the term used to indicate that an attendant is working the pump.</p>

<p>With that noted, except where banned by local ordinance, attended stations charge a higher price, which is understood to cover the wages of the attendant for the basic work of filling the tank and collecting payment. Moreover, unlike a food server or barber, or even barista, there is very little social interaction with the attendant, and tipping usually accompanies more intimate or longer-term interactions. As an etiquette columnist wrote for a <a href=""https://www.bostonglobe.com/magazine/2014/08/02/everyday-advice-you-tip-full-service-gas-stations/5HcsYk75Zgf13HrdbURLFN/story.html""><em>Boston Globe</em> ""Miss Conduct"" column</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tipping is customary only if there are both full-serve and self-serve options at the station and the fuel is priced the same at both. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This would exclude areas where self-serve is banned altogether (including the entire states of New Jersey and Oregon), which is borne out by anecdote— the only people who tip in New Jersey are <a href=""http://articles.latimes.com/2012/nov/06/nation/la-na-nn-new-jersey-gas-lines-20121106"">out-of-towners</a>. </p>

<p>But when extra service <em>is</em> rendered, some tipping may be in order— various guides suggest $1–2 for cleaning the windshields, and at least $5 for any work involving getting on the ground or checking under the hood. As <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/Business/tip-awkward-situations/story?id=22874520"">etiquette authorities</a> will note, tipping someone working in a service job is <strong>always appreciated, and never <em>impolite</em></strong>. Pumping gas is a monotonous, fume-infused job which is at best unpleasant, so I would give some consideration particularly when the weather is hot, cold, or wet.</p>

"Schengen Visa Refusal: Justification for the purpose and conditions of the intended stay was not reliable","27844","","<p>Schengen refusal formulae can be difficult to understand sometimes.</p>

<p>Sometimes an applicant receives a refusal with:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Justification for the purpose and conditions of the intended stay was not reliable.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>often accompanied by:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your intention to leave the territory of the Member States before the expiry of the visa applied for could not be ascertained.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is meant by this refusal reason?  What are they trying to say?</p>
","<h1>Visa Refusal and Reliability of Applicant</h1>

<p>When a Schengen refusal notice contains...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The information submitted regarding justification for the purpose and conditions of the intended stay was not reliable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...it means the decision-maker has concluded that the application contains serious problems.  This is arguably the most severe refusal reason in the Schengen repertoire; many times when they use this reason it will be accompanied by the final reason...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your intention to leave the territory of the Member States before the expiry of the visa applied for could not be ascertained.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To reduce these two reasons to blunt and direct English, it means <strong>We have concluded that you are not a genuine applicant and we do not trust you</strong>.  This can arise in several ways...  </p>

<h2>Impacts Arising From History</h2>

<p>If your sponsor has a history of sponsoring people who have breached the terms of their visa (like overstaying or working illegally) then this is taken into account against you and your sponsor's evidence may be treated as unreliable. </p>

<p>If you have a history of breach (like overstaying), or did not tell them about a change of circumstances, such as a significant change in your travel itinerary, then it's reasonable for them to assume that your fresh evidence is not reliable.</p>

<h2>Credibility of Evidence</h2>

<p>If the relationship between you and your sponsor is too distant or cannot be adequately explained, and they cannot understand why your sponsor is willing to commit themselves on your behalf, then his/her evidence will be discounted as unreliable.  Make sure that your evidence demonstrates that there is a clear and strong relationship between you and your sponsor.</p>

<p>If you are relying upon a sponsor you met on the internet and they are providing assurances for your financial well-being, and the only evidence you can provide to prove a strong relation is a Skype log or chat room log, it will almost certainly be seen as unreliable. </p>

<p>If your sponsor is making attestations about your intentions, or other third parties are making similar attestations, these will usually be discounted as not reliable.  There is very little evidence to show that third parties will turn someone over to the authorities if they are in breach.  Moreover, many such attestations contain promises that cannot be enforced.  These are considered to be unreliable evidence.  Some countries provide the host with a legally binding instrument having to do with sponsorship, but these have to do with financial capacity and not with an applicant's intentions.</p>

<h2>Lack of Evidence or Poor Evidence Quality</h2>

<p>This is very common.  If your evidence is low quality or insufficient, they may conclude that it is unreliable.  Examples of this can be a single bank statement such that they cannot get a 'big picture' understanding of your circumstances.</p>

<p>Also common are bank statements with irregular and unexplained flows in and out of the account. See ""<a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/39153/uk-visa-refusal-provenance-of-funds-parking/39158#39158"">Funds Parking</a>"" for an example (although the link points to a UK case, it is wholly applicable to Schengen).</p>

<p>Young applicants who are just starting out as international travellers may have problems getting the quality of evidence needed to show that they are sufficiently anchored to their family and community.  When this happens the evidence they produce is sketchy and not well documented, hence unreliable.  If you are young and just starting out as an independent  traveller, you may not have accrued enough high quality evidence to prove that you have a durable connection to your family and community. This is especially true if you have not yet established an independent life. </p>

<p>Applicants who are unemployed or otherwise in reduced circumstances will have a very difficult time producing reliable evidence.  These applicants will rely on their sponsor's evidence and are best advised to focus on producing high quality evidence that they occupy an established position in their community and have significant family relationships to maintain.</p>

<p>Falling in to this same category are documents without a date or dated too long ago to be of any use in determining the applicant's current circumstances.</p>

<h2>Forged or Counterfeit Documents</h2>

<p>This can happen when an applicant wants to strengthen their application or to fill an evidential shortfall. To do this the applicant will find a service that provides <em>made to order evidence</em> such as...</p>

<ul>
<li>salary slips</li>
<li>bank statements</li>
<li>utility bills</li>
<li>travel confirmations</li>
</ul>

<p>These often fail when a visa assistant verifies them. When this happens, the evidence (if not the entire application) will be assessed as unreliable.  Remember that if you know about a way to procure counterfeit evidence, they do too.    </p>

<h1>What can I do now?</h1>

<p>When an application fails due to ""<em>The information submitted regarding justification for the purpose and conditions of the intended stay was not reliable</em>."", the first step is to examine each piece of evidence you submitted with a view to separating high quality evidence from low quality evidence.</p>

<p>If the low quality evidence consists of a single document that can easily be replaced with something more substantial, then it may be expedient to make a fresh application with the new evidence.</p>

<p>If there's more than one or two low quality documents, it may make sense to wait until your circumstances improve.</p>

<h2>Can I send a letter of protest?</h2>

<p>Yes. You can send them an explanation of why they made a wrong decision and ask them to reverse it locally. It's unlikely to help very much, but sometimes it may work.  To do this, you can compose a letter to the relevant issuing post (including a translation) and send it by post or fax.  </p>

<p>Some refused applicants may feel the need to go ""straight to the top"" and complain directly to the ministerial office in the host country. These complaints will be routed back to the issuing post for comment and so the results will be unchanged but further delayed by the bureaucratic overhead. Unless the issuing post has solicited a bribe, it's best to keep things at the local level. A history of specious complaints can damage your credibility.</p>

<h2>Can I appeal?</h2>

<p>Yes, for more information see <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/52725/schengen-visa-refusal-does-it-make-sense-to-appeal/52728#52728"">this answer</a>.  </p>

<h2>None of these apply to you</h2>

<p>If you have read this article and think that none of the information applies to your case, then the best strategy is to contact a practitioner licensed in the EU to engage with Schengen applicants. They will be able to examine your evidence along with your personal circumstances and help determine what went wrong.</p>

","<p>Tap water is always drinkable in Italy, especially in the cities (of course, it may be a little bit different if you are talking about a cottage in the middle of nowhere).</p>

<p>The real question is how good is that. For instance, in Rome the water has a very strong percentage of limestone and it taste doesn't very good. For this reason, several people tends to buy a water purifier or a simple purifier container like the following one.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CNO0l.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Talking about Milano, and big cities in general, it depends on where you live (how far from the main water collector, the quality of the pipes, etc). My suggestion is to either try, ask the neighbours or use a water quality test to check the quality of the water in the apartment.</p>

<p>In any case, it's potable. So you can drink it, or use it for a tea or coffee. It may not taste extremely well or the amount of mineral salt may be greater than what you would expect.</p>

<p><br/>
<strong>Quick Update</strong><br>
I'll be shipping from wherever is the cheapest option in Europe (mainland) and shipping to the cheapest option in Canada or the U.S.</p>

<p><br/>
<strong>Extra Information</strong><br>
Many people suggested buying a car in either Canada or Alaska. But that does not answer the question I was asking : ) The car has some very nice base characteristics (very small, very good off-road ability, cheap) and in addition has special modifications for long range independent travel (such as, but not limited to, extended fuel- and water tanks) and in addition, I know this car's history so I can make an informed estimate about it's reliability. <em>So, I've decided to bring this car</em>. The question is now, what's the best/cheapest option to ship it.</p>

<p>I will likely <em>not</em> re-register the car in the U.S. nor Canada. I've heard from several travellers that it increases hassle if your car is registered in a different country than you live in, so, for now, the plan is to keep the car registered in my home country.</p>

","<p>So, to answer my own questions</p>

<p><strong>Has anybody shipped a car between Europe and Canada or the U.S.?</strong><br>
It seems to be quite common to ship cars between Europe and the either the U.S. or Canada.</p>

<p>There basically are three options for shipping a privately owned car:</p>

<ul>
<li>Let an international moving company ship the car (and whatever else you want moved) for you. International moving companies tend to do it all for you. You just let them know what needs moving from where to where and they will sort out all the details for you.<br>
The downside of this is, of course, the cost of the whole opperation.</li>
<li>Shipping your car with a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roll-on/roll-off"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RORO</a>-ship. There are several shipping companies that offer RORO services. Most companies also offer transportation to and from the harbor, if required.<br>
This option is quite convenient and cheaper than the international movers. But.. you cannot ship any additional gear, just the car, as you are not allowed to put bags or boxes into the car.</li>
<li>Shipping by Less-Container*. With this option, your car is stuffed in a freight container, together with other freight. The good thing about this option is that you <em>can</em> ship extra gear inside your car. The downside is that it <em>may</em> take longer to ship your vehicle (the container will only be shipped with a full load) but prices are more or less equal to the RORO option.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What kind of cost am I looking at?</strong><br>
I did not look into the price of having the car shipped by an international mover, as they where clearly the more expensive option. Shipping your car by RORO and Less-Container is calculated by either length of your vehicle or, in some cases, weight of the vehicle. To give you an indication, I was quoted prices between € 1,000 and € 1,200 for my 3.75 m long car.</p>

<p><strong>Any gotchas I need to know about?</strong><br>
The paperwork when you get there. It should pose no extraordinary problem getting the vehicle admitted to the country for up to one year, as long as you only intend to use it yourself and plan on taking the vehicle out of the country when you leave.<br>
However, the <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/q/11039/248"">mandatory liability insurance</a> is currently causing me headaches :(</p>

<p>Now, all this being said, you can get bags that have laptop compartments.  The only requirement is that they can see just the laptop and nothing else in there.  This way, you don't need to take it out. </p>

<p>This trick, along with the ""put all my electronics in my suit jacket, means that I get through the scanner as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>belt and shoes, with my suit jacket in one bin</li>
<li>unzip my backpack so that the laptop is flat and the rest is laying out in front</li>
<li>my toilettries bag (an old pencil case connected to the bag via a carbiner) hooked to the top.</li>

"Is it offensive to use 'Saigon' instead of 'Ho Chi Minh City'?","27229","","<p>I've heard some people talking about Saigon instead of Ho Chi Minh City. Besides the fact that those people usually were French (I'm French myself as well) I was wondering if that could be considered offensive by the Vietnamese people. As Saigon is the old name, they might feel a bit weird if someone was reminiscing about the ""good old days"" when Vietnam was a French colony.</p>

"Caught speeding 111 Mph (179 km/h) in California. How can I settle the case with the court?","27216","","<p>I was driving to Los Angeles from the Bay area, and was on a wonderful, straight road with no cars in sight. For whatever reason (doesn't matter) I was briefly speeding around 111mph (179 km/h), and was pulled over by an officer. This isn't on an interstate road.</p>

<p><strong>Some facts:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I was driving a rental car which has a copy of my driving license (from Czech Republic) and credit card.</li>
<li>I am a resident of the United Kingdom, and this has been my first time in the USA.</li>
<li>I have no California driving license / residency status</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How this happened:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I was given a citation, requiring mandatory appearance.</li>
<li>The officer said to await a letter, which would arrive within 30 days, which is a week before I leave the country.</li>
<li>I have not received the letter and called the court after the period expired. Then scheduled a date 6 days before my flight back</li>
<li>The day came and I cycled to the local court, where I read online it would be. In reality it was 4 hours away and I wasn't able to make it. The next available hearing was a day after I leave the country.</li>
<li>I called them up again, asking what I can do. They suggested I write a letter to the judge asking to remove the mandatory appearance, which I have sent by FedEx and was delivered before the next Friday. I don't know if they read it or what the action on it is.</li>
<li>Left the country, a friend of mine at the address I stayed at forwarded the letter containing the text below:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>You have failed to settle this case. Your continued failure to comply will result in a driver's license suspension and increased bail in the amount of $286.00 and a civil assessment of $300.00. Any unpaid balance will be referred to the franchise tax board for collection.</p>
  
  <p>Your appearance in court is mandatory to clear this citation. You must appear at the traffic division counter on Fridays only at 8:00 A.M. or 1:00 P.M. before 03/23/17.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there anything I can do at all? I am trying to contact them but I don't think there's any way I can talk to the judge directly, or to have a video conference with someone who has authority to resolve this.</p>

<p>I am getting deeper and deeper in their bureaucratic system and am worried it'll end up in an international search warrant and time in US jail.</p>

<p>What to do?</p>
","<p>The ""speeding in excess of 100mph"" charge, <a href=""http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=VEH&amp;sectionNum=22348"" rel=""noreferrer"">CVC 22348(b)</a>, is a civil infraction.  We do not issue arrest warrants for those.  However, <strong>failure to appear</strong> <a href=""https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=VEH&amp;sectionNum=40508."" rel=""noreferrer"">(CVC 40508)</a> is a <em>crime</em>, and this charge <em>will</em> become that soon. </p>

<p>On the speeding-over-100, you (or your lawyer) do need to face the judge; and that is so they can give you a stern warning, explain the future consequences for doing it again, and make you ""scared straight"".  (<em>straight</em> is US slang for <em>obeying the law</em>).  </p>

<h2>Failure to appear = Emergency</h2>

<p><a href=""https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=VEH&amp;sectionNum=40508."" rel=""noreferrer"">Failure to appear</a>, however, is a misdemeanor and will almost certainly result in a warrant for your arrest.  <strong>This is an actual crime</strong>. It may be surprising that a civil infraction turns into a criminal matter if ignored, but that is exactly what happens.  Given the language in the letter and the fact that you obviously missed your resolve-it date, that may have already happened. </p>

<p>Heading home without handling this properly is a novice mistake.  Your only option now is to hire a lawyer, since you have left the country.  Hire one who is local to the court your ticket is in - it should be a lawyer who knows the judges and staff, and isn't disliked by them.  My favorite way to get lawyer referrals is call other nearby lawyers who <strong>do not</strong> practice in that area of law, and go ""I'm sorry, do you know anyone who could help me?""  Make 3-4 such calls, you'll start hearing the same name over and over.</p>

<p>FTA is a new, second charge, so that would be two charges.  The upside is this makes it easier to plea-bargain since you now have two things to trade. </p>

<h2>How to plead it</h2>

<p>All this will happen at <em>arraignment</em>, which is only the initial phase; but given your options it will surely finish here. That is common in traffic matters.</p>

<p>If you had done this sooner, you <em>could have</em> pled not-guilty and asked for a proper trial (which is still a 2-3 minute affair).  An order would be issued for the officer to come and testify. Generally if the officer appears, you lose, and if he doesn't, you're off scot-free.  <em>But you lost that opportunity.</em></p>

<p>Next you can say you do not wish to plead guilty to 111 mph but would plead guilty to 99 mph, and hope the judge will allow that.  The reason to do this is to save a few hundred dollars (the point on your record and opportunity for traffic school doesn't matter to you).  You are betting the judge doesn't want to waste time with a trial. <em>(except now he knows there won't be a trial, oops).</em>  You can still try arguing it; good chance it will work. </p>

<p>However, if the <em>failure to appear</em> exists, it's more complicated.  You must get that dismissed!  You can argue your bona-fide effort to reach the courthouse previously. It would have helped if you were standing in front of him <em>personally</em>, obviously come quite a distance and effort to answer this charge, <em>can't do that now,</em> but judges are pretty sanguine about dismissing failure-to-appear if you <em>really do</em> appear (via lawyer is fine) <em>willingly out of your own initiative</em>  Of course, this will only impress them if you do it right away.</p>

<p>The key is to resolve it <em>together with</em> the underlying ticket as a plea-bargain; if you already resolved the ticket, you have nothing to bargain with!  So you ask the judge to dismiss the failure-to-appear if you plead guilty on the 99 mph.  Or if that is not acceptable to the judge, ask to dismiss the FTA if you plead guilty on 111mph.  </p>

<h2>How do you argue this now you're gone?</h2>

<p>I would have said to <em>try</em> trial-by-mail.  However the CVC 22348(b) is crystal clear; you must <strong>show up</strong> in court in person: either you or your lawyer. </p>

<p>If the failure-to-appear was not a factor, I might have said try it anyway and see if it works.  But it's a gamble; the judge may not have the <em>freedom</em> to waive the CVC 22348(b) requirement since you always can hire a lawyer.   </p>

<p>However, <strong>dismissing the failure-to-appear is an absolute top priority</strong>.  This would make you an <em>international criminal</em>, and that's not nearly as much fun as the James Bond movies make it out to be. </p>

<p>As such, I would say you are pretty much stuck with hiring a lawyer.   Because he can manage every possible contingency.  He's pretty much going to argue what I said above.  <em>You could've done it yourself if you'd done it sooner.   Live and learn.</em> </p>

<p>It really doesn't help your case that <em>you were inside the USA the entire time the ticket was pending</em> and you did nothing. They will feel like <em>you consider their court a joke</em>.  On the other hand, if you retain a lawyer after you had already made your escape, that says you <em>take your relationship with America seriously</em>, and earlier was a novice mistake you own up to.  They will not care that you fled the country since they would not have sent you to jail for this.</p>

<p><strong>You need to do this right away.</strong>  If you wait months -- or worse, if you put it off until the next time you want to visit the USA! -- it will be much, much worse.  It happens all the time where a traveler clears <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Passenger_Information_System"" rel=""noreferrer"">the pre-check,</a> arrives at JFK Airport, and gets denied entry because of something the pre-check missed and put on a plane back home (at his expense).</p>

<hr>

<hr>

<p>By the way, when you sign a traffic ticket in CA and many other states, you are not admitting guilt. You are swearing a promise to appear in court, which is part of a fair exchange: <em>you promise to appear later, and <a href=""http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/how-judges-decide-release-own-recognizance.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">they let you go now</a></em>.  If you are convicted of violating that promise, you won't be trusted in the future, and could be hauled to jail while you watch your friends be cited and released for the exact same charge.</p>

<p>And if an FTA remains unresolved, then the next time any state officer stops you for any reason, he will probably take you to jail. (he'll make a judgment call based on his ability and the seriousness of the underlying crime). Sorry, if you're sitting at JFK Airport, California will not extradite you (give you a free flight to CA) for a speeding ticket.</p>

<p>Also, if you had a CA driver's license, insted of 99 you'd plead 29 over the speed limit; 30-over disqualifies you for traffic school by mail, which would remove the point from your record.</p>

"Why are prices published without tax in the US?","27169","","<p>On a recent trip to San Francisco it was always a surprise to see what to pay in stores. It was never as simple as just adding all the published prices. There was always the addition of taxes. Sometimes it was just an additional 50ct, but sometimes the increase in price was substantial. The most extreme case being a bag of apples with a advertised price of 1.99 but a final price of 4.50. Isn't there a single VAT and how can I know the price to expect? If the taxes apply to everyone, why not simply publish the price including taxes?</p>
","<p>There is no general VAT in the US but various sales taxes, which means that there isn't a single tax rate that shops could easily include in all prices. Depending on the location, there could be a sales tax from the state, county, city or even other institutions (transport authorities, etc.) so you cannot even set a price and print labels for a state or a metropolitan area, let alone nationwide.</p>

<p>Also, displaying lower prices is generally advantageous so as long as they don't <em>have</em> to do it, it would seem retailers have very little incentive to figure a way to deal with all this. Even if one would consider doing it (which is not the case as far as I know), they would just make themselves look bad compared to the competition. To use an analogy, even when several parties really wish to reduce their weapon stockpiles, it's too risky for one of them to disarm unilaterally and find itself alone without weapons when the others still have them (or in this case, display higher after-tax prices when everybody else advertises with before-tax prices).</p>

"May kids ride in the back of a 5th Wheel in the US?","27086","","<p>I'm investigating changing to a 5th wheel RV - that's the kind of travel trailer that you tow behind a pickup.  In such a setup, there is no access from the driver in the truck to the living space being pulled behind.</p>

<p>My wife is under the impression that in such a setup, the kids are not allowed to be in the RV while the setup is in motion.  I am aware of no such rule. When I asked an RV salesman, he said as long as there is an uninterruptible communications mechanism (e.g. walkie talkies - but not a cell phone), it's legal.  That said, he was trying to sell me a 5th wheel, so I took what he said with a pinch of salt.</p>

<p>Here's the question then -  Generally speaking, is it permissible for people to occupy the 5th wheel, while the thing is in motion?  And, is the answer different if my wife is in back with the kids? In other words, is it okay for my wife to ride with me, and have the kids be alone (they are actually rather responsible for 10 and 7), or would that be negligence? </p>
","<p>Like so many things in the USA, this varies state by state. In most states, no-one may be in the back - not a responsible adult, and not a child either. The concerns are that there are no seatbelts, that the trailer might flip during an accident, and that there is no way for the people in the trailer to know that you are about to swerve or break hard - not even a panicky swear word which is all most people manage to say when an accident starts. It's not realistic to think you would get on the walkie talkie to say ""hang on!"" when someone cuts you off and you have to stand on the brakes.</p>

<p>That said, some states allow it. Here's a quote from the California rules that I found on on <a href=""http://www.rvforum.net/SMF_forum/index.php?topic=12232.0"">an RV Forum</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here is what the California Vehicle Code Section 21712 says about
  that:</p>
  
  <p>(g) A person shall not drive a motor vehicle that is towing a
  trailer coach, camp trailer, or trailer carrying a vessel, containing
  a passenger, except when a trailer carrying or designed to carry a
  vessel is engaged in the launching or recovery of the vessel.</p>
  
  <p>.....</p>
  
  <p>(i) Subdivision (g) does not apply to a trailer coach that is towed with a fifth-wheel device if the trailer coach is equipped with
  safety glazing materials wherever glazing materials are used in
  windows or doors, with an audible or visual signaling device that a
  passenger inside the trailer coach can use to gain the attention of
  the motor vehicle driver, and with at least one unobstructed exit
  capable of being opened from both the interior and exterior of the
  trailer coach.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That thread includes plenty of passionate arguments why being in the back is horrible, along with people saying it's just the same as moving around in a large bus. I don't think it is the same, because of suspension differences and because the 5th wheel can flip under circumstances that would not flip a bus, but I have never been in a moving 5th wheel and I have been in a moving all-in-one. </p>

","<p>As someone that had first-hand experience of this (ie, I did exactly the same thing!) I can tell you that it's fairly simple.</p>

<p>Once your temporary license expired you are ""unlicensed"" - you will have been in the state long enough that technically your home-country license is no longer valid in California, and your California license is expired.</p>

<p>It says ""Please remove this label"".  By feeling and pressing the sticker I do not detect anything underneath it. Holding to the light reveals nothing.  The pages behind this page are all blank.  There is no explanation in the guidance brochure they sent along with the passport (I am one of those people that reads <em>every word</em> of the guidance).  Below the sticker there is some text, if you read paragraph 7 you learn that tampering with a British passport may be actionable as a criminal offence.  Incredible to relate, this text is on the <strong>same page</strong> as the sticker they want you to remove.</p>

<p>Is the purpose of this sticker simply to prove I have examined the passport?  Does it replace the wet signature the end user should provide? Or does it flag up if I walk near a scanner? Some kind of electronic signal? If not, what is the purpose of this sticker?  </p>

But when it gets to <em>purpose</em>, the article descends into speculation.  </p>
","<p>The general consensus on the internet seems to be that the sticker is an RFID chip used by Identity and Passport Service (IPS) to track the production process of the passport from start to shipping. There are many such questions disseminated across the web (<a href=""http://www.funtrivia.com/askft/Question137848.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>, <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/whatisthisthing/comments/24rqf9/had_to_remove_this_label_from_my_uk_passport/"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a> and <a href=""http://www.c4p.biz/forum/post/index.htmhttp://www.c4p.biz/forum/post/index.htm?t=14231"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a> are a few examples).

"Why are one-way plane tickets more expensive than return tickets?","26896","","<p>It seems like <strong><em>one-way tickets are always more expensive than buying round-trip</em></strong>. But what if I have two destinations? For example I would like to go on the following itinerary this March:</p>

<p><code>London --&gt; Austin --&gt; Rio de Janeiro --&gt; London</code></p>

<p>At the moment the cheapest way to do this seems to be:</p>

<p><code>London --&gt; Austin --&gt; Rio de Janeiro --&gt; Austin --&gt; London</code></p>

<p>but that seems a bit ridiculous. Is there not a way to just buy a series of one way tickets that would follow the first itinerary? Please keep in mind, <strong>my main concern is price</strong>. </p>
","<p>It's hard to understand why this can be the case without some background in how airline fares work, so lets start with a bit of background...</p>

<p>For each route, airlines will publish a number of different fares, each with a distinct ""fare code"" - normally with weird names like ""TANRKL"", ""YSJWNN"" or ""X34Q"".  Corresponding to these fare codes are ""fare rules"" which dictate things like whether changes/refunds are allowed on that fare class (and what fees are payable for them), whether stopovers are allowed, etc.</p>

<p>In addition to the customer-facing conditions the fare rules include controls over what type of trips that fare can be used for, with terms such as  ""One-way"", ""Return"", ""Open-jaw"", ""Circle"", and ""end-on-end"" being common.</p>

<p>eg, looking at one specific ""cheap"" AA fare (""ONE0F0Q1"") I can see the conditions ""FARES GOVERNED BY THIS RULE CAN BE USED TO CREATE ROUND-TRIP/CIRCLE-TRIP/SINGLE OPEN-JAW JOURNEYS"".  A more expensive fare on the same route (fare code ""H2"") has the conditions ""FARES GOVERNED BY THIS RULE CAN BE USED TO CREATE ONE-WAY JOURNEYS.""</p>

<p>If you're booking a return fare then you will be able to use the cheaper fare, whereas if you book a one-way it'll automatically bump you up to the more expensive fare as the cheaper fare doesn't allow one-way.  In each case the booking engine will automatically pick the cheapest fare for what you're doing - it's actually very possible (especially for domestic flights) that you'll end up with 2 ""one-way-only"" fares instead of a ""return"" fare if that-s the cheapest way to do it.</p>

<p>Frequently, as you've said, the one-way ticket will actually cost more than it would to buy a return.  Some people will tell you in these situations that you can just buy the return and not fly the 2nd leg - but it's worth keeping in mind that the one-way ticket, by being a higher fare class, probably includes better ticket conditions than the cheaper return.  eg, it's likely that the cancellation fee on the more expensive ticket will be reduced (or even eliminated), and fees for making changes to the ticket will often be lower.  ie, you are normally getting a ""better"" ticket for your money - even if it means that you end up sitting in exactly the same seat!</p>

<p>In addition to one-way and return there's a third class of travel, called ""circle"".  A circle fare is when you fly AAA-BBB-CCC-AAA, without returning to BBB on the way back.  As with one-way, some fares allow circle routes, and others do not - with the likelihood of them being allowed increasing with the price of the fare.</p>

<p>Next comes stopovers.  Some tickets will allow you to have a ""stopover"" with wording something like this :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ORIGINATING UNITED KINGDOM -</p>
  
  <p>1 FREE STOPOVER PERMITTED IN CONTIGUOUS U.S.A.</p>

<p>That means that on the way from AAA-CCC you can stop somewhere in the middle.  The problem is that it needs to be somewhere ""on the way"".  eg, if you're flying AAA-BBB-CCC, then you can have a stopover at BBB, but not anywhere else.</p>

<p>The other term you'll often see mentioned in the fare conditions is ""end-on-end"", with text something like this :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>END-ON-END</p>

<pre><code>END-ON-END COMBINATIONS PERMITTED. VALIDATE ADJACENT
LINE OF FLIGHT FARE COMPONENTS ONLY. TRAVEL MUST BE VIA
THE POINT OF COMBINATION.
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>""End-on-end"" refers to booking 2 distinct fares, but having them combined on a single ticket.  This can be used to give fares for routes that an airline has not published a fare for - but it can also be used to get cheaper fares if the combination of the two fares is cheaper.  Some fares will also include text like ""SIDE TRIPS PERMITTED."" in the end-on-end rules, which means that not only can you add in another trip at your destination, but you can also add in a separate ""side trip"" at a stopover point.</p>

<p>As an example, I recently flew from San Francisco (SFO) to Newark (EWR).  When I looked up the prices, it was around $800 to fly direct, or around $400 to fly via Denver (DEN).  Digging into this, the reason was because the only fare available on SFO-EWR was a high-priced fare (United ticket class ""H"").  But on SFO-DEN and DEN-EWR there were cheaper fares available - around $200 for each leg, and both fares allowed ""end-on-end"" combinations.  Thus I bought a single ticket SFO-DEN-EWR, but behind the scenes I was actually paying for 2 distinct legs, each with their own fare codes.</p>

<p>Now, back to your specific question.  You're after LON-AUS-GIG-LON.  There's a number of different ways that a ticket like this could be built.</p>

<p>Firstly, you could do a number of ""one-way"" fares - LON-AUS, AUS-GIG, GIG-LON.  This will always work (as airlines always allow one-way fares), but as mentioned above it'll likely be expensive.</p>

<p>Next, you could do it as a ""circle"" fare.  To do that, you'd need to find one airline that had published fares for each of LON-AUS, AUS-GIG, GIG-LON, AND those fares allowed ""circle"" trips.</p>

<p>Alternatively you could do it as 2 end-on-end return fares - LON-AUS-LON  and AUS-GIG-AUS.  The requirement for circle trips is now gone, as it's just 2 simple return flights, but you're having to backtrack to AUS on the return as end-on-end fares normally include the condition that ""TRAVEL MUST BE VIA THE POINT OF COMBINATION"", which in this case means you need to pass via AUS in both directions.</p>

<p>The next option is to use a stopover.  eg, you could potentially fly a single fare of LON-GIG-LON, with a stopover of AUS on the way over. The problem is that there's no airlines that have a flight from LON-GIG that stops in AUS so in this case that's not going to work.</p>

<p>The final option - and the reason that it's best to leave finding fares to computers rather than humans - is to combine one or more of the options above to find the best route/price.</p>

<p>Plugging your requirements into <a href=""http://matrix.itasoftware.com/"">ITA Software's</a> search engine for some random dates in February it came up with a best price of <strong>£691.89</strong> on American Airlines.  Looking at the details of how it came up with that price, we see that it actually used 4 different fare code to build the entire fare :</p>

<pre><code>Fare 1: Carrier AA ONE0F0Q1 LON to RIO (rules)
Passenger type ADT, round trip fare, booking code O
Covers LHR-JFK (Economy), JFK-GIG (Economy)

Fare 2: Carrier AA QA21ERP1 NYC to AUS (rules)
Passenger type ADT, one-way fare, booking code Q
Covers JFK-AUS (Economy)

Fare 3: Carrier AA QA21ERP1 AUS to NYC (rules)
Passenger type ADT, one-way fare, booking code Q
Covers AUS-JFK (Economy)

Fare 4: Carrier AA ONE0F0Q1 RIO to LON (rules)
Covers GIG-JFK (Economy), JFK-LHR (Economy)
 Passenger type ADT, round trip fare, booking code O
</code></pre>

<p>So it's actually booked one round-trip flight LON-GIG-LON (fare 1 and 4), with a stopover in JFK on the way over.  If we were to check the fare rules we'd find that fare allowed ""return"" trips, but almost certainly doesn't allow ""one-way"" trips. We also know that it must allow stopovers (as we've got one in JFK).</p>

<p>Next we've got 2 one-way fares from NYC-AUS (fare 2) and AUS-NYC (fare 3).  These are domestic fares in the US, and in most cases airlines don't bother with the whole one-way/return distinctions for domestic fares, so it's not more expensive to book them as one-way rather than return.</p>

<p>The trip to AUS is occurring from your stopover point (JFK) of the first trip rather than your destination (GIG), which means that the fare for LON-GIG-LON allowed a ""side trip"" during the stopover in JFK.</p>

<p>Putting this all together, you get your full trip - LHR-JFK-AUS, AUS-JFK-GIG, GIG-JFK-LHR for under 700 quid (around US$1100).</p>

"Just how much cheaper is booking Spirit flights at airport vs. online?","26878","","<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zXeX8.png""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zXeX8.png"" alt=""Spirit disclaimer""></a></p>

<p>Spirit Airlines flights are <a href=""http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/other-north-south-american-airlines/1282664-spirit-says-lower-fares-generally-available-airport.html"">apparently cheapest to book at the airport</a>. You still have to book ahead for the best fares (not just show up the day you want to travel), so it means making an extra trip to the airport to book ahead. What I've read seems to indicate that their ""passenger usage fee"" (for using their website) isn't charged at the airport ticket counter.</p>

<p>I haven't been able to find out exactly how much you save by booking at the airport, is it just what they itemize as ""passenger usage fee"" ?</p>

<p>For instance, if I see that fee as $17.99, is that exactly how much I'll save? So in this case, the flight would cost $16.11 at the airport?</p>

<p>Is the same true of international flights?</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/f91QV.png""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/f91QV.png"" alt=""Colombia - USA flight""></a></p>

<p>Is it true then that international flights ex-US are cheaper at the airport and ex-other countries aren't cheaper at the airport?</p>

<p>The airport staff said people sometimes do come to book tickets in person and that they are cheaper but they weren't sure of all details of the system. They said generally the end total the customer pays is cheaper by the amount they show on the website as ""Passenger Usage Fee"" regardless of adjustments to taxes or type of flight (international, round trip, ...). Wether or not that passenger usage fee is charged is always shown on their site and depends on the the type of fare, and it's generally not charged for $9 fare club or for outbound flights that originate at non-US airports -- it's charged for both outbound and return legs for round-trip international flights departing the US, while it isn't charged for either outbound or return for round-trip flights departing an international origin to US.</p>

<p>Updates from subsequent experiences: </p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>A second experience booking at the airport, resulted in the $17.99 (facility fee) discount.</li>
<li>$14 at the airport instead of instead of $41 online, a $27 discount.</li>

"Do any States in the US give traffic tickets for 5 mph above the speed limit?","26739","","<p>In Louisiana, USA it's widely understood (unofficially) that one can travel 5mph above the speed limit without receiving a speeding ticket. </p>

<p>Does this rule apply when traveling the rest of the States? </p>
","<p>Getting stopped for going only 5 MPH over is unlikely anywhere in the US.  Of course it can still happen if something else is suspicious, e.g. very dark tinted windows (which may also be illegal), a very unusual looking vehicle, etc.</p>

<p>5 MPH over could be a discrepancy in measurement equipment, and officers do not want to go to court to explain when and how their radar gun was calibrated, etc.  If they see you doing 20 over and write you a ticket for 10 or 15, it's less hassle for them.  This cuts both ways: if your speedometer is slightly miscalibrated (entirely possible), you might be doing 10 over when you think you're doing 5 over.</p>

<p>But there is no such ""rule"" that lets you drive over the limit.  If you believe the speed limit is too low, it is incumbent upon you as a member of a democracy to try to get the limit increased.</p>

"Danger zones in Austin, Texas","26712","","<p>While reading reviews about hotels in Austin, Texas, I found some reviews talking about areas struck with crime and drugs, where it is dangerous to walk the streets. I don't drive, and would like to walk the city as much as possible. How can I make sure that I don't enter any danger zones?</p>
","<p>I've lived in Austin for about 15 years, so I have a pretty good idea of areas that are dangerous. Thankfully, most of the city is quite safe, especially the places where a visitor is likely to be walking around. The following crime heat map should be helpful:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.trulia.com/real_estate/Austin-Texas/crime/"">http://www.trulia.com/real_estate/Austin-Texas/crime/</a></p>

<p>However, that map may be a little misleading. You'll notice that the highest concentration of crime is in downtown (right on top of the ""Austin"" label). But that's also the most densely populated area and the center of nightlife, so it's no surprise that this area would see more incidents. In my experience, most of downtown is fairly safe. Of course, you'll want to use common sense just like in any city (i.e. stay alert and stick to areas with other people around, especially at night).</p>

<p>Also, one thing to keep in mind about downtown Austin is that there's a homeless shelter around 7th and Neches. Violent attacks by this homeless population are very rare, but it has happened occasionally. (Most likely, they'll just ask you for change.) If this makes you uncomfortable, you should avoid this corner. But I wouldn't recommend cutting too wide of a swath -- some of the best music venues in town are one block away (on Red River St) and these spots are pretty popular and safe.</p>

<p>Another central Austin crime hotspot that you'll notice on the map is just north of downtown (between Martin Luther King Jr Blvd and Dean Keaton St). This is right next to the University of Texas, so a high concentration of college students live in this zone. The crime here is mostly stuff like car break-ins, party-related incidents, etc. None of this should really concern a visitor, and there's not much for tourists to see here anyway.</p>

<p>Historically, the area east of downtown (on the east side of I-35) has been a low-income neighborhood. In recent years, this zone has experienced a lot of gentrification and is home to a number of new restaurants, shops, and bars. There are also many great establishments here run by the long-time residents of east Austin. This area is generally pretty safe, but it's worth exercising some caution if you decide to walk through these neighborhoods. (As you can see, the map has some patches of orange in that vicinity.)</p>

<p>On the map, you'll also notice some crime hotspots in far north and northeast Austin (around Cameron Rd and Rundberg Ln). These are low-income neighborhoods that can be dangerous in certain spots. However, there's probably not much that a visitor would want to see in these areas, and they're also not very pedestrian-friendly (although there are some great and affordable Asian restaurants in far North Austin).</p>

<p>In general, you're probably pretty safe if you stick to the typical tourist areas (which in Austin aren't very touristy). These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Congress Ave just south of the river (i.e. ""South Congress"")</li>
<li>Downtown around the capital, city hall, 6th St, Red River, etc.</li>
<li>6th and Lamar (for shops, etc.)</li>
<li>University of Texas campus</li>
<li>The hipster areas east of I-35</li>
<li>Barton Springs Rd and Zilker Park</li>
<li>The hike &amp; bike trails on Ladybird Lake</li>
</ul>

"What is proper etiquette on bringing one night stands to a hotel room?","26688","","<p>somewhat related to <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/22285/"">""Can a hotel kick you out if you let an unregistered guest share a room with you?""</a>:</p>

<p>In the, alas, completely hypothetical scenario where I'm out in a foreign town and just happen to meet someone, I wonder whether it would be acceptable to take them with me to my (single occupancy) hotel room. I'd expect that to differ a lot in different countries.</p>

<p>Always booking double rooms isn't a solution, since good things happen only when you don't expect them.</p>
","<p>Actual practice varies widely by country, but there are (at least) four reasons why hotels frown on having more guests in a room than you originally told them.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Fire code</strong>. Hotels and rooms are rated for maximum occupancy: if they get busted for having two people in a room for one, or (worse) 101 guests in a hotel rated for 100, there are serious legal penalties (for the hotel) in many countries.</li>
<li><strong>Profit</strong>.  A room for two usually costs more than a room for one, even when it's actually the same physical room.  If you sneak two people into your single room, they've lost out on extra income, and obviously the beancounters don't like this.</li>
<li><strong>Registration requirements</strong>.  Many countries require that all foreign nationals staying in hotels have to be registered, and it may be a violation of the law to have unregistered guests.  (Not necessarily applicable if your newfound friend is a local, although a few particularly paranoid countries register all hotel guests.)</li>
<li><strong>Laws prohibiting cohabitation</strong>.  Not much of a problem in the West anymore, but in eg. much of the Middle East, having two unrelated and unsupervised people of the opposite sex in the same room may be a crime (<em>khalwat</em>, ""proximity""), even if you're not getting down and dirty.</li>
</ol>

<p>The <em>correct</em> thing to do etiquettewise, then, is to book a room for two in advance, but unless you're sure you're getting lucky, this is often impractical.</p>

<p>The <em>practical</em> (but somewhat embarrassing) thing to do is to request an upgrade at the counter, at which point they can also register your guest.  In places like Thailand, where rent-a-dates and sex tourism is big business, hotels either impose ""guest fees"" for overnight visitors, or (at the lower end) explicitly market themselves a ""guest-friendly""; as far as I know, in Bangkok there's <a href=""http://www.theatlantahotelbangkok.com/"">precisely one hotel</a> which proclaims itself a ""bastion of  wholesome tourism"" and bans overnight guests, and has achieved minor notoriety as a result!</p>

<p>But if you're stuck in some Atlanta-like institution, eg. Japanese business hotels where ""single"" really means ""single"" and you'd have to get another room, you could just do like us international uni students in the dorms did, and sneak your dates in via the fire escape, undetected by the beady eyes of the night security guard at the main entrance, and hope the good vibes balance out the bad karma.</p>

<p>Or, if you're not as skift as as exchange student and are actually in Japan (or most anywhere in Asia, really), you could go rent a <a href=""http://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Japan#Love%20hotels"">love hotel</a> and get a circular bed, mirrors on the ceiling, and bondage Hello Kitty watching over you.</p>

If possible, I'd like to rent a car - but I've only had a full UK driver's license for less than a year. I gather that there is no longer a legal requirement that car rental drivers have had a license for more than 12 months, but every car rental company I can find enforces a 12-month minimum anyway.</p>

<p>I understand that as a new license holder I'd be viewed as a riskier customer. I don't mind paying extra.</p>

<p>Is there any UK car rental company who'll accept customers who held their license for less than a year?</p>

<p>I'm well over any age limits (over 25) and have no blemishes on my license. I have another international license, but I've held that for even less time than my UK license.</p>
","<p>I've had a friend in a similar situation who has had success with <a href=""http://enterprise.co.uk"">Enterprise</a>. This is what their website says in terms of license requirements:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Documentation- all drivers must produce all parts of a valid driving
  license. Non-EU license holders are required to have an international
  driving permit if the license is not in English. Domestic renters must
  produce a photo ID- passport or driving license. International
  travelers must produce a passport, proof of return travel and
  residency information while in the U.K. renters who wish to use a
  debit card are also required to produce two proofs of address such as
  a bank or credit card statement, which are less than three months old
  and may be subject to additional checks. We reserve the right to
  request additional ID or conduct further ID checks. These may include
  ID checks with external partners who may check supplied details
  against databases to which they have access.</p>

<p>With that being said I would suggest giving them a call before actually booking a car. Their contact details can be found on <a href=""https://www.enterprise.co.uk/en/help/contact.html"">this page</a>.  </p>

<p>If they wind up not working out I would suggest scanning local companies on a website such as <a href=""http://yell.co.uk/"">Yell</a>. Keep in mind that if you have a license from a different country with an earlier issue date or none at all it's perfectly legal to show that instead.</p>

It is rather interesting that various countries around the world are split on this tradition. One could make an interesting world map.</p>
","<p>I would say it's the other way around. Italian chefs don't like to see leftovers on the plate as it could signal that you didn't like the food. Once, in a local bar in which I have lunch every day, I left with an unfinished plate on the table, and I was interrogated the next day to make sure nothing was wrong with the food.</p>

<p>However, there is another activity in Italy called: <em><a href=""https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fare_la_scarpetta"" rel=""noreferrer"">Fare La Scarpetta</em></a>, which means, after finishing your food, you clean the plate from the sauce with a piece of bread (like <a href=""http://www.italymagazine.com/sites/default/files/styles/300xauto/public/story/scarpetta_0.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">this</a>). </p>

"How to get to Ljubljana (Slovenia) from Trieste (Italy) by Train?","26010","","<p>My Italian part of my trip is almost over; currently enjoying Trieste.</p>

<p>I have been using the train around Italy but when I checked the Trenitalia website to see if a train left from Trieste to Ljubljana it says it does not know of any trains?</p>

<p>This does not make sense, surely there must be a train service from Italy to Slovenia?</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.trenitalia.com/cms/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=ad1ce14114bc9110VgnVCM10000080a3e90aRCRD"">http://www.trenitalia.com/cms/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=ad1ce14114bc9110VgnVCM10000080a3e90aRCRD</a></p>

<p>If not does anyone know the best way to get from Trieste to Ljubljana?</p>
","<p>I was not able to find train connection but on the pages of the <a href=""http://www.ap-ljubljana.si/eng/"">central bus station in Ljubljana</a> you can find buses that go to Trieste (local name in Slovenian: Trst). This is much shorter trip than taking detours and taxis as suggested by Paola. Here is a sample:</p>

"Japanese etiquette: Most common (and offensive) mistakes?","25986","","<p>I am aware that Japan has many unwritten rules of etiquette.  What are some of the most common (and offensive) breaches of etiquette made by visitors?</p>

<p>On the flip side, what behaviors show respect and understanding of the Japanese culture?</p>
","<p>Take name cards with two hands when given to you, give them with two hands. Look at the received card, put it in front of you on the table while you are talking to the person(s).</p>

<p>You CAN punch with one chopstick into food and hold it with the other if it's something hard to eat (dumplings, potatoes etc). Don't stick both in however.</p>

<p>Do not soak your sushi rice in soy sauce. Ideally, try to dip only the fish into it.
Do not throw too much wasabi into the soy sauce. Ideally, just take of a small piece and put it directly on the fish before eating it. Those two rules are specially important if you are sitting at a sushi counter since both of the errors tell the chef that you need to ""fix"" his food. You CAN however eat sushi with your right hand if you have issues with chopsticks. Eat the pickled ginger between sushi pieces in small portions - do not gobble it up before the sushi itself arrives.</p>

<p>In general, try to mimic the behavior of the people that are of the same status around you (co-workers, co-students) when it comes to bowing, where to sit, how loud to talk, how much to drink/eat when in presence of someone superior (boss, professor etc). </p>

<p>Do not address yourself/introduce yourself with -san. While you say ""this is mister Smith"" and in Japanese say ""this is Smith-san"", you do NOT introduce yourself with ""my name is Smith-san"" but rather ""my name is Smith"".</p>

<p>Dragons are lucky creatures. Do not compare something bad/dangerous to a dragon. I have seen this some times and it really shows you have no idea about Asia at large.</p>

<p>If you try to speak Japanese, try on someone you trust to give you a good evaluation first. If you have a strong English/French accent and people do not understand what you want to say in Japanese, you make them feel uncomfortable. You can on the other hand make a really good impression by being able to make some short phrases that you can use to give positive feedback (""Oishkatta desu"" after a dinner, etc) in a reasonably understandable accent.</p>

<p>Do not open gifts that you received in front of the person who gave them unless encouraged to do so. It makes you look greedy and there is a huge risk of face loss in case you do not like what you received etc.</p>

<p>If you have Japanese guests wherever you are, give them a small (toy/ceramic/whatever) frog as a departure gift. The word ""frog"" and ""return"" have the same pronunciation in Japanese and indicate that you want THEM to come back. Do not do that if you are at someone else's place.</p>

<p>If you go somewhere, buy a small souvenir (such as chocolates, cookies etc) from the place where you have been, specially local stuff stuff that normally cannot be bought in a supermarket everywhere. If you are in an office in Tokyo and go to Osaka for a business trip, buy some of the stuff sold at the train station. Those are always individually packed so you can give everyone in your department on cookie/whatever. Put those on everyone's desk when you return - no need to hand them over in person. It's not so important what it is, or that it's expensive. If you are on a private trip, buy something small for your best friends only - maybe your boss, too.</p>

<p>If you are in a restaurant, check if there is a cashier at the entrance when you come in. You will also most likely then have a paper on a clipboard at/under your table where the waiter notes down your orders. When paying, take that clipboard and go directly to the exit to pay. Otherwise, ask for the check on the table.</p>

<p>It's completely normal to ask which sauce goes with which food. Often Japanese people on the table will not know what goes with what either since many restaurants try to make it more special by adding different dipping sauces for a course.</p>

<p>You will most likely get 3 questions as a foreigner in Japan (in one row, asked from the same person): Do you speak/study Japanese? Do you like Japanese girls? Do you eat <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natt%C5%8D"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Nattō</a>? I think this comes from some Japanese having a certain fear that they are not Japanese ""enough"". They feel they speak poorly Japanese, they often prefer/admire western women and many do not like nattō. If you study/like the Japanese language, fancy Japanese girls AND like nattō, you are almost more Japanese then they wish to be. I speak Japanese and I like Japanese girls, but I do not like nattō. Japanese people were ALWAYS relieved when I told them I do not like nattō.</p>

<p>Do not bring up topics about WWII or the island disputes with Korea/China etc. If the topic is there already, do not comment on it. If you feel you need to contribute or participate, bring an example from history/territorial disputes in your country, but do not give opinions about the Japanese topics. Chances are high that what you read in your local newspaper outside of Japan is quite different from what you read inside of Japan, and you can only appear as a fool.</p>

<p>Do not expose any tattoos that you might have. Tattoos are traditionally linked to the Japanese Mafia.</p>

<p>Respect food. Finish your plate. <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/14853/what-is-wrong-with-eating-while-walking-in-japan-it-doesnt-seem-to-be-an-issue/14858#14858"">Don't walk around while eating</a>. </p>

<p>Do not tip people - anywhere, ever.</p>

<p>If you need to make/receive a cellphone call, leave the room/restaurant/train compartment.</p>

<p>If you take a picture with your cellphone or compact digital camera, make sure that the ""shutter sound"" is switched on. People are afraid of secretly taken pictures, specially in public places.</p>

<p>Be very careful how you behave in general. People will politely ignore if you behave in a rude manner. This does not mean that it's ok. I have seen many people who started to become more and more rude simply because nobody told them off. It can breed a certain level of arrogance since people think whatever they do is ok.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Regarding some of the comments below</strong></p>

<p>I would like to make a statement here regarding the accusation in the comments of me being sexist. I take any kind of discrimination very seriously and oppose them heavily. Therefore, I am even more upset when I am myself accused of being sexist. I considered this quite well and came to the conclusion that there is a need to comment on this. I perceive neither the comments nor my reply to be here in the right place, but as long as the accusation stands below, I am convinced that a proper reply from my side is absolutely necessary in respect of the weight of those accusations.</p>

<p>About the question about putting people in the same context as food:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Women"" in this topic are objects like Natto!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The accusation seems to be that a person asking me in direct sequence the questions if I like a type of food and if I like Japanese women is sexist. Me answering according to the question instead of rejecting the question as sexist, was making me sexist just as well. This means however that if someone said in one sentence to someone of the opposite sex: ""I love this country, and I love you, too"" would make someone sexist since it also compares a person with an object. I oppose this conclusion heavily. What introduction will one have to make then before talking about people to not degrade them and being accused of sexism? </p>

<p>About the question if the short time a tourist is in Japan matters:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why is your taste important as a tourist about ""Women"" of a country?! Women are foods or you are going to buy them or get married with them in a short period of time? 
  Surely these are not my questions as it is not important for me your or the others tourists' reason to travel to another country but this question is ""sexist"".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This question was asked by a Japanese person living in Japan to me, a foreigner living in Japan. While this page is not meant for expats, but for travelers, many people on this page return over and over to the same country and are therefore interested in the culture and mistakes one can make when having longer interactions with locals. My example does not address a weekend-tourist who only sees a few of the most famous temples in Kyoto. But regardless of this issue, nothing in this context is sexist just because the situation described does not apply to short-term tourists.</p>

<p>The context is about comparing a preference of a visual appearance of people in one part of the world to people of another part of the world. To perceive a visual difference between Caucasians and Japanese people is not sexist since it does not compare man to women in any way. It is further not racist since it is merely the observation of a very obvious fact, not a allegation of inherent superiority of one of them. Visual attraction (i.e. when seeing but not knowing a person) towards the other sex is a biological fact - and not sexism. Combining the visual attraction with a preference to the visual appearance, being the matter of a certain body type and possibly hair color is not sexism either. It does not treat women like objects and it does not judge men being superior to women. Otherwise the mere question ""Do you think this person looks attractive?"" was sexist too.</p>

"Can one carry an internal hard-drive in cabin-luggage?","25967","","<p>I'm currently in the process of moving from France to Canada.</p>

<p>I have plenty of computer equipment that I just put in boxes and that will be sent by naval transport. One thing I'm scared off though, is that people handling my boxes and/or the container aren't really delicate when it comes to moving stuff that contains hard-drives (I'm mainly concerned about my Network Access Storage device which contains tera-bytes of data). Obviously hard-drives are really sensitive to movement and could break easily if wrongly handled.</p>

<p>Putting those in checked-luggage doesn't seem like a better idea (some would even say it's actually worse) so the only option I can think of is taking at least one of the disks with me in cabin-luggage.</p>

<p>So here comes the question: <strong>is one allowed to carry such a disk in cabin luggage ?</strong> I know people travel all the time with external hard drives, but in this case, I'm afraid a custom police officer unaware of what this device is, might be afraid of the looks of an unenclosed hard drive such as:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YfFvI.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I can easily imagine how one could use a sharp hard drive as a dangerous projectile, but I could say the same for many other items so my concern is more about ""What is this metallic/electronic device that you can't turn on ? Is it a BOMB ?!""</p>

<p>I obviously made online backups of anything really valuable, but some of the data files are just too big to be uploaded in reasonable time now.</p>

<p>Should I prepare for the worst ?</p>

<hr>

<h1>Follow-up</h1>

<p>I actually used an old case for hard-drives of that size and could go through both french &amp; british customs/security checks without any trouble. They were more concerned about my shoes (you know, terrorist shoes, with small rings of metal to hold the laces) than about my hard drive.</p>
","<p>I have done this a couple of times until two years ago - within Europe only though. And while it was never I problem, I always had to show the HDD separately etc - and in the last case was recommended (by security staff at Birmingham (BHX) airport) to buy a cheap (€15) external case, pop the HDD in that and less questions (if any) would be asked.</p>

<p>I have done exactly that ever since and had no problem flying with as many as five or six of them in carry on luggage.</p>

If yes, can someone recommend a few, preferably with nice trails to walk.
The idea is to go into nature.</p>
","<p>Check out <a href=""http://www.freagle.org/en/find-campsite.html"">Freagle</a>. Freagle is like couchsurfing, instead of your couch you can offer your backyard, barn... </p>

<p>My own experience with wild camping in Germany is positive if you keep simple rules in mind. </p>

<li>Don't camp in a bigger group</li>
<li>Don't campfire</li>
<li>Don't litter</li>
<li>Keep yourself out of sight</li>

<li>Don't camp in a natural reserve (from comments: thanks @amon)</li>

"Buying a SIM card at Heathrow","25957","","<p>I'm flying to London and would like to get a UK SIM card as soon as I can. Is it possible to buy those at Heathrow airport? <em>Should</em> I buy one from there, or should I order it in advance instead and try to get it delivered to my hotel? Or should I just walk out to the nearest cellular store when I get to the hotel and buy one there?</p>
","<p>There are two types of mobile operators in the UK, network operators and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mobile_network_operators_of_Europe#United_Kingdom"">virtual</a> operators. Last time I landed at Heathrow terminal 1 there was a stand selling sim cards from one of the virtual operators between passport control and baggage claim though in central London you shouldn't have a problem finding a store of one of the network operators or the likes of <a href=""http://www.phones4u.co.uk/"">phones4u</a> or the <a href=""http://www.carphonewarehouse.com/"">carphone warehouse</a>. There is normally at least one network operator store and one general mobile store per high street. If you know what you want and it's only a pay as you go sim you can normally be sorted in 10min.</p>

<p>If you're going to be in a city for a while its important to think about what you need your cellphone for, local/international calls, text and data and choose an operator accordingly. Other things to consider, ease of top up for pay as you go, rolling monthly contracts(depending on the length of your stay) and Coverage. </p>

<p>Central London has good coverage from all providers the rest of London is adequately covered again if your staying long term make sure you accommodation isn't in a blind spot on the providers coverage map. Outside of London and the main centers coverage varies form network to network so choose accordingly.</p>

<p>The network providers are <a href=""http://www.o2.co.uk/"">O2</a>, <a href=""http://www.vodafone.co.uk/personal/index.htm"">Vodafone</a>, <a href=""http://www.orange.co.uk/"">Orange(t-mobile)</a> and <a href=""http://www.three.co.uk/"">Three</a> and. Each of these four own their own networks, there are also countless virtual operators who use part of, one, or more than one of the four networks.</p>

<p><strong>O2 and Vodafone</strong> have the low frequency ranges, However Vodafone does not offer 3G(Data) on their 900mhz network. The low frequency means you're more likely to get a signal in a confined space. However you typically pay a little more with these two providers. </p>

<p><strong>Three</strong> won't let a non 3G capable phone connect to its network so if you have an older phone it might not connect. Because 3G is designed for data and not voice the call quality on Three isn't the best.</p>

<p><a href=""http://canada.visahq.com/requirements/India/resident-United_States/"" rel=""nofollow"">VisaHQ</a> - for Indian passport, living in the US, you still need a visa, whether for business, tourist or transit purposes.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/visas.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">Citizenship and Immigration Canada</a> also confirms - visitors to Canada from India require a visa.</p>

<p>The Niagara Falls Live <a href=""http://www.niagarafallslive.com/niagara_falls_travel_tips.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">Travel Tips page</a> also confirms:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Persons wishing to travel to Canada whom are not U.S. citizens (ie:
  foreigner) may be required to get a tourist visa from the Canadian
  consulate in the country from which they are arriving from. If you are
  in the USA on a visa and wish to visit Canada while in New York there
  is a Canadian consulate located in Buffalo New York. <strong>YOU CANNOT OBTAIN
  A TOURIST VISA AT ANY OF THE BORDER CROSSINGS.</strong> When contacting the
  Consul, inform them that you wish to obtain a ""temporary resident
  visa"". As of April 1st 2012 the fee per person is $75 for a single
  entry visa, $150 for a multiple entry visa or $400 for a family
  (multiple or single entry).</p>

<p><strong>However</strong>, going back to the <a href=""http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/visas.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">Canadian Citizenship and Immigration</a> page:</p>

"Is it possible to rent a car in one US state and drop it off in another?","25668","","<p>I'm from the UK and I'm looking at planning a road trip around the US with some friends. I wondered if it was possible to rent a car in one state but drop it off in another.</p>

<p>If it's possible do they charge more for hiring this way? Are there some states that don't allow this to happen?</p>
","<p>Any of the major car rental companies will allow a ""One-way"" rentals.  Occasionally there are restrictions around specific locations, but in general if you're planning to go from a major airport to another major airport you'll have no problems at all.</p>

<p>The issue is the price, which can vary dramatically depending on a number of factors.  Some rental companies will charge a ""drop fee"" which will be a fixed amount, sometimes based on the distance between the two locations. Others will charge a higher per-day rate for one-way rentals. Some others will not charge extra for the rental, but will charge you an additional fee based on the number of miles you travel on the trip (ie, the actual miles you drive, not the straight-line distance between the two locations).</p>

<p>The best option is to look around at all of the various rental companies for the specific city pair and dates you're after - if possible in both directions as sometimes it's cheaper in one direction than the other.  Travel websites like Orbitz.com can be good as they will show you multiple companies in one search, but sometimes for one-way you'll get better rates when searching directly on the rental car companies site.</p>

<p>Occasionally the rental companies will run ""deals"" for one-way rentals when they have a need to get cars out of a location - a few years ago I did a 3-day rental from Portland, OR to San Francisco, CA for a total cost of less than $20!  These details are often listed on the rental car websites, but be careful as they do often have some strict restrictions such as no more than 7 days total rental. eg, Hertz currently has a deal for pickup in Arizona and drop-off in California, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah or Texas for <a href=""https://www.hertz.com/rentacar/bb-8657875/drive-out-of-arizona-for-as-little-as-%245-per-day-special-offer"">$5/day</a>!</p>

"What's the deal with the ""string people"" in central Paris?","25632","","<p>I've taken my fiancée to Paris twice - first for our 1st anniversary, and again for our 4th - and both times we had troubles with guys bothering us around the Sacré Coeur in Montmartre. They hang around the front entrance to the park and pester tourists with some sort of strange scheme involving tying string to people's fingers. From what  I can tell, anyone who's <em>ensnared</em> by the trick ends up being pestered into buying a bit of wool for a few euros.</p>

<p>Often we managed to get past them immediately by saying no, but in some cases they were persistent, and in a few cases they continually grabbed us and continued to shout at us after we escaped. In one case I had to physically pull one of them off my fiancée, as he was gripping her arm tightly and trying to tie string to her hand. Not exactly enjoyable when we're trying to have a relaxing holiday. In the end we resorted to walking up the long set of stairs to the left of the park and coming back down through the top entrance, which was exhausting and left us uncomfortable in the heat.</p>

<p>One thing I noticed is that the police periodically appear, and the sellers run off or hide down side roads. In once case we were treated to the sight of three armed officers chasing after one of them and tackling him to the ground, much the the enjoyment of everyone watching.</p>

<p>So, what's the deal with these guys? Are they breaking the law by being there? What's the best way to deal with them? We love everything about Paris, especially the Sacré Coeur, but these guys are an annoyance we'd prefer to avoid.</p>
","<p>I think the best write-up I've seen on this is at <a href=""http://www.corporatetravelsafety.com/safety-tips/category/pickpockets-france/tip/watch-out-for-the-infamous-paris-string-scam"">Corporatetravelsafety.com</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They begin the Paris String Scam by engaging you in innocent
  conversation and will usually say that they want to show you a magic
  trick.  Before you know it, a ""string man"" has grabbed your wrist or
  one or two fingers and encircled it with a homemade bracelet of
  colored string. You think the conversation or interaction is an
  interesting way to meet the ""local flavor"" of Paris and you allow them
  to engage you in what seems like an innocent act of being charmed by
  the ""locals.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This happens all over Paris, and especially (obviously) in heavily-touristy areas.  The scam then is to ""charge"" you for this bracelet you had no intention of wanting:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While the Paris String Scam may be fun to watch, when the string men
  finish making your new ""local Paris string bracelet souvenir,"" the
  string men will demand payment of around €20 Euros when they are
  finished, which is quite obviously not what the bracelet is worth. If
  you fail to pay them, they will doggedly follow you and be VERY
  insistent that you provide some amount of payment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's also commonly used as a distraction while a fellow of theirs pick-pockets you.</p>

<p>So someone being tackled by the police might have been one of these pick-pocketers.  Or arguably selling goods without a license, although it seems unlikely police would go tackle a guy for that (Although you see it on Westminster Bridge in London too - police appear, all the touts run off).</p>

<p>How to deal with them? The same site offers this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If someone approaches you with the words ‘for the church’ or
  ‘bracelet’ or ‘gift’ or 'magic' or 'trick' and they are carrying

  firm, and the string man who's targeted you will usually then move on

"Does applying for a multiple entry Schengen visa instead of a single entry the first time hurt my chances of a visa getting granted?","25543","","<p>While applying for a Schengen visa, an option is given to choose between a single entry visa or a multiple entry visa. There isn't any published policy on this, but if it's the first time time I'm applying for a Schengen visa does it hurt my chance of getting one in case I say I want to get a multiple entry visa instead of single entry?</p>

<p>(By 'hurt' I mean say I ask for multiple entry and a stricter rule is used for checking whether the visa is granted, then will I be given a single entry visa instead or will the whole application be rejected?)</p>
","<p>You're unlikely to get a definitive answer to this question, since the exact internal visa criteria are not published.  So take all advice you get with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>So.  Most countries do indeed treat multiple-entry status as an optional bonus of sorts: if you're borderline, instead of rejecting the application outright, you'll get a single entry instead.  My <em>understanding</em> is that the EU does this as well, but it would not hurt to ask the embassy before applying.</p>

<p>That said, if you're only a casual tourist and/or a first-time visitor, you're unlikely to get a multiple entry as your first visa.  Providing an itinerary that requires you to depart and re-enter Schengen (eg. Paris-London-Paris), preferably with some of proof that you really are going to do something legitimate (letters from business partners, conference registration, etc), may help.</p>

"What happens if I check in to a flight online, but then miss the flight?","25484","","<p>Back in the old days, you checked in for a flight when you arrived at the airport.  The airline then could see that someone was missing, and give your seat to someone else.  Now, if I check in for a flight online 24 hours early, the airline doesn't know if I'm sitting at the gate waiting to get on the plane, or sitting in traffic trying to get to the airport.</p>

<p>My question is, if I elect to check in online before I get to the airport, and then I don't get on the plane, what happens to me?  Will they let me board the next flight?  Will they make me pay a change fee?  Will they throw away my ticket and make me buy a new one?</p>

<p>If a general answer is not possible, let's say this is for a U.S. domestic flight on Delta.</p>
","<p>Checking in but not boarding the plane is a ""<strong>no show</strong>"" in industry lingo.  There's no Delta-wide ""policy"" on what happens next, this will depend entirely on the small print in your fare rules.  Broadly speaking, assuming you've got a non-refundable fare:</p>

<p><strong>Domestic flights</strong>: You'll get credit worth the value of your ticket, minus a <a href=""http://www.delta.com/content/www/en_US/traveling-with-us/ticket-changes-refunds/ticket-changes.html"">change fee</a> (typically $200).  So if your fare was under $200, you lose it all.  There may also be an additional condition requiring that any new ticket you purchase with the credit cost at least as much as the original.</p>

<p><strong>International flights</strong> will typically contain the following boilerplate in the rules:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>IF THE TICKETED FLT RESERVATION IS NOT CANCELLED PRIOR TO TICKETED FLT
  DEPARTURE TIME/ REBOOKING IS NOT PERMITTED AND TKT HAS NO VALUE</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...which means what it says, ie. you're screwed.  So either call ahead and change your flight, or hope that wailing, gnashing of teeth and rending of garments at the Delta counter helps.</p>

"How to avoid toddlers on a long-distance plane flight?","25456","","<p>I have recently taken a London - San Francisco (12 hour) flight, with a toddler in the seat directly behind me. His parents actively encouraged the kid to speak out in that typical proto-speech, while reading out from books. For 12 hours.</p>

<p>One might think that the industrial-strength earplugs I always carry with me would have helped. One would be very, very wrong.</p>

<p>What specific steps can I take in all of my future flights so that this experience will never, ever repeat itself?</p>
","<p>To avoid disturbance from small children, you can use a multi-pronged approach:</p>

<ul>
<li>first, try to choose flights that are more of a hassle for parents. Generally this means night flights - some parents may be sure their child will sleep (and not bother you) but others are worried the child will not sleep and will cry. So they take a daytime flight and are willing to entertain them for the length of the flight</li>
<li>second, try to minimize the impact of the child on you. Buy a more expensive ticket - first, business, even economy plus. Children are of course allowed in the more expensive zones, but they are in substantially fewer numbers. In some cases these children are experienced and quiet flyers, accompanying parents who have been kept awake by other people's children in the past. And do what you can to improve things at whatever seat you have. Bring noise cancelling headphones in addition to earplugs, for example. Bring some sort of music you can play that will drown out the repetitive reading.</li>
<li>third, try to react in the moment in some way that is more positive than sitting in your seat seething. Go for a walk. Strike up a conversation elsewhere on the plane. Turn around and interact with the child, such as playing peek a boo over the back of your seat. It's probably likely to be quieter than the reading and even endear you to the parents. Tell the child your name and ask theirs, and smile. If in a few hours you want to ask the parents if there's a quieter form of entertainment available, you won't be the grumpy gus in the next row, you'll be the toddler's airplane friend.</li>
<li>fourth, try to be realistic. No toddler does <strong>anything</strong> for 12 hours. They nap, they eat and drink, and so on. Focusing on the behavior that irritates you, to the extent you genuinely recall that it took the entire flight time, leaves you with a bad cloud around you that can take days to shake. When the noise starts, tell yourself it won't last the whole flight. Do something positive, listen to something, take yourself away from the noise. When the noise stops, be grateful, even if it's just a short respite. </li>
</ul>

<p>And finally, when you leave the plane, be grateful that you are now done with that child and don't have to hear the noise or put in any effort to try to prevent bedlam. The parents will still be on duty for hours more today, and for another few decades in general. Count your blessings!</p>

"Suitcases: hard or soft?  Canvas, polycarbonate or something else?","25417","","<p>So I'm in the market for a suitcase.  And let's start by making it clear that I do need a <em>suitcase</em>: point to point trip on a plane to a cold weather destination with lots of baby stuff, souvenirs and more to carry, so backpacks, carry-on only etc ain't gonna cut it.  80-100L or so ought to do the trick.</p>

<p>In general, I've preferred squishy canvas-y softcases along the lines of this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4XNqN.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Because they're nicer to lug around than something with sharp edges, can always expand in a pinch -- magic zippers for extra space rock -- and are pretty close to unbreakable.  (Incidentally, that bag -- like much of my luggage -- is from <a href=""http://www.antler.co.uk/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Antler</a>, a brand I've found to generally strike a reasonable compromise between price and quality.)</p>

<p>For things that shouldn't get squished, like my scuba gear, I used an ancient Samsonite plastic hardcase, which suffered many a hard knock over the years and finally gave up the ghost when the lock broke.  But now I understand that plastic is lame and all the cool kids are using polycarbonate hardcases, ideally the <a href=""http://www.premiumluggage.com.au/rolling-hardside-travel-luggage/rimowa.html?m=100&amp;b=48"" rel=""noreferrer"">original Rimowa Salsa/Topas</a>:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hgn1M.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>At $1000+ a pop here in Oz those are way out my target price range, but everybody's now making copies and eg. Antler's ""<a href=""http://theluggageprofessionals.com.au/suitcases-and-luggage/suitcases/antler-liquis-4-wheel-medium-rollercase.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Liquis</a>"" goes for $300 or so, which is a bit more that I'd like to pay but not entirely out of the question -- if it really is worth it. (Again, Oz prices, please don't taunt me with how much cheaper it's in the US.)</p>

<p>So here, finally, is the question.  <strong>Should my new bag be soft (canvas/polyester), hard (polycarbonate) or something else, and why?</strong>  Recommendations of specific models/brands also welcome.</p>
","<p>There is no one right answer for this. Either kind of suitcase could serve you well for this trip.</p>

<p>In my experience, the quality of the workmanship seems much more important than which type of sides your suitcase has in regards to its ability to protect its contents. You'll want strong sturdy zippers with big teeth that won't break easily, nice thick fabric that won't rip easily or sturdy solid sides that can handle impacts without breaking, sturdy pulls on the zippers, wheels that glide easily, handle that telescopes easily, etc. You can tell the quality fairly easily from a physical examination. Looking at a suitcase from a big box retailer vs. somewhere that carries name brands (Samsonite, Liz Taylor, Tommy Hilfiger, etc. etc.) you will notice a large difference in the quality of the materials, and generally, you get what you pay for, however if you have a store that specializes in one off and overstock merchandise from designer brands (sorry, don't know any of the names of places down under to suggest), sometimes you can get a better deal for the quality.</p>

<p>Certainly, there are other features to consider, like whether the suitcase has dividers and zippers to keep clothes separated or organized, or expansion zippers to add space for unexpected souvenirs. </p>

<p>Weight is definitely a consideration, the heavier the suitcase, the less weight left for luggage and the heavier it is lugging it up and down stairs to your lodging, etc. For that same reason, picking a size as large as needed but not larger is helpful too...if you only need a medium roller-bag, don't get a large one! Some suitcases are designed with lighter-weight materials than others. Depending on what you are carrying, if the suitcase is flimsier, you will lose less weight of baggage allowance, but the innards will be less protected. How much protection you need clearly varies considerably by what you pack and how you pack it. Many canvas-like rollerbags have stiff sides on 2-5 of the six sides, so you could pack your more delicate items nearer to the stiff sides, and put more clothes closer to the softer side for adequate protection. </p>

<p>The type of items you describe needing to transport, the protection provided by a regular rollerbag is probably sufficient, and you don't have the excess weight of a totally hard-sided luggage, and as you said, quite versatile! If you're anticipating transporting your scuba gear in this suitcase regularly, I'd probably pick differently because my primary considerations would be different. </p>

<p>PS: perhaps this question would have been better framed as an exhaustive list of the pros and cons of getting hard sided luggage vs a roller bag?</p>

"Modifying online flights to include stopovers","25246","","<p>I'm trying to get a visa for Canada, but that's beside the point. While I wait, I play with flights online, looking at prices.  I found that occasionally there's this weird multi-stop flight that shows up from Auckland, New Zealand to Nadi, Fiji, to Christmas Island, Kiribati, to Honolulu, USA, to Vancouver, Canada!</p>

<p>Now, these only have stopovers of like 1-3 hours, so it's for a refuel or to drop off passengers.  Certainly not enough time to get off.</p>

<p>However, if it were possible, I'd like to change the flight to include stopovers of a day to a week - I'm not fussed - I'm flexible, but I'd love to spend even a day in some of these places. </p>

<p>Most online booking sites don't seem to include stopover functionality, however.  Kayak allows you to display only flights with a certain length stopover, but this is in the  realm of hours, merely to let you configure it not to strand you in <a href=""http://www.sleepinginairports.net/worst-airports.htm#.TznUHJWXdO0"">Manila or LAX</a> for too long.  </p>

<p><strong>Is there a way to search online flights to configure stopovers of days in length, or do you have to book separate flights?</strong></p>

<p>In practice, how likely is one to be penalized for overstaying by a day, 10 days, and a month?</p>

<p>Are there countries that are more likely to enforce the rules on departure?</p>
","<p>Where you're from is likely irrelevant.  Overstaying is overstaying, you're not going to get treated more harshly or kindly because of who your president/king/prime minister is.</p>

<p>There's a great piece ""<a href=""http://www.euro-dollar-currency.com/overstaying_schengen_visa.htm"">Overstaying Schengen visa</a>"" that is relevant to this.</p>

<p><strong>Consequences of overstaying</strong></p>

<p>This could result in a:</p>

<ul>
<li>no consequence - if you're lucky, and this will depend greatly on who you deal with and what mood they're in.</li>
<li>fine - the smallest and easiest problem - although it can be expensive, it's solvable with money.  Have heard of 700 Euro fines for being 20 days over.</li>
<li>record - they may put something on your personal record for the Schengen countries, making it hard to get a visa in future.</li>
<li>ban on entry - you may be banned for 1-3 years (usual length of time).</li>
<li>deportation - very bad to have on your record, can affect all other travel to non-Schengen countries as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>In terms of some countries being more strict, if you are 'banned', you're more likely to get back in by applying to one of the countries only recently admitted to the area.  They're allegedly more likely to approve (presumably either lack of records, or for touristic purposes).</p>

<p>If you're then denied further re-entry, you can at best try to appeal for a visa - say for example, on grounds of compassion.  For more information, read about <a href=""http://www.euro-dollar-currency.com/schengen_visa_appeal.htm"">the Schengen visa appeal process</a>.</p>

<p>Is there a way to book a manual car in the US?</p>
","<p>tl;dr: <strong>You cannot</strong></p>

<p>Generally US rental companies don't have option to select transmission type, because they don't offer anything other than automatic.</p>

<p>The only cars in popular rental companies would have any chance to have manual transmission, would be high-end sports cars. And even so, that chance is slim to none.

They even have European sports cars like <em>BMW M5</em> or <em>Porsche Cayman</em>, also <em>only</em> automatic.</p>

<p>What I have heard is that even though I might not be refused entry to the US, I might get questioned a lot at the immigration checkpoint. I just want to know how much of this is true. I have a ten-year US visa already as a tourist, and I'm a Thai national.</p>

<li>Syria</li>
<li>Pakistan</li>
<li>Sudan</li>
<li>Bahrain</li>

<p>The list could be longer, and visiting one of these countries doesn't mean you will be refused; but, it matters, because they have a field in the visa application about the countries visited in the past 10 years. The guys I know were asked questions such as ""what's the purpose of visiting"". The rejection/approval totally depends on the interviewer and/or your answer. I have noticed the younger you are the higher chance of getting refused, if you visited one of these countries. I guess they believe the younger you are the easier your brain to be washed with anti-US stuff. Also I have noticed people who go to the US on regular basis they do not get refused! Usually these people have family ties. The last thing I have noticed is people who are from those other countries might have better chances of getting the visas while people who visited those countries might not get it! I also think the same logic applies for people who need electronic visas, where no interview is required, except from the customs guys upon arrival.</p>

<p>Anyway, as long as you already obtained the visa, then the chances of being asked again at the immigration/customs are low.</p>

<p>BTW, I work for a multinational company, many of the employees are required to have a US visa for business trips (hundreds) and that's my source. Also, I have been to all countries in the aforementioned list and I was asked the reason behind my visits but I always was granted the visa.</p>

","<p>I believe it depends on the issuing authority, but usually about two weeks if you pay the fee to have it expedited. You really can't ask for a definitive time, because it also depends on how busy they are. I have friends who paid the fee and got their passports renewed in just under two weeks, but that was a few years ago.</p>

<p>If you were born outside of the US and the issuing authority is the US State Department, it can take longer. I was informed of this when I received my daughter's passport, she was born abroad. </p>

<p>If you are out of the country and renewing through your local embassy, give it several months either way. I recently got a renewal in Manila which took just under 10 days, and inquired if that's the usual amount of time from most embassies and they said yes. But, don't let paperwork kerfuffles jeopardize your travel plans, or being abroad <em>without</em> a valid passport for a little while. Additionally, if renewing the passport for someone under the age of 16, <em>bring pictures of them</em> that show their growth from their last passport photo to their appearance <em>now</em>. The consulate might let you slide if the resemblance is uncanny, but be prepared - not having these could cause substantial delays.</p>

<p>To be safe, I'd allow at least two months. You might not be able to expedite it if you're out of the country, so keep that in mind. Otherwise, pay the extra fee, the worst that can happen is you get it sooner than expected.</p>

Why booking the flight in parts is cheaper than buying the whole flight at once? What's the catch?</p>
","<p>The catch is that if you book the tickets separately and then the flight from A to B is delayed, causing you to miss the flight from B to C, <em>it becomes your problem</em> to arrange for alternative transport from B to C. The airline has no obligations towards you, even if it was their own delayed flight that caused the issue. Worse still, if the B->C ticket had a return C->B that will likely be cancelled as well since you missed the first flight on the ticket.</p>

<p>If you had booked the entire trip as a single ticket, the airline would however be responsible for getting you to C if the earlier flight was delayed. This may include putting you up (for free) in a hotel overnight if there are no more flights to C on that day.</p>

<p>Of course, the airline may exceed their obligations and put you on a later flight at no or little cost to you. But the only way to be sure that failed connection will not result in significant additional cost is to book the trip as a single ticket. Budget airlines, in particular, are unlikely to show you any flexibility.</p>

<p>Another consideration (which may not be relevant in the question here as it is the same airline, but applies to connections between different airlines) is that you may need to claim and recheck your luggage at B.

In Frankfurt, I only have 54 minutes between my flight to London. And that's if the flight is perfectly on schedule. Will things at the Casablanca airport be fine? And is 54 minutes (potentially less) enough time to go through security and board my next flight?</p>
","<p>You will be able to check your luggage all the way from Casablanca to Newark.  Lufthansa and United are closely related, and luggage transfers between them are not a problem.</p>

<p>If all three flights are on the same ticket then this will happen automatically - but it's worth checking the tags as they put it on the luggage to make sure.  It should have a list of the airports you're going through - ""FRA"", ""LHR"" and ""EWR"" on it.</p>

<p>If the flights are on different tickets then be sure to have a printout of the flight details with you, and they will be able to check it all the way through - but you will have to ask for it!  At a minimum you'll need the confirmation number, but it's worth having the full details (ticket number, confirmation number, flight numbers, etc)</p>

<p>You will be required to collect your luggage in Newark regardless of your final destination as it's your first entry point into the US, however if you are continuing you can still get the luggage tagged to your final destination in Casablanca, which will make re-checking it easier.</p>

<p>Lufthansa check-in staff in Casablanca will be fluent in English, German, as well as the local languages so you should not expect any language issues.</p>

<p>Neither Morocco nor the UK are part of the Schengen region, so your transfer in Frankfurt is basically an international to international transfer, and there is no need to go through immigration.  54 minutes is cutting it a little fine, especially as FRA has a habit of using buses to get passengers to/from flights - but presuming you're on time (and especially if both flights are in the same terminal which they probably will be) then you should be fine.</p>

<p>So here are my questions based on that 7-day exemption clause:</p>

<ul>
<li>Does the ""onward air tickets"" stipulation apply when flying from and returning to Malaysia, or would it only apply if we were flying on to another country entirely?</li>
<li>If ""onwards air tickets"" may not apply in that situation, does flying back to Malaysia via Macao or mainland China permit her to enter without a visa?</li>
<li>Does simply entering mainland China without flying (for example, using the Hong Kong–Shenzhen Western Corridor to drive there) also entitle her to this entry?</li>
</ul>

<p>I have contacted the Chinese embassy in Malaysia about these questions, but they advised me that they do not know the answer to them (which I find a little surprising).</p>
","<p>My reading of that -- and I'm obviously not a Chinese immigration bureaucrat -- is that she's <em>probably</em> OK without the visa, as long as you can make the trip out to be Malaysia->China->Malaysia via Hong Kong on both legs.</p>

<ul>
<li>From Malaysia to Hong Kong, as long as she claims to be going to Shenzhen or wherever, she is ""in transit through Hong Kong"" and ""will go for mainland China"", so the onward air ticket from HK should not be necessary.</li>
<li>From Hong Kong back to Malaysia, she fulfills the conditions of ""possession of valid visa for the destination and confirmed onward air tickets for the overseas journey"".</li>
</ul>

<p>However, I would have at least three concerns:</p>

<ol>
<li>This scheme is meant for transiting via HK to/from mainland China, but she's not transiting, she's staying in HK.  Even a day-trip over the border to (say) Shenzhen would allow her to fulfill the letter of the law and also sort out her HK immigration records.</li>
<li>She may be asked for some sort of proof that she's actually going to China, not just Hong Kong.  A hotel booking or something in Shenzhen wouldn't hurt, and if you're <em>not</em> joining her in China for visa reasons etc, you'll probably want to go through immigration separately so your presence doesn't raise questions.</li>
<li>The airline has to buy into this plan as well, so I would strongly recommend calling the airline and confirming, ideally in writing, that they will let her on board without a visa.</li>

<p>A visa may not be issued to a woman under 30 years old travelling without her husband or father.Normally, there are no age-related restrictions. However, the UAE Government may sometimes impose restrictions for young lonely women. But a woman under 30 will have a visa issued without problems if she is travelling with her husband or father having the same last name.

"Which airline/alliance have cheap children's fares?","24529","","<p>Most airlines charge almost adult fares to children over 2. I have twins, who turned 2 last year and looking into ticket prices, really hurts. I know of airlines in South America that charge per kilogram of a passenger's total weight (luggage and personal weight). But unfortunately this fare system hasn't made it to Europe yet.</p>

<p>So my question is, if you are traveling with (small) children, which airlines should have my preference from a budget perspective?</p>
","<p>Many airlines do offer discounted tickets for children between the ages of 2-12 and fares are typically 2/3rds to 3/4ths of a full adult fare. Because the number of tickets is limited and airlines offering such rates on various routes aren't the same, the best advice I can give is to try a search on travel sites like <a href=""http://www.skyscanner.net"" rel=""nofollow"">SkyScanner</a>, <a href=""http://www.travelocity.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Travelocity</a>, <a href=""http://www.orbitz.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Orbitz</a> et al (<a href=""http://www.kayak.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Kayak</a> is a surprising omission because it offers no way of choosing children / senior travellers) and specify you're travelling with children. In this particular case, you will be better off search with 'online travel agents' like Travelocity than 'search engines' like Kayak, as the former are more likely to offer special deals negotiated with airlines for children.</p>

"Is it more expensive to buy airline tickets together than separate?","24509","","<p>I'm looking for tickets in despegar.com (a travel website for the American continent) and found out that a flight for just one person was about USD $350 incluiding all taxes, and I did the exact same search but instead of 1 person I chose 2 and the price for both tickets was USD $1200 (USD $600 each).</p>

<p>I thought this could be an error in the website, so I tried diferent dates and destinations getting the similar results.</p>

<p>Therefore I'm wondering if it is cheaper to buy airline tickets separately? </p>

<p>PS: The market price for the ticket I mentioned in the above example is about USD $600, so I'd love to take advantage of the USD $350 deal, but I'm afraid I might not find another ticket for my partner in the same flight.</p>
","<p>In general you shouldn't see what you're seeing here - especially for multiple dates, which makes me think that it's possibly either a website error, or a scam of some form.</p>

<p>Airlines do have multiple prices for each flight, and a limited number of seats available in each class.  ie, one specific flight might have 5 seats available for $100, another 10 seats for $200, another 10 for $400, and the remaining seats for $600.  The earlier you book, the better your chances of getting the lower fares.  Over time they may change the number of seats in each class - such as if the flight has a lot of free seats and they aren't selling at the top prices they might move them back down to the lower levels.*</p>

<p>If it happens that there's exactly 1 seat left at a particular price, and you try and buy 2 seats, most travel websites will bump BOTH tickets up to the higher price. So based on what you're seeing it's possible that there's only 1 seat left at $350, and trying to get 2 bumps you up to the $600 price.  However the odds of that being the case on multiple dates is low.</p>

<p>In general the cheapest place to buy airfares within the US is the airline itself. If you check there do you see the same low price you're seeing on despegar.com?</p>

<p><i>*This is an oversimplification of how things actually work, but it's close enough for you to get the idea.  Google for airline inventory management for more details.</i></p>

"Attending an academic conference is what type of travel?","24251","","<p>I am planning to travel to Portugal to attend an academic conference and in that regard needed a short-stay Schengen visa. The visa application has a field ""Purpose of Travel"" with the following options:<br></p>

<ul>
- Business<br>
- Sports<br>
- Cultural<br>
- Other<br>
- Study<br>
- Visiting family or friends<br>
- Medical reasons<br>
- Official visit<br>
- Transit<br>
- Airport transit<br>
- Tourism<br>
</ul>

<p>I am attending the conference to present the research I am conducting as a part of my PhD. So ""Study"" is the closest in my opinion. But I don't want the Embassy to misconstrue that it is for studying at a university in Portugal. In that case, would ""Business"" be the right option to choose?</p>
","<p>Annex II of the Schengen Visa Code (EU <a href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32009R0810"">regulation 810/2009</a>) includes a non-exhaustive list of “supporting documents” that sheds some light on the categories. Here are the most relevant bits:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li><p>for business trips:</p>
  
  <p>(a) an invitation from a firm or an authority to attend meetings, conferences or events connected with trade, industry or work; […]</p>
  
  <p>(c) entry tickets for fairs and congresses, if appropriate; […]</p>
  
  <p>(e) documents proving the applicant’s employment status in the company;</p></li>
  <li><p>for journeys undertaken for the purposes of study or other types of training:</p>
  
  <p>(a) a certificate of enrolment at an educational establishment for the purposes of attending vocational or theoretical courses within the framework of basic and further training;</p>
  
  <p>(b) student cards or certificates of the courses to be attended;</p></li>
  <li><p>for journeys undertaken for the purposes of tourism or for private reasons: […]</p></li>
  <li><p>for journeys undertaken for political, scientific, cultural, sports or religious events or other reasons:</p>
  
  <p>invitation, entry tickets, enrolments or programmes stating (wherever possible) the name of the host organisation and the length of stay or any other appropriate document indicating the purpose of the journey;</p></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Those are just examples but it's clear that “study” is definitely out, it means something quite different and you won't have any of the documents listed. Both “business” and “cultural” could fit, the former seems pretty safe especially if you are employed by the university where you are pursuing a PhD (do submit documents to that effect).</p>

<p>If you are still unsure, you could also simply check “other” and write “academic conference” to prevent any misunderstanding. It's important to be forthcoming about your purpose and to submit as much relevant documentation as possible but, unlike some other countries, the Schengen area does not have strictly defined visa categories. The category is there to help processing, your visa will not mention “business” or “culture” and it won't be checked at the conference or anything (this does happen in some other places like Colombia).</p>

<li><strong>Sail</strong>: more expensive, slower (at least 2 days &amp; 2 nights), more unreliable &amp; more unsafe compared to flying. But there are some very cool stops on the way, &amp; the sailing trips always includes stops at Komodo &amp; Rinca islands. Same thing, try to book in advance, a week or 2 should be fine.

<li><strong>PNI ferry</strong>: super cheap (190'000 IDR in 2015), only <strong>every 2 weeks</strong>, slow (30ich hours), unreliable, totally unsafe, &amp; very uncomfortable (packed). You probably do NOT want to do that! If you do, you can buy ticket at the official ticket office in the harbour.</li>

<h3>Once in Labuan Bajo</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>We predict a three day excursion </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What do you plan to do during those days? </p>

<p>Because Komodo national park is also very famous for its <strong>exceptional underwater life</strong>, so many people do a mix of land excursion (1 day for Komodo &amp; Rinca island) to see the dragons &amp; underwater adventures by diving or snorkeling (1 to 3 days usually) to see Manta Rays, turtles, sharks and more.</p>

<p>Note that it's worth diving in most sites, snorkelling is fine to see the Manta Rays &amp; nice corals but to see more you want to scuba dive. Having at least a PADI open water before going is best, otherwise you will only be allowed on shallow dive sites (10 or 12m deep I believe).</p>

<p>You can be based in Labuan Bajo (a bit of a ugly, smelly, &amp; dusty town) &amp; go every day for an adventure. ie. one day exploring Komodo &amp; Rinca island, then 2 days diving. In 2015, accommodation in LB starts at 100'000 IDR for a double room, day excursion to Komodo &amp; Rinca costs somewhere like 800'000 IDR (, and a day dive (3 dives) costs around 1.2 millions (+ 175'000 IDR park entrance fee for each day). So a total close to <strong>4 millions IDR</strong> (100'000 x 3 + 800'000 + 1'200'000 x 2 + 175'000 x 2). That's a lot of money for Indonesian standards but you'll have a blast.</p>

<p>Another solution is to jump on a liveaboard trip (3 days should be enough but do longer if you want to dive more), also going to Komodo &amp; Rinca island but also doing all the dives. This would be more expensive, in 2015 prices start at 600 USD for 3 days (around <strong>8 millions IDR</strong>) but it'd definitely be a much more awesome experience. Apart from the fun/pleasure of being on a sailing boat in an incredible place, you'd have the advantage of being able to dive early in the morning (7 or 8am) to enjoy the best conditions &amp; have the opportunity to do night dives. Oh, and you won't miss a thing by not seeing much (or anything) of Labuan Bajo.</p>

"Does a US immigration officer really have the power to deny entry to the country at personal will?","23544","","<p>Quite some comments exist that in the end it is the individual immigration officer that has the final call to let you enter the US or not and that there is no way of objecting that decision. </p>

<p>Given the major effects of such a decision - you have a denied entry on record, complicating future visits - I find it hard to believe that a single person has the power to bring such much havoc to others. I can't believe you get denied entry because the immigration officer might have some domestic issue.</p>

<p>So is it an urban myth, or does entering a country remain some sort of lottery?</p>

<p>The key para within this is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(2) to arrest any alien who in his presence or view is entering or
  attempting to enter the United States in violation of any law or
  regulation made in pursuance of law regulating the admission,
  exclusion, expulsion, or removal of aliens, or to arrest any alien in
  the United States, if he has reason to believe that the alien so
  arrested is in the United States in violation of any such law or
  regulation and is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained
  for his arrest, but the alien arrested sh all be taken without
  unnecessary delay for examination before an officer of the Service
  having authority to examine aliens as to their right to enter or
  remain in the United States</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They have the powers to deny you entry but this again is tracked, recorded and in most situations the immigration officers are very vigilant not  to allow their personal beliefs and apprehensions dilute the facts of the case at hand. It is true that they might not be polite with you or behave in manner showing respect - but when it comes to denying entry - they would be very careful not to be seen as biased or prejudiced.</p>

<p>One has ability to <a href=""http://www.uscis.gov/about-us/report-uscis-misconduct/report-uscis-employee-misconduct"">contact legal agencies and USCIS in case of apparent misconduct</a>.</p>

<p>This would then become a fight which one can take it to a finish if one is committed enough. But yes as mentioned in the question here - there are chances of one being denied entry with no proper reasons which depends on the type of immigration officer one encounters</p>

<p>So as to sell alcohol, stores, bars, restaurants, etc. have to pay quite high taxes. This explains why you will not find alcohol everywhere in every possible place. However, around tourist spots, you will not have much trouble to find some.  </p>

<p>Note that there are local beers in Morocco. The country is also producing wine, which is not exclusively meant for exportation ... You can even find some really good wine. </p>

My brother did the check out and turned in his room key card, but I forgot to turn mine in and didn't realize it until I was already at the airport.</p>

<p>What do I do about this? I'm not sure if it still works or not, or if it has any value to the hotel. Do I mail the room key card back to the hotel? Or do I just recycle the card?</p>
","<p>Recycle the card however you wish.  Those things are ephemeral and can't be used anyway after you check out and the hotel probably buys them in bulk.</p>

<hr>

<p>And by ""can't be used"", I mean that your checkout date is encoded onto the card key and the room locks will reject any attempt to open the door past an expired checkout date in the same manner that you can't open someone else's door while you are at the hotel (or your own effin door half the time while you are still checked in).</p>

<p>That does not mean these keys can't be re-programmed with new room or checkout information.  If you pay attention you will see the desk clerk shove the room key into a small box with a numeric key pad and hit a few keys et voilà you have a freshly programmed key ready to use (again). However if the key is physically damaged and won't take the reprogramming then the next stop is for it the rubbish bin. Here is a random link that claims to explain how these keys work <a href=""http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/travelbuzz/496181-hotel-key-card-systems-explained.html"">Hotel Card Key Systems Explained</a></p>

<p>This of course raises the question of how easy it is to program a key in order to enter a room that is not yours.  The funny thing is that while obvious, this question is actually moot as it is trivial to attack the lock itself with a simple electronic tool that exploits a fundamental design flaw in the how the locks themselves are programmed. Such a tool allows you to open all such locks with ease. I'll leave tracking down that exploit to the interested reader</p>

<p>Hotels are aware of this flaw, but it is going to be a long time before they roll out new door locks for every door that uses this style of pass key.  Especially as a lot of hotels can't even seem to keep up with regular maintenance of normal in-room equipment.</p>

","<blockquote>
  <p>I'm living in a high populated area (at least for NZ's standard) in Auckland, but the question goes for the whole country.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. Except in exceptional circumstances, NZ tapwater is universally safe to drink. Standards exist to ensure that major contaminating organisms such as Protozoa and Cryptosporidium are removed or reduced to safe levels. </p>

<p>Auckland water comes from two mains sources. West Auckland and some other parts of Auckland receive water from the Waitakere ranges catchment. Other areas receive water from the Hunua catchment and via pipeline from the Waikato river. The Waikato water is heavily contaminated at source and is treated to achieve requisite standards. </p>

<p>Auckland water is among the ""softest"" in NZ and better than most available in major cities internationally. eg whereas car batteries usually specify distilled water for topping up it is safe to use Ak tap water for this purpose. </p>

<p>There are variations between regions but these are mostly related to the nature of the water source. All NZ tap water is chlorinated.</p>

<p>About half of all NZ tapwater is fluoridated, with exceptions where local action has seen removal of fluoride from the water. Some consider fluoridation a negative measure with respect to health. The majority opinion sees it as a positive. The debate continues. </p>

<li>The use of water fluoridation first began in New Zealand in Hastings in 1954. A Commission of Inquiry was held in 1957 and then its use rapidly expanded in the mid 1960s.[96] New Zealand now has fluoridated water supplied to about half of the total population.[97] Of the six main centres only Christchurch[98] and Tauranga[99] do not to have a fluoridated water supply. In 2013 a Hamilton City Council committee voted to remove fluoride from late June 2013.[100] A referendum was held during the council elections in October 2013 with approximately 70% of voters voting for fluoride to be added back into the water supply. The mayor and most councilors have indicated that they will support the outcome of the referendum.[101] In a 2007 referendum about half of voters in the Central Otago, South Otago and the Southland Region did not want fluoridation[102] and voters in the Waitaki District were against water fluoridation for all Wards.[103] Ashburton and Greymouth also voted against fluoridation.[104]</li>

<p>I'm not familiar with UK immigration law, and given that this probably isn't too common a situation, the UK Border Agency website doesn't have an answer that I can can find, nor do they seem to have a contact form that fits my situation, so here's hoping someone knows—given that I'm a British National (Overseas), am I required to enter the UK on my UK passport, or can I just use my (valid) US passport?</p>
","<p>Firstly keep in mind that the answer to this question will vary significantly depending on the countries involved.</p>

<p>Some countries (eg, the US) have requirements that if you are a citizen you MUST enter using the passport of that country.  So as a US/UK citizen you must always use your US passport when entering the US.</p>

<p>The UK does NOT have such a requirement. ie, you can enter the country using either your US or UK passports - as long as the passport you use is valid for the type of trip.  eg, if you were planning to be in the UK for the next year, then you could not enter on your US passport, as a US citizen can not legally stay in the UK for that long without a visa.</p>

<p>Where this gets messy is what your status is within the UK if you enter using a foreign passport.  It could be claimed that you are in the UK as a visiting US citizen, and thus benefits such as government health care/etc might not be available to you.  Realistically the probability of this being an issue are low, but possible...</p>

"How can I avoid ordering multiple bottles of water at a restaurant?","23325","","<p>I have a couple esophageal conditions that result in a high probability of a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophageal_food_bolus_obstruction"" rel=""noreferrer"">food bolus impaction</a> when eating (a food bolus impaction is when <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3099357/"" rel=""noreferrer"">food gets stuck in the esophagus</a>). There are a few precautions I take when eating to reduce the risk of food getting stuck in my esophagus, one of them being taking a drink with every swallow. Naturally, this means I consume a fair amount of water during a meal.</p>

<p>While traveling to France and Germany recently, I had a bit of a hard time getting enough water during my meal. I can't just ask for a pitcher of (tap) water like I can in the USA. In Europe, when you order water, you get bottled water<sup>1</sup>, and specifically requesting tap water is bad etiquette.</p>

<p>But one bottle of water isn't enough.</p>

<p>Is there a way I can request a sufficient supply of (still) water, without breaking etiquette rules?</p>

<p>The only option I've thought of is ordering multiple bottles of water (which, depending on the meal and the bottle size, could easily be 4+), but that's: expensive, potentially wasteful (if I order more than I need), and a little weird. I don't mind revealing my swallowing issues, though preferably if I must, I'd do so with a very concise explanation.</p>

<p><sub><sup>1</sup>And hopefully I remembered to ask for <em>still</em> water. Getting a food impaction when chasing food with carbonated water (or any kind of carbonation) is the <em>worst</em>.</sub></p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Wow, so tap water seems to be more common than I had thought in France. My initial assumption was based on my previous experience, in which I was eating at a restaurant in Paris (I can't recall it's name, but it was quite popular (but not expensive)). When I asked the waitress for tap water as my drink (and declined wine and other drink options), she was visibly shocked and upset. For the rest of the evening she either ignored me (and my wife), or if she had to interact with us, she had a permanent scowl directed at us. It was quite clear she fully expected us to order a ""proper"" drink. I assumed I had broken some kind of French etiquette rule due to this experience.</p>
","<ol>
<li><p>Your <em>in Europe</em> is an overgeneralization. But that does not solve your issue in individual cases. So:</p></li>

<p>Now I am well aware that there are other factors such was road works, traffic conditions, rest stops, etc. but would the travel times listed on Google Maps be an accurate estimate? </p>

<p>i.e. From Tokyo Tower to Hachiman Shrine, can I expect it to take at least 14 h 28 min on a perfect non-interrupted drive with the route Google Maps suggests?</p>
","<p>I've found (anecdotally) that initially in London, the walking times were way too slow - I was beating the times regularly.</p>

<p>Then I moved to Vancouver and found them too fast.  I'm a quick walker, so wasn't sure what was happening.</p>

<p>I eventually figured it was down to knowledge.  I 'knew' London far better, and even though I might be using a map, I could navigate the crowds, the streets and so on far better than in Vancouver, where I was regularly having to check landmarks.  </p>

<p>When it comes to driving, the Google Maps times are best possible times.  So it's assuming you can drive at basically the speed limit all the time.  It gives no thought to inevitable traffic problems (they're improving that, especially in cities, but it's not there yet), and as you've pointed out won't handle rest times.</p>

<p>I drove from Melbourne to Sydney (Australia) this year and the times were definitely low.  I wanted to stop for lunch, or briefly check out some sightseeing spots, sure, but even the sections where I was just driving (week day, during the day) in a car I wasn't used to, on roads I wasn't used to, the estimates weren't ideal.</p>

<p>Perhaps if you speed, or are really used to driving on Japanese roads it'd be more accurate, but currently it's a best-case, for the most part.</p>

<p>(disclaimer: this post will outdate as Google improves, but that's the situation to the best of my knowledge currently)</p>

<p>EDIT: Someone did a pretty good breakdown, and a discussion follows, on this topic on reddit (it was about why speeding seemed to match the accuracy).  Some of the discussion will be of interest:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1u5yyg/eli5_when_i_get_driving_directions_from_google"">ELI5: When I get driving directions from Google Maps, the estimated time is usually fairly accurate. However, I tend to drive MUCH faster than the speed limit. Does Google Maps just assume that everyone speeds? How do they make their time estimates?</a></p>

"What is the cheapest way of traveling from Berlin to Krakow?","23238","","<p>A friend suggested going by bus to Poznan and from there by train to Krakow.</p>

<p>He said there is no particular reason to go to Poznan, but as whole it's a nice trip. You get to know a bit of Poland and a city that otherwise you would never visit. The price compared to an airplane trip is almost the same. From Poznan to Krakow it's possible to travel at night saving the price of the hotel/hostel.</p>

<p>Time is not an issue.</p>

<p>Is this a good idea? would it be better/cheaper just to fly to Krakow?</p>

<p>Hitchhiking is not an option. Even having time I need to know in advance how much time I will spend travelling.</p>
","<p>Via the <a href=""http://www.bahn.de/i/view/overseas/en/index.shtml"">webiste of the German Railways (bahn.de)</a>, it is possible to book a bus from Berlin to Krakow for 29 EUR, even for a departure on a (very) short notice (read: tomorrow). The price for a regular train ticket is 61 EUR. Eurolines will charge you about the same. The travel time by bus or train is 9 - 10 hours. By train you have to change once. The typical routing is via Warsaw.  </p>

<p>The plane is more expensive. Air Berlin has direct flights from Berlin to Krakow. One-way fares start at about 100 EUR, even for a departure at short notice (in a week or so).  Travel time is 1h20. </p>

<p>Regarding Poznan, it is an underrated destination in Poland. It's definitely worth a stop. Note that all the trains from Warsaw to Berlin stop in Poznan too. </p>

<p>It is indeed possible to travel on a night train from Poznan to Krakow. I don’t think that you will save a lot of money by doing that (if any at all). The major advantage of the night train is the time saving. You can leave Berlin in the late afternoon and you will arrive in Krakow early in the morning. Traveling by day you will leave in the morning and arrive in the evening. On the other hand it can be pleasant to spend an evening in Krakow and sleep in a real bed.</p>

"Am I going to have trouble flying with a reversed name on the ticket?","22869","","<p>I'm flying to Peru with my girlfriend next week and I realized that her name is incorrect on the reservation.</p>

<p>Instead of <em>Sally Marie Jones</em> it's <em>Jones Marie Sally</em>.</p>

<p>We're flying into Houston, then Lima, and in Lima we switch airlines for our flight to Cajamarca.</p>

<p>I booked the ticket with Orbitz who made the reservation with United. United booked the flight with LAN air, the Peruvian airline.</p>

<p>Both companies say that they are unable to change the name because of TSA restrictions not allowing a name change. I asked if I could just cancel and re-book, but United said they could not do this because there are multiple airlines involved.</p>

<p>A note has been attached to the reservation explaining the issue, and the United rep said that they would be able to print her boarding pass with the correct name. However, he said there are no guarantees that she'll be able to fly because although the boarding pass will be correct, the ticket will still have the reversed name.</p>

<p>I was prepared to just take the chance that it will all work out, seeing how it's really obvious the name is just backwards, but with recent events I'm worried that US airport security is going to be extra strict for the next little while.</p>

<p>Is this something I need to worry about, or are chances good that this will work out fine?</p>

<p>The United rep said there's a chance we could cancel the United flights and get a new ticket with the correct name for no cost, but we'd have to pay for new tickets within Peru ($500 out of the total $1300 ticket cost). I'd rather not do this unless there's a reasonable chance we'll have trouble at the airport.</p>
","<p><strong>It is at the discretion of the one checking your boarding pass</strong> but since they generally want you to have a good experience with them, obvious inacuracies are often let go.</p>

<p><strong>For a reversed name case, I really would not worry about it.</strong> All the parts are there and correctly spelled, so that would be easy to understand. Foreign airport personnel might not even notice.</p>

<p>Having flown well over 100 times I can say that I've only had one person who took issue because my name contains non-English characters which had been replaced by English ones and even so I was allowed in without much delay.</p>

","<p>The Southwest <a href=""http://www.southwest.com/html/customer-service/airport-experience/boarding-school/"" rel=""noreferrer"">website has a tutorial</a> on how their boarding process works. There are no assigned seats, but when you check in online you are assigned a boarding group and number. Groups are boarded in alphabetical order (so ""A"" is the first to board), and the number (like ""A-14"") indicates your spot in line within that group (here, the 14th person). There will be signs that tell you where to stand based on your number.

"Is there a difference between green traffic lights and blinking green traffic lights?","22755","","<p>At the moment, I'm driving around in Québec. I've noticed that the green traffic light can be blinking or constant. I assumed that I'm allowed to drive in both situations. However, is there any difference? My first guess was that the blinking light indicates that I have to be careful when left turning because of traffic from the opposite direction, but this does not always to be true.</p>

<p>So what exactly is the difference?</p>
","<p>In Québec, a flashing green traffic light means that no cross-traffic can go, even 
the traffic on the same road coming from the other direction has a red light. This means that (if allowed) you can make a left turn without having to yield (except possibly to pedestrians in the cross street). See e.g. <a href=""http://www.virtualamericas.net/canada/travel/transport.shtml"">this</a> or <a href=""http://www.montrealpascher.ca/permis.html"">this</a> advice on the peculiarities of driving in Québec.</p>

<p>This is apparently purely indicative since <a href=""http://www2.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/dynamicSearch/telecharge.php?file=/C_24_2/C24_2.htm&amp;type=3"">the Québec traffic code</a> doesn't distinguish flashing and solid green lights (§363).</p>

<p>Note that in some other Canadian provinces, such as British Columbia, <a href=""http://blog.webfoot.com/2006/11/22/flashing-green-lights/"">flashing green lights have a different meaning which allows cross-traffic</a>.</p>

<p>On a related topic, note that a flashing red indicates that you must mark a stop, but may then proceed after yielding to all traffic that reached the intersection ahead of you: a flashing red is equivalent to a stop sign. On a solid red, you must wait for the light to change. As an exception, in Québec like in most of North America, you may make a right turn on a solid red after marking a stop and yielding to all traffic; however some municipalities forbid right turns on red.</p>

"Are there consequences to stamps in my passport that are not from border control?","22541","","<p>I’m on a trip in Japan. I've seen many touristic places that offer stamps, many temples have it as a free souvenir. This is not the first time I’ve seen this type of souvenir, I also saw the same stamps at The Tall Ships Races 2012 Lisboa. It was a big concentration of tall sails ships. There every ship had a stamp for a fake Passport, mostly for kids.</p>

<p>I would like to know if I stamp my passport with one of this stamps I will have problems of any kind with border security?</p>

<p>samples of stamps:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AHF1I.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>Your passport is an official government document, and when marked for any non-official purposes (like collecting a souvenir stamp), you are technically defacing or altering it. <em>In theory</em> you could have it voided (<a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1543"">or worse</a>), or <em>in theory</em>, an immigration official could refuse to admit you if they believed that it was a signal the document was in any way invalid.</p>

<p>In practical terms, there are many places in the world that issue many thousands of unofficial stamps. I know they are popular to get at Checkpoint Charlie, various Antarctica stations, Timbuktu, Easter Island, and other iconic world locations. I got one myself at Machu Picchu, which raised no eyebrows at any of the half-dozen countries I visited subsequent to Peru. I've never heard any firsthand accounts of problems, and tend to think that if it were indeed a serious issue, the guidebooks and State Department advisories would include a mention of it.</p>

<p>On the other hand, that stamp was the only non-official one— and what <em>does</em> hold you up at immigration is a passport full of unusual stamps. The more of these meaningless stamps you collect, the longer it takes for the agent to find a blank page, and the more likely s/he'll think something is ""off"" and refer you to the most persnickety bureaucrat you've ever encountered.</p>

<hr>

<p>While it's cool to have a full passport, I try not to think of mine as a souvenir. Above all, it is a working document that I need in order to travel. Some countries require entire pages to be blank before they will issue you a visa; I've had some flip through to find a blank page just to stamp me in. As a result, I'm extremely wary of filling up any more squares or pages than strictly necessary— and I only travel internationally once or twice a year.</p>

<p>For souvenir stamps such as those you collect at museums, temples, national parks, hostels, <a href=""http://kybourbontrail.com/map/kentucky-bourbon-trail-passport/"">distilleries</a>, and so on, I would simply invest in a small journal or passbook. These don't expire, aren't subject to the whims of any officious officials, and are entirely yours to mark up however you wish.</p>

"Is it rude to give up your seat in Japan?","22375","","<p>I heard that in Japan it may be considered rude to give up your seat for someone else while you are on a train or bus, because it would make the other person feel in debt with you. Is this true?<br>
(Of course ""priority seats"" like elders or pregnant women are another matter)</p>
","<p><strong>I live in Japan and every day commute with trains and metro. And can assure you that nobody will think you are rude by offering the seat.</strong></p>

<p>From my personal experience:</p>

<p>I have a rule to always give up my seat to</p>

<ul>
<li>Disabled/injured people</li>
<li>Pregnant women (in Japan they wear a badge like this <a href=""http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/41977000/jpg/_41977426_baby_japan203.jpg"">http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/41977000/jpg/_41977426_baby_japan203.jpg</a>)</li>
<li>Elderly women and man</li>
<li>People with huge bags; often you'll see women with gigantic, heavy bags they carry from shops</li>
</ul>

<p>The only thing is that I will confirm - many elderly people turn down the offer. Sometimes because they go out in the next station, sometimes they just don't want to. But in any case they will give you a polite response.</p>

<p>I actually feel more pressure to stay near the seat I've given up, because Japanese will thank you many-many times after taking the seat and I feel shy of such attention for such a trivial thing.</p>

<p>So long story short - feel free to show your kindness and don't over-think about some people seeing it as rudeness. Especially in Japan where people are usually very polite.</p>

<p>And I want to add that the cities you mentioned have high relative humidity, and you will probably need a warm hat or a headband:</p>

"Should one bring a power strip when travelling from the U.S. to Europe so that one won't have to get more than one power adapter?","22297","","<p>Since then you could presumably plug the power strip into the power adapter and then not have to get multiple power adapters?</p>

<p>Or is this unnecessary?</p>
","<p>Traveling with a power-strip is an old trick for avoiding to carry multiple plug adaptors, but going from the US to Europe you need to be a little careful.</p>

<p>Electricity in the US is ~110 volts, whilst in much of the rest of the world it's 200-250 volts.</p>

<p>Although power boards/power strips are generally passive, and thus the number of volts should not have any impact, many of them do include various types of fuses or additional circuitry (eg, USB ports) that could potentially have issues with higher voltages.  If you were to plug multiple high-current devices into a power board (eg, a hair dryer) it's also possible that you could draw more watts than the board is designed to support.</p>

<p>There are a few products that are specifically designed for travel, and designed to support both 110 and 240 volts, such as the <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000F9YN2M"">Monster Outlets to Go</a> range (Note: Amazon doesn't say it, but the manufacturer has confirmed that these items are designed for up to 250 volts)</p>

<p>Note that going the other way is far less of a problem - a power board designed for 250 Volts will work fine in the US - I have several where I have taken an Australia power strip, removed the Australian plug and put on a US plug so I don't even need an adapter to use it!</p>

"Refundable Flight Ticket in Malaysia Airlines?","22278","","<p>In Malaysia Airlines which plan (mhbasic/mhsmart/mhflex)  provides refundable ticket? </p>
","<p>The exact rules will actually vary slightly depending on the city pairs. On the Malaysia Airlines website, on the <em>Review Your Itinerary and Price</em> page there's a small link at the top for <em>View Fare Rules</em>. You can use that to check exactly what the rules would be for an given ticket you were thinking of buying</p>

<p>As a general rule though, mhbasic is the least flexible, then mhsmart, then mhflex.</p>

<p>Looking at a random mhbasic fare, I see things in the fare rules like:</p>

<ul>
<li>changes any time - charge gbp 100.00 for reissue/revalidation</li>
<li>changes ticket reissue - rebooking / rerouting after ticketing- the above charge plus fare difference</li>
<li>ticket is non-refundable in case of cancel/refund</li>
</ul>

<p>So for that one, you can make changes to it for a £100 fee plus any extra fare costs at the time of the change, but you can't have any money back if you cancel.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>Then looking at a random mhflex fare, I see things in the fare rules like:</p>

<ul>
<li>changes ticket reissue -  rebooking / rerouting after ticketing permitted with no fees plus fare difference</li>
<li>cancellations permitted for cancel/refund. admin fee applies.</li>
<li>after departure - cancellations permitted for cancel/refund. note - deduct the applicable one way fare in same or higher rbd and cancellation fee - if any- and refund the balance if any.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, on that particular ticket, the mhflex ticket is refundable before departure for a small fee, and after departure less  the cost of a one-way for what you've already used (which may mean there's nothing to refund)</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>There is no universal answer, it'll depend on the city pairs, but mhflex is likely to be the one you need for full flexibility and near-refundable-ness. Check the fare rules for the full details / speak to a travel agent who can understand them and explain them to you!</p>

"When and why do people clap/applause after a plane lands?","22178","","<p>On a recent flight to Romania, the whole flight erupted with applause once we'd landed.  This wasn't a ""difficult"" flight - no turbulence, delays, or hijackings.  Just a bog standard flight.</p>

<p>On the return flight to London, no one applauded.</p>

<p>However, when I flew to and from Jamaica lots of people applauded.  Again, a fairly routine flight.</p>

<p>Are there traditions in some countries around clapping?  Can airline staff predict who is likely to applaud?</p>
","<p>A cabin crew member here, and I am from a country where people do not clap after landings and I was very surprised when I experienced this for the first time, so I started asking passengers when this happens on different flights. Basically there are three main reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A sign of <strong>appreciation</strong>: the smoother the flight/landing, the stronger the clapping. You know, clapping is cheaper and more feasible than sending the crew flowers. </p></li>
<li><p>A sign of <strong>happiness</strong> for safely landing. The harder the flight was, the stronger the clapping will be. There could be other reasons as well behind ""happiness"", I am sure it happened with me when no one expected it to happen, but in general it happens on certain flights with certain communities on a regular basis.</p></li>
<li><p>A sign of <strong>excitement</strong> for reaching home. Seen this in flights where most of the passengers are expats arriving home after spending a long time away from home. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>The three above situations happen more when arriving home, not when going away from home. That also was noticed.</p>

<p>I guess in some communities, this clapping thing became a tradition, Egypt for example. While the applause is mainly a sign of excitement, people from there do not need a reason to do so. You'll see passengers from all classes (even rich people in first class) will usually clap especially older ones regardless of the flight even if it was a one hour flight with no service and a hard landing!</p>

<p>There are also other less common reasons behind that. Sometimes crew announcements initiate that, as mentioned in the comment (the crew announced that this was the last flight before the captain's retirement), another announcement that I personally experienced when the captain announced the result of an important football match (he got the result from the ATC). </p>

"How to dress suitably for Jungfrau mountain sightseeing trip?","22102","","<p>I have planned to travel sightseeing at Jungfrau mountain in Switzerland.</p>

<p>Since I have checked with many weather forecast website on my trip date, they said the weather probably be cloudy, partly sunny and the temperature is about -5 °C.</p>

<p>I came from the warm climate (always hot) country, Thailand. So, I am not sure about how to dress suitably for the weather like this.</p>

<p>So, I would like to ask the suggestion for the way of dressing. Moreover, Do I need to bring any medicine to prevent or cure in some case?</p>
","<p>You did not really specify where exactly you want to go, but since you mentioned Jungfrau region, I assume that you're talking about <a href=""http://www.jungfraujoch.ch/"">Jungfraujoch</a>.</p>

<p>As Kathryn Hill already mentioned, it can get very cold up there. But this is not only the case in winter. Since it is around 3500 meters above sea level, it is cold year round up there. Even now in autumn, it can get as low as -20° C. And even in the highest summer season, the temperature might be around 0°C. So you should really be prepared for cold weather during the whole year.</p>

<p>I would recommend that you particularly focus on wearing warm shoes that are water-proofed so that you won't get wet socks. Nothing is nastier than wet-socks when it's cold out there. Furthermore, bring a warm cap with you and I'm sure you won't regret if you also bring gloves with you. I personally would also wear a warm jacket, especially one that stops the wind. If it's cold and windy, you will easily suffer from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_chill"">wind chill</a>. Trousers are not so important if you don't plan to lie or sit in the snow. In this case a normal jeans (if you prefer with long underwear as Kathryn Hill mentioned) is enough. Otherwise, I would recommend a waterproofed trouser.</p>

<p>Additionally, you should not forget to wear sunglasses. If the weather is nice, the sun is very bright and since on Jungfraujoch, there is snow all year round, the sunlight will be reflected heavily. For the same reason, also make sure to bring your sunscreen with you.</p>

<p>If you plan to walk in the snow, you could also borrow gaiters to prevent snow getting in your shoes.</p>

<p>Concerning your medical question: There are <a href=""http://www.jungfrau.ch/en/sommer/tourism/travel-information/medical-tips/"">medical hints</a> on the Jungfraujoch homepage. The biggest danger is altitude sickness. Altitude sickness is caused by the decreasing air pressure and oxygen level in higher altitudes. However, normally, the first symptoms of altitude sickness will not be visible before 6-12 hours, so, normally, this shouldn't be a problem in your case. However, I would recommend to read the medical hints to be on the safe side.</p>

When, if ever, will that happen? Do I get emailed an assignment as the trip gets closer, do I get one when I present my ticket at the gate, etc.?</p>
","<p>The distinction between a ""reserved coach seat"" and an ""unreserved coach seat"" is that they guarantee that there will be seats for all passengers with ""reserved"" seats but not for passengers with ""unreserved"" coach seats.  From the Amtrak website (bolding mostly mine):</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer?c=AM_Accommodation_C&amp;pagename=am%2FLayout&amp;cid=1248543007393"">Reserved Coach Seat:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While reserved coach seating is available on our long distance routes and many trains that travel short / medium distance routes, the train cars are different depending on where a train travels, so some of the amenities are different as well.  ... Advance reservations (by train, not by individual seat) are required. <strong>Once you make your reservation, a seat is guaranteed.</strong></p>

<p><a href=""http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer?c=AM_Accommodation_C&amp;pagename=am%2FLayout&amp;cid=1248543010831"">Unreserved Coach Seat:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Only a few short-distance trains have unreserved coach seating, where tickets are valid on any train unless restricted by the fare paid.</p>
  
  <p><strong>While seating is not guaranteed</strong>, unreserved coach seats have most of the features that reserved coach seats have...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The trains that have unreserved coach seats are Auburn (CA)–Sacramento–San Jose;  Milwaukee–Chicago;  Philadelphia—Harrisburg;  and San Luis Obispo–Santa Barbara–LA–San Diego.  I would guess that these lines are often used by commuters who want a little more flexibility in their train times.</p>

<p>As to how the boarding experience works:  You get on the train, find a seat, and stow your luggage.  Occasionally, the conductors will direct you to particular cars depending on your destination as you walk up to the train on the platform.  Once the train is underway again, the conductors will go through the cars and ask all new passengers to show their tickets.</p>

<li>The first thing they will sell you is the <em>chip</em>(SIM) which is around $30 ($6 USD).</li>
<li><p>Once the number is activated, which is instantly, you can charge your new number on any kiosk around the city. You will see signs with a legend like (""Cargamos Personal/Movistar/Claro"").

"What does this road sign mean? (Germany; red circle and X on a blue background, with a right-pointing arrow.)","21814","","<p>I'm driving for the first time in Europe—in Munich, Germany—and I came across an intersection where there seemed to a ""main"" signal above, straight ahead, and a ""side"" signal to the right, near the bicycle lane. This side signal had the aforementioned road sign affixed to its pole—a red circle and X on a blue background with a right-pointing arrow. I found an example on Google Images but the site itself is down so I can't learn more about it, and I can't find any other site with this road sign:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DBl5L.png"" alt=""unknown road sign""></p>

<p>Now, if this sign were standalone, there'd be less of a question about what it means. But here were my several thoughts:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It was a right turn from a smaller road to a main road, so it seemed unlikely that right turns wouldn't be allowed.</p></li>
<li><p>It was affixed to a side signal, so I thought it might mean to indicate that this side signal is a separate turn signal one should adhere to in order to make right turns (presumably to protect bicyclists and pedestrians).</p></li>
<li><p>A police car behind me, which I was nervously watching while waiting at the light, turned on <em>its</em> right-turn signal.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Was I in the right to make that right turn? (The police didn't stop me, but I heard that you just get ticketed in the mail for violations.)</p>
","<p>Provided there were no other sign or rule forbidding it, turning was perfectly fine. The red X cross on blue background means it's forbidden to stop (<em>absolutes Halteverbot</em>).</p>

<p>It's somewhat similar to the more well-known “no parking” sign, but stricter (parking is defined as leaving your vehicle or letting it stand longer than three minutes whereas this signs also covers shorter stops). <em>Waiting</em> because there is a traffic light, the conditions force you to come to a stop (traffic jam, emergency…) or the police orders it is explicitly allowed but <em>stopping</em> for any other reason (like letting someone get off your car) is not.</p>

<p>Arrows inside the circle are unrelated to any turn but specify the area of validity of the sign (it starts where there is a road-pointing arrow and ends where there is a an arrow pointing away from the road). In your case, and assuming the sign was placed on the right of the road, it would mean it's forbidden to stop before the sign (and the intersection).</p>

<p>I suspect it might have been affixed to another sign as a cost saving measure or to minimize obstruction and is completely unrelated to crossing rules for this intersection.</p>

Wild camping in Iceland is one of my ideas for the next summer. The question is what does it means ""stay away from houses""? And what should be understand as ""common sense""? For instance, if I rent a car to move along the island, may I stop at the side of the route with the car and camp? Of course, I'm not talking about the Ring Road. I'm thinking in secondary trails.</p>
","<p>The <a href=""http://www.visiticeland.com/"">""Visit Iceland"" website</a> has a page about your rights to camp in Iceland.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Camping with no more than three tents is allowed on uncultivated ground for a single night, unless the landowner has posted a notice to the contrary. However, campers should always use designated campsites where they do exist. Do not camp close to farms without permission. If a group of more than three tents is involved, these campers must seek permission from the landowner before setting up camp outside marked campsite areas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, if there is no sign, and the land isn't being used to grow things, you have the right to camp there for one night. That is pretty much all the law says. </p>

<p>So, yes you can camp at the side of the road, IF there is a place to park your car. You should not park your car on the land.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do not drive off the road or track. Motor vehicles can leave marks that last for generations. Driving off roads or tracks is against the law except when the ground is frozen and covered in snow. See further information under “Practical Information/Driving in Iceland”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Staying away from houses is just a basic courtesy. The best rule of thumb to follow in my experience is to never be close enough that you can see anything in the windows, and definitely stay away from gardens and obviously enclosed personal space. 300 meters at the minimum.</p>

There is no universal rule.</p>

<p>A couple of ways to determine this would be:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>visit a visa handling agency such as CIBT, etc who have offices and agents all over the globe.  Their visa inquiry forms often allow you to note where you are currently located;</p></li>
<li><p>do a web search for your destination's embassy in the country you plan to apply for the visa from, but keep in mind you may be searching for ""Embassy"", ""Consulate"", ""Honorary Consulate General"", as not every country maintains a full diplomatic mission in each country of the world.</p></li>

<p>If you want to avoid lines and crowds, arrive at least 45-60 minutes before the game's start time (or earlier with Club tickets) will help avoid the crowds. Here's what <a href=""http://www.thegarden.com/faq.html"">Madison Square Garden's website</a> says about open gate times: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Doors for Madison Square Garden Arena and Theater events open one hour
  prior to event start time. If you are attending a Knicks or Rangers
  game and are in possession of Club tickets, you may enter The Club Bar
  and Grill two hours prior to game time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alternatively, you can arrive some amount of time after the game to avoid the rush of everyone trying to catch the start of the game (e.g. 30 minutes after start time).</p>

<p><strong>2. Maximizing your NBA ""experience""</strong></p>

<p>If you want to spend the money, you can participate in a <a href=""http://www.nba.com/knicks/fan-experience"">several pre-game events</a> (shoot-around, etc.), but this may take some planning.  </p>

<p>Even without such official pre-game events, you may want to simply tour the surrounding neighborhood bars/stores, and having an extra hour or two to do this is good.  Of course, you do this after the game as well, depending what time the game ends, which in your case should be around 11pm. I don't know the area personally, so can't say what the neighborhood offers at this time of night.</p>

<p><strong>3. Getting most NBA experience in limited amount of time</strong></p>

<p>It could be that you don't want to dedicate half a day to the NBA game because you're only in town for a few days or whatever. In this case, I'd recommend considering arriving after the game starts (e.g. 30 minutes into the game). You'll miss the opening of the game where they announce all the players, but you'll still catch the end of the first half and end of the game, as well as have enough time to wander around the arena, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Last bit of advice:</strong>
I forgot to mention that arrival also depends on the day of the week.  A Friday or Saturday night game will generally be more crowded than Monday through Thursday night games, so adjust accordingly.</p>

"What is the purpose of this cloth in hotel?","21572","","<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fBt41.jpg"" alt=""hotel room before i trash it!!""></p>

<p>What is the purpose of the cloth across the bed? I see it at many hotels and it does not seem to serve any purpose other than make it look nice. Any idea what it can be used for?</p>

<p>Ps. The purplish elephant in foreground is towel. It looks nice!</p>
","<p>A bed runner is a small, long piece of decorated cloth used to enhance the appearance of an otherwise plain bed.  While some prefer the look solely for aesthetic reasons and would choose it even if it were more expensive than traditional decorative bedding, the primary reason to use one in the hospitality industry is to reduce costs while keeping the room attractive.</p>

<p>Plain white linen not only costs less initially, it's easy and cheaper to launder than decorative linen.  Delicate or decorative fabrics often can't be bleached, and are easily damaged by mechanical washing machines - they simply don't last as long.  However, white blankets, comforters, and bedspreads are easy to clean and sanitize, don't fade, and still look good even after many washing cycles.</p>

<p>Plain white linen doesn't look as attractive as a fully decorated bed, though.</p>

<p>So a bed runner, which is small and only used for decoration, will enhance the appearance of the room while not requiring frequent laundering (only when obvious spots appear), and , being small, are easy and cheaply manufactured. When they do need to be laundered, several of them can fit into a load, and that load can be run on a gentle cycle - the shear volume of bedclothes that must be laundered would prevent large bedspreads from this care, but the relatively smaller volume allows an occasional load of runners to take more time and perhaps a more expensive detergent process to clean without causing delays in resetting rooms.</p>

<p>Further, some hotel guests prefer clean white linen - which is easier to inspect and note stains or previous usage - to patterned linen for personal hygiene reasons.  Bed runners add touches of decoration while still exhibiting cleanliness for picky travelers.</p>

"Any way to find out what US Customs & Border Protection has in their database on me?","21378","","<p>I travel from the US to Canada occasionally (about once per year on average) with my family. We are all US citizens and travel with US passports. Every time we re-enter the United States, I am given extra scrutiny.</p>

<p>Most recently, we used an automated check-in procedure at the airport. These are terminals where you scan your passport &amp; fill out a customs declaration online and it prints a receipt which you take to the customs agent. When I got my receipt, it had a big ""X"" printed on it and we were directed to a line to talk to an agent.</p>

The agents also seem to examine my photo &amp; my face more closely than the other members of my family.</p>

<p>We get through customs OK, but it gives me a some anxiety. I suspect that there's someone out there with the same name (I have a pretty common name) who is on a ""no fly"" list or something.</p>

"What commercial flight route requires the most (minimum possible) stops/layovers from A to B?","21147","","<p>For travel hacking (and interest) value, colleagues and I have been trying to work out which routes worldwide might have the highest number of required legs.</p>

<p>That is, for a one-way flight from airport A to B, how many legs minimum are required to fly to B from A?</p>

<p>Eg: CHC to SYD, while you can go CHC->AKL->SYD (2), there are direct flights to SYD, so the minimum number of legs is 1.</p>

<p>Note: there is a practical flight hacking and novelty purpose.  Evidently in 1939 KLM listed 26 stops from AMS to SYD, and I'd love to go on the 'most number of stops' flight without stupidly just hopping around random airports.</p>

","<p>As with many questions about extremes, the answer depends on the precise rules you impose.</p>

<p><strong>Hops count as multiple flights: 13 flights.</strong>  It's reasonable to argue that one should be very permissive when finding record itineraries.  As such, the following 13-flight itinerary from SVR to SRV (a dyslexic's nightmare?) is one of the best single answers I know:</p>

</ol>

<p>Note that many of these flights are only offered one or two days a week, so the entire route is not particularly achievable together.  Google Flights is aware of all but the first flight, but doesn't let you book many of them; nonetheless, all of the flights can be booked online individually.  Note that this itinerary was shortened in the comments from 14 legs by using the seasonal flights in the middle; outside of the summer, it likely takes three legs to get from SFJ to ANC (eg, via CPH and LAX).</p>

<p>A quirk of this example is passing through Thule Air Base, which requires an access permit.  An alternative is to fly from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aappilattoq_Heliport_(Kujalleq)"">QUV Aappilattoq Heliport</a> near the southern tip of Greenland, though now Google Flights is unaware of the initial <em>four</em> flights (all on helicopters):</p>

<pre><code>QUV QFN JNN JJU UAK GOH KEF ANC ANI CHU CKD RDV SLQ SRV
</code></pre>

<p>Another quirk is its sensitivity to the direction of travel.  An alternative is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chignik_Bay_Seaplane_Base"">KBW Chignik Bay</a>, a five-hop trip on Grant Aviation either way:</p>

<pre><code>KBW KCL KCQ KPV PTH AKN ANC KEF SFJ UAK JJU JNN QFN QUV
KBW KCL KCQ KPV PTH AKN ANC KEF SFJ JAV JUV NAQ THU SVR
QUV QFN JNN JJU UAK GOH KEF ANC AKN PTH KPV KCQ KCL KBW
SVR THU NAQ JUV JAV SFJ KEF ANC AKN PTH KPV KCQ KCL KBW
</code></pre>

<p>If you forbid helicopters, then it seems one can replace the Greenlandic side with airplane flights on Air Inuit to/from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salluit_Airport"">YZG Salluit</a> (one of the northernmost Inuit communities) as suggested in another answer:</p>

<pre><code>KBW KCL KCQ KPV PTH AKN ANC DEN YUL YGL YPX AKV YIK YZG
YZG YIK AKV YPX YGL YUL DEN ANC AKN PTH KPV KCQ KCL KBW
YZG YIK AKV YPX YGL YUL DEN ANC ANI CHU CKD RDV SLQ SRV
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, KBW ↔ YZG is the only pair I know of which requires 13 flights in either direction, all on <em>fixed-wing</em> aircraft and all <em>individually</em> known by Google flights.  But KBW requires a seaplane and counting multiple hops as single flights, the trip can be done (with even <em>more</em> hopping) in a mere <em>five</em> flights!  (YZG → SRV only works in one direction, but requires neither a helicopter nor a seaplane.)</p>

<p><strong>Hops count as multiple flights, available together on Google Flights: 11 flights.</strong> I think there are many of these.  Here's one from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalaluddin_Airport"">GTO Jalaluddin</a> (Indonesia) to SRV, nearly 6000 miles geodesic distance:</p>

<p><strong>Hops count as one flight: 11 flights.</strong>  If you allow helicopters, I think there are many such itineraries, although they all share one half:</p>

<pre><code>AUY TAH VLI BNE BKK CPH SFJ JAV JUV NAQ THU SVR
SVR THU NAQ JUV JAV SFJ KEF YUL MIA LPB TDD RIB
</code></pre>

<p>If you forbid Thule Air Base specifically, then you drop down to <strong>9 flights</strong> by switching to southern Greenland (you lose two flights because of ""helicopter-hopping""):</p>

<pre><code>AUY TAH VLI BNE BKK CPH SFJ UAK JNN QUV
</code></pre>

<p>If you forbid helicopters entirely, you can achieve the same result of <strong>9 flights</strong> by chopping off the end of the SVR itineraries:</p>

<pre><code>AUY TAH VLI BNE BKK CPH SFJ JAV JUV NAQ
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Hops count as one flight, available on Google Flights: 8 flights.</strong>  If you only demand that Google Flights be aware of the individual flights, then you can cut off SVR from the trips in the previous category to get 10 flights (9 if you forbid helicopters).</p>

<p>If you want to be able to book the flights, then I can't get any more than 8 flights ... and I can't even get them all at once.  For example, for the following itineraries I can get a ticket for the first 7 flights, but I have to get the last segment separately:</p>

","<p>For international flights, the magic number is usually (but not always) <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/9533/when-does-the-24-hour-layover-rule-apply?rq=1"">24 hours</a>.  If your flights are less than 24 hours apart, it's a ""transit"" or a ""layover"" and it's free; if it's over 24 hours, it's usually ""stopover"" and you may need to pay extra.  Note that <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/7144/in-the-context-of-air-travel-are-layovers-different-to-stopovers"">these terms are not always used consistently</a> and it's not always 24 hours; I've seen up to 72 hour (3 day) connections on eg. China Southern, especially if one of the legs is not flown daily, while I gather on US domestic flights the window may be as low as 4 hours.</p>

<p>The problem is that <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/5556/modifying-online-flights-to-include-stopovers"">most online booking websites are really bad at booking stopovers</a>.  If you search for a roundtrip, they only show the ""free"" connections of less than 24 hours, and if you try to do a multi-city search for LAX-NYC-TXL-LAX, they'll usually do something stupid like add up three rack-rate one-ways and quote you ridiculous prices.</p>

<p>My usual approach is to search for my flights at <a href=""http://matrix.itasoftware.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ITA Matrix</a> (toggle ""Advanced routing codes"" and try eg. <code>LAX</code> to <code>TXL</code> with <code>X:NYC</code> in the outbound routing codes), find a fare where the fare conditions in the small print specifically allow a stopover for a low or zero fee, then take the printout to a travel agent and get them to book it with a stopover added in.  For example, searching for a 14-day trip in March, I can find a $1014 fare on United via Newark (EWR) that appears to allow stopovers.</p>

<p>And yes, this is usually <em>far</em> cheaper than booking flights separately.  For example, I had to fly Sydney-Tokyo-San Francisco last year, and three separate flights on the same route (3 one-way flights) would have cost me around 3x more than booking a SYD-SFO roundtrip with a stopover in Tokyo.</p>

I was scolded one time for bringing a shampoo container, but I was still ultimately allowed to bring that container through.</p>

<p>In any case, how often are liquids larger than 3 ounces ultimately confisticated, if I put them in a ziploc bag where they can be clearly seen?</p>
","<p>For the most part, the 3.4oz rule isn't strictly enforced, in the sense that they don't normally physically check ever single container you have to make sure that it's less than 3.4oz.  If it's significantly larger than 3.4oz they will normally be able to see that on the X-ray, and will physically inspect it.</p>

<p>As an example, I travel with a can of spray deodorant that is around 4oz, but is only labeled with ""100g"", where other cans of the same product are labeled as ""4oz (100g)"".  To date, having gone through airport security probably over 100 times (incl 5 times in the past 3 days) I've had them manually inspect it exactly twice.</p>

<p>So if what you're traveling with is close to 3.4oz, you're probably fine. However, if they decide to look at it, and it's over 3.4oz, then you'll almost certainly lose it.  It's up to you whether it's worth the risk/cost of losing whatever it is you're trying to take through.

I certainly can't find anything that would prevent you from doing so, there's similar threads over on <a href=""http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/practical-travel-safety-security-issues/470700-adult-child-bulletproof-vests-allowed-worn-carry-checked-luggage.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FlyerTalk</a> and <a href=""https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20110222223354AA8GCuP"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Yahoo! Answers</a> where people come to the same conclusion. Additionally there's at least one case of it <a href=""http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/man-odd-weapons-cache-plane-permissible-article-1.1180630"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">actually happening</a>. </p>

<p>However, as noted it those threads and the comments, you're going to attract a lot of attention during security where you will have to remove it. Just having a vest may not be that unusual but actually wearing one through security is almost certainly going to get you pulled over for additional screening and questions. </p>

<p>If you opt to put it on after security or on the plane itself I can see a few problems. One, although I've never worn one, I can't imagine they're the most comfortable things to wear and that doesn't sound like a recipe for a pleasant flight. Secondly, if it's obvious it may concern other passengers and the airline would be within their rights to ask you not to wear it. Finally, I'm assuming these are reasonably bulky and it may actually cause you problems in an emergency situation, another reason the flight crew may ask you to remove it. I know we have a lot of airline staff that post here so maybe one of them can come along and say how they'd react. </p>

<p>You say: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It makes sense to wear it in case someone try to hijack the plane.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it really doesn't. The chance of a hijack attempt is astonishingly unlikely (and even less likely for hijackers to have firearms). Even if it did happen is a vest going to help much? Either the hijackers plan to land and ransom the plane, in which case it generally makes sense to not shoot the passengers. Or they plan to crash the plane in which case a vest is not going to help much. Or the shooting ruptures something causing the plane to depressurize and crash anyway. </p>

<p>And, in the <em>extremely mindbogglingly unlikely</em> case that someone starts shooting on a plane you'll most likely to be sitting down and your head will be more likely to be in the firing line ... unless you're planning to engage with the hijackers which is a <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/25481/what-should-i-do-if-i-feel-the-pilot-is-guiding-the-flight-in-the-wrong-directio/25484#25484"">bad idea</a> and is probably just going to get you beaten up or worse. </p>

<p>Assuming this is a normal commercial flight then it will be as safe as any other until it lands and the passengers are off-loaded, otherwise it wouldn't be flying. If you're really worried about your destination I would choose to put on the vest after landing before leaving the airport but I can think of few places that this would be necessary that would also have normal flights still running to them. </p>

<p>Note, my advice might be different if your fear is based on a direct threat to you personally (i.e. because of who you are or what you do) rather than just a generically dangerous destination. But in that case you should probably be engaged with private security and asking them these questions. </p>

"Where and when is the best time to see the tulip fields in the Netherlands?","20926","","<p>I would like to see the tulip fields in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>Where and when is the best time to do it? (after the flower blooms and before the crop)

<p>The <a href=""https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keukenhof"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Keukenhof</a> is a park devoted to tulips and other flowers. It's itself located in this tulip growing area (the <em>Bollenstreek</em> or “bulb region”) so if you don't mind the entrance price, you could go there, see many tulips in the park itself but also in the fields around it. It's open for two months, corresponding approximately to the bloom season but there is often less to see at the very beginning and at the very end of the period so late April is probably the best time. There are buses going there during the season.</p>

<p>Do realize that most photographs deliberately make it all look bigger and more dramatic than it really is. As you can see on your aerial picture, many flower fields are relatively small and lie between buildings, roads and other cultures (or at least non-blooming flowers). The colors are altered too (see comment).</p>

"How old does a child need to be to sit separately from parents when flying?","20875","","<p>I just took a transatlantic Aer Lingus red eye flight with my 4 year old. When checking in the agent gave my child and I seats that were on opposite sides of the plane separated by about 5 rows. When I asked for adjacent seats she told me that the flight was sold out and I should have paid to reserve them in advance. After a little bit of grumbling, she reseated us next to each other. Are there any rules relating to this? Can I really seat a 4 year old next to innocent strangers and let them, and the flight attendants, deal with the resulting tantrum?</p>
","<p>There's no definitive answer to this and it will vary by country and airline.</p>

<p>This is what the UK Civil Aviation Authority says:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.caa.co.uk/default.aspx?catid=2207&amp;pageid=12706"">http://www.caa.co.uk/default.aspx?catid=2207&amp;pageid=12706</a></p>

<p>From a safety point of view children (it doesn't specify an age) SHOULD be seated CLOSE to their parent/guardian.  The reasons are many but if you imagine a decompression for example, where the oxygen masks deploy, you want someone to be able to fit the mask to the child.  Parents may not trust a random stranger to do this for their offspring.</p>

<p>If there was an emergency evacuation, you don't want parents having to move around the aircraft trying to get to their children to ensure they are evacuated etc.</p>

<p>Once the child gets to an age where they are responsible enough to look after themselves in the event of an emergency, then you can consider this to be reasonable.  This will vary depending on the child to some extent but perhaps age 12 would be reasonable.</p>

<p>Of course if you have 6 children as we do, you will invariably be separated by at least a row or an aisle, we always try to seat the youngest ones closest.  </p>

<p>In the past airlines (at least the ones I've flown with) would always try to seat families together but now that a lot of them charge for reserved seats they are less helpful in this regard.</p>

"Can Canadian money (change) be used in the United States?","20755","","<p>As a visitor to the US from Canada, is it possible to use Canadian money, especially coins, at businesses in the US?</p>

<p>What about vending machines?</p>
","<p>Technically no, practically speaking yes.</p>

<p>Many of the coins look the same as US coins at a first glance, so careless clerks may accept them. I am in the US and often find myself with Canadian pennies and quarters which are very similar to the US counterparts. Having all the new coins in the US in recent years makes it even harder for people to tell the difference. Generally, vending machines will not accept them.</p>

<p>It's probably technically illegal to pass them off as US currency though, it might be classifiable as counterfeiting or fraud, but it happens all the time, intentional or not.</p>

<p>EDIT: To summarize discussion in comments...</p>

<p>There may be stores near the border that officially accept CAD. That would be completely legitimate. I live in a border state but have never seen any. In all fairness I live 200 miles from the border but I do go near the border several times a year. I also have never specifically looked. It is probably limited to tourist locations.</p>

<p>In reference to careless clerks, using CAD for an entire transaction is unlikely to work. 4 CAD quarters would be way less likely to work than 3 USD and 1 CAD.</p>

<p>I'm still skeptical on the vending machine front. I've tried it without success and stopped trying, but maybe there are vending machines that would accept them. A whole discussion on how they work would probably be off-topic, but I think it has something to do with whether they detect a coin based on size or electrical resistance.</p>

<p>They note that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A stateless persons' document issued to an adult will usually be valid
  for 10 years if you have permission to stay in the United Kingdom
  permanently (known as 'indefinite leave to remain'). If you have

Obviously, they are going to need to have passports.  Their mother and I are separated, but not yet divorced, and she's, well, special.  I've offered to bring the ex along, but I suspect she will refuse. </p>

<p>The question is: Can I apply for a passport for the kids, without involving their mother?  Obviously, I intend on telling the mom before we leave the country, but I'm considering just going ahead and applying for the passports before she can come up with some, ahem, justification for why I shouldn't be able to get them their passports.  If nothing else, I'd like to be the one controlling the passports, because if anyone would flee the country with them, it would be her.</p>

<p>What does the law say about just one parent applying for the passports?  And, if I do get them, can she then apply for her own set of passports for the kids?</p>
","<p>There is an absolute requirement that either both parents are present when applying for the US passport or a <a href=""http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/passports/under-16.html#consent"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Consent is given by one of the parent's</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Minors under age 16 cannot apply for a passport by themselves.</p>
  
  <p>Both parents/guardians must appear in person with the minor and provide consent, authorizing passport issuance to the minor. If one parent/guardian is unable to appear in person, then the DS-11 application must be accompanied by a signed, notarized Form DS-3053: Statement of Consent from the non-applying parent/guardian.</p>
  
  <p>If the minor only has one parent/guardian, evidence of sole authority to apply for the minor must be submitted with the application in the form of a:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>U.S. or foreign birth certificate, Consular Report of Birth Abroad, or adoption decree, listing only the applying parent</li>
  <li>Court order granting sole legal custody to the applying parent (unless child’s travel is restricted by that order)</li>
  <li>Court order specifically permitting applying parent’s travel with the child</li>
  <li>Judicial declaration of incompetence of the non-applying parent</li>
  <li>Death certificate of the non-applying parent</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Technically their mother can apply for the passport as well but she will need the exact same form and will likely be denied since the birth certificate needs to be presented as well.</p>

<p>In addition to this in order for you to leave country a letter of consent from the other parent is required by the airline in order to allow one of the parent's to leave the country with the minor children.  This has been discussed here multiple times</p>

<p>Also, does this also apply to any public places, or just while moving around?</p>
","<p>Since the issue is not only with food that you can spill but also with drinking from bottles or cans (even if you buy it from a vending machine, you are not supposed to drink it while you walk), which are not as easy to spill as walking around with a ramen bowl, this is not a hygiene issue.</p>

<p>The topic is much more about the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette_in_Japan#Eating_and_drinking"">respect for food</a> at large. When Japanese people start eating, they put the hands together in a praying gesture and say ""Itadakimasu"", wich means ""I humbly receive"". People are also supposed to finish their food, even down to the last rice corn. There is another phrase to thank the cook once you are finished. Several other cultural details exist that underline this deep respect for food.</p>

<p>When you are eating while walking, you are taking food too casually, and forget to pay respect to the people who grew/made it and the souls of the organisms who perished in the process. You are supposed to cherish your food, which is taken to comical extremes in the ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WrkdTrrwew"">Ramen Scene</a>"" of the movie ""<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092048/"">Tampopo</a>"", which is a comedy only about food in Japan. </p>

<p>There are a lot of restaurants that serve food on the street, but you are supposed to eat it right there, on the spot, often under a canopy or umbrella, instead of walking away with it. Probably the only exception is ice cream. It is very possible that it is exempt because of western influence.</p>

<p>My specifics: we're taking a family vacation to Myrtle Beach, SC from Stafford, Virginia. My son has a Virginia Learner's Permit. Will he be able (legally allowed) to drive my car in SC?</p>
","<p>Here is a <a href=""http://bghs.d214.org/academics/state_to_state_reciprocity.aspx"">link</a> that discusses the requirements state by state. North Carolina will allow the use of an out of state learner's permit in most cases, South Carolina will not.</p>

<p>One issue is that different states have different restrictions. For instance, some states, including Virginia, will allow learners' permits for age 15; most states require age 16, and those states (e.g. North Carolina) won't honor a 15 year old's learners permit if that's the case for your son; he has to be 16. To one of the comments above, New York State will honor learner's permits only for people over the age of 18. People aged 16-17 from other states are not allowed to drive in certain parts of New York state even with a license, and in other parts of the state only with severe restrictions.</p>

<p>Also, states have different minimum age requirements for the (licensed) driver in the passenger's seat, typically 20 or 21. Finally, different states have rules/restrictions on class of cars, vehicles etc.</p>

"Where to find free printable road maps/atlases online?","20569","","<p>Where can I find free printable road maps online? I sometimes go on trips which require driving from town to town - before the internet, I'd have had to buy a basic road atlas for this. Now I can simply print out driving instructions from Google Maps. Nonetheless, it'd be helpful to have a map of at least the major roads in the area I'm heading in case I go off route, and to make sense of the instructions and roadside signs. Where can I find this? Free would be preferable.</p>

<p>I've taken to printing off Google Maps, but this is a pain - it's hard to get the right area in Google's print dialogue, and I tend to have to zoom out so much the road names cease to appear. I end up taking screenshots of different sections of the area and printing them out on separate pages but this is hardly elegant.</p>

<p>(I've tried Open Street Map but didn't find it any better than Google Maps - though I'm not that familiar with it.)</p>
","<p>I use <a href=""http://www.viamichelin.de/"" rel=""nofollow"">ViaMichelin</a> to plan my itineraries. The website is a bit more clumsy than Google Maps, but the itineraries and ancillary information are of a better quality. In ViaMichelin you also get maps. An overview maps of the whole trip as well as detailed maps for the different steps. These are the same maps as the Michelin maps you would buy on paper. Compared to Google, it is easier to zoom in and to print a given area. </p>

<p>The more difficult part is related to printing. It is hard to fit a whole trip on an A4 page. Even for a smaller trip, such as e.g. Brussels - Frankfurt/Main (+- 400km) it is hard to obtain a map that is still useable and readable. Moreover, if you take into consideration the price of colour ink or toner, apparently free maps come at a cost. </p>

<p>When it comes to long distance travel, my personal conclusion is that there are no (free) online resources, which might be able to compete with traditional maps and atlases. If you do not want to spend too much money on maps and atlases, you can do the following. There  are road atlases covering Europe or parts of it. These are updated every year. When the updates are available or about to come out, the ""older"" ones are sold with huge discounts. These atlases are not ""dernier cri"" anymore, but remain very accurate and reliable. But, before a trip, you can always cross-check with ViaMichelin or alike. </p>

<p>Things are different if you are interested in local information. You can have destinaiton specific resources such as <a href=""http://getamap.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/getamap/frames.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">Get-a-map</a> in the United Kingdom. As suggested in the comments, you might also be able to find free online maps made available by local tourist offices. </p>

"How to safely transport external hard drives during air travel?","20478","","<p>I plan to take a few external hard drives from Boston to Paris (air travel). How can I safely transport them? Beyond backing them up, bubble wrapping them and taking them as in cabin-luggage, what else can I do to reduce the likelihood of damage? I am mostly afraid of screening machines and in-flight vibrations.</p>
","<p>External drives (or internal ones - same drive, different case) will have zero problems with commercial air travel. X-rays don't affect them, and any in-flight vibrations capable of damaging a disk drive will also destroy the airplane.</p>

<p>Now that's assuming it's turned off. Running drives don't like to be knocked around, but that applies on your desk too. As Ital mentioned altitude is a factor for spinning drives, but the altitude limits are well above standard cabin pressure. If the yellow masks pop out of the ceiling it's time to put your computer away anyway, as you will be landing very soon.</p>

<p>So unless you drop it down the stairs, or it falls off the baggage cart and gets run over by an aircraft tug, it will be fine.</p>

"Can solo travelers go to a mixed gender onsen?","20451","","<p>I'm planning on going to a mixed gender onsen (konyoku), and one place suggested to me in Nyuto onsen village, Tohoku, has a male only section, a female only section, and a mixed section. If I'm by myself (as opposed to being part of a mixed sex group), am I going to raise eyebrows if I choose the mixed section?</p>

<p>One ojiisan (old man) told me that obaasan (old women) are the only women who bathe without a towel in mixed onsen nowadays. Maybe that means I wouldn't be accused of having bad motives in choosing a mixed onsen, unless a fetish for old women exists in Japan.</p>

<p>Also, I've heard that mixed onsen are becoming increasingly rare in Japan, mainly confined to conservative rural areas (perhaps non-tourist oriented onsen?). Why is this happening? Are western influences to blame? (I asked the ojiisan about it, and he didn't know either)</p>
","<p>Mixed gender onsen are indeed increasingly rare, and younger ladies frequenting them tend to wear swimsuits these days.  Most of the remaining ones I know of are public, free and have no staff on site.  They're also very basic, with usually just a single bath, so they're mixed more by necessity than choice -- there isn't really any alternative!</p>

<p>Nyuto (or, rather, Tsurunoyu, which is by far the biggest and best known bathhouse there) is a bit of an exception in being a big ""commercial"" onsen and having mixed-gender pools.  A big part of which is that it's also unusual in another respect: the water is milky white (hence the name: 乳頭 means ""nipple""!), so you can't actually see anything below the neck anyway.  So, no, nobody will think you're weird if you go to the mixed section; a female friend of mine who frequents rural onsen reserves that term for the guys who sit outside the pool facing in with their legs spread, family jewels on display.  (Hint: use the little towel you get to preserve a shred of dignity when out and about.)</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gkLqJ.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>As for why, blaming ""Western influences"" is a bit too facile.  Traditionally, Japanese didn't have baths at home, they went out to public, shared sento bathhouses, which were not segregated, or had token segregation at best (eg. a rope across the tub dividing it in two).  These days everybody has bathtubs at home and sentos are an endangered species, so hanging around naked with members of the opposite sex is no longer common.</p>

","<p>One option you have is to find a shopping mall or a supermarket that offers a photo booth.

"How to prepare for very long train journeys?","20441","","<p>A friend of mine is going to take a very long train journey the next week. The journey takes 44 hours according to the train schedule and takes place in Europe. He has to change trains two times. Once after 12 hours, and the second time after 20 hours. There is not a lot of time between these trains on the stations. The journey starts early in the morning and lasts until early afternoon two days later.</p>

<p>He is a little bit afraid of this very long journey and therefore looking for tips how to prepare. For example how to get some sleep in a normal train compartment, how to fight the boredom, what do eat, etc.</p>
","<ul>
<li><p>Take your own food. As a rule, the food served on trains is bland and overpriced. He will probably have time at the stations to purchase extra drinks, or if not get them on the train. </p></li>
<li><p>He is probably not going to sleep that well in a regular train compartment (I never do at least). Obviously he should take a book. The main risk if he is travelling alone is that he will have an aisle seat and will have to try not to accidentally lean on the person in the window when he falls asleep.</p></li>
<li><p>Have the details of the changes written down and near to hand. Don't look at the tickets themselves whilst on a train station platform - the risk of accidentally losing them in the rush is too high. Instead write down all the info (including your seat number) on a seperate piece of paper that you can just shove in your pocket and keep your tickets safe in your bag. </p></li>
<li><p>Always try to get the window seat! </p></li>
<li><p>Find out what the words for ""departure"", ""arrival"" and ""platform"" are in the countries that you will be changing in. It is usually in English too, but knowing the German (or whatever) won't hurt.</p></li>
<li><p>Like mindcorrosive said, you have to watch out for things being stolen whilst you're sleeping. Personally I always have a seperate, small backpack (that I carry on my front if I have two backpacks), with all my valuables in and a padlock on it. I use it as a pillow, so it would be pretty hard for anyone to take it without me noticing, plus I get a free pillow :) </p></li>
<li><p>If he is taking a night train he should have booked a sleeping compartment! I know it seems expensive, but trust me, after one trip like this he will really understand why it's good value for money. You may not sleep that much better in a bunk, but at least you have space to put your feet and a personal reading light. I know the difference in price makes  you think twice, and I've been persuaded by the cheaper ticket many times, but every time I cave and buy the cheaper seating ticket I end up regretting it. Obviously it's too late to change this, but for anyone else who reads this I can't recommend it enough. </p>

<p>I've taken 100+ night trains in Europe and maybe 25% of them were miserable experiences because I had to sit in a six person compartment (3 people facing 3 people), in a middle seat, in the carriage next to the engine, with 5 people who didn't speak English and refused to turn the light off, with nowhere to put my feet and nowhere to rest my head for 12+ hours overnight. </p></li>

<p>I don't want to get to great details, but there is a longer history of my electronic I-94 being wrong that have required visits in deferred inspection center. As the situation has got somewhat complicated, I'd prefer to have the stamp if possible as that's the primary form of evidence, without relying on electronic I-94 getting updated correctly.</p>

<p>Is it possible to get a real stamp and how?</p>
","<p>It's impossible, at least given the setup of the vast majority of (if not all) US airports.</p>

<p>In these airports, because there is no exit control, it is possible to leave the departure lounge, without boarding your flight, and also without passing through the immigration hall.  For example, if you check in to your flight, and, while you're waiting to board, you receive news of some emergency that prevents you from flying, you can just walk out past the security checkpoint and onto the street.</p>

<p>For a CBP officer to be certain that you've actually left the country, he would have to be certain either that you are on the plane when the doors close or that you are in the international zone of the airport.  This area is normally accessible only to <em>arriving</em> passengers, so you would also require special handling by the airline staff in order to get on the plane.  And, once you're past the special door and, by whatever route, in the plane or on the jetway, it is again possible for you to walk back up the jetway and into the departure lounge.</p>

<p>The CBP officer would therefore have to rely on the airline staff to assure him that you were in fact on the plane when its door closed.  And, come to think of it, that's exactly what the I-94 system is supposed to achieve.</p>

<p>Granted, the I-94 system is quite imperfect.  My wife has several entries in the database that do not have a corresponding exit.</p>

<p>To change between terminals airside at Heathrow, you need to go through Flight Connections.

<p>Alternately, if you're allowed to enter the UK, you could enter the UK in T5, take the free train connection to T1/T2/T3 and walk the couple of minutes from there to T3. However, you'd then be stuck, as they would want to see a boarding pass before letting you into the security queue, and you won't have a T3 boarding pass, only a T5 one, so they won't let you in.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>There is a workaround though if you want to do a (significant) amount of shopping. As described in <a href=""http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/british-airways-executive-club/1186221-duty-free-shopping-transfer-terminals.html"">this FlyerTalk thread</a> at the end, Heathrow provides a <a href=""http://www.worlddutyfree.com/customer-services/personal-shopper.html"">Personal Shopper service</a>. If you contact them in advance about it, they can apparently arrange for the item to be brought to another terminal so you can look at it and purchase. Apparently, if you have a lot of time, and it's quiet, they might be able to arrange a transfer, but that part isn't guaranteed.</p>

<p>That looks to be your only way. Well, other than booking a fully refundable (check the T&amp;C closely!) ticket out of T3, follow flight connections to T3 for that, shop, go online and cancel the ticket, ask customer services in T3 to ""land"" you, follow flight connections back to T5 on your onward boarding pass, then collapse in a heap on your return...!</p>

"Extended stay visa for Germany","20082","","<p>I want to apply for an extended stay visa for Germany to visit a friend.  I want to visit beyond the 90 days that American can visit Schengen countries without going through an application process.  The German embassy website indicates that I need to fill out an on-line visa application form.  The form asks for the length of stay but indicates that a number greater than 90 days can't be entered.  I'm also asked to provide a copy of a plane reservation but I don't want to buy a plane ticket without knowing if I can stay longer than 90 days.  </p>

<p>Does anyone have pointers for navigating the process?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>  After some digging around I found from the <a href=""http://www.germany.info/Vertretung/usa/en/05__Legal/02__Directory__Services/01__Visa/__Permanent__Residence__Visa.html"">German Embassy Website</a> that anyone who wishes to stay in Germany more than 90 days must obtain a residence permit.  This information was hard to find because it is only stated in the section that deals with permanent residence.  From the website:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Citizens of the United States of America, Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, Switzerland, the Republic of Korea, as well as EU citizens may apply for their residence permit after entering Germany without a visa.</p>
</blockquote>
","<p>I think you may be looking at the wrong form.</p>

<p>As I understand it, as a US passport holder, you're allowed to spend up to 90 days in any 6 month period in the Schengen area without needing a visa. See <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/484/visa-for-european-countries-when-traveling-from-the-u-s"">Visa for European countries for US passport holder</a></p>

<p>To go beyond that, you generally need a long stay visa (typically in the form of a residents permit) for one country in the Schengen area. Once in possession of that, you're allowed to stay in that one country for as long as you want / your visa allows. Visits to other Schengen countries are normally covered by your US passport visa waiver, so you're limited to 90 days in any 6 months in the remainder of the Schengen area.</p>

<p>Depending on the Schengen country you're heading to, as a US passport holder you may need to apply for the long stay visa / residence visa / residency permit before you leave, or on arrival. </p>

<p>For Germany, it looks like you normally do it when you're there on your 90 days. It's actually a two step process, first you need to go to the local Einwohnermeldeamt with your passport and proof of German address, to get a Meldeschein or a Anmeldebestätigung. Then you can go to the Landratsamt with this and various other paperwork, and get a Aufenthaltserlaubnis (residence visa). See <a href=""http://www.journey-to-germany.com/residence-visa.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this site</a> for a really good walkthrough of the process.</p>

<p>That said, the German Embassy in America do say on their website that Americans can apply for a Permanent Residence Visa before getting to Germany if they wish. <a href=""http://www.germany.info/Vertretung/usa/en/05__Legal/02__Directory__Services/01__Visa/__Permanent__Residence__Visa.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This page</a> explains the process and required documentation, as well as the application form and fees.

"Cost for US cell phone users to receive international calls","20024","","<p>This is a question not from the point of view of the traveler, but from the point of view of someone in the US receiving calls from a traveler abroad.</p>

<p>In general, for the major US wireless carriers, is there any charge (other than normal minutes) to receive international calls? In other words, are they charged just like any domestic incoming call, or are there higher prices because the call is international?</p>
","<p>In the U.S., traditionally all calls are charged only to the initiator of the call.  This applies to local, domestic long-distance, and international long-distance calls.  The exceptions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Collect calls, naturally, the receiver pays these calls (if they accept the collect call)</li>
<li><p>Traditional mobile phone plans charge a flat per-minute rate for ""air time.""  This same rate applies whether the call is being received or initiated by the mobile phone, and whether the call is local, domestic long-distance, or international-long distance.  Any charges for initiating a call are added to this.</p>

<p>The main problem is walking around with the 2 bags. I've done mostly ""1 front, 1 back"" but it becomes uncomfortable very quickly, and very hot too.</p>

<p>Edit: I travel with a DSLR camera, so that's the main reason for the lighter backpack. I want to keep it accessible, and keep it with me when visiting a place (with the big backpack left at the hostel) so that's why I don't put it in the main/big backpack.</p>

<p>My second bag is a <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0052E8Z5Q"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Think Tank Speed Demon 2.0</a>, and it holds my camera, lenses, etc, and when I'm traveling, a water bottle, perhaps spare change, maps, etc. Anything I might want quickly. </p>

<p>The Think Tank bag is marketed specifically as a camera bag, and I use it for that, even when I'm not traveling.  It's ideal for travel photography, because it wraps around my waist, so my camera (and extra lenses, external flash, or whatever other accessories) are always easily accessible--even when I'm wearing my travel pack on my back! Ken Rockwell first turned me on to the Speed Demon 2.0 pack with his <a href=""http://kenrockwell.com/tech/think-tank-speed-demon.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">review</a>. (While I disagree with a large portion of what Ken Rockwell says, his reviews on <em>usability</em> are often valuable, IMHO).</p>

<p>I spent a month backpacking around Mexico with this setup, including several long days carrying both bags with me all day long. (Of course, when possible, I'd leave as much stuff as I could in a hotel room, but that's not always possible.)</p>

<p>For my next backpacking trip, I intend to add a third back-mounted daypack, that I will stuff inside my travel pack.  I'll keep my laptop, swim suit, and other smaller items in there, when it's possible to leave the bulk of my belongings in a hotel room, but my waist pack isn't big enough.</p>

<p>If you don't carry many camera lenses, a similar waist/fanny pack would probably work well for you, and it doesn't reduce mobility or cause you to overheat as a front-worn backpack would.  If you do use many camera lenses, I still suggest this setup, but perhaps with a larger fanny pack than the one I use.</p>

"What are mini-bar policies for one-night stays in hotels?","19892","","<p>I've had this question on my mind for a while now because I've never understood how this works. I began traveling two years ago for personal reasons and sometimes I've stayed in various hotels for the night. Some of those hotels had mini-bar service in the room but I've never taken anything from them since all the products inside them are overpriced compared to the nearest supermarket and for this reason I've always bought what I needed from the supermarket to save money.<br>
But after a few stays I started to think: ""How could the hotel know if one customer took something from the mini-bar during the night if he was checking out the day after he checked in? And he checks out even before the room is cleaned and/or someone goes to check the mini-bar""?</p>

<p>I thought that the hotel would check the mini-bar after the customer checks out and then charge all the products to his credit card registered during the check-in. But what if the customer used a prepaid card?</p>

<p>Can you please explain to me what the mini-bar policy is for a one-night stay in a hotel?</p>
","<p>There are a few things you have to consider. I worked before at a hotel refilling those minibars. So I know a bit of how it works. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Some hotels have an electronic system. This system registers if something has been taken from the minibar. Please note them some people replace a can of coke (or take it out and after putting it back) and the system will see that as ""consumption"" because of the technical limitation. In those cases they will check the minimbar to confirm. </p></li>
<li><p>Some hotel force you to wait a few minutes. So they check if you used any paid items. </p></li>
<li><p>After charge with Credit Card. Hotels can after charge once they discover something is missing. Only for CC customers. </p></li>
<li><p>You might be lucky they discover it too late. Some will just ask and believe customers are honest. However they might charge you if you would enter your next stay there.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Always note that some hotels work with blacklists. Once you are listed and hotels use the list, they will reject you. Many hotels might even share these with other hotels to protect the entire business . I would always recommend paying these services if you are planning to use them. Or else just find a convenience store in the area. </p>

<ul>

","<p>Answering your second question first, if you are travelling A-B-C and want to retrieve you bag at B, you would ask to short-check your bag to B. Airlines have varying policies around this and whether they will allow you to do so. This may depend on the connection time at B, whether you have an overnight stay, or whether you're on a fully flexible ticket. Check-in staff may be able to make an exception to their policy if you give them a convincing enough reason, such as you have medicines or medical equipment that needs retrieving at B, or you are delivering something to someone at B. The reasons they have policies against short-checking have been explained <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/14807/checking-in-bags-to-different-destinations-when-flying-with-a-layover/14813#14813"">elsewhere</a> and are for things such as discouraging hidden-city ticketing.</p>

<p>If you arrive at B with bags checked to C and you don't board your connecting flight, the rules depend upon the country you're currently in at B and whether B-C is an international flight. As Doc mentions in comments, <a href=""http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/opre.49.2.181.13529"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Positive Passenger Bag Matching</a> rules apply to certain flights.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Positive passenger bag-match (PPBM) is a security measure aimed at
  preventing baggage unaccompanied by passengers from traveling in
  aircraft luggage compartments. Such matching is now performed on
  virtually all international flights</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On domestic flights in the USA this is only one option that currently <a href=""https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/49/44901"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">may be selected</a> if explosive detection systems are not in place.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(e)Mandatory Screening Where EDS Not Yet Available.—As soon as
  practicable but not later than the 60th day following the date of
  enactment of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act and until
  the requirements of subsection (b)(1)(A) are met, the Under Secretary
  shall require alternative means for screening any piece of checked
  baggage that is not screened by an explosives detection system. Such
  alternative means <strong>may include 1 or more of the following</strong>:  </p>
  
  <p>(1) A
  bag-match program that ensures that no checked baggage is placed
  aboard an aircraft unless the passenger who checked the baggage is
  aboard the aircraft.<br>
  (2) Manual search.<br>
  (3) Search by canine
  explosives detection units in combination with other means.<br>
  (4)
  Other means or technology approved by the Under Secretary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If PPBM rules apply, the airline has no option but to unload your bag if you choose not to fly or do not board. If you inform them as soon as possible, this will allow the airline to remove your luggage without causing a departure delay, which failure to turn up at boarding time almost inevitably would. Theoretically you could inform the airline at A that you have no intention to board at B and that they would inevitably have to unload your luggage anyway, but that would create the risk that they would refuse to let you fly without repricing the new itinerary, or charging for short-check, e.g. on <a href=""http://v-flyer.com/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=289482"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Virgin</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our bags could be checked to LHR only for a fee of $215 per pax! Half
  an hour later and $430 lighter, our bags are checked only to LHR.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Others on that thread have managed to get their bags short-checked without fee.</p>

<p>An alternative to requesting short-check is to find an itinerary that requires you to retrieve luggage during transfer. One common method is to require a change of airport, such as LHR-LGW, LHR-LCY, JFK-LGA, CDG-ORY which is an option if the transfer city has multiple airports. Another option is to force an overnight stay. e.g. from <a href=""http://www.klm.com/travel/nl_en/prepare_for_travel/baggage/baggage_allowance/index.htm#p6"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">KLM's policy</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When transferring, you only need to collect your baggage and check it
  in again for your connecting flight, if:<br>
  ...<br>
  -  You arrive at one airport and your connecting flight departs from another airport<br>
  -  Your transfer lasts longer than 12 hours or your next flight departs the next day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the airline refuses to allow short-check and you arrive at B, you would inform the airline staff that you are not flying B-C and request that they retrieve your luggage. This is not at all an unlikely event as people fall sick during journeys, get lost, distracted or delayed during connections, and may need to change travel plans for other unexpected reasons. Obviously, airlines must have procedures for removing luggage in certain circumstances. Assuming the airline agrees to retrieve your luggage, there may be a considerable delay in returning it to you, and it may get lost or redirected during the process. The bag tag will still have final destination on it and there is a risk that other processes in the system result in the bag not making it to the luggage belt. Some airlines reportedly <a href=""http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/klm-flying-dutchman/1451281-offload-baggage-fee.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">charge to retrieve your bag</a> in this situation:</p>

<blockquote>

  now it was too late to go with the bags to London, so other than
  abandoning the luggage I had no choice but pay 550 euros , to get my
  luggage.</p>

<p>And <a href=""http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/23655981-post1.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Air France</a> (closely related to KLM):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Air France says the only other way to get my bags at CDG is to pay a
  €275 fee once there, as there's a policy for check-in agents NOT to
  honor requests to tag bags with the connecting airport.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://www.airfrance.nl/NL/en/common/transverse/footer/edito_cgt1_airfrance.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Air France general conditions of carriage</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the Passenger does not use all their Flight Coupons and prematurely
  interrupts their journey, the Passenger may be required to pay a fixed
  amount, specified by the Carrier when the Reservation was made, in
  order to be able to retrieve their Checked Baggage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given a lack of itinerary and airlines in your question, that is all that really could be said. Each airline has different policies and procedures that may also depend on the itinerary and transfers, and you would need to request short-check at check-in and negotiate/escalate. In general, it would be best to check the airlines's conditions of carriage for any specified fees, e.g. for <a href=""http://www.britishairways.com/en-gb/information/legal/british-airways/general-conditions-of-carriage"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">British Airways</a></p>

  price applicable to your revised transportation will result in refusal
  of carriage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Providing you are skipping the final segment, failure to pay any additional fee for the journey as flown only results in the refusal of carriage. There is no mention of any charge to retrieve luggage.</p>

<p>Similarly, I see no mention of a fee in American Airlines or Alitalia CoCs.</p>

The only difference in Germany is that there is no culture of offering free tap water everywhere.</p>

<p>Thus asking for tap water in a German restaurant (and expecting to pay less than for bottled water) is like insisting on only paying the wholesale price for any other beverage.
On the other hand, if you are willing to pay as much for tap water as you would pay for bottled water, you are at worst considered eccentric.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So I wonder if it is rude to buy it somewhere like a convenience store or supermarket in advance and bring it to a restaurant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most restaurants¹ have a house rule that explicitly forbids you to consume food or beverages that you brought.²
In cheaper establishments, you may find big signs telling you about this; elsewhere it is small print.</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>¹ And any other place that sells you food and provides a place for you to consume it.<br>
² The main exceptions to this are many <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_garden"" rel=""noreferrer"">beer gardens</a>, most canteens, and restaurants that won’t serve alcohol for religious reasons but allow you to bring your own for a fee.<br>
</sup></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Or is there anything others you can drink in cheaper price while eating?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are with a group, it’s fully acceptable to order a huge bottle of water with a few glasses and share the price.</p>

<p>Except for this, the answer is that you are expected not to go to restaurants if you want to save money.
Of course, I am aware that this may not be possible for you, e.g., if you are with a group, but this is the general attitude towards this:
Going to a restaurant is considered a (small) luxury; if you want to eat and drink cheap, you are expected to go to a supermarket, fast-food vendor, or similar.
Note that while for fast-food restaurants and similar, the aforementioned rule usually still applies, you can almost always take the food and consume it elsewhere with your own water.³</p>

<p>Note that the waiting staff in Germany doesn’t rely on tips for their living.
Therefore a less rude way to save money is to omit the tip, in particular if you provide an excuse for it (or it is obvious that you were dragged along with a larger group, who tips well).</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>³ The best way to do this in turn is to have one or two bottles that you re-fill with tap water at every opportunity, such as in your residence.</sup></p>

But is there any possible way to drive a car to Hawaii?</p>

<p>Let's say you were attempting to drive to all 50 states in the U.S., is there a not too difficult way to get that same vehicle over to Hawaii?</p>
","<p>According to <a href=""http://wikitravel.org/en/Hawaii#By_car"">Wikitravel</a>, unless your car is amphibious (like the Aquada), you'll need to get it freighted to Hawaii.</p>

<p>According to them it usually takes three to four weeks, you will need a variety of paperwork and (of course) shipping insurance.  But it's certainly possible.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as per the same Wikitravel link, the days when everyone arrived by boat are gone. The only way you can get there yourself by boat is by cruise ship from the western coast of North America, for example, and I'm not sure if any companies allow you to bring your own car, let along drive it onto the boat...</p>

"What are the signs of a bed bug infestation?","19804","","<p>Bed bugs have become a real problem recently, with more and more places reporting outbreaks.  What can you do to avoid being exposed to these nasty parasites?</p>

<p>If you do get exposed, what can you do to get rid of them (preferably before you bring them home!)?</p>
","<p>Well I'm a bit of a sub-expert on this, having worked nine years in the hostelling industry and encountering them as a traveller once in India.</p>

<p>There's a bit of a dirty little secret in the hospitality industry about just how bad the bed bug problem has been for the past few years. Apparently all the big/expensive hotel chains have been having problems - it's not just dirty dives with holes in the wall that are affected.</p>

<p><strong>What are the signs of a bed bug infestation?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Bed bugs hide in furniture, cracks, under carpets, inside power sockets, etc. They love wooden furniture.</li>
<li>Bed bugs only come out late at night. In my experience around 3am / 4am is prime time for them.</li>
<li>They like to bite then move along a bit, bite again, move along a bit, etc. You will have little straight lines of small bites.</li>
<li>Their bites don't seem to hurt and do not itch, but they do bleed a little. You will have little spots of blood on your sheets, pillow, pyjamas, etc.</li>
<li>They look a bit like baby cockroaches. They can range in size from a tiny spot to about the size of the nail of your little finger. You can surprise them by turning the lights on suddenly and looking through the sheets and under the pillow. They don't move fast but seem to be able to hide pretty quickly.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What to do if you find bed bugs?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Bed bugs do not carry disease. They're yucky and I hate them, but you can't catch anything from them.</li>
<li><strong>Infestations</strong> of bed bugs are very hard to get rid of! This is because the eggs are harder to kill than the hatched bugs. It takes at least one or two weeks. We always call in professional exterminators.</li>
<li><strong>Individual</strong> bed bugs are easy to kill! Too hot or too cold will kill them. Wash <strong>all</strong> your clothes in <strong>hot</strong> water! <strong>Everything</strong> else of your luggage I recommend wrapping and sealing in tough black plastic bin liners and leaving in direct sun for at least a day or two.</li>
<li>If you have an overseas flight, the low temperatures in the luggage hold will kill them! I don't know the details on how high and how many hours are necessary though. We're pretty sure we get ours from travellers arriving in Australia from Thailand.</li>
<li>Bed bugs spread <strong>very easily</strong>! Tell your accommodation that they have them. It's up to them how to deal with them but if they are responsible the sooner they know they have a problem the better. If you move your stuff to another room or another hotel or hostel without the hot wash and black bagging I've mentioned you will probably spread them. Especially don't move to stay at a friend's place without taking those precautions!</li>
</ul>

"Baggage locker in downtown San Francisco","19803","","<p>I'm staying at a hotel very close to the <em>San Francisco International Airport</em> on <em>S Airport Blvd, South San Francisco</em>.  </p>

<p>I need to check out from the hotel Saturday morning and I have a flight back to Europe from the <em>Oakland International Airport</em>, same day in the evening.  </p>

<p>I'm trying to maximize my time of visiting downtown San Francisco (the tourist stuff), therefore I'm thinking to take my luggage (something <a href=""https://images3.campingworld.com/CampingWorld/images/products/8000/1000x1000/84588n-luggage.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">like this</a>) downtown, after I check out from the hotel in the morning, leave it in some baggage locker, do my sightseeing, then around 16:00-17:00 take it and head to the <em>Oakland International Airport</em>. </p>

<p>Any reliable suggestions for a baggage locker downtown San Francisco? (please mention the price too, if known)  </p>

<p>I found <a href=""http://www.pier39.com/home/shop/services/california-welcome-center/"" rel=""nofollow"">this one</a> so far and they mention they do have baggage storage. Did anyone try it without problems?</p>
","<p>The Pier 39 California Welcome Center (as mentioned in <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/67016/is-there-somewhere-i-can-store-luggage-one-or-two-normal-suitcases-in-san-fran"">this question</a>) does offer luggage storage. It's <a href=""http://www.pier39.com/home/pier-info/frequently-asked-questions/#luggage"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">$5/bag</a>, 7am-9pm. I've never used the service, but it's run by the state's tourism promotion organization and I would expect it to be reasonably reliable. The catch is the location: it's Pier 39, which is an extremely touristy area, and it's not directly connected to the main public transit (BART) train that you might use to get to the Oakland airport. As such, you will spend a chunk of your day in SF traveling to/from Pier 39 instead of seeing the city. If you plan to get to the airport by taxi (which could easily cost more than $60+tip depending on traffic), this is less of a problem. </p>

<p>A more central location to store your luggage would be the Union Square/Powell area, which is easily reachable by BART both from SFO and on your way to the Oakland airport. There are many hotels in this area, and while some will frown on storing luggage for non-guests, you may find an accommodating bellhop, especially if you're prepared to offer a tip. Saying you'll get a drink or bite to eat at the hotel restaurant could help. If they refuse, you could try another hotel. A few years ago, the Chancellor Hotel, just off Union Square, <a href=""https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60713-i30-k6387988-Where_can_luggage_be_left_for_the_day_in_San_Francisco-San_Francisco_California.html#48766550"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">was offering to store luggage</a> for just a tip (thanks to <a href=""https://ask.metafilter.com/239865/Where-to-store-luggage-near-the-Farmers-Market-in-San-Francisco#3478633"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">vacapinta on MetaFilter</a> for this recommendation). </p>

<p>Another option might be the Temporary Transbay Terminal. The Amtrak office offers <a href=""https://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=am/am2Station/Station_Page&amp;code=SFC"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">luggage storage</a>, though I'm not sure of the fee. This is a few blocks walk from the Embarcadero BART station and the Ferry Building. </p>

<p>Finally, you might try a museum coat check, particularly if your bags are on the smaller size and you plan to visit the museum anyway. SFMOMA (SF Museum of Modern Art) is near the Powell BART station and <a href=""https://www.sfmoma.org/visit/visitor-guidelines/#section-coat-check"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">their website</a> doesn't say anything about refusing luggage, just large instruments, animals, and bikes. It is, however, newly reopened after expansion and advance tickets are required to enter. The coat check downstairs might technically be accessible without a ticket though. The Asian Art Museum, near Civic Center BART, says they <a href=""http://www.asianart.org/visit/plan-your-visit"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">take</a> purses, bags, and large parcels. The Exploratorium (interactive science museum) has coin-operated lockers inside the ticketed area. Some in my experience are large enough to accommodate at least a carry-on sized bag. </p>

"Can I pre-purchase more luggage allowance on Qatar Airways flights?","19762","","<p>Can I pre-purchase more luggage allowance on Qatar Airways flights?</p>

<p>I am traveling with Qatar Airways from Stockholm, Sweden (<code>ARN</code>) to Bangkok, Thailand (<code>BKK</code>) and I will be carrying one additional bag beyond the carry-on and standard check-in bag. </p>

<p>Am I able to pre-purchase allowance for this additional bag or is it always counted as excess luggage according to the fee list on their website?</p>

<p>And if so are there different rules for different routes (i.e transatlantic fares or such)?</p>
","<p>So apparently Qatar Airways has multiple baggage <a href=""http://www.qatarairways.com/global/en/baggage.page"" rel=""nofollow"">rules</a>. Some routes (to/from US, Canada, Brazil, Argentina) have rules based both on number of pieces and weight, as most other airlines (as far as I know).</p>

<p>In your case (travel between Europe and Asia via Doha), the baggage allowance is only based on the weight you carry. You are allowed 23 kg as checked-in bags, and as carry-on, <a href=""http://www.qatarairways.com/global/en/baggage.page"" rel=""nofollow""><code>One piece, not to exceed 7 kg and 50 x 37 x 25 cm</code></a>. There are still usual rules for the maximum weight of a piece of luggage: 32 kg.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> : as @JoErNanO commented, the rules changed (and price increased) for purchasing extra luggage allowance. The new rules follow.</p>

<p>To answer your first question, yes you can pre-purchase baggage allowance online, and <a href=""http://www.qatarairways.com/qa/en/excess-baggage-rates.page"" rel=""nofollow"">it is cheaper than at the airport</a>. You can purchase this extra allowance from the time you made the booking until 72 hours before the flight departure. 
The prices depend on origin and destination, for travels from Europe to Far East areas, the price is 40USD per kg if you book online.</p>

<p>You can also pre-purchase baggage allowance at Qatar Airways offices (in cities, airports, or via phone) but it will be the same price as when you check in (more expensive than online, by 5-15USD/kg). For travels from Europe to Far East areas, the price is 50USD per kg.</p>

<p>Note that for transatlantic flights (to/from Argentina, Brazil, Canada and the USA), the pricing is different. One extra piece of luggage will be billed 200USD per piece online or 250USD per piece in an office or at the check-in. The price is different if the piece of luggage weighs too much : 50/65USD per kg (online/office prices).</p>

<p>For those traveling to Africa, <a href=""http://www.qatarairways.com/qa/en/excess-baggage-bulk-rates.page"" rel=""nofollow"">there are bulk prices</a>. If you travel with more than 5kg extra, you pay a cheaper price (around 10USD per kg). This purchase can only be done in Qatar Airways city offices, though, at least 24 hours before flight departure.</p>

<p>Note: 1 kg is 2.2 lbs.</p>

<hr>

<p>To summarize, you can book online extra weight allowance and <a href=""http://www.qatarairways.com/qa/en/excess-baggage-rates.page"" rel=""nofollow"">you will pay 40 USD per extra kg</a> of baggage if you pre-purchase online at least 72 hours before your flight departure.

Is there a way to just renew it, or do you have to go through the complete application process again?</p>

<p>Also, do you need to wait for it to expire before applying?</p>
","<p>There's a <a href=""https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/1197/~/esta--general-esta-renewal"">convenient page on the ESTA program website</a>:</p>

<p><strong>When my ESTA expires how do I renew my application?</strong></p>

<p>If your ESTA has expired, you must reapply for a brand new authorization by submitting a new application. Current authorizations can not be extended. Go to <a href=""https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta/esta.html?_flowExecutionKey=_c7BA5F6F2-1123-7A2C-39E5-30D0FEBEAF79_k1B868357-20A1-8CD2-D15E-261762554D64"">ESTA.cbp.gov</a>, follow the instructions to answer all of the required questions and submit a new application for travel authorization - just like you did the first time you applied.</p>

<p>You do not need to wait until your ESTA expires to re-apply.  You may do so at any time before, on or after the expiration date of your existing ESTA.  Should you receive the message ""A valid, approved application with more than 30 days remaining has been found for this passport. Submitting this application will require payment for this application and will then cancel the existing application."" you will simply continue with the application to begin your new application.  Your prior ESTA will be cancelled and replaced with your new application.</p>

<p>ESTA approvals are typically granted for a two-year period or until the applicant's passport expires, whichever is sooner. The approval is good for multiple entries - meaning you may use it for more than one entry into the U.S. ESTA provides validity dates upon approval of the application.

"How much cash can we carry to UK and Schengen area from India?","19732","","<p>Will be traveling with my family of 4 to UK and Spain, although we have set up foreign currency cards in GBP and Euro, can we carry cash with us? If yes, how much and does it require some sort of declaration, etc.?</p>
","<h2>As much as you like</h2>

<p><strong>It's your money</strong>, we don't care how much you bring with you: the more you bring, the more you can spend, we're fine with that.</p>

<p>However there are two important things to note</p>

<ol>
<li>You must declare any amount over €10,000 (this applies to the UK as well as the EU, noting that the currency is still Euros when entering the UK! This would be the equivalent of ~£7,800 today, and this <strong>has</strong> caught people out before who were expecting £10,000 not €10,000). If you don't declare your money, it <strong>may be seized</strong> and you can be fined up to <strong>£5,000</strong> (UK, but there are similar repercussions elswehere). Seriously, I can't stress this enough, <strong>declare it</strong>.</li>
<li>You may be expected to explain both where you got the money from, and what you intend to do with it, if the amount is unusual for the purposes of your trip.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note specifically that the €10,000 limit applies to <strong>a combination of all currencies</strong> you bring. eg if you have €5,000, £2,400, and $2,300, that would total over €10,000. Equally if you bring $11,400, that alone is over €10,000. Keep a close eye on the exchange rate in the run up to your trip if there's any chance of you getting close to the limit!</p>

<p>Generally, bringing more than a few thousand in cash is likely to be viewed somewhat suspiciously. You'll likely be allowed through customs with it if you have a reasonable explanation (eg if you're a family of 8 and the father brings €10,000 to pay for a 2 week holiday), but you'll draw far more attention than you need or want.</p>

<p>Unless you absolutely need hard currency, consider bringing travellers cheques and credit/debit cards instead, for the bulk of your funds. It's worth having a few days funds on you in cash, but there's little reason to bring thousands of pounds/euros to the UK/EU.</p>

<p>Note that the €10,000 limit is per person, but I'd suggest that if you have more than this as a group, you declare it anyway to avoid any misunderstandings. Declaring just says ""Hi, Customs, I'm being open and honest about this"", so that they can ask any questions they may have.</p>

<p>With customs: if in doubt, declare it!</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.gov.uk/bringing-cash-into-uk"" rel=""nofollow"">UK Reference</a>, of which much is based on EU law. Please double-check my information, though, as I can't guarantee any of it - particularly for non-UK destinations.</p>

"Why is the price on the shelves for drinks often different from what I actually pay in supermarkets in Germany?","19713","","<p>I have used supermarkets in Germany (REWE, etc). But I found that whenever I purchase a bottled drink the price described on the selves was different from what I actually paid.</p>

<p>For example in one case, one bottled juice was shown 0.95 on the shelf, but the actual price I paid was 1.10.</p>

<p>At first I thought it is just my misunderstanding, but it sounds the same thing happend in most cases (or maybe always).</p>

<p>I also wondered it is due to VAT and the price at the shelf doesn't include it. But <code>0.95 * 1.19 = 1.13</code>, not <code>1.10</code>.</p>

<p>So what is happening here? Is this something like a credit card charge or an entrance charge?</p>

<p>For your information I always used Amex or VISA to make a payment, and buy only one bottled drink which costs about 0.8 to 1.6 on the shelf price.</p>
","<p>You are paying for the drink and a deposit for the bottle. The deposit should be listed on the shelves, but usually in small print. Look for something like ""zzgl. 0,15 Pfand"". As to your initial thought, prices on supermarket shelves include VAT. </p>

<p>There are deposits on many but not all drink containers, the rules are complicated. Deposits apply to non-reusable containers as well as reusable ones, this is to discourage littering and to make sure that the reusable containers are not an economic disadvantage. These deposits can be 8 ct, 10 ct, 15 ct, or 25 ct.</p>

<p>You can reclaim your deposit, even in a different shop than the one where you purchased it, provided they sell the same bottles. Most larger supermarkets have machines to scan the bottles and print out a receipt that can be turned in at the cash register. It is possible to reclaim money even if you do not buy anything.</p>

<p>Most Germans return their empty bottles and claim the deposit, of course. When you do not want to do that, it is considered polite to put the bottle next to a public waste bin, not into it. Some people will collect them and reclaim the deposit as a way to make a little money. </p>

<p>Generally you hear about pregnant women being advised not to fly, but it does happen.  Sometimes the unexpected happens and a baby is born mid-flight.  Assuming it's an international flight and they're not over a country, what nationality does the baby get?</p>
","<p>It's complicated, but as always, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_aboard_aircraft_and_ships"">Wikipedia has it covered</a>.</p>

<p>The short version is that in the vast majority of cases, <strong>the baby will inherit one or more citizenships from its parents</strong> through <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jus_sanguinis""><em>jus sanguinis</em></a>, and nothing more.</p>

<p>If the baby is born within the territorial limits of a country that applies <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jus_soli""><em>jus soli</em></a>, including flying overheard and within nautical limits, the baby <em>may</em> be eligible for citizenship of that country as well.</p>

<p>If the baby's parents are of unknown citizenship, stateless or citizens of countries that don't do <em>jus sanguinis</em> at all (not sure any exist?), and they can't get any citizenships via <em>jus soli</em> (eg. birth occurred in international waters), the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1961_Convention_on_the_Reduction_of_Statelessness"">1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness</a> will kick in:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Article 3</strong></p>
  
  <p>For the purpose of determining the obligations of contracting states under this convention, birth on a ship or aircraft shall amount to birth in the territory of the State that gives its flag to that ship or aircraft.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the birth will be treated as if it occurred in the country that registered the plane or ship.  This doesn't mean the baby automatically gets that country's citizenship, but the Convention aims to ensure that if they can't get anything else, they'll get this as a fallback.</p>

<p>Since not all countries have signed the Convention, and not all countries that signed it have enacted it in law or in practice, it's still possible to fall through the gaps.  Post any interesting cases in the comments ;)</p>

<p>We are unsure of what to do with the ticket. The officer didn't explain anything (he was very rude and threatening, as you can read in the scenario), the paper we got says very little other than 'to report to court within 15 days otherwise a warrant for your arrest will be made'. We left the country hours after we got the speeding ticket. What do we do now? We wish to visit the US/Texas again.</p>

<p>And would it be possible for us to fight the ticket? We believe it was unfair and unnecessary. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We just changed onto a different interstate. Previous interstate was
  75mph, we couldn't find any signs but people were going faster than
  75mph so we decided to 'go with the flow' and drive about 74/75. After
  only minutes on the interstate we got pulled over. The officer came to
  the car with his gun drawn (yes, really!) yelling at us not to move.
  He wouldn't let us speak, he wouldn't let us move. He asked questions
  but didn't let us finish the answers. We made it very clear we were
  tourists in a rental car, yet he proceeded to ask us if we were
  Californian citizens (the car had a Cali license) multiple times.
  After the 3rd time we said we explained where we were from he finally
  put the gun away. He told us what we did wrong and when we tried to explain we were tourists and were just trying to do the right thing, he told us to stop talking. He told us to report to court within 15 days and
  when we tried to explain we were leaving the country and didn't know what to do and he told us in a
  very threatening way we 'better report to court within 15 days or a
  warrant would be put out'.</p>
  
  <p>This all happened at election night, I hope the officer was just
  having a bad day and this is NOT a normal experience with the law in
  the US. I am frankly very scared and do not wish to drive in the US
  anymore.</p>

We really need the jurisdiction of your court in order to provide an official link.  On the other hand this is a good start)</p>

<p>IMHO paying the ticket will be cheaper than hiring a lawyer to represent you and fight the ticket - especially with you not being in the country let alone the state.  I don't think that they can affect your license/insurance in Europe, on the other hand if they issue a warrant for your arrest it will stick around for a very long time and could cause you a lot of grief in the future if you come back to the US.</p>

<p>In either case it would definitely be worthwhile to call the appropriate court and speak to the Court Clerk and get their opinion on the matter.  I'm not sure if you can get it dismissed that way, but it is worth a try.</p>

<p>But whatever you decide make sure to do it before the court date.</p>

<hr>

<p>Finally as a foreigner living in the US I am always amazed at the capriciousness of the cops pulling people over for speeding as well as 10mph over the limit on a freeway being ignored.</p>

<p>From my point of view if the posted speed limit is 60 and everybody does 75 and the cops don't pull everybody over then the de facto speed limit <em>is</em> 75. I just don't have the guts to argue this point in court! </p>

<p>But then every once in a while they do a speeding blitz and start pulling people over for only a few mph over the posted limit.  Then a day later its all back to normal.</p>

"What is the most effective way to use United (MileagePlus) miles?","19635","","<p>Over the past few years I've accumulated enough MileagePlus miles on United for a reward. I've never used miles before, and was wondering how to use them to get the most out of them. Is simply booking a reward ticket through United.com the best way to go? Or is there a more strategic way to spend miles?</p>
","<p>For most Frequent Flyer programs, and especially for United Mileage Plus, the best use of miles is to use them for flights.</p>

<p>United's mileage flight cost is based on regions (with one exception which is distance based for flights less than 700 miles), so there are definitely some flights that are better value than others.</p>

<p>Firstly, there's 2 tiers of flights - ""Saver"" and ""Standard"".  Saver awards are half the cost of Standard awards, but availability is limited, where Standard awards are available on any flight where seats are available for sale.  Obviously this makes Saver awards a better option, but if you're looking at booking a ticket on a near-full flight, a Standard award still might be a good option compared to buying a very expensive paid ticket!</p>

<p>Next there's the class of ticket.  You can book Economy, Business or First class tickets with miles - with Business or First being an amazingly good deal, especially for International.  Business Class tickets cost only about 60% more than Economy, and First are only twice the Economy price.  If you compare that to paying with cash, where business will normally be 3-10 times the economy price, and first even more, it's a great use of miles.</p>

<p>With the exception of flights less than 700 miles, all flights are priced in terms of regions.  eg, anywhere in the US to anywhere else in the US is 25,000 miles return as a saver economy award.  If you were to pay cash, that could cost you anywhere between (say) $150 and $1500 - obviously the best use of miles is when the flight is selling for a much higher price.</p>

<p>International flights are when things can become great value.  eg, a return trip to Australia from anywhere in the US is only 80,000 miles in economy - only about 3 times the cost of a round trip within the US.</p>

<p>The region-based pricing, along with the ability to have a stopover on a return trip means that you can build some fairly good trips.  eg, I recently flew San Francisco to Sydney, then Brisbane to Bangkok, to Singapore, to Hong Kong, and then back to San Francisco - all in Business class, on 4 different airlines, for only 135,000 miles.  That's the same number of miles it would have cost to fly to Sydney alone - but due to the region concept I was able to come back via Asia for the same price as returning direct!  Return bookings allow for one stopover and one open-jaw.</p>

<p>You can also book one-way awards, which are especially useful if flights are expensive in one direction, but cheap in the other.  When comparing paid v's redemption flights, most people work on miles being worth about 2-3 cents each - if it's cheaper than that, just pay cash, otherwise consider using miles.  eg, if a flight will cost 12,500 miles (one-way economy saver award), and you can buy it for $125, then pay cash!  However if the same flight will cost $400 (ie, 3.2 cents/mile), then it's a good opportunity to use miles.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> A few months ago United changed the prices for some of it's award flights. The biggest change was that some awards on ""partner"" airlines, especially in business/first class, now cost more than the United equivalents.  Most everything above still holds, but in terms of best value for points, premium cabin flights on United airlines now work out cheaper than premium cabin flights on other partner/Star Alliance airlines.</p>

"In the context of air travel, are layovers different to stopovers?","19617","","<p>In a recent question somebody <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/7140/how-does-customs-work-if-my-layover-is-in-a-third-country"">asked about a <em>layover</em></a> without mentioning how long the stop would be, thus implying it might perhaps be understood whether <em>layover</em> generally refers to a stop not requiring an overnight stay.</p>

<p>In Australia where I'm from we don't really use <em>layover</em> but we're familiar with it from American TV and movies, in which travellers never appear to take breaks between flights to stay a few days.</p>

<p>In Australia we do use <em>stopover</em> (it can also be spelled <em>stop over</em> and <em>stop-over</em>) and very often we do take a break on our flights, because they can be very long, to stay one night or many nights in a destination other than our ultimate destination.</p>

<p>So is it that <em>layover</em> means a short break where you just hang around in the aiport and <em>stopover</em> means a long break where you'll spend some nights in a second place en route to your destination?</p>

<p>Or is it that both words mean a stop, either short or long, and the only difference is which is the more popular in each country?</p>

","<p>There are two issues here: what people mean, and what airlines mean.</p>

<p>Airlines vary, but generally they mean layover to mean you changing planes for their reasons. They don't fly from London to Venice, for example, so they fly you London to Frankfurt then Frankfurt to Venice. You might have an hour or two in the airport to change planes. They mean stopover to mean something you choose to do, like if you want a day or two in London on your trip from Toronto to Frankfurt. Typically they will allow you one free stopover (or two) but not more. Layovers, being a more technical issue, are not limited.</p>

<p>Some people do clever things, if they'r on a routing that involves a layover, like coming in at 2pm and going out at 10 am (less than 24 hours) giving themselves an afternoon and evening in the layover city for free. This is where you see people making a strong distinction between layover and stopover. It was a layover to the airline, so it didn't cost anything, but the person got the goodies we usually associate with a stopover.</p>

<p>Other people just say layover when they don't leave the airport, for a short connection, and stopover when they do leave the airport and spend some time in the actual city. Or they'll use stopover if it's overnight. You can't be sure what someone means, but it probably doesn't matter much. The words are very similar when they don't affect the fare you paid for your flight.</p>

"What is the actual (not official) size of the Ryanair ""baggage sizer""?","19556","","<p>I know that this question could sound a little bit dumb since Ryanair always sends lot of emails specifying the dimensions of the allowed hand luggage but I am not interested in the ""formal"" answer but in the ""informal"" one.</p>

<p>In every airport where Ryanair flies there is a blue box (baggage sizer) where you and the airport staff can put your hand luggage to test if it can be accepted on board. What I would like to know is the dimension of that box (which is of course bigger than the allowed size).</p>

<p>I've been a pretty frequent Ryanair flyer (one flight per month) and I always used the same luggage which was ok for the old box even if bigger than the allowed size. </p>

<p>Few weeks ago Ryanair introduced the possibility to bring a second hand luggage on board. In doing so they also changed the dimensions of the blue box which now has two compartments (one for the main hand luggage, still bigger than the allowed size, and one for the small one). 
My old luggage doesn't fit anymore in the new boxes so I guess I'll have to buy a new one, hence the need to know how far can I go with the size of the luggage.</p>
","<p>I measured the box in BSL and it was 21,2 x 41,2 x 58 cm (8.3"" x 16.22"" x 22.8""). However, the 58 cm are not exact because firstly the box has two rounded rods at the bottom, which makes it slightly smaller at these points, but it's open to the top so this dimension won't matter to much I guess.</p>

"What is way to eat rice with hands in front of westerners such that it doesn't appear to be yucky?","19507","","<p>In India, we eat rice <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette_of_Indian_dining"">using our fingers</a>.

That indeed looks disgusting. </p>

<p>I cannot avoid hurting them by following different etiquette, but I certainly want to maintain a degree of cleanliness.</p>
","<p>Who are you trying to eat in front of? There's no single answer here.</p>

<p>If it's strangers: there is no way. You must always respect local custom in order to meet the standards of etiquette local to your surroundings. Use a fork, spoon, or chopsticks (chopsticks are not local custom in the West but are seen as exotic rather than uncouth).</p>

<p>If it's business relationships or customers: use a fork. You could make relationships that allow you to eat with your fingers but it is not worth it; respect local norms and make your business relationships easier.</p>

<p>If it's friends, colleagues, or classmates: eat with your fingers and <em>talk to them</em> about Indian norms. They should respect your culture and, indeed, be interested in it. If they're not, stop wasting your time with them.</p>

<p>If it's a potential romantic partner: eat with a fork the first time then start doing it your way. You need to signal that you're capable of behaving in public but you should then relax into whatever makes you happy. If they can't deal with your cultural differences, avoid that relationship.</p>

"How to check a large backpack?","19484","","<p>When travelling on airlines based in the US with a large backpack, I prefer to carry the bag onto the plane as part of my hand baggage allowance.

I managed to repair it, and I'm still using the same pack, but I would like to avoid so many broken parts in the future.  </p>

"In Canada for 6 months, going back to US, how long until I can come back?","19459","","<p>I'm a US citizen and online business owner. I've been in Canada for 141 days, and have a permitted 180 day stay. I want to leave to the USA to basically reset the 180 days. Can I do that? I don't think I can apply for the visa extension because I'm not ""working"" in their country by their standards (since it's online) and I'm not a student. </p>

<p>So my questions are:
1.) Can I leave and come back? 
2.) If so, how long do I need to be gone?
3.) CAN I apply for an extended visa? Although I never needed one to begin with as a US citizen. (&lt;--cant find this answer on the CIC website)</p>
","<p>The very next day, if you can convince the border agent that you're using your visa for the appropriate means, and aren't trying to 'live' there instead.</p>

<p>They're going to wonder what took 141 days and now needs more.  If you're backpacking across the country, say, they can see evidence of your travels and you can show that say, you were now heading up to Churchill to see the polar bears and therefore need another few weeks.  They're going to want to know how long you're going for this time, and what you're planning on doing.</p>

<p>It gets a bit more unclear if you're a digital nomad like yourself.  Technically you're working for a US company from Canada. Some countries and guards can be very iffy on that.  Essentially, they may see it as you living and earning money there, benefiting from their roads and so on, without paying and Canadian taxes. And that's not approved.</p>

<p>However, if you provide them with your business address and show that you're travelling as a tourist as well, it might be deemed more acceptable.</p>

<p>Short version: You're going to have to convince the border agent that you're not living there tax-free, but are a bona-fide visitor, there for normal visitor reasons, who plans on returning to the US where you live.</p>

<p>EDIT: Indeed, from the <a href=""http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/apply-who.asp"" rel=""noreferrer"">Canadian Immigration website</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To visit Canada, you must:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>have a valid travel document, such as a passport,</li>
  <li>be in good health,</li>
  <li><strong>convince an immigration officer that you have ties—such as a job, home, financial assets or family—that will take you back to your home
  country,</strong></li>
  <li><strong>convince an immigration officer that you will leave Canada at the end of your visit</strong>, and</li>
  <li>have enough money for your stay. (The amount of money you will need can vary. it depends on things like how long you will stay, and
  whether you will stay in a hotel or with friends or relatives.)</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I've highlighted the key bit. If it's apparent or seems that your plan is just to keep re-entering Canada, they may well disqualify you.  Indeed, when I lived in Vancouver I had a friend from Utah who went to renew her visa, and was seen to be 'living' there (She was actually trying to move to Vancouver long term, just did things in the wrong order) and was given 2 days to pack up and leave.

"Where are the shopping areas in Rome?","19387","","<p>My girlfriend and I are visiting Rome soon and she mentioned yesterday that she may like to explore the shopping district when it occurred to us that we didn't know where that was.</p>

<p>We want to visit the popular big shops but we'd also like to visit some local independent shops. (Maybe an Italian market if there is one).</p>

<p>Are there shopping areas like this in Rome. If so, where will we find them?</p>
","<p>From Wikitravel's <a href=""http://wikitravel.org/en/Rome#Buy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">great piece on Rome</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rome has excellent shopping opportunites of all kinds - clothing and jewellery (it has been nominated as a top fashion capital) to art and antiques. You also get some big department stores, outlets and shopping centres, notably in the suburbs and outskirts.</p>
  
  <p>Main shopping areas include Via del Corso, Via Condotti, and the surrounding streets. The finest designer stores are around Via Condotti, whilst Via del Corso has more affordable clothing, and Via Cola di Rienzo, and the surroundings of Via del Tritone, Campo de'Fiori, and Pantheon are the places to go for cheaper items. Upim is a good shop for cheap clothing of workable quality. Some brands (like Miss Sixty and Furla) are excellent, some are not as good - be sure to feel garments and try them on. There are also great quality shoes and leather bags at prices that compare well with the UK and US. But when shopping for clothes note that bigger sizes than a UK size 16/US 12 aren't always easy to find. Children's clothing can be expensive with basic vests (tank tops) costing as much as €21 in non-designer shops. If you really need to buy clothers for kids try the Oviesse chain. Summer sales in many stores begin around July 15th and Rome also has New Year sales.</p>
  
  <p>As mentioned above, Via Condotti is Rome's top haute couture fashion street (equivalent of Fifth Avenue in New York City, Via Montenapoleone in Milan, or Bond Street in London). Here, you can find big brand names such as Gucci, Armani, Dior, Valentino and Hermès, and several other high-class shops. However, the streets around the Via Condotti, such as Via Frattina, Via del Babuino, Via Borgognona and the Piazza di Spagna also offer some excellent high fashion boutiques, including Roberto Cavalli, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Versace, Prada and Givenchy (and several others). So once in the city, the big boutique names aren't absent. In these luxurious streets, however, you needen't only do clothing shopping - there are some really good and funky jewellery (e.g. Bulgari, Cartier, Tiffany's &amp; Co.), pen and accessory (i.e. Mont Blanc) and artsy stores peppered here and there in these streets.</p>
  
  <p>If you want to spend a day in a large shopping mall, there's the Euroma2 with about 230 shops (mainly clothes and accessories) and restaurants, to be found near the EUR district. Take Metro B line from Termini to EUR Palasport station, cross the road and take the frequent free bus (ride takes 5-15 minutes) to the mall. In addition to many shops and food, the conditioned air and free toilets may be a welcome relief if you are in Rome during mid-summer. La Rinascente, Rome's first department store, having been opened in 1887, is also a good retail department store, selling fashion, design, houseware and beauty products. If you like Abercrombie &amp; Fitch or Hollister, you have an Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Italia store in the Via Collatina.</p>

"What's a cheap ski location to reach from Amsterdam (Netherlands)?","19284","","<p>What are the cheapest ski localities I can go in a weekend if I live in Amsterdam (in the Netherlands).</p>

<p>I want reasonably good ski runs (I'm not a beginner), and outdoor.
Should I go to France? Austria? Any tips?</p>

<p>I've seen there are some localities in Germany, but I was wondering if they are so attractive.</p>

<p>Good criteria to choose the destination:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is not just the distance, but how easy is to reach with cheap flights/train </li>
<li>In particular, not just how cheap is the flight, but also how easy it is to reach the ski resort from the airport</li>
<li>How cheap is the ski resort</li>
<li>How convenient it is for a short stay (2-3 days)</li>
</ul>
","<p>There is a daily train leaving Amsterdam at 20:31 and arriving in Munich at 7:10 the following day. The trains leaves Munich at 22:47 each evening and arrives in Amsterdam at 8:56. The price very much depends on when you travel, when you book and how much comfort you want to have. <a href=""http://www.citynightline.de/citynightline/view/nl/index.shtml"">Details can be found on the Cityline website</a>.</p>

<p>From Munich you can take a local train to Garmisch-Partenkirchen, at the foot of the Zugspitze. It's a 90 minutes ride. <a href=""http://www.bahn.de"">Schedules and prices can be checked at the Bahn's website</a>.</p>

<p>The train continues to Innsbruck. You can consider that as well. In this case, take an accomadation in Innsbruck. There is a small ski resort, the Patscherkofel, accessible from the city center by funicular and cable car. If that's not enough, you have some nice resorts which can easily be reached by a bus shuttle from Innsbruck, such as the Stubaier Gletscher, Schlick 2000 or Axamer Lizum. This way you can spend a nice skiing weekend without having to renounce to the amenities of a city.</p>

<p>The train also calls at Wörgl, from where you have a very quick access to the very nice ""Wilder Kaiser"" resort. </p>

<p>In case you don't like to take the train, flying from Amsterdam into Munich will probably not ruin you. But it's much less convenient. From Munich airport to Garmisch-Partenkirchen is more than 2h30 and you have the usual airport hassle. And probably less convenient schedules. The night train allows you to get the most out of your scarce time.</p>

<p>If you are francophile, you can consider a flight to Geneva. With Easyjet you will find decent prices. From the Geneva airport you have bus shuttles to plenty of French and Swiss resorts. This will take you 1h30 to 2h00, depending on the destination. Schedules are available on the homepage of Geneva's airport. If ""cheapness"" is an important criterion, prefer France over Switzerland. </p>

<p>I would also try to contact local tour operators and travel agencies. Chances are high that they have ready made packages just for short ski trips. Eventually, that might be the most convenient option. You just have to go to the office and book it. They take care of the logistics. It is not necessarily more expensive than if you try to brew something by yourself.</p>

"Free / cheap ways to get airport lounge access?","19241","","<p>Until recently, I had a complimentary <a href=""http://www.prioritypass.com/"">Priority Pass</a> card. Although the Priority Pass lounges aren't generally great, they are better than nothing when travelling on an airline where you don't have frequent flyer status.</p>

<p>Priority Pass is extremely expensive, however, and to me at least isn't worth paying for.</p>

<p>What other free or cheap ways are there of getting access to a lounge apart from Priority Pass and having frequent flyer status? I live in the UK, if it's relevant.</p>
","<p>Well, if you are traveling for business or in some other arrangement where <strong>someone else is paying for airfare</strong>, achieving elite frequent flyer status in a program is quite cheap. Being the <strong>travel companion of someone who has access</strong> is another route.</p>

<p>Somewhat more seriously, <strong>flying intercontinentally in a premium cabin</strong> (or in a few selected services, such as United p.s.) will also generally get you a same-day lounge invitation. Of course, it's only a bargain if you're on a frequent flyer award ticket or upgrade and comparing it to the full price of the ticket. Also, you may have to live with a lesser lounge if you are on an award as opposed to a revenue fare on some airlines; I want to say Singapore Airlines is one of the persnickety ones.</p>

<p><strong>Some credit cards come with lounge access.</strong> The American Express Centurion card gets you into most airline lounges; holding an AmEx Platinum card gives you Priority Pass Select access. Chase has a card that will give you United Club access. That said, the annual fees on these cards is quite substantial, comparable to the cost of purchasing a separate lounge membership. They are a value only if you already have a card, if you are switching from a comparable card that lacks lounge access, or if someone else is paying the annual fee (e.g. your company for a business card).</p>

<p>Depending on your travel patterns, it may be worthwhile to get membership in a <strong>frequent flyer program with more liberal rules</strong> about status. For example, Star Alliance Gold generally gets you access to any Star Alliance business class lounge when traveling on any Star Alliance flight.* On United Airlines it takes 50,000 elite qualifying miles in a calendar year to achieve Premier Gold, which is their lowest Star Alliance Gold level. On the other hand, to achieve Gold status on Aegean Airlines (also Star Alliance Gold level), you need only 20,000 EQMs. Overall, if you mostly fly United, accruing to the Aegean program is a bad deal, as you will not be able to take advantage of United promotions or United program benefits like Economy Plus access or upgrades. But if lounge access is the main thing you care about, and you book fares that accrue at least 40% EQMs for flight mileage, this is a faster way to get it.</p>

<p>* <em>Note that Star Alliance Gold lounge access is restricted if your status is in a US-based programs, i.e. United (and formerly Continental) and US Airways. You cannot use a United Club as a United Gold Premier unless you are traveling on a same-day international itinerary. US Airways is even more restrictive, as they disallow lounge access to Gold Preferred members for most Caribbean and Central American flights as well. Similar restrictions apply for American and Delta, in the other two major alliances.</em></p>

<p>Another option that may work is to <strong>purchase one-time airline lounge passes— from someplace other than the airline</strong>. United charges $50 for a one-time entry into a United Club, which pretty much anyone who has been in almost any United Club will tell you is a colossal waste of money. However, sometimes people get passes as gifts or other compensation who don't want or need them, and they may give them away or try to sell them. Depending on the type of pass and the airline in question, the pass may not be transferable, but for the ones that are, you'll be able to shave a few dollars off entry by getting one from Craigslist or eBay.</p>

<p>Yet another area to investigate are <strong>low-cost lounge offerings</strong>. I haven't flown them in years, but Bangkok Airways allowed anyone holding a ticket access to their lounge. Of course, the price of that was built into the ticket, and you expected to pay a little more than say AirAsia. Some airports offer non-affiliated lounges, such as the <a href=""http://www.bwiairport.com/en/shops/shop-dine/store/airspacelounge"">Airspace Lounge</a> at BWI which starts at $17.50. </p>

<p>None of the above options is particularly cheap, but if everyone off the street could get into the lounge cheap and easy, there would cease to be any point going there— it would be as noisy and crowded as the terminal.</p>

"How to cope with too slow Wi-Fi at hotel?","19238","","<p>So many hotels I stayed at (3~4 stars ratings) provided too slow Wi-Fi. The speed is somewhere around 2~3Mbps, and it frequently falls down to &lt;200Kbps.</p>

<p>However, once you find that your hotel provides such a terrible Wi-Fi environment, is there anything still that you can take an action there? In hotel search websites, many hotels are tagged with <em>Free Wi-Fi</em> or even <em>Hi-Speed Wi-Fi</em> but it is not reliable in my experience. </p>

<p>Note that I'm not asking for whether it is possible to know the quality of Wi-Fi at hotel in advance, which has been posted <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/1836/is-there-any-way-of-evaluating-the-quality-of-a-hotels-internet-connection-in-a"">in this question</a>. What I ask here is <strong>how you can deal with it when you find your hotel provides a terrible Wi-Fi</strong>.</p>

<p>Usually, I get through it by going into cafe with 
Wi-Fi. But still, the cafe might not provide you with a good connection. Also I want to use my Mac in midnight, when most cafes are not open in general.</p>

<p>I also make sure to contract a local SIM with 4G/LTE and tethering capability, but still, the tethering fails to connect too frequently in many cases.</p>

<p>This is what is happening on me right now in Shanghai, that the hotel's is terrible, all cafes I tried (including Starbucks) suck, and China Unicom 4G/LTE is too slow even without VPN. It's really stressful...</p>

<p>So is there still anything I can do to assure the good network environment? (except changing the hotel which I do once the current booking ends)</p>

<p>My point is that I want to use my Mac whenever I want (including midnight), since it is a part of my job (working while traveling). <strong>The minimum requirement is a stable access to GitHub and Stack Overflow and fast google search responses. I don't need much speed (around 7 ~ 10Mbps is sufficient) but cannot tolerate &lt;2Mbps, since it takes me to wait for so long. For me, the stable, undisconnected network is far more important than the speed and latency, once it is above 3Mbps. I don't download/upload large files at once (e.g. videos or hi-res pictures or big softwares, those with >500MB).</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>If a list of countries is required, I ask for Hong Kong and China (Shanghai/Beijing). But this occurred in Singapore and Japan as well. South Korea never bothered me in this regard, though, as the major cities are full of terrific Wi-Fi cafes. </p>
","<p>At first, I thought it would be sort of difficult to answer this. The only options are hotel WiFi and 4G/LTE, and it's not always easy to do much about the speed of those. (Except for the fact that the speed given by various 4G/LTE carriers may vary, so you could check reviews of those before picking your carrier.)</p>

<p>Then I remembered something called <a href=""http://speedify.com/desktop/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Speedify</a>. It's a multi-platform service which utilizes <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_bonding"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">channel bonding</a> to allow you to fuse multiple internet connections into one. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By using a technology known as <strong>channel bonding</strong> Speedify makes it
  possible to spread individual packets amongst multiple Internet
  connections. By splitting all your web traffic at the packet-level
  even large single socket transfers such as VPNs, streaming movies, and
  uploading and downloading files can be given a major speed boost!</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aba8c.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aba8c.png"" width=""300""></a></p>

<p>This would allow you to be connected to an LTE mobile connection and the hotel WiFi at the <em>same time</em>. If speed is very important to you, you could even join multiple LTE connections together. Of course, for that, you'd need multiple LTE modems and SIMs. That would, of course, increase your expenses. But then, you're asking for high-speed internet while traveling, which is not going to be free in any case.</p>

<p>You mention that both LTE and WiFi speeds are unstable and fluctuate. Being connected through multiple connections at the same time would be a good protection against this, as you'd maintain an acceptable speed even when one of your connections goes slow or disconnects altogether.</p>

"Can I ask for two meals for my flight without paying extra?","19226","","<p>I know, this is a funny/sort of stingy question, but the last time I took a plane, after having the meal they serve, I was still kind of hungry so my girlfriend told me to ask for another one. I didn't do it but I kept wondering if it was possible.</p>

<p>Is there anyone that works on an airline that could confirm how it works for these cases?</p>
","<p>A cabin crew member here...</p>

<p>In general, flight attendants will be happy to give you the extra meal after the service is done, because they know it will be <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/19850/do-airlines-recycle-uneaten-unopened-pre-packaged-food/19852#19852"">thrown after landing</a> anyway. Out of experience, there are always some extra meals, at least one or two. Sometimes passengers simply do not take a meal, some other times there's just an extra meal or two loaded for whatever reason. In some other flights, there's a shortage actually. They usually cover for this by using the crew meals, and this is rare anyway.</p>

<h2>Is it ok?</h2>

<p>Yes, nothing wrong with it, flight attendants will not think badly of you. As long as you ask nicely, of course. One more thing, all meals usually get heated at the same time. Once heated they are good to be eaten for a certain time, then they can't be served to passengers. So, if you feel you want an extra meal, ask for it. I have seen so much food being wasted while I was sure many people were hungry but were shy just like you. </p>

<h2>When to ask</h2>

<p>When they are serving you, give them a hint that you would love to have an extra meal if it's possible after they are done. Personally, when this happens I might give them right away if I know that there are extra meals. Otherwise I will just wait until service is done and then come back with the extra meal, or apologize if I couldn't find any.</p>

<p>Note: I am talking about full service airlines. For budget airlines where food is bought onboard, you can pay extra and get more food. That's a different story. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>You may carry liquids, gels and aerosols in your carry-on bags only if
  they adhere to the 3-1-1 rule: containers must be 3.4 ounces or less;
  stored in a 1 quart/liter zip-top bag; 1 zip-top bag per person,

  <p>Medically
  required liquids, such as baby formula and food, breast milk and

  quantities for the flight. It is not necessary to place medically

  Medically required liquids will be subjected to additional screening

</blockquote>

<p>The problem is, I've been able to do this once (domestic), however the second time I had it taken away (international). </p>

<p>The time that I had it taken away was when I actually told the dude I had it in my bag, they removed it, kept it, and told me it was not allowed. </p>

<p>Is this up to the discretion of the TSA officer, or is it due to the fact I was in the international terminal versus the domestic terminal? I don't really see the difference.</p>
","<p>You quote the TSA:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Medically required liquids, such as baby formula and food, breast milk and medications are allowed in excess of 3.4 ounces in reasonable quantities for the flight. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The key is ""reasonable quantities for the flight.""  For most people, 3.4 ounces of contact lens solution is far more than would be needed for a single flight.  If you need more contact lens solution than that for use at your destination, you are supposed to put it in your checked baggage.  For longer trips, therefore, you would need two bottles: a small travel bottle for use on the plane and a larger bottle for use after you arrive at your destination.</p>

<p>I don't know why the TSA would have allowed you to take a larger bottle on the domestic flight.  I can imagine that any of several reasons might apply.  For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>The TSA officer may have been unfamiliar with contact lenses, and therefore unfamiliar with the amount of solution one typically needs to use.</li>
<li>The TSA officer may have decided that you didn't represent a threat, and therefore may have exercised discretion (which may or may not have been in keeping with the rules) to allow you to retain the solution.</li>
<li>Re-reading your question, I note that you don't say whether you actually discussed the contact lens solution with the officer when you were allowed to keep it.  If you did not, they may simply not have noticed it.  I've once or twice accidentally carried bottles of liquid through that the TSA screeners missed.</li>
<li>If you <em>did</em> discuss the solution with the TSA, as I noted in my comment, it may just be that the TSA officer was not in the mood to argue, or that you are a particularly skilled negotiator.  That's kind of frightening, but it's possible.</li>
</ul>

<p>I do not know whether TSA rules allow laxer screening of domestic flights, but I doubt it.</p>

","<p>Mark's answer is kinda perfect, but I will give some extra information as a cabin crew member:</p>

<h2>The bad:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Lavatory noise (flushing noise is so loud due to air suction)</li>
<li>Babies noise, the bulkhead behind almost all lavatories are where baby basinets installed. People with babies usually reserve these seats.</li>
<li>Crowd (queues)</li>
<li>You can't recline the seat enough (if seated in front of lavatory bulkhead)</li>
<li>Not dark enough at night (because of lavatory light when door is open, lot's of lit signs next to lavatories)</li>
<li>Usually lavatories are next to cabin crew stations, depending on the airplane type there could be a lot of chimes and calls to the cabin crew station, which means extra noise. Boeing planes in particular are a bit noisy when it comes to chimes.</li>
<li>Bad smell.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The good:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Lavatory is one step away.</li>
<li>As I said before, usually there are cabin crew stations next to lavatories. The good side is, the closer you are to cabin crew the better you get served especially in long flights.</li>
<li>If you do not sleep in airplanes, next to lavatories (and galleys) are the social places in airplanes, you can talk to people who are waiting for their turns or just stretching their legs there.</li>
<li>More leg space as you already mentioned (row behind, this is by design actually to give more space to baby basinets)</li>

  <p>We have received complaints from foreign buyers that they were
  incorrectly advised by retailers that they could receive a refund of

  They were told they could do this by presenting their receipts at the
  airport. Although many countries have such a provision for foreign
  travelers, California does not.</p>

"Do I need a UK or Ireland transit visa when flying from the US to a Schengen country?","19079","","<p>I am travelling to Budapest and therefore have a Schengen Visa.

<p><em>Hoping this will help someone someday</em>. </p>

<p>I was not allowed to board my return flight (BUD-DUB-ORD) because I do not hold an overnight Irish Transit Visa.

"Can I get from Gatwick airport to London by Oyster card?","18936","","<p>I read many contradictions as to whether one can use a Oyster card from Gatwick Airport to central London.</p>

<p>What is the most time-efficient way to go from Gatwick to ""Old Billingsgate"" (Monument tube station is nearby)? Public transportation is preferred over taxi.</p>
","<p>Since January 2016 you can use your Contactless or Oyster card to travel from Gatwick to London on both normal rail services, and the Gatwick Express.</p>

<p>The prices for single fares on <strong>normal services</strong> can be found in the <a href=""https://tfl.gov.uk/fares-and-payments/fares/single-fare-finder"" rel=""noreferrer"">Single Fare Finder</a>, and based on it a trip from Gatwick to East Croydon costs £5.20 peak / £3.00 off peak, to London Bridge (or other southern rail terminal like Victoria) it would cost £14.20/£8.10 and across the city (Rail + Underground including travelling in Zone 1) £16.50/£10.30.</p>

<p>Note that based on these prices it's apparently cheaper to go from Gatwick only until East Croydon for £5.20 peak, exit the station, and re-enter to continue until Victoria or London Bridge for £5.10, as that would only cost £10.30 in total (compared to £14.20 for the trip without splitting the journey in Croydon)</p>

<p>Caps also apply, the daily cap is £31.00 peak and £19.30 off peak for any London zone. Apparently there is also a weekly contactless only cap of £102.20, which is actually a few pounds cheaper than a weekly rail season ticket would cost between Gatwick and London zones 1-6.</p>

<p>Prices on the <strong>Gatwick Express</strong> however are different, they cost £19.80 at any time, and don't count towards any of the daily and weekly caps.</p>

<p>Note that Gatwick was already added to the <a href=""http://content.tfl.gov.uk/london-rail-and-tube-services-map.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">TFL rail map</a></p>

<p>Since these prices are not all available to download in PDF form, and you have to use the single fare finder, I made a small table that shows some of the possible combinations of stations to/from Gatwick Airport. </p>

<p>Prices up to date as of 23/05/2017 - Prices were unchanged between Gatwick and Croydon since 2016. There were £0.10-£0.50 increases on the rest of the network.

However, in the duration of my trip, I was planning to go to Tokyo as well, but I'd prefer to do that part of the trip with only a backpack. </p>

<p>Is there a place where I can leave my bags safe whilst I'm away from Osaka? </p>

IMHO it would make sense to leave the luggage in the station/airport from which you would be departing/returning when heading/coming back from Tokyo.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Outside the Southern Shinkansen Gate at Shin-Osaka (which puts you on the 3rd floor of the station – see map but it won’t show the luggage room) you will go down two more floors to First Floor to get to the bus pickup. At the bottom of the steps to 1F turn left to see Central Gate and the bus and car area outside, as well as some bicycle parking just past a convenience store. Go left on the other side of that convenience store and you can see the luggage storage at the end of the walk up a short ramp for your suitcase’s rollers.</p>

  It is 620 yen to leave a suitcase for one day, 360 yen for a Boston bag, 1,030 yen to leave a coat for 4 days or less (from the 5th day, 210 yen is added per day), and large items such as surfboards may be left for 1,030 yen a day.</p>

"Schengen tourist visa refused.

<p>But my company has sanctioned me leave considering the fact that 02-Nov-13 to 5-Nov-13 are office holidays.<br>
I wouldn't blame the consulate because they wouldn't know that and they consider mismatching dates to be a discrepancy.</p>

<p>Now, what could I do?<br>
Shall I appeal for a reconsideration without paying the visa fee again? If yes, how do I do that? And also, what is the probability that they would reconsider again?</p>

<p>Or, shall I reapply fresh again with a correction in my leave letter from the office?
I have sent a mail to the consulate but they haven't replied.</p>
","<p>Ah, German nitpicking... <em>Willkommen in Deutschland!</em></p>

<p>But have no fear, since this is Germany there's a well-defined process for appealing.  The German Embassy in Manila, Philippines has a <a href=""http://www.manila.diplo.de/contentblob/3618522/Daten/3484965/MB_remonstration_aug13.pdf"">useful fact sheet</a> about how to apply for a ""remonstration against"" (their term!) the visa rejection, and I'm sure more or less the same process applies for the Chennai consulate.  Quoting the relevant bits:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can remonstrate only in writing, and your remonstration must
  contain the following details:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Your name, first name, date of birth, place of birth, and the number of your passport </li>
  <li>The date your application was rejected </li>
  <li>A serviceable address that contains the street name, house- or apartment number, City/ Town/ Village,  postal code, if applicable:
  please state your e-mail address </li>
  <li>The remonstration must be signed by your own hand (a remonstration by a third party e.g. your sponsor,  can only be accepted and
  processed if you have given your sponsor a power of attorney, which is
  submitted with the remonstration).</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>And</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you applied for a visa of the category „C“ (Schengenvisa),  the
  deadline for filing the remonstration is one (1) month after your
  received the letter of rejection.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can submit by mail, fax or e-mail, but if e-mail, you have to send in a scan of a printed letter with your signature.</p>

<p>And obviously the better you can explain the discrepancy (a revised letter and/or note from your office should do nicely), the higher the chances of success.</p>

<p>Incidentally, if your remonstration also fails you can apparently try once more with the High Court in Berlin, but that's probably a bit overkill for a tourist visa...</p>

<p>So, ignoring the practical ""don't be an idiot"" and ""don't drive faster than you can handle,"" at what speeds would die Polizei be pulling you over?</p>

<p>Bonus points for translating km/hr into miles/hr.</p>
","<p>The statement 'there is no speed limit on the Autobahn' is not really correct. I couldn't find any official statistics, but I've seen a number of only 50% of German Autobahns without any limit.</p>

<p>Many parts have a permanent limits of 120 or 130 km/h (74 mph or 81 mph). Some parts are limited to 80 (50 mph) due to construction work.</p>

<p>Also, some limits are only for wet roads. Finally many parts have dynamic speed limit signs that change based on the traffic situation.</p>

<p>Even though there is no general limit for the 50%, there is a recommended speed of 130 km/h (81 mph). If you are going much faster and there is an accident, it is more likely you are blamed for it (if you survive it, which is unlikely).</p>

<p>Autobahn police can still pull you over for reckless driving or driving too fast in certain situations even when there was no limit.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How fast may you drive on the Autobahn?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This really depends on the situation, there are some stretches in less populated areas that get relatively light traffic and you can drive 200 km/h (125 mph) with no problem. It also depends on the time of day. There is rush hour traffic that limits your speed anyways. Late at night it is usually empty and you can go fast.</p>

<p>It also depends on you car, it makes a big difference if you go 200 km/h in a big BMW or Porsche or a smaller older car. It is also much more tiring to go fast, you have to concentrate much more at 200 than 120 because any tiny mistake has much bigger consequences.</p>

<p>I had several friends visiting from overseas, renting a car and then were too scared to drive really fast. If you are planning to go fast, start with a speed you are comfortable with from home and then increase it over time. Don't go 230 km/h (143 mph) as soon as you hit the Autobahn for the first time.</p>

"Will I be able to travel around India speaking only English?","18783","","<p>I am to travel around some Indian cities: Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and others. Will I have trouble speaking only English, or should I learn some phrases in Hindi?</p>
","<p>I have backpacked around a fair bit in India - I grew up there, by the way - and yet I still mostly had to use English to get myself understood when I was visiting other states.There are at least 22 languages in use in India. The curious thing is even for Indians it is often English that is the binding thread - the one language that I could communicate in any part of the country I was travelling.</p>

<p>Hindi is useful primarily in the north and western regions of India. People will be lot more friendly to you even if you can speak basic Hindi phrases and less inclined to rip you off. Having said that, correct pronunciation in Hindi can be tough to master. It's sort of like learning Chinese - when you don't get the tones right, they won't understand what your 'Chinese' means. While Hindi is not a tonal language per se, it does have elements where tone and stress play a part unlike they do in English.</p>

<p>If you plan to go off the beaten track and into rural areas, then I would very much suggest you to learn Hindi phrases and <em>try</em> to get pronunciation right. People in cities can often compensate for wrong pronunciations because they are used to it, but people in smaller towns often cannot. In most situations, they will try to help you though by getting hold of someone who does understand English.</p>

<p>Now, for southern parts of India - Bangalore, for instance, as you mention in your itinerary - you will find less people capable of speaking and understanding Hindi, and in addition to the regional language of the state English is the de facto second language. In fact, speaking in Hindi can sometimes be taken as insult in the southern states because it is seen as 'north India' imposing an alien language upon them.</p>

<p>That implies they no longer want their gadget from last year or two years ago. So I'm hoping I can buy a used smartphone at a bargain price. But so far I can't find any for sale!</p>

","<p>There are a huge amount of new phone shops almost everywhere, but I hardly remember where used phone stores are. Probably the reason will be simple--there's no money in the used phone business.</p>

<p>Buying a new phone in Korea also means signing a contract (usually for 2 years) with a mobile service provider. It makes money for manufacturers, mobile service providers, and distributors (sellers). Buyers must use it and pay it for two years, or otherwise pay back a penalty for breach. For that reason, people could buy a phone at a lower price than its release price with some support from mobile service provider.</p>

<p>Thinking about buying a new phone without a contract. It is almost impossible in Korea. Manufacturers sell the phone only through mobile service providers with a contract. Even if there are some products to sell, you should pay its release price.</p>

<p>Then, if we brought a new one, where were the used phones going? If I want to buy used one (or want to sell my out-dated one), I'll definitely go to on-line market. Actually, there are some well-known market and communities:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""http://gmarket.co.kr"" rel=""nofollow"">Gmarket</a> / <a href=""http://auction.co.kr"" rel=""nofollow"">Auction</a> : Both in the eBay family, usually phones are sold by phone brokers. Very little information or photos of used phones. Hard to figure out its conditions. Only supports Korean.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://joonggonara.co.kr"" rel=""nofollow"">Joong-go-na-ra</a> : The biggest on-line flea market forum in Korea. Sold by individuals. Based on Naver service (Korean portal). Be aware there's many scammers! Only supports Korean.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://ppomppu.co.kr"" rel=""nofollow"">Ppom-ppu</a> : Well-known community for sharing information all about phones. User-based community. Sold by individuals. Only supports Korean.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://cetizen.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Cetizen</a> : Also a lot of used phone deals happen here. Sold by individuals. Only supports Korean.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I think these four are very lively communities for used phones. It is sad most communities only support Korean. </p>

<p>p.s. Speaking of pawnbrokers - we are very unfamiliar with 'pawnbrokers'. In most cases other than very urgently needed money, we never go there.</p>

"Able to carry on a small Swiss army knife","18673","","<p>I usually carry around a small Swiss army kit my set of keys which contains a small knife inside the slot which is about 1 inch in height and very thin (see link for better picture, and it is described as a blade, not a knife in the picture) </p>

<p><a href=""https://www.swissarmy.com/us/en/Products/Swiss-Army-Knives/Small-Pocket-Knives/Classic-SD/p/0.6223"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://www.swissarmy.com/us/en/Products/Swiss-Army-Knives/Small-Pocket-Knives/Classic-SD/p/0.6223</a></p>

<p>One day when I was going through TSA airport security, I forgot to take off the kit and leave it at home. To my surprise I was able to get through without a problem, or anyone asking me questions. When looking at the TSA prohibited items (link below for reference) it looks like I am not able to bring it onto the plane. </p>

<p><a href=""https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/prohibited-items"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/prohibited-items</a></p>

<p>Question: Was the Swiss kit with the knife overlooked by the TSA? If not, is it an allowed carry on item?</p>
","<p>Here's what the <a href=""http://www.tsa.gov"">TSA website</a> says for ""small swiss army knife"":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Check Only</strong></p>
  
  <p>In general, you are prohibited from traveling with sharp objects in
  your carry-on baggage; please pack these items in your checked
  baggage. Scissors with blades smaller than 4 inches, small needles
  carried for special medical needs, and other sharp objects that do not
  contain a blade may be placed in carry-on baggage.</p>
  
  <p>Any sharp objects placed in carry-on or checked baggage should be
  properly sheathed or securely wrapped to prevent injury to TSOs and
  baggage handlers.</p>
  
  <p>Even if an item is generally permitted, it may be subject to
  additional screening or not allowed through the checkpoint if it
  triggers an alarm during the screening process, appears to have been
  tampered with, or poses other security concerns. The final decision
  rests with TSA on whether to allow any items on the plane.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it has a knife, it is not an allowed carry-on item. It is likely they either didn't notice or didn't care. The TSA <a href=""http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-tsa-screeners-20150602-story.html"">does not have a stunning track record</a> when it comes to detecting dangerous prohibited items.</p>

<p>The TSA a few years ago did briefly propose allowing small knives, claiming that the new policy would allow them to better focus on bigger threats, but <a href=""http://www.nbcnews.com/business/travel/why-tsa-gave-knives-planes-f6C10292326"">dropped the plan</a> after serious opposition by pilots, cabin crew, and members of Congress.</p>

"Is crime an issue in the US countryside, especially for a cyclist?","18655","","<p>I have a dream of one day cycling from one coast of the USA to the other.</p>

<p>I am aware that cycling on the road can be dangerous, but I've done a lot of it. I know how to stay safe, and I'm not concerned about that.</p>

<p>As a Brit, I'm used to the idea that the countryside is not at all dangerous, that is from a criminal/violent point of view. In this country Dick Turpin and other rural bandits have long since been consigned to history. I have never heard of anyone being mugged or otherwise attacked while walking down a country lane in Hampshire or Glamorgan. Not denying it's possible, just saying that I've never known it to happen.</p>

<p>With America, I am not sure. I get the impression that there are areas of serious deprivation where crime is a problem outside urban areas as well as inside. On the other hand I may have watched too many scary American films, and Breaking Bad.</p>

<p>Cycling along a random country lane in America by myself, am I in danger or not?</p>

<p>Edit: <strong>I have been comprehensively reassured.</strong> You have not only demonstrated that violent criminals aren't a problem, you've demonstrated why as well. What with all the articulateds, trains, hailstones, tornadoes, hurricaines, thunderstorms, blizzards, droughts, earthquakes, bears, wolves, rattlesnakes, dogs, alligators and whatnot, criminals don't hang around  because <strong>they think it's too damned dangerous</strong>.</p>
","<p>I've travelled coast-to-coast in the USA a couple of times, and would say that in rural areas it's pretty much equivalent to the UK.</p>

<p>Both countries have random attacks, but in both countries it's so rare that it shouldn't affect how you conduct yourself, although of course you shouldn't go around deliberately antagonising people.</p>

<p>There may well be some scary places in both countries where you feel conspicuous and threatened as a noticeably wealthy (or wealthier) tourist. Race may play a part in this more than it does in Britain -- for example a white tourist will be very conspicuous in a poor black area in Louisiana.</p>

<p>You'll notice, though, and go elsewhere, before any trouble happens, in daylight hours.</p>

<p>On a random country lane, though -- you'll be lucky to see anyone at all. When you do they're almost certain to be very friendly (and usually very excited to meet someone British -- even if they initially assume you're Australian).</p>

<p>For a Brit in the red states, unless you're significantly to the right of the British political norm, it's a good idea to steer conversation away from certain topics to do with politics, religion and sexuality.</p>

<p>You probably <em>have</em> watched too many scary American films. Watch <em>Eden Lake</em> to even things up :)</p>

"How to get rid of the men who ask for money in Milan?","18630","","<p>The men are mostly located in Duomo Square (Piazza del Duomo). They try to tie something to tourists' wrists and ask for money. I have fallen out with them many times. Also my friends who visit Milan, encounter the same issue.</p>

<p>For the Milan case, what is the best solution to get rid of these men? Is it likely to see any police officer around and do police speak English?</p>
","<p>Answer by a local here.</p>

<p>I work 200 meters from Duomo of Milan, so I find them at the underground exit every morning.</p>

<p>First and foremost, remember that most of the people doing this are pushed by a local ""mafia"" system. Therefore a good amount (from 70 to 80%) of their pay is just thrown away, and they live in a deplorable condition, so if you don't want to give them money, please be gentle anyway.</p>

<p>If you don't want to give money to them, you can put your hands in pockets and go away ignoring them (putting hands in pockets is the main important thing here, as I said before, that I experience this every day).
Just don't in any moment stop to give them an answer, or anything, you'll be ""caught"" in their chats, and you will no longer get rid of them.
Saying GRAZIE, or NO doesn't matter if they have chosen you as their target, so just walk away as if you had something important to do (in Milan walking fast everywhere is pretty standard, you won't be seen as a crazy).</p>

<p>In Duomo there are many police, since the recent terrorist attacks in Europe, so the police sees these men and know they are there, but they don't do anything except if someone goes to them and reports a problem, but they are anyway reluctant to catch them, because they are just the ""last man"" behind a criminal organization and they are basically just trying to survive.</p>

<p>The last sentence, this is mainly a personal one, if you don't want to give money to them, and you'll visit Milan in winter/autumn , and you are ""caught"", offer them to buy a coffee or a cappuccino (from 0.8 to 1.2 € in the nearby McDonalds 50 meters away) and you will be their ""savior"" for all the day; furthermore, you are sure what you'll give them is basically for them, and not for a criminal organization behind.</p>

<p>Enjoy your visit in Milan!</p>

"Can you easily get between Rotterdam Central Station and Rotterdam The Hague Airport by public transport?","18623","","<p>In the past when I've gone to Rotterdam, it has either been by train, or from the <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/13900/best-way-from-central-rotterdam-to-europoort"">port</a>, which we've got <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/17580/other-public-transport-from-rotterdam-central-station-to-europort"">questions covering</a>. This time, having snagged a very good deal, I'll be flying into Rotterdam The Hague Airport, which is a first for me.</p>

<p>Is it easy to get from the airport to near Rotterdam Central Station by public transport, or would it involve walking/changes/taxis/etc.? And if it is possible by public transport, is it for normal local prices, or does it end up requiring <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/12766/why-is-public-transport-from-to-the-airport-so-expensive"">special expensive tickets</a> for the journey?</p>
","<p>As <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/a/18469/26"">Bernhard</a> managed to find, there's information on public transport on the <a href=""http://www.rotterdamthehagueairport.nl/en/Openbaar_vervoer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">airport's website</a> (click the British flag in the top bar if it comes up in Dutch). It's actually even easier than the website makes out!</p>

<p>In the baggage hall, there's a sign up explaining about the two bus options, and with directions to the bus stops. When you exit the terminal, turn left and walk for an epic 20-30 meters, and you'll reach the bus stops. There's one stop for the #50, one for the #33, both well signed. If you have an <a href=""https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/?taal=en"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">OV-chipcard</a>, you can use that for the journey. Otherwise, €3 in cash paid onboard gets your a single ticket valid for 1 hour.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.ret.nl/en/nc/travel-with-ret/timetable/details/bus/lijn-33/heen.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">#33 bus</a> runs direct to Rotterdam Central Station, taking about 25-30 minutes. For the west of the city centre or around the station, that's probably the best bet. Otherwise, the <a href=""http://www.ret.nl/en/nc/travel-with-ret/timetable/details/bus/lijn-50.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">#50</a> bus shuttles you out to the Meijersplein metro station, from which it's easy to take the metro north to The Hague (Den Haag), or south into the city centre. You can use a journey planner like the <a href=""http://www.rome2rio.com/s/Rotterdam-Airport-RTM-Netherlands/Rotterdam"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Rome2Rio one</a> or <a href=""http://www.ret.nl/en/travel-with-ret/travel-planner.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ret.nl</a> to work out which'll be the best for you. Both buses are pretty frequent, every 10-20 minutes depending on the time of day, and you can be at the bus stop in well under 10 minutes from wheels down if you're travelling only with hand luggage only</p>

<p>Depending on how many journeys you plan to take, it might or might not be worth getting an OV-chipkaart. It's currently <a href=""https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/aanvragen/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">€7.50 for one</a>, which reduces the single ticket to the city centre to €1.66, so you'll need to make a few journeys to make it worthwhile. If it's open, you can buy one from the <a href=""http://www.rotterdamthehagueairport.nl/Openbaar_vervoer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ako newsagent</a>, which is between the arrivals and departure areas (turn right outside customs, and it's on your left next to the currency exchange office). However, Ako seems to have much shorter opening hours than many other places in the airport, so take care if arriving very early or late in the day! Otherwise, the people at the information desk just after you exit customs are very helpful, ask them for advice if you need it!</p>

"Can I through check my bags on separate bookings (international flights)?","18574","","<p>I have two different bookings on British Airways and Emirates.</p>

<p>Booking 1 (British Airways):
Washington (IAD) -> London (LHR) -> Dubai</p>

<p>Booking 2 (Emirates):
Dubai -> Hyderabad</p>

<p>I have a 5 hour stop in Dubai but do not have a visa to leave the airport. British Airways says they won't through-check my bags. Emirates says it won't be a problem since Emirates and BA are partner airlines. </p>

<p>Not sure what I should do at this point. My flight is tomorrow so its too late to apply for a visa. I have actually done with before without a problem on the same two airlines. The only difference was that it was on a single ticket booked through a travel website.</p>
","<p>So here is my update on my situation. All in all pretty terrible:</p>

<p>BA refused to check my bags in all the way to Hyderabad (India). They have a policy of not checking bags on flights other than their own. They would make an exception only for OneWorld partners. Something about how BA was responsible for luggage even if the other airline lost it. The fact that I am Sapphire on OneWorld (Platinum on American) did not help. The night before travel I also applied for a last minute visa for Dubai just in case (so I could pick up bags and re-check them in Dubai; I would have enough time there). This visa was rejected by the Visa office in Dubai since it had been less than 30 days since my last visit. They charged $280 for the application which they have decided to keep.</p>

<p>I was left with no choice but pay $630 to change my BA ticket to go to Hyderabad directly since BA would not let me board the flight. </p>

<p>I am disputing the charge with BA who has so far offered to pay for my unused ticket from Dubai to Hyderabad. This only amounts to around $170. </p>

Use caution when making different bookings on non partner airlines especially when you have visa requirements in the place where you transit. </p>

"Cebu Pacific Air flight cancellation/modification fees","18538","","<p>Recently I came across with one problem. I have several domestic flights in the Philippines, but after checking with the ferry's company I cannot make it to one of the legs. So I have 2 options, take a flight later that day, flight from a different island.</p>

<p>So I went to their website cebupacificair.com and looked at the <a href=""http://www.cebupacificair.com/flights-and-fares/fee-summary.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Fees' section</a> because that's the only reference I could check.</p>

<ul>
<li>800PHP for changes</li>
<li>900PHP for cancelations</li>
</ul>

<p>Seems fair, so I tried to change my booking online and I discovered that far from true, the fees were much more expensive.</p>

<p>To change the flight from a different City they charge:</p>

<ul>
<li>800PHP for changing + 900PHP for changing city (That's changing again?) + 600PHP fare difference (The fare was the same)</li>
</ul>

<p>To change the flight from the same city but flying just few hours later
- 800PHP + 1000PHP (I don't know where this came from)</p>

<p>So I decided to cancel the flight and get the refund 2500PHP (The ammount I paid per person) - 900PHP = 1600PHP. That's far from true.. it turns out I have to pay 900PHP they don't talk about refunds ( I checked and the promo fares have no refund, but mine was not promo).. how is that possible? </p>

<p>I cannot see any reason on their website, their call center is just useless and the customer service hanged up the phone every time I called.</p>

<p>Does anyone experience a similiar problem? Also I'm not talking about a single refund 1600PHP (around 23£ or 37$) but we are a group of 15 people.. which now it's a considerable amount of money.</p>
","<p>Sorry, but this kind of stuff is standard for low-cost carriers and is the price you pay for cheap tickets.  Cebu is particularly bad, there was a bit of a flap in Singapore a few years back when Cebu cancelled a bunch of flights and stonewalled passengers who wanted their money back for months on end.</p>

<p>So.  The 800 PHP change fee applies only if you change to another flight <em>at precisely the same fare</em>.  However, since the LCC model is that prices go up as the date approaches, you're never going to see that same fare again and you have to pay a random fare differential in addition to the change fee.</p>

<p>And yes, of course you're being charged an additional 900 PHP to change cities, because there is no such thing as a ""city change"" in the LCC world.  I presume the fare is quoted as the cancellation of the original itinerary plus the booking of an entirely new fare to the new city.</p>

<p>Finally, LCCs often do not allow ""real"" refunds at all, the best they will do is give you credit towards future flights, minus the cancellation fee.  Your story is a little unclear here, and I'm not sure what Cebu's policy is, but it sounds like this is what they are offering you as well.</p>

<p>I wish I had some useful advice for you, but there just isn't all that much you can do.  Keep pestering the call centre, or go to a Cebu office in person if you can, and try to get a clear accounting of how they are calculating those costs and/or refusing to refund.</p>

"Are the hoses in toilets in Asia something I should know about?","18393","","<p>I have noticed random bits of hose without proper fittings before I think for example in India and just assumed they are for use by the cleaners or for filling the water jug in <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/3080/ok-were-all-adults-here-so-really-how-on-earth-should-i-use-a-squat-toilet"">squat toilets</a>.</p>

<p>But Now I'm travelling in Malaysia and Singapore and there are more western toilets than squat toilets in the places I've been yet proper hoses with proper fittings are very common in toilets:<br>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pUCe2.jpg"" alt=""A hose in a toilet in Malaysia""><br>
<sup>(Hose next to a Western style toilet in my hostel in Chinatown, Kuala Lumpur.)</sup></p>

<p>At one place in Singapore there were even signs on each cubicle door stating whether it contained a western or squat toilet, but also whether there was a hose! (I didn't take a photo of the sign, unfortunately)</p>

<p>This makes me think there is a use for the hose for clients, not just cleaners. But for what purpose? Should I know how to use it as a tourist? Please tell me it's not a kind of alternative to a bidet!</p>

<p>Possibly related is the fact that many toilet floors are awash with water. This can be a big problem if you're not wearing waterproof shoes or have to lower your trousers and keep them dry. Other than this toilets are pretty clean and I've seen both the hoses and the wetness in what I would regard as somewhat ""fancy"" places.</p>
","<p>These are used to wash the private areas after using the toilet, it is the upgrade to the jug, so instead of filling a jug and use it to wash you use the hose directly. </p>

<p>To use it, hold it with one hand (the dominant) and press, water stream will wash away things, you also can use the other hand (non-dominant) to clean while aiming the stream to the private areas same way as you do when using the jug.</p>

<p>So, the jug was upgraded to the hose, the hose was upgraded to the bidet (not in Asia), the bidet was upgraded to the toilet seats with built-in water washers (washlet). Anyway, most countries in Asia still use the hose which gives more control over the washing process. It is also used to wash feet and the toilet itself. </p>

Proceed up the Avenue a few blocks and turn left on to any side street. There you will find a somewhat post-apocalyptic venue where migrants have created a camp site.  It's <em>bloody</em> dangerous and borderline foolhardy to stroll around without an escort.</p>

<p>And if that's not adventurous enough, there is an abandoned railway running around the centre of Paris called the '<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemin_de_fer_de_Petite_Ceinture"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Petite Ceinture</a>' (i.e., 'little belt'). Portions of the track path have been claimed for ad-hoc, makeshift migrant camps. These are essentially lawless. </p>

<p>To try it, you can pick up the tracks near the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gare_d%27Orsay"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gare d'Orsay</a> (or really anywhere along the track path).  Walk along the track path towards the Southeastern part of Paris. You'll find tents and mattresses and what-not strewn about and you'll be well satisfied that you have experienced urban danger in Paris. Don't even <em>think</em> about it at night.</p>

<p><a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/users/9009/jonathanreez"">Jonathan Reez</a> asks ""<em>Is it okay to visit that migrant camp if not carrying any valuables?</em>""</p>

<p>Unless you have a sign in about 12 languages that you are not carrying valuables, I wouldn't suggest it.  Your best strategy is to wait until you spot a police patrol on foot and ask if you can join them. Or stay close behind them without permission, but then expect a <strong>sharp</strong> challenge. Are you a trafficker? A pimp? Dealing drugs? Looking for children to kidnap? A serial killer? What are you doing there? <strong>You don't belong!</strong> These questions would by posed to YOU, the visitor, rather than to the inhabitants.  The police would be upset because you are in an <em>unregulated</em> place and they will have to waste time escorting you to safety.</p>

<p>Interestingly, there has been <em>no mention of 'migrant crime' at all in this answer</em>, even through all of its various edits. The answer addresses 'danger'.  Let's turn to an earlier definition put forth on this site where the topic was Russia...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Having said that, if your definition of 'dangerous' includes feeling
  unsafe, or being physically intimidated, or any other source of
  discomfort brought on by the locals, then these things could lead to a
  feeling of being threatened. At the very least the discomfort brought
  on by a perceived threat will spoil your mood, and possibly lead to
  the conclusion that it's dangerous. This can happen without any crime
  being committed, such as a direct physical assault. Physical
  intimidation is also not a crime, but leads to the same feeling of
  threat and being unsafe.</p>

<p>This passage is saying that 'danger' is often a state where the person feels the absence of safety.  ""Crime"" and ""criminality"" can, and often have nothing to do with it. Also, there is nothing in this answer that stereotypes a particular ethnic group. These notions were introduced by <a href=""http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Ouch%20Cube"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">commenters</a>, most likely as a misconceived <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/60260/can-i-enter-and-exit-a-country-immediately/60278#60278"">display of piety</a>.

"Air Asia and Air Asia X on same flight, what's the difference?","18383","","<p>There's a flight from KUL to MEL at night that gets into MEL the following morning.  It comes up (same time, same plane, same everything) in my searches twice, however - as Air Asia, and Air Asia X.  However, the Air Asia one is $2 more than the Air Asia X.</p>

<p><a href=""http://flightaware.com/live/flight/XAX214"" rel=""nofollow"">The flight in question, when it flew a few hours ago</a></p>

<p>Is this just variation in pricing, or is there an actual difference in the tickets? It's on an A330, which implies it's Air Asia X, as according to <a href=""http://www.airasia.com/ask/template.do?id=504"" rel=""nofollow"">their site</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>What is the difference between AirAsia and AirAsiaX?</h2>
  
  <p><strong>AirAsia</strong></p>
  
  <p>Operates flights that are inside 4 hours flight time. AirAsia utilises
  aircraft with single class cabin and seating configuration. AirAsia
  operates Airbus A320 which has a seating capacity of 180 passengers.</p>
  
  <p><strong>AirAsiaX</strong></p>
  
  <p>Operates flights that has more than 4 hours flying time, which is also
  termed as long haul flights. AirAsiaX utilises aircraft with single
  class cabin but with premium and economy class seating. AirAsiaX
  operates Airbus A330 which has a seating capacity of 377 passengers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I'm wondering if it's just a case of Air Asia trying to sell the same tickets, or if there's a difference in the service one would receive (meals etc)?</p>
","<p>Same tickets.  No difference in service.  There is a difference in service between the budget and the flat bed class, but no difference otherwise.</p>

<p>As you point out, the A330 suggests AirAsia X and the fact that it's a flight over 4 hours also suggests that; so it's an AirAsia X flight, whatever they're saying it as.</p>

<p>Judging by the general quality of their website, I'd say it's a bug rather than anything clever like trying to sell more tickets.</p>

"Are there any US laws that a US citizen MUST obey while traveling, even if those laws do not exist in the country he is traveling to?","18375","","<p>It goes without saying that the laws vary from country to country, and what is illegal in one country might be both legally permitted and culturally accepted in another.</p>

"Is it safe to drive the Baja Peninsula?","18272","","<p>I want to drive from Tijuana to Cabo San Lucas but I've heard of people being pulled over by corrupt cops and being hassled by people on the peninsula. I speak fluent Spanish and I'm pretty street smart. Should I be worried?</p>
","<p>The <em>mordida</em> (nibble) is unfortunately deeply ingrained in Mexico, although mostly a feature of local police and not the federal police or the military, and there are various anti-corruption initiatives at work in the larger cities.</p>

<p>Generally, the interaction involves being pulled over for a traffic offense like speeding or not wearing a seat belt. The driver is warned of some exaggerated penalty for some exaggerated offense, then suggested to get the fine reduced for a consideration of a few hundred pesos. There are very few stories, however, of more serious harassment. <strong>A dirty cop is out for cash, not blood</strong>, so a play for time may encourage him to move on to another target.</p>

<p>There are plain vanilla ticket traps all over, as there are in Canada and the U.S., and legitimate checkpoints set up by the military and federal police, so it's good to be aware of local laws (e.g. tinted windows are illegal in Tijuana unless you have proof of manufacturer installation) and to follow the standard tips for dealing with law enforcement in any country:</p>

<ul>
<li>Remain calm and polite; never show outward anger and never become argumentative.</li>
<li>Never <em>offer</em> a bribe. It will genuinely insult honest police, and the dishonest ones know how to work to get one; there's no need to make things easy on them.</li>
</ul>

<p>On federal highways and in the larger cities (Tijuana, Ensenada, etc.) you will have written traffic tickets; elsewhere, however, the officer will take your license and escort you to the police station. Any solicitation for a bribe will take place before you get to the police station, of course, so if you can play for time, the dirty cop will get impatient and let you go. Knowing Spanish helps mainly in that the dirty cop would fear that you know of recourse to the Sindicata or other authority.</p>

<p>If you do go to the station, you will meet the <em>juez calificador</em> (a kind of municipal judge) who will review the charge. If you feel the charge is unfair, you can appeal to the judge. There is a discount on the ticket if you pay early.</p>

<p>If you have been solicited for a bribe, by all means report it to the authorities. The Sindicata (think: Internal Affairs), the local mayor, the governor, and the consul would be a good start.</p>

<p><em>Baja Insider</em> magazine has an interesting 2010 article with some tips on avoiding or minimizing your <em>mordida</em> exposure: 
<a href=""http://www.bajainsider.com/driving-baja/policecorruptionbaja.html"">http://www.bajainsider.com/driving-baja/policecorruptionbaja.html</a></p>

<p>Above all, remember that the greatest risks of driving in Baja California come not from drug cartels, banditos, or corrupt police, but from the road itself. The roads are often narrow, isolated, in disrepair or under construction, or being crossed by cattle or horses, and likely some combination of the above. It is best to stick to the toll roads (which are better maintained and controlled), to drive during daylight hours only, to keep your fuel topped off, and to drive slowly.</p>

"LAX to Anaheim - how much slower is the Super Shuttle than a cab?","18208","","<p>I am flying to LAX and need to get to the Anaheim Hilton (essentially the convention centre). Although it's only 29 miles, I am told it will take 90 minutes and cost $100 by cab. That's quite a cab fare, so I am thinking of the Super Shuttle. Problem is, every time I try the shuttle, it seems we spend 30-45 minutes driving around the airport, and then go to everyone else's hotels (and homes!) first, adding what feels like another hour to the trip.</p>

<p>Since I'll be landing at 10pm California time, which will feel like 1am, I'm really not up for that. But perhaps the freeway part of the journey is the bigger part, and it won't be that bad? Does anyone have experience with cabs, shuttles etc specifically from LAX to Anaheim, and suggestions for which I should choose?</p>
","<p>Some thoughts:</p>

<ul>
<li>That 29 miles sounds like it came from someone in PR—Google maps puts it at <a href=""http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=lax&amp;daddr=Convention+Center,+Anaheim,+CA&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=33.871556,-118.161392&amp;spn=0.549589,0.588455&amp;sll=33.871556,-118.164139&amp;sspn=0.549589,0.588455&amp;geocode=FefvBQIdKTrx-Cm1T7IT0rDCgDHxrYtpV3uodw%3BFfu-AwIdBq34-Cl5B-WI3dfcgDGM5gLSjglTdg&amp;mra=ltm&amp;z=11"">over 35 miles</a> and 60-80 minutes with traffic. Back when I lived there, I'd have estimated that drive at about 90 minutes <em>without</em> traffic.</li>
<li>Do you know what your schedule will be like during the trip? Unless you <em>know</em> you're going no further than a few blocks away from the hotel/convention center during the whole trip, you'll almost always want to rent a car in Southern California. Keep in mind that you can't catch taxis on the street, and public transportation is <em>very</em> limited.</li>
<li>Are you traveling by yourself, or with others? If it's just you, it's hard to justify paying <a href=""http://www.worldtaximeter.com/los-angeles/LAX/Anaheim+Hilton/22-0"">$120 for a cab</a> (each way) versus <a href=""http://www.supershuttle.com/DisneyLandAirportShuttle.htm"">$16 for a shuttle</a> (each way). However, the cab fare is the same no matter how many people they let you cram in.</li>
<li><p>I agree with Joel that John Wayne (SNA) and Long Beach (LGB) are better bets, but it's worth keeping in mind that the shuttle fare is:</p>

<ul>
<li>$16 to/from LAX </li>
<li>$10 to/from SNA</li>
<li>$35 to/from LGB</li>
</ul>

<p>Which makes SNA look like the best bet. I have no idea why LGB is that much more when <a href=""http://www.worldtaximeter.com/los-angeles/LGB/Anaheim+Hilton/22-0"">the cab fare</a> would be under $70.</p></li>

"How to stay in Thailand for more than 30 days?","18142","","<p>Thailand imposes a 30-day limit on stays for U.S. citizens travelling on a tourist visa. What is the preferred way to stay up to three months? So far, I've come up with these options:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Fly to Singapore or another nearby destination; upon return, obtain another 30-day visa (for overland travel, I would only get another 14-day visa).</p></li>
<li><p>Obtain a longer term visa (quite pricey and lots of paperwork)</p></li>
</ol>
","<p>The options are:</p>

<p><strong>Tourist visa in your home country (1-3 entries, 60+30 days on each entry)</strong></p>

<p>Documentation is not particularly difficult. Exact requirements vary depending on the consulate, but usually it's a 1-page application form, two photos, copy of confirmed flight itinerary and a recent bank statement showing some minimal balance ($1500 or so). Visa fee is $35 per entry (plus postage both ways if applying by mail). </p>

<p>Applying by mail is possible in most countries, allow at least 2 weeks turnaround time. The disadvantage is a small chance that your passport may get misplaced.</p>

<p>Applying in person normally involves two visits, one to turn in the documents, and then next day to pick up the visa. The consulates are closed on Thai and US holidays. In large countries (USA, UK, Germany) there are several honorary consulates which tend to be less fussy and far more polite than the Thai Embassy in DC or large consulates (LA, NYC, Chicago). However, they may be hard to find and have limited hours.</p>

<p>An advantage of applying before the trip in your home country is that you can ask for a 2 or 3-entry tourist visa, which gives you a longer stay. Consulates in SE Asia generally issue only single-entry visas. </p>

<p>Allowed stay is <em>60 days per entry</em>. A one-time <em>30-day extension</em> stamp can be obtained at an immigration office within Thailand (takes ~3-6h, 1900 baht). </p>

<p><strong>Visa-free entry by air (30 days)</strong></p>

<p>To extend, fly to one of the neighboring countries and come back (there are many low-cost airlines, like AirAsia). You can also exit Thailand by land and fly back one-way.</p>

<p>Technically, Thai immigration (or the airline) may ask you to show an air ticket back to your home country within the 30 days and proof of funds, but this is rarely enforced, especially if you look clean-cut.</p>

<p><strong>Visa-free entry by land (15 days)</strong></p>

<p>Entering Thailand through any land border crossing (most often to Cambodia or Laos) allows you to stay for only 15 days. </p>

<p>A visa-run (crossing the closest border and coming back to Thailand immediately) is often used. There are tour companies which facilitate this (usually to Poipet, Cambodia as this is closest to Bangkok). </p>

<p>Laos and Cambodia charge for visas at the border ($20-$40). Therefore, a visa-run by a low-cost airline to a place which does not charge (e.g. Singapore or Malaysia) for a 30-day entry may not be more expensive than two 15-day visa-runs by land.</p>

<p><strong>Tourist visa in SE Asia (60+30 days)</strong></p>

<p>Thai consulates in SE Asia issue single-entry tourist visas to foreigners, allowing a <strong>60 day stay</strong> and 30 day extension. Documentation requirements tend to be minimal (less than in your home country). Most commonly used ones are in <strong>Penang, Malaysia</strong> and <strong>Vientiane, Laos</strong> (latter can be easily reached by land, 8hr by bus from Bangkok). Usually the service is next-day. Relatively affordable and reliable agents can be used to avoid standing in lines. </p>

<p>Some consulates (Rangoon, Hong Kong, HCMC) are known to be restrictive, check before going.</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>30-day by air / 15 days by land policy applies to most Western passports (e.g. USA, UK, France, Germany). <strong>For specific details that apply to your nationality, check the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_policy_of_Thailand"">requirements by nationality</a></strong>. Some countries (e.g. Brazil, Korea), get 90 days visa-free either by land or air.</li>
<li>Rules change often, above is valid as of <strong>October 2011</strong>. </li>
<li>Visa requirements and fees can vary at different consulates (even within the same country). Thai consulate websites are often out-of-date.</li>
<li>Visa validity date indicates the last allowed <strong>entry date</strong>, not to allowed duration of stay. For example, a tourist visa valid until 2011-12-31 means that this is the last day you'll be allowed to enter Thailand. Duration of stay is determined by the entry stamp (60-days normally, double-check after immigration). </li>

"Which transportation is best from Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport to Hua Hin?","18106","","<p>What is the most cost effective way to get from the Suvarnabhumi Airport to Hua Hin (on Thailand's northwestern Gulf coast)? And how much would that be compared to a taxi ride?</p>
","<p>A taxi ride would be at least 3000 Baht, but from the Airport you have taxi stands with fixed prices for most destination. From downtown Bangkok, you can negotiate to as low as 2000 Baht. </p>

<p>The less expensive would be to take the public minibuses. Thais use them for transport between provinces. Most of the minibuses can be catched at Victory Monument. To go there from the Airport either take a taxi (about 200 baht), or take the Airport Link to Phaya Thai. There are one rapid (100 baht I think) and one that stops to every station.

"What is a Seaman's book, and can it really replace a passport?","18045","","<p>What is a ""Seaman's book"", and can it really replace a passport for some or all immigration purposes?  Even Wikipedia the all-knowing does not seem to know, although it contains many tantalizing references.</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_immigration_enforcement"">UK immigration enforcement</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Seaman deserters may not have a passport but rather hold a Seaman's Book, (a national identity document issued to professional seamen that contains a record of their rank and service career).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_policy_of_Hong_Kong"">Visa policy of Hong Kong</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Possession of one of the following documents is sufficient to demonstrate [right to abode] ...</p>
  
  <ol start=""6"">
  <li>Hong Kong Seaman's Identity Book</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
","<p>The 'Seaman's Book' provides a travel document that can be used instead of a passport <em>in some cases</em>.  In order to be used as a passport, the situation must be appropriate (i.e., joining or leaving a vessel) and the book itself must contain all of the information that a passport would normally contain.</p>

<p>But the big selling point of having a Seaman's Book, comes when it is presented by a person who would ordinarily require a visa to enter the country.  If the seaman can show that he is joining or leaving a vessel then the border official can waive the visa requirement.</p>

<p>Example: A Nigerian national with a Seaman's Book is joining a vessel currently anchored in Marseille and due to sail somewhere else.  He can present his Nigerian passport along with his Seaman's Book and enter the zone without having to get a Schengen visa.</p>

<p>This will work in every country that is a signatory to the  <a href=""http://www.ilo.org/global/standards/subjects-covered-by-international-labour-standards/seafarers/lang--en/index.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention 108</a> (and in limited circumstances <a href=""http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_ILO_CODE:C185"" rel=""noreferrer"">ILO No. 185</a>).

"Is tap water in Ireland and England drinkable?","18003","","<p>I would like to ask if the tap water in hostels of Ireland and England is drinkable.
I never saw someone drink from there, and even in the pubs you have to order for a bottle.</p>
","<p>When I moved to London for a few years, almost all my friends had filters.  The trace calcium / limescale in the water will result in some people telling you it's ""hard"" water, or ""soft water"" depending on where in the UK you are.</p>

"Are there any techniques, tricks, or tactics to avoid a one-way fee when renting a car?","17978","","<p>Very often, when renting a car and dropping it off at a different location than where you picked it up, you have to pay a huge one-way fee.</p>

<p>Have you successfully used any technique, trick, or tactic to avoid paying such a one-way fee?</p>
","<p>You didn't specify a locale, but within the United States, the answer depends a bit on when and where you are picking the car up and when and where you are dropping it off.</p>

<h2>Shopping around</h2>

<p>The obvious first step is to search as broadly as possible and to be as flexible as possible. Compare rates at Kayak, VroomVroomVroom, and other comparison sites.</p>

<h2>Planning the trip</h2>

<p>Sometimes, the length of the trip factors into the calculation. A few years ago, I rented a car in Binghamton, NY and drove up to Watertown for a 3-day trip. I then needed to drive to Washington, DC and was quoted something exhorbitant for the 4-day, 1-way rental. After talking with the agent over the phone, however, I ""returned"" the car to Binghamton on the way down and made a second rental— in fact, the identical vehicle; I never even took out my bags. In other words, instead of a 4-day 1-way trip, it was a 3-day return and a 1-day 1-way trip, and that saved me almost a third. Yet I have also heard anecdotally of the reverse, where a 2-day 1-way gets a $300 surcharge and the 3-day 1-way does not.</p>

<p>Enterprise and perhaps some other agencies only charge the one-way fee if the drop-off location is more than 500 miles from the pickup location. In still other cases, you may be exempt if renting from corporate-owned locations but not from franchises. You will need to do some research on your own whether the cost advantages of renting from a neighborhood location (namely avoiding airport surcharges and taxes) outweigh the disadvantage of paying the one-way charge.</p>

<h2>One-way specials</h2>

<p>The major rental agencies offer one-way deals as they try to redistribute cars around the country to meet demand. In particular, cars accumulate in warm-weather states in the winter, so in the springtime you'll often find huge discounts if you pick up in Florida or Arizona and drop off in the Northeast or Midwest (Hertz for several years has offered $5/day to take a compact from Arizona and drop it off in California, Colorado, or a few other states). Check the specials pages on their websites. Note that the deal usually applies to only certain types of vehicles and to certain locations, mostly airport locations in major cities.</p>

<p>For Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the US, try searching on auto relocation agency sites like iMoova and TransferCar for current offerings.</p>

<p>Some agencies may not charge a one-way fee if the travel is between airport locations entirely within a few large states, such as California or Florida, where there is a healthy circulation of vehicles.</p>

<p>You are less likely to find such deals from neighborhood locations or from smaller agencies, because they have smaller fleets with higher utilization and are thus less ""liquid"" with their cars.</p>

<h2>Fee-free rate codes</h2>

<p>Some contract rates or coupons waive the drop-off fee, as various organizations negotiate special rates on behalf of their sales staff or other traveling employees. You can find many lists of such rate and coupon codes on the Internet; however, you may be asked to demonstrate that you qualify for the particular rate, and in some cases, you must present a physical coupon.</p>

<h2>Driveaways</h2>

<p>A driveaway is not a traditional rental car; instead, you are transporting a car on behalf of its owner from one location to another. In essence, you are a delivery service. Companies like <a href=""http://www.autodriveaway.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">AutoDriveaway</a> can help set you up with a car. As might be expected, however, there are significant differences from a traditional rental car. On the one hand, you may get a newer, cleaner, or fancier car, as well as save a lot of money. On the other hand, you will face a high deposit, time and mileage limits, and restrictions such as no eating, no nighttime driving, or no using the trunk. </p>

<p>Finally, in some cases there is simply no possibility. I know of no agency that will be happy if you rent from Fairbanks, Alaska and return to Seattle, because there are so few cars that will be dropped off in Fairbanks. Specialty cars (sports cars, convertibles, etc.) also tend to be excluded from deals, because they do not circulate as freely and because their patrons are less price-sensitive.</p>

<p>International rentals are also tricky. I know anecdotally that trying to rent a car in Western Europe and return it in Eastern Europe is a daunting prospect. Laws can trip you up; for example, Canadians cannot drive a U.S.-registered rental over the border due to import laws (although they can rent a Canadian-registered vehicle in the U.S. and drive it cross-border). </p>

"When traveling to a country with a different currency, how should you take your money?","17954","","<p>Recently my wife and I traveled to Italy and before we left we got about 85% of our money in travelers checks and the other 15% we carried on in cash. When we arrived there, no one would take our travelers checks and many places did not accept credit cards. Eventually, we found some currency exchange places that would take the travelers checks and give us Euro's, but at a 7-15% fee, which was not really a very fun surprise. </p>

<p>While I was under the impression that it is safer to use travelers checks, it seems that they were not really accepted (the usual explanation being fraud). So the question is, is it best to just exchange your currency at home and carry all of it with you when you travel or are there other alternatives to carrying cash that are safer and cost effective?</p>
","<p>I think the current usual solution is to get a debit card (or failing that a credit card) with low/no foreign transaction and cash withdrawl fees. (In the UK, the Halifax Clarity Card is the best for this at the moment)</p>

<p>Then, when you get to the country, take out cash periodically. Not too much in case of issues, but don't assume you can do it too often as you may not always be able to find a cash machine depending on where you are.</p>

<p>It's worth getting a little bit of currency before you go (if you don't have it left over from another trip), so you can buy a coffee while you wait for everyone who got off the plane quicker than you to finish using the cash machine at the port/airport/station!</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Since you've said you're in the US, I can't suggest the best card for you to get to avoid/minimise foreign transaction fees, but asking on the <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/"">personal finance SE site</a> is likely the best bet for finding out what that card is.</p>

"What does the ""sequence number"" on an airplane boarding pass signify?","17925","","<p>Inspired by <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/q/67879/108"">this question</a>: what does the ""sequence number"" on an airplane boarding pass signify?</p>
","<p>It's the order in which you checked in to the flight segment. The first person to check in will get seq 001, onwards up to the last person who checks in.</p>

<p>That does not make it the same as the order in which you obtained your boarding pass, although in most circumstances you would receive a boarding pass at the same time as you check in.</p>

<p>If you obtain another boarding pass it will have the same sequence number (unless for some reason you were offloaded from the flight in the mean time), even if printed by another airline.</p>

<p>Some people competitively attempt to obtain sequence number 001. I suppose everyone needs to have a hobby. [In some cases it is relevant, for instance for a while British Airways prioritized upgrades by whoever checked in first (amongst other considerations), and United Airlines uses it as a tie-breaker if two people have otherwise equivalent precedence for an automatic upgrade.]</p>

<p>I'm not looking for things in Valencia proper (suggestions are still very welcome, but it's a lot easier to google for those), but places easily accessible from Valencia by train/bus/etc.  The time of visit is December, approx. 1 week.</p>

<p>Examples of what we find interesting (I'm only including this as a rough guideline for people who answer, as I'd expect question about this): seeing local life, possibly villages, I liked the zoo in other cities, <em>easy</em> hiking (as I'm not alone), local food.  Examples of what I don't find interesting: nightlife.</p>

<p>Currently I have the choice between staying 3.5 or 6.5 days, I'd lean for 7 if I can find some things to see outside Valencia too.</p>
","<p>Ok then, some suggestions, as I've been to Valencia a couple of times.</p>

<p>West of Valencia is Requena, a fantastic little Spanish town.<br>
The night before La Tomatina is the festival of water and wine, but as you're going in December, you can just enjoy the town itself.<br>
It used to be a Moorish fortress, and parts of the town date from the 13th century. All sorts of random little streets and twists and turns.</p>

<p>Closer, but still west of Valencia again is Buñol, where La Tomatina occurs. Again, nice town to walk around and explore, cool squares to sit with a coffee and soak it up.<br>
I spent several hours walking around here trying to find anyone who would let us use a phone, after being pickpocketed at La Tomatina, so I know it well.<br>
At least if you go in December there won't be passed-out Aussies everywhere ;)</p>

<p>90km north of Valencia are some hot springs.  I wanted to go, but found it really difficult to get information on them, and didn't have much time anyway. But they sounded incredible.</p>

<p>Finally, and I know this is vague and really unlike me as normally place names are easy, but there's a Unesco heritage site - a castle fort village place on a hill.  It's SPECTACULAR.  But for the life of me I can't remember the name.  It's 2 hours by car from Valencia.<br>
My searching has revealed <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_of_J%C3%A1tiva"" rel=""nofollow"">Xàtiva</a> which seems to pretty much match it and looks amazing, but <a href=""http://www.360cities.net/image/castle-of-xativa-valencia-spain#-178.35,21.01,67.8"" rel=""nofollow"">the images</a> don't jog any memories currently.

<p>Ok, after finding <a href=""http://beer-travels.com/index.php?ac=05&amp;entry=10"" rel=""nofollow"">this blog</a> I'm now a little more convinced that it may well be the right castle.</p>

<p>Also, and I know you didn't request it, but in Valencia, go see the Holy Grail, and the new area of Valencia is spectacular and well worth a walk.  You can also go down to the docks and see the America's Cup Village with all the companies that compete - Team New Zealand, Oracle and the like.</p>

"Do you have a GPS signal on board of a plane?","17817","","<p>Does anybody know if there is a GPS signal available on board of a plane with a common and normal GPS receiver?</p>
","<p>Unfortunately the plane body does an excellent job of blocking GPS signal.  In general if you're in a window seat you will be able to get a signal by holding the GPS near the window (or, for example, on a tray table) - but if you're elsewhere on the plane it's very unlikely you'll get a signal.</p>

<p>The exception to this may be the new Boeing 787, which is made primarily of Carbon-fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP). Not only does CFRP allow for larger windows (which would allow a greater visibility of the sky, and thus more GPS satellites), but it's likely that the GPS signal would pass through the aircraft shell better than on conventional planes.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that not all airlines allow passengers to use GPS receivers in flight (they are technically ""radio receivers"" which are often not allowed).  Be sure to check with the specific airline and/or the flight crew to confirm that you are allowed use one.</p>

</ul>

<p>Why is that? I first thought it's an easy way of implementing a size/weight limit. However, personal experience shows me that even when you are allowed to bring a backpack that is small enough to be carried on one shoulder, you <em>have to</em> wear it on one shoulder the all the time.</p>

<p>One possible reason is given <a href=""https://community.ricksteves.com/travel-forum/to-the-west/backpacks-in-paris-museums"">here</a>, but it's not very convincing to me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Packs on the back are risks for the art. People turn around quickly and knock statues or scratch paintings with the packs when worn on two shoulders across the back.</p>

","<p>Because if your bag is large enough to be only carried on your back (i.e. you cannot carry it on one shoulder), you'll much more likely to bump into, and do some damage to objects/sculptures/other people while turning around. This is because you don't see your bag, and it is much harder to estimate how big it is when maneuvering. It is much less likely when your bag is on your side, as you can see it.</p>

<p>Also with a large back on your back you're taking up to twice more space, which may be a problem near crowded exhibitions.</p>

","<p>Yes. It is usually required that you fly all legs of a single ticket. Even if you skip the last leg, the airline might penalise you later. At the very least, you should contact the airline before the flight and tell them that for unforeseen reasons you need to skip one leg; in this case, they <em>might</em> not cancel the remainder.</p>

<p>Of course, in every particular case it depends on the fine print of your ticket. As Burhan Khalid points out, this probably just refers you to the policy of the carrier, for example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The General Terms and Conditions of Carriage of [airline] apply. They are to be found on [airline's website] and can be provided at all [airline] ticket counters.</p>

<p>I've used Airbnb in the past, but for such a long stay it's too expensive. In the US I would check Craigslist, but it doesn't seem like a popular site in Berlin.</p>

<p>Alternatively, are there any services in Berlin that I could pay for help finding an apartment?</p>
","<p>I've done this several times, renting a flat in Berlin for some weeks up to about a month. Over the years, my platforms of choice have been <a href=""http://www.wg-gesucht.de/"" rel=""nofollow"">wg-gesucht.de</a> and <a href=""http://zwischenmiete.de"" rel=""nofollow"">zwischenmiete.de</a>. The first one of those had more offers than the second one when I last used it in December 2012. A lot of offers were available on both platforms.</p>

<p>On these platforms you find apartments or rooms by people who are away for some time. For example there are students studying abroad for a semester, and they decide it's better to sublet their place for <em>some</em> money than leave it empty. You can get pretty good deals if you are lucky.</p>

<p>I recommend getting in contact with people by phone. Also, often it's not worth considering offers older than three days, but you never know.</p>

<p>The full price is usually composed of:</p>

<pre><code>  base rent
+ utility costs (normally fixed)
+ deposit (normally up to a month base rent)

"How to avoid hotels with bellhops in the USA","17604","","<p>Many guides to tipping in the USA include a specification to tip a ""bellhop"" at a hotel, which is apparently an employee who expects to be paid separately for the ""service"" of accompanying the guest from the reception to their room.</p>

<p>The times I have been to America, there has been no such person -- the hotels I stayed at just followed the straightforward standard procedure of <em>""here's your keycard; your room is number XYZ on the Xth floor, and the elevators are over there -- enjoy your stay""</em>. But it's possible that I've simply been lucky with the hotels I selected.</p>

<p>When booking a hotel stay online in the USA, is there something in particular one should look for to be sure it's not a place where one will be hit with hidden costs for ""bellhop"" services?</p>

<p>(Or is it perhaps all a myth intended to scare travelers? When I arrive at a hotel I'll generally have been able to lug my baggage through airports and across a city all by myself, and it seems somewhat incongruous that a hotel would expect me to relinquish control of it for the last few meters between the reception and my room, and pay for the indignity to boot!)</p>
","<p><strong>You don't need to worry about this. Bellhops are always optional.</strong></p>

<p>Usually when you check in at a place with bellhops, (and they really only exist in higher end hotels), a bellhop will approach you and say ""Can I carry your bags?"". You just say ""No thanks, we'll be fine.""</p>

<p>Sometimes the bellhop will carry the bags anyway, or the receptionist will sumon the bellhop without asking.. Even then you can decline the service. Just say ""We'll carry our bags ourselves, thanks"". Whatever happens, f they carry your bags without you asking <strong>you are completely entitled to not tip.</strong> You didn't ask for the service, and you have no obligation to pay for it.</p>

<p>Actually you are always entitled to not tip. Tips are always optional, and if you don't want to tip, for any reason, that's entirely up to you. The situation where a bellhop stands around holding out his hand and looking at you pointedly happens only in movies.</p>

<p>As a final note, bellhops are almost certainly paid less than minimum wage, and may not be paid at all. </p>

"Miles & More: What is a booking class?","17562","","<p>I'm member of the frequent flyer program Miles &amp; More. Now I wanted to request additional miles for a flight during summer 2011 when I wasn't yet a member. To fill out the online form, I have to enter the booking class. There are various possibilities, for example Economy B class, Economy C class, Economy D class, etc.</p>

<p>I don't know what this is. I flew economy class, but I didn't know that there are any subclasses. So how can I find the right booking class? The flight was from Zürich to Helsinki with blue1.</p>
","<p>The booking class is the basis for the fare you paid. </p>

<p>Within the 'economy' ticket section, there are different fare ""classes"", A, B, C, D, etc, that have different price levels and a certain number of tickets allocated. Different fare classes can also affect what types of rights you have - like if it's refundable or changeable.</p>

<p>So you could have 20 tickets in class D at €100, 30 tickets in class C at €150, and so on. But perhaps also buying class C means that you're allowed to change the date of your ticket. </p>

<p>Additionally, some types of booking class are ineligible to earn miles, generally the very cheapest.</p>

<p>The pricing for tickets is not alphabetically ordered. For most airlines F means full-fare first class, Y means full-fare economy or economy plus/extra, and C or J can be full-fare business. </p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://www.thaiairways.com/frequent-flyer/en/airlines-booking-class-codes-chart.htm"">this list</a>, the Blue1 booking classes: G/K/L/O/T/U/W are not eligible for miles.</p>

<p>If you order online you should have received an email confirmation with an invoice/receipt that states your booking class somewhere and the level of refunds/changes you can receive. I'd check your booking confirmation first.</p>

<li>PAN Card</li>

<li>UDID (Aadhar) Card</li>
<li>Driving Licence</li>

<p>these all documents having correct birthdate except LC, so in all <em>educational</em> documents contains incorrect (wrong) date. </p>

<p>Now he get chance to visit to US, so he applied for passport where his application got rejected on basic of difference of dates on the LC and other (above) documents. </p>

<p>He tried for,</p>

<ul>
<li>Affidavit (but he couldn't find a proper affidavit source for this, there's one available on <a href=""http://passportindia.gov.in/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://passportindia.gov.in/</a> is <a href=""http://passportindia.gov.in/AppOnlineProject/pdf/AnnexureA.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> but that's for illiterate person - and he's not a illiterate person.)</li>

","<p>Submitting educational certificates is not essential for getting a passport.

<p>However, I will recommend that your friend should contact the school and board to try and get the certificated corrected. You may be able to get the passport now, but this discrepancy will keep creating problems. Also, contact a good notary or lawyer to get an affidavit made which will be useful while you are working on getting the educational certificates re-issued with correct birth date.</p>

"Baggage allowance of separate domestic flights with a connecting international flight?","17511","","<p>In the US, is there such a rule so that, if you are taking a domestic flight and then taking an international flight, the luggage allowance of the international flight will apply? Because it is quite possible you are taking a flight from a small airport to a big airport, and then catch your international flight.</p>

<p>Do all Airlines have the same regulations? Is there such a rule imposed by the government?</p>
","<p>Several years ago IATA (International Air Transport Association) recognized that baggage charges on tickets which multiple carriers were a mess. For example, if you were flying a domestic flight on one airline followed by an international flight with a different airline then there was little consistency around how you would be charged for checked bags - especially if the airlines had different ""free"" baggage allowances.</p>

<p>In order to resolve this problem, IATA passed Resolution 302 which sets the rules for how baggage allowances and charges should be applied on multi-airline itineraries. The rules in Resolution 302 are not simple, and they are not intended to be used directly by humans at check-in counters - but instead are intended to be built into the booking/check-in systems of airlines so that the correct price can be calculated by the system.</p>

<p>Google will find no end of references on <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=IATA%20Resolution%20302"">Resolution 302</a> for you, but in short it states that the baggage rules of the ""Most Significant Carrier"" (MSC) apply. To work out the ""MSC"" for a flight you need to understand how IATA ""regions"" work, but for a simple case like an domestic flight followed by an international flight (or vica versa) the baggage rules/fees of the carrier operating the international flight will apply.</p>

<p>Do not confuse which airlines rules/fees apply with who will actually charge you those fees.  If you are flying a domestic flight on one airline followed by an international flight with another, then the international carriers rates will apply - but they will be charged by the first airline you fly - ie, the domestic carrier.</p>

<p>The implementation of this resolution by carriers is still patchy. Although most (all?) larger airlines have implemented the rules, many smaller/regional carriers have not.  There are also issues introduced when non-standard rules apply to a passenger, such as when you have status on an airline which results in free baggage (especially for a flight other than the first) where the systems are not necessarily capable of correctly calculating the fees.</p>

<p>My question is this: Is it customary to tip for room service in addition to the service and delivery fee? Or are these fees a form of mandatory tip? For anyone who has worked in room service, does any of the service or delivery fee go to the kitchen staff/delivery person?</p>
","<p>In general if there is a ""Service Fee"", then this is the same thing as a tip.  This is not the same as a ""Room Service Fee"", which is NOT the same as a tip.</p>

<p>Generally a ""service fee"" will be a percentage of the total, normally around 15-20%, whereas the ""Room Service Fee"" (sometimes referred to as a plate fee, a tray fee, delivery fee or something similar) is normally a fixed fee in the $3-6 range.</p>

<p>Frequently the room service menu will actually describe the various fees, and will include details such as that the service fee is ""distributed to the staff"", or similar - which is your indication that it is a tip.</p>

<p>How thick of a sweater do I need? How much clothing should I always be wearing to keep myself warm when in outdoors during this period?</p>
","<p>I would suggest a thin jacket to protect you from cold wind and a thin sweater that you can put over whatever you are wearing. Both together should protect you enough. The temperature might drop end of December/January some more so the later you come the colder it gets, sometimes down to 8 degrees. Right now it's 25 for example.</p>

<p>What I have to tell you however is that you will never get a good answer to that. I know people from South India who wear woolen hats and winter jackets when it's below 30 degrees. And I see enough people in Hong Kong that wear shorts &amp; t-shirts when it's 10 degrees in Hong Kong. So you will have to make your own decisions. </p>

<p>It also highly matters where you are going, what you do and where you stay. Feeling cold is not a matter of being outside in Hong Kong. Homes and offices are usually colder than hotels and restaurants. Homes have often very thin windows and few have heaters and offices have maybe good insulated windows but a central aircon that cannot heat and will blow cool air the whole day. That makes them colder than outside in cases. I know enough people who walk around in thick jackets in the office and sometimes at home during the days where it's below 15 degrees.</p>

Or are the terms just as synonymous as <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/9480/whats-the-difference-between-embassies-and-consulates"">Consulates and Embassies</a>? </p>
","<p>They are different. The reason people use the terms interchangeably is that at many border crossings (especially at airports) one set of people handle both.</p>

<p>Customs is about the stuff you are bringing into the country. Is it allowed, should you pay duty, should it be confiscated and burned, etc. By default, none of your stuff is allowed in, even if you're a citizen returning home.</p>

<p>Immigration is about a person who is visiting, immigrating, or returning home. By default visitors are (technically) turned away unless they have a good reason and meet other criteria (for example visitors to Canada may be turned away if they have a criminal record) and those who live here are let in. Immigrants are let in if the paperwork they've done in advance is all correct.</p>

<p>Both processes involve ""who are you, where are you coming from, why are you coming here, why were you there"" and so on. Both involve a uniformed person, your passport, and probably your baggage. For example if you say you are visiting for 3 days, but you have brought weeks worth of clothing - probably all you own - along with more permanent possessions like books, photo albums, and CDs, an immigration officer may suspect you are moving here. Customs officers may want to inspect your baggage for contraband, and your explanation for your visit may make the difference between being inspected or not. As a result they are considered a single process in most people's minds.</p>

<p>To add to the complication, many airlines won't let you board unless you convince them you will be let in at your destination, and some airports (especially in Europe) want to look at your passport and other immigration-related documentation several times before you get to the boarding gate. None of this counts as ""clearing customs and immigration"" but it may sure feel like it.</p>

<p>From the <a href=""http://travel.state.gov/passport/ppi/info/info_870.html"">US State Department Website</a> last sentence.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A federal or state law enforcement agency may request the denial of a passport on several regulatory grounds under 22 CFR 51.70 and 51.72. The principal law enforcement reasons for passport denial are a federal warrant of arrest, a federal or state criminal court order, a condition of parole or probation forbidding departure from the United States (or the jurisdiction of the court), or a request for extradition. The HHS child support database and the Marshals Service WIN database are checked automatically for entitlement to a passport. Denial or revocation of a passport does not prevent the use of outstanding valid passports.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if you have a passport that is valid.  Until you're in the country that shares information with country revoking the passport and chooses to comply with this revocation the only country you're not going to be able to enter would be the country issuing the passport.</p>

"Is there a way to prevent ""looking like a tourist"" in order to not be harassed?","17164","","<p><strong>Disclaimer - the title of this post is probably not the best</strong></p>

<p>On my way to visit family in Belarus and Poland, I had a long layover in Paris, so I decided to spend the day in the city. My luggage was taken care of, and I only had a backpack with my laptop in it.</p>

<p>I'd like to think I dress pretty 'normally'; khaki pants, a slim fitting jacket, and some brown leather boots. I walked alone and quietly, trying to blend in. Yet, I was <em>continually</em> harassed by guys on the street trying to pull a scam of some sort in which they would bend over, pick up some cheap ""golden"" ring, offer it to me as my ""lucky day"", and then ask if I could give them some money for it. [I kept one, and threw it on the ground next to the next guy who tried, before using some expletives.. :-)]</p>

<p>Perhaps this happens to French citizens, too, but they <em>immediately</em> spoke to me in English. I would really like to go back to Paris, but the number of times I was approached and asked for money (the ring guys were just part of it) was an incredible turn-off.</p>

<p>Perhaps I'm thinking too narrowly, but I can only imagine I was doing something to draw attention to myself. Is ""looking like a foreigner"" just something everyone has to deal with, or is there something I can do to prevent being approached besides walking around with psychotic eyes?</p>
","<p>First there's the obvious - when in a tourist area, don't act too much like a tourist. When I lived in London you could instantly tell the locals from tourists in busy tourist areas, regardless of their looks, from the fact the locals were <strong>walking quickly and purposefully</strong> and skirting around the crowds (even when lost) while the tourists had more random, brownian motion.</p>

<p>That doesn't mean you can't enjoy tourist spots without looking like a tourist. For example, you can walk purposefully towards a clear space, glance at your phone or watch while standing like a local who is waiting to meet someone (see below), <em>then</em> admire the view at your leisure.</p>

<hr>

<p>Here's some further tips If you are on a trip where blending in is a priority and you want to go the extra mile, for example, to avoid scams and/or ease natural conversations with locals. </p>

<p>There was a section in <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18085519-fluent-in-3-months"">Benny Lewis's book Fluent In Three Months</a> about this. He described spending time working on mastering the art of blending in so that local people would be more likely to talk to him in their own language in a natural way (he added that getting harassed less for tourist scams was a nice by-product).</p>

<p>This is what I remember of the advice, plus some of my own experience:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pay a lot of attention to body language and posture.</strong> He'd make a point of noticing ways in which in each country other young males his age tended to stand slightly differently, lean slightly differently, walk slightly differently, even wait in different areas of the street to where he would automatically choose to stand. People pick up on these subtle things unconsciously. If people your age and gender idle with loose shoulders and hands in pockets, do the same; if they walk purposefully while slightly swinging their arms, do the same. Also consider things like, what people's default facial expressions are - if you're the only person walking down the street with a broad grin or a look of concentration, you'll stand out. Parisians, for example, have a very a different default expression to Americans.</li>
<li><strong>Get the greetings right, in <em>how</em> you speak and respond as much as <em>what</em> you say.</strong> Part of this is simply responding confidently and not nervously. Also observe how people respond to greetings, questions from strangers, etc. If the norm is to respond to strangers with the local word for ""Yes?"" coupled with raised eyebrow that says ""and why should I give you my time"", and you respond with the local word for ""Hi!"" and a cheesy smile that says ""Have a nice day!™"", you instantly stand out as an ""other"" and scammers are likely to smell an opportunity. This is an important one for harassment - I remember when I was in Egypt, hawkers gave up much faster after I figured out how to say ""No"" the way grumpy/impatient ex-pats did it, instead of how baffled/nervous tourists did it.</li>
<li><strong>Pay attention to the little details in how people dress.</strong> [<em>this one is more for longer trips</em>] What kind of combinations and how people wear things as well as what people wear. I think Benny Lewis used an example of Egypt, where at first glance he thought he fitted in as the locals wore what he considered similar casual wear to himself, but then he noticed certain patterns like, their trousers tended to be smart, fitted jeans in contrast with his scruffier, baggier, lighter options, their t-shirts were tight-fitting with mostly branded designs as opposed to the plainer, looser ones he wore, their shoes were smart and (somehow) immaculately clean in contrast with his grubby trainers, their belts were usually visible and smart-looking, etc etc. When he figured out how to wear casual clothes like an Egyptian, people unconsciously responded differently to him, <em>despite</em> the obvious racial difference (no-one thought he was <em>actually</em> Egyptian, but people unconsciously acted more like they would with other locals, and were more relaxed and natural with him).</li>
</ul>

<p>With a bit of practice, it's possible to tune in to this sort of thing almost unconsciously, and remarkably quickly (like, a few hours; maybe plus one shopping trip at a local market if you really want to go the whole hog).</p>

<p>Of course, this all takes some effort - don't obsess about it so much you enjoy your trip less. When reducing harassment and easing conversations with locals <em>aren't</em> an issue or a priority on a particular trip - for example, if you're somewhere super-touristy and there's no point pretending - there's no reason not to relax and just enjoy being a tourist.</p>

"Is there a flight search engine that combines flights from different airlines?","17162","","<p>Is there a search engine that considers ""mix&amp;match"" flight combinations?</p>

<p>My current problem: I need to go from FRA to YLW (Frankfurt/Germany to Kelowna/Canada) on July 29th, and arrive no later than 5pm. The search engines I checked only offer €3000+ flights.</p>

<p>I found a 2-stop combo through LHR and YVR for half that price. I'll probably have to check my baggage out and back in twice, but if the layover times are long enough, who cares?</p>

<p>A <em>real</em> search engine could find that for me (or something that's even better). Or, hell, give me a place to bulk-download the flight schedules from and I'll program it myself (of course I'd also need a way to check seat availability …).</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Please read before answering. A search engine which does this should, at minimum, show the flight combination through LHR which I found manually. Note that I need to arrive before 5pm, <em>on the same day</em>.</p>

<p>Also note that this is a generic question; I'm not looking for a specific good flight here -- but the details are useful to illustrate whether an answer is actually valid. :-/</p>

<p>NB: Typo, should have been July 29th.</p>
","<p>Since there seems to be a lot of confusion about what you are looking for, it could be useful to have a summary of what has been suggested (thanks and +1 to everybody who answered!). There are several types of tools you can use to find routes combining flights operated by different airlines:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Airlines' websites</strong> typically sell flights from other airlines (not only codeshare or partners from the same alliance but also flights that can be sold through interline agreements). Obviously there are many limitations but they <em>can</em> find at least some multiple airline combinations.</li>
<li><strong>Online Travel Agents</strong> (OTA) will combine products from multiple providers and sell them directly to you (typically using a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Distribution_System"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GDS</a> behind the scenes). OTA include <a href=""http://www.expedia.de/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Expedia</a>, <a href=""http://www.travelocity.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Travelocity</a>, <a href=""http://www.orbitz.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Orbitz</a> and in Germany <a href=""http://www.opodo.de/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Opodo</a>, <a href=""http://www.lastminute.de/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lastminute</a>, <a href=""http://www.travelscout24.de/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">TravelScout24</a>, HolidayCheck (apparently no naked flights) or <a href=""http://www.thomascook.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Thomas Cook</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Search engines</strong> or aggregators search various data sources to find potential connections but redirect you to other websites (either airlines or travel agents) to handle the booking itself. Aggregators include <a href=""http://www.kayak.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kayak</a>, <a href=""http://www.momondo.de/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Momondo</a>, <a href=""http://www.skyscanner.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Skyscanner</a>, <a href=""http://www.hipmunk.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hipmunk</a>, <a href=""http://adioso.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Adioso</a> and <a href=""http://www.google.com/flights/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Google Flights</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Other tools</strong> can also be useful. For example, <a href=""http://matrix.itasoftware.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Matrix Airfare Search</a> from ITA lets you look at the details of the fares and use advanced routing codes to refine your search. Unlike all other search engines, it does not provide any link to book the ticket. I don't know much about it but <a href=""http://www.kvstool.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">KVS Availability Tool</a> might also be relevant.</li>
</ul>

<p>The various search engines have slightly different functionality (filtering, specifying complex routes, selecting airlines, exploring various destinations, comparing prices when you are flexible on the date, etc.) Some are more focused on naked flights, other push hotels, car hires, or packages but nearly all <em>can</em> find multiple airlines combinations and many can beat your EUR 3000 price on FRA-YLW. Among the search engines listed above, at least ITA's Matrix, Kayak, Momondo, Hipmunk, Adioso, and Google Flights can also filter by time of arrival.</p>

<p>One thing that very few sites do is combine separate <em>tickets</em> (i.e. list flights that for some reason can't be booked together as one ticket). Generally speaking doing that is a bad idea since when anything unexpected happens (delay, cancellation, luggage problem), you're on your own. Because of that most search engines won't show a “connection” that involve a low-cost airline as these often don't handle connections or sell tickets through third parties at all. Still, at least <a href=""http://www.rome2rio.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">rome2rio</a> and <a href=""http://www.tnooz.com/article/kayak-pairs-one-way-flights-into-hacker-fares/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kayak</a> seem to do that in some cases (but, because of the drawbacks noted above, they will only display it if nothing reasonably similar as far as price and duration is concerned is available). <a href=""http://www.azair.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">azair</a> and <a href=""https://www.kiwi.com/en/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kiwi.com</a>, which specialise in low-cost flights will also do that for you.</p>

<p>For travel agents or aggregators, expanding resources on flights that can't be sold, expose travelers to a lot of problems and might not even be that much cheaper does not make sense. Given that your unspecified connection over LHR was apparently significantly more expensive and cumbersome than the ones found by most websites (including the Condor/Westjet solution mentioned by jpatokal or djhurio), there is no reason why it should figure prominently in anyone's results. Yet, if you drill down their results, rome2rio, Google Flights or Momondo all have FRA-LHR-SEA-YLW or FRA-LHR-YYC-YLW connections around EUR 1800 (at the time of writing) that sound very much like the one you described.</p>

<p>Now, if you are looking for an <em>exhaustive</em> search engine that could find any arbitrary connection then that does not exist as far as I know. Everybody who knows something about the industry seem to agree that it would be much more difficult than you suspect (see <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/11501/one-way-versus-return-airfare-tickets/11504#11504"">this earlier answer</a> and <a href=""http://www.demarcken.org/carl/papers/ITA-software-travel-complexity/img0.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this presentation</a> for a glimpse into the issue). Note that the problem is not so much finding a route (that's a well-known problem) but also getting all the data in the first place and coming up with a price that can be booked. All the tools listed here are designed to find actual bookable tickets, not idly explore flight routes.</p>

<p>If there is a specific reason why you want another connection than the ones found until now, then you need to explain what that reason is. Otherwise, it's difficult to meaningfully search for it. In any case, the problem is not merely that your solution involves multiple airlines because all search engines are fully able to find such connections.</p>

"What class of travel is suitable for a woman travelling alone on Indian railways?","17157","","<p>What class should a lone woman travel on a sleeper train to be safe at night?</p>
","<p>Non-airconditioned classes tend to have less strict ticket checks starting with the lowest class and gradually increasing till the highest class. <em>Unreserved</em> coaches are usually jam-packed with no place to sleep; you often have to travel standing even at night and not advised. <em>Three-tier non-AC</em> (three bunk beds in one 'column') and <em>second class / two-tier non-AC</em> (also called <em>sleeper class</em>; two bunk beds in one 'column') is the most common class of travel and it is safe for women if travelling in a group. Air-conditioned classes tend to have stricter staff supervision, ticket checking, and more numerous police patrols. (<em>First class non-AC</em> enjoys the same benefits too.) Although AC coaches are more expensive, for solo women travellers it might be worth the peace-of-mind. Look out whether the destinations you want to travel to/from are serviced by 'Duronto Express' or 'Garib Rath' named trains as these offer air-conditioned coaches at non-AC prices, and travel almost non-stop between destinations thus sometimes getting you up to a day earlier than other trains (which means, one less day spent overnight).</p>

<p>For solo women travellers, safety in second/sleeper class depends on what region you are travelling in: as a rough guide, most trains running or originating  south India are 'safer' than ones running or originating in north India. Rather than outright theft, what will probably be of greater concern for solo women travellers would be getting stared at or harassed by men trying to hit on you; it's a sad fact but it happens more in the north than it does in the south. If available, check whether there are women-only or 'ladies compartments' on the train you're travelling in. Cases of theft or robbery are much more common in the Uttar Pradesh-Bihar-Madhya Pradesh region than they are anywhere else.</p>

<p>In case issues arise, contacting the ticket checker (known as 'TTE' on Indian trains, will help to know this term in case you want to ask someone where he is; 'TTE' stands for 'Train Ticket Examiner') the best thing to do. TTEs are higher ranking officials, usually speak English well enough to be understandable at the very least, and will be able to coordinate with railway police personnel onboard if so required.</p>

<p>Does it make any difference if I'm on tourist island (such as Langkawi, Phuket, Ko Samui) far from the city?</p>
","<p>I've been to Thailand renting a scooter from different hotels, agencies on different islands and they never ask you for driving license when renting a scooter. Renting a scooter is very popular and it costs only around 200-250baht/day.

  is a contracting state of the 1949 treaty, which most are.  (See
  motoring law below)  If you are a resident, however, you require a

<p>Although I have visited Germany twice and always traveled with trains and buses there, I just came to know after reading a few articles that parking a car on the Autobahn with an empty tank is illegal.</p>

<p>Question: What happens if a tourist runs out of gas on the Autobahn and isn't aware of German autobahn law? How to cope with this situation?</p>

<p>Can drivers finding themselves in this predicament be subject to fines? Is penalty the same for everyone regardless of nationality?</p>
","<p>It is illegal to run out of gas on the Autobahn according to the German <em>StVO (Straßenverkehrsordnung)</em> which is the road traffic regulations in Germany. The fine can be from €30 up to €70 depending on the case.</p>

<p>The reason why it is illegal is that stopping on the highway due to insufficient petrol can be avoided and is a human error and therefore punishable.</p>

<p>Normally stopping on the highway in case of a breakdown has no fee but because this can be avoided and the driver has to make sure it does not happen it costs money. </p>

<p>It's worth mentioning that if you are a member of ADAC and call them (equivalent of AA, road service), and you are lucky and they get there before someone like the police gets there, they are able to sell you some petrol and you get out of it without a fine from the police.</p>

<blockquote>

"What kind of wind gusts prevent planes from landing at Wellington airport?","17150","","<p>ie, <a href=""http://www.wellingtonairport.co.nz/weather"">today's report</a> says gusts of about 70km/h, with Northerly winds of 46km/h.</p>

<p>I'd like to be able to guesstimate chances of flights arriving based on current winds. My first flight here had an aborted landing due to winds bouncing the plane around on approach....</p>
","<p>In general there is no 'maximum' winds that an aircraft can land in, however for each type of aircraft there is a maximum ""crosswind"" component that the aircraft can land in.  For most large commercial jets this is around 35 knots (~65 km/hour).</p>

<p>Cross-wind is basically the amount of the wind that is coming from the side of the aircraft.  For example, if you're facing directly into the direction of the wind, then the cross-wind is zero - no matter how strong the wind is.  As you turn further away from the direction of the wind the cross-wind component increases, until you're side-on to the wind in which case the cross-wind component is the entire force of the wind.</p>

<p>Many airlines will have limits for cross-winds that may be below the maximum allowed for a specific type of plane.  Even if the winds are below the maximum allowed, it is always at the pilots discretion as to whether they will attempt a landing in current conditions - so even if the cross-winds are below all allowed maximums they may still determine that it's too dangerous and divert to another airport.</p>

<p>Headwinds are generally far less of an issue.  Even an extremely strong head-wind will not cause any issues for a flight - and in fact they can be beneficial to landing as the plane can remain at a higher speed relative to the air when they come in to land - due to the air movement!</p>

<p>Tailwinds are a problem, and planes will generally not land with anything more than a relatively small tailwind, however this can be easily handled by landing in the opposite direction and turning the tailwind into a headwind!</p>

<p>Wellington is an airport well known for it's winds, and its frequently bumpy landing - due both to the frequent windy days in the Wellington area, but also due to the way the airport is situated on a relatively exposed hill very close to the entrance of Wellington Harbour. It has a single runway which runs roughly north-south (34/16).</p>

<p>Presuming the winds are northerly as you've described, this works well for the runway location. Planes can land from the south, turning the wind into a headwind.  As the winds are never perfectly in the direction of the runway there will always be a small ""cross-wind"" component, but for the strength of winds you've mentioned it would not normally be sufficient to cause any issues.</p>

<p>Of course, wind conditions can change by the second, and the pilots will react on those changes, so aborted landings are not uncommon and are just a part of the pilots doing their job of landing the plane safely!</p>

<p>Anything is possible - but given the conditions you've described I would not expect any issues for WLG in those winds.  They might lead to a few minor delays, but unless the conditions change for the worse I wouldn't expect any cancellations due to the weather.</p>

<p>Is there any way to get passport stamps like non-EU citizens? You can identify yourself with the passport of course, but they don't stamp it.</p>

<p>The basic premise of the answer is that according to law a stamp is indicating immigration control of the passport holder, which under the <a href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2004:158:0077:0123:EN:PDF"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">directive</a> linked on the same answer becomes illegal since it prevents free movement of the citizens within the Union's territory.</p>

<p>So generally immigration control won't stamp your passport from a member state.</p>

If you have added a document (single page) stating that you've only been working two years, and have provided all tax returns from your entire work history, that should satisfy them that there's 1) nothing missing, 2) nothing being hidden and 3) the 'question' of the missing tax year has been answered.</p>

<p>Short version: document any gap / discrepancy in your application.  It's very hard to have 'too much' documentation.</p>

"Why do flight attendants say in safety instructions that you should put on your own mask before helping others?","17093","","<p>I have taken several flights from Emirates, FlyDubai and Saudi Airlines. Why is it announced to put your own mask on before helping others with their mask. I wouldn't do it if I am travelling with my family. I would like to help them first. So what's the reason?</p>
","<p>It's actually quite simple.  The reason they do this is to make sure you <strong>are</strong> able to help others.  What do I mean by this?  During an emergency where the air in the plane is thinning, it is important that you are able to breathe.  You can become light headed and if you are trying to help someone put their mask on and you are becoming dizzy, it isn't as effective if you are able to think clearly in the situation.</p>

<p>Think about it this way, imagine you and a friend have been shot in the leg.  If you are in agony and can't think clearly, how much do you think you can help your friend?  Now imagine you have stopped the bleeding on your own leg and bandaged it.  You are now much more capable of providing aid to your friend.</p>

<p>The same applies here.  If you are sitting next to your family and becoming dizzy, disoriented, and fumbling with your child's mask, you are not just harming yourself to save the child, but also not giving the best aid possible.  It is much better to put your own mask on, remain calm, think clearly, and provide aid to your family so that neither are hindered.</p>

<p>I'd like to add this (sourced from here: <a href=""https://cockpitvoice.wordpress.com/2015/07/02/oxygen-mask-adult-first-and-then-children-why/"">Flight Safety</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First of all you should know that in a commercial passenger flight the
  oxygen masks contain enough oxygen only for 12 minutes and after that
  everyone on board will go unconscious due to Hypoxia (oxygen
  deprivation). If the flight is at an higher altitude like 20,000 ft.
  or above, within 20 to 60 seconds one can get unconscious. This is the
  main reason flight attendants always advise you to put the oxygen
  masks first and then assist your children or other passengers – in
  case of an emergency.</p>

"What regulations should a European driver know when driving in the US?","17061","","<p>There are the obvious ones. The US has the keep-your-lane system, where as in Europe you are expected to keep to the right (left for UK) as long as possible. 
On my latest travel to the US, I was confronted with the possibility to go through a red light if you turn right, unless it is explicitly not allowed.</p>

<p><strong>What should a european driver know when driving in the US?</strong> What are the do's and don'ts compared to driving in Europe. </p>
","<p>The other two answers pretty well covered things, but here are a few more notes:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_turn_on_red#Left_turn_on_red"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">In some states, it is legal to make a left turn through a red light if both intersecting streets are one way.</a>  (In other words, one can treat the red light as a stop sign.)</li>
<li>In some (maybe all?) states, one can be ticketed for driving too slow, even if there is no posted minimum speed limit. (The citation is usually for something like, ""Impeding the flow of traffic."")</li>
<li>In most states, it is illegal to be seen drinking alcohol in public, including (and especially) as a passenger in a car.  However, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_open_container_laws#Open_containers_in_vehicles"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">there are some states in which it is legal for car passengers to drink alcohol</a>.  In Mississippi, it is still legal for drivers to consume alcohol while driving, as long as their blood alcohol content is below 0.08%.</li>
<li>From personal experience, I've noticed that in some European countries it is common for cars that are about to overtake on a highway to hover for a while between two lanes (I saw this a lot in Iberia).  Also, in Scandanavia in particular, I saw a lot of cars in the right lane actually move onto the shoulder while being overtaken.  In my experience, I have never seen either of these practices in the US, and they likely violate many states' regulations.</li>
<li>Given the automotive boom of the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century, many large, multi-lane roads were built.  As such, putting traffic lights at the intersections of these 3+ lane roads to allow left turns became a bottleneck.  Therefore, some states implemented other means of turning left on large roads.  For example, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jughandle"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">jughandle turn</a> is very common, especially in the Northeast.  The ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_left"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Median U-Turn Crossover</a>"" is also very common in Michigan.</li>
<li>This last note isn't so much about regulations, but I'd highly recommend bringing or renting a GPS/SatNav. Unlike in most of Europe, I find signage in the US to be particularly bad. For example, in Europe there are often signs in the countryside pointing one to the direction for the nearest cities. In the US, such signs usually only point to the closest highway, so unless you know specifically which highway will point you to your destination, you may be out of luck.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Additions</strong> (2011-07-19):</p>

<ul>
<li>In an increasing number of states, it is illegal to operate a mobile phone while driving.  The wording of the laws varies by state; in some it is even illegal to touch a mobile phone while driving.  In most (if not all) states it is okay to use a hands-free device (<em>e.g.</em>, a bluetooth headset), though.</li>
<li>In some states (<em>e.g.</em>, Oregon and New Jersey) it is illegal to pump your own fuel; <em>all</em> of the gas stations are ""full service"" (<em>i.e.</em>, an attendant must pump the fuel for you).  In these states it is not necessary for you to tip the attendant for his or her service, although I am sure it is appreciated.  I am not sure about Oregon, but at least in New Jersey I know that it is illegal to exit your vehicle while your fuel is being pumped (presumably for the safety of the attendant).  I believe these laws were enacted in the late 1940s/early 1950s because the government thought that pumping fuel was too difficult and hazardous an activity for the average motorist.  The laws have probably persisted because repealing them would mean the loss of a great number of gas attendant jobs. In Oregon, it is possible to find yourself stranded after hours in the middle of nowhere until the gas station opens, so plan ahead.</li>
<li>If you plan on using a radar detector, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_detector"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the laws vary by state</a> (much in the same way that they vary by country in Europe).  In general, it is legal to use a radar detector in all states <em>except</em> Virginia and Washington, D.C.  In some states (<em>e.g.</em>, Minnesota and California), it is illegal to mount the radar detector from the windshield, since it obstructs the driver's vision.</li>

"Baggage tagged with ""limited release""","16995","","<p><strong>Background information:</strong></p>

<p>During a recent Air France flight, I had a very unexpected situation: at the counter I was informed that my baggage to be checked was <em>below the minimum weight, which is of 5 kg</em>.</p>

<p>I had never heard of the existence of a minimum weight for checked luggage, and I've not been able to find any information about it on their website.</p>

<p>According to the employee on the counter, this limit exists to ""prevent damage to the luggage"". I've been forced to put extra objects in my checked baggage to meet this minimum weight. Still, the baggage ticket I was given contained the term ""LIMITED RELEASE"".</p>

<p>I had never seen this term, and I surely have not been informed about it by the employee. I expected that meeting the required 5kg would be enough to enable my baggage to be considered as standard.</p>

<p>I find it extremely annoying that they are allowed to simply stick this ""limited release"" term without warning. </p>

<p><strong>Actual question:</strong></p>

<p>What are the conditions for a piece of baggage to be considered <em>limited release</em>? Can the airline simply label any baggage this way? And what are its consequences? Does it minimize the airline responsibility in any way?</p>

<p>Note that, on the way back, I put more stuff in the baggage so it was way above the minimum required, and this time they did not add the ""limited release"".</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: It's worse than I thought. I've just been to Orly again, on the same flight, and <strong>both my bags</strong> (standard hard-case luggage, within the weight limits) got tagged with limited release. Then I asked the counter lady what it meant. She didn't know, and then she asked her supervisor, and then I later asked 3 more people (two from Air France and one from Iberia), all of which gave me the same answer: they claimed that, at least in Orly, this is standard for <strong>everyone</strong>, for all flights and companies, and it means <em>nothing</em>. Why then put it on the ticket? No one could answer, not even the people responsible for baggage inquiries, and I had a plane to catch so I couldn't keep asking on. I invite you to do it if you ever have some spare time. I'm not convinced they would simply write it out for no reason, so it must somehow benefit them. Otherwise they might just do like for the return flight, where there was no such mention.</p>
","<p>Here's my limited understanding of limited release :)
Baggage is basically divided into 3 categories: baggage that the airline <em>will</em> accept, baggage that it will <em>not</em> accept based on its rules, and baggage that it will <em>only</em> accept if you agree to ""limited release"": I.e. they will only accept the piece of baggage if you agree, in writing, to release the airline from liability for your baggage. </p>

<p>The release is ""limited"" only to a specific condition - i.e. if there was a problem because of the weight of your bag, they wouldn't be liable, but if they misrouted your baggage and it ended up on the other end of the globe, they would still be responsible - it's not a ""complete"" release. </p>

<p>In any case, when they want limited release, they will generally make you sign something (generally there's space for it on the luggage tag). If you didn't sign anything and they just marked it ""limited release"" by themselves, I doubt it has any effect - perhaps they wanted you to sign it, but then changed their mind when you added more weight to the bag?</p>

<p>But of course I'm not a lawyer, and all this could depend on the laws of the country where you're flying, etc, so take all this with a grain of salt. Perhaps there are some places where an airline can just decide on ""limited release"" based on e.g. some fine print in the contract of carriage that gives it the right to do so, even without your signature.</p>

"Why do airlines not have you put your bag underneath your own seat?","16994","","<p>On airplanes, they tell you to put your bags either in the overhead or under the seat <em>in front</em> of you. Considering that the front row doesn't have a seat in front of them, and the back seats don't have anything under them, would it not be more efficient to have people put their backs underneath their own seats?</p>

<p>Please don't give me an answer about legroom. We all know airlines don't care about our legroom. </p>
","<p>I can think of two reasons.  One, sadly, you have disallowed, which is the legroom answer. But what if the answer actually <em>is</em> about legroom?  Since I don't have enough room for my knees, I have to straighten my legs, which requires me to put my feet under the seat in front of me. It seems to me that if passengers were supposed to put bags under their own seat, people would be fighting over that space more than they already are. </p>

<p>The other reason is safety.  That space has a bar to keep the things in there from sliding forward in a crash.  This serves as a barrier between the space and the occupant of the seat above.  If the bar were at the back of the seat instead of the front, it would allow things to fly into the aisle between the rows, injuring passengers' feet or impeding their egress.   </p>

"How expensive is Belgium?","16981","","<p>Let me clarify a bit: how much should I expect to spend on food per day in Belgium if I am eating out nearly every meal?  Does it vary by city?  If so, how does Brussels compare? How about the French speaking part of the country?</p>

<p>I have done some research on my own, and found that the cost of living is quite high, but this refers to renting an apartment, taxes, etc.  There was no mention of the price of restaurants or local food as it compares to, say, a large US city (not NYC), which is my reference point.</p>
","<p>Compared to an average US city, I expect you to find Belgium a very expensive country. Taxi's are extremely expensive, expect to pay >25Euro's for inner city trips. Having said that, public transport like trains and buses is really really cheap. The Belgian Railways have a card called <a href=""http://www.b-rail.be/nat/E/tarifs/passes/go/index.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Go Pass (&lt;26)</a>
 or <a href=""http://www.b-rail.be/nat/E/tarifs/passes/rail/index.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Rail Pass</a> which makes traveling through Belgium rather cheap. </p>

<p>Since I am local to Belgium, I am not a good reference on cost of accommodation. If you are traveling in a group, you might consider going for self-catering <a href=""http://www.belgiumtheplaceto.be/guest_houses.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">accommodation</a>. Also check booking.com, which is a service that worked for me in many European cities. They often have very interesting offers on the day itself.</p>

<p>On food the choices are huge. 
""Frieten"" or French Fries start just below 2 Euro. Being a local dish Belgians consider part of their local heritage I would recommend to at least once visit a local ""Frituur"". 
Other cheap options are going to the restaurants in the shopping malls, especially from the chains, but don't expect anything special there. Another cheap ""fastfood"" solution can be found in the many kebab places. </p>

<p>Then there are the all you can eat places. Almost every city or bigger village does have a ""wokchinees"", or a Chinese restaurant where you can eat as much as you can for around 25-30 euro's. A different cuisine, but also all you can eat can be found at the <a href=""http://www.colmar.be/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Colmar</a> (Link in French and Dutch only).</p>

<p>In general I would say that a decent restaurant dinner would start at costing you 20 Euros per person. Be aware that in Belgium you pay for the water you order. There are <a href=""http://www.lunchbox.be/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">exceptions</a> (I am not affiliated), but in general a glass of water will start at 1-1.5 Euro's. You don't get tapwater, although in Belgium tapwater is of high quality.</p>

<p>Take home dishes (pizza or kebab) will start around 5 euro.</p>

<p>If you are in Belgium in the Summer try to locate a local cultural festival like the one running in Antwerp: ""<a href=""http://www.zomervanantwerpen.be/2012/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Zomer van Antwerpen</a>"" with its <a href=""http://www.zomervanantwerpen.be/2012/nl/zomerbar"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">zomerbar</a>. Usually these festivals aim at a local audience (hence the Dutch only websites), but sometimes you can find some really nice dishes there for very decent prices and the atmosphere is usually brilliant. </p>

<p>The best advise I can give is to go outside the tourist centers to find a decent dish for a decent price. This also fits Brussels. </p>

It took a lot of grovelling on my part to be let on board.</p>

","<p>To <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/a/13343/1046"">@MeNoTalk's excellent answer</a>, I'd like to add the passenger perspective:</p>

<p>If you know that you may vomit during the flight, prepare yourself: </p>

<ul>
<li>Have a change of clothes in your carry-on, in case you manage to vomit over your shirt and pants, plus a plastic bag to store your dirty clothes. </li>
<li>Bring tissues, or a towel, to clean up. </li>
<li>Make sure that there actually <em>is</em> a vomit bag in your seat pocket as you board, and move it somewhere you can easily reach, maybe get your neighbor's one as well, just in case. Do please put the unused bags back, though. </li>
<li>Talk to the crew, since they're really helpful. They may even be better equipped than you to clean up the mess, so don't try to fix it all by yourself. </li>
<li>If you're flying with a person you know may need assistance (such as a kid that won't give you much advance warning), be on high alert during turbulence (obviously), but also during pressure changes, i.e. take-off and landing (same problem as altitude sickness). Best wait a few minutes to calm down any upset stomach before exiting the plane. </li>
<li>to freshen up afterward, you may want to bring your toothbrush and toothpaste (there are small enough toothpaste tubes so that you're below the 100ml container liquid/gels rule). Alternatively, you can bring some mints/chewing gum (thanks, @zuallauz for the suggestion)</li>

"Why is Amtrak so expensive in the Northeastern US?","16847","","<p>Why is Amtrak so darn expensive in the Northeast US?  I just looked up a train from New London, CT to Boston, MA (a 2 hour car trip); the round trip cost for two people was $200. Traveling by rail in Europe is significantly cheaper; any ideas why?</p>
","<p>As noted elsewhere, you cannot take the price of a single itinerary on a single route on a single date and make conclusions about rail travel on a single service compared to rail travel on an entire continent.</p>

<p>Even if you could, it would not hold. I tried some bookings for 27 February at 0800. Amtrak's Acela Express would be $78. SNCF quotes me 70 EUR (~96 USD) for Paris to Brussels, DB quotes me 59 EUR (~81 USD) for Hamburg to Berlin, and a Hikari train on the Tokaido Shinkansen from Shizuoka to Shinagawa is 6,180 JPY (~61 USD). But on a short trip like this, there is no reason to take the Acela, as the Northeast Regional is almost as fast, and would only cost $36.</p>

<p>But Amtrak costs what it does fundamentally because the price of transportation depends on <strong>supply and demand</strong>. While the balance can be distorted by things like subsidies, the constraints on both explain why a flight from DC to New York costs as much as a flight from DC to Los Angeles, even though it is only one-tenth the distance. And in this respect, <strong>Amtrak remains broadly competitive</strong> with other modes of transportation along the NEC.</p>

<p>Ten years ago I never took Amtrak; why would I when I could get from Downtown DC to Midtown Manhattan, door to door, within 3 hours, for $116 round trip on the Shuttle? Nowadays, with more rigorous airport security, capacity reductions, higher fuel prices, and transit service cuts among things, I would allot at least 4½ hours and $340. To drive would also take 4-5 hours, and entail almost $60 in tolls and $50 in gasoline, plus the stress of driving I-95 and the New Jersey Turnpike and then finding parking. So Amtrak offering me a round trip for $260 is compelling. (yes, there is the bus as well, but it's as uncomfortable as the plane and as slow as Amtrak and as dangerous as driving, so naturally you should expect a discount.)</p>

<p>And while Amtrak does not practice price discrimination as ruthlessly as the airlines do, this may partly explain why your NLC-BOS ticket seems overpriced: they don't want someone riding NLC-BOS if they can sell the same seat for more profit to a NYP-BOS passenger.</p>

"How to make dining alone less awkward?","16707","","<p>When travelling, I'm often alone in a city. This is okay for me, except for one situation: dining out alone is just awkward. Guests in restaurants are almost always either couples or groups and being alone is weird. I'm looking for tactics to make this less awkward. At the moment I just spend most of the time playing with my smart phone. Actually I'm writing this question exactly while waiting for my food.</p>
","<p>Dining alone is only awkward for you (that is, it's an internal thing). It doesn't bother any of the restaurant staff, and it doesn't bother any of the other customers. So, you have to figure out what makes <em>you</em> uncomfortable about eating alone.</p>

<p>There are some ways you can mitigate this feeling:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Find somewhere where there are also other people eating alone. If you're travelling, you can almost always find a hotel or airport restaurant with other solo customers. The presence of others eating their own meals alone might be enough to make you feel better about doing the same thing.</p></li>
<li><p>If the restaurant has a bar, you can often get meals served at the bar. You'll often find other people doing this too. That way you don't have an empty seat across from you. You can even strike up a conversation with the bartender if you are so inclined.</p></li>
<li><p>Find a table or seat that doesn't face other customers, such as looking out a window. </p></li>
<li><p>Do what you're doing now, absorb yourself in your mobile technology. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>I also used to feel extremely awkward about eating alone. I can clearly remember specific restaurants from years ago where I was feeling really uncomfortable eating by myself. However, somewhere along the way I realised that there wasn't anything to be uncomfortable about, and today I have no trouble eating alone. </p>

"What is the longest stretch of the Autobahn that is guaranteed to have no speed limits?","16640","","<p>I would like to rent a nice sports car this summer and go for a drive on the Autobahn. What is the longest stretch of the German highways that is <em>guaranteed</em> (short of a natural disaster) to have no speed limits? </p>

<p>If there's more than one such long stretch, which one is likely to have the least amount of traffic?</p>
","<p>I didn’t find any maps that included the actual lengths of stretches, but I found two that at least tell you the speed limit (or absence of one). I entered the legs into Google maps to get their lengths.</p>

<p>I found one map on <a href=""http://www.autobahn-speedhunter.com/map_en.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">autobahn-speedhunter.com</a> from 2012 (according to copyright) and another from <a href=""http://www.autobahnatlas-online.de/Limitkarte.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">autobahnatlas-online.de</a> (<a href=""http://www.autobahnatlas-online.de/LegendeLimit.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">link to the second map’s colours’ explanation</a>; solid blue streches have no limit) from 2009. The <em>autobahnatlas</em> map is from 2009 and no longer maintained due to the work involved. The <em>speedhunter</em> one relies on input by users to report new (or removed) speed limits thus it may or may not be entirely accurate. To the best of my knowledge there is no official source and documentation of the beginning and ending of speed limits.</p>

<p>Contestants for longest stretches with the validity caveat given above, taken from the <em>autobahn-speedhunter</em> map:</p>

<ul>
<li>A 38, A 14 and A 4 from <a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/DaBJkAmxTTu"" rel=""noreferrer"">Göttingen to Dresden</a> (c. 312 km)</li>
<li>A 20 from <a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/o8T2BRarv2v"" rel=""noreferrer"">Lübeck to Prenzlau</a> (c. 290 km)</li>
<li>A 7 from <a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/hV3g4qCxaNv"" rel=""noreferrer"">Bad Hersfeld to Aalen</a> (c. 252 km)</li>
<li>A 31 from <a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/xPmuDtGP3892"" rel=""noreferrer"">Papenburg to Bottrop</a> (c. 185 km)</li>
<li>A 96 from <a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/Q4sqM8ywmax"" rel=""noreferrer"">Munich to Lindau</a> (c. 170 km)</li>
<li>A 3 and A 92 from <a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/edjuTLHchkB2"" rel=""noreferrer"">Passau to Erding</a> (c. 148 km)</li>
<li>A 5 from <a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/V8bngA48foF2"" rel=""noreferrer"">Karlsruhe to Freiburg</a> (c. 116 km)</li>
<li>A 81 from South of <a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/BnebrCmLab72"" rel=""noreferrer"">Stuttgart to Singen</a> (c. 109 km)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that I have the feeling that the map is not entirely accurate; e.g. <em>autobahnatlas</em> mentions speed limits in the Landshut area on the A 92. Many people have confirmed similar issues with the A96 (a 120 km/h section in the centre around Memmingen), and the A5 (speed limit around Rastatt). I don’t know whether your information will get any better than this, though.</p>

<p>Traffic-wise, I would assume the A20 and A31 to be the ones with the least other cars and no significant lorry traffic (although most of these stretches are probably empty at 3 a.m. as Gayot mentioned). The A20 especially was criticised as being just some tarmac in the countryside without any cars travelling on it.</p>

<hr>

<h2>A note on the safety aspect</h2>

<p>Other answers have already said this, but it bears repeating. <strong>Be especially careful when driving at very high speeds, especially if you are not familiar with the car!</strong> Deceleration is quadratic with respect to distance so if ‘some idiot’ decides to pull over into the left lane at 130 km/h and you shoot in from behind you’ll have some serious braking to do. Worse if there was a curve.</p>

<p>90 % of all drivers think that they are among the best 10 % of drivers. Go figure.</p>

"Prohibited item forgotten in hand luggage: what to do with it?","16627","","<p>I guess it happens quite frequently: you have already checked in, and at the security check you realize that you have in your backpack your grandmother's Klingon bat'leth blade, an item that has been in your family for generations and that you absolutely do not want to throw away.</p>

<p><strong>What are your possibilities at this point? What do you do with a forbidden item with which you cannot fly, and which you do not want to throw away?</strong>, The airline company will probably offer to send it as a stored luggage, but that may be inconvenient (because of the price, or because the item is too fragile, too large, or too small). Are there other possibilities?</p>

<p>An option could be shipping it, but I have never seen a courier or a post office in an airport. I have never looked for one, actually, but if there are any they are not well advertised (unlike every other store in an airport), and I assume that they are not open at all the times of the day when an airport is operational. Are there any other possibilities?</p>
","<p>It happened to me once in London Heathrow.  In my case I didn't have any emotional attachment to the item and it only cost around £3 to replace, so I threw it away, however I discussed with the security and the airline what my options were.  They offered me the following options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Throw it away (I actually ended up doing just that)</li>
<li>Post it to whatever address I wanted it - in Heathrow airport, there is a post office, although not in every terminal.</li>
<li>I could put the item in a separate bag/whatever and check it in. If I didn't have a bag to put it into, there are plenty of shops landside that sell luggage (various bags, suitcases, etc.) - I could purchase the right size bag there, put the item in it and go back to the airline counter to check it in.  Depending on the airline and how many bags with how much weight you have already checked in, they may charge you for this additional one.</li>
<li>Refuse to fly - my checked in luggage would be returned to me, but I would forfeit the ticket.</li>
</ol>

<p>The main point to keep in mind is that you're still landside.  Depending on how much time you have left before your flight, you could even go back home, leave the item there and come back to the airport.  For example, if you're in Heathrow and live somewhere near Paddington, you can easily get from the terminal to home and back to the terminal in under an hour.</p>

<p>That said, your options may be very much limited by what airport you are in.</p>

<p>If everything else fails and the item is REALLY, REALLY priceless, you can always turn around, go to the airline desk and tell them that you changed your mind and don't want to fly.  They will then return you your checked in luggage.  You pack your item there, then buy another ticket.  Prepare to be quizzed by some men in black though :)  ""Changing your mind"" after having checked in is considered a very suspicious move.</p>

<p>P.S. The item that happened to be in my backpack was an 8mm drill bit for glass and tiles, which I lent to a colleague, then he returned it, I put it in a small outside pocket on the backpack - and completely forgot about it.  I flew with this backpack almost 3 months later - and ended up throwing the bit away, as buying a new one was the cheapest option.</p>

"Is it recommended to get vaccinations before visiting India?","16571","","<p>I'll be travelling to India soon.  I'm not sure if I'll have to time to get vaccinated since it usually takes 2 weeks to kick in.  Lonely Planet suggests a bunch of <a href=""http://www.lonelyplanet.com/india/practical-information/health"">vaccinations</a>.  Have any of you guys been travelling to India without any form of vaccinations lately?</p>
","<p>Indian immigration officials only really care about yellow fever vaccination certificates if you have travelled or were in transit within past week in <a href=""http://www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk/advice/disease-prevention/yellow-fever/yellow-fever-risk-areas.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">any region with high yellow fever risk</a>. This is a prerequisite for clearing immigration checkpoints so don't ignore it; albeit this is something that will affect only a small set of travellers to India as there aren't many direct flights from South America or Africa.
.
World Health Organisation also only lists information about malaria and yellow fever. <a href=""http://www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk/destinations/asia-%28east%29/india.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">A more pragmatic advice on vaccinations needed for India can be found on NHS Fit For Travel</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Courses or boosters usually advised</strong>: diphtheria; tetanus;
  poliomyelitis; hepatitis A; typhoid (polio not required for Andaman
  and Nicobar islands).</p>
  
  <p><strong>Vaccines sometimes advised</strong>: hepatitis B; rabies;
  Japanese encephalitis; cholera.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Assuming you have followed your country's standard immunisation course, whether you <em>really</em> need a vaccination depends. If you're going for a couple of days or a short 1-2 week trip, you probably don't need any of these.</p>

<p>For longer term travellers:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you plan to travel by trains or local public transport, I'd highly recommend getting a tetanus booster. Especially on public buses many surfaces are made of sheet metal and chances are that if it's old, it's going to have sharp corners you might jab yourself on. This is probably erring too much on the side of caution; still, you're better off getting one than panicking once you're on the road and not near a major city.</li>
<li>Any of the water-borne disease vaccinations such as cholera, typhoid, hepatitis A/B: this really depends. Some travellers are made of sterner stuff and can walk away with <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/2589/how-to-prevent-delhi-belly"">Delhi belly</a> at worst. Others are not - I've contracted typhoid twice in India, for instance (not when travelling though, grew up there). This is a call you need to take. If you plan to travel a lot to semi-urban/rural areas, then this will be sensible precaution to take.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, if you plan to travel for a longer term but haven't had time yet to get your vaccinations before flying in, consider getting vaccinated in India. You'll probably fly into a major city like Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chennai, or Kolkata and the standard of healthcare is generally pretty good in all these cities. Cost of private outpatient healthcare is relatively very cheap in India and you can just walk in without an appointment and get your vaccinations for a fraction of the cost of getting it in your home country. Most private clinics and practices have English-speaking staff and good standards of quality control. If pressed for ideas, just search online for 'Apollo Clinic' or 'Max Medicentre' in the particular city you're staying in - these are well-known private clinic chains. (Prices are slightly higher than usual at these chain private clinics.)</p>

","<p>No, you cannot.</p>

<p>This information is not available to the public nor is it obtainable from the airline(s) without some court order.</p>

<p>I would not put it beyond the reach of some clandestine intelligence organization though.</p>

<p>Even when law enforcement wants to know if someone has booked a flight, they usually have their name and another variable - such as a credit card or bank information against which to check; and then they work the way back to the airline.</p>

<p>However, I can imagine a scenario at a local airport where there are a handful of airlines, that law enforcement can compel them to reveal their bookings for that day - but that would have to be under court order and not without serious implications.</p>

<p>If you really do want to get to know this information; it is highly likely your boss used a travel agent to book these tickets (as group bookings are commonly done through agents - because online sites generally have a limit on the number of tickets; and agents usually give better discounts on such packages).</p>

"I was allowed to enter the airport terminal by showing a boarding pass for a future flight. Should I be concerned about ""security""?","16484","","<p>I take the same flight with the same company between two European neighboring countries once a month.  </p>

<p>My boarding passes are on my smartphone, but as I book my flights months in advance, I often have 3 or 4 boarding passes on my phone.  </p>

<p>During my previous flights, I noticed the security agents at the airport seem not to be really careful, so I decided to test them, trying to enter in my flight with the boarding pass for next month (legally bought, but valid only next month)</p>

<p>There are 3 security checkpoints in this airport:  </p>

<ul>
<li>First, before cabine luggage X-ray, someone from the company ask for people to show their boarding pass. So I showed the ""wrong"" pass on my smartphone, she looked at it a quarter of a second and wish me a pleasant flight... <em>First ""security"" checkpoint DONE</em></li>
<li>Then, where your cabine luggage is X-rayed, they ask for the boarding pass, and the QR code printed on it is read by a machine. I expected to be caught at this moment but the light turns green!<br>
So I was allowed to enter in international area with a wrong boarding pass!
What is checked at this moment ? Only if the QR code is valid ? If so, the date is not checked, which IMO is not normal. I'm not into IT security, but I guess it's not that hard to generate false QR codes to enter in any international area all around the world, which is a little bit freaky…<br>
<em>Second ""security"" checkpoint DONE</em></li>
<li>Finally, at the boarding gate, the light turns red when I presented the wrong card ; so I apologized, showed the right one and finally entered the flight.  </li>

<p>I don't know how to deal with this situation.<br>
Should I report my experience to the airport? Should I be worried about ""security""?  </p>

<p>Or is it just normal?</p>
","<p>You didn't skip any security controls. Your luggage was checked and you went through a metal scanner. Finally, you were not allowed on board without a proper ticket. The rest is just to prevent people from accompanying their friends and family to the gate. Merely being in the terminal is not a security flaw per se, since pretty much anyone can buy a ticket and enter the secure area.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, I've tried the same ""trick"" (QR code for a different flight) at Prague Airport recently and it didn't work for the terminal access scan. However the Duty Free was happy to sell me anything without a proper check, so it was in theory possible to buy alcohol for non-EU prices.</p>

However, my friend has a biometric passport, but no fingerprints in it. Is this enough? And how long has the passport to be valid? Is it okay if it expires on the day after his return date?</p>
","<h2>What kind of passport do I need?</h2>

<p>See the <a href=""https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta/WebHelp/ESTA_Screen-Level_Online_Help_1.htm#vwp4"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">passport requirements for travel under the Visa Waiver Program</a>. (The VWP applies to German citizens among others.) It says this about biometric passports:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>October 26, 2006 – Each Visa Waiver Program passport issued on or
  after this date must be an electronic passport with a digital chip
  containing biometric information about the passport owner.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My passport doesn't contain fingerprints (to my knowledge), but that wasn't a problem (2011). What happens is <strong>they take your fingerprints &amp; photograph when entering the country.</strong>  (If the passport <em>does</em> contain your fingerprint data already, I'm not sure if they'd just read that or take the fingerprints again.)</p>

<p>So yes, your friend should be fine.</p>

<p>To be more precise, the passport only needs to be electronic &amp; biometric if it was issued on or after October 26, 2006.

I found an economic flight around mid-December.</p>

<p>I have two questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What will the weather be? Do I have to expect to really cold temperature and feelings or they will be not too much different with respect to Italy?</li>
<li>Will I find some special decorations and feel the ""Christmas spirit""?</li>
</ul>

<p>The weather in the UK is notoriously variable, so the only way to know for sure is to check nearer the time. But it's likely to be around freezing, maybe as low as -10C or as high as +10C. I would certainly bring some warm clothes. Snow is possible, but doesn't happen every year. If the weather is very cold or snowy, prepare for potential public transport delays.</p>

<p>London is normally dressed up for Christmas, yes. You should find Piccadilly Circus/Oxford Street in particular will have Christmas decorations up. Depending on how close it is to Christmas, prepare for potential crowding in some popular tourist areas (e.g. Oxford Street is often busy).</p>

<p>London has a lovely atmosphere around Christmas, though. Hope you enjoy your trip! Like all enormous cities, plenty will be happening. <a href=""http://www.timeout.com/london/"">Time Out</a> is a good place to look for events / restaurants / etc.</p>

"Left UK without passing through Immigration, why?","16436","","<p>Last year, I traveled to the UK for a conference. Upon entry, my passport was stamped confirming my entry via immigration.</p>

<p>Upon my exit, surprisingly (and something I'm been wondering about ever since) I went through <strong>no immigration</strong>. The direction to board flight led me straight to flight check-in, then we boarded the flight.</p>

<p>Below is my entry stamp. Stamped within my Visa stamp, really?
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/US2JX.jpg"" alt=""My passport, with only an entry stamp, stamped even at the &quot;wrong&quot; side?""></p>

<p>I went to the Netherlands this year, got stamped, in and out. Entering ZA, I got stamped. Even leaving and returning to my home country (Ghana), I got both stamped. I find the stamping a standard procedure/protocol.</p>

<p>Yet, with the UK, I left the country without being stamped. I don't know if that was part of the plan or I missed something or what?:</p>

<ul>
<li>Does the UK have a policy of not stamping when people leave the country?</li>
<li>Was that a mistake on my part?</li>
<li>Obviously, my stay period has expired, and on paper, I'm ""not supposed"" to be in the country, but without the UK exit stamp, might that affect my visit or travel visa application to UK one day in the future? Because if stamping is mandatory, and I don't have one, then I will be hot if asked, ""How did you leave the country without the stamp?""</li>
<li>In this case, those who could have determined if I overstayed or not, was the Airline</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>More info</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>My visa was for a stay up to 29/30 days or so. But I stayed only for 7 days</li>
<li>Flight used throughout was Emirates and passed through Dubai on transit</li>
<li>Origin was South Africa.</li>
<li>Destination Airport was Heathrow</li>
</ul>

<p>For comparison, below is my Netherlands stamps, both in an out.

I see a strong reason to, otherwise, stamping me in is of no <em>real reason</em> then.</p>

<p>One commentator also added: <code>""A loophole which no doubt has been exploited by some foreigners.""</code> No idea how someone will exploit that!</p>

<p>And considering <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/39908/no-exit-stamp-on-leaving-schengen-area-from-budapest-to-uk"">this instance</a>, it can lead to some questionings.</p>
","<p>The UK, the USA, Canada, Ireland and Mexico do not impose systematic exit controls on departing passengers. You were not ""stamped out"" because it is currently deemed an unnecessary use of resources. No such exit stamp exists.</p>

"What if you don't get an ETA for a flight to Australia?","16376","","<p>As a US citizen, I've gone to Australia twice, and dutifully signed up for the ETA visa on the website and paid my $20 or so and had no hassles on entry.  There was no mention of the ETA at any point in the ticketing or passport control process.</p>

<p>My question: what happens if you just don't get the ETA and assume your passport is sufficient?  Is it caught by the airline before check-in, or at passport control in Australia?  And do they issue them on the spot, or is this grounds for refusing entry?</p>
","<p>The ""E"" in ETA stands for ""Electronic"", and that pretty much refers to the entire process.  Not only do you apply electronically (eg, on the <a href=""http://www.eta.immi.gov.au/"">ETA website</a>), but the airlines are responsible for electronically checking that you have obtained an ETA or a Visa.</p>

<p>Presuming that your previous flights to Australia have been from the US, you may recall that whilst you were waiting to board the flight they were calling specific people to the podium for a ""documentation check"" - these are for the people where they have not been able to confirm that they have an ETA, and they will be required to check that they do have the relevant approval to enter Australia (such as a physical visa).</p>

<p>Once you actually arrive in Australia the Immigration staff are able to see that you have a current ETA electronically, and thus do not need to see any further details from you.</p>

<p>If you don't have an ETA (or a Visa, etc) then you will not be allowed to board the plane - it is the airline's responsibility to confirm that you have an ETA before they let you on the flight, and in general they will be fined if they do not so don't expect to be able to talk your way on!</p>

<p>One minor point of semantics, what you have is not an ""ETA Visa"", it's an ""Electronic Travel Authority"", or ""ETA"".  The ETA is specifically NOT a ""Visa"" as such. The distinction isn't normally all that important, and you'll frequently hear people refer to it as an ""ETA Visa"", but technically it's not correct.  The main place where this becomes relevant is if your application for an ETA is denied and you have to apply for a Visa instead.  When filling out the Visa application one of the questions is whether you've ever been denied a visa for Australia before, and then answer will be NO, despite being denied an ETA - because the ETA is NOT a visa!</p>

"Rent a rental car while your driving license is suspended in your home country?","16370","","<p>A friend plans to go to USA in June. There he wants to rent a car to travel through the country. Unfortunately, he got a speeding ticket during the last weeks now his driving license is suspended for half a year.</p>

<p>Is he now still allowed to rent and drive a rental car in the USA? He argues that the license ban is only valid in his home country and not in foreign countries, but is this really true?</p>

<p>He has still his driving license that he could show the police in USA, and I think they have no chance to check if it is banned here?</p>
","<p>Are you after the physical answer, or the legal one?</p>

<p>Presuming he still physically has his license, and it has an expiry date beyond when he will be renting the car, then he will most likely be able to physically rent a car.  If he is pulled over by the police, then he will most likely be able to lie and claim that his license is valid, and he will probably get away with it.</p>

<p>However doing that will be illegal on many levels.</p>

<p>Firstly, when renting a car, part of the rental agreement is that you have a valid drivers license and are legally allowed to drive in the country you'll be driving in.  As his license has been suspended he will NOT have a valid license, and will NOT be legally allowed to drive in the US.  Thus by renting the car he will be committing fraud.</p>

<p>Next, by actually driving, he will be driving without a license.  Most countries (including the US) allow you to drive based on having a valid license in your home country.  He does not, thus he will be driving illegally.</p>

<p>When driving without a license, any insurance coverage he has (including the rental car companies (self-)insurance, travel insurance, etc) will be invalidated. He will be fully responsible financially for any accidents he causes, and very probably even if he isn't at fault.  If he is involved in an accident you can all but guarantee that they will check on the validity of his home-country license, and not just take it for granted that it's valid.</p>

<p>If he is pulled over by a police officer it's unlikely they will be able to tell that his overseas license is suspended, but if they can then he will definitely be charged, which will not only come with a hefty fine, but will leave him in a very unfortunate position as far as returning his rental car is concerned as they will not let him drive it to return it to the rental company.</p>

<p>So can he rent a car? Yes.</p>

<p>Will he get away with it?  Probably.</p>

<p>Will he be breaking countless laws and potentially risking prison time?  YES!  (Driving without a license in California can lead to up to 6 months prison, I'm presuming other states are similar)</p>

"Cutting pain under eyebrow on plane landing","16323","","<p>Since last couple of years I've started experiencing pretty severe cutting pains in the left eyebrow region on plane landing. The strange thing is that it doesn't happen every time. I think it's like 50/50. One time it hurts like hell and the other time it's nothing at all.</p>

<p>A week ago I had it very bad on my way to a vacation. It hurt for 2 days after we landed. And on the way back it didn't hurt at all.</p>

<p>So I guess there must be some factors that affect this and some ways to prevent or at least minimize the probability and severity of the pain. I've heard that this could be related to stuffed nose. So, even though I had no noticeable cold, I tried to blow my nose when the plane started descending on the way back and that might be what helped. But it's hard to tell for sure since, as mentioned above, it didn't happen on every landing anyway. Maybe it just depends on the landing ""style"" (speed, etc.) and there's nothing I can do about it.</p>

<p>Any advice?</p>
","<p>It's probably the air pressure change causing pain from sinus pressure. Try blowing your nose before descent, and chewing gum or eating during descent.</p>

<p>Babies have a problem with this, too, although it's probably in the ears. That's why they cry during the descent.</p>

<p>I have some leftover rupees and am not planning to return to India before the deadline.  What are my options?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: The BBC has a story on this, and apparently overseas options are <em>really</em> limited: <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37938925"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37938925</a></p>
","<p>Exchange them for another currency (or denomination, if you want to and can) as soon as possible. </p>

<p>If somehow that didn't work, your only choice would be to physically send them to a friend in India. (If you have one you trust enough.) You could send it by mail or courier, using a tracking number. Your friend would then deposit them into their bank account. (And hopefully wire you something back :) ) Of course, this assumes the amount of money you have is actually significant enough for it to be worth the trouble.</p>

<p>The more time passes after this announcement, the less likely it will be that money changers are going to take them.</p>

<p>According to the announcements, Indians are being asked to deposit all these notes into their bank accounts (or change them, if it's a rather small amount) by December 31. The idea seems to be that people with a few thousand in honest cash can do this without issue, but someone with 10 million of black money can't.</p>

<p>The Indian Prime Minister <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/08/india-withdraws-500-1000-rupee-notes-fight-corruption"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">said today</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Black marketeers and traitors who use black money will not be able to
  move large amounts of money and <strong>500 and 1,000 rupee notes will become
  worthless pieces of paper.</strong> Those citizens earning honestly and with
  hard work, their interests will be protected.”</p>
  
  <p>Modi emphasised that citizens who had 500 and 1,000 rupee notes need
  not panic, as cash could be deposited at banks or post offices until
  the end of 2016. He said: “These steps are a part of our battle
  against corruption, black money and counterfeit notes. The ordinary
  citizen who is struggling, will be strengthened … There is no need for
  you to rush to the bank tomorrow, you have 50 days.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><sup>Emphasis mine.</sup></p>

<p>The effect this will have in India is that as the days pass, fewer and fewer people will want these 500 and 1000 bills anymore. Everyone who has them (provided it's a reasonable amount that won't attract the attention of tax authorities or law enforcement) will go and deposit them in their bank accounts. As we approach December 31., businesses, etc. will start dealing in lower denominations and/or the new replacement notes.</p>

<p><strong>Update, November 9th:</strong></p>

<p>This is already happening. From my local supermarket today:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HMnz9.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HMnz9.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>So, these old 500 and 1000 notes will get less and less popular as time passes, and eventually the only ones who will take them will be Indian banks. And after December 31, even the banks won't. The notes will then be mere pieces of paper.</p>

<p>It's a bit difficult to say how exactly this effect will play out with money changers abroad. But if you have a significant amount in Indian Rupees, I'd suggest you try and exchange it for another currency as soon as possible.</p>

<p>As @mts pointed out in a comment, the <a href=""http://newsite.thehindu.com/news/national/RBI-explains-Narendra-Modis-announcement-on-demonetisation-of-Rs.-500-and-Rs.-1000-notes/article16225089.ece"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">link from OP</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>People who possess Rs.500 or Rs. 1000 currency notes after December 30
  can exchange it at Reserve Bank of India by providing a declaration.
  This is till March 31, 2017.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is useful, and will probably reduce the drasticness of the effect. Even if you're going to India before March 31, though, this sounds like a rather inconvenient thing to do. Also, I'm not sure whether or not people who are not Indian citizens will be able to do this. That's speculaion, though, but in any case, I wouldn't put my money on this (literally.) I would try to change the notes as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The only US phones which can work in Europe are:</p>

<ul>

I often arrive in countries with no local cash at all, but I have a bank card where I can withdraw cash on arrival and that's no problem. If you have no cash, no credit card, and no bank card, how will you eat? Where will you sleep? They begin to suspect there is something you are not telling them.</p>

<p>On the other hand if you arrive with $10,000 in cash, that will draw attention for other reasons. They want everything you bring to make sense and match with everything you say. You're not planning to work? Then why have you brought your special tools that you use for being a welder or a hairdresser or a fashion photographer? You're just here to visit a friend? Then why have you brought all the clothes you own, family photo albums, and a collection of ""we'll miss you!"" cards from friends and family? How much money you have with you fits into that thought process as well.</p>

<p>There is an aspect of unfairness to all this, because it's not as simple as ""bring $X and you're all set."" It is a judgment call. Laws say things like ""enough money to meet your needs"" but obviously different people have different needs, and different lengths of trips, and different support from friends and family. Nothing is ever cut and dried at borders. And then there's even just the matter of whether they check. If you're well dressed and are carrying credit and debit cards along with stuff that suggests tourism, you'll be treated differently than if you look like a hippy and are carrying only one debit card and some pot smoking paraphernalia. Once you're in secondary they can check your criminal record, search the contents of computers, call the people you're visiting and so much more that they would never do at primary.

It's an overall presentation: logically, does what you are saying make sense and hang together? If not, and they decide you're arriving to work then they won't let you in. If you're wandering the world with no clear ties to some other place, they might decide you want to stay here without applying to do so, and then they won't let you in. Etc. You want to make sure you get across to them the truth of your situation, and it had better make sense.</p>

","<p>If you are a refugee, as defined by the UN convention, then no, you can't return to your home country without losing your refugee status.

<li>not a refugee yourself, but family member of a refugee, especially a minor</li>
<li>being a minor, or being in an education that ends with an official job title (Azubi)</li>
<li>various others</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>Anders als Asylbewerber, deren Verfahren noch nicht abgeschlossen sind, dürfen anerkannte Asylberechtigte, Flüchtlinge oder subsidiär Schutzberechtigte nach europäischem Recht mit diesem Aufenthaltstitel auch Auslandsreisen unternehmen.

<blockquote>
  <p>In contrast to refugee candidates, whose proceedings have not ended, accepted [refugees] according to EU laws are allowed to travel abroad. Trips to the originating country are not a reason to cancel [the status], and can only lead to revoking the protection status in special cases.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The article also says that things depend on the reason of the trip, going for a holiday is a lot more problematic than visiting a terminally ill relative.</p>

<p>So, if you have an important, urgent reason to travel home, you might be able to do so without losing your status. But check with an immigration lawyer first, and do not, under any circumstances, try to cheat the system; you'll be in a lot more trouble in case you're found out. And since authorities are closely watching potential ISIS supporters visiting middle eastern countries, it's almost impossible not to be found out. </p>

<p>Also, with the current political situation (right wing AFD gaining 15% in the elections, mostly by being anti-refugee), the government just can't afford any ""I had a great time in my home country, now returned to enjoy German social security"" reports.

"Where is the quietest place on Earth?","16159","","<p>I just wondered if there is a known ""most quiet"" place on Earth.</p>

<p>Perhaps people have measured ""ambient"" sound throughout the year in various places claimed to be the most quiet. And perhaps one has emerged as proven to be quieter than the other contenders?</p>

<p><strong>Is such a place known? And can I travel there? (-:</strong></p>

<p>I'm looking for some kind of natural place, not really a soundproof chamber in a lab. But that might also be an interesting geek travel destination I suppose, in which case there could be two right answers ...</p>
","<p>One journalist did attempt to <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140117-earths-last-place-without-noise"">research this</a> - both the artificial labs and the natural spaces.  He details it in his book - <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1416599592"">Zero Decibels</a> if you'd like to read it.</p>

<p>The highlights in nature:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Several years ago, the Campaign to Protect Rural England declared a <a href=""http://www.visitalnwick.org.uk/explore/northumberland_national_park.htm"">spot in Northumberland</a> the most tranquil place in the country (when the nearby military base isn't doing training exercises).</p></li>
<li><p>12 such quiet places exist in the US, with more found around the world. A spot in the <a href=""http://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/visiting-the-hoh.htm"">Hoh Rainforest</a> in Washington is one, as are places in <a href=""http://www.pc.gc.ca/pn-np/sk/grasslands/index.aspx"">Grasslands National Park</a> in Canada, <a href=""http://www.bwca.com/"">Boundary Waters Canoe Area</a> in Minnesota and <a href=""http://www.nps.gov/hale/index.htm"">Haleakala National Park</a> in Hawaii (see gallery). The others, however, he keeps confidential.</p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand, he identified a quiet place deep in the <a href=""http://www.cofan.org/"">Ecuadorian rainforest</a>, </p></li>
<li><p>he suspects other such places in Poland, Norway, Sweden and Finland</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Recently, <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/02/18/map-americas-quietest-places/"">a map of the USA</a> was created to show the quiet spots on a summer day. So that gives some idea for sound levels in the US. As you'd expect - away from people, cities, and wildlife tends to produce quiet, although windy areas also affect it.</p>

<p>Aside from nature, he points out the quietest places are custom built, such as the <a href=""http://www.orfieldlabs.com/researchtour4.html"">Anechoic Chamber at Orfield Labs</a>, in Minnesota.  </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20121022-the-quietest-place-on-earth"">Tours to the lab</a>:</p>

  <p>""Group tours are available a few times a year and include a brief stop

  has had so much interest in the 45-minute challenge that the founder
  Steven Orfield is considering making that option available to the
  public within the next year, and is working with the Guinness Book of
  World Records to establish an official record for the longest time
  spent in an anechoic chamber.</p>
  
  <p>The 45-minute challenge will not come cheap, however, as companies

</blockquote>



<p>I just went ahead and did the online checkin for my flight tomorrow with Etihad because I thought it might improve my chances of getting an aisle seat as I prefer.</p>

<p>But I wasn't thinking about boarding passes for some reason! Then I got a couple of screens in and was told that online boarding was complete and there were buttons to print out my boarding pass... but I'm on a netbook connected to a shopping mall free Wi-Fi and have no printer access. (Maybe I should've printed to a PDF but I didn't think of that fast enough.)</p>

<p>So I tried using my ""Ethiad Airways record locator"" code number to go back in. I found my flight details but I didn't find options to print out my boarding pass again.</p>

<p>Is there a way to print it out again from their website? Can I still get it at the airport even though I'm already checked in? Would they charge me for such a thing? What should I do?</p>
","<p>I suggest you go to the airport, and obtain your boarding passes there. </p>

<p>There are three ways you'll get them at the airport: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>If they have check-in machines, you can walk up to them and simply print the boarding pass (note: depending on how crappy the software is, you may not be able to print them - this hasn't happened to me in years, though, since the machines improved).</p></li>
<li><p>You can walk up to the baggage drop-off and ask them to print the boarding pass for you. Depending on how busy/annoying they are, they may send you to a machine, though.</p></li>
<li><p>You go to the normal check-in counter. This is guaranteed to work out fine, but may take a while, depending on how many other people are queuing.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Whatever solution you choose, remember that as soon as you get to the ""print your boarding pass"" stage, you're checked into the flight. Thus, you're on the flight according to their system (which is good if they kick people off an overbooked flight due to check-in order), which means it'll be quite a hassle for them if you didn't make it to the gate. So you're all fine.</p>

Of course this can depends on the nature of the city: Rome is not visitable in just two days while Pisa is. </p>

<p>Moreover, it is not unusual for people to ask to be hosted several times, usually at the beginning and at the end of a trip. That's what happened with some Americans I hosted when they landed in Pisa and at the end of their travel through Italy before taking the plane back.</p>

"US to Asia via Europe with infants","16036","","<p>We are planning to go on a trans-atlantic flight (> 10 hrs) with an infant. To help defray costs, we're considering just getting a ""lap"" ticket for our (would-be) 1 year old. </p>

<p>Are there airlines which are particularly good at accommodating infants? I would think these are the criteria:</p>

<ol>
<li>Shortest layovers.</li>
<li>Most legroom in Economy.</li>
<li>Accommodating, in terms of infant engagement (toys, puzzles, etc.) during the flight, seat assignments with bassinets capabilities, etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>Our Route Sector will be to fly east from the US east coast (NY or DC), via Europe, to China/India. The final destination will be contingent based on scheduling, pricing and the answer to this question ;)</p>
","<p>We did a LOT of transatlantic traveling with 3 kids (starting at 6 months age or so). My daughter had her first free flight on her own miles when she was 4 years old :-)</p>

<ol>
<li>It's entirely doable if properly prepared</li>
<li>If you need a layover, do it in Europe not the US.  Otherwise on the way back you have to go through customs and immigration in the first US airport, so basically you have to collect your luggage twice which is a royal pain, especially with a bunch of cranky and tired kids. Also it's typically shorter overall travel.</li>
<li>Good layover options are London and Dublin, since they are ""directly"" on the way</li>
<li>Another interesting option is Iceland Air via Reykjavik. It splits the whole thing into two segments which are reasonably short. On the downside, on the outbound flight it breaks in the middle of the night, which is a bummer of the rugrats are happily snoozing.</li>
<li>Make contact with the flight attendants. ""Little Joey here is just out of diapers and has a bit of a short fuse. It would be great if you give us a 20 minute advanced warning, before you block the isles"". Most attendants will be happy to help. Sometimes you get a grump.</li>
<li>I don't think the airline matters much. We've done them all (BA, US, United, Iceland, Lufthansa, Swiss, KLM, Delta, Sabena, Continental, Air France ...). Mood of passengers and crew on that particular day matter more than the letters on the airplane. That's outside of your control so go by price and convenient route.</li>
<li>Some of the really large airports in Europe (Heathrow, Charles de Gaulle, Frankfurt) can be difficult to maneuver. Zurich, Brussels, Reykjavik are much smaller. On the other hand Heathrow Terminal 1 has a really nice playground, where the kids can run around scream their head off after 8 hours on the plane.</li>
<li>Many kids get earaches from the pressure variation during start and landing. Something to chew on helps. Chewing gum, if they are old enough. Bottle or pacifier for the younger ones.</li>
<li>Most important: <strong>Have fun</strong>. It's a great family adventure and if you have a positive attitude about this, the kids will have too. If your anxious, they will smell it from 100 miles away. Bring some new games, picture books, something to draw, make up stories, find out who has the funniest hair do on the plane and get some serious snuggling done.</li>
<li>Fly mid-week. Higher chances of a flight that isn't full to the gills and you may get an empty seat next to you. </li>

"Why are airlines against the transferring of tickets to other persons?","15995","","<p>Airlines usually either don't allow the transferring of tickets to another person after they've been purchased, or they do it at an extremely inflated price. What is the reason for doing this?</p>

<p>One idea I came up with would be to allow authorities to do background checks, but one could buy a ticket at the airport shortly before the flight. Of course, it would be more expensive and there would be the risk of a fully booked plane, but it is not impossible.</p>
","<p>Airlines have a pricing strategy known as ""yield management"" or ""revenue management"" - they charge less for some seats than others, and expect these seats to be bought a long time in advance. They know that only a certain percentage of their customers are able to buy seats well in advance, and that those customers wouldn't fly if they couldn't get inexpensive seats.</p>

<p>A speculator could buy a $100 ticket and then offer it on eBay close to the flight date for $200. If more than half the seats this speculator bought were sold this way, the speculator would be making money. But the airline, which wants to sell seats close to the flight date for $500, would not. In fact very quickly the speculator enjoying selling 75% of tickets for $200 would see it fall to 0% because of another speculator selling them for $150, and then later another for $110 and so on. This is just how reselling markets tend to work.</p>

<p>By insisting that a ticket is not a commodity to be bought, traded, resold, and passed around from hand to hand, the airline is able to keep its complicated pricing structure in place. Overall, this is a good thing, because those last-minute high-price tickets cover a LOT of the cost of the flight - their existence is what keeps the long-advance-notice tickets so cheap!</p>

<p><em>Note: I'm not really bothered by the questions (except when the agent asking them is especially rude), I'm just curious.</em></p>
","<p>You are asked those things for (as far as I can tell) two reasons.  One is to simply observe your demeanor.  The idea is that someone who is concealing something will give conflicting, vague, or over-detailed answers to simple questions.</p>

<p>The other is to seek real information that can be used to distinguish smugglers from travelers.  For example, I once had the following conversation with the Border lady:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""How long was your trip?""</p>
  
  <p>""10 days.""</p>
  
  <p>""Where did you go?""</p>
  
  <p>""The Golden Triangle: northern Thailand and eastern Burma.""</p>
  
  <p>""Did you travel alone.""</p>
  
  <p>""Yes.""</p>
  
  <p>""Did you meet anyone while you were traveling?""</p>
  
  <p>""Sure, dozens of people.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Needless to say, everything I was carrying was examined minutely.  I didn't know you could disassemble a Bic pen.</p>

<p>Do you <em>have</em> to answer?  No, you can decline to answer if you're a US citizen, but think about it.</p>

<p>In general, you should be extremely reluctant to answer any questions about your own activities from law enforcement.  You might <em>think</em> you have done nothing wrong, but do you have the US Code committed to memory?  They say the average American commits <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1594035229"">three felonies a day</a>; you don't want to accidentally confess to yours.</p>

<p>But if you go through a border-check, they are going to ask you questions.  They aren't trying to incriminate innocent people; they are trying to sort out the smugglers.  If you don't answer, they have to throw you on the maybe-smuggler category and go through all your belongings.</p>

<p>So my advice:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you have done anything on your journey that might jam you up with the Feds (visited Cuba, traded with a sanctioned country) <em>but</em> your luggage is squeaky clean, decline to answer questions and let them rummage through your underwear.</li>
<li>If you were a naughty boy <em>and</em> you are bringing back a few grams of fond memories, smile politely and say, ""I just lay on the beach for two weeks.""</li>
<li>Otherwise, answer the questions politely, accurately, and concisely.</li>

"What does it mean to be in the fast lane in California?","15880","","<p>I don't think I've ever understood this. </p>

<p>I travel frequently across the State of California by car.  And I often take the highway to get to many places.</p>

<p>One thing I don't understand is how fast lanes and slow lanes work.  I was recently travelling on a fast lane near San Francisco driving at the speed limit, when I noticed a cop who was travelling behind me honk at me, presumably because I was going slowly? I noticed there was a long line of cars behind me.  </p>

<p>So I moved into the slow lane.  But even weirder is that cars in the slow lane drive at the speed limit, and cars that drive in the fast lane drive way past the speed limit, even cops.  And I have never seen anybody get arrested for going faster than the speed limit, except for really fast drivers.</p>

<p>So I don't understand, even with 6 years of driving throughout California under my belt.  I understand the fast lane is for fast cars, but doesn't driving at the speed limit constitute fast? I really don't understand.  I talked to a local officer and they said that if there are cars tailgating you or lining up behind you, you should change lanes to a slower one, but if I'm already driving at the speed limit, how can I go any faster?</p>
","<p>To <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_limits_in_the_United_States"">vastly overgeneralize</a>, most people consider posted speed limits in the United States to be too slow.  All things being equal (good weather etc), it's expected that you drive <strong>about 10 mph over the speed limit</strong>, and police <em>generally</em> ignore people who do.</p>

<p>In a few states, notably Texas, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_limits_in_the_United_States#Prima_facie"">this is enshrined in law</a>, and you can exceed the speed limit and potentially get away with it even in court as long as you can make a good case that it was ""reasonable and prudent"" to do so.  In most states, though -- and this includes California -- the letter of the law says that exceeding <strong>the posted speed limit is always illegal</strong>.</p>

<p>So what to do?  The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_curve"">Solomon curve</a> states that the safest speed to drive is at the average speed of traffic or slightly higher.  So if you're driving the speed limit, and everybody else is speeding (slightly), you're actually exposing yourself and everybody else to a greater risk of crashing.  Better to stay with the flow and speed slightly: as long as ""everybody else is doing it"", you will stay safer and most likely get away with it.  Or, if you're not comfortable doing this, then stick to the slow lane and drive the limit.</p>

"Can I fly with white powder in a transparent bag?","15864","","<p>Instead of plain old coffee, I sometimes like to get my daily caffeine ration from other drinks, e.g. fruit juice. For this purpose I have bought some pure caffeine, which takes the form of white powder.</p>

","<p>That bag would show orange color on an x-ray machine which is the color for organic material (on most machines) and it would be very obvious even between layers of clothing which are also organic but would show a different shade(powder bag would be a very dark shade of orange). If I looked at your bag for a fraction of a second I would most likely pull it out for physical inspection and then it really depends on the person who would deal with you and ask questions.</p>

<p>The amount of time you spend there really depends a lot on your profile (like it or not but that is how it works) and the answers you provide if your bag gets pulled out for further investigation.</p>

"Why is it forbidden to wear camouflage in some Caribbean Islands?","15839","","<p>In December 2013 I've been to Antigua. Before arriving there I read about the island and found a <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/antigua-and-barbuda/local-laws-and-customs"">reference</a> to a law that states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Local laws and customs</strong></p>
  
  <p>[...]</p>
  
  <p>It is an offence for anyone, including children, to dress in camouflage clothing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The source seems qualified (gov.uk). One user review in <a href=""http://www.tripadvisor.com.br/ShowUserReviews-g147242-r6843999-Antigua_Antigua_and_Barbuda.html"">TripAdvisor</a>  confirms this story, but also mentions that ""they are going to look into changing this law because of the world wide fashion trend for such garments"". A similar <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/barbados/local-laws-and-customs"">law</a> is also effective in Barbados.</p>

<p>Last year I could not confirm if this law has been revoked or not, but anyway why is (or was) it forbidden to wear camofulage in Antigua and Barbados? Is it just a coincidence that both islands were English colonies? Is this unusual (in my opinion) law effective in other countries too?</p>
","<p>The law's genesis seems to be to keep the military identifiably military and everyone else civilian. </p>

<p>As <a href=""http://antiguaobserver.com/no-unauthorised-use-of-camouflage-clothing-authorities-warn/"">reported by Theresa Gordon of the Antigua Daily Observer, on July 23, 2013</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Anyone caught wearing or selling military-type camouflage clothing
  will be arrested.</p>
  
  <p>The get-tough stance was announced by Staff Judge Advocate of the
  Antigua &amp; Barbuda Defence Force (ABDF) Orlando Michael.</p>
  
  <p>Michael said the ABDF would be working along with the police to
  enforce this provision within the law which appears to be ignored by
  many.</p>
  
  <p>He said the move is very critical and comes at at time when numerous
  victims of crime have reported being attacked by individuals dressed
  in camouflage attire.</p>
  
  <p>“Military officers will be engaged in crime prevention along with the
  police and we don’t want anyone to mistake a civilian for a milliary
  person,” Michael told state television yesterday. “This may cause
  persons to drop their guard.</p>
  
  <p>“Once we see persons who are misrepresenting the military in any
  attire, the full force of the law will be applied,” Michael added.</p>
  
  <p>According to the Defence Act 2006, it is an offence to wear, “without
  authority, any uniform or part thereof, or any article of clothing
  made from any disruptive pattern materials used for making the
  military uniform commonly called the camouflage uniform, or from any
  other material so nearly resembling any of those materials as it is
  likely to deceive.”</p>
  
  <p>The law also restricts the wearing of any uniform or part thereof worn
  by any military organisation of any other country.</p>
  
  <p>Another piece of legislation addressing the wearing and sale of such
  clothing is the Military Uniforms Act of 1997.</p>
  
  <p>It states, “No person shall import, trade, sell or deal in military
  uniforms or decorations except with the approval of the minister.”</p>
  
  <p>Any person who commits an offence under this section is liable, on
  summary conviction, to a fine of $2,000 or to imprisonment for one
  year.  </p>

"Why were holes drilled into my luggage when I entered the US?","15834","","<p>Around a month ago, I entered the US for the first time. A couple of days back, I was reorganizing stuff, and happened to notice three holes:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ybcH8.jpg"" width=""400"" alt=""three holes picture""></p>

<p>punched into the side of the bag I had used while entering the US. I don't think this was a random accident - someone bothered to open the bag (I was using a TSA ""lock"") and taped the three holes from inside the bag using some masking tape.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/H4aGg.jpg"" width=""400"" alt=""masking tape picture""></p>

<p>This was a new bag, and I'm positive that the holes weren't there when I bought it. Has anyone heard of such a thing happening? Why would the TSA/CBP/other agency drill holes into the bag, when they could've simply opened it? (They could clearly open it since they taped the holes from the inside.) Could they've been inspecting the lining or something?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: @Harper mentioned a possible scenario of the logo of the bag getting broken by the baggage handlers.  Yes, there was indeed a logo there, and now it's missing. So I guess this is not CBP/TSA's handiwork after all.</p>
","<p>The three holes are <em>perfectly</em> spaced, and too clean/consistent on both sides to be a rush job with a handheld drill.  The dimples on the bottom suggest to me they were <em>punched</em> on a specially made jig. </p>

<p>Look close at the photo and you can see the vestiges of a rectangle around all three holes, making about a 2-hole-width margin around the holes. The rectangle is either a discoloration or a dimpling on the surface.  Very subtle. </p>

<p>My guess is, a handle, fitting, logo, bumper, etc. went there.  </p>

<p>TSA or baggage handlers broke it off by accident, and asked TSA to try to fix it (since they could get inside the luggage to reach the screws). Or alternately, TSA was looking for concealed contraband, chose to disassemble the piece that goes there, and either didn't care, lost the screws, or didn't want to take the time to reassemble it due to workload. Perhaps the part+screws is in a ziploc bag tucked into a pocket you didn't check.</p>

"How to avoid drinking vodka?","15685","","<p>This summer, I spent some time in Moscow and St. Petersburg; I also visited a friend and his family. Their custom was to drink a lot of vodka during the meal. We, the guests, also had to drink some vodka; but obviously we'd had enough before our Russian friends. ;) But it was very difficult for us to convince them that it would be unwise for us to drink more vodka. I think, in fact, that we slightly offended them.</p>

<p>If I'm invited to a meal with my hosts, how can I avoid drinking a lot of vodka without offending them? I think it wouldn't be too difficult if I didn't drink at all. Then I could say that I don't drink for religious or medical reasons. But what excuse could I use if I've already started drinking and want to stop?</p>
","<p>In Bulgaria, Russia, former USSR countries and others, it's considered offensive not to drink when you've been invited to, and you might need a good solid excuse if you decide not to drink at all. Expect to be on the receiving end of some good-natured banter if you decide to abstain completely.</p>

<p>Medical reasons are a possibility, although it will be difficult to refuse to drink at least once with your hosts, regardless of your (supposed or actual) ailment.</p>

<p>But if you decide to drink with the best of them, then you are expected to do so each and every time a toast is raised -- which can get you down pretty quickly if you are not a serious drinker.</p>

<p>What you can do is just <em>pretend</em> to drink from your glass after every toast -- you don't have to shove the whole 100 g down your throat every time. Just take a little sip (maybe a little bit more in the beginning), and after the first few rounds the hosts and their guests will be in too cheerful a mood to notice you're not keeping up volume-wise. </p>

<p>Your glass will be helpfully refilled by someone sitting close to you when getting below one-third or so, so just don't empty it as quickly. There's always more where that came from. </p>

<p>There's a whole culture of proper drinking in Eastern Europe, so here are some generic drinking tips that will help you a lot if you are drinking only occasionally: </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Don't drink too fast</strong>, even if you don't feel you're getting drunk -- you will, and it will happen without warning. Take it easy </li>
<li><strong>Drink water.</strong> I can't stress this enough. As much as possible, really, and all the time -- but not fizzy drinks. You'll be able to keep up with your hosts longer, and largely avoid that pesky hangover in the morning, which is caused by dehydration.</li>
<li><strong>Excuse yourself (temporarily)</strong>.  If you feel you're getting in trouble, skimp on the vodka for some time. If asked, explain you are feeling a little bit dizzy, and want to take a break for a while <em>so that you can resume drinking later</em>. Everybody will most likely smile in understanding, and won't press you to drink for some time. Use the grace period to restock on dehydrants and food, because it won't last forever.</li>
<li><strong>Eat.</strong> Traditional Russian dishes that go with vodka are there to prevent you from getting drunk quickly. Pickles, smoked salmon, fatty meats -- they all help. Be sure to have something in your stomach before you start drinking, and keep up at a steady rate throughout the evening.</li>
<li><strong>Talk.</strong> Engage in a conversation with your neighbours on the table. If it's interesting enough, they'll forget to sip and toast as often. If conversations are not going well, there's not much to do on the table besides drinking -- and that's bad news for you.</li>
</ul>

<p>Good luck, and Наздраве!</p>

"Can I be refused entry due to my place of birth?","15672","","<p>Usually entry requirements are based on country of citizenship, but is it at all possible to be denied entry if you were born in a country in conflict with your travel destination ?</p>

<p>This is a specific question that I'm trying to make more general. In my case, I was born in Beirut but am Canadian citizen, always lived here. Not to get into details but technically speaking, Lebanon considers itself at war with Israel, and relations are always tense there.
I would really like to visit Israel one day, but I'm wondering if I can be denied entry because my (Canadian) passport says I was born in Lebanon? </p>

<p>I was speaking with an Israeli-Canadian friend and he also thinks that he would never be allowed into Lebanon because he was born in Tel Aviv.</p>
","<p>You have the right to <a href=""http://www.ppt.gc.ca/form/pdfs/pptc077-eng.pdf"">ask</a> for a Canadian passport that does not show your place of birth. This implies that having it in your passport may cause problems in some cases. The disclaimers on that page further suggest that not having it in your passport may cause problems, too.</p>

<p>To quote from <a href=""http://www.ppt.gc.ca/info/section1.aspx?lang=eng"">their info page</a>:</p>

<p>You may request that your place of birth does not appear in the passport. However, if you chose to do so, note that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Place of birth is mandatory for entry to some countries. You should contact the consulate or embassy of every country you plan to visit to ensure that you will be allowed entry if your passport does not indicate your place of birth. </li>
<li>You may have difficulty obtaining a visa. </li>
<li>You may experience delays at border crossings. </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Wikipedia also <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_passport"">claims</a>:</p>

<p>The People's Republic of China will not issue visas to Canadian passport holders whose place of birth is inscribed as being Hong Kong HKG, Macau MAC or (city name) TWN. Accordingly, passports issued to Canadians born in Hong Kong, Macau or Taiwan now only list the place of birth, without an accompanying three-letter country code, unless upon request.</p>

<p>... and ...</p>

<p>Canadian citizens born in Jerusalem have their birthplace identified only by the city's name, with no national designation, due to the unresolved legal status of Jerusalem.</p>

"Dealing with the 'unclean hand' when travelling (if you're left-handed)","15669","","<blockquote>
  <p>""Among Muslims, the left hand is reserved for bodily hygiene and
  considered unclean. Thus, the right hand should be used for eating.
  Shaking hands or handing over an item with one's left hand is
  considered an insult.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A common enough sentence in many guide books and on Wikipedia.  However, being left-handed it's quite often very unnatural - you reach for food with your dominant hand, pass something with that hand, and ironically the right hand is often the one used for bodily hygiene among left-handers.</p>

<p>Indeed, in Uzbekistan I picked up an apple with my left hand to the horror of the locals I was with on a train ride, at which point one of them who didn't speak English graphically demonstrated that right hand is for eating and left hand is for ... elsewhere.</p>

<p>So, if you're left-handed, how do you deal with it? Tie a string around your hand? Just lots of practice? Or do you just not care, even if their insistence on the right hand can result in them unknowingly getting a hand that is the very one they were trying to avoid?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette_in_the_Middle_East"">Source of the quote</a></p>
","<p>I just try to make a conscious effort to use only my right hand for most things when I'm in public places - paying for transportation fare or items in a market, eating in public restaurants, even pushing doors open. If you're mindful enough, you should be able to manage most of the time; if you forget once in a while, just correct yourself as soon as your realize what you're doing. I've never had anyone get seriously (at least, seriously in a way that was visible to me) upset with me if I accidentally used the wrong hand. A little bit of tension, but outrage is pretty rare in my experience. Still, I'd rather be ungraceful than rude. :)</p>

<p>It really is just practice, I think. I find it incredibly awkward to eat (with silverware or with my hands) using only or primarily my right hand, but a few years ago I spent a few months in India, and about halfway through I realized it was coming much more naturally. I didn't have to think about which hand I was using, and the coordination of performing those tasks was requiring less active thought. Still a little strange, and it sometimes extended mealtimes, but it got better.</p>

","<p>I'm going to answer this to cover two aspects - social media accounts for visas, and social media access AT the border, since they're related and will probably be asked as well.</p>

<p>Currently for some visas, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/26/us-customs-social-media-foreign-travelers"" rel=""noreferrer"">you're now asked for your social media accounts</a> as a foreign  traveller to the US.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The US government has begun asking select foreign travelers to
  disclose their social media activities as part of an expanded effort
  to spot potential terrorist threats.</p>
  
  <p>The request functions as a prompt on the online Electronic System for
  Travel Authorization, or Esta, a visa waiver application that many
  visitors are required to submit before travelling to the US. The
  choices include platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+,
  Instagram, LinkedIn and YouTube, and additional space for applicants
  to input their account names on those sites.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, obviously not every person has a social media account (including members of my family).  </p>

<p>The CBP has stated:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>it wouldn’t prohibit entry to foreigners who didn’t provide their
  social media account information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's a weird request.  In theory if they find someone suspicious, they could use their social media to look up more info about them.  Equally, it could help clear them.  However, much like some of the other questions (are you a member of a terrorist organisation), it's unlikely any 'problem person' is going to volunteer their social media accounts.  However, others feel insecure if they don't complete a full visa application, and the information may be used for other things, like cross referencing with other govt organisations wondering who the followers of x are, or who is tweeting from y.</p>

<p>However, that's speculation. The key answer to your question, again - for now, is:</p>

<p><strong>it wouldn’t prohibit entry to foreigners who didn’t provide their social media account information.</strong> </p>

<p>Similarly, if they ask you for your actual login credentials (eg password), and you say you don't have one, it can't be held against you.  However, if YOU did have one and said you didn't, and it was later found to be a lie, then you've lied to a government official, and THAT can be held against you.</p>

What punishment would I get?</p>
","<p>You are asking the wrong question.</p>

<p>Finding uninhabiteds island is not a problem, there are countless ones in Oceania or the Caribbean.</p>

<p><em>Marooning</em> was the term of leaving someone on an uninhabited island and it was considered a capital punishment.</p>

<p>The reason is simple: What do you want to do there what you cannot do with a big yacht or a house on a inhabitated island ? You have already the precondition that you have enough money. With a big yacht you can travel everywhere, replenish stocks and do what you please. A house on an inhabited island gives you social life to enjoy.</p>

<p>Living on an island grows stale very quickly. Most uninhabited islands are for a reason uninhabited: They cannot sustain life for one or several persons, so replenishment of stocks and therefore contact with the outer world are a necessity. If you cannot avoid contact why living on an island (instead on a yacht or house of an inhabited island) in the first place ?</p>

<p>What about friends ? They may find it cool to party some time, but sooner or later a
problem occurs: <em>Cabin fever</em>. Every time a group is isolated and have no possibility to withdraw, it causes irritation and finally aggression.</p>

<p>Anyway, all islands are under a jurisdiction. While officials may never find out what you are doing, once they know they can forcibly evict and punish you. And the law also applies for everything you have done, so no room for misbehavior.  <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/users/22889/cpast"">User cpast</a> provided in the comments an example:<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minerva_Reefs#Republic_of_Minerva"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The attempt to elevate the unoccupied Minerva Reefs near Tonga to an own nation</a>.

","<p>Hmm... Technically, I suppose all of these answers are somewhat opinion-based, but I would personally plan a bit longer than 1.5 hrs for a layover to an international flight at ATL. I usually try to plan at least that long even for domestic layovers there. While Michael is correct that, if you did miss your flight, they would put you on the next available flight to your destination since you booked a single ticket, if you'd rather avoid that possibility, I'd personally advise planning a bit longer than 1.5 hours between flights. Keep in mind that the times listed for the flights are not including the time required to deplane and board the next flight, so even if you have a 50 minute layover scheduled, your departing flight is likely already boarding by the time you step off your arriving flight, even if it's on time. It's definitely possible that you'll make the 1.5 hr connection here, but it's also possible to miss it, especially if your inbound flight is delayed for some reason.</p>

<p>As far as the 'plane train' is concerned (that's what they call the light rail you mentioned,) <a href=""http://www.atlanta-airport.com/docs/terminal/f.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">this map</a> does seem to suggest that it connects to concourse F. Note that international flights in Atlanta can depart from either Concourse F (which is directly attached to the new international terminal) or Concourse E (which housed all of the international flights prior to the new terminal.) As far as I know, the plane train connects to both, though.</p>

"Is it possible for tourists to enter/attend Japanese Game Shows?","15467","","<p>A group of us are looking at a trip to Japan later this year. Joking lead to wondering about visiting a game show, watching one, and then the hypothetical 'can you even go enter one?' question.</p>

<p>So - is there a way to enter a game show, or at the least, be in the audience?</p>
","<p>While I cannot pinpoint a specific show that sells tickets online to foreigners, I would like to give you a bit of background about what issues there are to join such shows in general. I hope this will give you a perspective and some pointers for what to look for specifically.</p>

<p><strong>Participation</strong></p>

<p>There are often foreigners participating in Japanese TV shows. One thing also to be considered is that participants in many Japanese TV shows are comedians or otherwise media-related people. If you switch on the TV, the majority of the shows that you will see are run like that. So the number of shows that would allow ""random"" people to participate is relatively small compared to western media.</p>

<p>On top of that, most shows on Japanese TV can be categorized in these classes: </p>

<ul>
<li>Music shows</li>
<li>Variety shows. Those are built around people who contribute actual content, be it from their own expertise or (semi-) celebrities who present pre-prepared content. Topics mostly cover fashion/food and odd/interesting stuff from Japan and around the world.</li>
<li>Comedy shows with comedians and special guests, often combining the two above</li>
<li>Game shows with random participants (the most famous abroad being <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeshi%27s_Castle"">Takeshi's castle</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The issue is that in most shows there is a lot of talking and without speaking Japanese it would be quite difficult to participate in any meaningful way.</p>

<p>For foreign participants, there are generally two types: </p>

<ul>
<li>Celebrities who do not speak Japanese but are there only because they are famous in Japan. I guess they are paid to be there, and I think we can skip this here.</li>
<li>Foreigners who do something special, and in most cases speak Japanese VERY well. I am quite sure that they are booked by Japanese PR companies or are there to contribute to the content of the show. Not speaking Japanese and not having anything entertainmentwise to contribute to the show would be quite a big issue if you want to participate.</li>
</ul>

<p>So as a participant, I would say chances are quite small. You might have higher chances if you go out of Tokyo and try with smaller TV stations in regions like Hokkaido or even Okinawa, but if you specifically want to do so in Tokyo, it will be much harder, simply because they need high quality content for entertainment rather than foreigners who ""just happened to pass by"" but cannot actively contribute content.</p>

<p><strong>Audience</strong></p>

<p>First of all, I have never seen foreigners in an audience on Japanese TV. On top of that, there is rarely a chance for random people to be part of it. Exceptions are large-stage music programs where tickets are sold like concert tickets. This is because the size of the audience in Japanese shows is often quite small and comes across as hand-picked. So often, the type of audience is highly controlled by the TV station. If you do not fit the target demographic, you will not be let in. The result of this is that you will just not have the possibility of finding a link on the TV station website that says ""Tickets for our live shows here!"". (The same is true for most US stations) You have to find a show that you like, that you will fit in as a target audience and then try to find a ticket for it. In the US, normally you can however apply or line up for a ticket directly. In Japan, it's often a two-step process: You have to first apply via postcard for a membership at the TV station's club (<a href=""https://pid.nhk.or.jp/pid02/receipt/info.do"">such as at NHK</a>), and THEN apply for a ticket through the membership account. There will be a lottery among all participants to get tickets. All in Japanese of course, and you will need an address in Japan to register.</p>

<p>So as a summary, if you are going to Japan at a specific date and try to get tickets for something recorded in Tokyo beforehand without speaking Japanese, it will be very difficult unless someone here can point you to a specific show that would fit these requirements and help you with the whole application process, too.</p>

<p><strong>Additional Issues</strong></p>

<p>An additional note about the challenges with being a foreigner: Even if you speak Japanese fluently, bear in mind that any coordination that needs to be done with you is a big challenge, which is of course the biggest issue if you want to participate in a show rather than just being in the audience. In a company (such as a TV company) which is not used to frequently dealing with foreigners, the staff will not even be able to call you unless you have a Japanese phone number because international calls are normally blocked on their phones. Internet sites often require addresses, local phone numbers etc to register. If you do not speak Japanese, finding someone who speaks English is a huge challenge. Therefore, since you are trying to do something that normally only locals would do, you might have the biggest chances of succeeding if you have a Japanese local intermediary like a travel agent or a friend there to help you.</p>

<p>I would also exclude Talent shows and the like (see comments below). The coordination with you over phone, in Japanese and the fact that you would have to go to auditions and (assuming you do not get kicked out in the first show) subsequent shows would fall out of reach because of the reasons above. I would also strongly assume that those shows require interviews and are highly geared towards local Japanese talents instead of tourists/foreigners. I know of foreigners competing in local tournaments, but I am quite certain that the Tokyo marathon has different requirements in that sense than ""Japan's got talent"".</p>

"Can I see which seats are available on a British Airways flight before I book?","15464","","<p>Some airlines (for example, <a href=""http://www.aa.com/seatmap/viewSeatsAccess.do"">American Airlines do this</a>) offer a seat availability checker so you can see which seats are currently booked on a flight - there are limitations, since some seats might show as occupied but are actually reserved for priority customers - but it's still useful.</p>

<p>Is there any way of getting this kind of live seat booking data for British Airways <strong>before</strong> you have booked a flight? This would help me select which of several flights I might pick (for example, where I might be able to select a better seat, or where the plane is lightly loaded).</p>
","<p>Yes, but it's a bit fiddly. </p>

<p>If, when you are booking, you are either logged in with a BAEC Silver or Gold membership active (BAEC silver and gold get seat selection for free at the time of booking), or you are doing a (not logged in) search for a fully flexible ticket (full fare tickets get free seat selection at the time of booking), then almost at the end of the booking process before entering your credit card details, it lets you pick a seat:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hUrMF.png"" alt=""BA seat picker""></p>

<p>At that point, bring up the seat selection tool, and see how many seats are free on that flight. If not enough, go back and pick a different flight. If so, go back and pick the fare class you really wanted to book on. Expect to take a minute or two per flight you check, by the time you get to that bit of the booking!</p>

<p>Remember that this will only show if you're doing a search when logged in as a BAEC Silver or Gold (other BAEC tiers or other OneWorld status won't work during the booking process), or when doing a fully-flexible search when not logged in.</p>

<p>Otherwise, some travel agents can look it up, and they can also look up how busy the flight is in a general sense (how many tickets for sale in each cabin in each fare class). If you care, it might be easier to get a good travel agent, ring them up, have them look at the loadings then book you onto the flight with the loading / seats you're after.</p>

"How does the US know that I left?","15436","","<p>Every time I leave Australia, I have to fill in an official form that the government collects to state that I've left the country.</p>

<p>However, when I left the US last week (after my first visit there), at no stage did anyone official verify that I was leaving the country. I checked in at the QANTAS desk at JFK and passed through TSA security there, and that's it. I got on a plane to LAX and then from LAX I didn't go through any checkpoints, and left the country. No immigration, no nothing.</p>

<p>Does the US government know that I've left the country?</p>
","<p>Yes, they almost certainly do know you've left. The US processes passport details for all air passengers through a system called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Passenger_Information_System"">APIS</a>, and ties that to the electronic I-94 (arrival and departure record).</p>

"New H1B arrival, what do I need for the port of entry?","15415","","<p>I just got my newly-approved H1B visa stamped into my (UK) passport and am flying to America in a week. Besides my stamped passport, and my I-797B (Notice of Action) document, is there any other documentation I should bring, or questions I should be prepared for? Is it worth carrying a copy of my employment contract or any of the petition paperwork? I'm within the validity dates of the approval notice. I just don't know what to expect at the port of entry!</p>
","<p>Your passport and visa (and I-94, see below) should, on theory, be sufficient. Also, you should know the address of the place you'll be staying when you arrive, and the name of your employer and what kind of work you'll be doing. </p>

<p>However, definitely bring all key paperwork with you in your carry-on luggage, for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>This is important stuff that you may need in the future - either because you have to produce it or because you want to be consistent in how you fill out forms. You do not want these documents to travel to Hawaii instead and stay there.</p></li>
<li><p>In case there's anything wrong with your documents (I had an official signature missing once, I've seen people mis-entered into the system), it's very important that you can demonstrate that you did everything right and that you are fully documented. In principle they can reject you regardless of whose fault it was that your paperwork got messed up, but the will be much more lenient if they realize that you're just some poor schmuck failed by the system.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Otherwise, just relax, smile, and go to the bathroom <em>before</em> standing in line. Be polite, accept that they're always right, and trust that you're one of the many, many people who enter the US without any problems.</p>

<p><em>EDIT</em> Please note that even if you have signed up for ESTA (which means that you don't need to fill out the green I-94 form), you have to fill out the <em>white</em> I-94 for visa holders, since you're entering with a work visa, rather than under a tourist visa waiver program! The I-94 will be distributed during the flight. If it's the first time you fill out such a form, ask the Flight Attendant for two copies :)</p>

"Where can I buy US prepaid credit card outside US?","15402","","<p>I am thinking about going to the US and to reduce the amount of cash I carry, I plan to use a prepaid credit card for as many transactions as possible (i.e. gas, store purchases, etc.)</p>

<p>I have a few questions on this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is there anyway I can get a US prepaid debit card outside the US (preferably online)? </li>
<li>Are they issued by US banks, or Visa/Mastercard companies, or who issues them? </li>
<li>Is there anywhere online where I can register those cards with a US billing address, so that I can print statements if I want to?</li>
<li>Is it possible to obtain a virtual prepaid card (i.e. I receive just 16 digits card number and a CVV)? Would that be usable on brick-and-mortar store purchases?</li>
</ol>
","<p>I've used a lot of these cards almost since they were introduced to the market over a decade ago, so I'm drawing on my experience here (technical corrections are welcome):</p>

<hr>

<p>Prepaid debit cards in the US come in two major classes: reloadable and non-reloadable.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Non-reloadable cards are purchased with a fixed amount of U.S. dollars on the card, and cannot be topped up. Once they are empty, they can be discarded. These are often sold as ""gift cards"", do not require an ID check, and can be found in most grocery stores, drugstores, shopping malls, etc. They generally have a flat fee for purchase of the card, and usually no other fees. The highest denomination I have ever seen for these is $1000, though I believe the law allows for them to have up to $3000. Most are in the $25-$100 range, though higher denominations can be found with some shopping.</p>

<p>You will receive a card immediately at the point of purchase, usually with the name of GIFT CARD or something similar. This once caused one cashier to glance at the receipt as I was finishing my purchase and tell me ""Thanks for coming in today, Mr. Gift.""</p></li>
<li><p>Reloadable cards are purchased with an arbitrary amount of money loaded on the card, and can be topped up at any time. These typically carry monthly fees, top-up fees, and sometimes transaction fees. They also require an ID check, and the issuer may restrict issuance to US residents. (Thanks, PATRIOT act!) They can be loaded with up to $3000 at any given time, though the issuing bank may have a lower limit.</p>

<p>Reloadable cards may have to be mailed to you at a US address; you do not typically get the card at point of purchase, though you may get a temporary card. The card you receive in the mail will have your name on it, and it generally takes about a week or two to arrive.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>As far as I know, neither type can be obtained from outside the US; you must obtain them in person at a point of purchase.</p>

<p>Both types of cards will have a web site where you can register the card and associate a physical address in the US with it for the purpose of online shopping. The web site will also show the activity on the card and its current balance. For reloadable cards, the registration is mandatory and you will do it as part of the process of purchasing the cards. For non-reloadable gift cards, it is optional, and only needed if you wish to use the card to make online purchases.</p>

<p>(And those virtual cards you mention are only usable online; they cannot be used in physical stores.)</p>

<p>Which type is better for you, I think only you can say. But I would think that a high-value non-reloadable card or two would be the way you would want to go here. My favorite place to get them is at shopping malls; the mall customer service desk will sell them, generally in denominations up to $250 or $500 depending on the mall, usually for a fee of about $5.</p>

<p>Finally, a usage note: When your card gets near empty, you can instruct a merchant to charge the exact amount remaining on the card, and then pay the remaining balance via another payment method, as long as you aren't doing this at a restaurant, hotel or possibly gas station (since these places may authorize an amount higher than the amount given and settle the exact amount a few days later). This allows you to empty out the card and not lose any money.</p>

<hr>

<p>You might also consider just using your own credit cards while in the US; if they have a magnetic stripe and are Visa, MasterCard, American Express, etc., they should work in most places in the US except for ""pay at the pump"" gas station pumps (<a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/q/11594/3221"">pay inside the store instead</a>). You'll usually get a good exchange rate, too, though this does seem to vary a lot by country and bank. Note that Maestro cards do not generally work for purchases here, though they work at most ATMs.</p>

","<p>Fortunately one fan <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/30/travel/chasing-kurt-cobain-in-washington-state.html"">wrote up such a tour idea for the NY Times</a>.</p>

<p>To summarise, he started by staying at the Marco Polo, a motel where Cobain used to get his heroin nearby, and shoot up in room 226.</p>

<p>413 Fleet Street South is a noted spot next, as the house Cobain lived in with his father for several years in the late 70s / early 80s.</p>

<p>He drives to Aberdeen (town slogan: ""Come as you are"") (they claim him instead of Seattle), then on to 1210 East First Street (in the Felony Flats - another abode of Cobain's while growing up).</p>

<p>The Aberdeen museum has a statue of Cobain as well.</p>

<p>Aberdeen’s must-see Cobain site is a small park, opened in 2011 by the Kurt Cobain Memorial Foundation, called Kurt Cobain Landing.</p>

<p>There's also several other places where he used to live (address not mentioned), including Dale Crover’s porch, at 609 West Second Street.</p>

<p>He goes to 'The Central' but like many bars of the era, they've changed crowds, styles and music, like 'The Crocodile', the 'OK Hotel', Beehive Records (now a pet store), and Linda's Tavern where Cobain was last seen alive.</p>

<p>As I finish summarising, I realise that the article is actually a bit of a gold mine, because it finishes by listing all the addresses of the places mentioned above, which should help you a lot in planning and locating some of the old haunts.</p>

"Pricing and booking mixed-class fares, with economy & premium economy combined?","15369","","<p>So I find myself flying mixed-class fares pretty often these days, with the long legs in Premium Economy and the short hauls in plain old Economy.  Some sample trips flown or planned:</p>

<ol>
<li>SYD-AKL-SFO (NZ), with SYD-AKL in Economy and AKL-SFO in Prem Econ</li>
<li>SYD-SFO-LAS (UA), with SYD-SFO in Economy Plus and SFO-LAS in Economy</li>
<li>ZRH-DXB-SYD (EK/QF), with ZRH-DXB in EK Economy and DXB-SYD in QF Prem Eco</li>
</ol>

<p>Problem is, none of the booking engines I know handle this.  For example, if I select ""Premium Economy"" in my usual favorite, <a href=""http://matrix.itasoftware.com/"">ITA Matrix</a>, it interprets this as ""must fly in prem eco <em>or better</em>"" and thus doesn't find #1 at all, instead offering $9,000 fares via Hong Kong or something (because there's no Prem Eco for SYD-AKL), and for #2 it quotes me SFO-LAS in First.  None of the airline sites listed above seem to cater to this either, except -- oddly enough -- for award redemptions.  I usually end up getting quotes for plain old economy and asking actual human travel agents how much an upgrade would cost, but this is slow and inconvenient for everybody involved.</p>

<p><strong>So is there a booking engine that lets me specify ""fly in premium economy if you can, but economy if not""?</strong></p>
","<p>The closest I have seen to what you are looking for is through Kayak. Based on certain criteria that it determines, tickets with multiple legs can have different booking classes.</p>

"Why does a passport have a place of birth field on it?","15354","","<p>Almost all passports I have seen have a place of birth field on them. For instance, on the US Passport,</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/mldwnl.jpg"" alt=""EP Test Sample US Passport""></p>

<p>Is there a specific reason to this?</p>
","<p>An immediate reason is that some international norms recommend it but they do not mandate it (the ICAO coordinates this at an international level, see comments for more detail). <a href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:41981X0919%3aEN%3aHTML"">EU passports must also mention it</a>. A more general reason for ID of any kind to have a date of birth and place of birth is to be able to distinguish people with the same name (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_of_birth"">Wikipedia has more details on this</a>).</p>

<p>But possibly the most important reason is that in many countries, your place of birth would also have a register that would include a note of your birth and, eventually, of your death so you can always come back to that register to verify that someone is not trying to use a made-up identity or a dead's person identity. Before computer databases, it was the main mechanism to maintain and access this information.</p>

<p>Incidentally, I believe the Swiss passport does not have a “place of birth” but a “place of origin” (<em>Heimatort</em> or <em>Lieu d'origine</em>), which is the place your family comes from and can be transmitted from one generation to the next even if you never lived there.</p>

"How to book a flight if my passport doesn't state my gender?","15258","","<p>I am asking on behalf of my friend.</p>

<p>My friend doesn't have a gender (in other words they are gender-neutral) and on their new passport their gender is represented as X (indeterminate/unspecified). Previously booking a flight wasn't an issue because their previous passports stated they were a woman.</p>

<p>The problem is every time you book a flight you need to choose from 2 genders. Now they will be travelling from Sweden to Russia but the question applies to their future flights too, anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>What gender should a person who is not cisgender choose when booking a flight? Does it depend on a flight operator or flight destination?</p>
","<p>The number of people without a gender is extremely small and therefore even the most progressive countries <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/31368/why-is-sex-gender-present-in-eu-issued-passports"">still issue passports with a gender field</a>. Airlines have even less incentive to accommodate 'unusual' people and therefore put traditional gender options into the booking details.</p>

<p>What your friend should do is <strong>pick whatever gender they like</strong> and <strong>simply fly as usual</strong>. If neither gender is preferable, they should pick the value that resembles their external features the most, e.g. female for long hair and soft features or male for short hair and a beard.</p>

<p>If confronted about the mismatch, simply point out that their website doesn't provide an X gender option and therefore your booking is in fact valid. Most gate agents only check passports to <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/a/79677/9009"">verify the name and visa</a>, so it's unlikely the mismatch would come up anyway. Nothing in the airlines' Terms and Conditions forbids gender-less people from flying, so you should be fine.</p>

<p>If you'd like to promote the availability of the X option, I'd still write a polite email to the airline explaining your conundrum. If enough people point it out, they might get around to modifying their booking systems.</p>

<hr>

<p>Dear Inquirer</p>

<p>Schengen visas are accepted in conjunction with a valid travel document for entry into Switzerland. If not otherwise noted, the Schengen visa is valid for all Schengen member states. </p>

<p>While your Norwegian schengen visa is thus acceptable for entry into Switzerland you may be questioned at the border because you have not used it before and have no intention of visiting Norway. </p>

<p>We therefore suggest to you to take with you any documentation to prove that you have tried to apply for a new Swiss schengen visa but were not able to get one because it is not possible to hold more than one valid schengen visa at a time ( e.g. a printout of this email conversation and your application to the Swiss embassy). Further it might be helpful to take your UK residency permit with you, for further proof that you are a legal resident of the European Union and to dispel any doubts at the border about possible visa fraud.</p>

"What is a ""Partially open bathroom""?","15174","","<p>I was browsing London hotels on hotels.com and noticed that many, in the room information section, said they had ""partially open bathrooms"".

<p>Also, if I could, would you recommend it? (in regards to additional fees or anything) </p>
","<p>Credit cards are definitely NOT widely accepted in Japan.  It was slightly better than I'd heard - I'd heard not at all, but I went last year (including Osaka).</p>

<p>Essentially, it was easiest to take some cash (As much as you're willing to have on your person), and then go to either a post office or 7-Eleven shops - they have ATMs that allow you to use foreign credit cards or debit cards, including American Express (Source: personal experience, and <a href=""http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2208.html"">another source online</a>).</p>

<p>I found that the most convenient, I just accept the fees and get a decent chunk out at the time, while my travelling friends exchanged a much larger amount in Australia and brought the cash with them.</p>

<p>Each to their own. I dislike having large sums of cash on me :/  Note that several banks allow you to get fee-free cards for travel.  I also used the Qantas Cash credit card - it's a Visa card, but allows you to pre-load it with foreign currencies (like yen) and then draw on that (earning airpoints at the same time).</p>

"Kicked out of hotel in morning when booking through booking agency (asked to pay for extra day)","15108","","<p>I am from UK, I went to travel agent website and booked holiday (flights + hotel), today is the last day and my flight is 22:30. In the morning we went to the city to have some lunch and when we came back we were asked to pay for one extra day because hotel policy is to check out at 11:00 and our travel agency didn't book one extra day. I tried to explain to them that I didn't make booking directly and all should have been done between travel agency hotel and not me, but in the end just to get to my stuff that I have left in my room I paid for extra one day. I then called agency I have booked with, they said however that I should have booked for one more day If I wanted to stay till the evening (although I used their system to make the booking and didn't get explanation that I have to wait one day on the street), and if I want I should contact their complaints department.</p>

<p><strong>Is this legal? What recourse could I take?</strong> </p>
","<p>This is not only completely legal, it's how all hotels work.</p>

<p>They have a published check-out time, which will vary between hotels but is usually somewhere between 10am and 1pm.</p>

<p>if you wish to stay longer, you need to request either a late checkout (which may be free, or may be charged, depending on a number of factors), or pay for an extra night.</p>

<p>In my experience, most travelers who have a 10:30pm flight will either request a late checkout, and/or they will simply check-out and leave their bags in storage at the hotel until later in the day.  Of course that's not to say that there's anything wrong with booking an extra night, but it is not the norm, and is not what a travel booking website(!) would do by default.</p>

<p>For example, only a few days ago I had a 12:30am (ie, just after midnight) flight.  My hotel was able to extend my check-out time until 4pm, after which I left my bags at the hotel and went shopping.  I returned around 9pm, collected my bags, and headed to the airport - all for no extra charge!</p>

"Why do consulates take away your passport to issue the visa?","15108","","<p>As far as my passport is concerned, a visa is a (very fancy) sticker.</p>

<p>Why is it that consulates actually take away your passport and give it back with the visa on it?</p>

<p>Why not just examine your passport, issue the visa, let you keep the passport, and have you come back so that they can stick the visa onto the passport? Why do they need it in between?</p>
","<p>I can answer this for the UK and Schengen members...</p>

<p>In the first instance, consulates take your passport because there are <a href=""http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2000/0110990390/contents"" rel=""noreferrer"">some laws involving how a visa</a> is issued.  Prominent among those are...</p>

<p>Paragraph 24, which states...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The following must produce to the Immigration Officer a valid passport
  or other identity document endorsed with a United Kingdom entry
  clearance issued to him for the purpose for which he seeks entry:...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Paragraph 27, which states...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An application for entry clearance is to be decided in the light of
  the circumstances existing at the time of the decision...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Paragraph 28, which states...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An applicant for an entry clearance must be outside the United Kingdom
  and Islands at the time of the application...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(These rules are all found at <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-part-1-leave-to-enter-or-stay-in-the-uk"" rel=""noreferrer"">Immigration Rules</a>)</p>

<p>From these it's clear that they need to take possession of the travel document in order to assess its validity. And from Paragraphs 27 and 28 they need to be sure that the conditions of issuance are 'fixed' to a specific date and time.  It means that the applicant has not travelled with the passport in the interval between submission and issuance, and (to the extent possible) the applicant is not in the UK when the decision is made.  In addition, the Entry Clearance Officer has to assess the application. These things cannot be done 'while-you-wait' and holding the passport helps to guarantee that Paragraphs 24, 27, and 28 are diligently observed.</p>

<p>There are some practical and administrative considerations that come into play...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Those visa stickers are affixed to the passport page by a machine and
there's usually one machine per post. The passports need to be
sequenced, fed in to the machine, and then checked by a human. This
is done as a background task by local hires who may be on shift work
in a <em>batch</em>. Trying to arrange a batch according to whoever showed
up is administratively impractical.</p></li>
<li><p>In the UK case, they don't like people hanging around the consulate,
they like to make the decision entirely by paper-based evidence (they <em>really</em> do not like to engage the public directly for various reasons not worth going in to here).
Moreover, the security is not staffed up for lengthy queues. So they
use a VFS to ring-fence the consulate from engaging directly with the
public (yes, there are exceptions where they need to see someone but
these are not the normal case).</p></li>
<li><p>In keeping with the above, most of the world is set up to use the
<a href=""https://www.vfsglobal.co.uk/global/index.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Visa Facilitation Service (VFS)</a> as a intermediary, the applicant
drops off their stuff and then returns to collect it when they get a
notification email.  The VFS has no decision-making role and largely
acts as a secured courier, so it really makes no sense to have a
queue of people hanging around the VFS waiting for a visa to be
affixed.</p></li>
<li><p>In places like Nigeria, the passport and evidence may be sent to
their special assessment unit that performs 'deep analysis'. This can
take several weeks and it would not make sense to separate the
passport from the other evidence during this phase.</p></li>
<li><p>In the Schengen cases where the applicant must report to the
consulate for an interview, it would mean making two trips to the
consulate: one for the interview and one to collect their stuff, this
is thought to be an unreasonable burden on the applicant.</p></li>
<li><p>Especially in the British case, there is an overarching cultural influence best called: <code>'this is the way things work'</code> (TITWTW, 'titwah'). This usually operates as a
stand-alone rationale for a lot of things in the UK and visas are no
exception. If you encounter TITWTW, the discussion has reached its conclusion.</p></li>
<li><p>Other answers in the archives here have pointed out that the
application location is not necessarily the decision location.
Applications submitted in Morocco for example are decided in Croydon
(London suburbs).  Applications submitted in Kabul are decided in New
Delhi (graphic from UKVI presentation). So where would the applicant queue? </p></li>
</ul>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FItrm.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FItrm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>And as a final note, yes, it's possible for an applicant to have an ECO come around to their house or office, or for an applicant to show up at the consulate on a while-you-wait basis.  They are very flexible and will accommodate almost anything you want (I attended the <a href=""https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2014-02-03/debates/14020322000012/VisaRegulations"" rel=""noreferrer"">Parliamentary debates</a> on this topic and can attest to the flexibility). I haven't checked recently but the last time I looked, those services started at about GBP 15k and upwards from there.  A person can also arrange for a private landing interview at Heathrow (etc) and they will even send someone to small airports like Robin Hood.</p>

<hr>

<p>Note: most of the above are stated as UK specific, Schengen members have comparable or similar conditions.</p>

<p>Note: dual nationals (or holders of duplicate passports) always come up with the corner case: <em>can I apply for entry clearance with one passport and simultaneously enter the UK on my other passport?</em>  This is theoretically possible because the IO may not always know that the person has applied for entry clearance using a second passport.  But returning to Paragraph 28, if they ever find out that the person was in the UK during a pending application for entry clearance, the person becomes an illegal entrant for that period of time. That will have grave impact if the person ever tries to get another entry clearance or apply for British nationality, etc. So the bottom line is yes, but you are implicitly accepting the consequences.</p>

"How to go from Madrid Airport to Gran Via?","15107","","<p>I've seen several options using bus and subway in Google Maps, but I am looking for both the fastest and the cheapest way. I am also looking for a way to do that with the least number of line or interface changes.</p>
","<p>The fastest way to get into town quickly (barring a taxi, which is expensive and whose speed depends on traffic conditions) is the commuter trains, <a href=""http://www.renfe.com/EN/viajeros/cercanias/madrid/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cercanías</a> (<a href=""http://www.renfe.com/EN/viajeros/cercanias/madrid/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">journey planner</a>, <a href=""http://www.renfe.com/EN/viajeros/cercanias/planos/madrid.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">network map</a>). These trains are also cheaper than the Metro when you're going from or to the airport (€1,75 for a 3-zone Cercanías ticket, vs €5 for a Metro ticket from the airport to the city).</p>

<p>The downside of Cercanías is that they stop at fewer places. Line C-1, which starts at the airport, stops at Recoletos, which is about 700m from the eastern end of Gran Via. You can change at Nuevos Ministerios for line 3 or 4 and get off at Sol, the next stop: that's about 300 to 500m from anywhere on Gran Via. You can go from the ticket machines at the airport to street level on Puerta del Sol in 30min, not counting the time to wait for the train at the airport; the train only runs every 30min.</p>

<p>If you want to go to a precise Metro station, change for the Metro in the city. You'll need a separate Metro ticket: €2, or possibly down to €1.50 if your Metro trip is no more than 9 stations long. If you're going to take the Metro a lot, get a 10-trip ticket for €12. You can change at Chamartín and take line 1 to Gran Via, or change at Nuevos Ministerios and either take line 6 and change at Cuatro Caminos for line 1 to Gran Via, or take line 10 then change again at Tribunal for line 1, or simply get off at Tribunal and walk a bit.</p>

<p>You can also take the <a href=""http://www.metromadrid.es/en/viaja_en_metro/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Metro</a> (<a href=""http://www.metromadrid.es/en/viaja_en_metro/trayecto_recomendado/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">journey planner</a>, <a href=""http://www.metromadrid.es/en/viaja_en_metro/red_de_metro/planos/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">network map</a>) all the way from the airport: take line 8, change at Nuevos Ministerios for line 10 (see above) or change at Colombia for line 9 then at Núñez de Balboa for line 5 to Gran Via. The trip takes a little over an hour, so although the metros are more frequent, this doesn't compensate for their being slower than Cercanías.</p>

<p>I don't know the station maps, but generally changing between Cercanías and the Metro is no more inconvenient than changing between two Metro lines. Avoid changing to Cercanías at Chamartín as finding the right platform can be a bit annoying.</p>

</ol>
","<p>Lingering in the passageways (or disappearing into the toilets) at Gatwick for 1.5 hours is a naive idea, it's called ""suspicious behaviour"" in the contexts of both security and attempting to evade immigration control. For them, it means someone deplaned but did not reach one of the other control points and they will check where the leakage occurred with their cameras.</p>

<p>Since it's a  suspicious event, they will dispatch a unit to make eyes on contact. The unit may or may not include one of the medical cyclists on call around the clock, but for sure would include at least one security staff. They will make a welfare check and wait outside the toilet for you. Unless you are seriously ill they will conduct an id check and escort you to the primary control point for a more intensive line of enquiry.</p>

<p>When it all becomes clear that this was a simple matter of passenger convenience and not a seriously ill passenger, the IO can decide what to do. </p>

<hr>

<p>Note: the controlling technical reference for this question is <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-part-1-leave-to-enter-or-stay-in-the-uk"" rel=""noreferrer"">Paragraph 31A of the rules</a>, which says...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Where a person has arrived in the United Kingdom with leave to enter
  or remain in the United Kingdom which is in force but was given to him
  before his arrival, he may apply, on arrival at the port of entry in
  the United Kingdom, for variation of that leave. An Immigration
  Officer acting on behalf of the Secretary of State may vary the leave
  at the port of entry but is not obliged to consider an application for
  variation made at the port of entry. If an Immigration Officer acting
  on behalf of the Secretary of State has declined to consider an
  application for variation of leave at a port of entry but the leave
  has not been cancelled under paragraph 2A(8) of Schedule 2 to the
  Immigration Act 1971, the person seeking variation should apply to the
  Home Office under paragraph 32.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(And note that paragraph 32 is no longer viable)</p>

<hr>

<p>For your more specific questions...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Will the EasyJet airlines going to allow me on board? I will be coming
  from Venice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is dependent on nationality and staff diligence and intangeable factors at (I assume) Marco Polo. The answer is indeterminate.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How long does it take from landing to Immigration in London Gatwick?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At 22:30 it should take about 10 minutes max; the queue at the control point may be lengthy but no longer than about 20 minutes for a non-EU arrival.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can I stay longer in the airport before I pass through Immigration?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See above</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can I still see my luggage in the conveyor belt after 1.5 hours? How
  much time before they take away my luggage from the belt?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once the counts at each point have matched they will pull it and store it, but this will take a much longer time for them to get around to it.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>

<p>There is no such thing as hiding in Gatwick for any noticeable length of time. One way or another you will need to explain yourself and your options are (1) under suspicious behaviour or (2) passenger convenience. </p>

<p>I expect most airlines will show some discretion especially if you're obviously incapable of hurrying to your connecting flight and it is at the other end of the terminal, but this discretion doesn't seem to be backed up in the CoC.

<p>Will cab drivers or guides accept <code>USD</code> or <code>CAD</code> as tips if no Indian Rupee is available on hand?</p>
","<p>There is no preferred currency per se for exchanging into <code>INR</code> in India, although US dollar, British pound, and the Euro are the most common exchange currencies. These are the three main currencies that most foreign exchange agencies support: for buying <code>INR</code>, it is usually not a problem as among these three currencies they will be happy to accept them. However, since US dollar is the most commonly exchanged currency, you will be able to shop around at more places for a better rate than if you are trying to exchange Canadian dollars.</p>

<p>For selling <code>INR</code> and converting back to your local currency, you may find trouble finding agents that can carry out the transaction if you want to convert to high numeric amount of a foreign currency other than <code>USD</code>. Also note that most forex shops do not accept coins. There is no concept of 'commission-free' foreign exchange as it is mandatory to charge a service fee by law.</p>

<p>Converting Indian rupees to other currencies abroad is often not supported and you get bad rates; <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/q/2720/108"">the reason why there aren't many foreign exchange agencies supporting Indian rupees abroad is because the currency import/export is very tightly controlled.</a></p>

"Why does Ryanair check non-EU passengers' visas on intra-Schengen and domestic flights?","14955","","<p>Ryanair <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/53994/flying-with-ryanair-as-a-non-eu-citizen/53996"">requires</a> that all non-EU citizens report to the check-in counter to verify their immigration status, even on intra-Schengen and domestic flights. According to <a href=""http://www.ryanair.com/en/questions/non-eu-eea-passengers-document-check-requirements-for-online-check-in/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ryanair's official website</a> the rationale is that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Non EU/EEA passengers must do this in order to ensure compliance with immigration authorities.  We reserve the right to refuse travel, if there is a failure to comply with this requirement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However most other airlines don't care about visas or residency permits on intra-Schengen flights and <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/35015/does-any-airline-in-the-world-allow-air-travel-without-government-identification/35016#35016"">sometimes even let you fly without showing ID</a>.</p>

<p>So the question is: <strong>why does Ryanair conduct those checks?</strong></p>

<p>Note that the linked question is about <em>how</em> to fly as a non-EU passenger, not <em>why</em> Ryanair conducts the visa checks.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT FROM 2017</strong>: Apparently Ryanair realized how dumb their policies were and they no longer require you to go through visa checks on intra-Schengen flights</p>
","<p>You have answered your own question by providing the <em>official</em> reason Ryan Air do this: <strong>to ensure compliance with immigration authorities</strong></p>

<p>When Ryan Air first introduced this policy in 2009, <a href=""http://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/travel/ryanair-defends-visa-check-for-non-eu-citizens-1.711768"" rel=""noreferrer"">they claimed</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A Ryanair spokesman said it had introduced the rule early this summer
  to allow non-EU and -EEA passengers to use web check-in. Previously,
  the airline did not allow non-EU and -EEA passengers to check in
  online; instead, it offered a refund of the extra cost of checking in
  at the airport. </p>
  
  <p>Aer Lingus says it does not have such a requirement.
  “For those passengers who check in online, passports are checked
  either at the bag-tag desk or bag-drop machine or at the boarding
  gate,” a spokeswoman said. </p>
  
  <p>The Ryanair spokesman said: “Other airlines
  don’t offer passengers the convenience of 100 per cent web check-in,
  so they don’t need to do this yet. They check visas at their
  long-queue check-in desks, which Ryanair passengers now avoid.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of the time <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/23622/who-pays-for-the-return-ticket-when-a-country-refuses-entry"">an airline is responsible for the return flight when you are refused entry at the destination port</a>.  All other airlines do some form of basic visa checks in the background. Ryan Air either have not updated to procedures, or are choosing to do it this way.</p>

<p>Another thing to note is that Ryan Air only checks that your Passport is OK to travel, or that you have a valid visa.  They don't check for example whether you are overstaying your visa (e.g. <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/13183/about-schengen-90-180-rule"">the 90/180 rule</a>).</p>

<p><strong>But what about <del>Domestic flights or</del> flights between Schengen countries?</strong></p>

<p>This is where their official reasoning breaks down.  They have a blanket policy for all Non-EU Nationals regardless of the flight they are taking. Obviously there is no immigration requirements for domestic flight, nor is there one between two schengen countries.  They might say it is easier to have one policy for all their flights, but its hard to believe this when they are the only ones to do this in the first place.</p>

<p>Why don't they just perform the check at the boarding gate? Actually I have witnessed some positive experiences with other passengers forgetting their visa check, and the staff being nice enough to check it and stamp it at the boarding gate.  However this has been far less than the experiences of seeing people rejected.</p>

<p><strong><em>inserted:</em></strong></p>

<p>From Easy Jet (another budget airline)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Will my travel documents be checked at the airport?</strong></p>
  
  <p>You need to provide photographic ID at check-in on all flights, including domestic services. </p>
  
  <p>On domestic flights (excluding Italy) an ID check at the boarding gate
  is NOT required for passengers travelling with cabin baggage only. It
  is only mandatory that ID checks are conducted for passengers
  travelling with hold luggage. If you check-in online you will still
  need to provide your photographic ID when you go through security and
  again when you board the plane.</p>
  
  <p><strong>What are the travel documents that I need?</strong></p>
  
  <p>You need to provide photographic ID at check-in on all flights, including domestic services but the types required vary.</p>

  <ul>
  <li>not every country issues a national identity card. Please note: a driving licence does not represent a valid photographic ID, with the
  exception of UK domestic flights.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Money Making Scheme?</strong></p>

<p>Many people actually (as @Andrew Lazarus has already mentioned) believe this is another one of their money making schemes.  Many passengers are denied boarding due to this clause and by that time they do not have enough time to go back to the check-in counter and come back through security to board the flight.  Thus requiring them to purchase another ticket.</p>

<p>I would tend to agree with this idea, they also are very strict with the check-in bag sizes and their <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2370183/Ryanair-plans-sell-advertising-space-fleet-planes-boost-profits.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">idea to charge for using restrooms</a></p>

<li><p>Glaringly different from other reviews. Unless there's been a renovation or change of management, generally speaking reviews are relatively consistent.</p></li>
<li><p>Truthful reviewers tend to ""focus on spatial details (e.g., bathroom, floor, small, location) of their experience, while deceptive reviewers have difficulties in filling in spatial information.

<p>Are there ID checks in the duty free area?</p>
","<p>In general the laws pertaining to age for consuming alcohol and purchasing alcohol apply to people within the international departure area of an airport.  You are within the territory of the country the airport is in, so you are subject to that country's laws.</p>

<p>Some countries do waive specific rules within an international airport, such as allowing consumption of alcohol within a country that otherwise prohibits that.  But rules regarding being of adult age to purchase or consume alcohol still apply.</p>

<p>Do IDs get checked?  Yes I have seen it done, but I have also seen lots of places that didn't check as well.  I think this is something that depends on the clerk you deal with, and their desire to make a sale vs make sure you are legal.</p>

<p>Expanding on the logic that likely generated the question ... when you are traveling between countries, all of the laws of those countries still apply to your acts.  You are not in an empty legal zone.  When passing through an airport your acts are governed by the laws of the country the airport is located in for everything from drinking to theft to assault, etc.  While you are flying on a commercial plane, your acts are governed by both the laws of the country the airplane is registered in, as well as international agreements.

"What's the actual speed limit on highways in California?","14889","","<p>I am travelling in California this month with my car. I noticed that while the speed limit on highways is 65 MPH in most sections, people typically drive at 75-80 MPH. What's the actual speed limit on highways in California above which we get <strike>taxed</strike> speeding tickets?</p>
","<h2>What the law says</h2>

<p>In California, as in most jurisdictions, exceeding any posted speed limit is considered speeding.  You can be ticketed for going 1 MPH above, <a href=""/a/40146/1219"">and I've seen it happen</a>.  You can also be cited for speeding if you are driving faster than a <a href=""https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/pubs/vctop/vc/d11/c7/a1/22350"" rel=""nofollow"">reasonable speed for the conditions</a>, even if it's slower than the posted speed limit.</p>

<h2>In practice</h2>

<p>It's all about staying ""street smart"".</p>

<p>Exceeding the posted speed limit is extremely common on California freeways, even in the right lane.  In fact, driving at the posted limit slower than the flow of traffic is likely to be unsafe.  If you drive no faster than the surrounding traffic, and you stay alert and slow down for the Highway Patrol, you are unlikely to get ticketed.  Everyone follows the same reasoning, counting on ""safety in numbers"".</p>

<p>If you are the first car in a pack or the fastest car on a wide-open road, you are definitely at risk for a speeding citation.</p>

<p>That said, if you do get cited for speeding, ""going with the flow of traffic"" is a defense that is not likely to work in court.</p>

<p>None of what I said above constitutes legal advice.</p>

"Can I get a cheaper one-way flight by booking and cancelling a flexible return leg for a refund?","14885","","<p>I’m looking to book a one-way flight from the UK to a European city. The airline [I don’t think it matters which one specifically; this question is really about the principle] wants to charge around £400 for a one-way ticket, but only around £100 each way if I book a return. I can select different tariffs for the two legs, so it looks like it would be possible to book the (low-cost) “advance/saver” tariff for the outbound leg and a (refundable) “flexible” tariff for the return leg.</p>

<p>So can I book a return like this, fly the outbound leg, then cancel the return leg for a refund? Or am I likely to hit some restriction in the small print that will prevent me?</p>

<p>(I don’t know whether this kind of thing is frowned upon as “gaming the system”, or if it’s simply “using the system to my own best advantage”…)</p>
","<p>No, this will not work.</p>

<p>Buying a return ticket and only using the first leg of it will certainly work - just make sure that you don't skip any of the legs before the one(s) you intend to use to avoid the ticket being canceled.</p>

<p>However what will not work is trying to book a refundable fare class for the return, and then obtaining a refund for that leg.  The reason is, as you've guessed it may be, in the ""fine print"" - or specifically in the fare rules.</p>

<p>All airlines will have something like this in their fare rules and/or Contract or Carriage (CoC) :</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>OPEN JAWS/ROUND TRIPS/CIRCLE TRIPS NOTE -
  WHEN COMBINED WITH HALF ROUND TRIP FARES TO FORM
  ROUND/CIRCLE/OPEN JAW TRIPS **THE MOST RESTRICTIVE
  CONDITIONS APPLY.**  THESE INCLUDE MINIMUM/MAXIMUM
  STAY /RESERVATION/TICKETING REQUIREMENTS/STOPOVER/
  COMBINATION PROVISIONS AND **CANCELLATION CHARGES.**
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Specifically that example is from American Airlines, but the others will be similar.</p>

<p>This means that if only one of the flights on a ticket isn't refundable, then neither are any of the other flights booked on the same ticket - even if they are different fare codes that would normally allow for refunds.</p>

<p>If you were to ask the airline to cancel the return leg then they will normally ""reprice"" the entire ticket, which basically means that they will calculate the price again for the whole ticket - including legs you've already flow!  This will put you back into the original situation of being after a one-way, and as the price of that will be higher than you've already paid, there won't be a refund due.</p>

<p>It's worth keeping in mind that whilst one-way flights will sometimes be more expensive, they often come with better conditions (eg, allowing changes and/or refunds) that the cheaper return flights do not.  Booking a return and simply not using the return portion may make sense if you saves you money - but make sure that you're not taking a higher risk to save a small amount of money. In this case it looks like you're saving around £200 so it probably is worth doing, but if you were only saving £20 then you'd almost certainly be better off paying a little more for the one-way and the additional flexibility it probably gives you.</p>

","<p>Before boarding, actually before entering the duty-free zone, you will go through standard security screening checks. <strong>Your jacket will have to go through an X-ray machine</strong>, and you (and your trousers) will have to go through the metal detector.

","<p>Well there is definitely free Wi-Fi at Guangzhou International Airport, including in locations that transit passengers can use.</p>

<li>how long would it take by ferry?</li>

  <p>A: BC Ferries does not provide service between Seattle and Vancouver, and we are unaware of any companies that do at this time. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think the issue is that it wouldn't be popular enough for a direct service. Most people wanting to travel that route direct will do one of drive, take the bus, or take the <a href=""http://www.amtrakcascades.com/"">Amtrak Cascades Train</a> (which is supposed to have great views).</p>

<p>What there are is quite a lot of people in either Seattle or Vancouver who want to visit Victoria and the rest of Vancouver Island. I think your only option is to change ferries there. It's supposed to be a very nice spot to visit, so you could maybe even stop off for a day on your way. You've even got the option to take the ferry to one part of the island, make your way along, then continue from a different port. There seems to be a good map of the ferries on the <a href=""http://www.vancouverisland.com/Maps/?id=48"">Vancouver Island website</a>. If you're feeling really keen, you could even stop off on both Vancouver Island, and one of the San Juan Islands. (I've visited the latter, which was nice AND we can got to see whales on the trip! I've not yet been to Vancouver Island, so I can't comment on that yet, will hopefully update this bit in late June when I have!)</p>

<p>Oh, and just so you don't get false hope, <a href=""http://www.clippervacations.com/"">Clipper Vacations</a> (who run ferries between Seattle, the San Juan Islands and Victoria) will sell you tickets between Seattle and Vancouver, but these are actually for the train or the bus, not a boat</p>

"How to prevent the passenger in front of you from reclining without notice?","14686","","<p>I can totally understand <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/11234/can-you-expect-the-flight-attendants-to-tell-the-passenger-in-front-of-you-to-pu"">someone reclining his seat on a long-distance flight</a>. On a short hop, I don’t have any sympathy for anyone using his “right” to recline his seat. The seat pitch on short flights these days make you an anti-social person by default if you choose to recline. I had my share of not being able to even drink a cup of coffee because somebody just wanted to “rest”.</p>

<p>I usually try to reposition my legs as much as possible, not only because I have to, but also to try to make the journey as unpleasant for the rester as it is for me. I’m aware that is just childish behaviour, so I am wondering whether there are more effective and more civilized countermeasures to make the flight pleasant for both of us.</p>
","<p>So, there are two mechanical solutions to, what is, fundamentally social problem, but before I provide them, <strong>I want to make clear that employing these is an easy way to be regarded as a <em>jerk</em> by your fellow passengers, and not without merit; the seat is designed to recline, and while putting it back can be inconsiderate, restricting the use of the feature by others can be <em>just as</em> inconsiderate on a long flight.</strong> Think long and hard about just how much of an asshole you are willing to be before attempting to block the passenger in front of you from taking what small comfort they can in the horrid conditions found in coach class on a commercial airliner.</p>

<p>First, the commercial solution: <a href=""http://www.kneedefender.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Knee Defender</a>. A small device that clips onto the arms supporting the tray table, when the clip is in place, the seat in front of you is unable to recline. It can be adjusted to allow for limited recline, if you're feeling considerate, but the 'courtesy card' provided by the manufacturer should be pretty clear evidence that this is inherently a pretty inconsiderate product.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PxLdf.gif"" alt=""Knee Defender Courtesy Card""></p>

<p>If, in addition to being a jerk, you're also a cheapskate, you might want to look into using a <a href=""http://lifehacker.com/5147317/reclaim-your-airline-seat-space-with-a-water-bottle"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">water bottle or other, similarly sized rigid object</a> as a shim to prevent the seat in front of you from reclining. Like the Knee Defender, this has the downside of requiring that you keep your tray table down to rescue your precious legroom, and, unlike the Knee Defender, also will take up some space on the tray table, which may or may not bother you. It is similarly inconsiderate to use.</p>

<p><strong>Alternately, you could be less of a jerk, and pay the often pretty nominal premium to get a bulkhead facing/exit row seat, where nobody is in front of you to recline.</strong></p>

"Are calls to international numbers charged at international rates if the caller is in the same country?","14666","","<p>Suppose I take my phone on roaming from one country (say Australia) to another (say Belgium). 
How do these plans typically work? Will somebody else in Belgium have to pay international rates to call me, given that they would have to call me using the international prefix? Will I have to pay a roaming fee to receive the call?</p>
","<p>The person calling you will be calling your Australian number, so they will be charged whatever they normally pay for a call to Australia.  As you are roaming, you will be charged for receiving the call at whatever your roaming rate is.</p>

<p>In most cases, the call itself will actually route via Australia and back to wherever you are!  It's possible that if your phone is roaming onto the same network as the person that's calling you is on that the call will route locally, but there's no guarantee.</p>

<p>The reverse case is very different.  If you call a number in the country that you are in then you will normally pay a lower rate to make the call than it costs for you to receive a call, and the person you call will only pay their standard rate for an incoming call (which is free is many/most countries). Obviously the exact costs will depend upon your provider and what they charge for calls whilst roaming, but in most cases it'll be cheaper for you to call someone in-country than for them to call you.</p>

<p>Depending on how long you're going to be there, the best option is often to buy a pre-paid SIM in the country your visiting.  You'll get a local country number that people can call you on, and you won't pay high roaming costs for calls that you make.</p>

"Non-biological laundry detergent available in the US?","14631","","<p>I'm from the UK, visiting the US for a few months. I am allergic to biological laundry detergents. I can't seem to find any non-biological detergent available. Is it sold under a different term in the US? Is there a specific brand I should buy? Most of the ones I can find at the supermarket say somewhere on the back that they contain biodegradable surfactants and enzymes, which I assume means that they're what we would call biological in the UK, and would make me itch. Is this correct?</p>
","<p>We do not use the terms ""biological"" and ""non-biological"" detergent in the United States. Instead, we label them <a href=""http://www.scienceinthebox.com/en_UK/safety/whatareenzymes_en.html"">enzyme detergents</a>. They're mostly used in order to avoid things like having to presoak laundry (the proteins will help attack stains) or treating stains with another method.</p>

<p>If you are in a store or something, reading the labels on detergents will indicate if they contain anything like probiotic/enzyme/protein ingredients.</p>

<p>There are some brands that claim their products contain no enzymes or similar additives, including:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""http://www.planetinc.com/ull.htm"">Planet Ultra Liquid Detergent</a> - claims to have no dyes, fragrances, perfumes, or enzymes/proteins</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://eco-max.ca/consumer/"">Eco-Max</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://www.sundetergent.com/laundry_freeandclear.aspx0"">Sun Free and Clear</a></p></li>

<li><p>All Free and Clear (should be very easy to find anywhere)</p></li>
<li><p>Purex Ultra Hypoallergenic (though most Purex doesn't contain enzymes)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Typically, ""Free and Clear"" detergents probably won't contain enzymes, as they're meant to be hypoallergenic, but I would read the labeling to make sure.</p>

<hr>

<p>So yes, seeing ""enzyme"" on the label means it's like 'biological detergent' in the UK. </p>

<p>Biodegradable is a different idea. Basically, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodegradable"">biodegradable detergents</a> do not contain ingredients that can not be destroyed if it were just poured out into the ocean or nature or something. Some detergents (mostly the mainstream major brands) contain stuff like dyes or fragrances which can't be broken down by natural means.</p>

"Cheapest season to go to South Africa from North America","14603","","<p>What is the cheapest season/months to visit South Africa from North America?<br>
How can one best take advantage of ""low"" season offers?</p>

<p>Looking at South African Airlines, summer flight fares (June - August) seem to be highest 
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CrPPl.jpg"" alt=""SAA flight &quot;specials&quot;""></p>

<p><strong>BUT</strong> the hotel and lodge fares in South Africa seem to be lowest during the same time period as it's ""winter"" in South Africa.  </p>

<p>Going at other times of the year when the flight costs are cheaper means that accommodation prices are higher.</p>
","<p>While it may not be exactly what you're asking, I feel it's the correct answer, and that's NOT to go in winter. There's a reason it's priced like that.</p>

<p>I'm assuming you're off to South Africa for one or more of a few reasons: big game, scenery, culture.  As someone born there, I can highly recommend it for tourists.</p>

<p>Now, I have returned as a tourist as well, so can give both sides of the story.  You don't need to be super-confident about your travelling ability - I wasn't the first time I took four friends back, and we found ways to be resourceful and keep the costs down.</p>

<p>As you mention you're trying to best take advantage of prices, consider that in low season, prices are lower, yes, but there's a reason - it's colder, fewer animals, etc.  However, in the heat of summer, you'll struggle to see animals as well - they shelter under trees and the like.  In winter, you also get fewer daylight hours.</p>

<p>My suggestion, and I did this myself, is to bridge and get the best of both worlds - go in autumn or spring.  We went for a month in March/April, and I went back with a family member another time in September - so in Autumn and then Spring, and it was an excellent time to go.  Hotels weren't full, so there were still specials to be had and deals to be negotiated. They'll often bend over backwards if you say where you're from.  One hotel in Durban was ""you're the guys from New Zealand!"" on arrival, as we'd emailed to book.  It was a pleasure being so welcomed.  You won't get that (well you might, but it's less likely) in high season.</p>

<p>As I'm sure you're aware, making the most of cost isn't about getting the lowest dollar, it's getting the best value.  It also meant that there were a few less tourists in the game parks. In the mountains. On the beaches.  And yet it was still plenty warm enough to enjoy the sun, it wasn't the wet season either (we had precisely 2.5 days of rain - 2 of which were unfortunately in Durban).</p>

<p>Now fortunately we also have others ask questions on here about South Africa :)  You're obviously already looking at flights. It's the biggest expense, and once you know when you're going, ask here again (especially in the chat room) as some of us pride ourselves on beating prices people find. (we're weird like that).</p>

<p>Next you may be looking at car rental.  Should you book from outside or wait till you get there? <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/4939/is-it-better-to-book-a-car-rental-in-advance-or-once-im-in-south-africa"">We have an answer for that</a>.  These days, sites like kayak or other multiple-search sites will get you such good deals, that you can safely book ahead, but there's no harm in emailing a couple of the local rental agencies and seeing if they'll give you a discount, or a bigger car, especially if it's not peak season.</p>

<p>Itinerary.  I'm not sure what you're after, but we had a question asking about a <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/q/2865/101"">possible two week itinerary</a> a while back.  I was between jobs at the time, so wrote a full response, with links - hopefully some of that might be useful.</p>

<p>Wine tours? We've done research on that too and found some of the best contacts.  Some of the users on here have <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/q/5871/101"">actually been to the wineries and written about them</a>.</p>

<p>Another person asked about going in <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/a/2866/101"">January and booking ahead</a>.  It's like any other place - book ahead if you know where you're going to be.  Saying that, we were booking guest houses when we went, and these days I travel hostel, which would be a lot simpler, I'd assume.  But back then I was booking for five people so wanted to make sure I got it right.</p>

<p>Another thing to note is the school holidays.  The Gauteng (provice) holidays tend to cause massive amounts of traffic in Natal - especially on the N3.  Durban is overrun with holiday-makers from Gauteng.  Best to keep an eye on that if you're wanting a relaxing time on the beach.  It also tends to be when prices go up as well.  So really to maximise your benefit, try for a time that is not peak season, not totally off season, and not during Gauteng holidays ;)</p>

<p>While most multiple-airline search engines will find South African Airways, they won't necessarily find ComAir or the other smaller ones.  Have a look at <a href=""http://wikitravel.org/en/Air_travel_in_South_Africa"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this wikitravel page</a> on air travel within South Africa.  Not only will it give you some of the smaller airlines to fly with (ComAir is fine, can't vouch for the others, but it's only a couple of hours flying anywhere anyway), but it also lists car rental companies to compare prices with.</p>

<p>If you do drive, be aware it's on the left side of the road, and while the speed limit is 120km/hr, if you do that you'll be tooted at and passed - most travel around 140km/hr.  There's a reason the road toll is very high.  Don't worry about driving on the left - if you currently drive in North America, it's not too hard to learn to use it the other way - I've had to do that coming here to Canada :)</p>

<p>Right, I hope that helps.  Feel free to add any questions to your question (edit them in) and I can always edit my answer to help.</p>

"Do airport metal scanners occasionally flash a false alarm on purpose?","14575","","<p>I've noticed that occasionally when passing through the metal scanners I am getting flagged despite not having a single metal thing on me.

<p>Is this being done on purpose to give an excuse for extra checks? 
Or perhaps the button on my jeans or some other tiny piece of metal is triggering the alarm?</p>
","<p>Sometimes. </p>

<p>At least in the TSA Precheck lanes in the United States, the metal detectors (Precheck lanes use metal detectors, not body scanners) can alarm randomly to alert the screeners to perform a random check (you can read <a href=""https://www.flyertalk.com/forum/trusted-travelers/1619472-tsa-precheck-random-extra-screening-5.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">various anecdotal experiences in this forum thread</a>). Some people report it happening frequently enough to them that they suspect it's less than random, though I know of no definitive proof of this, and the nature of random events is such that some people will feel singled out regardless.</p>

<p>In my experience, the TSA screener at the lane can tell the difference between an alarm caused by the presence of metal (they'll tell you to check your pockets or take off your watch or belt or whatever) and one caused by the randomizer. In some cases, they'll stop you and tell you that it's random as you start to check your pockets. If the random alarm goes off, they usually do a hand swab or a brief pat-down or some other additional check; I've heard of people getting sent to the body scanner as well.</p>

<hr>

<p>While the exact configuration of airport security equipment is typically confidential information, it's not uncommon for the manufactures of walk-through metal detectors to offer an optional ""programmable Random Alarm capability.""

<p>Can I use it for identification purposes, i.e. boarding a plane, when in Europe?</p>

<p>I understand from Wikipedia that there are exceptions, but what is the general rule? Am I safe if I carry it instead of my ID card?</p>
","<p>It entirely depends on the purpose and the country. For example, in the Netherlands, a European driver's license is a completely valid ID and can be used, e.g., to vote. In France, there is no exhaustive list of what counts as ID so there is no reason a driver's license shouldn't be accepted by the police (see <a href=""https://expatriates.stackexchange.com/questions/994/if-asked-for-id-in-france-by-the-police-as-an-eu-national-what-is-considered-va"">this question on expatriates.SE</a> for a long-winded discussion of this specific case). Elsewhere, it might not be considered a valid ID and private organizations everywhere (e.g. banks) might also have other requirements.</p>

<p>The problem is that to travel internationally, you need more than ID, you need something to establish your citizenship and prove your right to enter the destination country. A driver's license is not enough for that. Similarly, if you want to make use of your right to free movement as an EU citizen, you need something that establishes that you are indeed an EU citizen and that something is typically a passport or national ID card. If you travel by land, you might get away with not having one on you but boarding a plane is often more difficult.</p>

<p>I was once allowed to take an internal Schengen flight with only a driver's license and a few other documents like a health insurance card from my country of destination (after losing my ID) but I think it was just the person at the desk bending the rules and counting on the fact that there would be no check at the other end (we went to the desk as soon as we noticed the ID was missing, we did not intend to just show a driver's license when boarding).</p>

<p>Finally, EU countries recognize each other's national ID cards so unless you are a citizen from one of the countries that do not issue those at all (Denmark, the UK), you don't need anything else and that's true EU-wide (not only in the Schengen area, also in the UK, Ireland, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia, Cyprus, the EEA or Switzerland but not necessarily elsewhere in Europe).</p>

<p>Otherwise, simply call it ""San Francisco"".  There isn't a shorter nickname in common use.  It is a lot of syllables; locals tend to say it fast and slur a bit, something like ""Sanfruh sisko"".</p>

<p>Spanish speakers should note that, as with most Spanish place-names in California, most English-speaking locals use a semi-anglicized pronunciation.  ""San"" is rhymed with ""ban"", ""man"", ""tan"".  ""Francisco"" sounds like the English name ""Francis"" plus ""ko"", but the accent is still on ""cis"".  The vowel in ""Fran"" is either the same vowel as ""San"", or else an unstressed ""schwa"" vowel.</p>

<p>""SF"" is acceptable in writing (especially headlines, text messages, etc), but not so common in conversation.  ""SFO"" refers to the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_International_Airport"">airport</a> but not the city.  I personally have never heard or seen ""SFX"".</p>

<p>""San Fran"" and ""Frisco"" are deprecated and will tend to mark you as an outsider.  Locals tend to find ""Frisco"" particularly annoying.  This goes back <a href=""http://www.notfrisco.com/colmatales/norton/proclaim.html#frisco"">at least 140 years</a>.</p>

<p>(I think there's a convention that people who work in the airline industry are ""allowed"" to say ""SanFran"".  So the agent at the airport ticket counter might tell you ""Your bags are checked through to SanFran"", but don't take that as an indication of general practice.)</p>

<hr>

<p>If you want to refer to the greater metropolitan area (including Oakland, San Jose, etc), and not just the city proper, it's ""the Bay Area"".  </p>

<p>This is further subdivided into ""North Bay"" (north of the Bay itself, e.g. Marin, Sonoma, Napa and Solano Counties), ""East Bay"" (Oakland, Berkeley, and the rest of Alameda and Contra Costa Counties), and ""South Bay"" (San Jose and its immediate suburbs).  There is no ""West Bay"". The ill-defined region between San Francisco and the South Bay (including South San Francisco, San Bruno, etc) is ""the Peninsula"".</p>

<p>As a side note, I don't think locals use the term ""Silicon Valley"" much; they're more likely to refer to specific cities like Palo Alto, Santa Clara, etc.</p>

"Is there travel insurance for missed flights?","14430","","<p>Our family will be going to Rome this November.  As in <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/6187/paranoid-about-missing-my-return-flight-home-from-rome-what-to-do%29"">a previous question</a>, I am worried about missing my return flight home.</p>

<p>Is there travel insurance that will help us find a return ticket home if that happens?  I'm talking about us missing a flight with no fault of the airline.  Like if the train breaks down or we get stuck in traffic.</p>

<p>This policy would need to buy us return tickets home and since there might not be a ticket available, I imagine it would have to be able to do some clever negotiating with the airline and hotels.</p>

<p>Does that exist?</p>
","<p>Most travel insurance policies will cover delayed or missed flights, but you need to read the fine print very carefully to find out exactly what they will cover and in what situations, as it varies dramatically between policies.</p>

<p>Most policies will only cover instances where the missed flight was beyond your control.  eg, they may cover your train breaking down and you being stuck on it for several hours, but not you simply sleeping in.  In most cases the burden of proof is going to be on you to prove that missing the flight wasn't your fault, so even if being stuck in the worst traffic jam for 10 years is a valid reason - how do you prove it?</p>

<p>The payout/assistance offered in such situations also varies. Some policies will only cover the price you originally paid for the ticket, which will probably be far less than it will cost for a last-minute replacement.  Other policies will cover the cost of the new ticket, as well as hotels for the delay, etc.</p>

"Why are there holes in ice cubes in airplanes?","14426","","<p>It could be due to boredom that I notice this, but it seems that only on airplanes ice cube have holes. Why is that? </p>
","<p>They have the holes because of the machines that made them (check DavidG's answer), anyway this ice cubes with holes are better for planes for a few reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Because they are lighter (believe it or not, every gram in the aviation business counts, plus the ice is not made onboard, it is loaded prior to departure just like the food)</li>
<li>They cool things faster due to larger area of contact with the liquid</li>
<li>They also will allow more liquid to be filled in the already small airplane cups.</li>
<li>Last thing, they do not tend to stick together in the ice bucket, so cabin crew won't need to smash it to break it down.</li>

"Never got toll in the mail (NY)","14402","","<p>Driving home from Maine on June 27th (about one and a half months ago), I passed (briefly) through New York City, and entered Manhattan by the Henry Hudson Bridge. Signs indicated that I would have my license plate photographed and receive a toll bill for $5.50 in the mail. The bill never arrived. Will there be a consequence to not paying the toll if I ever drive through New York again? Is there a way to deal with this online?</p>

<p>EDIT: My car is leased, and the bill went to the leasing company - this possibility (or that it would be relevant at all) did not occur to me because I assumed it would be sent based on the name of the registration rather than the name of the actual owner. I was able to pay the toll by calling in to the number given in the answer.</p>

<p>EDIT2: I eventually received a bill anyway, in October. I could not log in on the tolls by mail website, so I assumed it had cleared itself up. I lost track of the second bill in holiday season chaos, and eventually had to call by phone again to resolve the issue. Fortunately, I had kept the confirmation number from my original payment, but to anyone else in this situation I would recommend <em>not</em> attempting as I did to pay over the phone without having received a bill - you will be billed eventually.</p>
","<p>After crossing the Henry Hudson Bridge without an E-ZPass, you normally should receive a toll bill within 30 days.</p>

<p>However, you might not have received one if the address of your vehicle registration is not your current address, or if the equipment at the toll plaza was malfunctioning when you drove through.</p>

<p>If you didn't receive a toll bill, <a href=""http://www.lohud.com/story/news/traffic/2015/03/12/henry-hudson-bridge-unpaid-cashless-tolls-fees/70198872/"">you should call 1-800-333-8655</a>.

Of course, if they have no record of your crossing the bridge, you don't need to do anything else...</p>

<p>I have a valid Indian Passport but my currently stamped H1b visa is expired. I have a valid I-797 which I will use to get a H1b visa stamping in India. I have a confirmed round trip ticket to come back to Boston.</p>

<p>Please let me know if I need a Transit Visa in Zurich based on my situation.</p>
","<p>You do not need a visa in this case. In the Schengen area, most people can transit in international airports without a visa if they don't leave the transit area. This only works if you have only <strong>one</strong> layover in the Schengen area (so a BOS-FRA-ZRH-BOM route would <strong>not</strong> be OK because both FRA and ZRH are in the Schengen area).</p>

<p>However, even if you only have one layover, there are restrictions for the citizens of some countries (so-called annex IV countries). India is not one of them but individual Schengen member states can add other countries to that list and transit for Indian citizens is in fact <a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/e-library/documents/policies/borders-and-visas/visa-policy/docs/annex_7b_atv-national_lists.en.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">restricted in several member states</a>. Specifically, transiting in Germany, France, Spain and the Czech Republic is not possible for Indian citizens without an “airport transit visa”. You can still transit in Zurich because <a href=""https://www.bfm.admin.ch/content/dam/data/bfm/rechtsgrundlagen/weisungen/visa/bfm/bfm-anh01-liste2-e.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Switzerland does not impose the same requirement</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, a <em>valid</em> US visa would exempt you from the airport transit visa requirement where it applies but AFAIK the I-797 is not considered a valid document for visa-free transit.</p>

"How early should I arrive to Heathrow before departure?","14341","","<p><a href=""http://www.heathrow.com/departures/checking-in"" rel=""nofollow"">Heathrow website</a> says that it's enough to arrive two hours before departure (European flights), but I have heard that the lines are often long so maybe three hours would be better? How early should I arrive to the airport?</p>

<p>To be specific, I have a 10 AM flight at September from terminal 3.</p>
","<p>The answer depends on 4 things:</p>

<ul>
<li>How you are getting to the airport</li>
<li>What airline you're flying with</li>
<li>How frequent the flights on that route are</li>
<li>How good your travel insurance is</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have great travel insurance, are on a route with one flight roughly ever hour, and are just hopping on the tube for 20 minutes to get there, then arriving just before you're airline's cut-off time is probably fine.</p>

<p>If you're taking two trains a bus on a 3+ hour journey, with travel insurance that isn't very good about missed departure compensation, to take a once-a-day flight, I'd say aim to be there at least 3 hours before</p>

<p>The close of baggage check and at-desk checkin times varies between airlines. BA, for example, have a <a href=""http://www.britishairways.com/en-gb/information/checking-in?source=MNVINF3checking_in&amp;link=main_nav"" rel=""nofollow"">45 minute cut-off at T3 and T5</a>, AA <a href=""http://www.americanairlines.co.uk/pubcontent/en_US/travelInformation/checkingIn/arrivalTimes.jsp"" rel=""nofollow"">it's 60 minutes</a>, so check with your specific airline to see what they require.</p>

<p>Security queues can be bad at Heathrow, but not as bad as you find at some other airports world-wide. I often grumble about the Heathrow ones, but frankly I've had worse at JFK and Seattle recently! If you're a frequent traveller who knows how to properly unpack your bag, take out liquids properly, already has liquids in a suitable bag etc, you should be fine within the minimum checkin times. For less frequent travellers, I'd say 1 hour should be OK.</p>

<p>The question then is more about possible delays getting to the airport. You need to leave enough time so that if you get delayed, you won't miss the flight. The 2-3 hour figure tends to be more about that, at least for Heathrow. Think about what could go wrong, what's likely to go wrong, backup options, delay lengths etc. Then, check your travel insurance, and see what they require. If your travel insurance won't cover missed departures due to delays getting to the airport, go for 3 hours minimum unless really close. If your travel insurance says you must have aimed for 2.5 hours before if they'll cover it, obviously leave 2.5 hours!</p>

<p>Finally, there are shops airside in T3, and some restaurants, so it's not the end of the world if you get there with lots of time to spare. There are also some lounges you can pay to enter (the No.1 Traveller lounge in T3 is very nice, for example). If you have status or are travelling in a premium cabin, that could be a reason to get there extra early so you can enjoy the lounge more!</p>

<p>There is no universal answer</p>

"Should I tip my Airbnb host?","14338","","<p>I am about to embark on my first Airbnb experience for a little over a week.  I was wondering if it is customary or expected to tip the host upon departure or perhaps along the way, as it seems like they will be at the house while I'm staying there.</p>
","<p>In my opinion Airbnb is nothing but a short-let provider. Yes people do rent out their spare rooms, and thus welcome you in their house. But they do so in exchange for money, very much like a hotel, or a bed-and-breakfast, would do. In that sense <strong>I don't think tipping is necessary</strong>. </p>

<p>If you want to show appreciation to an excellent host, the best way to do so is to bring a gift. Once again, this is not mandatory.</p>

<p>Now, <a href=""https://www.airbnb.com/help/search?q=tipping"">Airbnb does not seem to mention tipping on their website</a> (""why would they?"", you might ask). However I did find an <a href=""http://www.atlasandboots.com/airbnb-etiquette-10-tips-for-guests/"">independent blogger</a> stating that you shouldn't tip your host:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>Bonus Tip: Should I tip my Airbnb host?</h3>
  
  <p>This question that has cropped up repeatedly since we published this
  original post. The short answer is no, you should not tip your Airbnb
  host. Tipping is a way of showing appreciation for good service, but
  Airbnb hosts don’t see what they’re doing as a service as such –
  rather, they’re sharing their home with you as an equal. You and they
  co-exist in the same space; they do not ‘serve’ you in the same way
  that hotel staff might do. As such, there is no need to tip them. If
  you want to show your appreciation, a small gift such as a box of
  chocolates or even just a note would be more appropriate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://www.inc.com/oscar-raymundo/holiday-tipping-guide-sharing-economy.html?cid=sf01001"">This other article on Inc</a> seems to share this opinion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>Accommodations</h3>
  
  <p>Leaving a tip for your Airbnb or HomeAway host is not necessary, and
  may in fact counter the communal spirit of home-sharing. Instead leave
  the hosts a gift to thank them for the stay, a nice bottle of wine or
  even fresh flowers.</p>

"From Uyuni, Bolivia to Salta, Argentina by bus","14331","","<p>Does anyone knows how can I get from Uyuni, Bolivia to Salta, Argentina by bus? And what the approximate cost/time will be to get there?</p>
","<p>So there are two options.</p>

<p>1) You're planning on doing a Salt Flats tour, if you're going to Uyuni? Most of these run from Uyuni to San Pedro de Atacama in Chile, or vice versa, and take 3ish days.  It's well worth it and you should consider that if you haven't already, as it'll make the next part really easy.  Once you're in San Pedro, there are buses over the Andes to Salta, and it takes <a href=""http://www.marksmayo.com/2010/08/27/the-best-11-hour-bus-ride/"">approximately 11 hours</a>.</p>

<p>2) If however, you're set on going direct from Uyuni to Salta (perhaps you're only doing a day tour in Uyuni, which would be a shame but understandable if time restricted), then it's important to realise there are no direct buses from Uyuni to Salta. You'll need to complete two stages - first from Uyuni to the border town of Villazon, and then down to Salta in Argentina.  Buses tend to go via Tupiz to Villazon, and are not that regular - so if you're doing a tour you'll want to check before hand what time the buses are and whether they can book you a ticket beforehand.</p>

<p>Then you cross the border into La Quiaca (it's like the same town, just other side of the border, different time zone too), and catch a new bus down to Salta, which takes about 7-8 hours.  You walk across the border, and there are several bus companies at regular intervals down to Salta - that's the easy part of the trip - Argentine buses are also much more comfortable :)</p>

<p>As for cost, it varies dramatically by bus company, level of comfort, time, day of week and with the current crazy fluctuations in the $ARS, I'd be guessing.  From talking to some Argentine folk in the hostel here the other day, it sounds like everything's varying tons at present.  But in general, coming from overseas you will find them pretty reasonable - especially the very cheap Bolivian buses.</p>

"Why do some hotels ask you to leave the key at the reception when you go out to come back later?","14302","","<p>Sometimes when I check in at a hotel I am asked to drop the key at the reception before leaving the premises, even if I will stay longer.
When this happens, I normally do like they ask me, but sometimes I forget and take the key with me the whole day.
Even then, when I come back to the hotel in the evening I find my room cleaned and nothing different happens.</p>

<p>So why do some hotels ask you to always leave the key at the reception before you go out? This seems like a waste of time for both the reception and the guest, so I imagine there must be some advantage?</p>
","<p>I have encountered this practice in the past as well.  Once I actually talked to them about the reason for it. In that particular hotel, this was encouraged, but not required. They explained that there were two reasons (for that particular hotel):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It's much easier for them to know when the guests are out, so they can go and clean the room.  They have had cases when the maid would knock on the door, receive no answer, and open the door with her own key -- just to find the guest still in the room, often in a state rather not expecting anyone to come in (this did include on a few occasions walking on people having sex)</p></li>
<li><p>Minimise the risk of the key being lost/stolen. This reduces the cost in the long run - both in term of the keys/locks needing replacing, but also the liability.  In that hotel, the keys were quite distinctive, clearly showing the hotel name and the room number on the key.  If a key is lost, whoever finds it can just come in to the hotel, go to the room and steal something - and the guests would hold the hotel liable for the stolen property.  The sign at the reception actually stated that the hotel would bear no responsibility for guests' property left in the room unless the key was handed to the reception upon leaving the hotel.</p></li>

"How long does it take to transfer from Terminal 3 to Terminal 1 at SFO?","14275","","<p>In March I will be travelling with my wife from Las Vegas McCarran Int'l Airport (LAS) to London Heathrow (LHR) via San Francisco Int'l Airport (SFO.) We have recently received a unexpected flight reservation change that means we will only have 1 hour 11 minutes to transfer from SFO Terminal 3 to SFO Terminal 1. Is this enough time?</p>

<p>Additional information:</p>

<ul>
<li>I am British, and my wife is Australian</li>
<li>We booked through ebookers.com with Lufthansa, although these flights are operated by United Airlines</li>
</ul>

<p>Related sub-questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>When will we go through security in this trip?</li>
<li>Will our luggage be transferred automatically to the new flight?</li>
<li>Who could we contact at EBookers, Lufthansa, United Airlines or SFO to get this information?</li>
</ol>
","<p>Officially the ""Minimum Connection Time"" for United Domestic -> United International at SFO is 45 minutes, and as you're above this it is still what is considered a ""legal"" connection.</p>

<p>However all this really means is that if you miss your connection the airline is responsible for finding you a seat on a later SFO-LHR flight.  It doesn't mean that you'll make your connection, nor does it mean that the airline will cover any additional expenses such as hotels during the delay, etc (They might, but it depends on the cause of the delay).</p>

<p>As both of your flights are on United you do NOT need to re-clear security at SFO, nor do you need to collect your bags as they will be checked all the way through from LAS to LHR.</p>

<p>Presuming that your LAS-SFO flight has a flight number below 2000 then you inbound flight will arrive in Terminal 3, and your outbound flight will leave from the International Terminal G.  These two terminals are connected by an air-side walkway, and depending on which gates you land at and depart from it will be in the 10-15 minute range to walk for an average person.</p>

<p>If your inbound flight is a flight number above 6000 then it will arrive in Terminal 1. There is an air-side bus from Terminal 1 to Terminal G, but depending on how busy the bus is it could take up to 20+ minutes to get between the two terminals and to your gate.</p>

<p>Your outbound flight will start boarding around around 45 minutes before departure, and technically you need to be at the gate 30 minutes before departure time, although realistically 10-15 mins is normally the minimum - any later and you risk losing your seat.</p>

<p>So basically, if everything goes right and your inbound flight is on time then you'll have no trouble making your connection.  You probably won't have enough spare time for anything other than a very quick bathroom break, but it's doable.</p>

<p>However if your inbound flight is delayed even a little - which is not uncommon on LAS-SFO flights, especially if it's a morning flight - then you will likely miss your connecting flight.  Depending on the time of year there are only 1 or 2 direct SFO-LHR flights per day on United, so the impact of missing your flight is very high - most likely an up to 24 hour delay!</p>

<p>If it were me, I would be changing to an earlier LAS-SFO flight.  United is normally very happy to do this when there has been a schedule change. In this case as the ticket was booked via an agency and as a codeshare they may not be willing to assist, but I would start with them presuming you can conveniently call them.  Otherwise talk to EBookers and ask them to arrange the change.  In cases like this it's normally best to know exactly what you want before calling (eg, you want flight UAxxx from LAS-SFO rather than your existing UAyyyy).</p>

"How do you pack your dirty clothing when moving from hotel to hotel?","14263","","<p>I'm getting much better at packing my clean clothes when I am preparing for a trip, but I still haven't figured out what to do with my dirty clothes when I need to pack them to move hotels.  My goals are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Avoid using ""clean areas"" of luggage.</li>
<li>Make them easy to identify as dirty and find all at once, so that I don't forget to wash them when I do laundry on the road</li>
<li>Not make the suitcase more bulky than when clothes were clean</li>
</ul>

<p>I've tried the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ball them up in a plastic bag</li>
<li>Put them in my shoe bags</li>
<li>Put them in the outside pockets of a suitcase</li>
</ul>
","<p>The problem with dirty clothes is they will take huge space when packing them again (if not done correctly), logically the clothes are the same but after packing the dirty ones the space is not enough. Usually this is due to packing them in an ugly way like the ways you mentioned (ball them or putting them in shoe bags). </p>

<p>The best thing I have always been doing and it always worked and I never had space problem is by folding them as if they were clean, then put them in a plastic bag, squeeze the air out of the plastic bag and seal it. Squeezing the air will make it less bulky. This way you will not need more space than what you needed when you first packed them and it will not mix with your new clothes and smell (if available) will not spread all over the bag. If no plastic bag available you can do the same with a laundry bag (usually available in the cupboards in hotels). </p>

<p>Anyway, putting clothes in a plastic bag and squeezing the air out is also good idea for clean clothes to save space. </p>

  <p>Service was launched at the end of 2012. High season route only (operating Nov - April). Check in point located inside the Kuah Jetty (located in Kuah Town) on the Pattaya Beach. Travel Time 10 hrs.</p>
  
  <p>Bookings can be made in person at a booth on the pier road in Chalong or by various payment methods over the internet. It appears there is no luggage restriction as there would be when flying. The ferry stops and collects at Koh Lipe (immigration clearance), Trang (30 minute break), Koh Mook, Koh Kradan, Koh Ngai, Koh Lanta, Koh Phi Phi (7 stops in total).</p>
  
  <p>The Malaysia Immigration &amp; Customs officials are located inside the jetty. If you do not check-in at least 60 minutes prior to departure, you will not be allowed on board of our ferry.</p>

"Tactics to avoid getting harassed by corrupt police?","14249","","<p>In Uzbekistan I was stopped, searched and questioned six times in one day.</p>

<p>At the border with Tajikistan, one official tried hiding my paperwork to elicit something from me.</p>

<p>In Kyrgyzstan, I was physically harassed and detained by the police, and about US$30 taken while they searched everything on me and a Dutch backpacker I was going to get food with.</p>

<p>I'm not particularly dodgy looking - it's happening to a lot of backpackers I meet.  Tourists are apparently a prime target for corrupt officials.</p>

<p>Any suggestions or tactics for avoiding these occurrences?  Aside from carrying only photocopies of your passport so that they can't hold your passport ransom, I've not heard many successful tips...</p>
","<p>I live in a very corrupt country - Ukraine. Let me give you some advice.</p>

<ol>
<li>Try to avoid looking like a stranger. Try to look like the locals. That is often difficult, I know.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is the only advice I can give on how to <strong>avoid</strong> corrupt police. They often search for strangers just to get some money from them, because strangers are easy meat. All the other advice is how to <strong>deal</strong> with bribes and police.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>The key is your behavior</strong>. In corrupt countries, it is very important to behave like you are a very important authority. Corrupt policemen are afraid of their bosses only. You need to make them think that you can contact local authorities or your embassy to ask for help. This where the second tip comes from.</li>
<li>Take your local <strong>embassy phone numbers</strong> with you. Call them whenever any problem with bribes and corruption happens. In my experience, that mostly helps, however it depends on the embassy. All developed countries have very good embassies and own citizen's protection mechanisms.</li>
<li>If you are forced to give bribes to police, then <strong>ask the police officers to help you to avoid all future problems</strong> with other officers. They are mostly happy to help you with that. It's like a deal, you give him a bribe - he helps you in the future. Take their phone numbers, for example, in order to call them when the next police officer harasses you.</li>
<li>I believe it is very important to have an <strong>interpreter</strong> with you. Without one, you'll be harassed too often. And make sure the interpreter also behaves like alpha-male.</li>
<li>The bribe value for strangers is usually 10 times higher than for locals. So, you can <strong>bargain</strong> with them. For example, a $30 USD bribe could be $3 USD.</li>
<li><strong>Never give your IDs</strong> or papers to police. Just show your documents and refuse to give them. That works in all ex-USSR countries.</li>
<li>Try to <strong>never leave your car</strong> to talk to police. Talk through the window only.</li>
<li>If they frighten you with a gun - they have broken a very serious law. Unfastening a holster, talking about their guns - that's what I'm talking about. Call the embassy immediately. However, I've never heard of a policeman who broke that law.</li>
<li><strong>Never run away</strong> from police. In this case, you can get into a lot of trouble.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is not a complete list, of course, but I tried to make it as descriptive as possible.</p>

<p>To summarize, I'd like to remind you that <em>your dominating behavior</em> is the key.</p>

"(Where) Can I go to a ""sleeper"" cinema?","14189","","<p>I came upon an <a href=""http://www.boredpanda.com/beautiful-cinemas-around-the-world/#post0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">article going around Facebook</a> which shows some unusual cinemas around the world. The first photo shows a number of movie-goers lying in beds watching a flick:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0lQCM.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The article offers sparse details, at best, only claiming the location is ""Olympia Music Hall, France"" and a comment says ""It was actually an event held by IKEA in France.""</p>

<p>Are there any cinemas that do this regularly?</p>
","<p>The depicted is not a regular event or an ongoing promotion.</p>

<p>In 2010, IKEA staged a promotion called <em><a href=""http://vimeo.com/13356726"">In Bed with IKEA</a></em> at the <a href=""http://www.olympiahall.com/"">Olympia</a> concert hall in Paris, in which the seats were replaced with a new bed and mattress line they were promoting. In late 2014, they staged a similar event called <em><a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russian-cinema-teams-up-with-ikea-to-offer-movies-in-bed-9920083.html"">Cinema of Love</a></em> at <a href=""http://www.kinostardelux.ru/"">Kinostar De Lux</a> in Khimki just outside Moscow. </p>

<p>The nearest I found to a real ""bed"" in a cinema is offered by Blitz Megaplex of Indonesia. They provide ""<a href=""http://www.blitzmegaplex.com/en/schedule_class_velvet.php"">Velvet Class</a>"" amenities at several Jakarta locations featuring ""lux sofabeds"" with ""fluffy pillows"" and ""warm and comfy blanket.""</p>

<p>Beyond this, I found few offerings that could genuinely be called a <em>bed</em>. There are numerous theatres which offer sofas or day beds where a couple or small family can share a seat, from <a href=""http://www.landmarktheatres.com/los-angeles/the-landmark/info"">The Landmark</a> in Los Angeles to the Portobello Road location of <a href=""http://www.electriccinema.co.uk/"">Electric Cinema</a> in London to a number of Bangkok's ""<a href=""http://travel.cnn.com/bangkok/play/bangkok-city-essentials/best-bangkok-vip-movie-theaters-270103"">VIP cinemas</a>"" like <a href=""http://www.sfcinemacity.com/index.php/th/cinema/location"">SF Cinema City</a> and <a href=""http://www.majorcineplex.com/cinema/paragon-cineplex"">Paragon Cineplex</a>.</p>

<p>For a further possibility, there are <a href=""http://www.tgv.com.my/cinemas/halls/beanie.html"">TGV Beanie</a> halls in Malaysia fitted with beanbag couches.</p>

<hr>

<p>If you expand the criteria further to fully-reclining seats, the venues quickly become too many to list. Even very ""Middle America"" chains like AMC and Regal are installing <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/now-at-the-movies-fully-reclining-seats-1404679140"">leather recliners</a> to try to improve margins amidst declining moviegoing audiences; you can find them even in plain Jane suburbs like Beltsville, Maryland or Dublin, Ohio.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QfFuA.png"" alt=""map of flight path""></p>
","<p>Pretty darn safe.  Most terrorism or problems in those countries is on the ground.  Yes some people might have SAMs (surface to air missiles) but the odds of them even seeing you at 800km/hr+ and 33000ft+ and hitting getting you is not worth considering. They wouldn't waste their weaponry trying.</p>

<p>When a place is considered too dangerous to fly, there are several people who might stop this - the airline themselves, the pilots (if they see something) and even international bodies or countries.  All have considered it and feel it's safe for you to fly there.</p>

"UK Immigration officers arrivals interview questions","14122","","<p>When interviewing arrivals seeking entry, what questions do UK Immigration offices ask?</p>

So a full interview will cover purpose, length, maintenance, accommodation, returnability, and overstay risk.</p>

<p>Assuming you present a valid passport, your landing interview will go something along the lines of...</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the purpose of your visit?</li>
<li>How long will you be staying?</li>
<li>Are you meeting friends here? Are they waiting outside?</li>
<li>Where will you be staying?</li>
<li>Do you have reservations there? May I see them?</li>
<li>How will you pay for your visit?</li>
<li>Do you have your bank statements with you? May I see them?</li>
<li>What is your job? May I see your employment contract? Salary slips?</li>
<li>Will you be working remotely?</li>
<li>Do you have a return ticket? May I see it?</li>
<li>Do you have a bf/gf here? </li>
<li>Enjoy your visit</li>
</ul>

<p>Any of these questions can trigger a more intensive line of questioning; or alternatively any of these can satisfy the IO that your intentions are genuine and end the interview there.  You didn't mention your job or life-style, but there are slight variations of the interview for students, families, unemployed, people pursuing romantic liaisons, attending job interviews, business meetings, seeking medical treatment, and so on.</p>

<p>The outcome of the interview depends largely upon personal impact and articulation skills along with your document preparation.</p>

<p>If you are successful, the IO will affix an '<a href=""http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/77/section/33"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">entry certificate</a>' to a blank area in your passport.  It bestows 'leave to enter' and comes in the form of a rectangular rubber stamp.  It summarizes the conditions of your leave and its expiry date.  In the argot of UK immigration, this means you have been ""landed"".</p>

<p>For a detailed analysis of what goes through the IO's mind, you can read ""<a href=""http://www.statewatch.org/news/2007/jan/uk-ho-immig-decision-making-study.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Exploring the decision making of Immigration Officers</a>""</p>

<p>People arriving with entry clearances (i.e., visa nationals) can expect some of the introductory questions, but the landing interview will be not as intrusive because the UK has already checked you out and given you permission to enter.</p>

"Can I enter other Schengen countries with EU residence permit but without passport?","14114","","<p>I have some travel plans to go from Netherlands to France by car. I possess Dutch residence permit, but I am non-EU citizen. The problem is that I might need to submit my passport to get visa to another country I plan to go to later. So I have: residence permit and photocopy of my passport. Is it </p>

<ol>
<li>legal to cross borders by car with this set of documents</li>
<li>what are possible fines and other repercussions if police or other authorities ask for my documents in France or Belgium?</li>
</ol>
","<p>Legally speaking, you need a valid passport or equivalent travel document to cross any border of a Schengen state, whether it's an inner or outer border of the Schengen area. I can't find a list of equivalent travel documents for France, but <a href=""http://www.esteri.it/MAE/EN/Ministero/Servizi/Stranieri/IngressoSoggiornoInItalia/Passaporti_documenti.htm"">the one for Italy</a> only lists “exotic” alternatives — documents for refugees, for seafarers, etc. (Nationals of an EU country and a few others need only an identity card).</p>

<p>In practice, borders inside the Schengen area are not equipped for systematic checks and there is a high likelihood that you'll just drive through without even noticing that you've passed the border. There are (or used to be) occasional checks for drug smuggling on the road from the Netherlands to France; I doubt that it's a problem if all you can show is a driving license. It's better if you have your residence permit and a photocopy of your passport — with these documents, it would take exceptional to get into trouble.</p>

<p>As far as I know, there is no direct penalty for not carrying an identity document in France. (I know that for nationals; I think it's also true for non-nationals.) There is an obligation that you must be able to prove your identity upon request (technically, the request has to be justified, but in practice a police officer can always find a pretext). As a non-national, you'd also have to prove your right to be there, as otherwise you could be detained and expelled. Again, with a proof of identity such as a driving license, plus a copy of your passport and residence permit, you are very unlikely to get into trouble.</p>

<p>The one thing you cannot reliably do without a passport is fly. All commercial airlines require a passport (or identity card), even for Schengen internal flights. They often don't check, but if they do, they're likely to not let you board the flight if you don't have documentation that's acceptable to them.</p>

<p>As others have mentioned, the US tracks exits by gathering data from the airlines and other carriers.  However, because the US doesn't have exit controls, the system can easily be defeated.  See, for example, the New York Times article <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/02/us/politics/us-doesnt-know-how-many-foreign-visitors-overstay-visas.html"">U.S. Doesn’t Know How Many Foreign Visitors Overstay Visas</a>.</p>

<p>A visitor to the US could fool the system by checking in for an international flight (for example, to London) and then swapping boarding passes with someone on a domestic flight (for example, to Chicago).  The visitor then flies to Chicago, and the confederate flies to London.  The US government believes that the vistor has left the country, but in fact, the visitor is in Chicago.</p>

"Traveling from Newark to Philadelphia, train or bus","14107","","<p>I would be landing in Newark Airport with an international flight on Thursday at 16:40 PM, planning to get to UPenn immediately after. </p>

I wanted to take an Amtrak train from the airport to Philadelphia 30th Street Station, but there are no available trains that allow checked baggage, and my suitcase is larger than the size allowed on board.</p>

<p>Are there any other options for traveling by train with a suitcase?
Can I find buses between those two points? If so, where? and are suitcases allowed on buses?</p>
","<p>How large is your suitcase? Amtrak's carry-on rules, historically speaking, are <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/8125/how-rigorous-are-amtrak-in-enforcing-luggage-rules"">loosely enforced</a> compared to the airlines. They announced a stricter policy  as of October 1, 2015, but it is still quite generous— two bags weighing up to 50 pounds (22.7 kg) each plus two personal items weighing up to 25 pounds (11.3kg) each for free, then $20 for additional items or items above the quantity and size limits. </p>

<p>On Amtrak, ""no checked luggage"" means that you cannot check your bags with Amtrak (e.g. if the train has no baggage car); you can still bring them onboard and look after them yourself. Some long-distance trains that run on parts of the Northeast Corridor (e.g. the Cardinal, Silver Service, the Vermonter) do have baggage cars, but all will have overhead racks as well as shelves at the end of each car where you can stash your bags.</p>

<p>As of 2015 there are no intercity buses to Philadelphia which depart <a href=""http://www.panynj.gov/airports/ewr-public-transportation.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">directly from EWR</a> (<a href=""http://www.transbridgelines.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Trans Bridge Lines</a> only serves some Northeast and Central Pennsylvania destinations).

The $30 or so for a taxi may be worth it, but note that you would be arriving after the start of rush hour. </p>

<p>Note also that the Greyhound station in Philadelphia is located near the <a href=""http://www.septa.org/stations/rail/market.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Market East Station</a>, not 30th Street Station. To get to UPenn you'd need to take the <a href=""http://www.septa.org/service/mfl/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Market-Frankford Line</a> from 11th Street. BoltBus and Megabus stop at JFK and 30th Street near 30th Street Station, which is a longish walk to Penn; with a large bag at night, a taxi may be a better idea.

<p>I did some post graduate work at Ruprecht-Karls-Universität and am <em>intimately</em> aware that there are societies who arrange both public and  clandestine rendez-vous's near the ruins of the <a href=""http://www.schloss-heidelberg.de/en/home/"">ancient castle</a> which now forms a part of the <a href=""http://www.heidelberg.de/hd,Lde/HD/Erleben/Stadtwald.html"">Heidelberg Municipal Park</a>.</p>

<p>Sometimes taking place at these events are sabre duels conducted for sport, pleasure, and bragging rights. And one desired outcome of a sabre duel is rakishly attractive duelling scar. When delivered in the right setting, these scars are 'authentic' because they echo a centuries old tradition in central European folklore.  Also, not just Heidelberg, there are (or were) hundreds these societies throughout central Europe and all of them can stake a claim to 'authenticity'. There's an interesting photo of a  <a href=""http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/7957/324/1600/107526/Dueling_scar-2.jpg"">contemporary dueller with a fresh wound here</a>. </p>

<p>I never gave a thought to whether or not these activities were accessible to tourists. And in all cases, if there are any legal boundaries that might intervene one's plans.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: how would a tourist go about arranging an authentic duelling scar on relatively short notice?  Say 'short notice' means 3 months or less.  I am aware that I could go to a doctor or even do it myself, but this would not be <em>authentic</em>.</p>

<p>Also, these things <strong>hurt</strong> and in addition to requiring stitches, you can't shave that side of your face for about 12 days (most often and counter intuitively the left side, but sometimes the right side). Are there other precautions a tourist should take note of (e.g., applying local aesthetic prior to the event or stocking up on pain killers or getting one's clothes cleaned afterwards or what to wear)?</p>

<p>Note that protective clothing is handled as a part of the tradition and provided by the society. But protective gear in modern times is no where near as baroque as  American novelist <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Twain"">Mark Twain</a> described it...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The duelers eyes are protected by iron goggles which project an inch or more.  The leather straps of the goggles bind their ears flat against their heads and these straps are wound around and around with thick wrappings which a sword could not cut through.  From chin to ankle they are padded thoroughly against injury; their arms are bandaged and rebandaged, layer upon layer, until they look like solid black logs.  They resembled beings one sees in nightmares. Their arms which projected straight out from their bodies are so heavy that fellow-students walk beside them and help to support them.</p>

<p><strong>Secondarily</strong>: is it legal for a tourist to participate in a clandestine sabre duel?  Or even publicly announced sabre duel? I am informed that there are also public events, but do not know if the authorities will allow tourists to participate.</p>

<p>Further research: Wiki article, ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dueling_scar"">Dueling Scar</a>""</p>
","<p>The short answer is: you can't.  </p>

<p>As an ""honorary"" member of a Burschenschaft, I fought two duels in Freiburg in 1988, leaving me with a prominent Schmiss on my right cheek (11 stitches) and a small one (one stitch) that probably wont be noticeable even if and when I go bald.  I've probably witnessed over 100 duels.  Though a lot of time has passed since I did this, I suspect things haven't changed very much.  </p>

<p>Here's what you would need to do to even have the opportunity to get a duelling scar:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Join a duelling fraternity, or Schlagende Verbindung.  Though I would later be offered full membership, I was able to become an ""honorary"" member of a Burschenschaft by virtue of a German great-great-grandmother (and because my father knew a German Navy officer who was an alumnus).  A Burschenschaft is typically not going to admit you if you're not German.   For the Burschenschaft that I belonged, you had to have completed your Wehrdienst, or compulsory military service - those who chose non-military service (at a hospital or rest home, etc) could not join.  So you'd need to find a Landsmannschaft or some other duelling organization that would let you join.  Most Verbindungen are NOT of the duelling type.  You have to be a student at the university in order to join, but foreigners are more welcome in the Landsmannschaft and Corps organizations.</p></li>
<li><p>After joining, you would need to do a lot of training before you would be approved for a duel.  Its all about correct form and style - the objective is actually NOT to slice open the other guy (nor is it to get hit yourself !!) - and maintaining it no matter what happens during the duel.  Typically you'll have your ""basic"" duel (""Fuchs Partei"") in which only basic strikes are allowed; the ""Burschen Partei"" is the second type of duel, in which nifty things like horizontal blows are allowed.  Training for this kind of duel typically takes a year.</p></li>
<li><p>In a basic duel, often no blood is even drawn - and because the strikes must come only from above (in Freiburg - other universities can differ in their protocol), even if you are hit, the scar likely wont be visible afterwards.  Its not until the advanced class of duels that things get interesting - the cheeks and foreheads (and top of the ears) are vulnerable to horizontal blows, which are much more difficult to defend against.  Now, I'm sure someone, somewhere, at some point, actually WANTED to get hit during a duel.  However, you're OBLIGATED to perform at your best, so willfully allowing your guard down in order to receive a sharp hit would be an egregious breach of protocol.  But by the time you've prepared for an advanced duel, your training simply kicks in - there's no time to think about your reactions because of the extremely fast alternation of strikes.  </p></li>
<li><p>As with every endeavor in life, people will have different skill levels.  So opponents are carefully chosen by a council of representatives from different Verbindungen (you never duel someone from your own) and you will face someone the same height, speed, and strength.  You don't get to choose your opponent, and you don't go around challenging others to duels any longer.  Duels are carefully arranged and there is no antagonism between opponents.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Let me comment on a few other topics in the OP :</p>

<p>Duels are categorically NOT public events, and instead take place inside a Verbindungshaus, in a large room that can accommodate the duellists, their seconds, the guy who cleans off your sword after each round, the doctors, and many observers.  Attendance will be restricted to only those from other local duelling organizations - recognizable by the unique color band you wear across your chest as well as your matching hat.  If you're not from a Schlagende Verbindung, wearing your colors (and a jacket and tie), you won't be allowed in.  Period.</p>

<p>There are no publicly announced duels.  </p>

<p>Duels are not fought with sabres any longer (sabres have curved blades) but with straight blades of varying weights about 1m long.  Only the tip and about a third of the blade is sharpened, on both sides.  Its entirely possible to hit someone with the flat part of the blade, which actually hurts more than getting hit with the sharp part.  A blade (""Klinge"") is used for only one duel.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""I'm aware that I could go to a doctor or even do it myself….but this would not be authentic…""  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are correct.  (Hmmm)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Protective gear in modern times is nowhere near as baroque…""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, Mark Twain's description is pretty spot-on - though most serious duelling groups will have made an investment in chainmail vest ($$$), which gives a lot more freedom of movement than conventional old leather.  Also its easier to clean the blood off.  </p>

<p>The ""iron goggles that project an inch or more"" nowadays have a nose protector that can be attached, but otherwise probably look the same as when Mr. Twain described them.  A leather strap holds the goggles to your head, and its cinched very tight to prevent a blade from taking out an eye.  The neck is protected by a heavy leather collar also cinched very tight.  Upper body is protected by thick leather and sometimes chain mail over that.  Striking arm is protected by thick leather padding.</p>

<p>The top of the head and the cheeks are left unprotected - these are the target zones.</p>

<p>There is no lunging around.  Opponents stand one blade length from each other and only the striking arm is allowed to move.  You cannot move your upper body or head at all.  The worst thing you can do  is to try and duck a blow - you're automatically disqualified if you do that.  It's not good.</p>

<p>Getting hit doesn't hurt.  Getting sewed up without anesthetic does.  Forget painkillers since they would make you too slow.  You aren't even supposed to drink 24 hours before the duel and if you get solidly hit, you'll only be allowed a couple of cold ones after the duel.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""most often and counter intuitively the left side…""  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, think about that for a moment; it makes perfect sense - a right-handed opponent will strike most of their horizontal blows to their opponent's left side.  A wound on the right side is normally the result of two lefties duelling.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""how would a tourist go about arranging an authentic duelling scar…""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You just can't.  And three months would be way too fast even for a member of a duelling Verbindung - in Freiburg people would practice for most of the year before their basic duel, and then would work a couple more months on horizontal strikes before being pronounced ready for an advanced duel  (I gained some notoriety back then as the only American who had fought two duels as well as the fastest time between basic and advanced - 2 weeks)  </p>

<p>And remember, not every duel results in a scar!</p>

<p>(Although I suppose you could pay someone to hit you in the face with a duelling blade)</p>

<p>Ironically, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUh5exBJXBU"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> Italian documentary film from the sixties is still the best I've found. Skip ahead to 2:30 for the duel portion.</p>

<p>Are flexible tickets never worth it, or am I missing something? Lufthansa definitely does everything in order not to tell me what the rebooking fee is.</p>
","<p>I can't speak specifically to Lufthansa, but with some experience on other airlines - if you change your flight on a saver-style fare, you pay a change fee and the difference between the fares.  </p>

<p>If you are close to the date of travel the saver fares are generally sold out, so you are paying the difference between saver and flexi, and often a ""we've got limited seats"" premium on top of that because of airline yield management, e.g. buying six months out may save you 500 euros or more compared to a change two weeks out.  </p>

<p>Looking at Lufthansa's website, the same flight is 2,146 euros in two weeks time, so using that and your totals as an example, a late change might result in overall payment of:</p>

<pre><code> 550 (saver) + 125 (fee) + (2146 - 550) (new fare minus original) = 2,271 euros
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously this is substantially more than the 1,300 euros for purchasing a flexi fare to begin with.</p>

"What are the best seat places to choose inside an international flight for economy class?","14050","","<p>Considering that I can choose any seat on any seat row on a Boeing 777-300ER for an international flight, I have most of 400 seat places to choose from the forefront to the last row of <a href=""http://www.seatguru.com/airlines/KLM/KLM_Boeing_777-300ER.php"">this airplane</a>. What are the best options if I bought an economy class ticket, traveling in a group of 4 people and if I want two windows? Are there any advantages in choosing the last places instead of the front ones?</p>
","<p>This is a very difficult question to answer in general, because different airlines have different seating configurations, seat pitches, etc. The best thing to do is to check out sites dedicated to airline seating plans, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.seatguru.com/"">SeatGuru</a> (by far one of the most popular ones)</li>
<li><a href=""http://seatexpert.com/"">SeatExpert</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://www.seatplans.com/"">SeatPlans</a></li>
</ul>

<p>All of these sites are built on a user-submitted database + aircraft seat plan data on what the best seats in an airplane are, according to aircraft type, passenger class, short/long haul sectors etc. I see that you've already checked SeatGuru; beyond that, you may also want to check one of the others ones to see if SeatGuru's missed out anything. Usually, they're pretty standard.</p>

<p>For economy class, unless you have extra legroom or reduced recline or proximity to galleys / toilets, there literally isn't much that distinguishes one seat from another. After that, it all boils down to personal choices. I usually like aisle seats for extra legroom. The back of an airplane will experience more G-force during ascents, so some people prefer seats towards the front of the aircraft. And so on.</p>

<p>Everyone likes extra legroom, but as an economy class passenger even if you check-in online, chances are you won't get those seats on long haul flights because many airlines open up online check-in for those in higher frequent flyer tiers earlier. This gets easier to snag if you're a solo traveller because it's much more likely to find singleton seats later in the checkin process.</p>

<p>When travelling with four people, on your flight the middle row will allow you all to sit together. If you want two window seats, then it's going to be quite awkward if you plan to talk during the journey. My advice? It's a long haul flight. People around you won't like people chatting. Tune in to the in-flight entertainment system, read a book, or just zone out on any seat you get. </p>

","<p>The answer as to what is allowed or not allowed into a country varies depending on the specific item, the country, and sometimes even the specific port/airport you're entering through.</p>

<p>The most important thing to remember is that you should always DECLARE what you are bringing in.  Almost every country has a question on the entry/customs form regarding food, and generally ""food"" is defined as anything that you can eat - even things like snacks/candy bars/teas/herbs/etc - and specifically things like Pot Noodle!</p>

<p>As long as you declare it, and as long as it's not something outright illegal (eg, drugs) then the worst that can happen is that they can confiscate it if it's something that is not allowed through that point of entry. You will not be fined/arrested/denied entry/etc if you've declared it, but you could be if you do not declare it.</p>

<p>Specifically for Pot Noodles, I suspect you'll be fine as long as they don't contain meat.  The Canadian Government's ""Be Aware and Declare"" website has a list of <a href=""http://www.beaware.gc.ca/english/brirape.shtml#a2"">allowed food products</a> and the only restrictions that seem to be relevant are ""no goods containing meat"" and no milk or milk products (""dried, frozen, reconsituted, or fresh"") .  I'd be fairly sure Pot Noodles wouldn't contain either of those, and even if they did I doubt it would be in sufficient quantities for them to be rejected.</p>

<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rSF6J.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here"">
Stay away from Kuta beach since it usually very crowded.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A lot of people speak english</strong> </p>

<p>Bali's main income is tourism. And most of the local able to speak English because of that.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wide variety of Indonesian food</strong></p>

<p>Bali provides various food from 32 provinces in Indonesia. And you can also find western/Japanese/US Fast food store here.</p>

<p>Even the local are renting their motorbike. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>The country is big enough to stay 5-7 weeks.</strong> 
Indonesia is 3-4 times bigger than Thailand.
You can also go to Lombok which less touristy using ship/boat from Bali. It's very near to Bali.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Friendly native people</strong></p>

<p>Bali is the friendliest province in Indonesia. 
You can also see how friendly the native are in ""Eat Pray Love"" movie by Julia Roberts.

<p>Thai is well know of it's Buddhism culture. Meanwhile, Bali is well known of it's Hinduism culture.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>One suggestion though : Do not come during Nyepi ( a special day for Balinese ). On that day, Balinese usually stay at home, doing nothing - no one allowed to go outside the house. They also enforce the rule to the tourist. In case you really need to go during Nyepi, my advise is choose resort so you could still doing your activities inside the resort.</p>

"Are there still any “Fly as much as you like” air passes for the U.S.?","14008","","<p>Back in 1993 I had a ticket called 'Delta Air Lines Travel America Standby Airpass' that allowed me to take an unlimited number of flights on Delta Airlines within a 30 day period. 60 days were available as well.</p>

<p>There were some conditions:</p>

<ul>
<li>You had to purchase the pass along with a transatlantic flight
(possibly other long distance flights into the U.S. worked as well
and they did not necessarily had to be with the same airline)</li>
<li>You could not be a resident of the U.S. or Canada</li>
<li>You could only use flights within the continental U.S.</li>
<li>Your seat was not guaranteed, when showing up at the airport you
would get added to the bottom of the stand-by passengers list, but
most of the time, this was not a problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>I know that at the time other airlines besides Delta had the same kind of passes, but do they still exist today?</p>

<p>It seems today air passes work differently, you have to buy coupons for a predefined route. The price depends on the distance and number of flights. An example is the <a href=""http://www.staralliance.com/en/fares/regional-fares/north-america-airpass/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Star Alliance North America Airpass</a></p>

<p>That's not what I am looking for, I like the unlimited 'Fly as much as you can' pass.</p>

<p>If there is a positive answer to this, it may also be a good answer to the question <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/q/31/1317"">'Sightseeing the USA by air'</a></p>
","<p>These types of passes have not existed for many years.</p>

<p>JetBlue has run an ""All You Can Jet"" deal on a few occasions over the past few years, but it's only been run for specific dates rates (ie, not any 30 days you want) and is fairly restrictive.</p>

<p>The odds of anyone bringing back something like you've described is fairly low due to the current state of US air travel.  ""Standby"" travel (in the form you've described) is basically non-existent now days due to reduced numbers of flights resulting in much higher ""loads"" than in past years.  For some specific routes - especially those between hubs - you could be waiting days or (at some times of year) even weeks to get a standby seat on a flight.</p>

<p>As you've stated, ""Air Passes"" are the current equivalent of what you're describing, but they are priced based on segments and distance - not an ""all-you-can-eat"" type of deal. Star Alliance (United, Continental, US Air), OneWorld (American Airlines), SkyTeam (Delta), Alaska Airlines and others all has some form of Air Pass program - normally only available to non-US residents when bought in conjunction with an airfare to the US.</p>

"Australian permanent resident countries to visit without visa","14000","","<p>I have some friends who are PR of Australia and I wonder what countries allows Australian permanent residents to visit without a visa? I know that New Zealand doesn't require a visa for Australian permanent residents, but are there any other countries?
Also does being an Australian Permanent resident give any advantages when applying for any visa? Like what are the travelling benefits an Australian Permanent resident has?</p>
","<p>Most visitor visa regimes are based solely on citizenship, with permanent resident status having no effect.  There are some exceptions, however, where countries that have unusually close relationships will waive visa requirements for one another's permanent residents.  The exceptions I know of concern certain cases in the EU, and US permanent residents, who do not need visas for short visits to Canada.  I was unaware of a similar arrangement between Australia and New Zealand, but I am not surprised to learn about it.</p>

<p>I don't know of any other countries that exempt Australian permanent residents from a visitor visa requirement.</p>

<p>Transit visas are another matter.  Many countries will waive transit visa requirements for those with permanent resident status in certain ""developed"" countries, such as Australia.

","<p>There are two issues that sometimes get confused:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>What's allowed on the plane</strong> - This is determined by <strong>security</strong> rules. If a prescription drug is not a liquid that takes you over the liquids limit, then it's allowed. If it takes you over the limit, it's generally still allowed as long as you can prove that it was prescribed to you. Prescription drugs in pill form are not a problem at all.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What's allowed into the country / EU</strong> - This is determined by <strong>customs</strong> rules of each individual country. I don't know the exact EU rules, but I would guess it's similar to US/Canada rules, where less than 1 month supply of a prescription drug is certainly ok, but for some stronger/psychoactive drugs you need to have proof of prescription.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In any case, DO NOT try and hide the fact that it's Xanax by putting it into another bottle, etc. Anything like this will just be a red flag for any official, either security or customs.

"Australian to Japanese power converter?","13939","","<p>I am planning to charge my phone and camera while in Japan and am wondering if I will need to purchase a power socket converter? Also, is the wattage in Japan the same as Australian power sockets?</p>
","<p>Well, The power socket is different, In Japan it is <a href=""http://electricaloutlet.org/type-a"" rel=""noreferrer"">Type A</a> and <a href=""http://electricaloutlet.org/type-a"" rel=""noreferrer"">Type B</a> while it is <a href=""http://electricaloutlet.org/type-i"" rel=""noreferrer"">Type I</a> in Asutralia according to <a href=""http://electricaloutlet.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">electricaloutlet.org</a>.</p>

<p>The real problem here is the voltage, In Japan its 100V and in Australia it is 240V. Almost all phone, camera and laptop chargers are dual voltage and would work in any electricity from 100-240V but that's not the case for almost all other electrical devices.

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/irb20.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Since in Australia is 240V and in Japan is 100V then there will be no damage to your devices if you plug an Australian device in Japan even though it will not work. Anyway the opposite (if you plug a 100V device into 240V power socket) will lead to fireworks show so in case you are planning to buy electrical devices from Japan make sure it supports 240V.</p>

<p>What's the safest way to dry the passport without damaging? I don't want to risk making it unusable.</p>
","<p>You could dry the pages with paper towels as much as possible, then hang it to dry on a string with the pages spread out or separated by bits of paper towel- don't leave them in contact with each other wet or they may stick together. Change the paper towels for dry ones periodically as it dries.</p>

<p>You could also put it in a container with some silica gel, but buying that tends to be a bit of expedition even if you live in the place you're looking (some craft stores sell it for drying flowers). Or put it in sealed container with (uncooked, of course) rice, but always keep wet pages from spending too much time in contact by using paper towels. </p>

"What point on the main land of The Netherlands is furthest away from any buildings?","13827","","<p>Living in The Netherlands, I know my country is a crowded one. I typically can't leave a town for a couple of steps before arriving in the next one. So I was wondering,</p>

<p><strong>Where in The Netherlands am I furthest away from any city or town?</strong></p>

<p>I know that the Wadden Islands group of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rottum_(island_group)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Rottum</a> is a pretty good contender, but I want to limit this to the main land, where you could actually walk for a mile or so &mdash; neither of the islands is big enough for more than a stroll.</p>

<p>Also, there's of course a difference between the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Built-up_area_(Highway_Code)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">built-up area</a> of a town (""bebouwde kom"" in Dutch), and other buildings such as farms. Ideally, I'd like to see both points of view addressed: where am I farthest away from regular towns, and where am I farthest away from any building it all?</p>
","<p>To know where you are the furthest from any building in the Netherlands is very simple. </p>

<h2>Buildings in The Netherlands</h2>

<p>First of all, you look where all the buildings in the Netherlands are. That is here.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sECmI.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sECmI.png"" alt=""Buildings in the Netherlands""></a></p>

<p>In this picture I represented every building in the Netherlands by a little almost transparent dot. So the black spots is where multiple of those spots overlap. You see some very nice structures in the map. The big white spot in the center of the country is the Veluwe that was mentioned in many other answers. But as you can see, the central part contains some buildings that might kill its top position.</p>

<p>So lets make all dots fully opaque to make sure we don't miss a tiny almost transparent dot. Which gives</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GTt3Q.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GTt3Q.png"" alt=""Again buildings in the Netherlands""></a></p>

<p>Now, we would like to know where we are the furthest from any of those buildings. One option would be to create buffers around each building and increase the size until only one bit of the Netherlands is not covered.<br>
Or to rasterize and get for each raster point the distance to the nearest building. Details of those methods should be asked on <a href=""http://gis.stackexchange.com"">gis</a>.</p>

<p>I have used the poor mans version of a buffer: use bigger dots! If we quadruple the dots in size the picture becomes this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/keHTH.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/keHTH.png"" alt=""Buildings in the Netherlands. Big dots.""></a></p>

<h2>The locations</h2>

<p>Now we see which places win. Technically it will be the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afsluitdijk"" rel=""noreferrer"">Afsluitdijk</a> and the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houtribdijk"" rel=""noreferrer"">Houtribdijk</a> (between Enkhuizen and Lelystad). But those are just motorways on a tiny strip of land. That would be a very disappointing remotest place, so let's pretend we didn't see that.</p>

<p>On the islands it is the Eastern tip of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schiermonnikoog"" rel=""noreferrer"">Schiermonnikoog</a> that wins. A very quiet place and you can take a decent walk, but the OP excluded the islands.</p>

<p>On the mainland there are four remaining interesting locations:</p>

<h3>The Veluwe</h3>

<p>This is the furthest from buildings that you will get on the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veluwe"" rel=""noreferrer"">Veluwe</a>.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UkHNS.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UkHNS.png"" alt=""Veluwe""></a></p>

<p>This is the region <a href=""http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=13/52.2861/5.8480"" rel=""noreferrer"">East of Elspeet</a>. You will get there around 1.5 km away from any building. Not bad, but we had other promising candidates.</p>

<h3>Lauwersmeer</h3>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/cjpCz.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/cjpCz.png"" alt=""Lauwersmeer""></a></p>

<p>Hey, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauwersmeer"" rel=""noreferrer"">Lauwermeer</a> is something we haven't heard yet in the other answers. It beats the more popular Veluwe. <a href=""http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=13/53.3523/6.2102"" rel=""noreferrer"">Smack in the middle</a> you would be about 1.8 km away from any building.</p>

<h3>Saeftinghe</h3>

<p>After the <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/a/87919/13052"">great post by Belle</a> we shouldn't forget the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saeftinghe"" rel=""noreferrer"">Verdronken Land Van Saeftinghe</a>. It suffers a bit from the presence of buildings on the Eastern edge, but <a href=""http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=13/51.3484/4.1700"" rel=""noreferrer"">in the center</a> you will get about 2km away from any buildings.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DiStw.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DiStw.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<h3>Oostvaardersplassen</h3>

<p>The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oostvaardersplassen"" rel=""noreferrer"">Oostvaardersplassen</a> are winning.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/C9IgU.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/C9IgU.png"" alt=""Oostvaardersplassen""></a></p>

<p><a href=""http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=13/52.4481/5.3493"" rel=""noreferrer"">Along the Oostvaardersdijk</a>, next to the Oostvaardersplassen you can get as far as 3km away from any buildings. If you want to exclude that for the same reasons as we excluded the Afsluitdijk and the Houtribdijk, you could go the other side of the ""plassen"" and still be well over 2.5km away from any buildings.</p>

<h3>Where to take your walk?</h3>

<p>For that little stroll that you had in mind, the Veluwe would be the best option. Neither the Oostvaardersplassen nor Lauwersmeer have walking paths near those remotest parts. They are easier to reach with a kind of boat of your choice.</p>

<h3>What about built-up area?</h3>

<p>That won't significantly change it. If you look at the maps, you will see that the nearest built-up area is not very far behind the nearest building for each of those places. You will probably get the furthest away from built-up areas by going to the North-Eastern corner of Saeftinghe.</p>

<h2>Sources and such</h2>

<p>The buildings were extracted from OpenStreetMap, using the most recent Geofabrik builds. In the Netherlands the buildings are in OpenStreetMap are very complete because the official BAG dataset was imported. In other countries the inconsistent quality of the OpenStreetMap data will be a big challenge to repeat this analysis.</p>

<p>The maps that were used as a background are the Bing Maps. All images are my own work.</p>

<h3>Some more details, as per request</h3>

<p>Download data from <a href=""http://download.geofabrik.de/europe/netherlands.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Geofabrik</a>. I used the zip with the shape files. Open the shape file with the buildings in your favourite GIS. I used <a href=""http://www.qgis.org"" rel=""noreferrer"">QGIS</a>, but any half-decent GIS will do the job. Add the building layer that you downloaded. I also reprojected to RD-coordinates (EPSG 28992) and converted the layer to a point layer (in QGIS under Vector > Geometry Tools > Polygon centroids). That gives you slightly over 10 million points (10011369 to be exact). It makes the work cleaner and for our purpose the centroid of the building is more than precise enough. Under Style or something you will be able to chose the symbol that represents each point. I picked a black circle corresponding to about 1 pixel with 15% opacity. You have to play a little with the opacity. Too high and you get something like the second map. Too low and Flevoland becomes invisible. But a lower opacity would be better to get some more details in the cities or the Randstad. This is the point where you can be an artist.</p>

"How do I get the 'Paris Visite' ticket?","13815","","<p>Where can I buy the <a href=""http://www.transilien.com/static/tarifs/paris-visite"">Paris Visite</a> ticket? (I live in Brazil). Also, how do I calculate whether it is going to be cheaper than just buying single tickets?</p>
","<p>My opinion is that a Paris Visite pass is hardly worth the money. </p>

<p>If that's true in your case is difficult to answer. Basically, you have to use the public transport quite heavily. The price of single metro ticket is 1.70 EUR and if you buy tickets by a batch of 10 (""carnet""), the price goes down to 1.33 EUR per ticket. With that information in mind, take the Paris Visite pass you are interested in (1, 2,3 or 5 days), and calculate how often you would be able to take the public transport on regular tickets, ot how many <a href=""http://www.transilien.com/static/tarifs/paris-visite-avantages"">discounts</a> you would have to use.  </p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>. A 2 day pass is 15.85 EUR. For a bit less than that, 15 EUR, you can buy 11 regular tickets (1 carnet and 1 single ticket). That's a lot for two days, especially if you plan your sightseeing a bit rationally. </p>

<p>And don't let yourself fool by the discounts. Some are more sexy, some other are less sexy. Check precisely what the discounts are good for, check the prices. And check if you are interested in these at all! Plan your sightseeing first, i.e. make a list of what your are interested in and see if that's covered by the pass. Don't do it the other way round. You might miss a lot!</p>

"Understanding the reasons for a Schengen visa refusal","13813","","<p>I'm 17 years old, Sudanese, and I live in the UAE. I registered for a German course in Munich, and I got an invitation from a family friend who is German and applied for a tourist visa. It got refused; the reasons:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You have not provided proof of sufficient means of subsistence, for the duration of the intended stay or for the return to the country of origin or residence, or for the transit to a third country into which you are certain to be admitted, or you are not in a position to acquire such means lawfully.<br>
  [and]<br>
  The information submitted regarding justification for the purpose and conditions of the intended stay was not reliable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I really don't understand; what do they mean? How can I appeal this?</p>
","<p>The procedure to appeal should be explained in the refusal notification. Basically, it seems you should complain in writing, explaining why you think you do qualify for a visa. <a href=""http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/DE/Infoservice/FAQ/VisumFuerD/10-Ablehnung.html?nn=350374"" rel=""nofollow"">There is a page about that</a> (in German) on the website of the German Foreign Ministry but it's not very detailed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You have not provided proof of sufficient means of subsistence, for the duration of the intended stay or for the return to the country of origin or residence, or for the transit to a third country into which you are certain to be admitted, or you are not in a position to acquire such means lawfully.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should have a certain amount of money for each day you plan to spend in the Schengen area (even if you are staying with a friend) and also enough money to return to the UAE. You should therefore provide evidence of that (e.g. bank account statement). Having a return ticket would also satisfy the “return to the country of origin or residence”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The information submitted regarding justification for the purpose and conditions of the intended stay was not reliable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This one will be tougher to satisfy. It suggests the consular officer does not believe you are coming to Germany for a course and suspects you might try to stay illegally at the end of the stay. Perhaps they don't consider the school to be serious or do not believe your family friend can really host you. Did you submit some confirmation of your registration for the course?</p>

<p>It's a slightly different issue but showing you have reasons to come back to the UAE (say a school registration, a job, a house, a family) could also help alleviate concerns. Unfortunately, those decisions are sometimes a bit arbitrary and it's not always possible to do something about it.</p>

"Why does my phone's GPS not work in China?","13798","","<p>I am trying to use Google Maps in China. I know that Google is blocked, which is why I downloaded the map of Beijing offline. However, when I open the app my phone attempts to find GPS satellites but finds none. I know location works because my location works fine when I am on WiFi. Is this a China blocking GPS thing or something else?</p>

<p><strong>Update 1:</strong></p>

<p>All my testing for this question was done on the 7th floor of a downtown office building. Yesterday after waiting a while, I was able to recieve GPS signal (using both Google Maps and GPS Status) while on the 17th floor of a suburban apartment building. I was then also able to recieve signal in another part of downtown that lacked many tall buildings. When I get back to the office tomorrow I will be able to judge if it was just taking a mega-long time to get the satellite data as @Vince suggested, or if it is the urban canyon as @Loren suggested. Thank you all for the help and explanations!</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong></p>

<p>After some testing, it seems that this does simply come down to an urban canyon problem. The GPS does not find any satellites at my desk in the office, however, if I bring it next to a window it finds 2 satellites (not enough for a location, but enough to answer this question). When I take the phone outside the building I am able to get location in some areas. Thank you all again for the help and the wealth of new knowledge. </p>

<p>Note: all testing was done with data and WiFi services turned off.</p>

"Travelling to the US on the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) to attend a job interview","13763","","<p>I am a UK citizen who has been invited to the US for the purposes of an onsite interview in a few weeks' time. I have been looking online for an answer to this question and have found many conflicting reports (for examples of such differing opinions google terms like 'vwp job interview' and read the many answers).</p>

<p>While applying online using the ESTA form I came across this question (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>D) <strong>Are you seeking to work in the U.S.</strong>; or have you ever been excluded and deported; or been previously removed from the United States or procured or attempted to procure a visa or entry into the U.S. by fraud or misrepresentation?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no additional context to this question such as 'on this visa' and so looking at it objectively it seems that the only correct answer in my scenario is to answer 'yes' - I <strong>am</strong> seeking to work in the US, albeit in many months time if and when the company a) offers a job and b) acquires an appropriate work visa.</p>

<p>Clearly answering 'yes' to this question is the 'wrong' answer and looks very much as if it would result in a rejection. I do not wish to answer 'no' and be seen as having lied due to the above reasoning (especially if asked at the border what the intention of my trip is - the truth is that I am there to attend a specific interview and leave).</p>

<p>I'm asking here because I cannot find anywhere official that states whether this scenario counts as 'seeking to work in the U.S.' or not. I have only found several people across the web who are utterly convinced of their own reading of the phrase 'seeking to work' and their implicit assumption of non-existent context in the question.</p>

<p>The company in question now tells me I need a B-1 visa instead which I have begun the process for, however I am not convinced yet that this is required for my situation, considering my trip will be 2-3 days only. I have tried emailing the Embassy in London but it will be a few days before I potentially hear back.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: After reading links in the comments, an additional question is in regards to the difference between the B-1/B-2 and the VWP - does a B1/B2 visa offer anything regarding job interviews to the holder aside from more time in the US (which in this scenario is not an issue)? <a href=""http://travel.state.gov/pdf/BusinessVisa.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">This pdf</a> for example does not include mention of a job interview and is linked from <a href=""http://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/without/without_1990.html#overview"" rel=""noreferrer"">this VWP page</a> giving the impression that the two paths of entry are functionally the same in terms of business travel. If anyone knows of an official statement regarding the visa to use for pre-arranged job interviews then this would be extremely useful.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: I have received an email response from the London Embassy. They state:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you are travelling to the United States exclusively for an interview or meetings, you may do so on a B-1 business visitor or visa-free under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) if you are otherwise eligible. Please be aware that you are not permitted to undertake any work on a B-1 visa or the VWP and must obtain the relevant work visa in order to do so.</p>
  
  <p>At the time that you apply for entry to the United States you will be require to demonstrate that your purpose of travel is appropriate for visa-free travel or the visa you hold, and that you intend to comply fully with your conditions of entry and that you have sufficiently strong social and economic ties to your country of residence to compel you to depart the United States at the conclusion of a temporary visit.</p>
  
  <p>Immigration officials at the port of entry make the final determination of each individual’s eligibility to enter the United States.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am still looking for written confirmation about the answer to give to question D) above. It looks as if the answer is simply that the question is worded terribly and that in fact the correct answer is to say 'No' - but this is not directly confirmed yet.</p>

<p><strong>FINAL UPDATE</strong>: I successfully traveled using the ESTA (marking <strong>no</strong> for the aforementioned question) and had no problems at the border when explaining that I was visiting for a job interview. On my landing card I marked that my trip was for business purposes. I didn't even have to show any documentation other than my passport (I had printed my ESTA confirmation, hotel information, interview confirmation etc.) but obviously this may vary. Hopefully this question helps anyone in a similar situation.</p>
","<p>Speaking from first-hand experience, I can say with certainty that YES, you CAN use the VWP in order to enter the US to attend a job interview, either for a job in the US or for a job outside of the US.</p>

<p>A VWP is functionally equivalent to a B1/B2 visa (they often actually write B1 or B2 on the entry stamp to designate this!), and there are no other visas that would allow you to attend a job interview, so clearly B1/B2, and thus VWP, is the correct status.</p>

<p>That's not to say that you won't have some trouble on entry.  The fact that you are entering the country to attend a job interview will immediately put the immigration agent on alert that you are potentially entering the country to actually 'work', which is NOT allowed under a VWP. </p>

<p>As with any entry to any country, at the end of the day it is up to the immigration officials to decide if they will let you into the country - if they believe you are there to actually work, you will be denied entry, regardless of whether you have a visa or not (other than a work visa, obviously). If they believe that you are there simply for a job interview, and that you will not be paid for anything that you do in the country (other than expense reimbursement), then you will be allowed enter.</p>

<p>I would suggest carrying as much documentation as possible to show that you are not intending to stay and work on this visit. Examples of this would include a letter from your prospective employer clearing stating that you are only entering the country for a short period for the interview, that you will be returning to your home country after a few days, and that if you are successful in obtaining the job then they will proceed to support your application for a relevant work visa in the future. Also make sure that you have a printout of your return ticket, and preferably details of where you will be staying during your stay - I was asked for both of these when entering on a VWP for a job interview.</p>

<p>Also, if you are interviewing with a large, well known company be sure to say so - immigration staff know that companies like Microsoft, Google, etc, will not hire someone without checking their legal status in the country, which will help in convincing the immigration staff that you are not intending to work on this visit.</p>

<p>You have three main choices - O2, Vodafone and TMobile.  </p>

<p>It appears... that O2 might be the best option, as it <em>looks</em> like their acceptable use policy is that once you've used the small amount of data a day, the speed throttles down.

"How do unsold first-class seats get used?","13705","","<p>How do unsold first-class seats get used?</p>

<p>I assume that if first-class seats are unsold by the time of the flight, the airline has some mechanism for utilitizing them. What would that be?</p>

<p>For example, I have a flight coming up in a couple of week and I see that only 2 of 10 first class seats are currently taken. What happens to those seats if they are unsold by the day of the flight?</p>
","<p>It varies depending on the airline. First, they may not be unsold right now. Just because a seat hasn't been selected doesn't mean a ticket hasn't been bought. There are tools that can show you how many tickets have been sold in each fare class, and I have seen many times that all the business-class tickets are sold, yet only 20 or 30% of the seats are marked occupied on seat maps. (It's pretty normal for economy to be oversold, too.)</p>

<p>Second, some airlines allow their frequent fliers to upgrade into business class, using some sort of certificates or points schemes. These upgrades may happen weeks or days in advance, or at the gate when the flight is about to leave. </p>

<p>Third, some airlines allow anyone to buy a ""last minute upgrade"" - for about $100 for each hour of flight time, in my experience - when checking in online or at the gate.</p>

<p>Finally, some airlines will upgrade some passengers (chosen in theory according to status as a frequent flier, early check in, and fare class of original ticket, but at some airlines lazily chosen from among less deserving non status late checkins because it's the easiest way to handle them) for no charge. This is called an Operational Upgrade or Op Up. On a recent flight home from Seattle to Toronto I was op-upped for weight and balance reasons (small plane, needed more people at the front) which was a pleasant surprise. </p>

<p>Some US airlines are well known for never sending out an empty business-class seat, moving up as many people as they can to fill business class. Other airlines, especially those based in the Middle East, believe if they do that, their frequent fliers would never buy business class, so they'll fly out with empty seats up front rather than ""devalue"" the product by giving it away free unless they have an operational reason for doing so. My experience is that op-upping a frequent flier to free up a seat for someone who would otherwise be turned away (overbooked flight) does happen throughout the world, but that with the exception of US-based airlines, business class is quite often not full. </p>

","<p><strong>Dominican Republic's currency</strong> is the Dominican Peso, DOP.</p>

<p>It might be possible that Canadian dollars are accepted, but I suggest to use US dollars (USD), as they are widely accepted. In touristic areas (and resorts), restaurant menus and stores have their prices in USD. You can use either USD or DOP, they will be both accepted most of the time in touristic areas.</p>

<p>If you are changing currencies, most resorts have currency exchange, so you can do it inside the resort. Contact the resort you are visiting for that matter or they might already have that info on their website. I don't know about Punta Cana airport, it is possible they have an office of one of the local banks and you might be able to do the exchange there, but I don't have experience on that. 1 USD is about 43 DOP (as of may 2014. Google has a currency converter, you can check the query ""1 usd to dop"").</p>

<p><strong>About tipping</strong>, I'll quote this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Restaurant bills already include a ten percent tip. It is customary to give an additional 10% for good service. Most people do not tip taxi drivers, however if you feel so inclined for good service, a tip will certainly be appreciated.</p>

<p>Two days later, when the conference is over, I'll need to travel back to the airport as well. My flight departs at 11:45  am, so I should be to the airport no later than 10:15 am.  If there is any reason I should use a different method of transportation at this time of the day, please let me know.</p>

<p>I have done some basic research and know that the options are generally a taxi and public transportation.  I think I'd like to avoid the taxi due to traffic &amp; cost.  But there are so many options with public transportation that it's confusing. </p>

<p>I thought the NYC Airport Shuttle might be a good idea:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.nycairporter.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NYC Airporter</a></p>

<p>But then I looked up the Yelp reviews and decided against it.  One of the Yelp reviews recommended the AirTrain:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.panynj.gov/airports/ewr-to-from.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Port Authority Of New York And New Jersey</a></p>

<p>which seems like it would get me to Penn Station (which is my goal) with a train transfer.  However, the ""transfer"" part makes me hesitate a bit, I'm not sure what to expect with that.</p>

<p>So, what I'm really looking for is someone who has experience traveling in New York, with these various methods, and can speak from experience about the best mode of travel to/from the locations described at the times described.</p>

<p>I will only have my backpack, no other luggage, which I understand might influence the decision.</p>

<p>I'm asking ahead of time because I've always lived in areas of the country where traffic was minimal and we drive almost everywhere we go.  So, having to rely on public transportation is new experience for me and I'd like to have a plan in place and know what to expect.</p>
","<p>Let me expand on the ""train transfer"".  It's pretty easy.  I would say this is the best way to go, all things considered, especially because your hotel is right by Penn Station and so you don't have to navigate the NYC subway.  Buses or airport shuttles might be cheaper but are subject to traffic; taxis cost quite a bit more.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.panynj.gov/airports/ewr-airtrain.html"" rel=""nofollow"">AirTrain</a> is just an airport monorail that can take you from the airport terminal to the ""real"" Newark Airport train station (aka Newark Liberty International Airport Station).  From there you take a NJ Transit train to New York Penn Station.  You can find timetables <a href=""http://www.njtransit.com/sf/sf_servlet.srv?hdnPageAction=TrainTo"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.  (There is a popup that tells you about construction on the line, but if you look at the date it is in the past, so doesn't affect you.)  Be sure to buy your ticket from a NJ Transit ticket machine at the Newark Airport station before boarding NJ Transit.  (If I recall correctly, there are also ticket machines in the airport terminal, just before you board AirTrain.) If you forget, the conductor on the NJ Transit train will sell you a ticket, but there is a surcharge.  The fare is $12.50 (part of which goes to pay for AirTrain).  There are no assigned seats on NJ Transit, just sit in any seat you find.</p>

<p>NJ Transit runs quite frequently on weekday evenings (several trains per hour) so you should not have to wait long.  Just watch the signs on the tracks to make sure you get on a train going the correct direction, north towards Newark and New York.  I believe all of the trains from Newark Airport go directly into New York City without an additional transfer; you could confirm this with the conductor who takes your ticket.  New York Penn Station would be the end of the line.</p>

<p>Note that there is a Newark Penn Station which sounds confusingly similar to both Newark Airport and New York Penn Station, and is an intermediate stop between the two.  So don't get off there by mistake.</p>

<p>There are also some Amtrak trains that stop at Newark Airport station and also go to New York Penn Station, but they are less frequent and cost more.  Just ignore them.</p>

<p>The way back is similar, though as kdgregory says you will want to allow some extra time to find your way through New York Penn Station. Check the timetable linked above to work out which train you should take, based on when you want to be at the airport.  (Allow an extra 10-15 minutes for the AirTrain connection.) You will first need to find the NJ Transit area (the station is also served by Amtrak and the Long Island Rail Road).  Buy a ticket at a machine.  Then look for a big board listing upcoming departures.  You will want either the Northeast Corridor or New Jersey Coast line (double check the timetable I linked above).  The board will tell you which track to go to for your train.  Get off at Newark Airport station and take AirTrain to the terminal.</p>

<p>Finally, keep an eye out for employees in maroon jackets.  They are present in the Newark airport and the train stations and will answer any questions you have regarding which train to board or tickets to purchase, etc.  (Thanks Randy Syring.)</p>

"UK citizen, US company, living in UK: Can I use an ESTA?","13619","","<p>So:</p>

<ul>
<li>I am a UK citizen</li>
<li>I work for a US company</li>
<li>I currently live in the UK and have no US visa</li>
</ul>

<p>What am I allowed to do when I enter the US on an ESTA? Am I allowed to work if I am getting paid in a UK bank account? Obviously a potentially contentious issue and I'm keen to get it right!</p>
","<p>The Visa-Waiver Program, or VWP (which is what the ESTA relates to) allows you to enter the US for the purposes of Tourism or Business, but not for 'work'.</p>

<p>The distinction here is really down to where you are paid.  Presuming you are already working for this company, and being paid in the UK, then your visit to their US offices is classified as a ""business"" trip, and is thus eligible for entry under the VWP.</p>

<p>Whilst you are in the US you are able to participate in 'business' for your company, but in effect this must be the same type of business that you would have been carrying out whilst you were in the UK.  They can not pay you any additional wage (other than expenses/etc) over what you would normally have done in the UK, and they can not pay you locally in US dollars or in any form that would require you to have a US Social Security Number.</p>

<p>ie, you're good!  This is one of the purposes the VWP was designed for, and I've personally done exactly what you're describing at least a dozen times (from Australia rather than the UK, but otherwise the exact same situation)</p>

<p>The definition of what is allowed under a B-1 visa (and thus also under the VWP) is defined in the <a href=""http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/87206.pdf"">U.S. Department of State Foreign Affairs Manual Volume 9 - Visas</a></p>

<p>The relevant section is :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>9 FAM 41.31 N8 ALIENS TRAVELING TO UNITED STATES TO ENGAGE IN
  COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS, NEGOTIATIONS, CONSULTATIONS, CONFERENCES,
  ETC.</p>
  
  <p>(CT:VISA-701; 02-15-2005)</p>
  
  <p>Aliens should be classified B-1
  visitors for business, if otherwise eligible, if they are traveling to
  the United States to: </p>
  
  <p>(1) Engage in commercial transactions, which do
  not involve gainful employment in the United States (such as a
  merchant who takes orders for goods manufactured abroad);</p>
  
  <p>(2) Negotiate contracts;</p>
  
  <p>(3) Consult with business associates;</p>
  
  <p>(4) Litigate;</p>
  
  <p>(5) Participate in scientific, educational, professional, or
  business conventions, conferences, or seminars; or
  (6) Undertake independent research.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's also worth specifically reading the section in that document regarding the ""Board of Immigration Appeals in Matter of Hira"", which basically holds that partaking in work actives whilst in the US, whilst not being paid locally (other than expenses) as a part of future work that will principally be performed outside of the United States, IS covered by B-1 status.  You can find a copy of the Hina ruling on the <a href=""http://www.justice.gov/eoir/vll/intdec/vol11/1647.pdf"">Department of Justice Website.</a></p>

<p>The main confusion with B-1/VWP is the very mis-used term ""work"".  In general in immigration law, ""work"" when used in most contexts actually relates to being employed and/or remunerated (other than reasonable expenses) in that country, not the act of actually working.</p>

<p>As an example of this, the Department of Justice/INS document ""<a href=""http://www2.gtlaw.com/practices/immigration/hr/guides/PermissibleActivities.pdf"">PERMISSIBLE ACTIVITIES FOR B-1 BUSINESS VISITOR</a>"" specifically states that the ""B-1 classification applies when a foreign employer requires an alien employee to <strong>work</strong> temporarily in the United States (US) pursuant to the foreign employer’s international transactions.""  ie, it is permissible to ""work"" in the US whilst under B-1 status, but not to be ""employed"" in the US.</p>

<p>(Note that the ""foreign employer"" part of this statement will almost certainly be true, even though the person claims to work for a ""US Company"" on the grounds that the actual employer will be a local subsidiary of the US company - at least from a legal perspective)</p>

"Smoking weed in Amsterdam as a tourist","13525","","<p>I read the following question and all its answers:</p>

<p><a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/12942/is-weed-still-legal-for-tourists-in-amsterdam/12943#12943"">Is weed still legal for tourists in Amsterdam?</a></p>

<p>I am not even a weed smoker, but since I am going to Amsterdam, I thought I'd give it a try. I would just like to know <strong>how</strong> to be able to do it, since I don't quite understand if you <em>really</em> need a weed pass when going to a coffee-shop or not. I also don't understand if 3 years after the question/answer the situation has changed.</p>
","<p>What the law currently says is that ""coffee shops"" are only allowed to sell cannabis to people residing in the Netherlands (<em>ingezetenencriterium</em>) and can check that by asking a proof of registration from a Dutch municipality (together with a valid ID). This rule has replaced the ""weed pass"" concept, which has been abandoned, and is in principle valid nationwide.</p>

<p>However, it's up to the municipalities to integrate this new rule in their local ""coffee shop policy"" and coordinate with the police and the public prosecutor to enforce it. As of <a href=""https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/actueel/nieuws/2015/07/01/ingezetenencriterium-in-meer-coffeeshopgemeenten-onderdeel-van-beleid"" rel=""nofollow"">mid-2015</a>, most municipalities in the Netherlands did so and municipalities in the south (which drove the reform in the first place) seem especially aggressive in enforcing it (I saw media reports about police raids and coffee shop closures).</p>

<p>But Amsterdam most certainly did not, and various press reports suggest that it first agreed to close coffee shops that were too close to schools intead of implementing the new rule and then decided to postpone that while waiting for a court decision. The justice minister also went on record (in 2012, as the new rules were introduced) stating that the ministry would not try to enforce the residency rule in Amsterdam on its own and could not specify when it would be implemented.</p>

<p>As a practical matter, in Amsterdam, as of Spring 2016, you can buy whatever you want and smoke on the premises without any problem, no questions asked. Personally, I do not smoke and obviously cannot vouch that each and every shop will serve you but that's what I have observed and I can't imagine shops would restrict purchases unless the municipality forces them to. You can also buy weed as a tourist in The Hague (and, I think, Rotterdam and Utrecht) but they tend to be stricter with regards to other products like space cakes.</p>

<p>Thanks ahead of time for any suggestions.</p>
","<p>Travelling by cargo ship (mostly container but also bulk or ro-ro, never heard anything about travelling on a tanker, presumably for safety reasons) is totally a thing. More information and links to specific agents can be found in <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/freighter-travel"">previous questions tagged “freighter travel”</a>. Many websites advertise specific journeys but you can always contact an agent and see what they can find for you. The only US-based freighter travel agent I know is <a href=""https://www.freightercruises.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Maris Freighter Cruise</a>.</p>

<p>It's not particularly complicated but relatively slow and expensive and needs to be arranged well in advance (you will also need a certificate from your GP and special “deviation” insurance – to protect the ship's operator against losses if they need to change the ship's route because of you, e.g. in case of medical emergency). The price is not fixed nor based on distance <em>per se</em> but simply USD 90-110 per day (+insurance, agent fees and embarkation/disembarkation fees), and crossing the Pacific takes at least 20 days, so around $2,000 (this also covers food on board, you get meals at fixed times with the ship's officers, alcohol at the discretion of the captain, sometimes not at all – it's not a cruise, freight goes first and your entertainment a distant second!).</p>

<p>You could also go the other way around and cross the Atlantic (on a cargo ship, a <a href=""http://www.cunard.co.uk/cruise-search/book-a-cruise/results/?tids=TRAN"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">regular passenger line</a> or a seasonal “repositioning” cruise) and then go on to Asia by train or cargo ship.  Not quick or cheap by any means but certainly a journey to remember. If you are prepared to go for less luxurious options (<a href=""http://www.langsamreisen.de/frachtschiffreisen/europa-nord-mittelamerika/italien-usaostkueste/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cheap freighter option</a> or cheapest offer from Cunard, <em>kupe</em> on the trans-Siberian), you could probably manage it for $5,000-$7,000 I think. A friend of mine went to Japan from Europe taking buses to avoid expensive Western European trains and buying a <em>platskartny</em> ticket directly in Moscow (so one class below <em>kupe</em>, you get a bunk in a carriage with 50 other passengers); it was <em>much</em> cheaper than a pre-arranged tour, possibly even competitive with the plane, but you have to love adventure!</p>

<p>Exactly where you end up on the west coast of the Pacific Ocean is not very important. Once you have reached East Asia or the Russian Far East, the last hop to Japan is not a problem, there are many ferries.</p>

"What's with Canada's airport codes?","13432","","<p>In my flying experience (passenger), I've gotten used to seeing 3 letter airport codes.  AKL = Auckland. LHR = London Heathrow.  LGW = London Gatwick. LAX = Los Angeles.  <em>Generally</em>, they seem to make sense - some sort of logic flow is applied to the name.</p>

<p>Which brings me to Canada.  What bemuses me is when I see Canadian airports - they (so far) all seem to start with Y.  YVR = Vancouver. YYZ = Toronto.  YEG = Edmonton.  And so on.  VR is sort of an abbreviation for Vancouver, I guess, and Edmonton at least <em>starts</em> with an E, but I can't explain the Toronto one.  And where the Y comes from I have no idea.  Can anyone explain why they start with a Y, historically?</p>
","<p>The short answer is that by regulation, the three-character IATA code for an airport in Canada generally corresponds to a three-character Transport Canada code (TCLID), which in turn generally corresponds to the last three letters of its four-character ICAO airport code. So why do the ICAO codes for Canadian airports all start with CY or CZ? That is murkier.</p>

<p>When the process of assigning international airport codes began during World War II, it integrated many existing identifiers set up by airlines, weather stations, radio navigation beacons, railway terminal telegraph stations, and so on. According to a quotation in an <a href=""http://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums/general_aviation/read.main/2857478/"">Airliners.net thread</a> (take it for what you will, but it was the closest thing to a real citation I could find), Canada's were based on existing weather service codes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Canada used two letters for identification of a weather reporting station. Additionally, preceding the 2-letter code, was placed a Y (meaning ""yes"") where the reporting station was co-located with an airport, a W (meaning ""without"") where the reporting station was not co-located with an airport, and a U where the reporting station was co-located with an NDB. An X was used if the last two letters of the code had already been taken by another Canadian ident, and a Z was used if the locator could be confused with a U.S. three letter ident. (section 2.18 pg 64)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have also seen the theory advanced that the codes derive from radio transmitter identifers: ITU assigns the prefixes CF-CK, CY, and CZ to Canada, of which CY and CZ are reserved for transportation. CYYZ was the beacon at Malton, Ontario where Toronto Pearson International Airport is now located. On the other hand, airports like YQX and YYT have Canadian codes even though their corresponding radio callsigns would have had VA-VG or VO prefixes, the codes assigned for Newfoundland, which did not join Canada until 1949. It's possible that being closely tied to Canada, they used Canadian codes, or that they adopted new codes after confederation. It's also possible that some airports were designated after weather stations and others from radio transmitters, and that at least some transmitter codes are based on weather station codes in turn.</p>

","<p>From <a href=""http://wikitravel.org/en/Serbia"">Wikitravel</a>:</p>

<p>Language: Serbian 90.1% (official), Hungarian 3.8%, Romany (Gypsy) 1.1%, other 4.1%, unknown 0.9% (2002 census) </p>

<p>So in that respect, Hungarian is the next best bet.  However, that's 'official' languages and was a 2002 Census - if you keep on top of world affairs, things have changed a lot in that area since then.</p>

<p>So reading further down the same page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Serbs are warm people, especially towards tourists. They are very
  welcoming towards tourists, of which there are not many as the
  country's full potential has yet to be reached! Most Serbs speak some
  English and are eager to speak it (seniors, however, are more likely
  to speak German and/or French), so you will be able to find your way
  around by asking directions. Most tourists come to Serbia in the
  summer and you can often hear German, Italian, French and English in
  the streets of Belgrade, while Slovenian tourists pour for New Year
  holidays.</p>

<p>So based on that - English is a pretty good bet, if you speak that (which it seems you do) - ask the young people questions for a better success rate.  If you speak German or French, I'd be asking older people for directions etc.</p>

"Is it possible to buy the ticket on board in German train?","13378","","<p>I was wondering if it's possible to buy the ticket on board. I have to get a train at the airport and even if everything goes very well it will be tight. 
Can I buy it on board from the supervisor (or any other method)?</p>
","<h2>Short Answer</h2>

<p><strong>Yes!</strong> Typically you will find a ticket conductor on-board who will check tickets in the start. Try to contact him beforehand in order to ensure risk free travel. The ticket conductor can help you purchase a ticket on-board the train. The ticket will be a little bit more expensive, but it is certainly possible.</p>

<p>This is clearly mentioned on the <a href=""http://www.bahn.de/p_en/view/booking/tickets-and-seats/how-to-buy-a-ticket.shtml"">Deutsche Bahn website</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you're really in a hurry, you can buy your ticket on Deutsche
  Bahn's trains. These tickets cost slightly more than conventional
  tickets bought before departure, but you can pay either in cash or by
  credit card. Certain special offers are not available on trains. NB:
  if buying a ticket worth over EUR 50, you are required to present
  either your passport, national ID, or your BahnCard. One final tip: if
  travelling by local train or suburban rail services (S-Bahn), you need
  to buy your ticket before boarding your train.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As Deutsche Bahn mentions, make sure the train you are trying to board is not a local train (you will have to pay a penalty fare if you are found in these without a ticket, costing double the ticket price or at least 40 EUR). <strong>The local trains include Interregio-Express, Regional-Express, Regionalbahn, S-Bahn.</strong></p>

<p>For the <strong>IC, ICE, ICN</strong> this would be completely valid and applicable and is a great lifesaver!</p>

<hr>

<h2>Trains with Reservations</h2>

<p>Some trains mandate reservations, such as the ICE-Sprinter or the <a href=""http://www.bahn.com/i/view/GBR/en/prices/europe/overnight-travel.shtml"">City Night Line</a>. You <em>must</em> ask the ticket conductor for permission and ensure that there are empty seats on the train <em>before</em> getting comfortable in the train. Typically it's easy to check if a seat has been reserved for someone. The reservation detail is shown by a display on top of the seat. All trains however do not offer this feature.</p>

<p>This means that you cannot go and grab a seat and wait for the train to start moving before you purchase the ticket from the ticket conductor.</p>

<p>If empty seats are available on such a train and you are able to purchase a ticket (along with a reservation), the ticket conductor will allow you to travel on the train. If you are found on a train which has mandatory reservation and has no empty seats, you will be asked to de-board on the next station.</p>

<p>An ICE-Sprinter (or CNL) is never absolutely necessary in order to reach from Point A to Point B, but just in case you do take one of these trains, you want to avoid unnecessary problems.</p>

<hr>

<h2>DB is not the only operator in Germany</h2>

<p>You must also take note that a significant portion of stock operated in Germany is not <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_German_railway_companies"">operated</a> by Deutsche Bahn (information provided by @Tor-EinarJarnbjo).

South O.C. is a long way from LAX, however, and you may be forced to wait while they fill the van and while they drop off everyone else. Best case scenario with no traffic, you arrive in Irvine in an hour, but it can easily be triple that. The two <a href=""http://www.lawa.org/welcome_lax.aspx?id=1298"" rel=""nofollow"">shared ride van</a> concessions are currently SuperShuttle and PrimeTime, and there is also <a href=""http://www.mickeysairportbus.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Mickey's Airport Bus</a> if you reserve in advance.</p>

<p>It is a pretty straight shot down the 405, but getting a one-way car rental from LAX to SNA can vary considerably in price. I just tried it now and was quoted $96, and after adding fuel and insurance it would be more convenient simply to take a taxi, which <a href=""http://www.taxifarefinder.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Taxi Fare Finder</a> estimates at $150.</p>

<p>There are other combinations of buses and trains that are possible, but these will take considerably longer and require multiple transfers. My favorite way to get from LAX-SNA was by Embraer 120; sadly, Skywest (dba United Express) discontinued those flights years ago.</p>

"What is the correct way to pay in a restaurant when you get the check in a book?","13280","","<p>In German restaurants (at least the less fancy ones) the waiter usually brings you the check and immediately collects the money.</p>

<p>In other European countries (e.g. France, Italy, Belgium), the waiter brings you the check and leaves.</p>

<p>I've always managed to pay my bill in some way, but never understood what the intended follow-up is. </p>

<p>Suppose you want to pay in cash (otherwise it's simple) and you don't need any change:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Do you lay the money on the table and leave? Or do you lay the money on the table and wait?</p></li>
<li><p>If (as common) the check is in a book, do you place the money on or in the book?</p></li>
<li><p>If the answer to 1. is ""wait"" and the answer to 2. is ""in"", the waiter can't see if you've put the cash in. Does he come back after some time or does he wait for a signal?</p></li>
</ol>
","<p>I think the most standard scenario is visibly leaving the money (or a credit card) in the book/cup/whatever. Make sure banknotes cannot fly away and wait. The waiter will expect you to do that and try to check again shortly. Just laying the cash and leaving is not the end of the world but it's clearly not the usual way, at least in France. If they are too busy and you really want to leave, you can also walk up to the counter/desk/whatever but that would also be somewhat unusual. Whatever you do, waiters will try to accommodate you but people standing up before they have paid does create some stress.</p>

<p>Note that in France for example, a tip is not really expected (when I worked as a waiter I was happy to get one of course but at least half of the tables don't give any and that's perfectly OK). The way most people tip is by getting their change and then leaving some (or perhaps even more than that) on the table when leaving. Saying “make 15” (say on a EUR 20 banknote for a EUR 13 bill) is something Germans do ;-)</p>

<p>I don't know precisely about Italy or Belgium but I think that in the Netherlands there is a stronger expectation that you stand up and go to the desk to pay, at least if the place is not too fancy.</p>

"What is a polite way to tell a Scottish person that I am struggling to understand his/her accent?","13278","","<p>I am flying to Glasgow tomorrow. English isn't my mother tongue. In spite of living in London for the last 10 years, I still struggle with understanding different accents.</p>

<p>My main concern about the time I'll spend in Glasgow is that I won't be able to communicate well, simply because I can't understand what they say.</p>

<p>What is a polite way to inform all the people I deal with there that I can't understand what he/she says and it's my fault, NOT his/hers?</p>
","<p>I'm English and lived in Glasgow for 4 years. Understanding many (but certainly not all) people <em>will</em> be tricky (even us native speakers struggle), but they'll be very willing to try to help you understand, and it won't cause offence. </p>

<p>You probably won't even need to explain: as soon as they see look of blank incomprehension and hear you begin to say ""Err, sorry"" in a non-Scottish accent they'll usually laugh and know what's going on. It's a common situation. A few things to understand about Glasgow:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>They're used to it</strong>. It's a running joke in the UK that the <a href=""https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Weegie"">Weegie</a> accent is especially hard to understand. I certainly struggled more than once, and I'm a native English speaker. Everyone in Glasgow is familiar with this. Heck, plenty of people from Edinburgh struggle to understand Glaswegians (to the delight of many Glaswegians, who take it as proof that their Edinburgh rivals are less truly Scottish...). <a href=""http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13272997.The_Weegie_Words__you_help_us_list_100_words_that_prove_you_come_from_Glasgow/"">It's a very familiar situation</a>.</li>
<li><strong>It's actually somewhat exaggerated</strong> - <em>most</em> Glaswegians are very easy to understand. So much so that <a href=""http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/is-scotland-turning-into-a-call-centre-nation-1-725825"">Scotland generally and Glasgow in particular is a popular place for companies to house call centres</a> - it's a very expressive accent, and studies find people respond well to it, it sounds honest and warm. But when an individual Glaswegian <em>is</em> difficult to understand, and many are, they're <em>very</em> difficult to understand - and you <em>will</em> encounter several such people. It won't be everyone you meet, or even the majority, just a very memorable, sizeable minority.</li>
<li><strong>They take pride in being helpful to foreign guests</strong>. Glaswegians take a lot of pride in being welcoming to outsiders (especially non-English outsiders... <code>:-)</code> but surprisingly welcoming to us <a href=""http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/ScotLit/ASLS/SWE/TBI/TBIIssue13/Sassenach.html"">sassenachs</a> too), and particularly to Scandinavians (many pro-independence Glaswegians feel more affinity to social-democratic Scandinavia than they do to the London-dominated, more conservative UK). The <a href=""http://refuweegee.co.uk/"">Refuweegee project</a> is a topical textbook example of Weegie pride in being warmly welcoming to foreigners. Most Glaswegians will be very happy to try to help you out.</li>
<li><strong>They're very aware of the difference between their speech and standard English, and tend to be rather proud of it.</strong> The idea that <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scots_language"">Scots dialect</a> is not a dialect but a wholly separate language to English is pretty popular in pro-independence Glasgow, and there's even a term for and books about <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_patter"">Glasgow's unique ""patter""</a>. Scots spell differently when writing in Scots as opposed to formal English, there are even <a href=""http://www.whoohoo.co.uk/scottish-translator.asp"">online translators</a>.    Glaswegians take a lot of pride in having a good sense of humour and being able to take some stick, and also in being a bit different to everywhere else. Something like this won't cause offence.</li>
<li><strong>They may have had the same experience themselves</strong>. Not only are Glaswegians familiar with others struggling to understand their accents, they're also familiar with struggling to understand other, even stronger Scottish accents themselves. For example, there's the potentially-offensive Scots word <a href=""http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Teuchter"">Teuchter</a> (pronounced like Choo-chter, with the second <code>ch</code> like Loch), which a Glaswegian friend cheerfully translated to me as meaning ""Those <a href=""http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/bampot"">bampots</a> from up North who we cannae understand what they're saying""; before doing an impression of a Teuchter accent (north highland Scottish) which, to me, was actually slightly easier to understand than her normal speech... Scottish accents are very varied, and it's not uncommon for Scots to have experienced struggling to understand other Scots.</li>
</ul>

<p>While getting people to try to help you understand will be easy, getting them to <em>succeed in</em> helping you understand them is a different story... Luckily, if all else fails, Glaswegians tend to be very expressive with their body language <code>:-)</code>.</p>

<p>You're very unlikely to cause offence (unless you accidentally get your country names mixed up and talk as if Scotland is a part of England, or imply that you think Edinburgh is in any way Scotland's most important city... those common tourist mistakes <em>will</em> cause offence!)</p>

<hr>

<p>One thing to be aware of is, Glaswegians tend to be <em>much</em> more direct and expressive than Londoners. Don't panic if a Glaswegian says something which seems blunt or confrontational to a point where a Londoner would only ever say it to a mortal enemy - it's usually just friendly banter intended in good humour. If they're actually being angry or aggressive, you'll know.</p>

<hr>

<p>Update - Mast posted a comment above suggesting practicing with a native to get used to the accent. If that's hard to do, there are several famous Glaswegian comedians who have medium-strength Glaswegian accents. Look for videos of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Kevin Bridges</li>
<li>Billy Connolly &nbsp;</li>
<li>Frankie Boyle (warning - not for the easily offended)</li>
<li>(fictional character) Rab C Nesbitt (also possibly not for the easily offended) </li>

"Can I fly domestically in the US using my university ID?","13257","","<p>Okay, so I'm an international Student here in the US. and My passport is being renewed right now. And I have to fly to Seattle in a week. So I was wondering if my university ID will suffice for a Photo ID at the airport?</p>

<p>EDIT: Or is an expired passport, but with a Valid US visa, acceptable?</p>
","<p>The TSA has a page on ""<a href=""http://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/acceptable-ids"">Acceptable ID</a>"" for passing through a security checkpoint.</p>

<p>The most important part on this page for you is :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Not having an ID, does not necessarily mean a passenger won't be
  allowed to fly. If passengers are willing to provide additional
  information, we have other means of substantiating someone's identity,
  like using publicly available databases.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whilst it's likely that a University photo ID would not be sufficient (unless it was issued in a way to meet ""REAL ID"" requirements), your US Visa, especially when combined with an expired passport, would certainly be sufficient to prove your identity.  If required, they could even carry out additional checks such as fingerprints to confirm your identity (as these would have been taken when your visa was issued), although realistically I can not see this happening.</p>

<p>I would plan to arrive at the airport a little earlier than required in case the additional checks take extra time, but I would not expect you to have any problems getting through.</p>

<p>Personally I've also been able to go through TSA checkpoints on two occasions using an Australian drivers license. I didn't intend to, but grabbed the wrong license from my wallet - and both times they commented on it and then let me through without any further checks.  I certainly wouldn't rely on that working (especially if your home-country license doesn't include security features like holograms/etc), but it's worked for me...</p>

<p>That question is too general - lacking specifics for this terminal.</p>

<p>We are asking specifically for this airport: which method to go (walk, bus, monorail) and which security we need to pass.</p>
","<p>When you fly into the US from another country and have a connecting flight, regardless of the airport, you have to (1) pass through Immigration, (2) collect luggage, clear customs, and drop off luggage, and (3) go through security in the departure terminal.</p>

<p>I have flown through Newark many times and I am quite certain the fastest way to get from terminal B to C (and only way I have ever done it) is to take the monorail.

What are the topics I should not talk about?</p>
","<p>Here's a complete list of instructions attached to the ""appointment confirmation"" document:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  
  <p>Welcome</p>
  
  <p>We look forward to seeing you at the U.S. Embassy/Consulate. For your safety and convenience, we ask that you arrive at the time of your appointment, <strong>and not earlier</strong>. We don’t want you to have to wait on the street, particularly during periods of harsh weather. </p>
  
  <p>As a reminder, you will need to bring the following required documents: </p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>A printed copy of your appointment letter</li>
  <li>Your DS-160 confirmation page,</li>
  <li>One recent photograph,</li>
  <li>Your current passport and all old passports,  </li>
  <li>Additional documents depending on the visa category</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Security Screening</h2>
  
  <p>As you prepare for your visit to the U.S. Embassy/Consulate, there are a few things you can do to help speed your entry. The safety and comfort of our guests and employees is something we take very seriously, so all visa applicants and American Citizen Services (ACS) customers must go through security screening before entering the Consular Section. To help avoid unnecessary delays for yourself and others, there are a few things which you should not bring:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>Large shoulder bags/purses – bigger than the size of an A-4 format page and zip folders. Applicants may bring one plastic bag or folder with application related documents or a small purse or handbag. Immigrant visa applicants may bring their visa application materials and the sealed envelope with the results of their medical examination.</p></li>
  <li><p>Luggage, such as suitcases, backpacks, briefcases, and other travel bags. These items cannot be brought to the Embassy/Consulate and cannot be left outside the Embassy/Consulate on the sidewalk or with individuals waiting outside. You may wish to leave your luggage in your hotel room or a train station locker.</p></li>
  <li><p>Battery-operated or electronic devices such as cameras, laptops, recording devices or portable music players. </p></li>
  <li><p>Food and drink. </p></li>
  <li><p>Sealed envelopes or packages, except for sealed envelopes containing    medical exam results. </p></li>
  <li><p>Cigarettes, cigars, match boxes, lighters.</p></li>
  <li><p>Sharp objects such as scissors, pen knives or nail files.</p></li>
  <li><p>Weapons or explosive materials of any kind.</p></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Cellular telephones must be left with Embassy/Consulate security personnel. </p>
  
  <p>This list is not exhaustive. Other items may be prohibited at the discretion of security staff.</p>
  
  <p>There is no facility at the Embassy/Consulate to store prohibited items (aside from cellular telephones). You will need to make arrangements to store these items elsewhere before entering.</p>
  
  <p>Only American Citizens seeking ACS services or visa applicants and ACS customers with a confirmed appointment will be admitted to the Consular Section.</p>
  
  <p>Unfortunately, there is no parking available at the Embassy/Consulate and cars cannot stop or stand on the street in front of the building. Visa applicants and ACS customers arriving by car should park in one of the paid public parking spots near the Embassy/Consulate or arrange to be dropped off down the street. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Once again, to provide you with better and faster service, we ask that you arrive at the time of your interview and not before.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Judging by the document itself, you can easily tell that the security procedures are going to be <strong>annoying</strong>. Below I'll describe how the procedure looked like in my case - an interview in Warsaw. Please excuse the verbosity and feel invited to write a ""TL;DR"" section:</p>

<p>Since I didn't know anything what would happen if I happened to try to bring in one of the forbidden items, I decided to wear informal clothes and carry only absolutely necessary items before going through the security check.. When I reached the U.S. Consular Office, I could see about a dozen people waiting outside the office. I was 15 minutes earlier, but one woman from the crowd told me that she's just waiting to be let in because she had to turn off her mobile phone and that I'll probably be allowed earlier. While waiting, I could see a big sign next to the door. It said that it is strictly forbidden to bring any mobile phones, weapons and some other objects that I can't remember anymore. I felt worried, because the instructions said that I would be allowed to leave it at the security check. On the other hand, another sign on the door said that it's allowed to deposit <strong>turned off</strong> mobile phones.</p>

<p>A rather impolite man let in people one-by-one and when it was finally my turn, made sure that the phone is switched off by pressing a key, then took it and gave me a token. Then I went through the metal detector, the procedure reminded the one in the airports. A woman before me had some metal detected in her small bag and had it manually inspected, so if you plan to bring one, try to bring as few private things as possible. On the other hand, it was definitely bigger than an A4 sheet, so it looks like they aren't extremely strict when enforcing the instructions.</p>

<p>I was let in and after walking through a rather lengthy empty corridor (probably another security measure) and walking down the stairs, I entered the registration counter. My passport and some other document (either DS-160 confirmation page or appointment letter, can't remember exactly) were taken by a woman at the counter, which asked me for a photo because the one I uploaded while filling out the DS-160 document did not meet the standards - a bit of top of the head was not visible. I was then asked to leave, visit any local photograph and come back with a US visa photo. This made me realize that apparently they aren't that strict about the meeting times either.</p>

<p>One of the photographer stores was already closed, but the other one (still rather close to the U.S. Consular) was close as well and also offered instant photos. I had to pay 30 PLN for a one-off set of photos out of which one was then used at the registration counter, scanned and returned to me. Then, I was allowed to go through the next step of registration. At another counter, I had my fingerprints scanned (which, as <strong>vartec</strong> said, was indeed annoying because the scanner was really picky). After that, I was supposed to take a queue token and wait in the waiting room. It was rather comfortable, with access to a fountain sink (and of course a toilet nearby). Some videos about the US army were being played on both of the screens there. According to my token number, in about 15 minutes, 19 people were interviewed at one of the few interview counters there.</p>

<p>I think that my interview took much less than five minutes. I was asked about the information I entered in my DS-160 application - when do I expect to graduate, why do I plan to visit USA, do I have any documents about the conference I plan to attend (I didn't). Visa advisers warned me that I might be asked for additional documents since I was applying for a business+tourist visa, but actually, I didn't even need to show the invitation letter from my friend. There was also a question about whether I will be there alone and a question about my Krav Maga training that I mentioned in DS-160 (they wanted to know if I was being trained by an Israelite). The interview happens at the counter, in a standing position. The interviewer spoke with an American accent. After those questions, I was informed that I got accepted and I will be notified when the passport is ready for collection in the destination I chose during the online registration process. (here's another tip: check where that is! In my case, the location was very far away from the city centre and I would be better off if I didn't decide to save on the delivery)</p>

<h2>A FINAL NOTE</h2>

<p>This describes the process in Warsaw as it happened in my case, on May 6, 2014. It might look differently depending on how much time passed since me writing this answer, the particular U.S. Consular office and - of course - your case-specific issues. As <strong>dbkk</strong> said in <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/26095/how-to-behave-on-a-us-visa-interview/26875#comment44735_26096"">his comment</a> to <strong>vartec</strong>'s answer, this might even differ <strong><em>A LOT</em></strong>.</p>

"Where is the safest place in a train?","13135","","<p>This morning I had to make a small (2-3 hours) train journey with a friend. He is a little anxious and unreasonable, and doesn't trust public transport. He won't fly at all and normally, he doesn't take the train, because he says it is too dangerous. Normally, he only trusts himself when he is the driver of his car. But today it was necessary to take the train.</p>

<p>During the journey, we had a discussion about the safest place in a train. I'm convinced that the safest places are in the back of the train, since normally, if a train has an accident, it either hits something head-on or the engine derails. So I assume that the impact is lower in the back of the train.</p>

<p>My friend argues that the places at the front of the train are safer. He has various reasons for that: </p>

<li>In case of emergency it is more probable that the electronic is working in front of the train. Therefore it is easier to open doors and get out of the train. He compares that with seats on a place directly around a emergency exit. </li>
<li>The driver of a vehicle always protects his side unconsciously. I can follow this argument in case of a car, but how should it work in a train? </li>
<li>Cars at the end of a train have a higher chance to derail.</li>
</ol>

<p>So I'm not sure who is right. Are there any statistics about safest places in a train? I know that such things exists for planes, but how is it in trains? I would really like to persuade my friend, so that we can travel more together by train.</p>
","<p>I believe that the back of the train is the safest part as well. Probably not the last carriage as it is also susceptible to crashes from the rear, although not as common as head-on collisions.</p>

<p>Having that in mind, one could say that the safest part is, in fact, the middle but in a case of locomotive (collision with) derailment (which is more common than the derailment of other train parts), the middle is exposed and vulnerable to an additional crash provided that another train (although unlikely) crashes into this already derailed one.</p>

<p>I agree with Ankur that there is back-up power that is used for opening the doors in case of the accident. But it's usually the crash that is the most dangerous moment and not the inability to get out. On older trains (non-AC usually), the doors are mechanical so there's no need for electricity whatsoever when you try to open them; you just pull the red lever and the mechanism releases the doors (if they're still functional, of course).</p>

<p>The last carriage is definitely safer shock-wise as there are not that many crashes where one train would back into another train. The other scenario is that ""your"" train is halted and another trains hits it from the back but I don't know of many accidents that played out this way. You should notice that sometimes there is a locomotive after the last carriage as well so you wouldn't know the direction of the train for the most of the journey if you don't know the route.</p>

<p>To sum up, the safest part would be two thirds or three fourths from the front end of the train if the train is moving forwards. Also, I'm sure that it is generally safer to have rear-facing seat than the front-facing one.</p>

<p>Although it's not answering your question, check out <a href=""http://www.mcaleerlaw.com/CM/TrainMARTAAccidents/Train-Accident-Statistics.asp"">McAleer Law's website about train accident statistics</a>, it's quite interesting.</p>

"Getting a foreign prescription for a prescription drug filled in the US","13049","","<p>My wife takes a prescription medication that cannot be stopped. Her supply is running out while in the US and we've tried faxing her foreign doctor's prescription to Walmart but they wouldn't accept it. What options do we have for getting a prescription quickly? We've thought of going to a walk-in clinic or urgent care but fear a lengthy diagnosis with costly lab tests.</p>
","<p>First, <strong>it is unlikely that you will find any US pharmacy that is willing fill a foreign prescription</strong>. I would not count on it. (Apparently this depends on state rules, so you might want to google ""[state] pharmacy fill foreign prescription"" or try asking your nearest consulate if they know any.)</p>

<p>From the <a href=""http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm484154.htm"">US Food and Drug Acency (FDA)</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Q:</strong> Can a foreign traveler get a prescription filled when visiting the U.S.?<br>
  <strong>A:</strong> If you’re traveling to the United States from another country and need a prescription filled, you should visit a health care provider. Very few pharmacies can fill a foreign prescription, and this is determined on a state-by-state basis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Further unofficial sources that match with your experiences:</p>

<ul>
<li>Source 1: <a href=""http://www.immihelp.com/newcomer/pharmacy.html"">Immihelp</a> </li>
<li><p>Source 2: <a href=""http://community.babycenter.com/post/a22130273/filling_foreign_prescriptions_in_the_states"">Forum Post</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'm a pharmacist. I can tell you that no pharmacy will fill a foreign prescription in the US, controlled substance or not. It's a legal issue, foreign prescriptions are not recognized in the US. All prescriptions has to be on official prescription forms now with sequence number. </p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p>Second, you could consider <strong>have someone at home ship your medication to you in the US, accompanied by a letter from your doctor</strong>. From <a href=""https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/777/~/traveling-or-living-temporarily-in-the-u.s.-and-need-to-have-my-prescription"">the CBP website (links removed by me)</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>I am traveling or living temporarily in the U.S. and I need to have my prescription medicine sent to me. What should I do?</strong></p>
  
  <p>As a general rule, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not allow prescription medications to be mailed to the U.S. However, if you are here temporarily and need to be sent your prescription medication, there are a couple of things you should do. Ask your physician to write a letter explaining that you are under their care, and that they have prescribed the drugs for your use. The letter should also explain the circumstances for sending the drugs to you, including that you are a citizen of (whatever) country, that you are temporarily in the U.S. (for travel, study, etc.) and have either run out of your medications, lost them, etc. The letter should accompany the package and be addressed to a CBP Officer or broker.</p>
  
  <p>We strongly recommend that it be in English. If the medicine is sent through the mail, it could be informally detained by CBP until an FDA Inspector is available to examine it. This can take as long as a month. It is very important that the outside package be marked with a statement that the package contains a physician's letter so that the CBP Officer will be more proactive in bringing it to the FDA's attention. A better option is to send the package by a courier service. Ask the courier service how best to flag the package so that their U.S. Customs broker will be able to tell the FDA about the special circumstances for sending the package. For more information please email the FDA Import/Export Team at cderimportexport@fda.hhs.gov.  See the FDA Regulatory Procedures Manual for Importations for more information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally <strong>if none of that works, get a prescription in the US. Contact your travel health insurance provider (and maybe also your health insurance provider at home) for where to go.</strong> I imagine that bringing results from tests done at home, diagnosis and other relevant documents might greatly facilitate the process and save you from added costs. The American health system is infamously expensive and I would go as far as getting an estimate for this last step and compare it to the price of airfare to your home country to stock up on the medication there and bringing it personally to the US. </p>

"With car rental should I pay now or pay later?","13043","","<p>I'm just checking some car rental options for May and June in California. Avis for example offers the pay now and the pay later option. When you chose pay now, you have to pay the full amount while booking it and when you chose to pay later, you have to pay when picking up the car.</p>

<p>Normally, the pay now price is significantly lower, because you take the risk on your side. However, I now see that the pay now prices are significantly higher than the pay later prices. Is there any drawback I don't know?</p>

<p>The gist of the story is basically that car rental companies are getting at least some money from their fleet even if you cancel or don't show up.  From what I just gathered on Avis the cancellation fees are $25.00 if you do it more then 6 hours before or $100 if you are a No Show or doing it less then 6 hours before the pick-up time.</p>

<p>The article also mentions that there are potential discounts that you could be missing out on once you prepay.</p>

"What is the hotel room card slot inside the room for?","13030","","<p>Several hotels I've stayed in lately (in the Middle East if that matters) have a card slot just inside the door of the room, and it appears that the lights/AC in the room only work if you have one of your room cards placed in the slot, and will turn off about 15 minutes after you take it out. The hotel staff has referred to it as the ""security card"" but assumed I knew what that meant. What is the purpose of this slot? Is it just an energy-saving feature to make sure the electric shuts off when no one is in the room?</p>

<p>Stranger still is that the housekeeping staff insists I take the card with me when I leave (though I've got the standard 2 cards for my room so I have another one anyways). Also in one of the hotels the room lights (not the bathroom) would <em>only</em> work for about 15 minutes after inserting the card, so I'd have to continually re-seat it to see anything. Thank god I was only there for one night.</p>

<p>What is this key card slot and what is its purpose?</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> For the record, in the hotel I mentioned first it seems to only have controlled the lights. The new hotel that I'm in, it controls lights and plugs (unfortunately) and they specifically only gave me one keycard, though they had no problem giving me a second card to keep the plugs running while I'm gone. I always turn out the lights anyways, so it's not wasting power that I don't want to use to begin with.</p>
","<p>This feature is becoming increasingly common in many establishments. In my opinion the purpose of such card-activated time switches is to reduce costs: the removal of the card ensures that some/all electronic appliances are turned off when the guest leaves the room, thus saving money to the hotel. Indeed guests are often given one card to access the room which is also to be used in the slot you mention to turn on the lights and air conditioning. That same card they'll have to take with them upon leaving the room, or else they won't be able to get back in. <a href=""http://www.gizmag.com/self-powered-eco-switch-for-hotel-rooms/9106/"" rel=""nofollow"">Some card-switch makers claim a 40% reduction in electricity costs for hotels using their products.</a> </p>

<p>It is worthy to note that some appliances are plugged in sockets that aren't controlled by the card switch. This is often the case for the minibar/fridge, and sometimes for the air conditioning system too. </p>

<p>The case you mention of the lights turning off every 15 minutes is something I've never experienced, and sounds very much like if the switch was broken. Personally I would have contacted hotel management and asked for another room. </p>

"Are tennis rackets allowed in airplane cabins in the US?","13029","","<p>I have a friend coming over this Christmas who wanted to bring along his tennis racket. Though the recreation center at my university is probably going to be closed, the access to the tennis courts stays unrestricted given a proper id and I am looking forward to a few good games.</p>

<p>Since my friend doesn't want to check-in any baggage, I was hoping that he would be able to carry a tennis racket in the on-board luggage. I called TSA this morning and they said it is fine. I was looking for a published rule he can point to if there's an issue. Then I found this: <a href=""https://www.tsa.gov/sites/default/files/assets/prohibiteditems_brochure.pdf"">https://www.tsa.gov/sites/default/files/assets/prohibiteditems_brochure.pdf</a>. The brochure quite explicitly says that tennis rackets are fine on-board.</p>

<p>However, there's this <a href=""http://blog.tsa.gov/2012/03/spring-forward-spring-break-travel-tips.html"">blog post</a> which clubs tennis rackets together with golf clubs, baseball bats, spears, bows and arrows and likes. So the score is 2 against 1.</p>

<p>In such a case which reference should be looked at as the ultimate authority? And what is the best way to invoke such an authority when the belts are out and the shoes are off?</p>
","<p>It seems that the blog entry you linked is outdated (2012), as a newer similar <a href=""http://blog.tsa.gov/2013_08_13_archive.html"">blog entry</a> simply does not list the tennis rackets as a prohibited item onboard while it does list the other items. <a href=""http://www.tsa.gov/sites/default/files/assets/prohibiteditems_brochure.pdf"">The TSA brochure</a> has the most recent policies, which clearly allows it. </p>

<p>Anyway, here is a list of some of the airlines policies regarding tennis racquets, they would have not allowed them if they were not allowed by TSA:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Delta:</strong> Allowed, check <a href=""http://www.delta.com/content/www/en_US/traveling-with-us/baggage/before-your-trip/special-items.html"">Special Items Page</a>, under ""Fragile, Bulky &amp; Other Items"".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>United:</strong> Allowed (one item only), check the ""Tennis"" section in the <a href=""http://www.united.com/web/en-US/content/travel/baggage/sports.aspx"">Sports equipment page</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>JetBlue:</strong>: Allowed (counted as a carry-on piece), check the <a href=""http://help.jetblue.com/SRVS/CGI-BIN/webisapi.dll/,/?St=310,E=0000000000055963381,K=198,Sxi=5,Case=obj(2236)#s18"">Sporting equipment page</a>.  </p></li>

</ul>

<p>Bear in mind that most (if not all) airlines will count it as a carry-on baggage, so if your carry-on allowance is one piece, then the racquet will use that, you will need to pay some $ if you are carrying a bag with you along with it.</p>

"What happens if I miss my Eurostar because of a delay in a domestic train to get to it?","13019","","<p>Let's say I have a non-refundable, non-changeable Eurostar ticket (i.e. the cheapest kind!). I plan a trip by train to get me from my starting point to the Eurostar terminal (eg Oxford -> London Paddington, then tube London Paddington -> London St Pancras). I plan my trip so that I'll get to the Eurostar checkin <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/13164/how-early-do-you-need-to-get-to-the-station-for-a-eurostar-service"">in enough time</a>.</p>

<p>What happens if my train to meet the Eurostar is delayed? And does it depend on what kind of ticket I bought to get to the Eurostar, and whether or not my travel to the Eurostar was on another RailTeam service or not?</p>
","<p>It does depend what ticket you have, and who you're with.</p>

<p>If you are delayed on another RailTeam service, the <a href=""http://www.railteam.co.uk/for-your-journey/railteam-services/"">‘Hop on the next available train’ (HOTNAT)</a> feature means that you may not even need to rebook (depends on the station), but if you do it'll be easy. (Keep the ticket from the delayed service though!)</p>

<p>If you bought a domestic ticket that included <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIV_%28rail_travel%29"">CIV protections</a>, eg <a href=""http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations_destinations/travel/travel_europe.html"">a ticket to London International (CIV)</a> or <a href=""http://www.seat61.com/UKconnections.htm#.UQpUk5Fxl8k"">similar</a>, when you get to the Eurostar station you need to queue up at the ticket office, show them the ticket for the delayed service, and they'll re-issue you with a new ticket for the next available Eurostar. If the delay means you missed the last train of the night, they'll have to sort you out with accommodation too.</p>

<p>If you don't have a domestic ticket with CIV protections, then <a href=""http://www.eurostar.com/UK/uk/leisure/customer_care.jsp?rfrr=UK%3AUK%3AexpressBook_body_customercare"">phone Eurostar</a> as soon as things go wrong, so they can put a note on your account that you may miss your Eurostar due to delays. Next, try to find someone from the train company who has delayed you to write on your ticket / give you a bit of paper confirming the delay. This bit isn't required, but it does seem to help! Finally, when you get to the Eurostar terminal, queue up at the ticket desk, explain about the delay, show them the ticket for the delayed train, tell them you've already spoken to customer services, and ask nicely. (Whether or not you are already covered by CIV at this point is something that hasn't been tested in court, so no-one's quite sure, ditto for onward connections after). Generally, if you'd left enough time had the delay not happened, Eurostar will re-book you onto the next available service. </p>

<p>If you're delayed getting to the Eurostar station by something other than a train, YMMV, so it's probably best to leave more time for that. If you're getting a long distance Eurostar (eg a once-a-week train to the south of France), get there early as even if they can get you there another way, it'll take longer and not be as good! If you can buy a domestic ticket with <a href=""http://www.seat61.com/UKconnections.htm#Option%202"">CIV protections included</a>, that's the best as you know you'll be fine. Otherwise, Eurostar are generally very friendly and helpful, and when I've been delayed on a train getting to St Pancras they've always helped me out :)</p>

"Is there a standard power adaptor to use on airplanes?","13000","","<p>For international flights of 12-15+ hours, do the planes usually have AC power available in Economy? If not, is there a standard ""airplane power adaptor"" that can convert the DC into AC to power a laptop or other electronic item? Is this the same type of adaptor that you can use in cars, or is it a different plug type on an airplane?</p>
","<p>When power outlets were first installed on airliners, they used a special adapter called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EmPower_(aircraft_power_adapter)"" rel=""noreferrer"">EmPower</a>, which looked like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/k7G2Z.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The airlines obviously thought that frequent flyers would be happy to buy a new kind of adapter for all their gizmos. This turned out not to be entirely true... nobody wanted to buy these new stupid adapters, and the airlines eventually realized that it wasn't going to work. </p>

<p>So they are now installing ""normal"" power outlets... often special receptacles with all kinds of holes that can handle just about any kind of plug, US, European, or British. If they already installed the EmPower thing, they're regretting it and replacing it with standard receptacles as fast as they can.</p>

<p>There is no standard rule to decide if your flight is going to have power, except for the following vague rules of thumb:</p>

<ul>
<li>The higher your class of service (First vs. Coach) the more likely you are to have power</li>
<li>The longer the flight, the more likely you are to have power</li>

<p>The canonical way to find out is by finding out the exact aircraft you'll be flying on, and looking it up on <a href=""http://seatguru.com"" rel=""noreferrer"">SeatGuru</a> to see where the power outlets are and whether they are EmPower or AC.

"Hotel Pool FAQ and Etiquette","12988","","<p>For quite some time when traveling I was happy when I had access to a shower with non-freezing water, when my bed was not part of a shaky triple bunk bed in a basement and noise-level was low enough to be cancelled out with ear plugs.<br>
Then recently I ended up in a rather posh five star hotel and it was a nice experience as well. The hotel also featured an indoor and an outdoor pool and I ended up not using them, also because I was not sure about proper etiquette. So my questions is</p>

<p><strong>How do I use the hotel pool in a luxury hotel?</strong> </p>

<p>I.e.</p>

<ul>
<li>Do I get changed into pool clothes in my room and go to the pool in the hotel bathrobe? Or can I expect changing facilities there and am expected to use those?</li>
<li>Can I expect lockers for my stuff in the pool area or am I supposed to carry that around? </li>
<li>What should I bring and what can I expect to find there? (referring to towels, Shampoo, ...) </li>
<li>I am sure the pool use is included in my stay but are there other services that I would likely pay for and if so would that be added to my room bill or should I bring cash/cards/traveler cheques/gold/... ? </li>
<li>How do I find out about the pool dress code? (Bathing cap or not, tight swimwear only or the opposite, ...) </li>
</ul>

<p>I do know how to swim and have no qualms about going to the beach / lake / public pool, so no need to delve into that, I am really concerned about the etiquette of using a hotel pool in a luxury hotel. </p>
","<p>I stay in quite a lot of hotels (more than I realised when I added up the nights last year!), many of which have pools. All I can say in general is... There is no general rule!</p>

<p>So, what I do first is to grab the guest information directory thingy in the room (normally a binder or little booklet), and check in there under leisure or facilities or spa. Around half the time, the information will be in there. Though, not always where you'd expect - sometimes one section will say ""pool on level 2"" while another (maybe spa, maybe gym) will tell you about changing areas and lockers!</p>

<p>If that doesn't cover it, then I ring Guest Services or Reception, and ask them. I normally say something like ""I'm planning to go for a swim in the pool, and I was wondering if there are changing facilities there, or if I should change in my room first"". Sometimes they answer, sometimes they put me through to the pool / gym / spa to ask them. Generally have the full details within a minute of picking up the phone, so not bad.</p>

<p>If the hotel tells you to change in your room, there normally (at nicer hotels) will be a bathrobe in the room. Get changed, put that on top, take a towel if needed, and head on down.</p>

<p>If the hotel says there's changing areas at/near the pool, ask about lockers. Some you may need to bring a coin, others they'll swap for a room key. Others still offer somewhere to change at the pool, but no lockers, so either you then leave your stuff on a lounger / chair where you can see it, or you change in your room anyway!</p>

<p>Most hotels have towels on pool side, or just by where you go out. A handful don't, but they generally make that clear. If the pool isn't the hotel's only (eg it's shared with the hotel next door, or a gym that's open to the public), it's much more likely that you need to take one from your room.</p>

<p>If there's no changing at the pool, and no bathrobe, I'll either leave a tshirt on as I walk to/from the pool, or wrap a towel around myself.</p>

<p>You do sometimes get odd looks in hotel lifts when heading down to the pool fully changed, but more often than not it's followed by someone asking ""oh, is there a pool in this hotel?"" or ""what's the pool like?""</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>Oh, and tackling one other bit of your question about facilities - again it depends! Some hotels may have a bar at the pool, others a bar in the pool area, some may have a restauranty thing there, some may do pool-side food or drink service, some may have sunbeds / loungers / cabanas etc which you can use, all varies from hotel to hotel. Food stuff should be covered in the guest information, others may or may not, but if you ring and ask they'll know. Most paid-for services would let you charge things to your room, provided you met the hotel's requirements for that (eg had your key envelope with room number on), so you may not need cash even if there are extras at the pool. One exception is in countries with strong tipping cultures (eg the USA), where you might need to bring a bit of cash to tip staff, especially if they're sorting out ""free"" things for you (eg sorting you out the use of a poolside cabana, or keeping any eye on your stuff while you swim if there's no locker)</p>

","<p>Tuesday is national museum closing day in France.

Most museums close on some <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holidays_in_France"">public holidays</a> but not all. There are many exceptions, so always check before you go.</p>

<p>I think the reason why Tuesday was picked as a closing day is that normal people should be able to visit museums, so they are open on Saturdays and Sundays. Many shops are closed on Mondays, so museums are open that day for the sake of people who work in shops.

"Is it possible for Indian citizens to travel to Gilgit–Baltistan and Azad Kashmir?","12960","","<p>The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir_%28disambiguation%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kashmir region of the Indian subcontinent</a> and has been <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir_Conflict"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">under territorial dispute between India and Pakistan for decades</a>. There are two regions in particular that are claimed by India but under autonomous Pakistani control: the provinces of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgit%E2%80%93Baltistan"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gilgit–Baltistan</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azad_Kashmir"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Azad Kashmir</a>.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BocLk.png"" alt=""Disputed areas of Kashmir region""></p>

<p><strong>Is it possible, then, for Indian passport holders to visit these areas?</strong></p>

<p>(I was inspired by <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/7653/what-is-the-safest-way-to-travel-from-hunza-north-pakistan-to-kashgar-west-ch"">Nicolas Raoul's question</a> to ask this one.)</p>
","<p>It seems you'd be able to pull it off, but it'd definitely be extra hassle and you might be subject to extra scrutiny (not to mention the cultural tensions between the two nations).  </p>

<p><strong>Visas</strong></p>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.dgip.gov.pk/Files/VisaforIndian.html"">Pakistani government</a> says about tourist visas: ""A non-extendable tourist visa valid for 14 days is issued by Pakistan High Commission, New Delhi through approved tour operators/travel agents."" Depending on how strict they are about you visiting, you might have to get one of those through a travel agency.  However, if you can slide by with a visitor's visa, you should have less trouble: ""Visitors visa are issued to Indian Nationals to meet relatives, friends or for any other legitimate purpose. This type of visa is also issued to bonafide Indian businessmen for six months with three entries.""</p>

<p>In addition, it seems you can only enter/exit through certain areas as an Indian national: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Following are the designated entry/exit check posts for Indian
  nationals, coming to Pakistan:- </p>
  
  <p>i By Air Karachi/Lahore/Islamabad.
  ii    By Sea Karachi.
  iii   By Road Wagha.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Gilgit-Baltistan</strong></p>

<p>The Pakistani government actually has a <a href=""http://www.visitgilgitbaltistan.gov.pk/visa.html"">tourism website</a> for the region and they talk about visa requirements.  They seem to be the same as the rest of Pakistan—except for India (and Israel).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Pakistan Missions abroad are authorized to issue tourist visa for
  a maximum period of three months liberally to all foreign nationals
  except to the Indian nationals and the foreigners of Indian origin and
  the nationals of Israel. All foreign nationals, including tourists,
  are exempted from police registration, except the nationals from
  negative list countries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it looks like you might have to deal with some form of police registration or extra scrutiny.  Nowhere, though, does it say that Indian citizens are denied entry to the region.   </p>

<p><strong>Azad Kashmir</strong></p>

<p>I wasn't able to find much information on rules / visiting, even though they have a <a href=""http://tourism.ajk.gov.pk/"">tourism</a> website. The only thing I was able to find from the actual government site:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tourist  from all parts of the State of Pakistan can visit Azad Jammu
  &amp; Kashmir without any restriction. However, they are advised to keep
  their identity with them. Foreign tourists can visit Azad Kashmir
  except the areas situated within 16 kilometers along the Line of
  Control (LoC). Before planning their visit foreigners should contact
  Interior Ministry Government of Pakistan Islamabad for  issuance of
  NOC before visiting Azad Kashmir.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A NOC is a no objection certificate—basically a letter from the government saying that ""we're fine with so and so doing X, Y, and Z"".  I'd read over <a href=""http://www.lonelyplanet.com/thorntree/thread.jspa?threadID=2148327"">this thread from the Lonely Planet forums</a> and <a href=""http://www.lonelyplanet.com/shop_pickandmix/previews/pakistan-karakoram-hway-7-azad-jammu-kash-preview.pdf"">this page</a> (PDF warning) from the Lonely Planet Pakistan guidebook on getting NOCs and travelling in the area.  They don't explicitly mention Indian citizens (I have a feeling the tensions between the states would make getting an NOC harder, especially if you want to travel alone without a travel agency) though.</p>

"Is my U.S. driver's license valid in Europe?","12958","","<p>Can I drive using my U.S. (New York State) license in the European Union (if the answer depends on the country, please answer for Czech Republic)?</p>
","<p>You could simply get an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Driving_Permit"" rel=""nofollow"">International Driving Permit</a>. This, coupled with your US driver's license, is recognised in over 70 countries.</p>

<p>The American Automobile Association and the American Automobile Touring Alliance's <a href=""http://www.nationalautoclub.com"" rel=""nofollow"">National Automobile Club</a> are the only entities in the United States to issue IDPs.</p>

<p>As for recognising your country license, each EU country is different. No EU country is obliged to recognise an international license, even if already recognised by a fellow country.</p>

<p><a href=""http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/country/czech-republic.html"" rel=""nofollow"">From the State Department</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An International Driving Permit (IDP), available from AAA (in the United States only), must accompany a U.S. driver’s license; failure to have the IDP with a valid license may result in denial of an insurance claim after an accident.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So since you need an IDP for the Czech Republic, I'd recommend just getting it and then you're covered for any European country.</p>

"Food in hand luggage","12915","","<p>I'm flying with Ryanair soon, and would like to take a small amount of food with me in my hand luggage. In general, what are the rules/restrictions on this? I know that there might be some safety issues concerning on-board security, the risk of carrying diseases, etc.</p>

<p>Some types of food that I'm thinking of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Home made snacks (cakes, etc);</li>
<li>Bread / sandwiches;</li>
<li>Food in sealed container;</li>
<li>Food in a container that has already been opened.</li>

<p>Is there a list of guidelines that I should be aware of, to ensure that I'll be able to take everything with me on-board?</p>
","<p><a href=""http://www.ryanair.com/en/questions/can-i-bring-my-own-food-onboard/"" rel=""nofollow"">According to Ryanair</a>, you are welcome to do so.
As for diseases etc., the regulations usually regard meat and dairy products, but if you are traveling within EU, <a href=""http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/carry/meat-dairy-animal/index_en.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">you are ok</a>. Outside, however, it depends on the country.</p>

<p>In my experience, ham and cheese sandwiches have never been a problem on European flights, including those with Ryanair. As long as it is not liquid (see Edit) you shouldn't have any issues getting it through security and on board.</p>

<p>Edit:
Gathering the comments on non-obviously liquid items that will/may cause problems at security gates:</p>

<ul>
<li>Yogurt (no matter how dense) </li>
<li>Jam/Marmalade </li>
<li>Tinned fish (in oil) </li>
<li>Honey</li>
<li>Purees</li>
<li>Butter</li>

"What is the most comfortable way to sleep on a plane?","12912","","<p>Some people have the amazing ability to doze off whenever and wherever they are. For the rest of us, sleeping on planes is a constant battle of trying to get comfortable in a cramped space. There are lots of options: special pillows, leaning against the window, folding over flaps on the headrest, leaning on the shoulder of a friend next to you, etc. Certainly something must work...</p>

<p>What have you found to be the best way to comfortably sleep on a plane (in a standard economy seat; first class is a whole different world)?</p>
","<p>While there is plenty of good advice in the other answers, I feel I have some more to offer that is a little less spontaneous. Sleeping on a plane is a <strong>learned skill</strong> and it is improved by planning, preparation, and practice. You can change the likelihood of sleep from nearly nil to nearly guaranteed, but not if the first time you start to think about it is as the plane starts to taxi.</p>

<p>First, the booking. Generally you have some choice here. Should you leave early in the morning, or late at night? At 4pm, ensuring you'll be hungry after a few hours in the air, or at 8pm, when you're more likely to show up having eaten enough to last you through the night? If it's a 7 hour flight and you need to stay awake for 2 hours to get food, you're not getting more than 5 hours of sleep. Pick a flight that either won't require you to sleep much, or that lets you organize the rest of your day to maximize the time you have for sleeping. Also think about whether a glass of wine would help - it's much easier to get one (bought in the airport, say) at 7pm than at 7am. Here is also where you settle window/aisle (I like window because it gives me a wall to lean on and a few more inches of space from my seat to the wall), consider paying for more legroom in a premium seat for $100 or so more, and the like.</p>

<p>Second, the packing. NEVER count on the airline for pillows, blankets etc. Sometimes they don't get them. Sometimes they can't give you one until the seatbelt sign is off. Airline pillows are small and weird and most annoyingly, they're slippery and they fall between your seat and the wall. Bring your own. A bed pillow from home, one of those C-shaped things (solid or inflatable), something. I like an inflatable one with a VERY fuzzy cover and a little pocket for eyeshades:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kGLdD.jpg"" alt=""inflatable pillow""></p>

<p>I don't decline blankets or pillows from the airplane though - they are handy for padding the armrest so I can lean against it or over it without the edge digging into me.</p>

<p>Continuing with packing, I bring my own blanket in the form of a pashmina which folds very small but unfolds enough to cover all of me (6' x 2' I suppose.) I generally use separate blankets for my top and bottom half, to help the crew see that my seatbelt is fastened and to let me move more freely. If the airline doesn't give out blankets I'll use a coat on my legs. My pillow and blanket are familiar and comfortable, they smell right, and I never worry if they're clean. The eyeshade makes a huge difference also, both in keeping out the light and in telling people you are sleeping and don't want a drink, a newspaper, dinner, duty free, etc. And for me, the sensation of the eyeshade on my face reminds me I am supposed to be sleeping. Noise cancelling headphones and a playlist of relaxing and enjoyable music are also on the packing list. These are better than earlugs in my experience, though I always have a few earplugs in the bag just in case. Over-the-ear can be uncomfortable to lie on, so I use earbuds. Plug into the entertainment system when you board, put them in, go to sleep. If you wake later, switch to your playlist and put your seat back. When you have to put your seat up, switch back to their system. I also choose shoes I can slip off and slip back on rather than ones that need tying. Your laceups can be in your checked luggage.</p>

<p>So you chose the right flight and seat, you packed the right stuff and you're at the airport. Eat, drink, go to the bathroom. These are all good ways to pass the time while you're waiting to board. Also bring an empty water bottle with you that you can fill after security, or buy water in the airport. That way if you wake up thirsty you can immediately fix that and go back to sleep.</p>

<p>Now on the plane, all you need to do is sleep. Don't put the pillow around your neck. You have so little recline, you don't need to prop your head up. Put it between the side of your head and the wall. Put your ear in the centre hole so it doesn't get squished. Coat over legs, blanket over shoulder and chest. Snuggled up warm and cosy, listening to something you like, with a water bottle in easy reach and a clear ""leave me alone"" sign on your eyes, you will sleep. You just will. And trust me, it is so much better than a book or that movie you never got around to watching in theatres. You will get better at it every time.</p>

<p>If you wake up, especially if you're uncomfortable, change your position. Loosen your seatbelt as much as you can and sort of turn on your side. Or move your feet from on top of the carryon you stuffed under the seat in front of you, to next to it. Adjust your blankets a little. Move your pillow more under your chin. Your approach should be that you will do what you need to do to go back to sleep, not ""oh well I tried but I woke up."" Don't worry about what time it is. You won't miss your stop. If you wake up again, then try a third position. You'll find something comfortable eventually. If you feel anxious when you wake up, especially if you're getting caught up in the ""oh noes now I will only get three hours sleep, I am ruining my trip"" then try switching from your playlist to some guided relaxations and meditations. Many airlines have them in the inflight system, or you can bring your own. It's as good as sleeping in terms of refreshing your brain and body, and could (usually does) lead to falling asleep too.</p>

<p>Learn from each flight and adjust what you bring and do. You will become one of those people who finds it ""effortless"" and easy to sleep on planes. It's not that easy and then again, it is.</p>

"What's the easiest way to relieve oneself in a car?","12869","","<p>Ok, I know we're all adults here, but this is something that happens inevitably in most family trips I believe; it's occurred in our own family trips.</p>

<p>You're driving on the road to your destination. Suddenly, someone in the back or the front seat needs to go -- badly.  You see a sign that tells you the nearest rest stop is X miles away, and you know your kid/wife/husband/relative can't hold it in for that long until you get to a rest stop.</p>

<p>What do you do?  What is the easiest way to relieve oneself in a car, whether male or female? Do any of you have advice on what to do in this case? Obviously, I could pull over in wooded areas and have someone go in to the trees to relieve themselves, although this doesn't work in dry, parched land like you'd see when travelling through California (I-5) or Nevada.</p>

<p>Preferably looking for solutions that are the least messiest and easy to do, especially in a packed car.</p>
","<p>Bring a towel or blanket, some baby wipes, and optionally a small trowel or a stick you picked up along the way. A few small plastic bags are also helpful.</p>

<p>If someone (especially a small child) can't wait until you can exit, pull over at a safe spot. A safe spot has a shoulder significantly wider than the car, and you pull as far off as you can without risking the car sliding off the roadway and getting stuck. Make sure (by watching as you choose the spot) you have a good long view behind you (a straight stretch of road) so you will be able to get back on the road safely knowing no cars are coming, and a good long view ahead of you so that cars who are passing you can see there is no oncoming traffic and may give you a slightly wider berth.</p>

<p>Once pulled over, exit only through the passenger doors. If a child is the ""goer"" have an adult exit first, then the child. Once the ""goer"" is out of the car, walk a little further from the road, locate a good spot (see further) and have one or possibly two adults hold up the towel or blanket to screen the ""goer"" from cars passing by. If this is a new experience, make sure the goer does not have one foot downhill of the action, especially if they are going to squat. Watch for poison ivy, nettles, or other unfriendly vegetation that should not be contacted with bare skin. Also watch for insect activity to avoid a sudden and possibly painful interruption. If they're just peeing, you don't need to make a hole, but if necessary, make a very shallow hole first, then have the goer use it. Do not bury the wipe, nor any toilet paper - they don't decompose. Scrape a little dirt over the contents of the hole afterwards. Put the used wipes in the plastic bag for disposal at the rest stop. The wipes can also be used for handwashing.</p>

<p>When the goer is done and the pants are back up, the towel or blanket can be put back in the car and used next time or for any other purpose. You may find the wipes handy in other situations too.</p>

"What happens with checked luggage with an airport change?","12794","","<p>I'm considering two Miami - Zürich flights, which connect at New York. Both start MIA - JFK, but one continues with JFK - ZRH and the other with LGA - ZRH.</p>

<p>If I check my luggage at Miami, and take a cab from JFK to LGA, will I have to carry my bags and re-check them at LGA, or does the airline do this?</p>

<p>The cost difference (two people) is ~120 USD total. How much is the taxi, normally? Is an airport change worth the hassle?</p>
","<p>For the life of me I could not come up with a single itinerary that will fly Miami to JFK then LaGuardia to Zurich.</p>

<p>So if this is the case there are 2 different itineraries in play then you will need to collect your luggage and re-check it at the next airport to your final destination, which has been discussed in many forms on this site already:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/8314/re-checking-luggage-at-connecting-airports"">Re-checking luggage at connecting airports</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/16476/do-i-need-to-pick-up-my-luggage-and-re-check-it-between-washington-dc-and-and-s?rq=1"">Do I need to pick up my luggage and re-check it between Washington, DC and and Shanghai?</a></li>

</ul>

<p>So if you need to transfer from airport to airport you will have to collect your luggage.  Carry it to the Taxi $35-$50 + tip and at least an hour of your time then checking it for your next connection and so on.</p>

<p>Personally while $70 is not chump change is it really worth about 2 hours of your time?</p>

<p><strong>ADDITIONAL INFO</strong></p>

<p>Just found a way to create a connection with an airport transfer.  There is also a rule listed in <a href=""https://www.aa.com/i18n/Tariffs/CGR1.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">US-Canada Domestic Rules 205AA A.3.e</a> which states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Baggage will not be checked beyond a point at which the passenger is to transfer to a connecting flight, if that flight is scheduled to depart from an airport different from the one at which the passenger is scheduled to arrive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you will definitely have to pick it up.  Hump it to a taxi then check it back in at the other airport and continue. Personally I prefer convenience.</p>

<p>Ideally an answer would be valid/useful for airports all over the world but if you do need to narrow it down, I will be travelling from Frankfurt international airport (FRA).</p>
","<p>Right after security checks (at least in the terminal I used) there were two changing rooms that are probably used for extra security checks. </p>

<p>I asked the security staff if I could use it to get changed and their response was ""sure, of course"" so I went ahead and did. Indeed nobody even seemed to care. </p>

"Air Travel with an Electric Arc Lighter","12683","","<p>I have a rechargeable USB electric 'arc' lighter. It a similar model to the one shown <a href=""http://www.ebay.com/itm/TIGER-High-end-Low-Carbon-Grating-Electric-Arc-Rechargeable-Cigarette-Lighter-/291185911046?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item43cc086506"">here</a> (sorry for the ebay link, best I can find and I can't find a picture of it working). When activated it creates an electrical arc between two points -- it's not like the 'element' electrical lighters where a heating element gets hot (i.e. the old car lighters). </p>

<p>Does anyone know if this is likely to get confiscated by airport security? I know some lighters are supposed to be allowed but I've often had seen them confiscated anyway (particularly in China). But they were all gas/lighter fluid based lighters so this is different. Although it does seem to come close to being a 'torch' lighter which is explicitly banned (and from the outside it does resemble a torch type lighter). </p>

<p>I suspect that security will probably confiscate it anyway, if they're confiscating lighters. And I know it's not a good idea to argue. But perhaps someone has traveled with one of these before or can find some official documentation that I cannot. </p>
","<p>The <a href=""http://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/prohibited-items#9"" rel=""noreferrer"">TSA mentions</a> that lighters without fuel can be checked in, but cannot be carried on the airplane in the hand-carry luggage. Common lighters are listed with an exception:</p>

  <p>Common Lighters - Lighters without fuel are permitted in checked baggage. Lighters with fuel are prohibited in checked baggage, unless they adhere to the Department of Transportation (DOT) exemption, which allows up to two fueled lighters if properly enclosed in a DOT approved case. If you are uncertain as to whether your lighter is prohibited, please leave it at home.</p>

<p>However, this concerns ""common lighters"", which I would say yours isn't. In general, this item would rather resemble the category ""cattle prods"" since it creates an electric arc which are also allowed in checked-in luggage.</p>

"Your address at destination: What if you don't know any address?","12659","","<p>Often, when entering a country, you must fill a form that asks, in particular, where you will stay.</p>

<p>What if you don't know yet?<br>
Even worse, what if you don't have your guidebook in hand luggage, and thus can't even pick a hotel? (lack of preparation happens, especially when told by your company to immediately fly)</p>

<p>In such cases, would it be dangerous to write <code>Hotel Hyatt</code>? (because most big cities have one)<br>
Or will you get less trouble by just writing <code>Sorry I don't know, I will choose upon arrival</code>?</p>

<p>(not talking about North Korea nor Russia, where they actually check bookings)</p>
","<p>It'll depend on what you write, who you get at the border, and what else you do.</p>

<p>For example, I've seen a person not have a hotel when they arrived at US Customs.  He literally turned and asked anyone behind in the queue if they know the address of a hotel, and someone named the one from Pretty Woman on Rodeo Drive. So he wrote that in, and handed it to the border guard, who shrugged, stamped, and completed the process.</p>

<p>Now for a lot of countries, having that address down is rarely used.  It's handy in case of emergency if they needed to contact you (assuming you've not moved on).  </p>

<p>You may not intend to lie.  You might put down a hostel, get there, find they've lost your booking and are full, and you have to stay elsewhere.  You may even intend to go to town X, your car breaks down and you have to stay in some roadside inn.  Things do change.</p>

<p>However, it's an official government form from a foreign country.  You NEVER want to intentionally lie on these.  So if you do know the address, it's best to put it down.  And put down the truth.  I once spent 30 min in Orlando International Airport while the immigration officer pulled up the website of the place I said I was staying at, and checked the flight that I said my friend was coming in on, and confirmed the address and whether it was even possible to get there that night.</p>

<p>So to answer your question, yes, they can and do check.  If they can pull up the website, there's nothing stopping them calling the hotel to confirm your 'booking', especially if you don't have paper evidence of said booking.</p>

<p>Side note, I suppose you could try saying ""I'm staying with my friend, and meeting him outside, so don't know his address"" or something similar, if you really didn't want your friend's address on this, but then they might want to call the friend, and if your stories don't match....more problems. </p>

<p>Bottom line: honesty is the best policy here.</p>

"What happens if you arrive in Malaysia with a one-way ticket but are asked for proof of onward travel?","12576","","<p>As we know, most countries require that visitors have a return or onward ticket as a condition of entry.</p>

<p>But often, depending on where you're from and which country you're visiting, you won't be asked to show such ticket.</p>

<p>Now many backpackers like to travel without exact plans made in advance, including buying all one-way tickets when they are finished with one country and have decided where to go next.</p>

<p><strong>But what happens when you're travelling this way and they actually do ask you for proof of return/onward passage?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Are you sent back on the next plane at your own expense?</li>
<li>Will you have some opportunity to buy a ticket at this time?</li>
<li>Will this be unlikely to happen in the first place because the airport where you board will tell you whether you'll need a ticket?</li>
</ul>

<p>To make it all specific, I'm asking about my friend travelling on an Iranian passport who wants to fly into Malaysia with a one way ticket and travel around Southeast Asia.</p>

<p>Personally I've never been asked to show this proof in an airport but I have at land borders after visa runs and in immigration offices when getting visa extensions. <strong>But</strong> a friend who travels on a British passport was asked for this proof when she flew into Malaysia about two years ago. Lucky for her it was a rare occasion where she actually did have a return ticket.</p>

<p><strong>What will Malaysia do if you are asked to prove onward/return travel but only have a one-way ticket?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>I can't answer what Malaysia would do if they asked for such proof because when I arrived they did not ask.</p>

<p><em><strong>However</em></strong>, when I was checking in for my flight at the Air Asia X desk in Sydney they did ask me. And they did accept my $10 e-ticket for the train to Singapore as proof.</p>
","<p>When proof of onward travel is required, it is always the job of an airline to check whether your documentation is in place. If not, and if you have to be deported, I believe in this situation the airline has to bear the cost of flying you back; this is standard practice around the world.</p>

<p>Malaysia implements these requirements pretty unevenly. <a href=""http://www.kln.gov.my/web/guest/requirement-for-foreigner?p_p_id=infovisarequirementforeigner_WAR_infovisarequirementforeigner5231&amp;p_p_lifecycle=0&amp;p_p_state=normal&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=118_INSTANCE_L2uz_column-1&amp;p_p_col_count=2&amp;_infovisarequirementforeigner_WAR_infovisarequirementforeigner5231_struts_action=/infovisarequirementforeigner/visarequirementforeigner_action"">Citizens of countries which do not require a visa in advance</a> (like Iran) may or may not be checked strictly, the real requirement for onward travel in case of transit is for those who require visas / transit visas (Indians, Chinese, ...)</p>

<p>The simplest thing is to show you will be leaving the country, and for that I don't think an airline ticket is required. Get a cheap bus ticket with <a href=""https://www.ticket4u.com.my/transnasional/"">Malaysia's national bus operator Transnasional</a> - from Kuala Lumpur (listed under 'Wilayah Persekutuan') to Singapore costs only roughly $15 - a cheap price to pay just to tick a box if you're stopped at all.</p>

<p>Alternatively, buy a ticket from anywhere in Malaysia to Singapore with a low-cost airline like <a href=""http://www.tigerairways.com/"">Tiger Airways</a> or <a href=""http://www.airasia.com/"">Air Asia</a>. Don't pay more than $20-40 including taxes for it. The tickets are non-refundable but compared to cancellation charges of full-service airlines with refundable tickets are usually much higher.</p>

"How early do you need to get to the station for a Eurostar service?","12500","","<p>Do you have to be at the station a certain time in advance for Eurostar services? Or can you just rock up a few minutes before and jump on, much as you might do with many other European high speed trains?</p>
","<p>There is a minimum checkin time for Eurostar trains, which is generally
30 minutes before departure (see below for details), but it does vary.</p>

<p>Before listing the times, it's worth thinking a little bit about how
the Eurostar checkin process works, as that explains why it is as it is.
When you get to the station, you need to checkin with your ticket, either
using the automated ticket gates, or with one of the checkin counters
(normally only if you have a problem). The deadline is for going through
here. After that, there's normally a small queue (varies with the number of
services due out) before the security screening. You can take a <a href=""http://www.eurostar.com/UK/uk/leisure/travel_information/before_you_go/prohibited_items.jsp"">lot more onto
the Eurostar than a plane</a>,
but there are still <a href=""http://www.eurostar.com/UK/uk/leisure/travel_information/before_you_go/prohibited_items.jsp"">some restrictions</a>.
Your bags get x-ray'd, you go through a metal detector, then you queue up
again for the juxtaposed border controls. You show your passport, and clear
immigration for the country you're going to (either France of the UK, depending
on direction). After that, you're into the waiting area before boarding
(and frequent travellers can visit the lounge)</p>

<p>Boarding of Eurostar trains normally begins 20 minutes before departure, and
they tend to close the doors a minute or two before the scheduled departure
time so they can leave on time. For the ski trains, and summer Avignon service
to the south of France, boarding starts earlier, often 35 minutes before.</p>

<p><strong>For most people, on most services, the <a href=""http://www.eurostar.com/UK/uk/leisure/travel_information/at_the_station/check_in.jsp"">minimum checkin time is 30 minutes
before departure</a>.</strong></p>

<p>If you're travelling on a Business Premier ticket (the really expensive ones),
or you have a Eurostar Carte Blanche frequent traveller card (lots of
journeys in a year), then the minumum checkin is 10 minutes before. However,
as you do still need to clear security and immigration, you're probably
going to have to run to the train, and there won't be time to go in the lounge
with only 10 minutes, so getting there earlier is probably advised, especially at busy times!</p>

<p>For the long distance services to Avignon and the Ski Trains, the minimum
checkin is 1 hour (60 minutes) before departure. Boarding starts earlier for
these, and most people have more luggage, so it all takes a bit longer hence
the extra time. Anyone with <a href=""http://www.eurostar.com/UK/uk/leisure/travel_information/before_you_go/special_travel_needs.jsp"">special travel needs</a>
needs to add 30 minutes extra.</p>

<p>The minimum checkin enforcement varies a little bit. If it's quiet, you may
get away with 25 minutes, but that's about it. At a very quiet time, you can
clear security an immigration in about 5 minutes, but at busy times with
lots of queuing it'll take longer. At a busy time, they tend to be pretty
strict!</p>

"What does ""Shin"" in a Japanese train station name mean?","12499","","<p>Quite a few train stations have ""Shin"" in their name, then the name of the city. For example, Shin-Osaka, Shin-Sapporo, Shin-Kobe.</p>

<p>What does it mean, and does it indicate the station is for shinkansen (which in Japanese means ""New trunk line""), Japanese bullet trains?</p>
","<p>What usually happens is that originally, there is a station named X (which may or may not be named after the city where it is located). At some point it is decided that the area needs a new station, and that the new station shall just be named ""Shin-X"", which should be understood as meaning ""the new X"".</p>

<p>Sometimes the reason why a new station is necessary is that a new Shinkansen line to the area is planned and it is determined that the existing station is not suitable to accomodate it. This is what happened in Shin-Osaka for example: the area around Osaka station did not have enough room for the necessary developments.</p>

<p>There can be many other reasons why a new station is needed, however. In the case of Shin-Sapporo, it was to serve a new urban development (which incidentally was also named Shin-Sapporo). An interesting one is Shin-Rifu (in Rifu town, near Sendai) which was established when the Tohoku Shinkansen started operating, not because the Shinkansen actually goes to this station, but to accomodate employees and visitors of the neighbouring Shinkansen rail yard. The Japanese wikipedia page of a station usually has a ""History"" section where some background information about its establishment is given.</p>

<p>And sometimes Shin is just part of the ""actual"" name of the station, as with Shintoku station (in Shintoku city, Hokkaido).</p>

"ESTA application status stuck at ""Authorization Pending"". What can I do?","12466","","<p>As a British citizen, I recently applied for an ESTA visa waiver in order for me to travel to and present at an academic conference in the United States. To my surprise, they have added additional criteria based on travel to certain countries in the Middle East since 2011 (this change was apparently made in December 2015). I stated on my application that I had worked as a lecturer at a specific institution in the Kurdish region of Iraq for a three month period. I expected my application to be denied fairly quickly (although I hoped that it wouldn't) but having checked it several times, there has been no change to the ""Authorization Pending"" status when I check my application on the website. The top of the page (when I check my status) says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your travel authorization is under review because an immediate determination could not be made. This response does not indicate negative findings. A determination will be available within 72 hours.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It has now been 18 days since I applied - I understand that they may want to check my details more thoroughly and am more than happy for them to - but through various searches on google, I have been unable to find anyone else who had waited so long for a response!</p>

<p>Is it possible for the applications to get stuck in the system? Or is it far more that they're spending this time trying to determine whether I am a security threat? I've heard of people putting in a second application when the first takes a long time - would this be advisable?</p>

<p>Thanks for your time!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT - Adding this from an answer posted by the OP</strong></p>

<p>My status has officially changed today (20 days after application) and I have been declined the Visa Waiver.</p>

<p>Since the conference is in a month's time, I can still apply for a B-1 Visa but probably won't. Looking at the visa application website, it may be the case that I'll be asked to report my travel history over the past five years and although it's relatively uninteresting, I really do not have the time to put together all the documentation they might ask for, nor can I really be bothered to go through the rigmarole of an interview in London.</p>
","<p>Given the circumstances of your application and the recent change of US law, I think it is most likely that your ESTA application has landed on someone's desk for review by a human being.</p>

<p>The new law makes people who have visited Iraq since 2011 <a href=""https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/194"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ineligible for an ESTA, with some exceptions</a>. I think it is most likely that someone is meant to determine whether you qualify for one of the exceptions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Under the new law, the Secretary of Homeland Security may waive these restrictions if he determines that such a waiver is in the law enforcement or national security interests of the United States. Such waivers will be granted only on a case-by-case basis. As a general matter, categories of travelers who may be eligible for a waiver include:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Individuals who traveled to Iran, Iraq, Sudan or Syria on behalf of international organizations, regional organizations, and sub-national governments on official duty;</li>
  <li>Individuals who traveled to Iran, Iraq, Sudan or Syria on behalf of a humanitarian NGO on official duty; and</li>
  <li>Individuals who traveled to Iran, Iraq, Sudan or Syria as a journalist for reporting purposes;</li>
  <li>Individuals who traveled to Iran for legitimate business-related purposes following the conclusion of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (July 14, 2015); and</li>
  <li>Individuals who have traveled to Iraq for legitimate business-related purposes.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Is being a lecturer a legitimate business-related purpose? It might be, or it might not be. This seems to me to be the most likely thing holding up your application.</p>

<p>The obvious thing to do is to wait. But if your travel date is fast approaching, there might be some things you can try:</p>

<ul>
<li>Some people have reported that when they tried to apply for a new ESTA with one already pending, they received an error message stating that they already had an approved ESTA, and upon checking, their pending ESTA application had changed to approved.</li>
<li>Travel to the US by land does not require an ESTA. So you might fly to Canada and enter the US by land. If your application remains pending when you must travel, this may be an option. You may also end up having to explain the whole story to Canadian immigration, which could be a problem. Or if you're going to the southwest US, TIJ airport (Tijuana, Mexico) is a possibility, since you can <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/a/59674/3221"">literally walk into the US from within the airport</a>. I wouldn't try this if your ESTA is denied before you travel, though.</li>
<li>Contact a US immigration lawyer. This will probably be expensive and time consuming, but if you really need this resolved, then this should be at the top of your to-do list.</li>
<li>Have a member of the US Congress intervene. An American must make this request on your behalf.</li>
<li>Obtain a normal B1/B2 visa. It could be difficult to obtain one in time for your trip, but once you have it, you don't have to worry about this again for ten years. Hopefully enough time for the US to reintroduce some sanity to this program.</li>

"What to do without underwear on a 4 day trip?","12403","","<p>Ok, this might be a ridiculous question/situation but it's my situation. </p>

<p>I'm at a football camp in boston until Friday, and I've realized I forgot to pack any underwear (I wear boxers), I have the one pair I came with. I'm going to be pretty active for these days, so far my current strategy is to go commando at night, and wear the boxers only when I'm exercising. I can't get any from people or a store, does anyone have any ideas/improvisation tactics? </p>
","<p>I'm surprised that nobody mentioned the infamous ""flip them around"" technique. Arguably you can use one pair of boxers for four days if you flip them inside out and front to back. Indeed boxers, and tighty-whities, have two degrees of freedom which produce four possible rotations. This doesn't really work with thongs due to the difference in surface area between front and back. Just for kicks <a href=""http://www.letsrun.com/forum/flat_read.php?thread=3479369&amp;page=1"">here's a thread on a running forum discussing underwear and exercising (man I hope they're all kidding!)</a>.</p>

<p>For added comfort you should of course think of letting them dry as much as possible, or even washing them, since exercising in them inevitably means sweating in them. For completeness sake note that if you don't wash your sweaty boxers and rotate them four times you'll probably stink. A lot. </p>

"Is it illegal to take a piece of the Berlin Wall?","12375","","<p>As a keepsake for my traveling in Germany,  I would like to take a pebble from the Berlin Wall-is it illegal (or perhaps frowned upon) to do so? I'm aware that they sell (presumably fake) pieces in gift shops,  however to me that would defeat the purpose. 
Moreover,  I'm not entirely sure where to go to actually get a piece (I assume museums are protective of their assets).</p>

<p>EDIT: Thanks @Fiksdal for the answer - while the answer for this question may be fairly obvious, it seems like the legality has flexed over time (as @Jan pointed out, now people are too late to partake in it).</p>

<p>Perhaps even more importantly, when you Google 'Is it illegal to take a piece of the Berlin Wall', nothing useful shows up (save now for this question) </p>
","<p><strong>Edit:</strong> The new <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/a/77923/41775"">answer by Jack</a> is quite excellent! However, <em>unless doing something like that</em>, then:</p>

<p>There was a lot of leftover debris while the Berlin Wall was being demolished. That, however, was a long time ago and parts of the Berlin Wall are now being intentionally maintained<sup>*</sup> as a historical monument. Therefore, removing pieces of it without permission can now only be described as <em>vandalism</em>. </p>

<p><em>Vandalism</em> is a crime in Germany and punishable by fines, and/or anything from a few weeks to two years of imprisonment (depending on seriousness and history) according to German Penal Code <a href=""http://www.express.de/geldstrafen-oder-haft-diese-strafen-drohen-vandalen-22071224"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">(§&nbsp;303&nbsp;StGB)</a>.</p>

<p>Also, as @PeterM says in a comment, you may consider it just a ""pebble"", but this is an important historical monument, and it could easily be partly ruined if (hundreds of) thousands of tourists took a small piece each over the decades. Also, different people may have different opinions on what constitutes a ""small piece"".</p>

<p><hr>
<br><br>
<sup>I've been asked in several comments to explain why I consider removing pieces from the Berlin Wall to be vandalism.<br>The <a href=""http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vandalism"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">definition of <em>vandalism</em></a> is:<br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The act of deliberately destroying or damaging property.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Looking at this definition, I think it's self-explanatory that whenever you remove a part of any structure without permission, then that's vandalism. In the case of the Berlin Wall, it's also probably serious, because there's a risk that a large number of people will do it. That is, of course, not to mention the fact that the Berlin Wall is one of Europe's most important historical monuments, and carefully maintained as such. (At least parts of it.)<br><br>* = If you seek out one of the <a href=""http://www.seetheworldinmyeyes.com/historical-architecture/what-is-left-of-the-berlin-wall-after-25-years/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">obscure parts of the wall</a> (these may not be considered monuments, I'm not sure) you <strong>may</strong> find a piece of it that's already broken off and lying on the ground next to it. <em>Maybe</em> you could somehow manage to confirm that this was indeed once a part of the wall. Given such a lucky find, picking it up and taking it might not be illegal. Anyway, instead of going through all that trouble (confirmation, etc.), Jack's answer is probably a safer bet. </p>

"How to survive a timeshare promotional trip?","12338","","<p>Earlier this week my fiancé called Hilton to change an existing reservation and in the process was roped into booking a 3-night stay in Orlando for $99, as long as he agrees to sit through a 2-hour presentation. They say there are no blackout dates. It's a great deal, but I am always skeptical of these timeshare promotional trips. Searching online, it seems like <em>many</em> people have had bad experiences with these types of trips and consider them a scam. Common complaints are aggressive marketing tactics, hidden fees, and ""gotchas"" in the contract that void the promotional price.</p>

<p>Seeing as this trip is already paid for and non-refundable, we are very likely to take it. I trust Hilton much more than I do many other timeshare companies, but I am still very wary. <strong>How can we get through this trip while avoiding spending more than what we agreed to?</strong> In particular I'm looking for common hidden fees, things that would void our discounted price, and ways to get through the marketing pitch without purchasing anything (though that last one is likely off-topic here). I know you can't tell me what's in my contract, but I want to know what types of things I should be looking for or asking about.</p>

<p><sub>While my situation is specifically with Hilton Grand Vacations, I'm looking for advice that applies to timeshare promotional trips in general.</sub></p>
","<p>It's very easy, just smile and say no.  Yes, the sales pressure is high, very high, but...so what?  You are <strong>not obligated in any way</strong> to buy anything.</p>

<p>As for hidden fees, well...sure, there might be a resort fee and of course taxes, but you should settle all of this ahead of time, <em>before the presentation</em>.</p>

<p>How to handle it?  Well, it's just two hours with snacks and touring the properties isn't that bad, some of them are pretty nice.  You hasten the process by staying in motion, skipping the snacks, asking only superficial questions.</p>

<p>Also, do the presentation first, before any other activity, like right when you get to Orlando.</p>

<p>Note, you can't get out of the pitch.  That's the whole point.  All you can do is get it over with as expeditiously as possible.  And also note, both of you must be present.  They will not pitch to half of a couple.</p>

<p>I've done these on occasion and the presentations from the well know operators are not at all shady, Marriott, Hilton, Disney...</p>

<p>One counter I gave that the salesperson really had no good response for was points.  Say because of work travel, you have half a million* whatever points and that's good for two weeks a year for 10 years.</p>

"How do I identify an airport’s official free Wi-Fi network?","12313","","<p>While traveling in the Berlin Tegel airport (TXL), I wanted to get on Wi-Fi. I found three unsecured networks in addition to a number of password-protected networks.</p>

<ul>
<li>_Free_TXL_WiFi</li>
<li>airberlin</li>
<li>Berlin Tegel Airport WiFi</li>
</ul>

<p>I had no idea which of these were an official Wi-Fi network provided by the airport and which were provided by other people, potentially for malicious purposes like capturing my network traffic. Presumably the official one uses a captive portal to allow internet access.</p>

<p>Is there any way to determine which Wi-Fi network is the official one provided by the airport? Would airport staff such as at the ticketing booths know? Are there official lists available somewhere?</p>

<p>I’d like an answer that is applicable to airports generally, rather than specific to the Berlin Airport. Also, please don’t just give a blanket “don’t use any public Wi-Fi network” answer; I know there are risks associated with it, but sometimes it is a necessity and so I want to know how to identify the airport-provided one.</p>

<p><sub><a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/q/2565/11661"">Do all German airports lack free wifi?</a> suggests there are no official Wi-Fi networks, but the answers are six years old, so it’s not clear if things have changed or if <em>none</em> of the networks I saw were official.</sub></p>
","<p>Unfortunately, you cannot. Nowadays anyone can use a small portable device to create a bogus Wi-Fi network, so even if you know SSID (network name), you still cannot be sure you are connecting to the right access point. </p>

<p>For instance, if the official network is ""Berlin Airport Wi-Fi"", anybody can create their own network named ""Berlin Airport Wi-Fi"", and there is no way to be sure you're connecting to the airport's Wi-Fi instead of the bogus one.</p>

<p>It's relentless and it's very annoying. I've no doubt I'm being singled out because I'm about as white as one can get but I'm still curious...  do Indians do this to each other?</p>
","<p><strong>It's not ""Indians"" that are pushy.</strong></p>

<p>Not ""Indians"". That makes it sound like everybody. It's ""rickshaw drivers, taxi drivers, and some street vendors in India.""</p>

<p>I never found pushiness from regular people other than when queueing up to buy tickets at the train station. Just from people in certain professions, and mostly in touristy areas.</p>

<p>So it's not really based on race or nationality, but on profession and opportunity.</p>

<p><strong>Yes. It's definitely worse for foreigners / westerners / ""white"" people, but ...</strong></p>

<p>You can actually chat to these people. I try to keep a good sense of humour and ask them if they hassle Indians as much and they tell me no because the Indians don't like to pay them much money. They really like it when you treat them like real people rather than just annoyances. It might not make them leave you alone but it leaves you both happier being friendly with them than being adversarial.</p>

<p><strong>How to avoid a lot of pushy drivers and vendors.</strong></p>

<p>Keep away from the busiest tourist zones when you can be somewhere else. Sometimes you can't avoid it, like exiting a train station, or arriving or departing from a tourist site.</p>

<p>But other times, such as getting things done in a city like Mumbai (finding a restaurant, buying supplies, getting the feel of a place) all you have to do is take some road other than the main tourist road. In Mumbai the next street over from the main tourist street I found everybody so nice, nobody pushy at all. The pushy types follow the biggest chances of money.</p>

<p>Even if you're in a busy touristy place and you want something, avoid the loud drivers and vendors. They are good at getting people's' attention and then getting their money. But there are also plenty of meek people in India who can't bring themselves to act like this. They might have the next fruit stand over from the loud pushy guy. They might be waiting patiently in their rickshaw elsewhere in the train station grounds rather than crowding around the exit doors. Go to those quiet people instead. The noisy ones see that they've lost you as a potential customer and look for somebody else to annoy.</p>

<p><strong>When regular people are pushy.</strong></p>

<p>As I mentioned the one place I found non drivers non vendors to be pushy is when queueing to buy train tickets at stations. Toward the end of my month in India I finally learned the trick for this. Be nice and happy and smiley and friendly and say ""namaste"" to people.</p>

<p>It was amazing. People suddenly saw me as somebody like them rather than as an ignorant outsider tourist. They filled out my forms for me, they pushed other Indians out of the way to get my form to the ticket seller behind the window!</p>

<p><strong>India has a different flow, you have to learn how to go with it.</strong></p>

<p>Just because of its unique properties, like the huge population, the huge gap between rich and poor, the poverty of the poor, the crowding, etc, it's not like most places you might travel.</p>

<p>For this reason the ways you normally go about things can cause some friction that will make you grumpy and tired.</p>

<p>Getting grumpy and tired isn't nice. The best thing to do is to take the opportunity to learn about people and learn about yourself by thinking of new ways to do things that are different to how you would normally behave elsewhere, but work smoother in India and leave you less grumpy and tired.</p>

<p>It's not easy, especially when you first arrive, especially if it's hot and humid. But when you finally ""get it"", it's really rewarding and you will fall in love with India!</p>

The situation has been made <a href=""http://greatergreaterwashington.org/post/18635/metro-fare-signs-confuse-the-riders-who-need-help-most/"">even worse</a> because of the addition of the $1 surcharge for paper farecards (and the deeply unpopular experiment with ""<a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/local/metro-fare-calculator/"">peak of the peak</a>"" surcharges). The software is more than 20 years old and has had <a href=""http://wamu.org/news/14/11/14/metro_farecard_machines_upgraded_after_scam_uncovered"">security problems</a> as well.</p>

<hr>

<p>DC Metrorail fares vary by distance and time of day; <strong>there is no such thing as a ""single trip"" or ""multiple trip"" farecard</strong>. Whether using the WMATA <a href=""http://www.wmata.com/fares/smartrip/"">SmarTrip</a> card, Baltimore <a href=""http://www.mtacharmcard.com/"">Charm Card</a>, or a paper farecard, you're simply adding cash value to the card, which gets deducted electronically when you exit the platform at your destination. Don't think of the farecard as holding a certain number of trips, as it would for instance in the New York City Subway.</p>

<p>At the stationmaster kiosk you'll find a table that gives you the regular (rush hour) vs. off-peak fares for every possible destination from the station. (The list at the top of the machine is for paper farecards, and includes a $1 surcharge). Let us suppose, for simplicity, that you are traveling on a weekday morning from Virginia Square to McPherson Square for a breakfast meeting, departing at 7:00am and returning at 9:00am. The fare during those hours is $2.50 each way. You have a SmarTrip card with $0 stored value.</p>

<p>When you tap your card onto the pad in front, it will ask you how much value you want to add, with a default of $20. This is what the ""add value"" and ""deduct value"" labels refer to. If you only want to add $5 to the card, press the down buttons until the value on the display reads $5. If, on the other hand, you want to add $50, press the up buttons until the display reads $50.</p>

<p>Then, when ready to pay, insert the required funds, whether by credit/debit card or by adding cash bills or coins.</p>

The whole road around the mountain (almost all 14 km of it) is considered a sort of holy site. The path is like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/l77rv.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/l77rv.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>There are millions of pilgrims walking around this mountain every year. I've never seen any of them wearing footwear of any kind. There is the paved road, and there is asphalt on the side. The pilgrims walk barefoot on both. The whole road around the mountain is considered holy, similarly to a temple. Wearing footwear in a Hindu temple is <a href=""http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/plea-against-salman-srk-for-wearing-shoes-in-temple/article8115024.ece"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">considered a serious offense</a>.</p>

<p>How will it be received by the pilgrims and locals if someone walks with some type of footwear on such a road?  How bad is it compared to walking with footwear into a temple (the latter being totally unacceptable.)</p>

<p>Has anyone here tried walking such a long distance barefoot on stone? Should I just go for it?</p>

<p>I guess if the pilgrims can do it, then so can I! I think I'll just go barefoot. But maybe I can get some helpful advice here.</p>

<p>If I do go barefoot, how can I, as a barefoot-noob, mitigate the discomforts that come with that? (Heat, stepping on stuff, hard stone base, etc.)</p>
","<p>Walking barefoot probably won't be as bad as you expect.</p>

<p>For one thing, that trail is walked barefoot by a lot of people, all the time.  A lot of the things that make barefoot walking painful are likely to be accounted for - the will brush the path for small stones or sharp bits that would hurt to step on.  For walking on the road, it might be wisest to stay close to the middle, since that part will be cleanest (I mean from pebbles and painful-to-step-on things).  It should be pretty smooth.  When I have been to India, it's pretty typical to find places where people are expected to be barefoot to be pretty careful about how foot-friendly the floors are, even if most people have tougher feet.</p>

<p>The texture might be a little rougher than you're used to, but since it is meant for people to walk barefoot on, they will probably have paid more attention to texture than roads or tile walkways where people are expected to wear shoes.  If everyone is welcome, they may have taken extra care for people not much used to walking barefoot.  I think it won't be too much different from walking barefoot on inside floors, except for the longer distance.  If you're worried about direct heat from sun-warmed floor, it usually isn't bad if you're walking since your foot keeps moving - just watch where you stand while resting.  Places that have smooth, worn stone are often more comfortable for walking on then earth or grass (the different textures can feel rough or conceal pokey little bits).</p>

<p>I can't say how offended anyone will be if you wear shoes, that will depend on how flexible they're willing to be.  If the path is open to everyone, and they get a lot of tourists, they may be resigned to it (though they will still prefer not).  Taking off shoes has to do with cleanliness, not tracking dirt in from outside - although for something like this it's much more symbolic than literal.  If you are thinking about having a backup, having an obviously new, clean pair might help (sort of like inside vs outside shoes), and be more respectful - although that will only matter to those who know that's what you are doing.  I would recommend you try barefoot, and only pull out shoes if you really can't, but it is between their tolerance and your choice.</p>

<p>Alternately, you might consider socks for your backup... the act of taking your shoes off is the relevant part, so for some reason I think that socks might give a little protection without offense.  You can take off your shoes, and wander around in socked feet while still being 'shoe-less'.  I have seen it in some places (including temples), but again the tolerance of the people there will be the deciding factor.  For myself, I think walking in socks is more annoying than barefoot, but a thick pair might cushion your feet if you're having problems.  I would suggest you carry them, and only put them on if needed, though. Also, they <em>will</em> get dirty, and can't be washed as easily as feet, so you might want to think about that, and the wear and tear vs the quality of your socks, and how thick they are in terms of heat as well as protection.</p>

<p>Beyond that, take all precautions due to the walk itself - make sure you're up for the long walk (or be prepared to stop or leave if you aren't), take breaks if you need them, have enough good drinking water (don't get dehydrated), have anything you might need for the time or length of walk, snacks or a hat or whatever (or know what will be available nearby).  Walking barefoot is only part of the experience - part will just be walking the distance.</p>

<p>Also, walking barefoot more (as others suggested) might help toughen up your feet a little - but I would <em>actually</em> suggest walking in sandals would be a lot more helpful in preparation.  The way your foot moves and flexes when walking in sandals is different from walking shoes - it is more similar to walking barefoot, the sandal protects the bottom of your foot from pebbles on the ground and adds a little cushioning, but that is mostly all.  It will help you figure out how the lack of extra support from your shoe will effect you walking over longer distances - especially if you pick up the cheap flat sandals, instead of the extra cushioned support ones.  And it will be easier than needing to actually find distances that are barefoot friendly.</p>

"Should I be worried about airline safety","12227","","<p>I'm making a trip to Thailand at the beginning of March. I've booked tickets from Bangkok to Phuket on AirAsia. However, after reading recent articles around AirAsia recent airline crash, I was sceptical of the airline choice.</p>

<p>Should I arrange for a different airline? Is airline safety something I should be worried about? I've never flown in an Asian airline before so I don't have much confidence in non EU airlines.</p>
","<p>Air Asia is quite a large airline with a few more operating names. Basically if you plan to visit south east Asia, there is a very good chance that the cheapest flight you find would be an Air Asia one. </p>

<p>AirAsia is, unfortunately considered a dangerous airline considering the number of crashes they had (<a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-2908531/Ranking-world-s-dangerous-airlines-includes-troubled-AirAsia-Malaysia-Airlines-scores-highly-safety.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-2908531/Ranking-world-s-dangerous-airlines-includes-troubled-AirAsia-Malaysia-Airlines-scores-highly-safety.html</a>), but they are somewhat exaggerated in my personal opinion. </p>

<p>However, keep in mind that air travel is one of the safest methods of transport. I have flown with Air Asia X several times, and never noticed anything different in terms of security precautions they have compared to other airlines. They use standard A320 mostly, and is a recognized international airline. Their prices are so low because you'd be charged even for the water onboard (they cut costs a lot), not because of any less security or safety.  </p>

<p>Lastly, if your flight is Bangkok to Phuket, you will find some other flights relatively cheaper too. You can even transport by road if you are too concerned. If you would like to fly with them anyway (I think you should), don't forget to try out the Nasi Lemak. It's the best food I've tasted at 33,000 ft so far.  </p>

"Is it possible to enter Russia by train 1-1.5 hours before the visa validity period starts?","12162","","<p>A friend of mine is taking the Train from Finland to Russia. She has now paid and sent the Tourist visa application, with the requested validity being from 3 to 16 August.</p>

<p>Now she's considering entering the evening before, so I would like to ask the following:</p>

<p>The Train she wants to take arrives at Vyborg (first Russian station) on 2 August at 22:22, then St Petersburg at 23:27. The Russian border guards board the train at Vyborg and do the checks while the Train is travelling between the stations, so sometime between 22:30-23:00</p>

<p>If the visa validity starts on 3 August, and she is checked at 22:30-23:00 the evening before, what would happen? Are they very strict about the starting date if it's within 1-1.5 hours, and how bad would the consequences be?</p>

<p>Although they do the check while travelling between Vyborg and St Petersburg, could they simply wait until arrival in St Petersburg, then hold her in custody for 30 minutes and then stamp her in?</p>
","<p>There are things I would try doing and there are <em>the others</em>. Attempting to enter Russia before my visa is valid (or attempt to overstay my Russian visa) even if by a few hours only clearly belongs to <em>the others.</em> The visa is valid from a minute before 00:01 of its first validity date and until a minute after 23:59 of its last validity date. Entering the country earlier (even two hours) is illegal entrance.</p>

<p>While the Finnish conductors and even the passport/toll people often seem rather nice (and I have heard one joke around with the passengers), the same cannot be said for the Russian ones. I perceive them as people I would not want to cross.</p>

<p>Even if the Russian border personnel does not board until Vyborg (Viipuri), they will know that the train entered their country at 22:00 and that you need a valid visa for <em>today</em> if you are on that train.</p>

<p>On an unrelated note: I read it on VR’s (Finnish state railway’s) website (but can’t find it anymore) that if you intend to travel with Tolstoi, the night train from Moscow, you <em>must</em> make sure that your visa is valid for an ‘additional’ day, since the train does not cross the border until well after midnight.</p>

<p>So: No, just no. If your visa is valid from day X, do not enter Russia until day X.</p>

"Are there any rules of thumb for the most comfortable seats on a long distance bus?","12126","","<p>I traveled recently by bus and I was wondering about comfort.</p>

<p>In a plane there are a couple of rules of thumb when it comes to picking a place that provides a bit of extra comfort. (E.g.: sitting in an emergency exit provides a bit of extra leg room, not sitting right next to the toilet avoids some noise from it, etc.)</p>

<p>Does the same apply to a bus? Are there better seats in relation to the comfort they provide?
I am not only thinking of leg room (although that is also nice) but also feeling less bounces, as well as maybe noise reduction and horizontal drag when turning. Any other things I may be missing are a plus.</p>

<p>For clarification, I am considering long distance buses (that connect cities), also called coaches, rather than city commute buses.</p>
","<p><strong>If motion sickness is a consideration</strong><br>
As a child suffering from motion sickness I would always try to sit between or above the wheels. In modern buses you do not see the wheels but the area between the wheels is still the area with the least swaying motions.</p>

<p><strong>Forward view</strong><br>
If you want forward view, the front seat on the other side as the driver is great. In some buses there will be several to chose from as they are on different levels.<br>
An other advantage of the front row seat on many coaches (as mentioned by @nsn in his answer) is that there is no row further forward with seats that recline into your face. 
A disadvantage of the front seats, specially in countries with many road accidents, is that you are more likely to suffer, (or die,) if the bus hits something head on. </p>

<p>My last multiple day 'bus' tour was in a 20 seater that was filled with the maximum number of passengers so the 'guide' seat next to the driver needed to be used. I loved it though it had less leg room and no place to store a carry-on bag. The views were amazing.</p>

<p><strong>Traveling with a group</strong><br>
But for those who like to hang out together while in a bus, the back seat still offers the best options.
Some buses (the kind that have been used as city bus in the early part of their life) have sets of seats where two face backward, making a group of four for friends, without having to be in the back of the bus.</p>

<p><strong>Window or aisle seat</strong><br>
View to the left or the right does make a difference but unless you know where the best views will be, it will be a guess.<br>
I prefer aisle seats, as with those you have pretty good views one way and acceptable ones the other, while window seats give good views one direction and almost nothing the other way.</p>

<p>Other reasons to chose window or aisle is the space you get and the fact that others will pass.<br>
Those that need more than average space, for reasons of build, size or because being stuck in a small space is uncomfortable, the aisle seat is the prefered one.
When needing to get up several times, bathroom or just stretching your legs, you will find the aisle seat the easier one, specially when sitting next to a stranger or when your traveling companion is likely to sleep most of the time.<br>
When sleeping, or trying to, in an overnight bus, the window seat allows for more positions to relax, including leaning against the window.<br>
Sitting in the window seat you will less likely be disturbed by people walking past. 
And when in a bus/coach where not everybody is to be trusted, the window seat also gives less access to your things for people walking past.<br>
The trade off is that you have less access to and less control over the items stored overhead.</p>

<p><strong>Left of right of the bus</strong><br>
If you want the best views out of the side windows of a bus, check where the best views will be.<br>
Other considerations are where the sun will be, as sitting on the sunny side on a hot day and looking into the glare for most of the day will be less pleasant. This is made less important if the bus has coating on the windows and if it has good airconditioning.</p>

<p><strong>Not all buses are build the same, exceptions happen</strong><br>
If there is the option to reserve a seat before comming into the bus, remember not all buses are the same.
In some cases the aisle seat behind the driver is a good choice, if you can see out to the front of the bus. On many buses the view to the front is over the driver and the space for the feet is nice.<br>
In some buses you have no forward view at all and less space for your feet.  </p>

<p>My grandmother had a knee that she could not bend. She would request the seat next to the emergency exit as that would have enough space for her to sit. But in some cases the seat was not suitable and she had to change the request while getting into the bus the first time. She traveled bus tours for many years, with a company that made the people move to the next seat after every stop, so that all people got the better and the worse seats. She did get freedom from that moving, but it would not always get her a good seat.</p>

<p><strong>Double decker buses, up or down</strong><br>
If you want steady, not too much sway, top level of double decker bus is not good — the movements of the bus will be 3 to 10 times as strong on the higher floor.<br>
Someone suffering from motion sickness should check whether they feel alright on the top floor of a bus. Not all sufferers will need to avoid top floors, and those who suffer in some buses might feel alright in others.  </p>

<p>The views are better, specially those from the front seats. And often there are two sets of front seats available.  </p>

<p><strong>Extra tips for those who suffer from motion sickness</strong><br>
Watch what you are eating and drinking before and during the trip.<br>
Avoid foods that make you want to burb, check whether you react badly on fatty foods, foods that make you fart (also on the day before a travel) and other foods that might upset the system.<br>
There might be foodstuffs that help you fight attacks, like mints or boiled sweets you suck on. Talk with people in your family if there are more that suffer the sickness as well, as there are bound to be stories of what helps and what to avoid.</p>

<p>If there is a vent for the airconditioning you can aim, have it at least at its lowest level and aimed just in front of your face, unless you want it fuller open and aimed differently of course.
When there are only fixed vents, you may want to chose your seat to have one near, as long as the air coming out smells nice.<br>
Also, the seats behind and below the escape hatch when opened will have a better air quality than the average for the bus.</p>

<p>For those of us who suffer badly, frequently or violently, warn the driver and ask for him to open the door, when safe to do so, on request.<br>
Sometimes a flow of fresh air will calm down the urge, in other times being able to aim out of the bus will be much easier than using a bag.<br>
And always carry a suitable container to accept more than one time of being sick, or a series of 'just big enough' ones. 
Best if they are easy to close safely and sturdy enough to withstand the liquid. Paper bags are OK as long as you can dispose of them soon after use.
Strong plastic bags will keep much longer. But smells coming out will not help you nor other people around, so close and keep closed unless needed.</p>

<p>Most people suffering motion sickness can not read on a bus, some exceptions can read but can not stand being bored. So do test and it may turn that you can read.<br>
Always take something that takes away boredom, like music or a spoken book on headphones, or use your brain to distract you, like dreaming up a story or doing your tables of multiplication.</p>

"What rights do you have in China to appeal stuff being taken off you in transit?","12116","","<p>I debated this, but I think it's askable.  I just flew transit through Beijing. Did NOT enter the country.  You still have to go through security though, but whatever, it just takes time.  Until I got called aside for questioning about my Anker Power Charger (<a href=""http://www.lktown.com/products/product_detail/44.html"">this model</a>).</p>

<p>The conversation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Security:</strong> ""What is this? It has no label""<br>
  <strong>Me:</strong> ""It's a USB charger, for charging my phone, for example""<br>
  <strong>Security:</strong> ""It has no labels showing how much power, it's not allowed into China""<br>
  <strong>Me:</strong> ""It's not going into China, I'm only in transit! Also, where, anywhere, is there a sign saying it must be labelled?"" (It had been, but was worn off)<br>
  <strong>Security:</strong> ""We can keep it for you, one month""<br>
  <strong>Me:</strong> ""What use is that if after a month you still won't let me take it on a flight?""<br>
  <strong>Security:</strong> ""Sorry, It's not allowed into China""<br>
  <strong>Me:</strong> ""It was MADE in China!""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyway, despite my protests, it was removed from me, as well as similar items from other passengers (I got to see a lot of them while having this discussion).</p>

<p>Essentially, however, I had no leg to stand on. They could have claimed my laptop computer for all I knew, and I couldn't see any way to protest, get a claim, or anything like that. </p>

<p>So I guess my question is - is there a way to get documentation of the event, and claim for it later, or a way to officially protest, say from the airport OR the airline, given nobody warned me they'd be looking at and confiscating power banks with worn off labels?</p>
","<p>Did you get some sort of receipt?  Do you know exactly which kind of ""security"" official confiscated your item?  If not, you'll have a very hard time proving anything even happened, although you can try your luck with the airport's complaints line at +86-10-96158.</p>

<p>In any case, the airline is not responsible.  Security rules are laid out by the <a href=""http://www.caac.gov.cn/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Civil Aviation Administration of China</a> and enforced by airport security, which can be border police (边防部队), public security (公安部), random non-police rent-a-cops, etc.  You presumably ran into somebody who's taking a rather over-zealous interpretation of whatever ""smash the terrorists"" campaign is currently in progress.</p>

<p>And yes, they <em>could</em> take your laptop if they wanted to, or arrest you and sentence you to ten years of re-education through labor camp for that matter -- you're a foreigner at the mercy of a communist dictatorship, after all, and yes, <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/18561/what-is-the-real-legal-status-of-an-airport-transit-area"">the transit area is still very much legally a part of China</a>.

"A swim to die for — where in the world can I do one?","12093","","<p>Several years ago I entered the <a href=""http://www.escapealcatraztri.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Escape From Alcatraz triathlon</a> as I wanted to swim from Alcatraz to San Francisco.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xfSIL.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xfSIL.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p><em>Source: <a href=""http://www.dolphinclub.org/swimming/escape/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.dolphinclub.org/swimming/escape/</a></em></p>

<p>I was scheduled to go on a work trip at the time and this worked out perfectly. Unfortunately the trip was cancelled and I never got to do it. I subsequently entered a couple of times later but never made it through the random entry cut; apparently it's heavily over-subscribed every year.</p>

<p>Obviously <em>the</em> major ""big-swim"" is a channel swim.</p>

<p>But really that just looks like torture and costs the price of a large brand-new car and you have to book it 5 years in advance.</p>

<p>Question: Has anyone got experience (whether directly or via friends/colleagues) of some <em>reasonable</em> but not wallet-emptying swimming event that you you would want to tell your grand-children about, like swimming from one country to another or something? I don't want to train for a year (been there, done that) for some event and end up doing something that I'm just going to feel miserable doing. I'm not looking for a race, but something with other entrants would be good. I'd prefer it not to be a marathon-solo event, but just something that contains a memorable long swim as evoked in the Alcatraz photo above.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I don't like leaving a question with an unawarded answer so I reviewed the answers with a view to which event I would actually take part in.</p>

<p>The Hellespont / Bosphorus / Dardanelles swim(s) have a definite appeal. Swimming from one continent to another across shipping lanes closed just for the event sounds epic.</p>

<p>The Freedom swim sounds good too, but it's too cold for me. I can swim in cold water if I have to. But I don't have to. So I won't.</p>

<p>There were a few lake swims including the Sun Moon Lake swim which sound like they'd be enjoyable, but they don't really tick the ""to die for"" check-item. ""Only 20000 other people besides me managed to finish...""</p>

<p>Some people took ""to die for"" too literally, and seemed to want to suggest something that would be the last thing I ever did...</p>

<p>The Rottnest swim looks amazing. A 20k swim would be a major part of my day though! Also, I'd need to organise a support boat and a qualifying swim.</p>

<p>Aleks G provided a pointer to the World's top 100 open water swims and I had a look through those. One of which was the Bermuda round the sound swim at (up to) 10km. The HQ for this swim is a hotel I've actually stayed at and the water temperature is 25C. Perfect.</p>

<p>However, I'm going to select AE's answer as accepted.</p>

<p>Many thanks for the great answers!</p>

"Can I stay in the airplane toilet during landing?","12022","","<p>For safety purposes all airlines make you go back to your seat when you are in the toilet just before landing.</p>

<p>But, what if you really had to <em>go</em> and don't come out even after persistent knocking. What protocols do flight attendants follow in such a situation?</p>

<p>UPDATE (6 August, 2015): <a href=""http://www.thelocal.se/20150806/pilot-breaks-down-toilet-door"">Here</a> is some recent news about how a pilot in Sweden handled the situation.</p>
","<p>One of the steps of preparing the cabin for landing is checking that all passengers are seated and buckled up, no passengers are using the toilets and toilets are locked (it can be [un]locked from outside). The reasons behind checking the toilets for passengers during landings and takeoffs are related to both safety and security.</p>

<p>The safety related reasons are obvious, landings can be hard and you sitting in the toilet can be dangerous. Security related reasons are also obvious, the aircraft is closer to the land and most likely over a city, which make the sabotage plans have bigger effects.</p>

<h2>What will the crew do</h2>

<ul>
<li>The crew will knock on the door, and ask you to come out. </li>
<li>They can also unlock the door from outside and open it. </li>
<li>They can remove the whole door easily if you were to keep locking it from inside (lavatory doors are equipped for this). </li>
<li>The crew will also inform the captain about the situation, depending on the crew judgment, they can call security upon arrival, or call the onboard air marshal. </li>
</ul>

<h2>What should you do</h2>

<ul>
<li>DO NOT resist by any means, not verbally and not physically. </li>
<li>If they ask you what are you doing, tell them the reason clearly, do not say vague stuff like ""I do not feel well"", just say it clearly, something like ""I have diarrhea"". </li>
<li>If they want to open the door to make sure, open it for them, if they try to open the door from outside, do not resist it. Most likely they will take a quick peek and close the door. </li>
</ul>

<p>Once they are sure you are simply doing nothing wrong, they won't escalate it. </p>

<p>Remember, the cabin crew will deliver the message to the captain depending on the first impression they get, that impression can be a <em>threat</em> impression, or a <em>a guy with bad stomach</em> impression. The captain will react according to the first call since it is a landing which is considered a critical phase in the airlines business, the reaction can be as extreme as declaring an emergency landing, or as simple as ""tell the guy to hang on to something"". </p>

<p>Finally, the reaction will be different from one airline to another, country to another, crew to another. In some countries I would expect the reaction to be extreme in the name of security, while in some others (like in Asia) the crew might be more understanding. In any case, the crew are humans, and they do understand human needs.</p>

"Getting to Cappadocia: Nevsehir or Kayseri Airport?","12011","","<p>We (my wife, our 3.5 year old kid, me) are planning to visit Cappadocia in April for about about 4 days, following a stay in Istanbul.</p>

<p>According to google maps, it takes 1 1/2 hours from Kayseri Airport (ASR) to the Göreme/Uçhisar/Ürgüp region where we plan to stay and only 50 minutes from Nevşehir Airport (NAV). Several transfer service offers I found talk about an hour from Kayseri to Göreme, however. (We will probably rent a car either way.)</p>

<p>Since it seems Nevşehir sees only two flights a day I guess it will also be also easier to find our way around there, this seems to be the quicker way (with only marginally more expensive flights). However, since Kayseri seems to be worth a (half?) day trip on its own, flying there would allow visiting it first (there are flights from IST at convenient times; visiting before the return flight is not an option as we want to leave in the morning to catch a connecting flight at IST) and save the extra trip from and back to Göreme.</p>

<p>Is my reasoning correct? If so, which would be the more convenient option?</p>
","<ol>
<li><p>Your reasoning is correct. </p></li>
<li><p>Kayseri + rental car is the most convenient option. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>You have much more choice to and from Kayseri: better schedules and better prices, through competition. Moreover, the car rental facilities tend to be better at Kayseri. And it is not that further. Anyway, the drive is a quite relaxed one.   </p>

<p>Renting a car is definitely a good idea to explore that region. You will be more flexible. Getting from Göreme to more remote places like Mustafapaşa, Ihlara Valley or Kaymaklı is much easier and quicker with a car than with public transport. And you will be at ease to visit Kayseri. Indeed, if you have the time, stop by for a couple of hours. It's worth it.</p>

<p>An alternative would be to use an airport transfer, pulbic transport when possible and eventually take part in organised trips to the more remote areas or rent a car for that purpose on a daily basis. The organisational effort is however much bigger. You also lose some flexibility and spontaneity. </p>

<p>A last word on the airports. Check carefully if your flight to Kayseri is operated from Istanbul Atatürk Airport (code IST). There is another airport called  Sabiha Gökçen (code SAW). The latter is 50 kilometers from what one would call the city center. And transportation to and from this airport is by far not as straightforward as from Atatürk airport. </p>

"Transfer between Milan airports: Malpensa - Linate","11997","","<p>Recently I've booked a flight with a layover in Milan. I've realized that the transfer is between different Milan airports: Malpensa (MXP) and Linate (LIN).</p>

<p>I've already found a shuttle bus to transfer: <a href=""http://www.malpensashuttle.it/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.malpensashuttle.it/</a></p>

<ol>
<li>Maybe someone can suggest any cheaper and faster way to get from one airport to another (3 adults, 2 kids)?</li>
<li>If I have some 9-10 hours between the flights maybe it's worth making my route through the city center? </li>
</ol>
","<p>In my opinion the shuttle bus is the cheaper option because the total price will be 52 euro (13 euro each adult, 6.50 euro each kid between 2-12 years).</p>

<p>For comparison, taxi ride price from Malpensa to Linate is 85 euro.</p>

<p>In addition 5 people will have a lot of bags, so the shuttle bus is the best option in order to carry them easily.</p>

"Can I use a US cash machine when my PIN has 6 digits?","11997","","<p>Some friends told me that it is problematic in the USA to use cash machines when you have a 6 digit PIN on your card, because most cash machines in the USA only accept 4 digits. Therefore I have two questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>How big is the fraction of cash machines that only accept 4 digits PINs? And where are the primarily located?</li>
<li>Do I have to change my PIN at home to a 4 digit PIN or are there any other useful alternatives?</li>
</ul>
","<p>There seems to be a <a href=""http://www.fodors.com/community/europe/atm-pin-number-length.cfm"">lot of discussions</a> going back to 2005 and <a href=""http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2007/07/why_an_atm_pin.html"">here is another one from 2007</a> on the length of PINs w.r.t. to US banks but here is the thing.</p>

<p>There are ATMs(Cash Machines) that are owned by banks and there are cash machines that are owned by other companies and are installed at any place you can think of the thing is there is no way to know what fractions of Cash machines are limited to 4 digits and which aren't.</p>

<p>Your bank may have relationships with other banks outside home country like <a href=""http://locators.bankofamerica.com/locator/locator/LocatorAction.do"">Bank of America in the US</a> if you look at international locations.  On top of this it may have branches in those countries, so you can be reasonably sure that ATMs in your bank's ""Global ATM Alliance"" or their overseas branches will be able to accept 4+ digit pin.</p>

<p>If you come up on a standalone ATM it usually states who owns or runs them like ATMs in <a href=""http://www.duanereade.com"">Duane Reade Pharmacies</a> are run by <a href=""http://www.chase.com"">Chase</a>, which is as if you are going to a Chase bank branch and are unlikely to have any problems with long PINs, others may be some private companies that just placed it in the corner stores and potentially not accept any longer then 4 digits.</p>

<p>Also if you read the discussions I linked you can see that in some cases just first 4 digits may be enough to identify you to the ATM, so you may want to check with your bank, whether this type of scenario will work in your case.</p>

"Is it normal to walk around an (American) hotel in pajamas?","11986","","<p>I recently spent a weekend in a hotel with a bunch of friends and colleagues. To help cut down on costs, some of us shared rooms.</p>

<p>I like reading before I go to sleep, but my room-mate was tired and went to sleep early. Since I didn't want to bother him with the lights, so I went looking for a different place to read. I discovered that my hotel had a ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_room"" rel=""noreferrer"">Great Room</a>"" with plenty of tables and chairs, arranged around a fireplace.</p>

<p>I would have been very comfortable reading in that room, as I might in my own living room, but I didn't quite feel like doing that since I wasn't sure if etiquette demanded being fully dressed in that kinda-public space.</p>

<p><strong>Is it okay to walk around a hotel in pajamas/sleepwear?</strong></p>

<p>If it makes a difference, this hotel was in America. But I'm also interested in more global answers, if the information is available.</p>
","<p>In the US, it really depends on where you are staying.  </p>

<p>In a big hotel in a city, it would be expected that you wear street clothes or even casual business wear in the public areas.  Granted you could get away with wandering down the hall to get some ice or a soda from the vending machine in your pajamas, but lounging in the lobby or a reading room and such in pajamas would be frowned upon. (though not enforceable unless they have a posted dress code)</p>

<p>In a smaller guesthouse, bed &amp; breakfast, inn, etc lounging around in your pajamas would likely not be an issue, as they try to present more more homey atmosphere, not the big city business atmosphere.</p>

<p>Overall the fancier the lodging presents itself, the less likely pajamas will be acceptable.  The more casual, more home like they present themselves as, the more likely it is OK.</p>

"Comparative safety of countries in Central America","11950","","<p>When considering general safety for travelers visiting a foreign country, how do the Central American countries compare (Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama)? Are some significantly more safe or dangerous than others, or are they all in similar situations? </p>
","<p>All of the capital cities are dodgy, but some only in certain areas.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Belize</strong><br>
<strong>Belize City</strong> and <strong>Belmopan</strong> both have bad reputations, but they're the only capital cities in Central America I haven't been to.</li>
<li><strong>Costa Rica</strong><br>
The most developed and safest country in Central America.<br>
<strong>San José</strong> <em>feels</em> safe compared to the other capitals and people do go out at night. However, I was constantly pulled aside by older American expats to warn me how dangerous the city is. I mostly assumed they hadn't been to any of the neighbouring capitals to make a comparison.</li>
<li><strong>El Salvador</strong><br>
One of the friendliest border crossings I've ever had and people in rural areas were always friendly and I never felt in danger. However I did go on a tour with other backpackers I met with a guy recommended in one of the travel guides. One of our group had her camera stolen in a high-walled beach compound he took us too. He made a big display of calling the police and having them check locked rooms etc, but I had a bad feeling and was sure he was acting and stole it himself.<br>
Long distance buses do not run at night.<br>
<strong>San Salvador</strong> has more razor wire and armed guards than anywhere I've been. The city centre was destroyed in an earthquake decades ago and now the area is mostly occupied by a slummy market. Street kids are everywhere. People don't go out at night.<br>
I had found a little place with breakfast a couple of blocks from my hostel and was reading a newspaper I found there one day slowly in Spanish. An article was about a city minibus hijacked in broad daylight a few days earlier just a block or two away. If I recall correctly the driver and conductor of the bus were murdered for refusing to pay. I guess it was a <em><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maras_%28gangs%29"">mara</a></em> related crime.</li>
<li><strong>Guatemala</strong><br>
<strong>Guatemala City</strong> has a deserved bad reputation. For a couple of years I had never met any person who had visited the city without being robbed. Now I've been there several times myself with no incidents and I quite like the city. The cheap accommodation is in a different <em>zona</em> from many of the amenities you might need so you may have to take taxis or city buses between them. People don't really go out at night. Long distance buses do not operate at night.<br>
<strong>Antigua Guatemala</strong> is beloved by tourists and expats who believe it's much safe than the capital. However the two cities are very close and criminals do make the short trip to pray on tourists. Years ago I was told of criminals entering a hostel in Antigua and raping every female in the place. So don't let its beauty lull you into a false sense of security.<br>
Even rural villages are not without risks. Some years ago villagers in <strong>Todos Santos</strong> believed a rumour that foreigners were stealing children and turned on a tour group which resulted in the bus driver and a Japanese tourist killed. (<a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/731981.stm"">BBC report</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Honduras</strong><br>
Didn't suffer the civil wars that most of its neighbours endured but also didn't enjoy the tourism boom of Costa Rica so is still very poor. Long distance buses do not run at night.<br>
<strong>Tegucigalpa (Tegus)</strong> is my favourite capital city in Central America. People do go out at night but will warn you that it's not safe. Many of the cheap accommodation options are not in Tegus itself but in its poorer dodgier twin-town, <strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comayaguela#Comayag.C3.BCela"">Comayagüela</a></strong>. A friend I met there who had plenty of travel experienced was robbed twice in one day in this area, once in her accommodation where a man came in pretending to be her husband in an emergency as an excuse to take all her stuff. Stay in Tegus instead.<br>
Hondurans do seem to like to get drunk and fight when in groups though, and the fights are uglier than I'm used to in developed countries. I spent <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Week"">Semana Santa</a> at <strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omoa"">Omoa</a></strong>, a beach ""resort"". And witnessed much throwing of bottles, breaking of glass, and loss of blood, even vehicles with drunk drivers speeding through crowds. We always made sure to get back to the hostel before it got too late.</li>
<li><strong>Nicaragua</strong><br>
Gets a special prize for being the first place anybody managed to pick my pocket after about 15 years of travelling to some pretty dodgy places. Long distance buses do not run at night.<br>
As a tourist you are most likely to be in Grenada, León, and Ometepe. These places are a bit grimy but always felt safe to me. Some of the border cities with neighbouring countries had bad reputations but were no problem for me.<br>
<strong>Managua</strong> also lost its city centre to an earthquake but in its case it was never rebuilt. A huge park was made in much of the area, but not many people feel safe enough to go there. Partially surviving buildings with surely no water or electricity are now slums. You do not see tourists walking around. People don't go out at night. Instead of a city centre there are now about five huge shopping malls. These are safe and middle and upper class people congregate in them. The problem is getting to and from them from your accommodation. It's a very easy city to get lost in because most streets do not have names, let alone signs and it has its own system of directions rather than north, south, east, west.</li>
<li><strong>Panama</strong><br>
<strong>Panama City</strong> was my other favourite city in Central America. Here people go out at night and there are very good tourist police. But watch out because some of the cool parts of the city are not right next to each other, and some dangerous slums are interspersed around the place. One of them is right next to <strong>Casco Viejo</strong>. I also found the city buses from the main bus station totally unfathomable even with some knowledge of Spanish. It's far out from the city so you shouldn't attempt to walk like I did.</li>
</ul>

<p>I haven't been to Central America for about five years now so some of this may be out of date. I make it sound a bit scary but in fact I love it and would definitely go back. Since the question is about safety I didn't include too many anecdotes of good experiences (-;</p>

<p>Currently Norway is considered to be the most developed country in the world by that index, but looking at <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_requirements_for_Norwegian_citizens"">Visa requirements for Norwegian citizens</a> one can see that not all countries are fully open to them.

","<p>As a rule of thumb, <strong>the worse the visa regime, the worse the country's regime</strong>.

Or, in the case of the United States, suffering from bed-wetting hysteria about foreign terrorists.</p>

<p>China is somewhere in the middle of the spectrum: not particularly bad as far as visas or regimes are concerned, but still pretty paranoid about foreigners snooping about where they shouldn't (eg. Tibet without a tour guide) and with a strong preference for more state control rather than less.  Inertia is also a factor: no bureaucrat ever got fired for imposing more restrictions, whereas letting a bad apple in may be a career-limiting move.</p>

"How on earth can I use a Canadian toilet without splashing myself?","11837","","<p>The last few days I had to use Canadian toilets. Now I'm from Europe and I'm used to Central European toilets:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ujv4d.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>As you can see, the water is really far down the toilet and if ""things"" fall in there, you won't get splashed. On the other hand, toilets in Canada look more like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WtN1w.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>As you can see, there is quite a huge flat area in the toilet that is normally full of water. So every time I take a dump I splash myself with water.</p>

<p>Seriously, how can I avoid that?</p>
","<p>Well I wish you had used a photo of a cleaner European toilet for comparison. What will the Canadians think?!</p>

<p>Indeed this is typical of North American toilets. The same applies down in Good Ole USA too. In fact I've seen much higher water levels than this.</p>

<p>There are two answers really:</p>

<ol>
<li>Man up and take it! In some places in Europe they have a much crazier thing next to the toilet called a <em>bidet</em> and you don't want to know what that does!</li>
<li>Some of the more sensitive people in that part of the world mitigate the problem by creating a layer of toilet paper over the surface of the water before commencement of activities.</li>
</ol>

<p>Since you brought up this particularly tasteful topic I have some related observations:</p>

<ul>
<li>A gentleman using a low-water toilet can aim at the porcelain to reduce the chance of waking anybody unfortunate enough to be sleeping within earshot. With a high-water toilet there is only the noisy option.</li>
<li>High-water toilets seem to have a propensity to overflow. It seems to occur or at least be mentioned in American sitcoms and I've definitely seen it happen at a friend's place in LA, but I've never seen a low-water toilet overflow.</li>
<li>High-water toilets, so the justification goes, provide total submersion for unpleasant substances thus reducing the propagation of nasty odours.</li>
<li>High-water toilets put on a much more exciting show when flushed. Rather than just ""foosh"" and it's all over with a low-water toilet, you'll often see the contents of the bowl turn into a whirlpool at an accelerating pace until everything is banished into the abyss with an accompaniment of merry gurgling sounds.</li>

"Can I enter the USA? I have dual citizenship (Japan and USA), but I have been to Iran with my Japanese passport","11833","","<p>I have dual citizenship (Japan and USA). I have been to Iran with my Japanese passport.</p>

<p>I would like to know if a US citizen with dual citizenship should hand in both passports when entering USA, and, if the other passport has arrival visa of Iran, can the US government deny me entry in the USA?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>I would like to know if dual nationality US citizen should hand in both passports when entering USA</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's nothing requiring a US citizen to show foreign passports on entering the US, or even to mention other nationalities.  As mentioned in other answers, there <em>is</em> a US law requiring you to ""bear"" a US passport when you enter the US, which strongly implies that you must also <em>use</em> it to do so.</p>

<p>As far as the immigration interview is concerned, once you establish that you are a US citizen, the interview is over and you must be admitted.  (You can continue to be detained, however, for reasons related to the customs inspection, or for investigation of other crimes.)</p>

<p>I have never shown my foreign passport to a US immigration inspector, because I've heard a few anecdotes from people who've done so and had some degree of trouble as a result.  I am always tempted to show it to see what kind of reaction I get, but so far my desire to get home and get some sleep has always prevailed over my curiosity.</p>

<p>From the CBP Inspector's Field Manual, which is available in at least <a href=""https://foiarr.cbp.gov/streamingWord.asp?i=910"" rel=""noreferrer"">two</a> redacted <a href=""https://www.shusterman.com/pdf/cbpinspectorsfieldmanual.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">versions</a> online (emphasis added):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>When you are convinced that an applicant for admission is a citizen of the United States, the examination is terminated.</strong> This is not to say that your role as an inspector is always completed at that time. Listing of the subject in a lookout system may dictate further action, such as notifying Customs or another agency of the person's entry.</p>
  
  <p>It must be emphasized that the grounds of inadmissibility contained in 212(a) of the INA are applicable only to aliens. Consequently, the examination of a person claiming to be a United States citizen is limited to matters required to establish present citizenship. <strong>Once you are satisfied the person being examined is a U.S. citizen and any required lookout query has been completed, the examination is over.</strong></p>

"Why was there no immigration control flying from Dublin (DUB) to London Southend (SEN)?","11755","","<p>So I recently made a return journey from London Southend (SEN) to Dublin (DUB), flying out of SEN and into DUB on Saturday on Aer Lingus, and back to SEN on Sunday via a similar Aer Lingus flight.  In Dublin I did have to go through passport control (I received a stamp because I am non-EU).  </p>

<p>But on the return flight back to SEN there was no immigration control at all (like a domestic flight).  Was this some mistake?</p>

<p>I also asked another friend who had flown back from DUB to London Standsted (STN) and although they did have immigration control, there was a separate ""Entry from Dublin"" line which bypassed most checks, again my friend is non-EU.</p>

<p>So was this just a mistake? Or does the UK accept entries from Dublin/Ireland and just trust everyone coming in?</p>
","<p>This is due to the Common Travel Area Zone (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Travel_Area"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Travel_Area</a>) and is not a mistake.</p>

"How to create a travel history","11725","","<p>I am an Indian student in Germany. Recently, I had applied for a tourist visa for the US and had it refused under 214b. I do not have any travel history either apart from some of the Schengen countries for which I have no proof in my passport. So it is completely blank and only has my Schengen residence permit for 2-3 years. </p>

<p>I thought of applying to the UK to visit my sister and also go to Ireland but it turns out the UK, Ireland and the US share information. I do not know as to whether this will create a problem in me getting a UK visa. Because both UK and US do not have system to appeal in case of refusal of visit visa. The same applies for Canadian, Australian visa, etc. I have friends in these countries too and I would like to visit them some day and tour the country. I do not wish to get a reject from Australia, Canada or the UK or a country with strict visa policy but I do wish to visit them someday. </p>

<p>In such a case, how do you go about getting stamps/visas on your passports from different countries and create a travel history so as to show the officer that you are a traveler and you are not a potential immigrant? Do countries like the UAE, Sri Lanka, add to credibility? Also what about the countries in Europe where Schengen visa is not applicable?</p>
","<p>You build a travel history by doing the obvious: travelling!</p>

<p>Because you're ultimately seeking to enter certain developed western countries, I am going to recommend that you travel to other developed western countries, which have relaxed or no visa requirements for your nationality. This list, unfortunately, is quite short.</p>

<p>For a quick reference you can check <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_requirements_for_Indian_citizens"">Wikipedia's list of visa requirements</a> for ideas on where you might travel, but as it can always be out of date or incorrect, you should verify before you make travel plans.</p>

<p>The places which stand out as good possibilities are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hong Kong SAR: <a href=""http://www.immd.gov.hk/eng/services/visas/visit-transit/visit-visa-entry-permit.html"">No visa required for a stay up to 14 days.</a></li>
<li>Taiwan: Holding a valid visa from Germany, you are eligible for <a href=""https://oa1.immigration.gov.tw/nia_southeast/"">up to 30 days with online Travel Authorization Certificate.</a></li>
<li>Philippines: Holding a valid visa from Germany, you may receive a <a href=""http://www.philippine-embassy.org.sg/news/2012/05/visa-free-entry-of-indian-nationals-with-ajacssuk-visa/"">visa on arrival for a stay of up to 14 days.</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you just need a holiday on a warm beach, there are many island nations, mostly in the Caribbean, which offer visa-free access or visas on arrival to Indian citizens. Your only problem with these is, depending on which you choose, transiting the US, Canada, Australia or New Zealand, all of which will require you to have a transit visa. This will require some very creative searching for flights, but it can be done. Alternately, <em>transit</em> visas are often much easier to obtain than tourist visas, and there are many people who have been denied US tourist visas who have successfully obtained US transit visas.</p>

<p>If you go this route, the one that stands out to me is the British Virgin Islands, which requires no visa and can be reached fairly easily from Europe without transiting the US (sample routing: MUC-CDG-SXM-EIS). There are several other countries you might choose from as well.</p>

<p>Parking in the garage could be expensive, but many businesses do <strong>validation</strong> of certain garage parking, and thus you can often park for free if you're willing to purchase something in a participating nearby business:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Safeway in downtown has an underground parking lot with free validation; you can purchase groceries, a sandwich or a drink at Safeway, and park for free for a couple of hours (2 hours, IIRC); Safeway's underground lot is in the middle of the same building on a side of which Safeway is located, entrance is from a mid-street parallel to San Fernando (use lower entrance, upper is for the condominiums).  Note that since 2012-01-01 it's no longer legal for Safeway et al to provide free plastic bags in San Jose, so, bring a bag, if needed, or expect to pay at least 10&cent; or so if you need one on the spot.</p></li>
<li><p>Flames Eatery &amp; Bar is located in the corner of some garage parking structure on 4th Street, adjacent to SJ/SJSU Library; you can park in the said garage, get some food at Flames, and get your parking validated (which, in the daytime, provides only a couple of hours of parking, but in the evenings and weekends is good for the whole night/day).  I've also noticed that if you exit the garage after hours (say, at 02:00), then the gates are just open, so, at least sometimes, they seem to not enforce validation during the night in the said structure.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Also, generally, you can park on all streets in downtown <strong>after 18:00 or 19:00</strong> (and perhaps after 20:00 or 21:00 near SJSU) for free; and all meters are usually completely free on Sundays.</p>

<p>If you need to be in downtown during the <strong>daytime</strong>, and are willing to walk 10 to 20 minutes to downtown, then you can usually park for free and without any hourly limits just on the outskirts of the downtown.  Generally, all street parking north of Julian St is free (other than within Japantown San Jose), but you still need to be careful to park properly and according to the signs; I've once got a parking ticket before noon by supposedly parking too close to the driveway of the area which didn't have any parking limits (the guy in front of me parked too far off the other driveway, perhaps it was a bad-faith resident who was trying to keep two spots to themselves).</p>

<p>Note that since the summer of 2012 it's illegal to smoke in most public places in San Jose: outdoor patios in the restaurants, queues and bus-stops are supposed to be smoke-free in San Jose by the city ordinance.  (If you're a social smoker, Sunnyvale downtown on Murphy St wants to hear from you!)</p>

"Passing through airport security with autism","11639","","<p>I am a young adult with autism (Asperger's to be precise). While there are many resources on how to travel with kids with autism, resources on how to do so if you have it yourself are rare to nonexistent. </p>

<p>Anyway, I have a lot of trouble with security checks. The fact that I have to separate from my things (including my plush, which helps me in stressful situations), go through a scanner and pick up my things again before someone runs off with them completely stresses me out. I feel extremely pressured by the people behind me and it ends up being a very uncomfortable experience.</p>

<p>I have a couple countermeasures currently. I organise my bags at home, so I only need to take my laptop out. I make sure there is nothing in my pockets beforehand and I make sure I wear a 2 piece outfit. Nevertheless, it still is a terrible experience. Going through currently takes more energy from me than any other part of a trip. Is there anything I can do to make this a smoother experience? </p>

<p>I hold a Dutch passport. I frequently visit the UK and somewhat rarely (once or twice a year) other countries. </p>
","<p>I understand that logic doesn't always help in times of stress, but the first thing I want to assure you is that people are not going to run off with your things. This is something we all worry about but that essentially never happens. The folks who manage the checkpoint are monitoring and your things are not out there without you for more than a few seconds.</p>

<p>Second, you mention that your plush helps you. Could you procure a small square of plush fabric? You could keep this in your pocket - there's no requirement that your pockets be empty, merely that they be empty of metal. Fabric alone will not set off any detectors and you can put your hands in your pocket and calm yourself if you have to wait a moment before you go through the scanner.</p>

<p>Third, forget the people behind you. The pressure you feel is not really from them. You owe them no obligation. They are waiting, they have their own issues, but they will never say ""great trip today, the guy in front of me in the security line was so quick!"" What's more, if such a person existed, they would say that about <strong>you</strong> because you're not pulling things out of 4 different bags and pockets, having to go through the scanner twice because you left your keys in your pockets, and so on. You're already faster than most of the people in the line. You have no obligation to set some sort of land speed record by not hesitating, not waiting with your stuff (I do that), or just walking at the pace you prefer.</p>

<p>Fourth, reward yourself for completing this worst part of the journey. Whether it's an expensive coffee, a magazine, a bar of chocolate -- buy something fun and frivolous right after the security check. Something you wouldn't normally get yourself. The day may come when you're planning a trip and find yourself looking forward to that dark-chocolate-and-orange bar waiting for you on the other side of security.</p>

<p>Ideally, I'd like a little bit more information than that! Such as where they are, how much they cost, what's provided, how to pay, what condition they're in, that sort of thing. Anyone know?</p>
","<p>Because Kings Cross station is one of the handful of big stations both owned and managed by the infrastructure operator Network Rail, the best source of information isn't National Rail Enquires (as normally would be the case), but <a href=""https://www.networkrail.co.uk/london-kings-cross-station/"">Network Rail's own station page for Kings Cross</a>, and more specifically <a href=""https://www.networkrail.co.uk/london-kings-cross-station/facilities/"">the Kings Cross station facilities page</a></p>

  <p>£5, pay at Excess Baggage, soap included. Towels available - deposit required.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is almost all correct....</p>

<p>On arrival at Kings Cross, head towards platforms 9-11. Go past platform 9 3/4 (really!), and by the stairs up to the Parcel Yard pub is the Excess Baggage Company office. Go in there, pay them a fiver, and they'll give you a receipt.</p>

<p>Next, follow the corridor by the Excess Baggage Company signposted as Toilets. At that barrier, ring the bell, and show them your receipt. They'll get you a towel (no charge/deposit) and some shower gel, then unlock a hidden door in the appropriate toilet area (male/female). You then go in and lock the door.</p>

<p>The shower, at least on the male side, is in good condition and quite large. The non-shower area in the room is a little small, but does have 3 sturdy coat hooks. One downside - no shower curtain, so you'll need to hang most things up to avoid it getting wet!</p>

<p>Plenty of water pressure (maybe too much given no shower curtain...), nice and warm water, decent shower gel and pretty good towel. For a fiver, and after a long journey, it's not bad.</p>

<p>Why am I not allowed to buy alcohol at the store after 11pm in Russia?</p>
","<p>It's a law that's designed to reduce public drunkenness / alcoholism, especially at night when you don't want loud, rowdy and sometimes violent drunk people in the streets. Sometimes vendors try to circumvent these laws by selling e.g. a very expensive plastic cup that comes with a free can of beer when you buy it : ), but there have been crackdowns on such things, I don't know how the current situation is and I suspect it varies from city to city (and I've seen that in some places the locals who are prone to drinking know very well how to still get alcohol after the cut-off time). By the way, if you think that not selling alcohol after 11 is strange, check out the ""no alcohol on the 1st day of the month"" law in Mongolia!</p>

<p>See e.g. <a href=""http://proverky.net/prodazha-alkogolya-nochyu-shtrafyi-dlya-ip-i-ooo/"">this site</a> (in Russian) which talks about the restriction on alcohol sales, including beer, from 11pm to 8am, Russia-wide, except for cafes/bars/restaurants and duty-free stores.</p>

"What will happen if I overstay in Sweden by 1 day?","11576","","<p>I am a Canadian Citizen going to Sweden on the 90 day visa-free short stay. I am wondering if it is a big deal to over stay by one day. I'll be arriving on the 30th of May and I want to leave on the 28th of August (which is one day over). The cheapest flight I can book is on that day, otherwise I have to pay about 100 - 200 dollars more for an earlier flight.</p>

<p>(Keep in mind, I can't afford to cause problems that would prevent me from being able to come back to Sweden, as this is where my girlfriend lives, and I plan on moving there eventually) </p>
","<p>Staying for more than 90 days would be breaking the law, unfortunately for you. Moreover, the 90-day rule applies to all of the Schengen area, and the Schengen Agreement is now part of EU law. Therefore, by overstaying you would be breaking law of the entire EU, and also the non-EU Schengen members.</p>

<p>The actual penalty for overstaying depends heavily on the circumstances, but there are generally three kinds of penalties that would apply, from most likely to least likely:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A fine. No long-term consequences, but would probably offset your 200$ savings.</p></li>
<li><p>Deportation from Sweden. Could be together with the fine. Chapter 8, Article 1 of the Swedish <a href=""http://www.notisum.se/rnp/sls/lag/20050716.htm#K8"">Law on Foreign Nationals (in Swedish)</a> allows deportation in case something is wrong with paperwork or permits, including violations of the Schengen agreement. Section 4 of that Article also allows the same if you do not provide requested information about your stay or lie about it. That is, if you claim you'd be returning within 90 days but show a ticket 91 day later, that's also a violation. Such a deportation may or may not include a reentry ban of up to five years. A reentry ban would be reported to the Schengen Information System, see next point.</p></li>
<li><p>An entry ban in Schengen. In this case, you'd have that negative mark on your record in the Schengen information system - important to note that all Schengen countries share this. Article 24 of the <a href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32006R1987"">SIS II Regulation</a> is what allows a SIS alert banning you from entering based on the decision of an individual country (Sweden in this case). <strike>The consequences may include a requirement for you to obtain a visa prior to future visits, with you no longer being allowed visa-free 90 day travel.</strike> The previous sentence is not correct, there's no such provision in the SIS, the entry could merely require that you be denied entry. If you get a SIS alert entry, or suspect you did, it's <a href=""http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-309_en.htm"">possible to request to see your SIS entry</a>, and you could appeal the decision if you have an entry ban. A severe option, and extremely unlikely for a one-day overstay.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now, of course, another possibility is that you do not get caught or get let off with a verbal warning. Sometimes the border guards may not care to even check the dates when you're leaving. Or they may decide to let it slide, but you never know.</p>

<p>Another possibility, though unlikely, would be that border guards not only ask you about your plans on entry (likely enough in itself) but also ask to see a return ticket. Then you could run into trouble already on entry due to your ticket being on day 91.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now for a couple of practical tips. Sweden does have long-term tourist visas, but they are not an option for you if you're traveling in less than a month - the process takes much longer. Sweden's an expensive country. 200$ isn't much compared to what you will spend over the course of 3 months. I hope it's clear from the answer that the potential consequences of being caught outweigh the savings.</p>

<p>However, depending on where you are staying in Sweden (which has very good train connections), it may be worth to investigate flights from other airports. If you are in Stockholm, and especially if you're south of there, it's easy to get to Copenhagen. If you're in Gothenburg, it's possible to get to Oslo in 4 hours for as little as 46$, so it may be worth it to consider flights from nearby countries in your planning.</p>

"Larger metal objects in hand luggage","11552","","<p>I was traveling quite often by airplane within Europe carrying a larger metal object in my hand luggage, a piece of a slackline set to be more precise (approx. 1 kg, 20 cm in length). </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CCn9A.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I had no trouble at all for about 10 to 15 flights in the past year though it was always checked separately. On two recent flights I was once told I could not carry it at all (Germany) (though the policeman was so nice to let it pass ""one last time"") and once that I should rather put it in the main luggage (Spain), which I usually don't possess as it costs extra on some budget airlines.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if there are exact regulations regarding metal objects in hand luggage (size, weight, shape), especially for European countries, or if it is essentially is up to the security personnel or police to define it as a potential weapon and forbid it. What can I do to ""convince"" them that it is sport equipment rather than a dangerous metal piece?</p>
","<p>The rules regarding carry-on or hand luggage are clear enough when it comes to items that are obviously dangerous, like knives, guns, explosives or other obviously dangerous items. The problem is Civil Aviation Authorities and airlines can not make a list of all possible dangerous items because there are new items almost everyday. </p>

<p>To overcome this dilemma, Civil Aviation Authorities and airlines try to add as much as possible items to the list of prohibited items on-board and then try to add general guidelines to identify other items if they were dangerous or not. This way things depend on the interpretation of the security personnel. </p>

<p>To make a good example of this, <a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/air/security/doc/info_travellers_restricted_art.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">check this list of the prohibited items in cabin luggage in EU</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>c. <strong>objects with a sharp point or sharp edge</strong> (objects with a sharp point or sharp edge
  capable of being used to cause serious injury)<br />
  d. <strong>workmen’s tools</strong> (tools capable of being used either to cause serious injury or to threaten
  the safety of aircraft)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you check the list of the items included under each of the points above, you will not find the <em>slackline set</em> listed there, but according to the definitions above, some security personnel might interpret these definitions to consider the <em>slackline set</em> as a dangerous item because it has sharp edges and it a workmen tool that could be used to cause injury. Some other might not see it that way. </p>

<p>Bottom line, both security personnel (the one who allow it and the one who didn't) are correct, because things are left for personal interpretation. The best thing you can do is to describe to them that this is not a dangerous tool and it is used for so and so. I bet the one who didn't allow it didn't know what was this tool for, if he knew what is it for this could help a lot.</p>

","<p>The price you pay at the hotel through their ""pay later"" option will be the same price that Expedia quotes you when you make the reservation.  You will not be charged their walk in rate.</p>

<p>Chances are the verbiage ""(approx.)"" is hard coded into their html and shows on all bookings like this regardless of currency.  But it is there because exchange rates can change between now and when the hotel actually charges you and large percentage of Expedia's bookings are cross border (either hotel location or customer location).</p>

"Mixed-gender naked swimming pools in Finland","11406","","<p>I've just read about Yrjonkatu, which is a Finnish swimming pool where nudism is allowed, but only on separate days for men and women.</p>

<p>Are there any pools in Finland that allow mixed-gender nude swimming?</p>

<p>Also, the article <a href=""http://www.smh.com.au/travel/twenty-reasons-to-visit-helsinki-20140102-306y1.html"">Twenty reasons to visit Helsinki</a> claims that nude swimming is a Finnish tradition. Is it really a Finnish thing, or just a quirk of that particular swimming pool?</p>

Even the <a href=""http://www.hel.fi/hki/Liv/en/sports+facilities/swimming+halls/yrj_nkatu+swimming+hall"" rel=""noreferrer"">Yrjönkatu pool</a> is a bit of a historical quirk that has probably survived largely thanks to general conservatism (it's Finland's oldest and operated very much the way it did in 1928) and patronage from Helsinki's gay district Eerikinkatu (conveniently located right next door) &mdash; no, it's not a gay club or anything, but even heteros like me have heard that it's a bit of a cruising spot.</p>

<p>That said, nude swimming is indeed a Finnish tradition, but only in a very specific context: <strong>after a sauna</strong>!  Families and close friends commonly go to the sauna together, and since you're already naked together inside, it'd be silly and cumbersome to put on bathing suits when you go for a dip in the lake.  Also, most Finnish saunas are located in remote spots in the countryside, meaning there's nobody around to see you anyway (except possibly other nude bathers).</p>

<p>Unfortunately there are (AFAIK) no mixed gender public saunas in Finland, they're invariably either segregated into separate men's and women's sections, or they have separate shifts/days for each.  Some small local saunas (eg. apartment buildings, university dorms or small hotels) might have a <em>sekavuoro</em> (""mixed shift""), but in practice these are largely a male domain.</p>

<p>But there's one place you can get your nude on, at least in summer: the nudist beach at <a href=""http://www.hel.fi/hki/liv/en/Recreation/In+islands/Pihlajasaari"" rel=""noreferrer"">Pihlajasaari</a>, a short ferry ride from Helsinki, and one of only two in Finland that's mixed (the other is apparently in Pori).

"Where should I leave my passport and electronics if there is no safe in my apartment?","11404","","<p>I will be travelling to Barcelona soon. We are renting an apartment for a week through Booking. The apartment has no safe to keep personal belongings in. No cleaning service will enter the house during our stay.</p>

<p>I will have a backpack that I will carry around the city but I don't want to put my iPad, handheld console etc. in my backpack constantly. I think it will be more likely to get stolen in the backpack than in the apartment. Is this correct? Or would you advise to take it with us anyway?</p>

<p>And how about passports and such? I don't feel comfortable carrying it around constantly and I do have a European driver's license to use as means of identification. Would you recommend leaving it in the apartment, or taking it with me in the backpack?</p>
","<p>You seem pretty experienced at traveling already, but here's what I'd recommend:</p>

<h3>Avoid carrying stuff you can't afford to lose.</h3>

<p>Barcelona (so I've heard) is a wonderful place, I am envious. I spent 3 months traveling through Europe, but as bad luck would have it, thanks to an airline delaying my luggage, I had to skip visiting Barcelona. But also Barcelona is the #1 pickpocket capital of Europe. This shouldn't scare you though, it's much better than #1 mugging capital, but you're gonna have to stay alert, especially in crowded places.</p>

<p>There's a funny Colombian saying that goes ""<em>No des papaya!</em>"" which literally is to ""Don't offer/give out papaya (fruit)"" and it translates to ""don't make it easy for a thief, i.e carelessly flash expensive things, or do things that mark yourself as a potential target for the thief."" </p>

<p>If you must carry a day backpack, make sure it's small, or at least don't overpack it. For a day of just walking around the city, I prefer small ""gym sacks"" that have straps, and just hold stuff like an extra cell battery, cables, map, water, sun screen, etc. Leave your passport at your hotel/rental. In crowded areas carry your bag in front of you. And be wary of strangers that get too close. </p>

<p>Always carry a paper copy of your passport, and scan and upload important travel documents to the cloud. Additionally, you can even create shortened url that points to a cloud-shared item in case you need a copy of something in an emergency (i.e like for example, all my contacts are in my cell/wallet, but if my cell/wallet gets stolen, I'd go to the nearest internet cafe and browse to like <a href=""https://goo.gl/"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://goo.gl/</a> + WdcAid and get the info I need).</p>

<p>Avoid carrying so much stuff. It weighs you down, you get tired quicker, and you risk attracting more attention to yourself. Since you say you're doing a short-term rental, and no one is supposed to go in to clean the apartment while you're there, you can leave electronics you don't need there. </p>

<h3>In a hostel or hotel or temporary housing, be creative and hide your stuff in plain sight</h3>

<p>I think you have a pretty safe place for your things. If you want to be extra safe (or paranoid like me), hide your money or important things in unexpected places, or hide them in plain sight.</p>

<p>For example, I've always used an empty deodorant stick container, and roll up most of my cash I travel with ($500-600 max) inside it and place it among my other toiletries in the bathroom (if not shared of course). No burglar is going to look through there. You can use a ziplock bag and put your passport or other important documents in the refrigerator for example. Just don't forget where you're hiding your stuff!</p>

<h3>Safety in and out</h3>

<p>Please be safe when abroad. Don't drink too much, or do anything you wouldn't normally do at home. Be aware of your surroundings and overtly friendly strangers at bars, etc. I like to also implement some of the hotel security tips from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0GGHIjShh4"" rel=""noreferrer"">these guys</a> to make sure my room is safe. It might be overkill, but it never hurts. When out and about, make sure you've planned your route or know more or less how to get there, that way taxi drivers don't rip you off, and you don't look like a helpless tourist holding a map upside down. The site <a href=""https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Barcelona"" rel=""noreferrer"">WikiVoyage.org</a> is an amazing resource of info on just about everything you need to know. And they have an offline mobile app, you can preload using wifi.</p>

"What are the rates posted on hotel room doors / in the lobby for?","11395","","<p>When I'm travelling, I often see hotel room rates posted on the back of the hotel room door (typically in the US) or in the lobby, behind the check-in desk. These rates are typically eye-wateringly high - $/£/€100s above what you would pay even for a fully flexible regular ""rack rate"" on the hotel's website, and probably more even than you would be charged if you walked off the street and asked for a room (although I rarely do that!).</p>

<p>What are these rates for? I assume they must be a legal requirement of some sort; perhaps they are a legal maximum?</p>
","<p>California, USA is one place where you see these posted rates.</p>

<p>I believe this is to comply with <a href=""http://law.onecle.com/california/civil/1863.html"">Civil Code Section 1863</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) Every keeper of a hotel, inn, boardinghouse or
  lodginghouse, shall post in a conspicuous place in the office or
  public room, and in every bedroom of said hotel, boardinghouse, inn,
  or lodginghouse, a printed copy of this section, and a statement of
  rate or range of rates by the day for lodging.</p>
  
  <p>(b) No charge or sum shall be collected or received for any
  greater sum than is specified in subdivision (a). For any violation
  of this subdivision, the offender shall forfeit to the injured party
  one hundred dollars ($100) or three times the amount of the sum
  charged in excess of what he is entitled to, whichever is greater.
  There shall be no forfeiture under this subdivision unless notice be
  given of the overcharge to such keeper within 30 days after payment
  of such charges and such keeper shall fail or refuse to make proper
  adjustment of such overcharge.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I assume the intention was to prevent things like price gouging for distressed travelers, special events, or customers the management sees as undesirable (e.g. racism).  However, as you point out, hotels often set this rate very high, so that they can charge high rates when they want, and claim everyone else is getting a discount.   </p>

<p>Given this, I'm not sure why they stop at prices that are 3-5 times the actual rates; why not post a rate of a million dollars per night, and have complete freedom?  There may be some additional regulations that I don't know about.</p>

"Immigration officer stamped ""Indefinite leave to enter UK"" in US passport of EU citizen. How to fix it?","11336","","<p>At Heathrow <strong>yesterday</strong>, a US-Swedish dual citizen presented his US passport to immigration, as he had forgotten his Swedish one at home.</p>

<p>He went in the non-EEA queue and was initially interviewed like a non-EEA national, but the officer then asked if he held any other nationality, whereby he said he was also Swedish but had forgotten his Swedish passport at home.</p>

<p>The officer asked if he had any evidence of his Swedish nationality, whereby he found (in his bag) his English-language signed and stamped birth certificate from Sweden, which doesn't contain a photograph, but states his nationality as Swedish.</p>

<p>Apparently this satisfied the officer, whereby he stamped his US passport, with the leave stamp saying ""<em>Given indefinite leave to enter the United Kingdom</em>"" (<strong>example</strong> below):</p>

<p>That's why I wonder: was this the correct procedure for handling an EEA national without an EEA passport?</p>

<p>If not, what specifically should the person have been given instead? And in the unlikely event of a police or immigration enforcement inspection, would he be OK with what he's got?</p>

<p>Note: picture is an <strong>example</strong> of what the stamp the traveller got looks like. This happened on 1 feb 2017, and he will now be in the UK for 4 weeks.</p>

After a brief landing interview, the IO issued <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/settle-in-the-uk"" rel=""noreferrer"">Indefinite Leave to Remain</a> along with a handwritten note that the holder was a dual national.</p>

<p>This was a mistake on the IO's part. Sometimes this happens; I have seen it personally about twice, once in London and once in Moscow that affected about 200 people.  There were also two cases of corruption: a case where an IO was selling ILR stamps at Heathrow because she was in debt; and another IO in Dover also female with the same personal issues. Corruption does not apply in this case <em>allegedly</em>. </p>

<p>ILR gives the holder immediate access to public housing and free NHS treatment plus all the other trappings of the welfare state. It's a serious mistake, although it's not the person's fault it still needs to be fixed.</p>

<p>It's incorrect because his US passport is buggered up with an erroneous document that opens the door for further abuse. Plus a passport <strong>should never admit to multiple nationalities</strong> without the holder's consent. Think about it. He will have to answer questions about it every time they see it.

And while he is ok from a freedom of movement perspective, he has no claim for permanent residence in the UK. EU nationals acquire permanent residence through a different rigmarole.

It's a procedure (they will investigate and probably put stop flags on the others the IO admitted).  They will not fix it from land side for lots of reasons outside of scope here. </p>

<p>So what I pay for transporting 95&nbsp;kg could cost more than the person transporting 140&nbsp;kg.</p>

<p>Is there an airline that has a fairer policy and charges more appropriately based on actual mass transported?</p>
","<p>Short answer: <strong>No, you will not get such a discount.</strong></p>

<p>Longer answer:  </p>

<p>For any significantly-sized airliner, the commodity they have to sell you is floor space in the cabin, not weight. If you're occupying one seat of the same size, you're costing the airline almost exactly the same as someone who weighs twice what you do.</p>

<p>Let's consider some numbers:</p>

<p>Assumed average weight of a passenger: 150 lb (68 kg).<br>
<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A330#Specifications"">Operating Empty Weight of an A330-300</a>: 274,500 lb (124,500 kg).<br>
Weight of the <a href=""https://www.delta.com/content/www/en_US/traveling-with-us/airports-and-aircraft/Aircraft/airbus-a330-200-3l3.html"">293 passengers on a Delta A333</a>: 150 x 293 = 43,950 lb (19,940 kg).<br>
Example fuel load on an A333: 150,000 lb (68,000 kg).  (It can carry <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A330#Specifications"">up to 175,170 lb.</a> (79,460 kg) of Jet-A)<br>
Total before cargo for our fully-loaded A333: <strong>468,450 lb (212,490 kg).</strong></p>

<p>Now let's say we double everyone's weight. <strong>Adding another 43,950 lb (19,940 kg) adds another 9% to the gross takeoff weight for our A333 full of 300 lb (136 kg) passengers.</strong></p>

<p>Also, one must consider that fuel is a major operating cost for airlines, but far from the only one. The other costs for operating your flight include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cost of paying the flight crew.</li>
<li>Cost of paying the cabin crew.</li>
<li>Cost of paying the ground crew (baggage handlers, maintenance, wing walkers, etc.)</li>
<li>Cost of paying the check-in agents, gate agents, and other customer service personnel.</li>
<li>Cost of paying all of the administrative staff back at corporate (marketing, executive staff, IT staff, logistics planners, weather forecasters, dispatchers, etc.)</li>
<li>Amortization of that <a href=""http://www.airbus.com/presscentre/pressreleases/press-release-detail/detail/new-airbus-aircraft-list-prices-for-2014/"">$246 million A330-300</a>.</li>
<li>Maintenance of said $246 million aircraft (parts, hangars, ferry flights, etc.)</li>
<li>Airport fees (landing fees, gate fees, hangar rental, check-in desk rental, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these costs add up so much that fuel costs <a href=""http://www.aviationdb.com/Aviation/FuelExpenseByCarrier.shtm"">represented only 27% of costs for Delta</a> in the most recent quarter and they were on the high end.</p>

<p><strong>So, our A330-300 full of 300 lb (136 kg) passengers would only increase airline costs by around 9.38% x 0.27 = about 2.5%.</strong></p>

<p>Conclusion: Your below-average weight is decreasing airline costs from those of flying an average 150 lb (68 kg) passenger by probably a fraction of a percent. This is certainly not worthwhile for the airline to create such a small discount, especially not considering the business they'd likely lose over people not wanting to be weighed and/or feeling discriminated against and/or feeling that their privacy is being violated.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Baggage</h3>

<p>In addition to the title question of whether you can get a discount for weighing less, baggage was also mentioned. The situation is a little different with baggage and actually varies depending on the type of baggage.</p>

<p>What you're paying for when you buy a ticket is:</p>

<ul>
<li>A certain amount of floor space in the passenger cabin (namely, the amount your seat occupies,)</li>
<li>A certain amount of carry-on baggage, and</li>
<li>A certain amount of checked baggage.</li>
</ul>

<p>The reasons for this are:</p>

<h3>Carry-On Baggage</h3>

<p>With carry-on baggage, you're again paying more for space than for weight. There's only so much volume available for carry-on baggage in the passenger cabin, so there are limits to how much any one person can bring so that, hopefully, everyone can get theirs in. No U.S. airline I've flown on has ever even bothered to weigh carry-on baggage. They only care that you have no more than the allowed two pieces (namely, one that will fit in the overhead bin and one that will fit under the seat in front of you.)</p>

<p>Some non-U.S. airlines I've flown on have weighed carry-on baggage, but only for safety purposes (i.e. to make sure it didn't exceed the weight capacity of the overhead bin.) In those cases, overweight bags didn't have an extra fee, but were rather banned outright, since it was a safety concern, not a cost concern.</p>

<h3>Checked Baggage</h3>

<p>With checked baggage, the situation is a little different. As densely-packed as passenger cabins may feel these days, the reality is that they're mostly filled with air. That's not necessarily the case with the cargo hold where checked baggage goes. It still has volume limits, but its weight limits also become significant, since the cargo is packed much more densely than the passenger cabin. </p>

<p>With cargo, in addition to the volume limits, there are multiple weight limits at play:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Maximum Takeoff Weight (MTOW) of the aircraft. For this, all weight on board does matter.</li>
<li>The weight limit of the particular cargo deck itself. For this, only cargo weight matters.</li>
<li>The weight limit that any one baggage handler is required to lift by himself. For this, only the weight of <em>your one particular bag</em> matters.</li>
</ul>

<p>In practice, the last of those ends up being the reason for overweight bag fees. If your bag weighs more than an individual handler is required to lift by himself, they'll need multiple handlers and/or special equipment <em>every single time they handle your bag</em>, which can be quite a lot of times. It's for this reason that you'll be charged an extra fee for carrying one 55 lb. (25 kg) bag, but not for two 50 lb. (22.7 kg) bags.</p>

<p>Of course, as long as the bags are all under the maximum a handler is required to lift, more bags means more cost to the airline (it takes them 5 times as long to load five 10 lb. bags as one 50 lb. bag, for example.)</p>

<p>So, for checked baggage, you're usually limited both to a certain number of pieces and with a weight limit on each piece individually, rather than just a total baggage weight limit. How much you personally weigh is completely irrelevant to the airline's expenses for transporting your baggage. And, of course, again, this is in addition to the fact that the airline would lose revenue from passengers who didn't want to provide their weight, even if it otherwise would make sense for them to consider passenger weight in fares.</p>

"Is liability insurance required in order to rent a car?","11329","","<p>I do not own my car, and thus do not have auto insurance of my own (otherwise, auto insurance typically follows you where you go, including to any rental cars). When I went to rent a car, I was told that I was required by the State of Georgia to have my own liability insurance, and that since I did not have my own auto insurance, I would have to purchase the rental company's supplemental liability insurance (SLP). Is this true? Wouldn't the rental car company already have coverage for the state-mandated minimum liability insurance?</p>
","<p>This liability insurance issue depends on every country. As for the US in particular, every state may have a different policy. It is indeed required in many states to have liability insurance. In most states where liability insurance is required, the rental car company will provide a minimum coverage. But be careful, as stated in <a href=""http://www.hertz.com/rentacar/productservice/index.jsp?targetPage=USHowProtectedAreYou.jsp#How_to_file_an_LIS_claim"" rel=""noreferrer"">Hertz policy</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Financial Responsibility Limits by State</strong></p>
  
  <p>The following chart lists the Automobile Financial Responsibility Limits of the various states. Hertz is not required to provide such minimum protection in all states. However, the purchase of LIS will include primary protection which combines these minimum limits of protection with an excess insurance policy to provide the first $1,000,000 of combined bodily injury and/or property damage for each occurrence.</p>
  
  <p>Georgia : 25/50/25 (Per Person Bodily Injury/All Persons Bodily Injury/All Property Damage (in thousands of dollars))</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hertz clearly says the liability is not always provided. They add:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At many Hertz locations, you receive secondary liability protection, and, in a few locations, no liability protection under the terms of the Rental Agreement from claims of injury by others against you resulting from an accident with your rental car. Some locations provide primary protection under the Rental Agreement. However, in those situations where protection is provided by Hertz, such protection is generally no more than the minimum limits required by individual state law. (See chart for these Financial Responsibility Limits.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, clearly, it depends on every rental location. Avis, <a href=""http://www.avis.com/car-rental/content/render-faq.ac"" rel=""noreferrer"">in its FAQ</a> (Protections/Coverages>Automobile liability ...) is clearer on which states are concerned: there is no provided coverage for California, Texas and Utah. In Missouri, the state's minimum coverage is provided if the customer has no coverage on its own.</p>

<p>From the name (SLP) of the suggested liability insurance option, it is possible your rental company is <a href=""https://enterprise.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3072/session/L3RpbWUvMTM3NzY3ODIzMi9zaWQvejM4RFFUeWw%3D"" rel=""noreferrer"">Enterprise</a>. Even if not clear, the words they use suggest they do NOT provide any liability insurance at all without SLP:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the renter accepts SLP, Enterprise provides third party liability protection up to the applicable minimum financial responsibility limit.</p>
  
  <p>the renter should examine his or her personal insurance policies or other sources of coverage that may duplicate the coverage provided by SLP.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I would recommend you to read the fine prints of your rental car company to figure what its policy is exactly regarding Georgia, to know if you need to suscribe a liability insurance option or not.</p>

I'm german and will travel to Seattle by plane and after a one night stay take the bus to Vancouver. As booking bus tickets in advance is much cheaper, I would like to purchase the ticket online in advance. I have the option to purchase a <em>Print at Home</em> ticket or <em>Will Call</em> ticket, but both of these options require me to enter an American-style telephone number which I do not have. </p>

","<p>My experience in the USA is that you can usually collect a car early, but there is no guarantee of this - if you want to be sure best call. It's also worth pointing out that your hire will start from when you collect the car, even if this is before the time you booked. So a car collected at 10am is due back at 10am.</p>

<p>They are very strict about late returns. Most commonly a 30 minute grace period is provided, and returns after that are charged the extra day. With some companies it is possible to extend a booking at an hourly rate for some hours (most commonly up to 2) but if you don't call up and extend ahead of the return time, you will be charged the extra day.</p>

"Slightly illicit: felon traveling on a US passport; will I be refused entry to the UK?","11276","","<p>I was convicted of a felony in the US, and my conviction will not be considered ""spent"" as of the period in which I intend to travel to the UK. I understand if I were to apply for a standard visa I would be summarily denied. However, if I were to simply go there, would I be denied entry on arrival if I were not to volunteer this fact?</p>

<p>Basically, the question is, could I sneak one by them? <em>One</em> being, namely, myself. I have to use up some frequent flyer miles, and I'd decided on going to the UK before this matter of actually being able to go there came to mind. I've no doubt I'll be able to stay out of trouble while in the country, were I given the opportunity.</p>

<p>It would be nice to know if someone in a similar situation had a result, whether it be positive or negative, in that regard. Lacking that, I would gladly hear any wisdom from knowledgeable but less involved parties.</p>

<p>Edit for clarification:<br>
I was imprisoned for 3.5 years for a violent offense. There are no restrictions on my passport. I'm primarily concerned with whether or not there are communications between the relevant agencies in the US and the UK as there are between those in the US and Canada and, recently, the US and Mexico, regarding the movement of convicted criminals between these countries, as the answer would save me certain deportation if that were the case.</p>
","<p><strong>I'm primarily concerned with whether or not there are communications between the relevant agencies in the US and the UK</strong></p>

<p>Source:  <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/282580/8790.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the United States of America for
the Sharing of Visa, Immigration, and Nationality Information</a> </p>

<p>So the answer is yes, the two governments share information, not only by this treaty (and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">similar ones</a>), but also by terms implicit in the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Relationship"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Special Relationship</a>.</p>

<p>But just because there's an infrastructure in place for sharing information does not necessary mean that <em>you personally</em> have been included in the database, they might think that you are a 'small fry' and not worth worrying about.  Their priorities are to inform each other about capital crimes or an act of terrorism, and you may not meet the reporting threshold.  3 1/2 years custody is not that bad as far as felons go.  On the other hand, if you are in the database, you will not be allowed to board in the US, so no problem.</p>

<p>Also, a felony in one country does not mean that the UK will treat it the same way.  The classic example is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buggery_Act_1533"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">buggery</a>, which carries the death penalty in some places but the UK has decriminalised it and now doesn't care about it.</p>

<p><strong>Basically, the question is, could I sneak one by them?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, it is possible.  I am tracking a case now where a felon from the US entered the UK and overstayed for two years and is now due for an enforcement action.  Although that person's criminal history had been spent when he entered the UK, he will be detained and removed as an illegal entrant/overstayer (unless they decide his human rights would be violated) as part of an inland sweep.  As far as computers and databases at the port go, the odds are more in your favour than not.</p>

<p>All of this does not necessarily mean you are good to go and it would be a mistake to leave you with that impression.  A mind-boggling 73% of enforcement actions are initiated by intelligence received from anonymous sources.  The bulk of these are inland operations, but astonishingly includes <a href=""http://icinspector.independent.gov.uk/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tip offs coming in from overseas</a> before the person even arrives. </p>

<p>Also, when you arrive at the airport you will join a queue waiting for your landing interview.  While in the queue, you will be observed for various triggers like flushed face, fidgeting, palpitations, stressed behaviour, and other signs that you may be trying to pull a fast one.  So by the time you reach the front of the queue you may already be pegged as suspicious  <em>before you even talk to the IO</em>.  And finally, if the IO's stop indicator is checked, you can expect a very brief intermezzo in merry olde England.</p>

<p>Having said all of that, it is a crime to enter the UK without disclosure of material facts, even if they do not ask (deception by silence is an immigration offense).  And if you have an unspent criminal history, it's a further criminal act not to disclose it.  They may want to get you on that before tipping their hand just for icing on the cake.</p>

<p><strong>as the answer would save me certain deportation if that were the case.</strong></p>

<p>No. The UK would not deport you, there have only been about three deportations all year so far.  Instead, they would remove you as an illegal entrant. There are thousands of these all the time. </p>

<hr>

<p>I saw that your question is prompted by using up your air miles.  If they decide to remove you, the airline has the option of depleting your air miles to help defray the cost of your return flight (even if you have a ticket).  I have seen it happen and people tend to get very indignant about it (ironically, more so than the removal).  But since you won't be flying with them again anyway, it's probably irrelevant.  </p>

<p>Be careful when changing money as there are some scams.  For example, when I was there a few weeks ago the exchange rate was around 2.44 Lira to the US$, however one money changer I noticed was offering 2.244, presumably hoping people wouldn't notice the difference...</p>

"3 days in London. What do I absolutely have to see?","11103","","<p>In a few weeks I will be in London for the first time for 3 days to take care of some business. I thought I could take advantage of the situation and do some sightseeing.</p>

<p>What are the places I must absolutely visit? So far I got the Big Ben and Westminster Abbey. Also, what are some good places to go out and have some fun in the night?</p>

<p>EDIT: Thank you all for your responses. London is a wonderful place, and your answers allowed me to have a very good time there.</p>

<p>One thing I haven't seen mentioned, if you are looking for pubs go to Clapham Common. Had a blast there.</p>
","<p>Each person has their own taste, so this questions is almost subjective.  However, after living there for four years, I now know there are certain things that EVERY tourist seems to want to do or see.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>St Paul's.  It's one of the greatest cathedrals in Europe, and I've heard people say it's their European highlight, the pinnacle of sights that they've seen.  On a Sunday you can get in free, although you won't have access to everywhere inside.</p></li>
<li><p>Westminster Abbey and a photograph of Big Ben.  When you come out of Westminster tube station, it's tourists EVERYWHERE.  But I suggest coming out at Waterloo station and walking across the bridge to Big Ben - you'll get a better photograph.  Westminster Abbey is just behind it, and like St Paul's, some of it is free to access on Sunday's.  Note that only residents can go up Big Ben, and even they have to apply to their local Member of Parliament months in advance for a tour.</p></li>
<li><p>Tower of London.  My favourite tourist attraction.  I spent the better part of a day here, and could easily go back for more.  Get there early to beat the crowds.  Right next to it is Tower Bridge - which most people think is called London Bridge.  London Bridge is actually flat and boring ;)</p></li>
<li><p>The London Eye.  Giant ferris wheel next to Waterloo station, the queues are insane on weekends.  This is a polarising attraction - people either think it's a waste of money, or a must-see.  I've been twice - during day and night, and loved it.</p></li>
<li><p>The museums.  British Museum, Imperial War Museum, Natural History Museum and Science Museum are the big famous ones, but there are smaller ones too if you search around.  The best part is that most of them (including all the big ones I've just mentioned) are free!</p></li>
<li><p>The London Underground.  It sounds odd, but it's such a fundamental part of London, that you need to make sure you ride it a few times on different lines.  Perhaps in from Heathrow, or to the museums, as it's nice to walk around above ground in central London, and it's surprising how close together everything is.</p></li>
<li><p>Picadilly Circus and Oxford Circus.  Walk through, take photo, move on.  They're famous, historic, but they only take a few minutes ;)</p></li>
<li><p>Buckingham Palace.  You can't always go inside, and most people claim the changing of the guard is over-rated, but there's still something about seeing it!</p></li>
<li><p>The parks.  Make sure to check out at least St James Park, and Hyde Park.</p></li>
<li><p>London Zoo and Camden Market.  They're close by. Come out of Camden tube station nice and early, check out the market for a bit.  Then walk to the zoo - it's historic, and has quite a few animals you don't see many of.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Bonus sights!</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Richmond Park - my favourite park in all of London.  Take the tube or overland to Richmond, and ask someone for directions from there. It's about a 20 min walk to get there, and then you're in the largest open air space in all of Greater London, with two large herds of deer, and a protected view all the way back to St Paul's, the Gherkin and the London Eye.  Fantastic place on a clear day, or when there's fresh snow on the ground :)</p></li>
<li><p>Borough Market and Southbank - close to London Bridge, and open from Thursday to Saturday, the fresh food and coffee is a great start to your morning, before you walk along Southbank to Tower Bridge, or west to Waterloo.  London Bridge station, Borough Market exit, west side of Borough High street.</p></li>

"How do hotel cancellation, prepayment and currency changes combine?","11090","","<p>I was looking on <a href=""http://booking.com"">booking.com</a> to book some hotels for our trip next year. Quite a few deals have free cancellation until 1 day before arrival, which is always useful. However most of them also have a prepayment of 100% of the first night or even the complete booking ""on the day of booking"". So if I book now, the price for a full night will be charged on my credit card <strong>today</strong> (or at least this week)?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>Cancellation:</b>   If cancelled or modified up to 1 day
  before the date of arrival,  no fee will be charged.   If cancelled or modified later or in case
  of no-show, 100 percent of the first night will be charged. 
  </p> <p> <b>Prepayment:</b> 100 percent of the first night will be
  charged on the day of booking. </p></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I cancel in time, how sure can I be that I get everything back? Next to that, I'm booking the rooms in USD, but my card and account are in EUR. My bank charges 1,5% fee to change between currencies. When I get my refund, this will be again charged a 1,5% fee? (Not taking into account that the exchange rate between 2 currencies also change over time).</p>
","<p>You will get everything back if this is a trusted dealer and your cancellation gets through; booking.com is quite trusted! You also get protection through EU legislation if there is a problem with your provider and you paid with your credit or debit card.</p>

<p>If you are in the EU, from my experience, the transaction will be rolled back at the same USD amount (as you were charged in USD) and the bank's changing fee for the payment will be lost but you will NOT lose/win depending on the rate change (it will keep the same one). You won't pay a changing fee for the refund, as you get credited – changing fees only apply to debits.</p>

<p>It seems that it is because they are rolling back the original transaction you made instead of refunding through a new transaction: this is why you don't need to enter your card information again for a refund in this case.</p>

<p>For comparison, if you do the same process e.g. for airline tickets you bought in the ""physical"" world and they can't figure or use the transaction number you had, you will have to enter your card and type your PIN again, and you will face the rate changes. That's why you may cancel an airline ticket anywhere in the world, but the refund you may be entitled to should be done if possible in your home country / currency, even if the ticket was bought outside of your country, for you to avoid losing a few percent of the amount (quite big sums already on long flights), even after return if your fare allows (you mostly have from a few months to a few years to do it at home after you cancelled).</p>

"Can I visit Chicago during a 5.5 hour layover in O'Hare?","11071","","<p>I will be flying from Boston to Tokyo with a 5.5 hour morning layover in Chicago. I'm thinking of going out to the city for some late breakfast and/or sightseeing. I've never left an airport during a layover before, so I have some questions.</p>

<p>I'll land in Chicago at 8am, and take off at 1:30pm.</p>

<ul>
<li>I imagine I'll leave the airport by 9, and should be back by 11:30. Is this reasonable?</li>
<li>What's the best way to deal with luggage? I assume that I'll have to claim the luggage from the domestic flight, then re-check it for the international flight. Can I leave the airport after re-checking it? If not, are there any luggage storage options, other than <a href=""http://airportczar.com/ohare/about/lockers"">Manuel</a> (lol)?</li>
<li>How much is a taxi to downtown Chicago?</li>
<li>As an alternative to downtown, is there anything (food/sights) you can you recommend that's closer to the airport?</li>
</ul>
","<p>Assuming you arrive in the domestic terminal and leave from the international one, I would first go over there and try to check in early, just to get that out of the way.</p>

<p>It is always risky to leave the airport and get into suburban traffic when you have to catch another flight, especially an international one.</p>

<p>Your time is limited and I wouldn't spend too much of it in downtown. However even getting there is interesting enough. I would suggest just taking the <a href=""http://www.transitchicago.com/blueline/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Blue line</a> from O'Hare to Clark/Lake (1h), then go up and change into the <a href=""http://www.transitchicago.com/pinkline/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Pink line</a>, this is an elevated train 'The L' that goes around the loop, so you have some views over downtown Chicago. Get off at Washington/Wells and walk back to Clark/Lake (5 blocks) to get back on the Blue line to O'Hare (1h). With only 2.5 hours to spend, this is a very tight schedule. </p>

<p>Photo credit: <a href=""http://peter.hahndorf.eu"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Peter Hahndorf</a></p>

<p>To make things worse, the Blue line leaves from near terminal 2, to get there to/from terminal 5 takes at least 15 minutes each.</p>

<p>I would only try this, if you had checked in already, so that when getting back to the airport you would only need to go through security and to the gate, meaning you don't have to be back at 11:30 but maybe at 12:00 or even 12:30.</p>

<p>It would be easier if you could check in through to Tokyo in Boston and don't have to worry about luggage and checkin in O'Hare.</p>

<p>You could also not go downtown, but just look around one of the West Side neighborhoods for a short while. Just take the Blue line to Belmont or Logan Square, spend some time there and then go back. There is nothing too special there, but you can get a feel for Chicago outside of the loop.</p>

"Do I break the law as a foreigner in Germany if an embassy keeps my passport to stick a visa in?","11062","","<p>An Armenian national lives in Germany and holds a permanent residence (<a href=""https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niederlassungserlaubnis"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>Niederlassungserlaubnis</em></a>). This is a sticker in their Armenian passport. They have applied at the UK embassy in Berlin to get a standard visitor visa, which will likely be granted. The UK embassy kept their passport and said issuing and sticking the visa into the passport will take five days. After those five days, they will be able to reclaim their passport.</p>

<p>However, German residence act (<em>Aufenthaltsgesetz</em>) § 3 says that as a foreigner you have to have a passport with you (<a href=""https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_aufenthg/englisch_aufenthg.html#p0051"" rel=""noreferrer"">English source</a>, <a href=""https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/aufenthg_2004/__3.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">German source</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) Foreigners may only enter or stay in the federal territory if they are in possession of a recognised and valid passport or passport substitute, unless they are exempt from the passport obligation by virtue of a statutory instrument. For the purpose of residence in the federal territory, possession of a substitute identity document shall also suffice in order to meet the passport obligation (Section 48 (2)).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Section 48 says they have to give that document to the German authorities if they need it, i.e. for a control.</p>

<p>Also when asked, the Berlin foreigners office (<em>Auslaenderbehoerde</em>) says as the holder of a residence permit you should carry your passport around at all times.</p>

<p>So within those five days, they have a passport and a valid visa for Germany, but they cannot carry it around with them as it's with the UK embassy. </p>

<p>How do they fulfill the obligation to have their passport with them all the time? Are they breaking the law?</p>
","<p>I asked the <em>Bundespolizei</em> <a href=""https://twitter.com/simbabque/status/874589741261443072"" rel=""noreferrer"">on Twitter</a>. This is their reply.</p>

<p>AZR stands for <a href=""https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ausl%C3%A4nderzentralregister"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>Ausländerzentralregister</em></a>, which is the federal German database of everyone who has a permanent residence or some other form of long-stay visa or asylum. </p>

<p>As a part of their visit, the person wants to do volunteer work in the community. They will not get paid, but their lunch is provided as a courtesy. Is it OK for the visitor to do volunteer work in this context?  </p>
","<h1>State of Play  23 Feb 2015</h1>

<p>The Home Office has prepared a set of substantially revised visitor rules which will be laid before Parliament this Thursday (26 Feb 2015). The new rules, along with the new guidance, will answer questions like yours with much more clarity and resolution than the current rules/guidance. The rules will be unveiled on the Hansard site this Friday (27 Feb 2015) and activate in April. The Home Office site will be updated during March.</p>

<p>Part of the new rules will be introducing volunteer work as a permitted activity for visitors (tourists).  Specifically...</p>

<p><strong>Rule</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>incidental volunteering for up to 30 days at a registered UK charity;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Interpretation</strong></p>

<p>""Incidental"" is used here to mean the volunteering is not the main purpose of the visit.  If the main purpose of your visit is to do volunteer work, you will not qualify.  </p>

<p>""registered UK charity"" means an organisation listed on the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/charity-commission"">UK Charity Register</a>.  <a href=""http://www.oxfam.org.uk/"">Oxfam</a>, for example, is listed on the register, so a visitor can do up to 30 days volunteer work at Oxfam so long as the volunteering is incidental to the person's visit.</p>

<p>Another example is the <a href=""https://www.wwoof.org.uk/"">World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms</a> (WWOOF). Their entry in the Charity Register is <a href=""http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithoutPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1126220&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0"">here</a>. </p>

<p>The Charity Register has a search function that enables users to determine if a given organisation has a listing or not.  If you cannot find an organisation's registration entry, it means they do not qualify.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Although volunteer work will be permitted, a visitor will not be able to serve as a director or trustee because these roles occur in other legislation.</p>

<p><strong>ALSO NOTE</strong>: The new rules will activate in April 2015, you cannot benefit from them until that time.</p>

<p><strong>ALSO NOTE</strong>: As always, it takes a long time for everyone to learn about new rules (including Immigration Officers), so it's recommended to print out the relevant text (when it is published on the Home Office site) and carry it with you.  The rules will be posted at <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/immigration-rules"">Immigration Rules</a> in April 2015.  Guidance will be posted on the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/immigration-operational-guidance/immigration-directorate-instructions"">IDI</a> site.  </p>

<p><strong>ALSO NOTE</strong>: A listing on the Charity Register is not necessarily a permanent thing. If the organisation loses it's registration, you will have to stop volunteering there or face possible sanctions.</p>

<p>There are additional changes affecting visitors, but these are mostly about business visitors.  Finally, the UK legal community was advised about these changes two weeks ago by a letter sent from the Home Office's policy unit; they should be ready by now to give advice if you need it.</p>

<h1>Adding 26 Feb 2015</h1>

<p>As laid before Parliament earlier today, the new rules are <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/statement-of-changes-to-the-immigration-rules-hc1025-26-february-2015"">here</a>.  The relevant text for this law is...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A visitor may undertake incidental volunteering, provided it lasts no
  more than 30 days in total and is for a charity that is registered
  with either the Charity Commission for England and Wales; the Charity
  Commission for Northern Ireland; or the Office of the Scottish Charity
  Regulator.</p>

<p>Are airlines allowed to make flights leave sooner? If someone misses their flight because of this, do they have to be compensated by the airline?</p>
","<p>Airlines will bump up a departure time if they feel they can get the plane out earlier.  It helps their on-time performance stats and gets everyone to their destination a little earlier.</p>

<p>But this is done only when they are certain everyone will be onboard earlier.  The decision would likely be based on 1) all originating passengers have checked in XX minutes before the flight 2) all flights with connecting passengers have arrived at the airport XX minutes before the flight 3) the aircraft is at the gate cleaned and fueled before the new boarding time commences.</p>

<p>In addition the airline needs to get clearance from Air Traffic Control for an earlier pushback, departure and arrival slot.</p>

<p>So it is not something they do on a whim and wouldn't be done if there was risk of leaving passengers behind.</p>

<p>There's no special dress code: you don't need to dress as a traditional Bavarian—that's just something some people do for extra fun. Normal jeans and tee-shirt will be fine.</p>

But certainly there is no reason why you cannot attend and enjoy.</p>

"What's the best way to get sleep on a train in a sitting compartment?","10975","","<p>In late December this year I'll be travelling on an overnight train in Russia. Unfortunately all of the tickets have already sold out for that particular train, with the exception of the sitting compartment.</p>

<p>What's the best way to get some sleep in these conditions?</p>
","<h2>Get a Window Seat</h2>

<p>When I reserve a seat on train (or a plane, for that matter), knowing that I would like to sleep during the journey, I often <strong>book a window seat</strong>. That way I can lean my head on the window, rather than having it hanging in the void, causing me to wake up every ten minutes as soon as the neck ache kicks in. Moreover I place a jumper/t-shirt/soft-layer between my head and the window. This layer acts as a pillow and temperature insulator.</p>

<p>As the comments below suggest, the windows seat is also strategically placed so that you will not be woken up when your neighbour needs to go to the bathroom. However, you can always climb on top of the seat, or find another acrobatic way out, in case you are the one who needs to go to the bathroom. From my point of view it is better to be the one climbing over rather than to be climbed over.</p>

<h2>Pack for Sleeping</h2>

<p>If you want to sleep, <strong>bring sleeping gear</strong>. Since you are travelling by train, you don't have to abide by weight rules for your carry-on. So you can pack as much gear as you like. For me, necessary can't-sleep-without-it gear includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sleeping mask</li>
<li>Ear plugs</li>
<li>Travel pillow</li>
<li>Some form of cover: blanket, jacket, sleeping bag</li>
</ul>

<h2>Anticipate Pickpockets</h2>

<p>As others have mentioned in the comments: sleeping on a long-haul night train makes you a target for pickpockets/thieves, especially if you don't have the extra safety of being inside a private/locked compartment. To be fair there is not much you can do to make yourself, and your stuff, completely 100% thieve-proof. More so if you are sleeping in an unlocked, unsupervised space. What you can do however is make sound assumptions on thieve behaviour and plan ahead. Your objective should be to <strong>make your stuff less appealing for thieves because it requires more effort on their part to take it</strong>. </p>

<p><a href=""https://www.ricksteves.com/travel-tips/theft-scams/outsmarting-pickpockets"">Here</a> and <a href=""http://www.artoftravel.com/08thieves.htm"">here</a> are some general pickpocket-prenvention tips. <a href=""http://www.reidsitaly.com/planning/get_around/train_safety.html"">Here is some advice on sleeping in couchettes on Italian trains.</a> Below is a summary of what I think are the most relevant points for the purpose of sleeping in a train:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Keep your money/documents/phone/valuables on you</strong>, either in your pockets or in dedicated supports (for example money belts). Clothes and other less-valuable items can go in your rucksack/suitcase.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have a small backpack/laptop bag, strap/clip/tie it to some fixed support. This can be either your leg, the seat itself, the table between seats, etc. The point is that anchoring the bag to a fixed support makes it harder to be snatched away.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, you can also strap/clip/tie your rucksack/suitcase to, for example, the luggage rack. Once again this makes it harder to snatch.</p></li>
<li><p>Lock the zippers on all your bags with padlocks/zip-ties/key-ring/paper-clips. This will obviously make the bag harder to get into.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure that the topmost item in your backpack/rucksack/suitcase is something that a thief would have no interest in taking. My personal favourite are dirty underwear and socks, kept in a plastic bag with its opening towards the opening of the backpack. This way its content is the fist thing a potential thief would see, when accessing the bag. I always laugh when picturing what their face would look like.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Final Remarks</h2>

<p>Having said this, note that I somewhat agree with <a href=""https://www.ricksteves.com/travel-tips/transportation/trains/night-trains"">this guy</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you’re determined to avoid paying for a couchette, [and fail to find anything else but a standard (non-foldout) seat] book a couchette — what you’ll spend is less than what you’d waste by arriving at your next destination too fatigued to enjoy it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is especially true in case of long-haul train journeys such as the one you mention. Moreover, couchette compartments can be locked from the inside adding an extra level of safety for you and your belongings.</p>

"Do any banks in USA offer tourists a checking account with debit card?","10946","","<p>I not a US citizen and don't have a Social Security Number but will be traveling to the US for three months, bringing cash.</p>

<p>Do any banks offer tourists a checking account with debit card, so I can deposit my cash and not have to pay in cash all the time?</p>

<p>I prefer checking accounts with the lowest fees obviously: lowest balance needed to be free, no transaction fees, low fees on depositing etc.</p>
","<p>As far as getting a bank account, the simple answer is ""it depends"". Banks can legally open an account without an SSN (I've done it!), but many will not do so except under exceptional circumstances.  However presuming you're spending the time you're in the US travelling around rather than being at a single address it's unlikely that most banks will allow you to open an account without some form of fixed address.</p>

<p>However there is a good alternative - a ""reloadable"" Pre-Paid Credit Card.  These go under a number of different names such as <a href=""https://www.americanexpress.com/us/content/prepaid/reloadable-cards.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Serve</a> from American Express and <a href=""https://www.greendot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">GreenDot</a> and many others who do cards from both <a href=""http://usa.visa.com/personal/cards/prepaid/prepaid-card.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Visa</a> and <a href=""http://www.mastercard.us/prepaid-card.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Mastercard</a>. These cards normally cost a few dollars to buy, and otherwise generally have no or very low fees (eg, Serve costs $1/month).</p>

<p>Note that these cards are NOT the same as the pre-paid ""gift cards"" many places sell. Those generally only come with a fixed amount of credit and can not be recharged, but more importantly if your card is lost or stolen, they can not be replaced like the cards mentioned above.</p>

<p>You don't mention where you are from, but a potentially better option is to look for cards in your home country that do not charge international fees.  These used to be very uncommon, but in recent years more and more banks have started offering them.</p>

"Why is security screening done at the gate in some airports?","10943","","<p>I've noticed that when taking non-Schengen flights at AMS (Schiphol airport, Amsterdam), there is no centralized security check after you enter the airport and go through passport control. Instead, the security check happens right at the gate. The security checkpoint opens about an hour before the flight departs from that gate. This system seems to have a huge number of disadvantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>It must be really expensive - there's an X-ray machine, metal detectors, and for some gates even millimeter wave scanners at <em>each</em> gate. </li>
<li>Also, adding to the expense, there are washrooms at <em>each</em> gate, since passengers can no longer use the common area washrooms after passing through security.</li>
<li>It's really inconvenient for the passengers. There's no way to reach the seats inside the gate area before the security checkpoint opens, so people are forced to either wait far away in other areas of the airport, or (as I've seen many people do) sit on the floor, which is especially a problem for the elderly, etc.</li>
<li>The security lineup tends to be very long, since all of a sudden an entire plane-full of people tries to pass through a checkpoint with very limited equipment (i.e. usually just 1 x-ray machine)</li>
<li>Once inside the area, it's essentially an entire plane-full of people in a small area with no way to spread out, so there's always a shortage of seats</li>
<li>There's no way to buy e.g. a bottle of water (not to mention duty-free alcohol) in the secure area of the airport and bring it onto the plane, something that is generally allowed in typical airports</li>
<li>Security screening personnel must roam around the airport from gate to gate</li>
</ul>

<p>I can think of only one advantage of this system: Arriving flights from non-Schengen countries (whose passengers must be re-screened for security) can just let people out of the plane through the gate - there's no need to ""route"" them through the secure area to a non-secure area, since everything is essentially a non-secure area. But surely this could have been solved at the airport design stage, as it is solved in many airports worldwide? Is this just a design oversight or a conscious decision? Are there other reasons to use such a system that I'm not thinking of? Is this typical in other European airports?</p>
","<p>Screening at the gate is done at a number of other major airports, including Singapore Changi, Kuala Lumpur International, etc.  And it has one <em>massive</em> advantage from the airport operator's point of view: <strong>you don't need to separate arrivals and departures</strong>.</p>

<p>This means that instead of essentially duplicating all routes to the aircraft (one for passengers boarding, one for passengers disembarking) and maintaining security to ensure that nobody accidentally or intentionally slips from one route to the other, <em>you can basically build one floor less</em>.  Given how large the average airport building is, this is a pretty significant saving.  As an additional bonus, arriving passengers get to shop at all the same restaurants, bars, duty-free shops as departing passengers, which means the airport makes more money and doesn't need to duplicate the duty-free shops either.  Finally, as you note, this means you don't need the special ""transit screening"" that you do need at split-level airports to allow passengers to move from the unsecured arrivals to the secured departures areas.</p>

<p>Also, handling security at each gate may seem a bit inefficient, but it actually provides massive <em>maximum</em> capacity advantages.  If your screening is centralized, and you've got a lot of flights leaving at once, then your central security may get really badly backed up.  I've waited in 500m+ security lines in Heathrow, which has central security and thus has to funnel everybody through that single point of failure, where they wait fuming, tweeting about how much they hate LHR.  In Changi, problem solved: you just let people into departures, where they can shop, eat, drink and be merry, and screen them a few hundred a time at the gates.</p>

<p>As for disadvantages, the cost to the airport of maintaining all the redundant screening areas isn't <em>that</em> huge, since the main cost of security is manpower, and each screening area is unattended when there are no flights using that particular gate.  I can't recall exactly how AMS is set up, but in SIN each set of security equipment in T1/T2 is typically shared by a gate or two, with T3 having semi-central security checkpoints each covering half a dozen gates or so.</p>

"Which queue for a EU/non-EU couple travelling through UK Immigration Control together?","10922","","<p>I'll be arriving at Heathrow in June 2015 with my current girlfriend for a holiday in the UK. I've been trying to find out which immigration queue to join at Heathrow Passport Control without much luck. I have a British passport, my girlfriend has a non-EU passport.   </p>

<p>Should I join the EU queue and she the non-EU queue or should we both queue together (and if so, which of the queues should we join)?</p>
","<p>This question arises all the time because they have never published a clear policy.  They will, however, tell you their policy in a letter if you write to them.</p>

<p>You should join the EU queue if you are <em>married</em>.  Their policy is not to separate families during immigration control, and they will take all reasonable steps to avoid separating families.  But since your question involves a girl friend, this policy does not apply.  So if your girlfriend joins the EU queue, she would expect a sharp rebuke and instructed to join the non-EU queue. This is especially true if there are lots of people arriving and they are busy.</p>

<p>Note: There have been occasions where an EU/non-EU couple used the non-EU queue and were simply <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/uk/brodie-clark"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">waved through</a> by the IO.  This makes the non-EU person an illegal entrant. Don't let it happen.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the past, under the last government, some of these checks were
  lifted at times of pressure on the border.</p>
  
  <p>In the summer of 2008 Warnings Index checks were suspended on EEA
  nationals - children and adults - on Eurostar services. At Calais,
  Warnings Index checks were suspended on European Economic Area and UK
  car passengers - again, adults as well as children were not run
  against the Index. Since 2008, at various ports and airports, this

<p>So you and your girlfriend should both join the non-EU queue if you want to transit controls together.

<p>UK immigration queues are segregated by <strong>type of passport</strong>, not the visa that the person carries.  EU/UK nationals can use either queue, but non-EU nationals who are not travelling as documented family members need to use the queues as explained above.</p>

"Statistically, is there a safest seat on the plane if it crashes?","10917","","<p>So to clarify, there are lots of different planes, so for the sake of argument, there are areas:</p>

"European countries ""shut down"" in August?","10866","","<p>I am mainly interested in hearing about France (Paris, in particular) and Italy (Venice, in particular), though this may hold for other European countries as well, hence the broad title.</p>

<p>I have heard from a few sources that because many locals go on vacation, much of Paris and Italy closes down during August, but many tourist attractions remain open. My question is: to what extent is this true, and to what extent would this affect a tourist's ability to function, e.g., go out to restaurants, museums, plays, shops, etc.?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: In your answers, can you also comment on the extent that this exodus affects public transportation?</p>
","<p>What I can tell you about northern Italy (anywhere between Milano and Venice) is that the cities basically closes down in August (except for tourist destinations such as museums and churches), and even more so in the afternoon. If you will be walking the streets of any town in that area (Modena, Padua, Ravenna, Verona, etc), it will be like in a Zombie movie - except no Zombies. The city will wake up again in the late afternoon once the sunlight begins to fade. If you have been walking around in the afternoon, you will be ready to take a nap right when everyone wakes up and goes down to the street to take a drink.</p>

<p>So the best is to do as the locals do: Get up at 8:00-9:00 to get breakfast, buy something at the local markets, maybe have an early lunch, visit a museum. Then go to bed, take a nap, wake up at 6:00pm and start at the local cafe with a cocktail, stay up until 2am carousing the streets, stopping everywhere to enjoy, rinse &amp; repeat.</p>

<p>Now Venice is a different animal. Since it is THAT popular with tourists, you need to prepare mentally and physically for what you are up to. ANY tourist destination at all, wherever you go, as opposed to even the most famous places west of Venice will be packed. And with packed I mean 2+ hours of waiting time to get in. It's literally insane. You will not want to do it. On top of that, the prices are ridiculous. Venice is best in October or similar, in August, all the world will be there, and you will be at the end of the line.</p>

<p>My recommendation would be for an unforgettable holiday, if you chose to go to this area:</p>

<ul>
<li>Get a list of the world heritage sites in that area, there a MANY.</li>
<li>Book small hotels right between the towns, not in the town center, they hardly cost anything. If you want to spend more, there are AMAZING boutique hotels right downtown</li>
<li>rent a cheap, small car, the distances are small anyhow</li>

"How to politely ask people from East Asia to give way?","10849","","<p>I've arrived in Australia 9 months ago and I've noticed that often when asking people from East Asia to ""give way"" they will simply ignore me or even answer a ""yes"" but not move at all.</p>

<p>This is a situation that at least my wife, friends and work mates also faced a lot of times.</p>

<p>Some examples: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>I went to an electronics shop some days ago and there was this Asian girl standing in front of a product section that I wanted to check. She was texting on her phone. I politely asked ""can I take a look at these?"" and all she did was nod her head and still block the view.</p></li>
<li><p>Leaving the train. Several times I was trying to hop off the train and a group of Asians would block the way and ignore my desperate ""excuse me, guys"".</p></li>
<li><p>Groups of 5+ East Asian people blocking the pathway while chatting and/or texting. ""Excuse me"" also didn't work.</p></li>
<li><p>Same as above, but getting hit in the shoulder by one of them and not even getting a ""Sorry""</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So obviously I don't know if it's a cultural thing or not. It just seems that our standard ""excuse me"" has another meaning to them.</p>

<p>What is the possible reason for this behavior and how can I politely
ask to give way which is culturally understood by East Asians? Or how can I ask to give way in a way which is universally understood?</p>
","<p>I'm highly certain that it is mostly Japanese, not all Asian people, that are so oblivious to other people around them. To say <em>Asians</em> in this context sounds like to ask how to avoid rude Westerners that try to hug you whenever you meet, even though that culture is only the subclasses of the Western countries.</p>

<p>To deal with the situations you faced, I will share some tips.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If all she does is nod or say something like ""Ah~~~"", then it is likely that she either doesn't understand English, or is so obsessed with the smartphone that she doesn't hear what you are saying. Then you should just step in to check what you want while putting your hand forward. She will likely start to stagger while watching her smartphone.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to get off the train, just keep saying ""sorry"" multiple times all the while stepping into the exit. Many people understand that you want to get off in the context and will likely make an empty room for you.</p></li>
<li><p>Although you might feel that it is not you that should feel sorry, saying <em>Sorry</em> would work better than <em>Excuse me</em>. This is simply because most people, especially those who are not good at English, are far more accustomed to hearing the former than the latter. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Honestly, I feel with you. My biggest pet peeve is a group of people walking in front of me all on a horizontal line to block the entire pathway. I usually just force my way into the group to pass through it, in case you wanted to know.</p>

"Are there any issues with using credit cards in Germany?","10834","","<p>On my last trip to Germany my credit cards (chip-based Visa and MasterCard) were declined more than usual. I've been there like 10 times and haven't noticed this before but on this trip train ticket machines refused to service them, small shops didn't accept them and even a huge consumer electronics network store Mediamarkt said ""EC cards only"". (Whatever ""EC card"" is)</p>

<p>Has anything changed in regard to credit cards in Germany in recent years or was I just unlucky this time? And what's the root of this problem? As far as I understand these chip-based credit cards technically are not that different (if at all) from debit/atm cards.</p>
","<p>In short: no.</p>

<p>Mostly, credit card acceptance in Germany is still the exception rather than the norm. There are a couple of places, however, where you can expect at least Visa and MC to be accepted, most notably ATMs and gas stations.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href=""http://www.changiairport.com/passenger-guide/safety-and-security/travel-tips-for-departure"">Singapore Changi Airport</a></p>

<p>All types of razor are prohibited. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Therefore, passengers should not have any sharp objects with them or
  in their hand-carried baggage (for example pocket knives, nail files,
  box cutters, razors, scissors, corkscrews, any sharp/pointed objects,
  etc.)</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://www.lifeatheathrow.com/heathrow-security.html"">Heathrow</a></p>

<p>Plastic moulded razors are allowed, but razors that can be opened and razors with changeable blades are prohibited. I assume disposable razor = plastic moulded razor. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Razors that have the blade set into a plastic moulding are allowed,
  but razors that can be opened and the razor blade removed are
  prohibited</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://www.tsa.gov/travelers/airtravel/prohibited/permitted-prohibited-items.shtm"">Airport in US</a></p>

<p>Disposable Razors (including razor with removable razor blades/catridges) are permitted.
I believe the scissors you mentioned have length > than 4 inches, that's why it was confiscated.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Scissors - metal with pointed tips and blades shorter than four inches are permitted.
  Razor-Type Blades - such as box cutters, utility knives, and safety razor blades are not permitted. (disposable razors and their cartridges are permitted)</p>

Do I need to pass customs? Do I need the same documents as I would need when entering via an airport or a harbor?</p>

<p>Suppose I don't start on a shore, but on a boat in international waters. Do the same rules apply?</p>
","<p>You can only pass through customs (or immigration) through designated ports of entry. This means that unless you have a special pass (for example, ship crews have special passes), you need to go through the customs and immigration process.  This is a burden on you as the traveler.</p>

<p>It does not matter where you start the journey.</p>

<p>Your status in the destination country/territory will depend on your current nationality. For example, if you are allowed to legally reside and visit a country without a visa, you will not be an illegal alien (to prove this though, you'll have to provide documentation - like a passport).</p>

<p>However, there will still be issues with your departure as your arrival was not legal or documented.  If questioned by police you will most likely be detained and deported for illegally entering the country.</p>

<p>As for goods (customs), it is more restrictive as each country has their own rules on what goods are allowed entry customs free, which goods need to be declared and which goods are forbidden.</p>

<p>In either way the burden is on you to make sure your travel is legal and authorized <em>even if you don't need a visa to travel to the country; or your port/manner of entry was not through the normal channels</em>.</p>

<p>As soon as I pick up my luggage I want to go to the train so that I have some time to spare in Oslo.</p>

<p>I was wondering how easy it is to buy a ticket at the airport, are there any vending machines around where you just can buy a ticket?</p>
","<p>What you're looking for is the Airport Express Train (Flytoget). It's about 20 minutes ride from the airport to the Oslo Central station. No need to book a ticket in advance, there's always seats available. For timetable, check out <a href=""http://www.flytoget.no/eng/Stations/Flytoget-Airport-Express-train-station-at-Oslo-Airport"">http://www.flytoget.no/eng/Stations/Flytoget-Airport-Express-train-station-at-Oslo-Airport</a>.</p>

<p>As for the ticket, you have two options. You can either buy your ticket from a vending machine that's located in the baggage claim area (somewhere near the exit/customs), or you can just swipe your credit card (and select destination) at the card readers that are located right before the escalators that take you to the platform. The card readers will not print a receipt/ticket. If you need a receipt, you have to register at the Flytoget site, and add your credit card info. You don't need to do this before you use your credit card. Once you register and add you card info, you'll see all the trips that were paid with your card, and you'll be able to print receipts.</p>

"Can e-cigarettes / vaping set off smoke detectors?","10769","","<p>I work in a backpacker hostel in Australia. Of course smoking is not allowed inside the building and there are smoke detectors in every room and corridor.</p>

<p>By law in Australia the smoke detectors in backpacker hostels set off a fire alarm which we are not permitted to turn off and the fire department is automatically notified. The entire hostel must be evacuated until they arrive and only they are permitted to turn off the alarm. Even in the middle of the night and bad weather. The charge for a false alarm is nearing $1,000.</p>

<p>(These regulations are specific to backpacker accommodation due to a couple of fires in which many travellers died.)</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago I saw for the first time a guest ""vaping"" an e-cigarette. It emits a vapour that looks similar to cigarette smoke. He told me that it's fine to use these things in doors.</p>

<p>But I wonder, do smoke detectors specifically and only detect smoke particles? Is there zero possibility that e-cigarette vapour could ever set off a smoke detector?</p>
","<p>The answer is 'it depends' - on the type of smoke detector an how close the smoker is to the alarm, how much vapor is produced etc.</p>

<p>For the optical sensor type firealarms <a href=""http://www.electroniccigaretteconsumerreviews.com/do-e-cigarettes-set-off-smoke-alarms-or-smoke-detectors/"">here is a demonstration they can be set off by vapor</a> - while <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jx5U3ULrc-s"">here is one that demonstrates they're not</a>. I.e. depends on how much vapor you have and how often it is blown into the detector.</p>

<p>That said, it seems quite unlikely such a sensor would be triggered by vapor in normal circumstances - but as you mention in comments, sitting on top of a bunk bed, with a low ceiling may be a different matter.</p>

<p>More modern sensors based on ionization/CO detection should not be triggered by vapor, <a href=""http://ecigaretteguide.blogspot.it/2012/06/does-vapor-smoke-coming-from-e-cigs.html"">see here for instance</a>.</p>

Now, the <a href=""http://www.hostelworld.com/myworld/points/"" rel=""nofollow"">MyWorld Points page</a> (n.b. you need to be logged in) says you need 1000 points to get a Gold Membership, but I get a goody bag instead whenever I hit 500 points which - surprise, surprise - <em>also</em> contains a Gold Card!

"Does the European number for emergencies (112) really work in Germany?","10761","","<p>One night of some months ago I realized there were some burglars in the apartment below mine. As an Italian living in Germany, I didn't know the number to call the police, but I knew that in all Europe there's a common number for emergencies, 112, and I was confident it was enough. I dialled it and started to explain what had happened. Some seconds later, I was interrupted: ""In this case you need the police. This is the fire brigade. Please call 110."" They didn't even offer to transfer the call themselves. Maybe I could have asked for that, but I didn't think about it. So I just hung up and dialled 110, and at last I was able to talk to the police.</p>

<p>Some months later I saw a fire in the building in front of mine (apparently I live in a place where you can't get bored), and I called the fire brigade. I dialled 112 and spoke with them. It was the right number.</p>

<p>So, it seems to me that 112 isn't really working as expected: it's just the number of the fire brigade, full stop. But as far as I can tell, this shouldn't be the case. According to <a href=""https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/112"">the official website of the European Commission</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li><p>You can call 112 from fixed and mobile phones to contact any
  emergency service: an ambulance, the fire brigade <strong>or the police</strong>.</p></li>
  <li><p>A specially trained operator will answer any 112 call. <strong>The operator
  will either deal with the request directly or transfer the call to
  the most appropriate emergency service</strong> depending on the national
  organisation of emergency services.</p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Then, according to <a href=""https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/eu-rules-112"">another page</a> on the same site,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>112 calls must be appropriately answered and handled, <strong>irrespective of whether other emergency numbers exist</strong> in a specific country;</p>
  
  <p><strong>The European Commission ensures that European rules on 112 are correctly applied in the European Union</strong> and has launched 17 infringement proceedings against Member States that have not complied with the relevant requirements of EU law. All cases are now closed following corrective measures in the countries concerned.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems to me that calling 112 should have been enough. But there's even more!<br>
<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/112_(emergency_telephone_number)"">Wikipedia</a> says this about 112:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>112 is a part of the GSM standard and all GSM-compatible telephone handsets are able to dial 112 even when locked or with no SIM card present.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But then, again the site of the European Commission, <a href=""https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/112-germany"">on another page specific to Germany</a>, says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is not possible to call 112 from a mobile phone without a SIM card.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Why wasn't my call properly dealt with? Calling 112 made me lose around 30 seconds, maybe more. In an emergency this could make a huge difference. Why did it happen? Isn't this a violation of European rules? Is it normal? Has anyone had similar experiences?</p></li>
<li><p>I recently bought a new phone, but I'm still keeping my old one, without a SIM card. Would I be able to use it to call 112, as per the GSM standard, or not?</p></li>
<li><p>When I called 112 I used my Italian SIM card. Then, when they told me to call 110, I thought that being a ""non standard"" number there could have been problems, and I picked up my German phone and used that. If I had used my Italian number again, would it have worked?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Regarding 2) and 3), unfortunately calling 112 or 110 if there's no emergency is a crime, otherwise I would just test it.</p>
","<ol>
<li><p>Difficult to say. The 112 emergency dispatcher should be able to connect you with the police, even if you also can call the police directly on the number 110. Perhaps the operator did not consider a break-in in an appartment urgent enough to do the job for you.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, it violates the GSM standard, but calling emergency services in Germany from a cell phone requires an active SIM card. The reason was to prevent hoax calls from inactive, and therefore unidentifiable cellphones.</p></li>
<li><p>You could also have dialled 110 with your Italian SIM card. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>There are a few differences between dialling 110 and 112 from a cell phone, but they are in most situations not relevant:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When you dial 110, the call is basically treated as a regular phone call. Your phone must be registered on a supported network and the cell you are connected to must have capacity to handle an additional call. The call will hence only go through if you are within coverage of your home network, or a network you may roam on and the cell capacity is not exhausted.</p></li>
<li><p>When you dial 112, the call is already at the initial signalling level treated as an emergency call. The cell phone will try to connect through any available provider, even if you are regularly not allowed to use that provider's network. The cell phone will use a priority procedure when setting up the call and if the cell capacity is exhausted, other calls will be dropped by the network to 'give room' for your emergency call.</p></li>

"Why do Indian citizens need many visas?","10732","","<p>As an Indian citizen, this has always been my trouble. No matter where I go, I always need a visa. My father has exhausted his passports thrice because he travels a good amount. In short, we need visas for every place.</p>

<p>So my question simply is <strong>Why?</strong></p>

<p>India is a developing country, agreed. But we are also one of the fastest growing economies and seem to have okayish diplomatic relations with most countries.</p>

<p>We have an Indian diaspora in a lot of countries which I would presume should improve as well as worsen the situation. Immigration is pretty high outside India and I don't disagree to that, but #76 in the most useful passports list for a country with a large population and a lot of talented people seems quite odd.</p>

<p>Are there any reasons which I am missing out or has there been any analysis on this which would make this oddity clearer to me?</p>
","<p>I believe the answer is immigration, immigration and immigration (real or perceived). In Europe at least, visa requirements and enforcement measures are motivated mostly by the risk that the people in question would try to enter the country and stay there illegally (and of course all the political posturing around that risk).</p>

<p>It could be argued that immigration is generally a net gain for a country (cf. your point about talented people) or that the risk of illegal immigration is overblown or entirely the result of an overly restrictive policy regarding <em>legal</em> immigration but none of this changes the politics.</p>

<p>Just to provide some direct evidence of all this, the following is from the preamble of the Schengen visa code:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In accordance with Article 61 of the Treaty, the creation of an area in which persons may move freely should be accompanied by measures with respect to external border controls, asylum and immigration.</p>
  
  <p>[…]</p>
  
  <p>As regards visa policy, the establishment of a ‘common corpus’ of legislation, particularly via the consolidation and development of the acquis (the relevant provisions of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985 and the Common Consular Instructions, is one of the fundamental components of ‘<strong>further development of the common visa policy as part of a multi-layer system aimed at facilitating legitimate travel and tackling illegal immigration</strong> through further harmonisation of national legislation and handling practices at local consular missions’, as defined in the Hague Programme: strengthening freedom, security and justice in the European Union.</p>
  
  <p>[…]</p>
  
  <p><strong>It is necessary to set out rules on the transit through international areas of airports in order to combat illegal immigration.</strong> Thus nationals from a common list of third countries should be required to hold airport transit visas. Nevertheless, in urgent cases of mass influx of illegal immigrants, Member States should be allowed to impose such a requirement on nationals of third countries other than those listed in the common list. Member States’ individual decisions should be reviewed on an annual basis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is only one example but it's explicitly all about immigration. I think the other considerations (reciprocity, passports) only factor in tangentially.</p>

<p>Note that until now the EU has not really been insisting so strongly on reciprocity, so that US citizens still enjoy visa-free visits to the whole Schengen area despite the fact that after years of discussion there are still several EU countries whose citizens are not eligible for the Visa Waiver Program. Similarly, some or all EU citizens enjoy visa-free (or visa-on-arrival) access to countries such as Turkey, Morocco, Tunisia and most of South America so reciprocity is clearly overemphasized as an explanation.</p>

"What happens if you are refused entry between two countries?","10724","","<p>Last month, I was travelling on a backpacking trip across Russia and the Baltic states (Schengen zone). <strong>I'm an Indian by nationality.</strong> So I had to get the respective single entry visa for Russia and Schengen Europe.</p>

<p>At the border crossing into Estonia by road (at Ivangorod-Narva), I exited the Russian border with an exit stamp (so now I can't go back to Russia since I had a single entry visa). When I was at the immigration checkpoint of Estonia, I was heavily questioned on the intent of my travel to Europe while entering Estonia by road. </p>

<p><em>Though I finally got into Europe, It got me wondering - what happens if a foreign national is denied entry into a country not at the airport but by land between 2 countries he cannot go into ?</em></p>

<p>Generally, if you are denied entry at the airport the airline has the obligation to fly you back to your country. But what happens when you are stuck between two countries and you cant get into either ? What happens to you then ?</p>
","<p>If you are at a land border and inadmissible in both directions, you'll be taken to a detention centre.  In the scenario you described, most likely <a href=""http://www.vangla.ee/et/asutused/viru-vangla"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Viru</a>. They will book you in and then go over your travel document(s) with a view to determining where you are admissible.  They will contact the consulate where you have citizenship and let them know you are in custody.</p>

<p>Once they have determined the next steps, they will serve you with a removal order.  If it happens in Russia, you'll go to the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magistrates%27_court_(Russia)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Мировой суд</a> (local magistrate) and get a five year ban, you can also expect to get dunned for their expense.  Estonia has a similar sanction, but it operates under the <a href=""http://www.ejil.org/article.php?article=2043&amp;issue=102"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">EEA judicial system</a>.  </p>

<p>Once the paperwork is complete, you'll be escorted to a removal centre.  In Estonia, it would be at <a href=""http://www.tallinn-airport.ee/eng/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Tallinn Airport</a>, and in Russia there's one at <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheremetyevo_International_Airport"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sheremetyevo 2</a>.  In most cases, you'll be issued a one-way travel document and placed on the appropriate (civil) flight.  Nobody gets stuck forever in a gulag.  If the receiving country has no problems with you, the removing country will give your actual travel document to the airline staff and you'll get it back once the flight has cleared the removing country's air space.</p>

<p>I've been in the one at Sheremetyevo (on the representation side), the biggest concern they have is finding out the <em>REAL</em> reason you are in their country.  Also, you need to really hope there were no crimes committed in the area where you were caught.  I have no experience in Tallinn. Overall, it's comparable to detention anywhere; the biggest problem people face is the language barrier in the day-to-day world as their paperwork is getting sorted out.  From end-to-end, the process would take a maximum of two weeks.  </p>

<p>When you debrief people who have been removed, they invariably report that the conditions are civil, and the most harrowing part of the experience was the screwballs they encountered whilst in detention.  </p>

<p>NOTE: your scenario takes place where there are clear land borders.  If your scenario took place at a disputed border, like in Morocco, things could get exponentially more complex very quickly.  This answer is scoped to stable countries only and the intervention occurs at a control point. If you are caught deeply inland in Russia, you will be in <strong><em>trouble</em></strong>.  Also countries and regions not mentioned in this answer are out of scope.</p>

"Which meals are served on long flights and in what order?","10708","","<p>I'm flying <code>AMS</code> - <code>LAX</code> (with KLM) next month and return a month later. I was wondering which meals would be served and in what order?</p>

<p>Is there any logic behind it or does it depend on the choice of the carrier? One might think you'll be served the first meal in the timezone of departure and the last one in the timezone of arrival, but this can result in a double lunch or a double breakfast.</p>

<p>In case it might matter: We take off at 10am and land at noon and on the return flight takes off at 2pm and lands at 9am.</p>
","<p>Your best source of this information is your airline's website, even if you didn't book with them. For example, <a href=""https://www.klm.com/travel/ca_en/prepare_for_travel/on_board/dining_on_board/dining_in_economy_class.htm#p2"">the KLM page on intercontinental meals</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Economy Class intercontinental</strong></p>
  
  <p>On all KLM intercontinental flights, we welcome you on board with a beverage of choice. You are then served your choice of one of our two Delicious hot meals. After dinner, we offer complimentary coffee, tea or a liqueur.</p>
  
  <p>On shorter flights, we serve a sandwich or other snack before landing. On longer flights, we serve a second meal and snacks such as ice cream or sandwiches.</p>
  
  <p>On flights with an early morning arrival time, we serve a delicious breakfast.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Beverages</strong> 
  We serve hot and cold drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic), including soft drinks, fruit juice, beer and wine, together with your meal. Throughout the entire flight, we offer something to drink once every hour.</p>
  
  <p><strong>A la carte menu</strong>
  On most KLM intercontinental flights departing from Amsterdam, you have an even larger selection of hot meals to choose from when you order an à la carte meal at KLM.com before your flight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are links on that page to more information.</p>

<hr>

<p>For the more general issue of timing, it's my experience that regardless of the length of the flight or the time of day, the first meal is served as close to ""immediately"" as they can do. A longer flight is usually a larger plane, so ""immediately"" will take longer, but the process is consistently:</p>

<ul>
<li>board, get everyone settled</li>
<li>announcements and safety video while still on ground, possibly taxi-ing</li>
<li>take off</li>
<li>reach height, seat belt sign off</li>
<li>small pause (10-15 min) for people to ask attendants for things, reset entertainment system, people to use the bathroom</li>
<li>up and down the aisles delivering headsets (quick because most people have headsets)</li>
<li>drink service. On a large full plane this can take over half an hour</li>
<li>pause with aisles clear again so  people can go to the bathroom and ask for stuff</li>
<li>gather up garbage from drink service</li>
<li>meal service</li>
</ul>

<p>I'll typically be offered a meal 1-2 hours after getting on the plane and I don't see how it can be any less time than that. If the flight is only four hours, there really isn't a way to do two meal services, because after the meal they need to come by and collect the garbage, then do another drink run, so they would run out of time. (The quote above is about intercontinental flights, which are probably all over 4 hours.) But on a six or eight hour flight, they can do it all again and they typically do. On a 14 hour flight LAX-SYD, United served food three times, though the middle one was just a sandwich. It's much quicker to hand somebody a wrapped item than to ask what they want, put the hot thing on a tray of prepared cold things, pass them the tray which they have to take carefully, etc. Trays also have to be collected afterwards. That said, most European carriers offer a meal service with trays even on a 90 minute flight. They do so by offering food and drinks at the same time - and with a smaller plane it doesn't take as long to ""do"" the whole plane. On long flights the process is a little more drawn out.</p>

"Can I travel to the US with an Indian ECR passport?","10689","","<p>I'm an Indian citizen going to USA for a master's degree. I've my passport but with ECR (Emigration Check Required) stamp on it (born after 1993) because there was difference between my mother's name in my birth certificate and other certificates. I want to know the consequences if I try to travel to USA with an ECR category passport.</p>

<p>What will happen if I book a direct flight which does not travel through Gulf countries (which I am not allowed to go to because of ECR stamp) and what will happen if I book a flight to USA going through Gulf countries? </p>
","<p>ECR is not something the US immigration is concerned with. It is only a formality for India; and it only applies <strong>if you are traveling for work</strong> and even then, to a limited set of countries which does not include the US.</p>

<p>Here is the official reference, from the <a href=""http://moia.gov.in/services.aspx?ID1=105&amp;id=m6&amp;idp=104&amp;mainid=73"">Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs</a> (I have highlighted the relevant parts):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Emigration Act, 1983 provides that no citizen of India shall migrate
  unless he obtains emigration clearance from Protector of Emigrants.
  Similarly, it has been recognized that certain countries (currently
  17) do not have strict laws regulating the entry and employment of
  foreign nationals. They also do not provide avenues for grievance
  redressal. Thus they have been categorized as Emigration Check
  Required (ECR) countries. <strong>Hence, all persons, having ECR endorsed
  passports and going to any of the 17 ECR countries for taking up
  employment require emigration clearance. However, ECR passport holders
  going to any ECR country for purposes other than employment do not
  require emigration clearance.</strong> No specific mention of ECNR is made on
  the passports and the ones not endorsed as ECR, automatically belong
  to ECNR category.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you were to a take any GCC airline, you would be a transit passenger and ECR will not apply.</p>

<p>To put it bluntly; if you are able to exit the country, and you have a valid visa for the US - you should have no issues during your travel and on entry that have to do with your ECR.</p>

"Should I not use double things in a double room if I have booked it as a single guest?","10683","","<p>Some hotels physically don't have single rooms even if they can be booked so.

<p>I guess, hotels don't care about that matter too much, however it is ethically important to me.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/36PFP.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/36PFP.png"" alt=""""></a></p>

<p>P.S. I'm mostly interested in 3 or 4-star hotels.</p>
","<p>Being a supervisor at a well known 3/4 star hotel I speak from experience.</p>

<p>If a consumable/expendable amenity has been provided in your room, it is yours. This includes personal care products, snacks, coffee, toilet paper, etc. </p>

<p>Housekeepers aren't supposed to leave these items for reuse anyways and should ideally be thrown away whether you use them or not. You never know what the guest may have done to an item that appears to be untouched. I heard of a location in Texas that had a guest check in and find drugs stashed in what appeared to be a untouched shampoo bottle.</p>

<p>Taking home items that are NOT depleted by their use is theft. A good example would be towels. Do not take towels home. You may however use all amenities provided to whatever extent and for whatever reasonable purpose you wish. We may not like it, but you can substitute towels for toilet paper. It may be gross, but they will be fully cleaned, sterilized, and reused.</p>

<p>Use of provided amenities is factored into the cost of your room and I believe that you should always use them to get full value for your money</p>

<p>My hotel chain does not provide alcohol in the rooms unless requested with official ID, so I cannot say if alcohol is yours for the room rate when stocked prior to check in. </p>

<p>The number one thing that is appreciated by staff, is to leave your room as clean as possible at check out. The time to clean the room is the number one expense in a room where nothing had been stolen or damaged.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that most hotels will charge you for non-disposable items such as towels or fixtures you steal, and may even press charges if the value is high enough. The same goes for most damage to a room so if you enter a room and find that something is obviously missing or damaged, report it to the front desk to avoid liability.</p>

<p>EDIT: It is also acceptable to move furniture that has not been secured. If you want to join beds together, bring a table from another room you have paid for, or overturn the dresser you may do so. It might be odd and not appreciated, but as long as no damages are incurred that require maintenance to perform repairs, it is acceptable. Simply put, if you need a tool to do it, or undo it, don't.</p>

"Carrying semi-solid food in flights?","10662","","<p>My father is a Vegetarian and a frequent traveler.</p>

"Can a mixed-Muslim unmarried couple share hotel rooms in Indonesia?","10601","","<p>I am a <strong>muslima</strong> with <strong>Moroccan</strong> passport, and my boyfriend is European. Do you think that we might have problems sharing a room in Indonesia? We do not plan on going to Aceh. We will mostly go to Yogjakarta, Borneo, Gili Islands and Bali.</p>

<p>What kind of trouble can we get into if any issue? Will we be just able to book separate rooms if anything occurs? Thanks!</p>
","<p>I also posted an answer in the linked thread, though your case is slightly different. For reference, I lived in Java and now in Bali.</p>

<p>It's not impossible that there are <em>some</em> hotels that will give you trouble, though I find it highly unlikely with neither of you actually being Indonesian. As usual, money speaks and most places would rather make money than enforce religious traditions. Especially in tourist locations (and I doubt you'll go that far 'off the beaten path' that I would not consider it a tourist place)</p>

<p>I can speak from personal experience that I did manage to rent a room with my Indonesian Muslim former girlfriend before.</p>

<p>I can assure you that on Bali and the Gilis you will have no trouble, extremely unlikely in Jogja too, but in some remote places in Borneo it's possible (but still unlikely) you'll have to try another hotel.</p>

","<p>Related: <em><a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/8887"">How to get to/from Washington Dulles International Airport?</a></em></p>

<h2>Metro (rail and bus)</h2>

<p>I'd say the most reliable way to get from Reagan National to Dulles is still transit, despite the <a href=""http://wamu.org/programs/metro_connection/15/10/02/ridership_down_why_dc_area_commuters_say_they_are_dropping_metro"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">well-publicized problems</a> that have come to light since the <a href=""http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/RAR1002.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2009 accident</a>; a taxi comes second, and other options distantly below that.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The simplest route, and the one the <strong><a href=""https://www.wmata.com/schedules/trip-planner/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">WMATA Trip Planner</a></strong> will always favor, is to take the <strong>Blue Line</strong> in the direction of Largo Town Center, exit at <strong><a href=""https://www.wmata.com/rider-guide/stations/rosslyn.cfm?y=46"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Rosslyn</a></strong> in Arlington, then transfer to <strong><a href=""https://www.wmata.com/schedules/timetables/upload/5A_170625.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Metrobus 5A</a></strong>, which will take you to the main terminal at Dulles with only one stop. Traffic delays are to be expected, but the schedule is somewhat padded to accommodate; I have never been on a 5A that was more than 10 minutes delayed in either direction.  </p>

<p>The train requires a <a href=""https://www.wmata.com/fares/smartrip/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SmarTrip card</a>. Total combined regular fare is $9.50 at this writing (maybe 20¢ cheaper off-peak). I would expect the entire trip from terminal-to-terminal to take around an hour and a half. Caution for the future visitor: there have been <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dr-gridlock/wp/2015/09/03/why-metro-wants-to-kill-the-dulles-bus-route/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">repeated attempts to cancel the 5A bus</a>, and more are likely to come in the future, especially after the Silver Line extension to Ashburn opens (perhaps 2019 or 2020).</p></li>
<li><p>If you prefer a longer rail portion of the journey, which has less potential for traffic problems, you can transfer at Rosslyn to the Silver Line, taking it to the end of the line at <strong><a href=""https://www.wmata.com/rider-guide/stations/wiehle-reston.cfm?y=3"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wiehle-Reston East</a></strong>. From Wiehle there is a shuttle bus <a href=""http://www.mwaa.com/sites/default/files/archive/mwaa.com/file/SLExpress_Bus_Locations.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">from the parking garage</a> located to the north side of the station, the <strong><a href=""http://www.metwashairports.com/iad/silver-line-express-bus-metrorail-station"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Silver Line Express</a></strong>, which costs another $5 which is collected when you arrive at the airport. Note that the shuttle is operated by a company under contract with the airport authority, not Metro, and they do not accept SmarTrip for payment. If you can't wait 20 minutes for the next bus, you can usually find taxis waiting at the station.</p></li>
<li><p>As an alternative to the Blue Line, you can take a northbound Yellow Line train (toward Fort Totten, Mount Vernon Square, or Greenbelt) to <a href=""https://www.wmata.com/rider-guide/stations/lenfant-plaza.cfm?y=48"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">L'Enfant Plaza</a> and board the 5A bus from there. You are backtracking <em>and</em> adding bridge delays to your trip, but it may be easier to find a seat at L'Enfant, and the Yellow Line runs more often than the Blue. If you really want to kill time, you could also just transfer to the westbound Orange/Blue/Silver at L'Enfant and proceed from Rosslyn or Wiehle-Reston East as described above.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Taxi or car service</h2>

<p>A taxi or car service is the next natural alternative, but of course subject to the vagaries of some of the <a href=""http://fortune.com/2015/08/26/worst-traffic/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">worst traffic congestion in the United States</a>.  There is rarely, if ever, a traffic delay to be encountered on the Dulles Airport Access Road; the problem of course is getting to the entrance to this road in the first place, which requires time on I-66, the Dulles Toll Road, and/or VA-123 through Tysons Corner. Depending on the time of day I would allot forty minutes to ninety minutes. </p>

<p>The airport authority estimates DCA-IAD fare at <a href=""http://www.flyreagan.com/sites/default/files/taxi_rate_dca.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">around $70</a> not including tip; unlike some cities, there is no flat rate for taxi rides between airports in the Washington area. </p>

<h2>Shared van</h2>

<p>SuperShuttle serves DCA and IAD, and there are other shared van services in the area. It should be cheaper than a taxi for a solo traveler or small groups; SuperShuttle quotes me $32 for the first shared ride adult passenger for a one-way ride from DCA to IAD, and $10 for each additional passenger. The trouble with shared vans is that you do not have much say in when you depart and how you are routed. The operator will want to delay departure to take as many people in the van as possible, and the driver may prefer to drop people off first in various parts of Northern Virginia, compounding your exposure to traffic delays.</p>

<p>SuperShuttle now offers a a non-stop ride option; it quotes me $62. </p>

<h2>One-way car rental</h2>

<p>At the time of day you are traveling, it wouldn't make sense to rent a car, but very early in the morning or very late at night, when transit is not operating, it can make sense in some cases (e.g. a group traveling with numerous pieces of luggage).</p>

<p>At this writing, <a href=""http://www.zipcar.com/washington-dc"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ZipCar</a> is not available at either airport. You can pick one up in Crystal City near DCA, but there is no drop-off point accessible to IAD, except at the transit stations indicated above.</p>

<hr>

<p>As for checking bags, the airline would be the best authority on whether your bag could be checked through. But even in the <a href=""http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/us-airways-dividend-miles-pre-2005-america-west-merger/117994-shuttle-six-times-miles-promotion.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">heydey</a> of the now-defunct <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1027555266329068560"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">UA/US partnership</a>, with USAirways' focus city at DCA and United's hub and gateway at Dulles, a DCA-IAD transfer was uncommon. I really doubt you would be able to do so <em>and have it arrive the same time you do</em> at your final destination; I would plan to reclaim and recheck.</p>

"What does ""hold bag"" mean when traveling with easyJet?","10578","","<p>I will move to the Netherlands and am searching flights to select a price I can afford.</p>

<p>I found easyJet and since I am moving permanently I will have plenty of stuff with me. I am booking:</p>

<ul>
<li>a standard bag (25 * 20 * 45) that I can have on the plane</li>
<li>the bag of my laptop (also on the plane) </li>
<li>the rest of my stuff in two bags, one 27 kg, and one 11 kg</li>

<p>First of all is the meaning of ""hold bag"" the bag that I put in the check-in and the one that I await when arriving, in other words, the one that I don't take with me on the plane?</p>

<p>Second, that says that both should be 20 kg, but my case is one 27 kg and one 11 kg, will that work?</p>
","<p>The hold luggage is the luggage that you check-in at the check-in / bag-drop counter when you arrive to the airport. It will not be accessible to you during the flight and you recover it at the luggage carousel after your arrival. </p>

<p>As written in <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/a/77963/32134"">the excellent answer of @jcaron</a>, easyjet allows you to pool your luggage allowance across bags and even persons on the same booking, as long as no bag is heavier than 32kg. (<em>You should consider accepting his answer instead of mine.</em>) In my old answer I had erroneously assumed this was not possible.  </p>

"When to use the emergency brake in a train?","10576","","<p>In almost every train there is an emergency brake.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jrVPC.jpg""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jrVPC.jpg"" alt=""Emergency break""></a></p>

<p>I was wondering in which scenarios a passenger would need to pull the emergency brake.</p>
","<p>Building on the previous answers:</p>

<p>If you notice a condition where any sensible mind would think that it is extremely dangerous for the train to continue moving. <em>Dangerous</em> here can mean:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If another passanger’s life is in danger and the danger is technical in nature.<br>
(e.g. them being stuck in the door <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/a/85107"">as noted above</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>If something happens to the train that could endanger passengers if the train continues at full speed.<br>
(e.g. an outside door falling off)</p></li>
<li><p>If a condition happens where the train needs to get evacuated <em>quickly</em>.<br>
(e.g. a large fire. Note that small fires are better extinguished on the spot.)</p>

<p>Naturally, you want to make sure that the train doesn’t stop where evacuation would be extremely difficult (on a bridge) or where stopping in case of fire would be deadly (in a tunnel). In Germany, (Switzerland and Austria,) train drivers have a function called <em>Notbremsüberbrückung</em> or <em>NBÜ</em> which they are required to activate if one of the above. In Germany and Austria, this is even signalled on the hectometre signs next to the track. NBÜ is designed to stop the train at the next position safe for evacuation. I’m pretty sure all European countries have this under different names — or else they will have signs affixed to the emergency brakes stating the restriction.</p></li>
<li><p>If anything happens to your carriage that would cause you to immediately hit the brakes when driving a car and a similar thing happens.<br>
(e.g. <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/a/85119"">chunks of steel stabbing through the floor</a>.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The emergency brake can also be helpful if the train hasn’t yet actually left the station but is about to and you need help fast. For example, if another passenger collapsed and requires medical assistance. The reasoning why this should not occur <em>en route</em> is that it is easier for the paramedics to get to stations and they might even be ready at the platform awaiting the train. But if you are already at a station, time is only lost by travelling to the next one.</p>

<p>I already noted that fires need to be large enough that extinguishing them on-site seems impossible for pulling the brake to be warranted. Likewise, if any physical attack <em>originating from other passengers</em> happens (e.g. robberies, shootings), the emergency brake is better <em>not</em> pulled but the train staff notified (so the doors can be kept closed if necessary until the police arrive). There had been a shooting on a local train in the Allgäu where the two suspects jumped of the train at seemingly rather low speeds (I think 80 km/h — on other segments of the route it does 140). One died on the spot, the other was severely injured and didn’t get far, so having a train in motion is the better option.</p>

<p>And to complete the anecdotal evidence: Apparantly on one train route in Switzerland, somebody kept taking the express train that doesn’t stop at his station rather than the (slower) local one that did. He knew exactly where to pull the brake so that the train would slide to a stop exactly at the platform. Somehow, he managed to disappear before the train staff caught him (and they should have been warned because that had happened a few times). Unfortunately, the story is second hand coming from me, so I don’t know whether it was really true.</p>

"What's the cheapest way to travel from Paris to Madrid by train?","10564","","<p>I am planning to travel from Northern Germany to Madrid by train in March.</p>

<p>I found an offer for a night train to Paris for 43 Euro which is pretty cheap. </p>

<p>From Paris to Madrid, my local train station quoted a price of 173 Euro (incl. bed).</p>

<p>In Germany there are passes for <a href=""http://www.bahn.de/i/view/USA/en/prices/germany/quer-durchs-land-ticket.shtml"">unlimited travel for one day</a> on regional trains for 44 Euros.</p>

<p>Do similar deals exist in France and/or Spain?</p>

<p>I don't care how long it takes or how often I have to change. Also I don't consider the costs of any required overnight stays to be part of the costs. I can justify these as different costs visiting a city. </p>

<p>I do prefer to travel during day time.</p>
","<p><strong>The cheapest way is to buy two domestic tickets: either Paris–Hendaye and Irun–Madrid, or Paris–Cerbère and Portbou–Madrid</strong>. See below for details.</p>

<p>For this kind of questions, in general, <a href=""http://www.raildude.com"">Raildude</a> is a useful resource. It is most useful in connection to Interrail, but also useful in general to get an overview of connections.</p>

<p>For example, for Paris–Madrid, it links <a href=""http://www.raildude.com/en/train-connections-city/paris-madrid/france-spain/42"">six possible connections</a>. Normally, the best connections is to take the Corail Lunéa from Paris to the Franco-Spanish border at Hendaye/Irun, then take a Spanish domestic train from there. According to Raildude, this connection is currently (2013-01-17) suspended, but it's bookable at tgv-europe.com (see below), so I'm not so sure anymore how good Raildude really is ;). </p>

<p>To find the cheapest option, you have two alternatives:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Either find a date that the <a href=""http://www.elipsos.com/en/"">Trenhotel direct connection</a> is affordable. In a <em>Super reclining seat</em>, it might not have to be as expensive as your quote. I recall some tickets were as cheap as 70€, but I don't find any examples cheaper than the price you quoted right now.</p></li>
<li><p>Or, probably cheaper, have separate tickets for the French and Spanish legs. This means either a French night train and a Spanish day train, or a French day train, a night at the border, and another Spanish day train. There's also a Spanish night train to Portugal that you could depart from in the middle of the night, but that's neither cheap nor comfortable.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Inside France, you can use the <a href=""http://calendar.tgv-europe.com/en"">TGV Europe low-price calendar</a> to find cheap connections (day or night). Try to search from Paris to Hendaye. Most days the cheapest ticket is 33€, but on some days tickets are as cheap as 17€. The cheapest ticket is either a seat on a day train, or a seat on a night train. Look carefully from what station in Paris the train departs, because night trains depart from a different station.</p></li>
<li><p>Inside Spain, consult <a href=""http://www.renfe.com/"">www.renfe.com</a>. Since you have already selected the date for the French part, you have less flexibility here, but my experience is anyway that ticket prices are less varying in Spain than in France. The interface is in Spanish; there is an English language interface, but it may be less complete. Renfe.com will normally only list direct trains. Click on <em>Compra de biletes</em> and search <em>Irun</em> to <em>Madrid</em>. <em>Irun</em> – <em>Hendaye</em> is just 5 km, and most domestic trains continue to the first station across the border, <em>even if domestic train sites do not list this</em>. Check a timetable to be sure. <em>Ida</em> means one way, <em>Ida y vuelta</em> means round trip. For March, I'm currently finding tickets for as little as €16.65, which would put your total train Paris–Madrid to potentially less than 35€, though more likely around 60€ since you rarely get the cheapest option for all legs.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>From the comments below, you may also try <em>Paris</em> – <em>Figueres</em> and <em>Figueres</em> – <em>Madrid</em> (daytime 5 hours), or <em>Paris</em> – <em>Cerbère</em>, <em>Port Bou</em> – <em>Barcelona</em>, and <em>Barcelona</em> – <em>Madrid</em>, or, at night, directly <em>Port Bou</em> – <em>Madrid</em>. The TGV doesn't serve Cerbère or Port Bou (and is therefore not listed in the low-price calendar listed above), but can be reached by regional train from <em>Perpignan</em> in 30 minutes, hourly connections from Paris (check the travel-planner at <a href=""http://www.bahn.de"">Bahn.de</a>. Then the night train Port Bou – Madrid departs 19.03, arrival Madrid 07.21. Unlike international night trains, domestic night trains in Spain are not very expensive.</p>

<p>One other alternative:
If you're going from Germany to Spain and back all the way by train, you might want to consider to get an  <a href=""http://www.interrail.eu/"">Interrail Global Pass</a>. You'll need to buy a 50%-ticket to and from the border of your own country, but after that you only need reservations. Particularly if you're in the youth category (below 26 years old) that might very well lead to a cheaper journey, with the big advantage that your tickets are <em>flexible</em>, and can be rebooked at (almost) no financial cost. Rebooking however can involve long queues at railway stations, particularly in France...</p>

It felt like I have done something inappropriate, although we have been very informal at that point.</p>

<p>Is it inappropriate to 'over-wai'? Or to joke about 'wai-ing'?</p>

  <p>The Thai greeting referred to as the wai (Thai: ไหว้, pronounced <code>wâi</code>) consists of a slight bow, with the palms pressed together in a prayer-like fashion.

","<p><em>Farang</em> tourists usually don't <em>wai</em> properly, when they do. They're usually quite awkward, and hand placement and movement are usually incorrect, or awkward at best.</p>

<p>Waiing high three times is weird, at best. That would be something addressed to a monk, maybe. Keep it simple. A single wai, a couple of seconds, mid-height, is enough. Or just a simple thank you.</p>

"Medical Insurance for Canadian visiting United States","10546","","<p>My girlfriend is going to be staying with me in the USA for a few months shortly. She is a Canadian citizen.</p>

<p>I would like to get some advice on what kind of Medical insurance (if any) we should be purchasing for her. Since we will be doing things like 4-wheeling it would be nice to be confident she is protected if something bad were to happen.</p>

<p>Should we purchase trip medical insurance? What does the Canadian health-care system cover?</p>
","<p>Check her employer's medical coverage. Mine covers trips up to 21 days, others may be more generous. Also, check her credit card - if she buys the plane tickets on the card she may end up covered as a result of that. </p>

<p>To answer the second part of your question, what does Canadian health care provide, depends on your province - health care is a provincial thing. But to give you Ontario as an example, there is very rudimentary coverage. The <a href=""http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/public/programs/ohip/outofcountry/travellers.aspx"">online advice from the Ontario government</a> says things like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) only covers emergency health
  services at very limited rates. For example, an outpatient visit to a
  U.S. emergency room may cost thousands of dollars for the duration of
  your care, however OHIP will only reimburse up to a total of $50.00
  CDN per day for this service regardless of the severity of the
  situation. <strong><em>If you plan to travel outside of Ontario, it is strongly
  recommended that you obtain additional private medical insurance and
  fully understand what your policy covers.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That emphasis, by the way, is in the original. There is also <a href=""http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/public/publications/ohip/travel.aspx"">a fact sheet</a> which is even gloomier. I doubt the answer will be remarkably different if she lives in another province.</p>

"What is the process for travelling on a World Passport like?","10465","","<p>An answer to one of today's popular questions (<a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/18394/if-like-edward-snowden-your-passport-was-revoked-cancelled-how-can-you-travel"">here</a>) mentions the existence of the ""<a href=""http://www.worldservice.org/docpass.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">World Passport</a>"". This is a passport which is not issued by any nation state, but by an organization that wants to establish a global government in its place.</p>

<p>Surprisingly (to me), the passport is accepted nearly everywhere (see <a href=""http://www.worldservice.org/visas.html?s=1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>), and so seems like a handy thing to have. </p>

<p>I'm curious what travelling under such a document is like in practice though. Does ""accepted"" mean ""after 4 hours of detention and questioning"", or is it just like travelling on any other passport? Do visa requirements end up being stricter? Does the user have to prove their citizenship of some other country?</p>
","<p>I think you have to look a little closer at your page that claims widespread acceptance. each entry is a single claim (supported only by a photo of an entry stamp  page) of one person who has managed to get into that country using a World Passport. Many of the claims are obvious fakes and the photos are not of entry stamps. So for most countries, only a handful of people in the history of the passport have been successful with it. Most of those could simply be due to an immigration official not paying attention.</p>

<p>If you look at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Passport"">the Wikipedia page</a> you will find a much more realistic assessment.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many countries and territories have stated that they do not recognize the World Passport because it is not issued by a competent government authority, and thus does not meet the definition of a passport. As a result, travelling on a World Passport has never been easy. By 1975, Garry Davis [founder of World Service Authority] had already been imprisoned 20 times for his attempts to cross international borders with nothing but a World Passport.</p>
  
  <p>The United States Department of State's official position on the World Passport is that it is just a booklet issued by a private organisation upon payment of a fee, and not a passport.As early as 1991, the US Air Transport Association specifically included the World Passport in a training film as an example of unacceptable travel papers.</p>
  
  <p>In the United Kingdom, the Criminal Records Bureau of the United Kingdom's Home Office states that registered bodies should not accept the World Passport as a proof of identity, warning that ""a fake ‘World Passport’ can be purchased online by members of the public and should not be confused with a genuine passport"".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>EDIT:If you follow the links where the WSA claims that the passports are officially accepted, many of them are letters in which the country says it accepts documents issued by the WSA as an identify document. An identity document is not a travel document, and won't necessarily get you into a country.</p>

"Laws requiring identification at hotel checkin","10456","","<p>I know that in many non-US countries they require identification to check into hotels. However, in the United States I am not aware of any laws that require this. Do they exist?</p>

<p>The reason I ask is that I have attempted to anonymously check into hotels in the United States and found it very difficult to do. For example, one conversation went this way (note that this is an in-person conversation, I am literally standing right in front of the guy at the desk with my bags):</p>

<p>Yes:</p>

<p>I would imagine that legal advice has been sought by hotels and that lawyers have suggested that hotels seek official identification in order to comply with this.</p>

"What happens when an ATM in a country you're travelling through eats your card?","10449","","<p>So you're travelling in some exotic land far from home.</p>

<p>You go to withdraw money from a local ATM so you can have some local currency.</p>

<p>But the ATM swallows your card! If you're lucky you might get a useful reason displayed on the screen, but it usually involved contacting your bank far, far away.</p>

<p>Now assume it's not an ATM installed at an actual bank.</p>

<p><strong>What normally happens under such circumstances?</strong> Can you get your card back from the ATM or must you get a new one issued from back home? If you can get it back, how long would that normally take?</p>

<p>Now there could be complications:</p>

<p>You can't stick around in this town and you can't contact your bank at home immediately due to time differences with home, being a weekend or public holiday, need to catch a flight, or as it was in my case, I had to cross the border or I would be breaking the terms of my visa.</p>

<p>Please don't submit answers on how to get money wired etc. For this question I want to focus on getting the same card or a new card.</p>
","<p>First of all, it depends on why your card is retained. I can think of at least three common situations:</p>

<ol>
<li>You have entered a wrong PIN too many times.</li>
<li>Your issuing bank has decided to cancel and retain your card, e.g. because you have exceeded your credit limit and they want to prevent you from charging the card at ""offline merchants"". This may of course be a mistake by your issuing bank.</li>
<li>A failure (software or mechanical) in the ATM prevents it from returning your card.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the first two situations, you are unlikely to get your card back. </p>

<p>The wrong PIN count is recorded on the card itself, so even if you got it back, it would be retained again the next time you are trying to use it. The wrong PIN counter on the magnetic strip can at least in theory be reset, so that the card itself is reactivated. This can however only be done by the issuing bank. If you are using a card with a chip, the chip may permanently deactivate if you exceed the number of allowed wrong PIN entries. In this case, you need a new physical card.</p>

<p>If the card is retained on request by your issuing bank, the cause is not specified through the ATM network, so the ATM operator would not know <em>why</em> your bank wants the card to be retained. Common practice is to not return such cards to the holder. After all, the operator must assume that your issuing bank requested the card to be retained for some reason. In this case, the card is not necessarily permanently deactivated, but can be reactivated if you are able to solve the issue with your bank. This may of course mean a lot of hassle for you and may require you to convince both your issuing bank and the ATM operator to get in touch with each other, so that you can get your card back.</p>

<p>In the third case, if the ATM swallows your card without obvious reason, you are likely to be able to get your card back. Even if it's not solved immediately, the ATM operator will have no reason to further retain your card, and return it to you. If the ATM is not located in a bank office or you are using the ATM outside the opening hours, there is of course no one immediately available to do this. In many cases, you can find a phone number for customer support located on the ATM. They may or may not be able to help you.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it is not possible to reliably prevent any of these situations from happening. Even if your card is retained by mistake, do not expect too much effort from the ATM operator to help you with a swift solution.</p>

<p>There are however a few things you can do to mitigate the consequences of a retained card:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do not use ATMs outside regular bank offices. If they are malfunctioning and retaining your card by mistake, you are bound to spend much time resolving the issue.</li>
<li>Try to use ATMs in actual banks during the opening hours or at least in a location you can stay until the bank opens again on the next working day. In this case, you have at least someone to talk to, who can actually get access to your card.</li>
<li>Check with your bank or card issuer in advance which options you have if your card is lost or retained. Do they offer emergency cash on a short notice? Are they able at all to issue you a new card, which is delivered to you on short notice in or near the locations you are traveling to? If not, you should consider a travel insurance with such benefits. </li>
<li>If possible, bring at least two ATM cards from different banks. If one of the issuing banks for some reason decides to bar your card, you can use the second card until the issue with the first card is solved.</li>
<li>Do not be unreasonably afraid to carry enough cash. I guess this depends on where you are traveling, but my experience is that it is much more likely to run into problems when trying to pay with or withdraw cash from an ATM card than to be robbed. </li>

As it's the airline's fault, you should get meal vouchers, help with a hotel if needed etc. (Note - the exact level of help you get depends on the jurisdiction you're in, and the home jurisdiction of the airline)</p>

<p>However, if you miss the connecting flight because of your own fault (eg you fall asleep while waiting near the gate), then it's probably no different to if you have two independent bookings....</p>

"Will the traffic and parking be easier in York on a week day or a weekend?","10394","","<p>Driving up from the Peak District, is driving in to York more busy on a week day or a weekend?  </p>

<p>The former would have regular works, the latter would have more tourists.  I'm not sure what the relative numbers are for both in York specifically.</p>
","<p>York is a difficult place for the motorist at any time. For the obvious historical reasons the city centre is not geared up for anything but light-to-reasonable traffic but does have a linked series of single-carriageway roads circumnavigating the Roman Walls to help motorists avoid traversing the city centre itself. </p>

<p>A few miles further out you have an outer ring road which is dual carriageway on the South and Eastern sides (A64), and single-lane on the West and Northern sides. Parking is severely restricted in the centre although there are a few small car parks if you wish to gamble on driving to the centre and finding a space. York counteracts this by having 5 or 6 Park and Rides (<a href=""http://www.york.gov.uk/info/200237/park_and_ride/367/park_and_ride"">info here</a>) dotted around the outer ring road, with judicious use of bus lanes to move visitors and workers into the city centre reasonably efficiently and as York isn't a huge city it's a fairly quick journey.</p>

<p>During the week you have office workers and tourists; at weekends you have shoppers and tourists. The differential between traffic levels between the two is minimal, in my experience. York is generally busy traffic-wise whichever day of the week you would choose to go.</p>

"Is Norway significantly more expensive than other European destinations?","10393","","<p>As a budget traveller, i.e. staying in hostels, using public transport, self catering where possible, is Norway significantly more expensive than say Germany or France? If so what's the best way to minimize the cost? </p>
","<p>It's a generally accepted fact that the Scandinavian countries are the most expensive places to travel. But personally, having travelled a lot within Europe and within Scandinavia, I don't think it's SO much more expensive in comparison to the rest of Europe.</p>

<p>Where prices differ is generally when it comes to alcohol (much more expensive), junk food/convenience food and eating out. If you're willing to buy your own food (and eat a lot of veg and not so much meat) and stay in the most basic hostels then the price difference is negligible. Public transport is in some places cheaper than in other parts of Europe.</p>

<p>But at the same time remember that you can expect to be paying 10kr ($1.8) for a can of coke. A beer can be anywhere upwards of 50kr, often as high as 80-90kr. The tap water is great though, so drinking should not be a problem.</p>

<p>If you're really careful you can probably get by on 6-700kr per day. Don't buy any fast food or junk food, this will really hit you in the wallet. </p>

<p>Rental car contracts seem always to include a clause that disallows driving on such roads (even when renting an SUV).</p>

<p>It's important to find somebody who is able to authorise your request. Dealing with someone who is sympathetic but lacks authority will get you nowhere.  </p>

<p>Real life example below.</p>

<hr>

<p>We rented a car in Australia a few years ago - ALL rental companies had similar ""no off road"" clauses in their contracts. They were generally specific enough that you could probably drive an Australian ""outback"" road but not take ""unformed road""  trails down to picnic areas, dams, lookouts etc. </p>

<p>We had our two adult children with us - we wanted to introduce them to a small glimpse of the ""real"" outback.  We decided  to visit and stay at the world famous in Australia ""Glengarry Hilton"" (yeah, right!!!)  - down about 50 km of roads that you wouldn't usually call roads near Lightning Ridge. </p>

<p>Some of the agreements said ""without written approval"".<br>
The endeavour seemed doomed. Non of the counter staff we spoke to had any expectation that such approval could actually be gained. Nor did their supervisors. </p>

<p>Having identified the company that had the car we most wanted I did an internet hunt for company upper management and found a phone number of a State manager. Instant success. Full understanding of what we wanted to do. Good explanation of WHY they had the policy - and a note that roads to picnic sites etc were fine - all they wanted was a road that had a formal description so the breakdown wagon knew where to find you :-).</p>

"Why do airlines offer more varieties of special-request meals than they actually provide?","10368","","<p>I am a lacto-ovo vegetarian with an annoying tendency to forget to book vegetarian meals when I go flying. When I forget to book ahead, I always ask if they happen to have an extra veg*n meal, but quite understandably they never do: they have precisely what has been pre-booked and nothing more. Which makes sense.</p>

<p>Whenever I <strong>do</strong> remember to book a veg meal well ahead of time, I always specify <em>lacto-ovo vegetarian</em> (i.e., with milk, cheese, cream, eggs, etc., just no fish or meat) if I can.</p>

<p>Despite this, I don’t believe I’ve ever actually been served a lacto-ovo vegetarian meal on any flight I’ve been on: the meal served is invariably <strong>vegan</strong>, despite me booking it well ahead of time as a lacto-ovo vegetarian one. Personally, I find this a bit annoying, because it means pretty much everything gets switched out for beans, rice, raw fruit, and crackers. Everyone else gets yoghurts and cakes—I get carrots and apple sauce. Boo.</p>

<p>I realise that the airlines don’t make the food themselves and have little control over what the dish of the day will be on any particular flight on any given day, but the fact that they do generally explicitly offer the choice between different kinds of veg*n meals would, I assume, imply that Gourmet Gate and similar flight meal companies do <em>make</em> these different variations of meals. If the companies that make the meals only made regular and vegan, there’d be no reason at all for the airlines to ask for any more details.</p>

<p>One also presumes that it would be very easy for these companies to make gradations. A lacto-ovo meal, for instance, would generally just have to switch one component (the meat in the main dish) for a veggie option, which my limited understanding of how meal factories work leads me to believe would be simpler and cheaper than a vegan meal where more or less everything is substituted. True, it would require some additional start-up cost to set up an extra packaging combination, but given the quantities of food these companies make, this extra cost doesn't seem like it ought to be prohibitive.</p>

<p>The way I see it, there are two basic tenets here that work against each other for the airlines:</p>

<ul>
<li>Offering a broad variety of dietary options is good PR and customer service</li>
<li>Having to pay for a broad variety of dietary options is bad for business</li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously a compromise between these two must be found. That is a given.</p>

<p>I have, on occasion, come across airlines who sacrificed customer service for business in this context and basically only offered a regular meal and a vegan meal. No other options. That's understandable and consistent, if not particularly satisfying for the customer.</p>

<p>The vast majority of airlines, however, seem to basically try to avoid the compromise altogether: they <strong>offer</strong> a full deck of dietary combinations, but once you get on the plane, they only actually <strong>provide</strong> regular or vegan.</p>

<p>To me, this seems to be a very strange decision. As a customer, I may be a bit disappointed to be told that I can only choose between regular and fully vegan, but at least my expectations are met. I am definitely going to be a lot more annoyed to be told that I've successfully booked a lacto-ovo meal, only to be given something different when I'm on the flight.</p>

<p>I have limited experience with halal, kosher, etc., but the few times I have travelled with people who booked meals like that, they have gotten special meals—not vegan ones. Conversely, as Itai mentions in the comments, lactose-intolerant people generally get served the vegan meal as well, and I've seen gluten-free bookings go the same way.</p>

<h3>So why do airlines nearly always <em>offer</em> a broad variety of dietary options, including lacto-ovo vegetarian and lactose- and gluten-free, when you book and order your meal; but conflate most non-regular options and only <em>provide</em> a vegan option on the actual flight?</h3>
","<p>What the other answers don't mention is that the special meal types are part of a standardized system developed by the International Air Transport Association (IATA): <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Air_Transport_Association_code#IATA_meal_codes"" rel=""noreferrer"">IATA Meal Codes</a>. These codes are used by airline <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_distribution_system"" rel=""noreferrer"">Global Distribution Systems</a> and the airline Computer Reservation Systems that back them to keep track of passengers with special service requests (there are also codes for passengers who need wheelchair assistance and other special services).</p>

<p>This standardization is important, because it allows for consistency across all the flights on an itinerary. You might be traveling on three different airlines, but you can request a lacto-ovo vegetarian meal (VLML) for your trip, and every airline will know what that means so they can serve you accordingly (in the ideal case where the system all works anyway). Many airlines will trim down the list of choices on their website so as to avoid disappointing people who order a birthday cake (CAKE) and find out the airline doesn't do that, but the actual set of meals that can be ordered in the booking system is anything that appears on the list of codes. There's no part of the system that says ""oh, we don't have the contract catering facility in Beijing make VLML meals, so you can't choose that for this flight."" One flight may offer one, one may not, but everyone uses the same codes.</p>

<p>However, <a href=""http://wildabouttravel.boardingarea.com/2016/06/iata-meal-codes/"" rel=""noreferrer"">every airline doesn't offer every type of special meal</a>, and the meal you receive on a particular flight will depend on the airline, the route, class of service, and the catering facility the airline uses. So when the airline's computer system sees you've ordered a VLML, it instructs the catering facility to give you something that satisfies your criteria, which would include a vegan meal. That is sometimes an airline-wide policy, or it might apply just to flights from that particular station, and you could try to seek out airlines that do not have this policy where possible.</p>

<p>While you view special meals more akin to ordering choices off of a menu, my perception is that airlines see them more of a way of accommodating passengers with a special need. You tell them what your need is (a meal that doesn't contain fish or meat, but is allowed to contain dairy or eggs), and they give you something that fits within those conditions. They're not short order cooks allowing you to choose off a menu, but rather they are satisfying your request for a special accommodation. The list of special needs is larger than the list of available accommodations. </p>

<p>In short, the broad list of choices comes from the industry standard set of special meal choices, but the limited number of actual meals the airline serves comes from their desire to cut costs and simplify their operations. </p>

<p>You could always try to <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/71245/can-i-ask-for-two-meals-for-my-flight-without-paying-extra"">ask the crew if they have any extra non-special meal trays</a>, telling them you don't need the entree. If they have leftover food, you could grab the yogurt or cake or other sides and enjoy them with your vegan meal.</p>

"How do airlines determine ticket prices?","10347","","<p>Based on the question <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/5046/how-to-find-historical-airfares"">How to find historical airfares?</a>, I got curious. Is there a guide or resource that describes how the price of a ticket is determined?</p>

<p>When you search you often see curious effects like cheaper tickets for a flight from A to B with a layover compared to a direct flight. This seems counter-intuitive from an outsider's perspective since you fly twice. Also one way tickets more expensive than 2 ways.</p>

<p>It can be a short set of rules. Something that helps someone to get started with finding good prices. I know these can be very complex and they probably change over time and over airline interests but there is probably a simplified set of rules that can be enunciated.</p>
","<p>To calculate the price of a ticket, we first need to know a little about how air pricing works.</p>

<p>A ticket is a single, complete contract for one journey. It can contain up to a maximum sixteen flights.</p>

<p>Each flight on the ticket must be paid for (""covered"") by exactly one fare. A fare is a price that the airline offers on a city-pair, for example, London-New York, together with a complicated set of rules on how the fare may be used (i.e., the fare rules determine under what conditions that price is valid). Although every flight gets covered by exactly one fare, a single fare could cover multiple flights: For example, a London-New York fare issued by Air France would probably cover London-Paris, and Paris-New York. If you were going as far as Rochester in upstate New York, then the fare would cover London-Paris, Paris-New York, and New York-Rochester, (with the final flight operated by Delta Airlines, but still covered by your Air France fare).</p>

<p>Every carrier publishes a fare tariff, which is just a public list of fares. For example, let us say I want to know what the fare tariff for HKG-SYD [Hong Kong to Sydney] is as sold by QF [Qantas].
This information is distributed to travel agents via a system called the ""GDS"" (global distribution system).</p>

<p>The validity of the tariff varies by sales city, and may change several times a day; although in practise certain fares tend to stay on the tariff for many years with only small changes to their price. The system is not designed to handle changes to the fare tariff more frequently than about once per hour. If my travel agent is located in London and intends to complete ticketing today, the current tariff on HKGSYD published by QF is</p>

<p>(I filtered out non-roundtrip fares.)</p>

<p>You can see there is a long price list. Each fare will have a set of rules in how it can be used, such as—</p>

<ul>
<li>whether the fare can be used to make one-way journeys, round trips, circle trips, round-the-world journeys, or other types of journeys;</li>
<li>whether you must stay at the destination city for a minimum or maximum period of time; </li>
<li>which days of the week and hours of the day travel can occur on;</li>
<li>whether the fare is only valid at certain times of the year or even only on specific dates; </li>
<li>whether you are allowed stopovers at connecting cities on the fare; </li>
<li>whether you must buy the fare in advance of travel, and how far in advance; </li>
<li>whether ticketing must be completed by a certain date (in a sale fare for example);</li>
<li>how long you are allowed to hold reservations on flights under this fare before paying for the ticket;</li>
<li>which flights the fare is valid on, and this may or may not include flights offered by other carriers;</li>
<li>whether and how many transfers are allowed (in the case of indirect
flights); </li>
<li>whether the ticket can be changed or refunded later, and if
so what penalties apply under what conditions; </li>
<li>whether the fare can be combined with other fares and how those combinations can come together (and that could include fares issued by other carriers); </li>
<li>whether unaccompanied minors are allowed, and if so whether a penalty
applies; </li>
<li>whether infants, children or seniors are eligible for a discount;</li>
<li>whether this is a companion fare requiring several people to travel at the same time in the same party;</li>
<li>who is permitted to issue tickets under the fare (some fares can only be issued by the airline and not by travel agents); </li>
<li>whether the fare can be ""printed"" onto another carrier's ticket ""paper"", and the other carrier is therefore trusted to collect payment (even though we now use electronic ticketing, it is a direct implementation of the old analogue concept of paper tickets);</li>
<li>whether a ticket with the fare can be ""endorsed"" onto another carrier offering service on the same route (very rare these days);</li>
<li>and many other conditions ...</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, there are a lot of restrictions and rules possible! By creating these rules very carefully, the carriers intend to keep the price as high as possible but also sell tickets to as many people as possible. For instance, tickets intended to be sold to tourists at low prices will often have to be purchased a few weeks in advance. A consultant who buys his tickets with 2 hours notice will pay a large price for his indecision. It is the flexibility of these rules that make pricing an air ticket a very difficult problem to solve.</p>

<p>To give you a flavour, I will post a subset of the rules from the cheapest fare here. I cannot post the full rules from the fare because it would make my answer far too long! This is QF HKGSYD S50HK3</p>

<p>Right, so you have a fare, now you need some flights to apply it to.</p>

<p>First, better check the fare's routing map, to see what routes the fare actually allows.</p>

<p>Great, so this fare will only cover us travelling directly between HKG and SYD (route number 1) on either QF, CX, IE, or 3K (those four carriers were listed as allowed in the fare rules). If we wanted to go via MEL we would need to get another fare, or maybe a combination of two fares. Some fares give a mileage restriction instead of a route map (so you can use it on any combination of flights [unless restricted by the rules] but only up to a total mileage).</p>

<p>Next we need to have a look at QF flights between HKG and SYD, remembering every flight must satisfy the conditions of the rules given above. (I am going to ignore the possibility we could use this fare to cover CX/IE/3K for brevity.)</p>

<p>The airline helpfully publishes a list of flights onto the GDS together with the number of seats it is presently willing to sell on the flight organized by ""bucket"" or ""booking code"".</p>

<p>This is called the ""availability"". It can differ by sales city again, so a travel agent in NYC might be able to offer you a better price than a travel agent in LON, even for exactly the same journey. Most airlines do not distinguish on point of sale like this, but some do. Legal restrictions apply to this practise within the EU (see Regulation EC 1008/2008).</p>

<p>Anyway, looking on the 1st October, from London, on QF flights between HKG-SYD, there is just one and the availability is:</p>

<pre><code>                                                                     Frequency

                     01/10/15 20:15     02/10/15 7:20                75% / 54m
</code></pre>

<p>The key part is that last block:</p>

<pre><code>  J9 C9 D9 I0 W9 R0 T0 Y5 B0 H0 K0 M0 L0 VC SC NC QC OC XC E0
</code></pre>

<p>It tells you that if your fare allows you to book into ""J"" class, you can reserve 9 seats on this specific flight. There might be more than 9 seats available, the maximum it will display is 9. If your fare lets you book into Y class, you can buy 5 seats in one transaction. If your party is of six people, you will need to pick another fare for the sixth person. (Some booking sites would put everyone in the higher class, at a higher cost for all.) If your fare allows you only to book into M class, alas that has zero seats. If you want a ""confirmed reservation"" right now, you are out of luck.</p>

<p>The letters J, C, D, and I represent business class; W, R, T is premium economy and the rest are economy. The letter at the left is the ""most available"" (and the fares allowing it are the most expensive), gradually getting cheaper but more restricted as we read towards the right. Actually each airline can use their own set of letters, but it is normal that the most-available (""full fare"") business class is J or C, full fare economy is Y and full fare first is F or P. </p>

<p>Now I should emphasise, the numbers there can change by the second. It is not quite ""how many seats are left"". It is an active estimate by the airline of how high they can set the price. Of course, when a seat is bought, it is likely that the availability will decrease. But if demand is unexpectedly weak, it might make sense for the airline to keep the availability open. On the other hand if it is announced that the World Cup is going to be set in Sydney next year, it makes sense to tighten up the availability now and therefore raise the price.</p>

<p>For the airline it is a big problem that a typical purchaser will put hundreds, thousands or probably millions of availability requests through before he purchases a single flight. This has become an intolerable load on the airlines, and therefore the availability information tends to be cached at many levels between the airline and your screen. It can therefore be out of date very quickly.</p>

<p>To make life even more difficult, the airlines often like ""to marry"" segments together, so that the availability on one flight depends on what other flights you propose to take in conjunction with it! Basically, if the airline discovers that you want to take a small but popular flight as part of a big and profitable journey, they can be more liberal in opening up the ""cheap seats"" for you.</p>

<p>Turning back to our ticket buying: when the availability says 0 you may still put in a ""request"" to be added to the waitlist. The airline will decide whether to confirm your reservation at its discretion in its own time. If the reservation is confirmed, you may pay for the ticket at this point. Whether the fare permits waitlisting will be written in the rules. [This dirt cheap fare ""S50HK3"" we are looking at does not allow waitlisting.]</p>

<p>If the fare you intend to use to cover this part of the journey only allows you to sit in S class, then alas that fare bucket (or ""booking code"") has been closed (""C"") to waitlisting: you cannot even ask nicely for a seat.</p>

<p>So which booking code are we allowed to use under our fare? The fare is called ""S50HK3"" so normally that would be the S booking code. In most cases the first letter of the fare name decides the booking code. However, there can be exceptions for specific flights [most obvious example: if you had a first class fare but not all planes have first class], and to be sure we need to check the Booking Codes table attached to the fare.</p>

<p>Okay so we should use the S code. Alas! The S bucket is closed. So now we go back to the beginning and pick the next cheapest fare on the list.</p>

<p>Once we have done this we will need to repeat the process with the return trip. And then we need to ensure the two fares are mutually compatible with each other.</p>

<p>As you can see, pricing an airfare is a complicated business and requires a lot of work. This was a very simple example of a round trip fare. When you get into multicities, where for example, because of ""stopovers"", several cities might be covered by one fare, or you need to use fares from multiple carriers: it can be computationally very difficult to compute the lowest allowed price. People like <a href=""http://www.itasoftware.com"">http://www.itasoftware.com</a> make a lot of money designing algorithms to compute the lowest price.</p>

<p>I should emphasize that actually this is a problem for the airlines too. They have over the years created a system which is so complex that they cannot predict it perfectly either. This is why ""error fares"" remain quite common. There is also a lot of inertia in this system. It is used by hundreds of airlines and millions of travel agents, and is written into huge computer systems worth billions of dollars. It cannot be changed easily.</p>

<p>While you will need a good travel agent sometimes, most of this is actually done these days by websites that sit on top of this 1980s interface. So thousands of these calculations are done every time you want to find out a price for a simple trip.</p>

<p>All the time the ""availability"" (those numbers we saw at the end) is being constantly manipulated by the airlines to keep the price at the right level to keep the flight maximally profitable.</p>

<p>It is my intention to demonstrate here, as well as giving a flavour of how it works, that pricing an airfare is a difficult mathematical problem to solve. Indeed, it has been proven that, strictly speaking, the problem is ""undecidable"", that is to say, it is mathematically impossible to design an algorithm that will always find the lowest allowable price under every circumstance.</p>

<p>Many people suggest that the price of a journey automatically rises when you compare several fares. But you can see from my description above that this would be technologically challenging to implement to say the least. (It would probably also be illegal.) In practise, is more likely that the availability is being miscomputed or cached somewhere between the airline and your screen.</p>

"In what language should I address foreign customs and immigration?","10315","","<p>I'm an American traveling to Central America for the first time this summer. I'll be entering Costa Rica and Panama. </p>

","<p>Unless you're completely fluent, you risk a miscommunication in a legal context.  If you're at all uncertain about communicating to them, you should ask for a translator.</p>

<p>In your case, if you're confident, there's no harm in addressing them, but if they address you first in your language (I'm presuming English), it's best to stick with that rather than changing.  Your goal should generally be to only speak when spoken to, and to keep the conversation to a minimum.  It's more efficient for them, and prevents confusion overall.</p>

"Getting around to transfer in huge airports if you don't know English","10312","","<p>How can someone who doesn't know any international language get around in huge airports, if they need to transfer?</p>

<p>I'm asking this because my mother-in-law wants to travel half the world to visit us, from Europe to New Zealand. She can't avoid at least two transfers in big international airports. She cannot speak any international language and is not willing to start learning English. She's afraid she will get lost, even if usually there are signs everywhere, and they always use pictograms.</p>

<p>The only advice she got from the travel agency is to use disability services. She could get away with that, because though she had a car accident three years ago and still hasn't completely recovered, in truth this would be abuse.
She should have a phone and call us for translation.</p>

<p>Do you have any other suggestions?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>The only advice she got from the travel agency is to use disability
  services.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not disability services, but you can use the meet and assist services from the airline that are provided to minors. The same service is available for elderly travelers and those needing extra assistance. This would make sure someone receives her at the gate, takes her through the terminal, and places her at the priority queue for the next flight.</p>

<p>The other thing you can do for her is minimize her transit points. Try to find a route that has at max one stop.  You didn't mention where in Europe you would be starting from, but I would recommend Emirates; not only do they have a large multi-lingual cabin staff (they also make sure that there is staff speaking the destination language on their long distance flights) and as she would be transiting through Terminal 3 (dedicated to Emirates) it reduces the chance of getting lost at that terminal.</p>

<p>Some other things to consider is the stay at the transit point. For example, try to get her a meal voucher in case she needs to snack at the terminal (these are available from the airlines).</p>

<p>At most shops they can charge you in the local currency or a major currency; also if you pay in cash (very rare, but happens) they will reimburse you in the local currency.</p>

<p>All this can be daunting for someone that has a language barrier.</p>

"Will my USA iPhone work outside the USA?","10286","","<p>We are planning to be in New Zealand for 10 months starting in August and currently are under contract with Verizon here in the USA.</p>

<p>I am thinking about suspending my Verizon account and getting local service in New Zealand.   The other option would be to switch to T-Mobile that has global roaming data.</p>

<p>Will our iPhones work in New Zealand?  Data is probably the most important part for us.</p>
","<p>This is very much related to your phone and to a certain extent your provider. It is especially important for Verizon customers because their network is different to most of the world (CDMA vs. GSM) and hence the phones they sold often only worked on their network, unless they were marketed as 'world phones'. You should also consider the frequencies supported (Verizon and T-Mobile use different frequency bands to most of the world). </p>

<p>In this case though, the iPhone 5s is a 'world phone'. Looking at the specs (<a href=""http://www.apple.com/iphone-5s/specs/"">http://www.apple.com/iphone-5s/specs/</a>),</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>... you can see that the CDMA models (you should be able to confirm this in Settings>General>About>Model) support UMTS/HSPA+ (the 3G technologies in use in NZ) and GSM/EDGE (the 2G technologies in use in NZ).</p>

<p>The frequencies in use in NZ are -</p>

<p>2 Degrees (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2degrees#Network"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2degrees#Network</a>) - </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3G (UMTS) - 2100 Mhz (urban) and 900 Mhz (rural)</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The frequencies match up to the ones supported on your iPhone, so therefore you should be fine on any of the mobile networks and you should get at least 3G data performance in urban areas, if not 4G. You might fall back to 2G on some networks outside urban areas.</p>

<p>Verizon has also previously stated that they do not carrier-lock the SIM slot on iPhones, so you should be free to use other SIM cards abroad (see <a href=""http://9to5mac.com/2012/09/24/verizon-iphone-5-wont-ever-be-locked-most-likely-due-to-the-fcc/"">http://9to5mac.com/2012/09/24/verizon-iphone-5-wont-ever-be-locked-most-likely-due-to-the-fcc/</a>, but do check with them first though).</p>

<p>Finally, do consider the T-Mobile global roaming option, however I believe that only allows you to roam for 3 out of the previous 6 months or something like that, to prevent people from signing up and permanently using it abroad. I don't have any recommendations as to which network you should sign up for, but note that the 2 degrees network is only available within urban areas; outside urban areas, it falls back on to the Vodafone network and you may lose data access (although calling and SMS should be fine).</p>

"Can you get frequent flyer miles from all code-share airlines, or only same alliance ones?","10285","","<p>For example, Qantas and British Airways are both One World. If you fly with one, you can usually claim miles with the other (except some award seats).</p>

<p>What about China Eastern Airlines, who code-shares with Qantas, but has their own Eastern Miles program?</p>
","<p>The key in Star Alliance is ""operated by"". For example, at one time SAA was not in *A. Lufthansa operated some flights from Europe to JNB, and code-shared others on SAA. As an Air Canada Aeroplan collector, I would get *A miles if I flew on an LH plane, and not if I flew on an SAA plane. This is kind of moot now that SAA joined *A, but the point still holds for other combinations.</p>

<p>Now, when you're looking at a site like Expedia that shows you a wide variety of flights, they will typically tell you who operates it. When you go to your own airline and ask for a multi-leg thing, for example asking Air Canada for YYZ-FRA-JNB, it can be hard to know who is actually operating the non-Air Canada leg. (Substitute your own airlines and cities as appropriate.) The answer is <strong>usually</strong> that it is the airline that uses a 3-digit flight number for it. If they tell you the leg is on LH8765 then it is probably not a LH plane; but LH876 probably is. (I say usually because for example Air Canada and United both have some 4-digit flight numbers that are operated by their LCC divisions - Jazz and United Express - but that are treated exactly the same as if they were operated by the mainline carrier.)</p>

<p>Now before you pull your hair out, remember that usually, it doesn't even matter because the operator and all the codeshares are all in the same alliance. It only becomes relevant if you happen to know that some of the codeshare partners on the route are not in the alliance.</p>

<p>To be sure, I will often do a ""wide spectrum"" search for the flight I'm considering, to let them show me the operating carrier so that I can then check my own plan to see what I will get. It's reasonably difficult to be confident - you have to understand all the fare classes on both your own airline and the operating airline. But you can learn this if you need to and want to.</p>

","<p>I remember reading a piece about these recently enough that I thought it was on here. Evidently not.  Anyway, there are brands like Vapestick, which at least on their website state that it's legal to use them onboard.  I assume they'd get sued to infinity and beyond if that wasn't true, by now.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.vapestick.co.uk/electronic-cigarettes-on-planes.html"">From their website</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While it isn't illegal to smoke electronic cigarettes on planes, it
  could definitely raise questions or cause other passengers to be
  alarmed, so you will need to approach the situation carefully if you

<p>However, further down the same page they also note that despite it not being illegal, many airlines do BAN it, so it's best to check with your airline first.</p>

  <p>Electronic cigarettes on planes are banned by some airlines operating
  in the US. In the UK, you can still get away with it in most cases,

  smoke in the rest room.</p>

<p>I followed G &amp; Doc's advice and walked over to the Sofitel Hotel (Immigration + walk ~20-25 min total) showered there for £25 and walked back through Security with plenty of time to spare.</p>

<p>Thank you all for your help!</p>
","<p>Within Terminal 5 itself, until very recently only showers are inside the various British Airways lounges. As of August 2015, there are no public showers, however there is now a paid-for lounge available, the Aspire Lounge. The bulk of the showers are in BA lounges.</p>

<p>If you qualify for BA lounge access (through OneWorld status of Business/First tickets), you'll find showers at:</p>

<ul>
<li>T5 Galleries North - inside the lounge, go into the main area of the lounge then turn left, they're about half way down on your left. Recently refurbished</li>
<li>T5 Lounges South - part of the Elemis travel spa on the 1st level, ask the Spa staff near the entrance to the CCR to allocate you a shower</li>
<li>T5 B - inside the lounge, part of the Elemis travel spa within the lounge, again ask the spa staff</li>
<li>T5 Arrivals - landside, morning only, largely inbound business passengers only</li>
</ul>

<p>To get BA Lounge access, your options are:</p>

<ul>
<li>BA Executive Club Silver or Gold</li>
<li>OneWorld frequent traveller at Emerald or Saphire (but <em>not</em> Ruby)</li>
<li>Same day OneWorld arrival from long haul Business or First (show inbound boarding pass)</li>
<li>Same day OneWorld departure in Business or First (show boarding pass)</li>
</ul>

<p>Assuming you don't have status, that means you need to book one of your legs into Business. Check with your travel agent, it may not be too much to do so at booking time. Otherwise, BA sometimes offer cheap upgrade deals, especially in cases when the flight is looking full down the back. Keep an eye on Manage My Booking to see if it pops up, otherwise ask at checkin for a paid-for upgrade. It isn't available on every flight, and it isn't available every day, but it's worth checking just in case.</p>

<p>As of August 2015, there's now also a paid-for lounge, the Aspire Lounge. It's located near the BA south lounges, near gate A18. You can buy entry for £40, on the door or in advance, or you can enter with a Priority Pass (though not most other lounge cards). If you enter with a Priority Pass it's £20 extra (!) for the shower, not sure on a paid-entry, or if you can just pay £20 on the door for a shower. Based on <a href=""http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/british-airways-executive-club/1699808-aspire-lounge-spa-paid-lounge-lhr-t5-information-photographs-reviews.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this very thorough review from the ever-great CWS on FlyerTalk</a>, they have a ""few"" shower suites available.</p>

<p>Otherwise, your main alternative is to go landside, and have a fair bit of time. You'd need to clear UK Immigration, enter the UK, walk through baggage claim and UK customs, take walk / a bus to a nearby hotel. Most of the Heathrow area hotels offer Day Use room rates, which will get you a room during the day, in which you can shower, change, doze etc. A handful offer cheaper ""spa"" or ""sports"" pacakge, the former getting you access to their spas for eg shower+massage, the latter tend more to be gym + shower access. You may need to ring the hotels to book most of those, though a website like <a href=""https://www.between9and5.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Between 9 and 5</a> can help you book day-use rooms. For these options, tou need to be able to enter the UK, and allow several hours to get through, go to the hotel, shower, return, re-clear security etc. While lots of hotels near the airport offer day rooms, the cost might work out being similar to upgrading one leg to business when you factor in the bus fare or taxi! (To a certain extent, the further from the airport, the cheaper the day use rate)</p>

<p>In terms of how long it would take if you go to a landside hotel, arriving early morning you'll be hitting immigration just at the same time as a lot of large planes come in, so the EU lines can be slow, and the non-EU lines pretty dire. Gate to landside would probably be 45-60 minutes at that time of day for non-EU. You need to be back through security 35 minutes before. Given your timings, that won't leave enough to get to a hotel on Bath Road (where the cheaper hotels are), check in to a day room, shower, check out and get back to the airport. Your only option would really be the Sofitel, which is directly attached to the Terminal. It's a very nice hotel, but not a very cheap one... I can't see their day room rates on their website, so you'd need to <a href=""http://www.sofitel.com/gb/hotel-6214-sofitel-london-heathrow/index.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">ring them and ask</a> / see if <a href=""https://www.between9and5.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Between 9 and 5 have it listed</a> that day. I've heard rumours that they may also sell access to their gym/fitness centre, which would let you freshen up for a lot less than the cost of a day room, but again no prices on their website so you'd need to ring for that too.</p>

<p>Can you someone please elaborate on the complete procedure of booking luggage?
Since the train is scheduled to depart in the early morning (7.35 AM IST), when should I reach there and book the luggage?</p>

<p>Thanks for in advance for sharing your knowledge. </p>
","<p>There are two ways you can do this :</p>

<p>Parcel booking  and Luggage booking</p>

<p><strong>Parcel booking</strong> : I am not sure how they (Indian railways) came up with those terms but those are the two ways you can do this. Parcel booking can be done by going to your nearest station and filling a parcel form and you leave your goods there and you can expect it to reach your destination within five to seven days. To receive your goods you have to go to the destination railways station and present your receipt. You wont be traveling on the same train and it costs a bit extra as compared to luggage booking. Another important thing to note is parcel bookings can only be done during office hours on working days.</p>

<p><strong>Luggage booking</strong> : This is what you want as you are planning to travel with your luggage on the same train. You should ideally reach the railway station at least three hours before the train departure (better to have time on your side). There are security checks and those guys are ""slow"" so keep that in mind.Recent Uri attack may have heightened security.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.indiatravelforum.in/threads/luggage-transport-by-indian-railway.2081/""><strong>How to book your luggage</strong></a>:</p>

<p><strong>Requirements</strong> - Government issued ID, train ticket and reservation for the same train as you want to book luggage in.</p>

<p><strong>Procedure to book luggage</strong> - Go to the station a day before your journey and fill out the luggage booking form. The reason you should go a day before is to make sure you have a booking in case the brake van gets filled up and you wont have any options left.</p>

<p>On the day of your journey reach the station at least three hours before of more. Go to the parcel office and present your booking receipt and they will transport your luggage to the platform for you. They will also load your luggage when train is ready.</p>

<p>On reaching the destination you would need to ""run"" to the parcel office and present your receipt and they will then offload your luggage.Some stations are proactive and you wont have to worry about it but my advise is to get to the parcel counter as soon as you can. Parcel office will also issue you a gate pass which you would need to present at the gate while exiting with your luggage.</p>

<p>After some hunting on Wikipedia I found that there are only three non-virtual operators in the country; I've since then started crawling the respective websites for information. Obviously, the operators all want to fish me for a 2-year subscription plan with smart phones and whatnot, while I ""only"" need a SIM card.</p>

<p>When those pages do give information about tariffs, they don't usually tell the full story either, and e.g. if I were to get tricked into getting a KPN sim card, I'd be paying €0.35/minute per national calls. You have to dig deeper to find out the plans costs <a href=""http://www.kpn.com/prive/mobiel/Tarieven/prepaid-1.htm""><em>€2.5/MB</em> for data</a>, and <a href=""http://www.kpn.com/prive/mobiel/Tarieven/buitenland.htm""><em>€1.16/minute</em></a> for calls to Italy. Whoa.</p>

<p>On the other hand there are too-good-to-be-true offers like <a href=""http://www.t-mobile.nl/prepaid/internationaal/tarieven/engels"">this one from T-Mobile</a>, promising €0.24 (fixed cost for 30 minutes... per call? cumulative? who knows!) domestic calls plus €0.19 + €0.09/minute calls to Italy which <em>has</em> to have a horrible catch hidden somewhere in the small print of the Dutch-only contract.</p>

","<p>First off, I would use Skype, Google Voice (through GMail outside the US) or any other VOIP-like provider. They offer a tariff of ~2c/min and ~30c/min (mobile) for calling to Italian numbers. Obviously if the other person has Skype, you only pay for the internet connection. Your only problem then would be to get an affordable prepaid mobile data plan unless you can manage to only call to Italy from the University and your dorm.</p>

<p>Virtual providers, at least in the Netherlands, are a perfect option. Some like Ben (T-Mobile) or Hi and Telfort (KPN) are simply 'budget' brands of their subsidiary, so there's nothing wrong with them.</p>

<p>As for comparing mobile phone or data plans, the Dutch site comparison site to go to is <a href=""http://www.bellen.com""><strong>bellen.com</strong></a>. Which is an independent site and compares all the important providers (even some of the large virtual ones). Lucky for you, <a href=""http://www.bellen.com/bellen-naar-het-buitenland/italie.aspx"">they even have a page with affordable calling options to Italy.</a> They list a range of prepaid options, where the cheapest one is 20 c/min and a couple that are slightly more expensive and also charge a starting tariff.</p>

<p>Another alternative is calling through 0900-numbers, which can be significantly cheaper. However, when calling them from a mobile phone, you'll be charged with the minutes you're calling and whatever the 0900-number charges. Some options would allow you to call to a mobile number in Italy <a href=""http://www.bellen.com/vaste-telefonie/bellen-via-0900-nummers/italie.aspx?aantalminuten=10"">for 10 minutes for only less than 1 euro.</a></p>

<p>If you need a mobile data plan (because you plan to use Skype or email) it should be possible to get a 2Gb data plan for 30 euro/month. In that case, I would either pick a very cheap prepaid number to call in the Netherlands itself and use mobile internet to connect with everyone else.</p>

"What's the quickest way from London Kings Cross to Euston, by foot or tube?","10237","","<p>My train to London Kings Cross has just been cancelled, so instead of having plenty of time to make a connection to Euston, I'm going to have a mad dash...</p>

<p>To get from Kings Cross to Euston I have a number of options, but given that my train ticket includes an Underground journey, I'm thinking that either walking (fast!) or tube would be my best bet. Given the tight connection, I'm after the fastest way to do it. What would that be?</p>

<p>Based on <a href=""http://stations.aeracode.org/#kxx"">this 3D model of Kings Cross / St Pancras underground station</a>, I see that none of the underground lines are that close to the Northern Ticket hall where my later train will come into. At the Euston end, I know that Euston Square station is quite a fair way from Euston station itself, which the Victoria or Northern Lines are quite deep so there'd be walking + escalators to get up to the surface (plus the <a href=""http://stations.aeracode.org/#kxx"">long walk+escalator</a> at the KX end to get to them). Walking wise, not sure which is the quickest way to go, but I suspect it wouldn't necessarily be the ""obvious"" one along Euston Road.</p>

<p>So, which is the quickest way - tube (if so which) or fast walk (if so which way)?</p>
","<p>I also vote for walking.  You can save a little bit of time by being in the right part of the train, and then by avoiding a couple of annoyingly slow pedestrian crossings:</p>

<ul>
<li>Travel in the frontmost carriage if you can; that'll put you closest to the ticket barriers at Kings Cross.  Get up and go to the doors as the train approaches the station.  You want to get ahead of the crowd (you don't want to get stuck in a massive queue for the ticket gates when you're in a rush).</li>
<li>When you get to Kings Cross, go to the Departures Concourse, head for platforms 9-11, and go out of the doors you'll find right by them.</li>
<li>Cross Pancras Road outside there (there's a crossing to the right, past the taxi rank).  You'll get across much faster at that part of the road than at the end where it meets Euston Road.</li>
<li>Enter St Pancras through the big glass doors and walk straight through, taking a path parallel to Euston Road.</li>
<li>You'll come out on Midland Road.  Cross that straight away too.  Now turn left and head towards Euston Road.</li>
<li>The British Library's on your right as you approach Euston Road, and you can cut through its courtyard if you like; it won't save you much time but it's pretty and uncrowded.</li>
<li>Stick to Euston Road for the rest of the journey.</li>

"Is it easy to get prepaid SIMs in the US/Canada?","10235","","<p>I'll be travelling in a family party to the east coast of the US and Canada and, as most people know, travelling in a party means you often need to keep in contact when seeing different things and trying to meet up, etc.  We were wondering if it's easy to get prepaid SIMs for our (Australian) phones and use them while we were over there?  </p>

<p>Are there any catches to be aware of?  Can the same SIMs be used for Canada (Toronto) and the US, or should we just restrict ourselves to US-only ones?  What about data quotas for smart phones?</p>
","<p>The US and Canada are two different countries, and as such, has different providers for internet, cellphones and data connections.</p>

<p>If you have a sim card from one and travel to the other, it'll cost you roaming charges.</p>

<p>It's easy enough to acquire SIM cards - you go to a shop and buy one over the counter.  I found it tricky at first in Canada, but I feel that's because I dealt with an unhelpful Rogers staff member.  We have a question on that, fortunately..</p>

<p>As such, you'll want to take a look at the following questions for further information:</p>

<p>It of course depends on how much you're going to use them.

<li>More baggage (3 bags of up to 32kg each!)</li>
<li>Escorts through security at the ""more chaotic"" outstations</li>
<li>Nicer lounge almost everywhere, generally with self-pour champagne and some menu ordering of food</li>
<li>Very nice lounges (Concorde Club Room) in Heathrow and JFK, which are basically a half decent restaurant (menus, proper tables, service etc)</li>
<li>You can book into the Elemis travel spa in advance (Heathrow/JFK)</li>
<li>Quick entry to the lounge after security (Heathrow), avoiding the need to traipse through the shops to get to the lounge</li>
<li>You can bring one guest into the lounge with you (business it's just yourself)</li>
<li>Nicer welcome drink on board</li>
<li>YouFirst </li>
</ul>

<p>In the air:</p>

<ul>
<li>Larger seat</li>

"How far into Washington, DC should I drive before taking the Metro?","10215","","<p>I plan to drive to Washington, DC, but my understanding is that the Metro is far better than driving for actually getting around downtown DC.  First of all, is that assumption correct?</p>

<p>Assuming the Metro is indeed the way I should ultimately get to my downtown destination, how close should I drive before finding a Metro station?  Should I stop at the first one on the outskirts in Maryland, or should I keep going into the city a bit?  I'm primarily concerned with avoiding traffic if possible as well as generally shortening my travel time.  The travel will be occurring during a weekend (4th of July weekend) in case that is relevant.  My destination in DC is off the Navy Yard station of the Metro Green Line.</p>

<p><strong>Follow-up</strong>: I might have found a last-minute hotel deal downtown.  Can I park <strong>overnight</strong> at the Metro stations that are being suggested?</p>
","<p>I lived in DC/Northern VA area for the past four years. I can tell you riding Metro in the city is the way to go. Traffic in DC is very bad and on top of that the roads can be very very confusing for visitors. The worst part is probably the parking. During prime tourist hours, it's almost impossible to find one.</p>

<p>I don't know which part of Maryland you'll be becoming from. If you're coming from the Red Line (Shade Grove) area, then I recommend driving to the Bethesda station and park there. If you're coming from Red Line (Glenmont) area, I recommend parking at the Silver Spring station. </p>

<p>The stations in the suburbs have parking lots(they charge by the hours, or a maximum of $5ish per day), where as most of the ones inside of DC don't. </p>

<p>If you plan to do some sightseeing in the city, check out the official <a href=""http://wmata.com/rail/maps/map.cfm"">DC Metro map</a></p>

<p>Most of the tourist spots are Metro accesible. You can also check out all the metro stations wrt to the tourust spots on <a href=""http://bit.ly/jxQL7z"">Google Map</a></p>

<p>There are different types of Metro cards you can get. </p>

<p><a href=""http://wmata.com/fares/smartrip/"">SmarTrip card</a>: works like a plastic credit card. you can buy these at MD/VA grocery stores. You start with a $20 value, and can add more $ to it later.</p>

","<p>The stamp on your ticket is so poor, that it is really difficult to read. It does indeed say Aug 27th, but it can very easily be read as Aug 21st:</p>

<p>The stamp actually reads 'P27Ⅷ17', but the uppermost line of all characters is missing, so it could even easily be misread as 21st July (21Ⅶ). The last digit (7) is so weakly printed, that you can barely see it. Even on your stamp, it is pretty obvious that the digits before and after the Ⅷ are different.</p>

<p>If you look at the font used by the Prague ticket validators and the digits 1 and 7 properly printed, you can see that if the upper horizontal line of a '7' digit is missing, there is only the rightmost vertical bar left, which can easily be read as a '1'. The digit '1' is however printed with a horizontal bar at the bottom, with a vertical line rising from the center. </p>

<p>To avoid such situations, you could have seen yourself that the stamp is very hard to read. Depending on wether you want to waste time or money to solve the problem, you could either have made an attempt to replace the ticket at a ticket office, or bought a new ticket and stamped it in a different validator. The problem had likely been solved if you had let the ticket inspectors take you to the police, but you might have lost even more time.</p>

"What is the cheapest available freighter voyage anywhere?","10164","","<p>Walking past a huge international shipyard twice today got me thinking about <a href=""http://wikitravel.org/en/Freighter_travel"">freighter travel</a>. We have a couple of such questions on the site, but not many.</p>

<p>Many people are surprised when they find out that freighter travel is often more expensive than flying and I just looked at the website of the Australian company ""Freighter Expeditions"" and found most of the trips listed even more expensive than I was expecting.</p>

<p>But this surely isn't the only company / website dealing in freighter travel - I just don't know where else to look?</p>

<p>My question is <strong>""What is the cheapest freighter travel trip available anywhere in the world?""</strong></p>
","<p>I have been wondering about that as well and here is what I could find.</p>

<p>I read about trips with several major container ship operators (CMA-CGM, Hanjin Shipping, MSC, NSB) plus some roros and Polish bulkers. I also found many agencies selling more-or-less the same trips (a few in Germany, one each in France, the US, Australia and the UK). In all cases, the prices were around EUR 80-110 per day, plus deviation insurance and embarkation fees (which are more-or-less fixed costs, so they weigh much more heavily on short journeys).</p>

<p>Those are the only companies I have heard of that verifiably take passengers on a regular basis and they all have pretty similar prices/conditions. Thus any trip across the Atlantic or Pacific, to or from Asia or Oceania or through the Suez canal will cost at least €2000-3000, sometimes much more and circumnavigations start at €10,000.</p>

<p>Consequently, it seems the price does not depend so much on the ship, the agency or the operator but mostly on the route/length of the voyage. At EUR 100 per day, ocean crossings or longer journeys will always cost a few thousands euros/dollars. Voyages to or from Australia and New Zealand also seem in particularly high demand.</p>

<p>The only other option seems to be shorter “partial” journeys, hopping on and off a ship doing a longer rotation. Nothing dirt cheap and certainly nothing cheaper than a commercial flight but still some opportunities to travel on a freighter for less than EUR 900/USD 1000. Some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Partial journeys on <a href=""http://www.grimaldi-freightercruises.com/freighter/italia/medItaliano.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Grimaldi Lines' “Euromed” roro tours</a>, for example Salerno (Italy) to Setubal (in Portugal) or Salerno to Limassol (Cyprus) or Ashdod (Israel). Salerno-Setubal is €285 per person in an internal cabin with a double bed or €315 in a cabin with three single beds (but I think you have to find your travel companions yourself and book the entire cabin together, unlike couchettes on trains). That's the absolute cheapest price I came across. Some agencies also list the Italy-Cyprus trip, usually with a small markup.</li>
<li>Rotterdam-UK and return (no one-way journey) on a container ship, €345 per person through <a href=""http://zylmann.de/index.php?id=40&amp;no_cache=1&amp;tx_ticzylmannpassage_pi1%5Bdetail%5D=950"" rel=""nofollow"">Kapitän Zylmann</a> (price includes insurance and admin fees).

"Can I travel to Canada with valid visa on old/expired passport?","10164","","<p>I recently renewed my passport. I also have an expired passport which has my Canada visa (visitor's) valid for another three years. I have already used my Canadian visa which is multiple entry. I am planning to visit Canada this summer.</p>

<p>Since my valid Canadian visa is in my old/expired passport, do I need to renew/transfer my Canada visa or can I simply travel with valid visa in old passport?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Do I need to renew/transfer my canada visa or can I simply travel with
  valid visa on old passport?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don't need to transfer your valid Canadian visa on your fresh passport. You can simply attach your old passport with your new one and can travel to Canada. Answer is from official <a href=""http://www.cic.gc.ca/ENGLISH/resources/manuals/enf/enf04-eng.pdf"">Immigration And Citizenship EN4 Port Of Entry Examinations</a>:</p>

<p><strong>13.18 Valid visas in expired passports</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Visa officers will not put a visa in an expired document and will not
  issue a visa for a period surpassing the expiry date of the passport
  or travel document. Occasionally, documents containing valid visas are
  cancelled or replaced. <strong>If a valid visa inside an expired document is
  presented at the POE along with a valid passport or travel document,
  the visa is considered valid.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore you will be fine and can simply travel to Canada with valid Canadian visa on old passport along with a valid new passport.</p>

"Bringing coins back home from abroad; Is that unethical to do?","10162","","<p>I have a bad habit of not properly utilizing foreign currency coins when I tour any country. When I pay in bills and get back coins I don't know why my brain is programmed to think of them as <em>change</em> and for the next purchase I would again use a new bill.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is also due to the fact that I don't like to spend a long time on a counter trying to count coins up to a certain amount so just to make it easy for me I would just pay with a currency note that's slightly bigger than the required amount, or use a combination etc. It is also due to the fact that sometimes its hard to get used to the denominations specially for coins on a short trip; they sure do some in various shapes and sizes, whereas on for paperback it is comparatively easier.</p>

<p>I usually bring all those coins back home, they are quite a bunch of them by the end of a trip. I bring them home as a memory or as something that relates to my trip for a long time to come. I am not a coin collector but sometimes when I see that this coin that I have is from a country which i visited when i was a child it makes me feel good. Sometimes my family members take some of them as souvenirs.</p>

<p>The only time I use those coins abroad is on vending machines and lately in theme parks for my kid on toys which operate with coins.</p>

<p>Lately I have been reading about this fairly global practice that all coins should either be used at the airport or given to homeless people in that country before you fly out.</p>

<p>That has got me wondering whether what I do is unethical? I am not a miser nor do I have any use for those coins when I reach home but even when I find a homeless person abroad I give them a currency note instead of a coin.</p>

<p>Is this a bad practice?</p>
","<p>I don't personally think there are any ethical issues with taking change away.  One good reason for doing so is to land with a little change next time you visit; I find it quite handy to have a couple of quarters in my pocket when I land in the US, just in case I need to make a small purchase from a vending machine, or a call from a payphone.  Visitors to the UK, where a pound coin is very often used as a return-to-stand deposit on luggage (and shopping) trolleys, would probably find similar utility in a little pocket change.</p>

<p>But if you do feel bad about this, and you ever fly BA, they're still running their <a href=""http://www.britishairways.com/travel/15-years/public/en_gb#"">Change for Good</a> scheme with UNICEF; you put all your change in the envelope in the seat back, hand it to the cabin crew, and they get it to UNICEF who use it for the great good that they do.  No doubt some other airlines have similar programmes, and I've noticed that some banks in the UK, particularly in tourist areas, have charity collecting boxes for foreign coinage.</p>

<p>As a passing note (hah!), I'd mention that in many countries, where the lowest denomination note is still fairly valuable (eg, the smallest note in the UK is worth about USD8), the practice of using notes for everything and disregarding change can get both expensive and heavy quite quickly.  One visitor of ours, from the US, bemoaned how expensive things were in the UK.  That's not a novel observation for US visitors, but he seemed particularly upset; when we did a bit of digging, we found a pile of change by his bed, with over <strong>£120</strong> in it, which he had mentally discarded as ""worthless"".  I don't think he spent anything but coins for the rest of his trip; you may find that a re-examination of your every-transaction's-a-note policy reaps dividends, here.</p>

"How should I wash clothes in Japan?","10160","","<p>I'm going backpacking for a month in Japan and I plan to pack lightly. So I have couple of questions about how I can wash my clothes in Japan. </p>

<p>I expect laundromats to be quite common in big cities but what about little towns in rural area (for example, Hokkaido)?</p>

<p>I'm used to washing my clothes in hot water, but I've read that clothes are washed in cold water in Japan. How different is from what I'm used to? Do I have to use different detergents and/or in a different way?</p>

<li>(google for コインランドリー 店舗一覧 to find more)</li>
</ul>

<p>In terms of washing, there is nothing to worry about. Everything works just as fine as hot water and pretty much the same. I found <a href=""http://econutssoap.com/laundry-science-101-hot-water-vs-cold-water/"">this article</a> that says that you can compensate for the temperature by <strong>either</strong> longer washing <strong>or</strong> stronger chemicals. I am not 100% certain what the norm is in Japan. I would google translate the most important terms though or ask someone who speaks english to come with you the first time. I would not expect anyone in these shops to speak english or any of the buttons on the machine to be english.</p>

<p>The only thing is that Japanese detergent usually are not smelling ""nice"". They have a rather chemical smell. It seems that Japanese consumers relate a chemical detergent smell more to ""clean"" than something flowery. </p>

<p>Should I get a new passport or can I save some money and time and use this one? It expires only in 2019.</p>
","<p>Let's assume the USA will use the same standards to evaluate a damaged US passport as it will use to evaluate a damaged foreign passport. Well, this is what <a href=""https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/passports/FAQs.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the USA says about damaged US passports</a> which you can use as a guide:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If your passport has been significantly damaged, especially the book
  cover or the page displaying your personal data and photo, you will
  need to apply for a new passport.  Damage that might require you to
  replace your passport includes water damage, a significant tear,
  unofficial markings on the data page, missing visa pages (torn out), a
  hole punch, or other injuries.</p>
  
  <p>Normal ""wear and tear"" of a U.S. passport is expected and likely does
  not count as ""damage.""  For instance normal wear includes the bend of
  a passport after being carried in your back pocket or fanning of the
  visa pages after extensive opening and closing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How much do you save by waiting till 2019? That's 2 years. If you have a passport normally valid for 10 years, that's only 20% savings. For a $80 passport, that is $16 of savings. Is it worth getting denied boarding, getting your visa application rejected etc? The numbers I use are only assumptions.</p>

<p>I am a person who so far has been traveling within Europe and the middle East, so far without any kind of lock. My luggage typically is clothing and things of lesser value (think gadgets); I carry phones and computers in the carry-on. </p>

<p>I'm staying in the US for a year now and learned about this whole business of having traveling locks such that there even exist TSA approved ones that they can open without damaging the lock (read: locks are apparently a big thing over the ocean). </p>

<ol>
<li>TSA (and anyone who cares) has a master key which will open it.</li>
<li>The locks are very light weight, and easy to break.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, in my opinion, a TSA-approved lock is good for exactly one thing: Slowing someone down who might try to get into your bag <em>in your presence</em>. That is to say, on a bus, or train, or in the airport.</p>

<p>Once your bag is out of your possession, such a lock won't protect you from anyone except a theoretical honest thief who is willing to steal your items, but unwilling to break your lock.</p>

Are ATMs available and reliable outside of the main cities? Do they charge commission? Or is it better to have cash? What currency is best? Does the exchange rate depend on the nominal and visual state of the banknote?</p>
","<p>What I did for my three months long backpacking trip is that I brought 500 Euros in cash and exchanged it on my first, second day. I probably shouldn't have done that as the exchange rate got significantly better in the next few weeks.</p>

<p>I also had rest of my money on my (Croatian) bank account and had my Visa debit card with me. Along with this card, I have a card for my foreign currency account just in case.</p>

<p>On top of all that, I have an Amex credit card for more expensive stuff and it proved useful when I had to buy plane ticket after I missed one of my flights.</p>

<p>And now to answer your exact questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>There are ATMs available in bigger cities but sometimes you have to walk for some 10-15 minutes to find the one that you prefer. I prefer <a href=""http://www.axisbank.com"">AXIS Bank</a> ATMs as I only get charged little over 200 rupees per withdrawal and on other ATMs I get charged around 420 rupees.</li>
<li>In smaller cities and villages there is usually one or two ATMs, but that's usually in smaller tourist places and not in some ""off-the-beaten-path"" places. There, I would imagine, are no ATMs at those places.</li>
<li>I have no idea whether I am charged by my bank or I pay the ATM fee but I do know that countries like USA, UK, Germany etc. (Croatia doesn't have one) have banks that charge no commission and you only pay the amount charged by an Indian bank at the ATM.</li>
<li>You cannot withdraw money in a bank with your Visa card, you have to use an ATM.</li>
<li>Maximum amount that you can withdraw in one turn is 10,000 rupees which is not that much considering you are still charged that 200-400 rupee amount for each withdrawal.</li>
<li>For you question about the preferred currency, please read a related question posted as a comment. (But for now, I believe US dollar is the best currency to bring in case you have to have an intermediate one.)</li>
<li>No, exchange rate doesn't depend on the visual state of the banknote. Bring new and crisp banknotes as you risk your money not being accepted at most of the places. Also, don't accept any torn or otherwise damaged rupee notes because you'll have hard time getting rid of them.</li>

Is there an authoritative source I can check, or is it better to drug-up anyway (or not to)?</p>
","<p>Malaria is transmitted by a specific type of mosquito (female <em>anopheles</em>) that breeds in still / stagnant water that collects after monsoons. If you're travelling during winter or summer in India, you don't have to worry about this too much as the weather conditions are not conducive for these specific mosquitoes to breed. Locals usually don't take malaria pills, instead preferring to sleep in mosquito nets that will prevent you from getting bitten regardless of what type of mosquito it is. Most mosquitoes you'll get bitten by (and you will) are harmless.</p>

<p>While most travellers going to take precautions against malaria, another mosquito vector-borne disease that is common in India is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_fever"">dengue</a>. Compared to malaria, dengue is a bigger threat as it's harder to 'prevent'; there are no pills or vaccinations for it. Like malaria, this is also transmitted by a specific kind of mosquito (<em>aedes aegypti</em>) locally known as 'tiger mosquito' as it has yellow-striped bands on its legs. If you see such a mosquito, then you know to be extra careful.</p>

<p>City and town authorities take disease control seriously and frequent fumigation is carried out during monsoon season; you will be fairly safe when if you're stick mostly to cities when travelling. It helps to keep an eye on local newspapers if you're travelling for longer periods for news about dengue outbreaks. Take extra precaution when you're staying near places with stagnant pools of water, such as the nature reserves, backwater lagoons et al.</p>

<p>Long story short: Sleep in a mosquito net, or burn a '<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito_coil"">mosquito coil</a>' (ask for it at any convenience store; it burns slowly and releases smoke fumes that keep mosquitoes away. Handier to carry around than a net, but fragile so no point buying in bulk as they will break when packed in bags). It will keep you safe from malaria/dengue-carrying mosquitoes and every other kind.</p>

I don't know if one part didn't print properly (I did get about a dozen bits of card in one go, between tickets and seat reservations), or if I lost it (eg it fell out when I was getting a different ticket from my ticket holder), but the upshot is that I don't have both parts.</p>

<p>Is it possible to get the missing part (re)printed at all? Perhaps from a station ticket office, by showing them the part I have and the booking reference? Or by speaking with the website I bought it from?</p>

<p>(Normally I gather they won't reprint flexible tickets, presumably due to worries that you could otherwise give the duplicate to someone else to use, but as this ticket is a mandatory two-part ticket, someone with the missing other half couldn't use it)</p>
","<p>The answer unfortunately is <strong>NO</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The National Rail Conditions of Carriage states that lost or mislaid tickets will not be replaced nor will refunds be made in respect of them. You will need to book new tickets if unable to find the old ones.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are in a position with only half the ticket (seat reservation and no ticket) then you will have to buy a new ticket. From experience the quicker you do this the cheaper it will be as in the UK tickets generally get more expensive for long distance travel the closer to the travel time.</p>

<p>Train companies justify this rule by suggesting that you could have given the ticket away or sold it. Train companies do not accept responsibility for lost or mislaid tickets.</p>

<p>However, if you have misplaced or lost your seat reservation, and are on a flexible (Anytime or Off-Peak, but not Advanced), I have got away with this by sitting in a non reserved seat on the train. No questions asked by the train conductor.</p>

""Sightseeing"" and ""shopping"" would likely not qualify as good reasons, although eg. ""going to the airport"" certainly would.</p>

<p>That's the legal theory.  In practice, I really don't see Japanese police stopping a parent out with their children at night, unless they're in Kabukicho about to enter a pink salon or something &mdash; and the rest of the ordinance goes on to outline a whole bunch of places youth at night are <em>never</em> allowed, including movie theaters and virtually all forms of nightlife.  Shops and city streets, though, are not on the list, and if you <em>were</em> stopped on the street, the statement ""we're going home/to our hotel"" would in all likelihood be more than sufficient.</p>

"Is it culturally acceptable for an American to visit the memorials in Hiroshima and Nagasaki?","10111","","<p>The title says it all.  Is it culturally acceptable (to the Japanese) for an American to visit the memorials to the victims of the atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki?  I realize that a Japanese person probably wouldn't tell me to leave, but would they think I was being rude or uncouth?</p>
","<p>Here's an excerpt from <a href=""http://wikitravel.org/en/Hiroshima"">Wikitravel</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although many visitors, especially Americans, may feel apprehensive about visiting Hiroshima, it is a friendly, welcoming city, with as much interest in Western culture as anywhere else in Japan. Tourists are welcomed, and exhibits related to the atomic bomb are not concerned with blame or accusations. Bear in mind, though, that many <em>hibakusha</em> [the survivors] still live in the city, and even most of the young people in Hiroshima have family members who lived through the blast. As such, the average Hiroshima resident isn't likely to relish talking about it, although you needn't shy away from the topic if one of the chatty fellows around the Peace Park brings it up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite this and @MeNoTalk's comment, another <a href=""http://www.culturosity.com/articles/Hiroshima.htm"">interesting story by Kate Berardo on Culturosity.com</a> demonstrates that you can't be certain that no one will care or direct resentment toward you, but the circumstances of the story suggest it may have been a little bit of bad timing and luck on the author's part. Besides, it was really just a few angry words with a sidelong glance; nothing an American traveling abroad shouldn't be prepared for almost regardless of where one chooses to go.</p>

<p>Regardless of what some others might think, my opinion as an American FWIW: if you want to go to learn about the consequences of the bombings, go with an open mind and sympathetic attitude – I will if I'm ever lucky enough to get the chance. There is <a href=""http://www.pcf.city.hiroshima.jp/index_e2.html"">a museum in Hiroshima dedicated to memorializing the victims and promoting peace</a>. <a href=""http://www.pcf.city.hiroshima.jp/hpcf/heiwabunka/pce65/english/65_09E.html"">One of their English newsletters</a> describes a visit from American students positively, demonstrating a welcoming reception by the museum staff and local students. If you want to visit Hiroshima to appreciate the rest of the city as well, more power to you. It certainly has much more to offer than war history. I'm sure the same is true of Nagasaki.</p>

<p>I would only advise against going with an attitude like <a href=""http://pmands.com/on-the-67th-anniversary-of-hiroshima-americans-have-nothing-to-apologize-for/"">this guy's</a>; I suspect few will be particularly eager to hear contentious opinions about the bombings from an American perspective (especially not an ignorant one). Make your mission one of learning and receptivity to the local culture and perspectives, not one of ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truthiness"">truthiness</a>"" or ""<a href=""http://www.cc.com/video-clips/67hgjb/chappelle-s-show-when-keeping-it-real-goes-wrong---brenda-johnson---uncensored"">keeping it real</a>"", and you should be fine.

"Can I take my disassembled desktop computer on a flight from Turkey to the UK?

If the devices are in your hand baggage, they must be fully charged and you have to demonstrate, that they are working, or something like that.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
","<p>The whole idea behind making sure that electronic devices work is to make sure that the internal parts are not replaced with a bomb, if someone tries to smuggle a bomb inside an electronic device, it will not be possible to achieve that while keeping the original components intact, so the best is just to make sure the device is working and this will exclude any possibility of hiding bomb parts inside electronic devices (laptops, tablets, etc.). It is simple yet effective method.</p>

<p>Given that, computer parts are not the main concern here, the main concern is what underneath the holding case (laptop case, desktop case, etc.), so in theory parts will not be a problem as long as you EXPLAIN to the security personnel what are they. I am also positive there are not restriction of any kind to computer parts onboard. </p>

<p>Anyway, Here are few tips:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do not wrap them in a way that makes it hard to show what's inside the wrap.</li>
<li>If you have the boxes, put them in their boxes. This will make the job much easier.</li>
<li>If boxes not available, bring the manuals, usually manuals contains photos of the device and explanation, this will save you from <em>EXPLAINING</em>.</li>
<li><em>EXPLAIN</em> to them if they ask, they have nothing personal against you, they are just doing their job to keep everyone safe</li>
<li>Give a hint to the security personnel before putting the bag in the X-Ray scanner, this way they won't set off any alarm when they spot the bomb-like things in the screen.</li>
<li>Come 30 minutes earlier, just in case you need to explain.</li>

"Why is international first class much more expensive than international economy class?","10063","","<p>I fly domestic first class a lot and it is rarely more than double the cost of an economy ticket. For example, for Thanksgiving my first class ticket is costing about $1200 where the economy tickets cost about $800.</p>

<p>I am looking to book an international flight, however, and the cost for first class is WAY WAY higher than economy, almost prohibitively so (see graphic below). <strong>Why is the proportional cost for international first class so much higher?</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jZVXY.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jZVXY.png"" alt=""first class ticket cost""></a></p>
","<p>Your question is (I think): why does (US) domestic first class exceed the cost of economy by 50%, whereas international first class is many times the cost of economy.</p>

<p>The answer to that is that the comparative services are vastly different. In (US) domestic first class you get a little more legroom, and a seat roughly 50% more wide. In international first class, you will often get far more than a fully reclining seat - a private bed is not unknown.</p>

<p>Comparing the plane's floor-plate take is a crude measure, but it would not surprise me if a first class seat took 10 times the amount of space as an economy seat on an international flight. Look at the floor plans <a href=""https://talkairlines.wordpress.com/2014/09/30/talkinterior-air-china-boeing-747-8i-interior-information/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> (image not copied for copyright reasons) and you can see the six seats in the back half of the first class cabin of a 747 take about the same space as 4 rows (40 seats) of economy. Calculating very crudely, that would explain an approximately 7 times difference in price.</p>

<p>Now look at a US domestic layout (<a href=""https://www.united.com/web/en-US/content/travel/inflight/aircraft/airbus319/default.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> for example). You can see the 8 first class seats take only slightly more space than 12 economy seats. That would crudely explain a 50% difference in price.</p>

<p>In terms of flying experience, there is a world of difference. LAX to NYC in first class is, well, slightly less uncomfortable than economy. However, NYC to LHR (roughly the same time) is luxurious in comparison.</p>

<p>Personal opinion: if economy class between domestic and international are roughly the same, domestic first is significantly worse than international business (somewhere between international premium economy and international business), and international first is way out in front in terms of travelling experience (if you have money to spend / burn). On one of the two occasions I've flown transatlantic BA first class (sadly over ten years ago), I was given as an unprompted gift a 200 GBP (then about $350) bottle of claret, simply because I'd had a few glasses on board and seemed to quite like it, and they weren't particularly busy; I am told the experience is now far better.</p>

<p>It's been pointed out that some carriers (e.g. AA) now offer certain domestic routes (LAX/SFO &lt;-> JFK/EWR) with full reclining beds in first; however (as if to prove the point) these first class routes come at more of a premium than normal domestic first.</p>

"Crossing from Georgia into Turkey","10056","","<p>Going from Georgia into Turkey overland—can you do that without problems? (Assume no visa requirement for either country.) What border crossing points are there?</p>

<p>Also, what are the public transport options like: Are there any direct connections e.g. from Tbilisi or Batumi crossing over into Turkey? Or if you cross on foot, are there good connections for continuing from the border in the direction of Ankara and Istanbul?</p>
","<p>No problems at all. The two countries are friends especially due to the pipeline bringing oil from Azerbaijan to Turkey via Georgia. Nationals of either country can visit the other without visas.</p>

<h2>Border crossings</h2>

<p>There are two active border crossings and I believe one inactive one.</p>

<p>The main one is on the Black Sea coast and is very busy and has been modernized on both sides of the border. The Turkish side is <strong><em>Sarp</em></strong> (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopa"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hopa</a> district) and the Georgian side is <strong><em>სარფი (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarpi,_Georgia"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sarpi</a>)</em></strong>. Many trucks cross at this border between Europe and Georgia and beyond to Armenia, Azerbaijan, Iran, and even some Arab countries (well at least before the Arab Spring). The highway passes through here from Samsun to Trabzon on the Turkish side to Batumi on the Georgian side.</p>

<p>There is also a very small rural one. The Turkish side is <strong><em><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%BCrkg%C3%B6z%C3%BC"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Türkgözü</a></em></strong> (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posof"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Posof</a> district) and the Georgian side is <strong><em>ვალე (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vale,_Georgia"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Vale</a>)</em></strong>. The highway here connects Kars on the Turkish side to Akhaltsikhe on the Georgian side. This border crossing is very quiet on both sides. <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/a/8316/583"">Scheuer's answer has opening hour details</a>.</p>

<p>At least for tourists and I'm pretty sure for truck drivers too there is no corruption on either side. You can cross at both points on foot with no problem. The Georgian customs and immigration workers at Sarpi are among the friendliest I've ever dealt with. It usually takes a while to cross here because many busfuls of passengers cross and due to Armenia's borders with both Turkey and Azerbaijan being closed, everybody has to pass through here.</p>

<p>The rural crossing is quite quick to cross. The road has very little traffic which will affect you if you're hitchhiking like I was. There are very few facilities in the villages on either side but the police in Vale on the Georgian side are extremely friendly and helpful. There are many stray dogs around the rural border which worried me because I was on foot and there was nobody to give me a ride, and there were no businesses or houses close to either side in case I were to need help. But even the big ones turned out to be very docile so no problem.</p>

<h2>Transportation</h2>

<p>There are international bus routes passing through the Black Sea crossing connecting at least Batumi and Tbilisi to Trabzon, Samsun, Ankara, and Istanbul. There are even buses connecting Tbilisi to Thessaloniki and Athens in Greece! There are no scheduled buses crossing at the rural crossing. There are no rail crossings between the two countries but Georgia does have rail crossings with all of its other neighbours. (The one to Russia is not operating as of May 2012 however).</p>

<p>Turkish international buses were quite nice and quite cheap. Individual TVs on the back of each seat on at least <strong><em>Luks Karadeniz</em></strong>. I took Samsun to Tbilisi and was told it would take 10 hours but instead it took 15 hours: 10 from Samsun to the border and 5 from the border to Tbilisi (roughly).</p>

<p>If you cross on foot most people take a very cheap taxi from the border to Batumi. I don't know details for the Turkish side. Both countries are famous for their hospitality though. As for the rural crossing, it's a fun challenge to cross on foot as there are no connections and few trucks and cars. Nevertheless if you don't mind waiting in quite beautiful settings it is very easy to hitchhike on both sides though getting to Kars might take a while if you're not young and blonde (-:</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>Apparently the border crossing at <strong>Kartsakhi</strong> (Georgia) / <strong>Çıldır</strong> (Turkey) was just opened in October 2015:</p>

My family are coming to Europe next month and we are discussing all the tiny details as they haven't traveled outside their home country for a long time.</p>

<p>One of the issues that I advised them with is not to carry coins. 10 years ago I was stopped by a dog AFTER I have passed/cleared by the security queue. I was very late and the aircrew was calling for my name but the officer who guided the dog was very bright that she guessed I had lots of coins and she was right. I showed her the coins and ran to the gate.</p>

<p>Is there anything that my family should do to reduce the chances of getting sniffed by the dogs? </p>
","<p>I have met the ""fruit sniffing"" dog several times and am aware (from watching Border Security) of currency-sniffing and firearms-sniffing dogs in addition to the classic drug-sniffers. Generally, these dogs sniff people's bags more than people. (The Canadian beagle that met my flight from the Caribbean once sat [the dog's signal] about my bag, but the handler didn't even want to look in the pocket when I said there was no fruit in it. The Australian german shepherd didn't sit and the handler was not interested in looking to confirm when I said there was peppermint gum in the pocket the dog smelled at the most.)</p>

<p>[As an aside, in addition to being more interested in bags than people, the vast majority of these dogs work <strong>Arrivals</strong> not <strong>Departures</strong> and are found in the baggage hall. The chances of someone being sniffed on their way <strong>to</strong> a plane are very low. Still, since you worry about this, let me also add that they should allow plenty of time to get to the plane so that unexpected stop-and-search moments don't result in them being paged to get to the gate and almost missing the plane. I found <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eW7hqY0SQNQ"">a 6 minute video</a> that specifically shows cash dogs working in Departures at Heathrow. Watch it and you will hear the handlers tell people ""let the dog sniff your bags"" (not you) and see that the dogs do not touch the people. You can also see people putting backpacks and other worn-high bags such as purses down towards the ground to let them be sniffed.]</p>

<p>My recommendation to you (and it helps other things as well) is to have your pockets as empty as possible. In my case that means completely empty. Everything, even my boarding pass, money, and cellphone, is in my carry on bag. Make sure that none of your bags [carryon or checked] contain fruit, meat, drugs, thousands of dollars in bank notes, guns, or illicit drugs of course. </p>

<p>Also, have a quick chat with your imam to clarify the difference between going over to someone's home and patting their dog and generally deliberately interacting with a dog vs being in a public place where a working dog approaches you, sniffs you without touching you, and then leaves. The public is not supposed to pat or interact with the sniffer dogs and the dog is not supposed to touch you at all. This conversation may reduce your anxiety about airport dogs a little, which is a good thing, because anxiety in an airport always gets you extra attention. Your imam may also advise you about the washing that is required after a dog has licked (unlikely with a trained professional) or nuzzled you or your possessions. If you need to bring something specific to clean up from the dog contact, have it with you in your carryon, in a size and format that won't cause issues going through security.</p>

<p>Finally if the dog approaches you, put your bag down, stand up, step back from your bag, and hold your arms out a bit - partly to make yourself bigger and partly so your hands are up and away from the dog. Look at the handler, not the dog, and say ""please don't let the dog touch me"" - the handler should understand that request and be fine with it.</p>

"Why are there so many nonstop flights from London to Geneva?","10011","","<p>I'll go skiing next March and wanted to have a brief look at the flights already, just to see what times are available. So I queried <a href=""https://www.google.co.uk/flights/#search;f=LHR,LGW,STN,LCY,LTN,SEN,QQS;t=GVA,ZHT;d=2018-03-03;r=2018-03-10;s=0"" rel=""noreferrer"">Google Flights</a> and it showed me 51(!) direct flights that day (3rd March 2018)! And they're not code-shares being listed multiple times. I know we're quite lucky here in London as there are frequent direct flights to so many destinations, but that strikes me as a bit much. Assuming I did the maths and counting right, even if they were flying 24 hours a day that'd be one flight every 28 minutes.</p>

<p>So what makes Geneva-London such a special connection that there's the need for so many flights?</p>
","<p>Geneva airport punches a little above its weight (population) because the city hosts many international organisations (it's the UN most important location after New York and was the League of Nations seat before that) and some banking and other services for the rich and famous. Many powerful wealthy people from Europe, the Middle East and Africa have villas on the lake shore or in Divonne-les-Bains (that's in France), shop in the rue du Rhône and get treated at Geneva hospital (it can see half a dozen heads of state or government a year and allows you to arrange anything from a private room to a private wing during your treatment).</p>

<p>This accounts for the good service by the main Middle Eastern carriers and also for flights to some obscure destinations (although most have disappeared in recent years). But I don't think this is the main reason for low-cost short-haul flights to European destinations. In the last decade, the number of those has increased a lot, with a low-cost pier (longer walks and no jet bridge) catering specifically to them, presumably with lower fees than other gates or large hubs like Zurich.</p>

<p>For flights from random cities in the UK, the main factor is probably that Geneva is just a convenient location to fly to to skiing resorts in the French, Swiss or even Italian Alps. In season, there is a long row of shuttle bus operators to all the main resorts in the Northern French Alps waiting just outside the main exit. Another detail supporting this theory is that many flights from London (but also from other places in the UK and some in the Netherlands or Scandinavia) are seasonal and/or limited to the week-end. In fact, according to Wikipedia, there is an entire terminal which is only used during the winter charter season. </p>

<p>Finally, “EasyJet” is actually several distinct companies. The largest one by far is the British company, which created the brand. But there are smaller airlines using the same brand, including EasyJet Switzerland. It's actually the remnant of an earlier venture, which was partly bought and rebranded as an EasyJet franchise. It is based out of Geneva Cointroin airport, making it EasyJet's second hub after London-Luton and accounting for 40% of the airport's traffic according to Wikipedia.</p>

"Can you freeze liquids to pass security checks?","10004","","<p>Once I read a suggestion saying that frozen ""liquids"" are not subject to the 100 ml restriction of security checks in airports. I've found <a href=""http://blog.tsa.gov/2009/11/response-to-tsa-takes-big-gulp-over.html"">other</a> <a href=""http://boardingarea.com/flyingwithfish/2011/12/27/freeze-your-drink-fly-through-airport-security-with-it/"">references</a> of this googling, but they all refer to TSA (I assume only hold in the US).</p>

<p>Is it true then that it's possible to carry frozen fluids in your hand luggage, in larger quantities than 100 ml?</p>
","<h2>TSA Allows Frozen Liquids Only if they Are Frozen Solid</h2>

<p>TSA allows frozen liquids if and only if they are presented frozen solid to security checks. This is in my opinion a fairly sneaky way to say ""good luck with that"", seeing as <a href=""https://van.physics.illinois.edu/qa/listing.php?id=1723"">freezing water at room temperature requires a fair amount of pressure to be applied on it</a>. You can always try to find a liquid that presents itself in solid state at room temperature, and try to bring that through security.</p>

<p>Searching for <code>ice</code> on the <a href=""http://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/prohibited-items"">TSA prohibited item search tool</a> yields the following result:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h1>Search Results For: <strong>ice</strong></h1>
  
  <h2>! Special Instructions</h2>
  
  <h3>Frozen liquid items are allowed through the checkpoint as long as they are frozen solid when presented for screening. If frozen liquid items are partially melted, slushy, or have any liquid at the bottom of the container, they must meet 3-1-1 liquids requirements.</h3>
  
  <p>If the frozen item is packed with ice or ice packs in a cooler or other container, the ice or ice packs must be completely frozen when brought through screening. If the ice or ice packs are partially melted and have any liquid at the bottom of the container, they will not be permitted.</p>
  
  <p>Medically necessary liquids may be accompanied by ice packs, but we ask that you declare these items to a security officer for inspection.</p>
  
  <p>You can pack frozen perishables in your carry-on or checked baggage in dry ice. The FAA limits you to five pounds of dry ice that is properly packaged (the package is vented).</p>
  
  <p>The 3-1-1 rule for liquids, aerosols and gels in carry-ons is as follows: containers must be 3.4 ounces or less; stored in a 1 quart/liter zip-top bag; 1 zip-top bag per person. Larger amounts of non-medicinal liquids, gels, and aerosols must be placed in checked baggage.</p>
  
  <p>If the liquid is considered a hazardous material that is permitted onboard an aircraft, it is still subject to the 3-1-1 limitations. Many questions arise on whether an item is hazardous material and what requirements must be met to take it on an aircraft. The Pipeline Hazardous Material Safety Administration (PHMSA) at 1-800-467-4922 or the aircraft operator on which you are flying can assist you with your questions concerning hazardous material.</p>
  
  <p>Even if an item is generally permitted, it may be subject to additional screening or not allowed through the checkpoint if it triggers an alarm during the screening process, appears to have been tampered with, or poses other security concerns. The final decision rests with TSA on whether to allow any items on the plane.</p>

<h2>Australia Does Not Allow Frozen Liquids</h2>

<p><a href=""http://travelsecure.infrastructure.gov.au/international/lags/substances.aspx"">According to Australian regulations</a>, for a liquid, aerosol or gel (LAG) to be considered a solid, it must present itself in this state at room temperature. Therefore, frozen liquids, i.e. liquids that are indeed liquid at room temperature, are still subject to the 100ml rule.</p>

<p>Quoting from the linked site (empasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li><p>All liquids, aerosols and gels (LAGs) are covered by the quantity restrictions. LAGs is defined as:</p>
  
  <ul>

  <li>an aerosol;</li>
  <li>a gel;</li>
  <li>a cream; or</li>

  </ul></li>
  <li><p>If you are unsure whether an item falls within the restrictions, pack it in your checked baggage.</p></li>
  </ul>

<h2>New Zealand Does Not Allow Frozen Liquids</h2>

<p>Similarly as to Australian regulations, <a href=""http://www.avsec.govt.nz/travellers/2/lags-faqs/"">New Zealand regulations</a> say that if the substance presents itself in liquid, gel or aerosol for at room temperature, then it is subject to the 100ml rule.</p>

<h2>Canadian CATSA/ACSTA Does Not Allow Frozen Liquid Food Items</h2>

<p><a href=""http://www.catsa.gc.ca/liquids-food-personal-items"">The Canadian CATSA/ACSTA website</a> mentions solely frozen food items, stating that solid food is food that is normally solid at room temperature. Anything else is subject to the 100ml rule, even if frozen.</p>

<p>Quoting from the linked website (emphasis partially mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>Liquids/Food</h2>
  
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Beverages</strong>: Drink or discard any beverages in containers of more than 100 ml before you get to security screening checkpoint.  This includes water in your personal water bottle. You can refill your container once you pass through security.</li>
  <li><strong>Duty-Free Alcohol</strong>: Be sure you know the rules for bringing duty-free alcohol as part of your carry-on baggage.</li>
  <li><p>Food is not exempted from restrictions on liquids, foods and personal items:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Non-solid food</strong> (e.g. yogurt, pudding, peanut butter, jam) in your carry-on must be in containers of 100 ml or less.

"Uk visa got refused due to unexplained deposits. How to re-apply?","10001","","<p>My husband, my 4-year-old son and I as a family applied for a Family Visit visa last month to visit my husband's sister in UK. For documents we submitted everything that was required (employee certificate of my husband, bank statement, pay slips invitation letter from the family in UK, and tickets booking). The reason for refusal was a large deposit highlighted by them in the statement, which was indemnity or service money of deceased father of my husband. We got this from his company because my husband is the only son of his, and legal guardian of his mother and two sisters.  </p>

<p>They rejected because of lack of evidence of this amount which we didn't provide them also they think that we will not leave UK and are trying to get entry in the UK. Although we have every evidence regarding money deposit and we are leaving behind our dependants in Saudi Arabia who are my husband's mother and sister, so we have their valid residents permit too. We are deciding to re apply for the visa with this evidence and support documents. </p>

<p>How far it's going to be approved?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>⦁ THE DECISION</p>
  
  <p>⦁ I Have refused your application for visit visa because i am not
  satisfied that you meet the requirements of paragraph V 4.2 of
  appendix V: Immigration rules for visitor because:</p>
  
  <p>⦁ You proposed to travel to the UK for 45 days to visit your sister
  and her family. You have provided UK sponsor letter confirming your
  visit. In view of proposed close family visa i have therefore
  considered your application very carefully taking into full
  consideration the compassionate circumstances surrounding your
  application. I am however required to also assess your own personal,
  domestic and economic circumstances in determining whether you are a
  general visitor travelling to UK solely for the period and purpose you
  state.</p>
  
  <p>⦁ I have noticed that you never previously travelled to UK or any
  other country with similiar immigration requirements,and you therefore
  do not have history of travel and compliance to consider.</p>
  
  <p>⦁ As evidence of available funds, you have provided bank statements
  from NCB and riyad bank dated 18/11/2014 to 17/05/2015. You claim you
  are employed by ABC company and earning an average monthly salary of 
  2777 pounds. However I note that over this period there are salary
  payments are seen in the bank statement submitted. Furthermore there
  are large transfer and cash deposits which are six times your claimed
  salary. you have not provided evidence towards the origin of these
  recent deposits and in the absence of reasonable evidence. I am not
  satisfied that these bank statements accurately reflect your personal
  circumstances.</p>
  
  <p>⦁ I have there been unable to assess your economic circumstances in
  KSA and as such i am not satisfied your income and circumstances are
  as you claim and therefore i am not satisfied that you are travelling
  to the uk for the period and purpose you state on this occasion.</p>
  
  <p>⦁ I have therefore refused your application because i am not
  satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that you meet all the
  requirements of the relevant paragraph V4.2 (a) (c) of the United
  Kingdom Immigration Rules.</p>
  
  <p>⦁ Your right of appeal is limited to the grounds referred to in
  section 84(1)(c) of the nationality, Immigration and Asylum act 2002.</p>
</blockquote>
","<p>The refusal notice is wonky... The title identifies it as a business visit visa  refusal, which is erroneous and unrelated to the application.  The content refers to a 'family visa'.  There's no such thing as a 'family visa' for visitors or even 'family visit visa'.  The ECO refused on paragraph V4.2 (a) (c), but the reasons he wrote indicate he should have refused under V4.2 (e) instead.  And the reference to ""section 84(1)(c) of the nationality, Immigration and Asylum act 2002"" is total whack from the blue. It's old legislation that has been superseded.  Normally they are supposed to give at least two reasons, and in your case they gave only one.  There could be a missing paragraph that got left out somehow.  The sentences starting with ""however"" and ""furthermore"" don't make sense. (However to what?) They do not put junior ECO's in Saudi Arabia, so these errors might have been transcription errors by an assistant, or a mix-up in speed codes, or the word processor got confused, or something else.  All in all, it's a poor quality refusal notice.</p>

<p>Those errors will not get them to reverse their decision.  But it would be advisable to request a different ECO for your next application.  They will do this without prejudice if you ask them to; plus an ECM will review the decision if it is adverse to you (normally refusals are randomly sampled).</p>

<p>In comments, you wrote that the salary deposits were in order.  So the remaining issue is the provenance of the large deposits.  Irregular deposits need to be explained carefully and extra evidence should be submitted to back up your explanation.  If the deposits came from your father-in-law's death there would be documentation or correspondence from the estate executor or some other law firm  that shows the amounts.  You need to find that documentation and include it in your next application (translated to English with an apostille since they will be legal documents).  </p>

<p>They usually do not like it when there is a provenance of funds problem because it looks like a 'funds parking' strategy where you are trying to make your financial capacity better than it is.  They treat it as mildly deceptive, so you will need to include an explanation of why you did not include the appropriate evidence in your first application.</p>

<p>You wrote in your question that you included hotel bookings as evidence. This reduced the quality of your application because it shows you did not study the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/423699/2015_04_20_Visitor_Supporting_Documents_Guide_-_Final__2__-_CLEAN.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">guidance</a>.  Be sure that your next application is informed by their guidance.</p>

<p>Despite the text in the refusal notice about appeals, there is no path of appeal available to you (they got that part flat-out <a href=""http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0002.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">wrong</a>).</p>

<p>Once you have the necessary evidence, it's fine to apply again.  </p>

"Do flight attendants prefer I press the button or walk to the back? (Long-haul flights)","10000","","<p>I fly Abu Dhabi - Amsterdam - Portland, OR and back frequently.  Each leg is about 8 to 10 hours.  For most people, it is their one 'long flight,' and are sleeping, but for me, because I have two of them, it is a much longer day.</p>

<p>The shades are drawn and everyone's asleep, but I'd like to have a couple beers and watch a movie with my headphones.  <strong>Would cabin crew prefer I walk quietly to the back and ask them for a beer (this is what I usually do), or to press the call button.</strong>  I want to be as polite as possible.  I understand this might be subjective, but I'm hoping there's a universal rule-of-thumb.</p>
","<p>There is no specific preference, it depends on the person actually. Some do not like to be interrupted while they are at their position (usually the galleys) because it is sometimes the only place where there are no people and they can loosen up a little. Here are some general tips:</p>

<p><strong>Good times to use the call button:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>During a service, do not even think to go to their position. Just press the call button and wait.</li>
<li>Make the first request via the call button, regardless of the time. </li>
<li>Avoid going yourself ~30 minutes before the second service, usually it's the time when the crew start preparing the second service, and the second rest shift is not awake yet (if the crew has rest, which is usually the case in 8+ hours flights). They will be busy, it's better not to request at all in this time as the service will start shortly anyway.</li>
<li>If passengers are not sleeping, expect others to use the call button and the crew would be busy preparing their requests, so get in line and press the call button, do not go yourself.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Good times to go yourself to the galley</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Afterwards, if most people are sleeping, it's ok to go yourself, since they will not be busy preparing requests for the other many passengers who pressed the button. </li>
<li>It is very common in long flights around the middle of the flight for passengers to want to stretch their legs, so that's a good time and most crewmembers are expecting that. I have seen galleys turn into canteens at these times. </li>
</ul>

<p>Ordering the first time via the call button then going yourself the second time is the best you can do in general, they will understand that you do not want to bother them. In case you go yourself and they request you to sit back and they will deliver it, do so. In long flights the crew usually have rest shifts after the first service until shortly before the second service. During this time the crew will be operating with half the number, but that shouldn't affect anything since most passengers are usually sleeping at this time as well. The only bad time is before the second service, when people starts to wake up and the half the crew is either still sleeping or just woke up, either way they will be preparing for the second service, so it's better to avoid requests at this time as I mentioned earlier. </p>

<p>There could be things I forgot, but again if a crewmember asked you to sit back and wait, do so and do not go back yourself again, it's a clear sign that he/she wants to you use the button, be his guest! sometimes this is simply due to airline policy, especially if the number of passengers standing at the back is becoming big, in the name of security. </p>

"How do you prepare for long haul flights?","9996","","<p>I'm always feeling a bit unwell during and after long haul flights. I lose my appetite, can't sleep in the plane, food has no taste no matter what. However, I'm pretty sure it's not the flying itself, since I did fly small planes for about 2 years and had fun doing that. I'm also pretty sure it's not the jetlag's fault.</p>

<p>Is there anything I can do to prepare my body for long-haul flights, say Australia-Europe (that's about 2x 12h long flights, and maybe 1-3h stopover in Asia)? </p>
","<p>And we introduce Mark's patent-pending method to surviving the hell that is NZ to London superhaul economy class travel:</p>

<ol>
<li>Prepare your entertainment. Sure, you will likely have movies on the plane.  But I've done several 10-13 hour trips with broken screens or no entertainment system - SINCE 2010.  Don't bet on having it.  Charge laptop batteries, iPads, iPods, Kindles, get a new book from the library or whatever keeps you happy.</li>
<li>Clothing. It can get cold on a flight.  Surprisingly cold.  I layer it up - my trick is to always wear my jacket over my top going through security - it means I can just put wallet etc in my zip-up pockets, and simply remove my jacket in security, meaning no having to constantly remove stuff for the xray, especially in the multiple stopovers.  Once onboard, I remove it and keep it under the chair in front of me (I'm not that tall) or put it in the overhead compartment.</li>
<li>BOOK your seat beforehand, if at all possible.  It's getting harder these days to secure the emergency exit row, but if possible, GET IT.  Even if you can't, when you get to the airport, ask as nicely and politely as you can to every new staff member you see - at the checkin counter, at the gate, and finally on the plane.  All three have worked for me at different times.  As a failsafe, book it online beforehand if at all possible, and use <a href=""http://www.seatguru.com/"">SeatGuru</a> to decide the best seat for your flight.  I prefer at the back, it's slightly bumpier, but away from screaming kids - they tend to locate them close to the bulkhead.  Finally, in your decision, realise that if you're flying over the ocean - there is NOTHING to see - so why have a window seat? Get an aisle, it means you can get up an walk around any time you want.  Just not the very back row - sometimes the seats don't recline all the way, and you get a queue next to you waiting for the bathroom.</li>
<li>Personally, I can't sleep on planes. I've accepted this, and plan accordingly. I dislike sleeping tablets and the side effects, so I sleep well the night before (or try to) and then just accept I'll be stuffed after the flight.  However, from all the experience I've had from others telling me, the eyemasks do wonders, those neck pillows that make you look like such the beginner traveller actually apparently are quite nice, and again, the seat makes a difference - it's much harder in the middle of three seats to get any sleep.  Aisle also means you can put your feet out a bit further, but beware of tramplers.  Exit row mitigates this problem - more leg room than you'll ever need!</li>
<li>Food and drink - never drink alcohol on a superhaul flight.  Sure, it's nice but you're losing so much body water anyway due to the dry atmosphere that you need all the water you can drink.  Ditch the alcohol and go for juice or water instead, and make use of the drinking fountains next to the bathroom/bulkhead - surprising how few people know about them.  You'll feel better during the flight, and look and feel fresher when you land.</li>
<li>Drugs - sleeping tablets - some friends swear by them, as well as people like my brother claiming that the anti-jetlag pills completely freed him from the effects.  I'm dubious about the latter, not enough evidence for that yet, but the sleeping ones bother me - some chemically replicate the sleep state - ie, mind asleep, and body 'paralysed' during that time, and have heard some terrifying stories about <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis"">Sleep Paralysis</a> - something terrifying enough in the comfort of your own home, and not something I'd want to experience at 36,000ft!</li>
<li>I'm not sure about the food losing its taste - could just be that airline food is pretty rubbish anyway ;) but perhaps it's the lack of hydration as well, so water with the food may help.</li>
</ol>

<p>I don't think anyone ever 'enjoys' a 29 hour flight (well of 3 flights) from one side of the world to the other, but you can at least lessen the pain by enjoying some movies, attempting to sleep, and all else failing, make friends with the person next to you ;)</p>

"Transit visa for Brussels for Indian citizens","9922","","<p>I am travelling from India to NY in coming month.</p>

<p>My flight will halt for about 1 hr at Brussels, for technical checking and passenger on boarding. May I know whether I would require transit Visa-on-arrival at Brussels Airport, if for any unexpected reason passengers are asked to disembark the flight?  </p>

<p>I am an Indian citizen.</p>

<p>US Visa type: F1 (Student)</p>
","<p>As long as you remain in the transit area of the airport, you do not need a visa as an Indian citizen in Belgium (or any other Schengen country except France, Germany, Spain and the Czech Republic), even if you need to disembark and catch a connecting flight. This should also apply to any unexpected need to leave the airplane in your case. If you would require an airport transit visa (ATV), the <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/30569/do-i-need-a-visa-to-transit-in-the-schengen-area"">US visa could help</a> but it does not matter here since you can in any case transit without ATV.</p>

<p>All this only applies if you have only <em>one</em> layover in the Schengen area, in an airport with a proper transit area. If you have two layovers with an intra-Schengen flight in between (like <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/17385/is-a-schengen-visa-transit-visa-required-for-transit-flight-from-vienna-to-frank"">the previous question about Vienna and Frankfurt</a>) or if you need to change airports or otherwise leave the transit area, you need to have the right to enter the Schengen area. In this case, the rules for entry (as opposed to transit) would apply. Consequently, an airport transit visa would not be enough (you need a full Schengen visa) and the exemption for US visa holders would not apply either.</p>

<p>There are also provisions to grant a visa at the border in extraordinary circumstances (say an emergency landing at an airport with no transit facility) but in normal circumstances, it's not possible to get a visa-on-arrival. If you do need a visa for your trip (whether a regular type C visa or an airport transit visa), then it needs to be obtained in advance. Airlines have to check your visa and would refuse boarding if you don't have the documentation needed for your transit.</p>

<p>Is there any train service from Gold Coast to Sydney?  How long and which station to go? Is the train ticket able to be booked online?</p>
","<p>There are no direct trains between the Gold Coast and Sydney. The line between Brisbane and the Gold Coast is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Rail"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Queensland Rail, 3 ft 6 in gauge</a>. Between Brisbane and Sydney is standard gauge, run by <a href=""http://www.nswtrainlink.info/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">New South Wales Trainlink</a> (formerly Countrylink). They're not compatible, so you have to change.</p>

<p>One option is to take the early morning NSW Trainlink bus from somewhere like Surfers Paradise, which connects with a train at Casino (just over the NSW border), and then the train onwards to Sydney. Another option is to take an early morning Queensland Rail train from the Gold Coast up to Brisbane, then catch the Sydney train there.</p>

<p>Alternately, there's an overnight sleeper service. For that, you'd leave the Gold Coast on a bus mid afternoon, get to Casino late afternoon, then take the sleeper to Sydney arriving in the morning.</p>

"Is it possible to make a decent income from travelling the world?","9847","","<p>My dream is to be able to travel the world and have a new adventure every day. With the internet, every day I'm able to see this beautiful and unique world, but those are only photos. I want to experience those places and cultures.</p>

<p>There are some things, of course, I have to think about, and the one most important is <strong>income</strong>. How do I support myself while travelling the world? The first thing I think is <em>What are my talents?</em></p>

<p>I'm a software engineer and love everything about software and the open source world. I'm a hard gamer and love to play a variety of games. I have very little experience with video and photo editing (Photoshop and After Effects), but the little I had with that, I enjoyed it. <strong>How can I make a decent salary writing software while travelling the world?</strong></p>

<p>I've also thought about writing a blog about my day-to-day adventures, and maybe even making a Youtube channel with vlogs about my day-to-day adventures. If I were to do that, how successful do you think it would be? If it was, how well could that support me (or how much money do you think I can make)? I also thought about photography, and to take photos and to sell them online, if that's possible.</p>

<p>Of course, there are things that, as a normal citizen, I wouldn't have to pay like house payment (though I would be paying rent or for a hotel which may or may not be less), car payment (though I would rent cars when I needed to), home internet (I could use Wi-Fi at local shops if applicable), entertainment (most likely if I'm travelling the world, I will have less concern about what new movies or games are coming out), etc.</p>

<p>I make a pretty good salary and have GREAT benefits including health care, retirement, etc. For me, it would be hard to let go of those kind of things. Is it possible while travelling the world to get some sort of health care? I hate to sound negative, but what happens if I need surgery but can't afford it, could I not get health care? And how would I take care of my retirement? What happens when I'm old and decrepit and don't move around as well as now?</p>

<p>It's that time in my life where sitting behind a desk, 40 hours a week, 5 days a week just isn't cutting it. Has anybody here or anybody you know of attempted this? How successful were they?</p>
","<p>I do exactly this, and have done so for the past five years. I am a software developer (previously web, now iOS) doing contract work for customers in a range of countries. I live in about five or six countries each year, spending anywhere from a week to several months in each.</p>

<p>I've lived in Tokyo, Bangkok, Singapore, London, Rome, Prague, Sydney, Melbourne, Manila, Chiang Mai, Bali, Kuala Lumpur, and many more.</p>

<p>I'm currently on a full time contract as a senior developer for a company based in a country which I have never been to. </p>

<p>As others have said, there's no shortcuts. It's not often easy to get remote contract work, and the usual freelancing risks are often magnified. It's a risky lifestyle with regards to job security, so you'll need to make some mental changes, and be comfortable with living a bit more on the edge.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Build trust.</strong> Customers aren't going to want to take on an unknown worker in a far away country without first establishing a reasonable level of trust. Build strong business relationships with your clients.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>If you're doing full time contracts, don't move too fast.</strong> Travelling sucks up days at a time, in airports, trains, etc. And settling into a new workspace in a new country can have unexpected complications (dodgy internet, etc) that can cause you to lose precious workdays. Plan on spending a minimum of a week in each place, unless you've set the time aside as holiday time.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure you've booked and planned a decent length stay in each place that will provide you reliable internet, a work environment free of excessive distractions, and enough full work days to get the work done.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Keep your customers happy.</strong> The same goes for any contract work, but when you're living in countries in which you're not a legal resident, there's no safety net to catch you if you stuff up and lose an important client.</p></li>
<li><p>If you're only doing casual, part time work, staying in hostels is okay. But if you've got a big project that needs serious time commitment, hostels are not good. You will be surrounded by people who are on holiday, who will treat you like you are on holiday. <strong>Holidayers are the digital nomad's kryptonite</strong> - they suck up your precious work hours with casual conversation and temptations of day trips to interesting local sights.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Most of the time, book serviced apartments and hotels.</strong> You'll get a distractionless work environment with reliable internet. Hostels and budget hotels are a risk to your employment, and should be reserved for weeks you set aside as mostly holiday time. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>For healthcare et al, you need travel insurance.</strong> You can usually buy travel insurance for up to 12 months, which gives you at least some safety net for the year ahead. Booking 12 months insurance is not much more expensive than booking 3 months, as most of the cost is built into a base rate, regardless of duration. Travel insurance will cover immediate medical costs, as well as theft of possessions, etc. Research it well and make sure the policy covers everything you need, and that you've understood the terms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Don't bother with travel blogging or travel photography if you already have skills that fetch much higher pay</strong> (ie software development). Every backpacker with a camera and a laptop is trying to be a travel blogging photographer, and almost all of them are earning effectively nothing. Use the high paying skills you have, and earn a proper income.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>You don't need to downgrade your lifestyle.</strong> Work hard for the right people doing the job that you know how to do well, and you will earn a full income. There's no need to walk the streets in dirty backpacker clothes looking like an extra from The Beach.</p></li>

<p>However does that mean that it's per day, or it's just $12 in total?</p>

<p>I don't care paying a little (maybe up to $100), but I don't want to end up having to pay $12*30=$360 while I could find another solution.</p>
","<p>It very clearly mentions in the regulations on the document that you cannot keep it at the service for more than 48 hours,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Baggage only held within 48 hours. After 48 hours, it will be treated as unclaimed baggage.</p>

<p>Keeping this in mind, the $12 fee is applicable when you store your luggage for 24-48 hours, after which it will be deemed as unclaimed baggage and they cannot guarantee its safety.</p>

<p>On a side note, some obscure Trip Adviser users do claim that they have used it for longer durations such as 2 to 3 weeks.</p>

How can one make sure your family and country knows about the situation? What if you don't understand the language, or what the charges are?</p>
","<p>The level of support offered by embassies will vary widely from each foreign embassy / consulate to another. A couple of standard support measures provided though are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Contact family members to pass messages along</li>
<li>Provide details on contact information on local lawyers, and interpreters if needed.</li>
<li>Depending on whether such a support system is available for your nationality, get you <a href=""http://www.prisonersabroad.org.uk/About-Us.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">in touch with charities</a> or provide loans for financial aid.</li>
</ul>

<p>Probably more important than what they do provide is what they <em>don't</em> provide. Embassies do not directly provide legal assistance, immunity, or evacuation just because someone is in trouble with the police. If caught in such a situation, it's necessary to <strong>manage expectations on what an embassy can do realistically</strong>.</p>

<p>While it isn't always possible to know the local laws of a country, not knowing you did something wrong is rarely ever a valid excuse. Use common sense - and as a rough yardstick don't do anything illegal in your own country - for starters. This is especially <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/1224/tactics-to-avoid-getting-harassed-by-corrupt-police"">problematic if you're travelling in regions police officials are known to be corrupt</a> as they could use legitimate less-known laws or made-up charges to shake you down. Embassies will rarely, if ever, provide assistance in these situations unless something seriously goes wrong.</p>

<p>Another thing that can help you receive assistance quickly is your country's embassy offers any form of registration programme, so that they know your details. Probably not very useful or even necessary for short-term travellers though.</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>Why would anyone choose the slow ferry when the fast hydrofoil is only $30 to $40 more expensive?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The hydrofoil is noisy and you must remain in your seat. There is a movie but you can't hear it and may not even be able to converse easily with your travelmates. There's not really a view from the windows since they're obscured by spray.</li>
<li>The hydrofoil has no atmosphere. You will not meet anybody.</li>
<li>2nd class ferry accommodation is dormitory style. You will at least meet the other people in your cabin. I generally make at least one new Korean or Japanese friend each crossing. Often they insist on buying me dinner or beer!</li>
<li>Even if you're in a dorm sleeping on a Korean yo on the floor, it's super comfortable. I always sleep like a baby. But you might want to bring earplugs in case somebody in your cabin is snoring.</li>
<li>You can walk around above deck and take photos. The views going through the Kanmon Strait in Japan can be very very nice.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Payment and money</strong></p>

<p>You can pay with credit card for the ticket in either country <strong>but</strong> there will also be some annoying terminal fees which must be paid in cash! I have been caught out twice and had to run around looking for an ATM! I believe all the ferry terminals have a currency exchange with fair rates.</p>

<p>It is very wise to have some currency ready for when you arrive at the other side since credit cards and even ATM cards have some unexpected problems in both countries. I once had to walk from the Hakata port to downtown Fukuoka because I couldn't get bus money!</p>

<p><strong>Naming</strong></p>

<p>You will often see <strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakata-ku,_Fukuoka"" rel=""noreferrer"">Hakata</a></strong>, which is the name of the port of <strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukuoka"" rel=""noreferrer"">Fukuoka</a></strong>. As far as you are concerned they are the same place. <strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimonoseki"" rel=""noreferrer"">Shimonoseki</a></strong> is small and only has one name.</p>

<p><strong>Fukuoka or Shimonoseki?</strong></p>

<p>Fukuoka is about 100km further south than Shimonoseki, so further away from Tokyo if that's where you're coming from / going to.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Fukuoka</strong> is a very green city by Japanese standards. It has many parks and also some very interesting buildings including the ACROS building that looks like a hill with trees growing right up the side and a path you can walk through it, and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal_City_Hakata"" rel=""noreferrer"">Canal City</a> which is a shopping and entertainment centre with a canal running through it.</li>
<li><strong>Shimonoseki</strong> is very small and feels quite poor for a Japanese city. There's not much choice of places to stay or eat. <strong>But</strong> if you are a fan of sushi or Japanese cuisine, it is the number one place for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugu"" rel=""noreferrer"">fugu</a> (pufferfish) in all Japan and is famous for this throughout the country.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fukuoka: ACROS on the left, Canal City on the right:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6f5rD.jpg"" alt=""Fukuoka architecture""></p>

<p><strong>Both ferries</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The travel time is much shorter than the time passengers must spend on the ferry. For some reason passengers must board hours before departure and remain on board for hours after docking!</li>
<li>You might be the only westerner on the ferry. There is no western shower but all ferries have a Japanese style communal bath! (Separate for male and female)</li>
<li>There are lots of vending machines but you can't change money on the boat. Most passengers are Korean and the operators are also Korean I believe. But I seem to recall that some of the boats only accept Japanese Yen in the vending machines. Others may accept only Korean Won. No ferry accepts both types of coins. On some SeongHee ferries you can change currencies over the counter, though the rates are not really reasonable.</li>
<li>There is a restaurant on all ferries with fairly reasonable prices and open for dinner and breakfast.</li>

<p><strong>Trains from Busan to Seoul</strong></p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport_in_South_Korea#Services"" rel=""noreferrer"">Korea has several levels of train service</a> and the slowest ones are much cheaper but still very modern and comfortable and still pretty quick. The ones I noticed going to Seoul last time I was in Busan were KTX, Saemaul, and Mugunghwa. But you might find the other types also when you get there.</p>

<p>The various kinds of trains have different ranges of classes which may includ unassigned seating tickets as the cheapest option. I always take the Mugunghwa as it's cheap even on a backpacker budget, I'm usually not in a hurry, it's comfy enough to fall asleep on, and it's not any slower at 5 hours than the Saemaul.</p>

<p><strong>Trains for the Japanese ferry terminals</strong></p>

<p>Both Shimonoseki and Fukuoka are well connected by train to all of Japan.</p>

<p>There is a short walk between the Shimonoseki terminal and the train station, mostly on an elevated walkway. You might want to take a taxi if you have lots of luggage.</p>

<p>There is a bus connection between the Hakata/Fukuoka ferry terminal and downtown Fukuoka. You will need Japanese cash for this bus! Beware that Fukuoka has <strong>two centres</strong> so make sure you know where you're heading depending on whether you're staying there or going straight to the train station.</p>

It points out that while crime is relatively low, there has of course been several incidents of protests, riots and political upheaval over the past year. Demonstrations have resulted in deaths, and in particular, there have been some awful incidents involving women.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Protests and public disorder are not confined to Cairo and Alexandria.
  Sohag, Suez, Port Said, Fayoum, Minya, Qena, Asyut, and the Sinai
  Peninsula have also witnessed incidents of political violence.</p>

"Is a picnic at the Chateau de Versailles possible?","9785","","<p>I will be visiting the Versailles Chateau on a Tuesday. I was wondering if it would be useful to take a picnic with me since I doubt the fare offered inside the palace walls (if there is any) is not for vegetarians. Plus, <strong>I would like to picnic</strong> there. What frightens me is the mention of <a href=""http://travelbeyondparis.com/palace-of-versailles-part-2-what-to-see-and-do-in-the-gardens-of-versailles/"">long queues at the baggage check</a> (where presumably, I would need to deposit my picnic as I visit the interiors).</p>

<p>Alternatively, Google maps shows a couple of Boulangeries around the palace. Can I exit the palace and then re-enter after purchasing my food? I have a ""passport ticket"" to the palace allowing me to view the fountain show as well.</p>

<p>What the best option to ensure that I sustain myself on a day long trip (~8 hours possibly) to Versailles?</p>
","<p>You have several possibilities for a picnic on a normal day (as <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/a/45835/22888"">Gayot Fow's answer</a> mentions, the white picnic is worth the trip as well).</p>

<p>The first one is where everyone goes, particularly tourists - namely around the Grand Canal. I would not say that you need to ""reserve"" your spot but some places get crowded.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lGJRP.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>A picture I took in May, on a Sunday, from the left bank of the canal, where the <em>Allée des Matelots</em> meets the Grand Canal (showing the ""crowded areas"" above):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6bdit.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>There is another place, where locals tend to picnic (more than tourists); This is also a typical place for children birthdays, starting from May</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0aPD0.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I would not recommend any of the boulangeries - they are great for bread but will be horribly overpriced for a picnic. Better bring in stuff yourself, there are supermarkets nearby (the closest will probably be <a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/LL5be"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Leader Price</a> or <a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/QqF7H"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Super U</a> which is not that far either). There are others too but I know that side of the gardens better :)</p>

<p>You can now drive into the Versailles Gardens ($$), which can be practical if you need to carry a picnic for 27 people.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> as promised</p>

<p>You have a few places where you need to pay in the Versailles castle:</p>

<ul>
<li>the castle itself (with long waiting lines)</li>
<li>the gardens right in front of the castle (on the other side). You can access them either from the side of the castle, or from the other side (there are two ticket booths on the path from the Grand Canal to the gardens). BTW access if free during winter times.</li>
<li>the <em>Hameau de la Reine</em>, a little village built for Marie-Antoinette, worth the walk.</li>
<li>the Trianons (small castles)</li>
</ul>

<p>You probably can bundle some of these, I do not know because when I was actually <em>visiting</em> Versailles all of this was free and now I walk or ride on the free part :)</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/h8g7G.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>If you had to make a hard choice I would go for the Hameau de la Reine which is unusual. Still, the castle is nice, the gardens are nice too. It really depends on the time you have.</p>

<p>You can also rent bikes at the entrances of the garden.</p>

<p>There are light and sound concerts in the evenings during spring, summmer and automn - I do not know if they are nice, at least the sound and the fireworks are OK (seen from the outside)</p>

"Travelling as an unmarried Western couple in Indonesia","9785","","<h3>Basically <a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/q/26601/2708"">this question</a> but then for Indonesia.</h3>

<p>In the coming year I (male) plan to travel through Indonesia (Java and Sumatra) with my girlfriend. We will probably travel several weeks, aim to stay in the larger cities, but also plan on several multi-day hikes in the nature where we would camp or sleep in smaller villages.</p>

<p>Indonesia is mostly an Islamic country and <a href=""http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/02/07/aceh-fully-enforces-sharia.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the Shariah law is enforced in Aceh</a>, meaning that at least there one should adjust their behaviour (compared to how couples behave in Western Europe).</p>

<p>How about the other provinces of Java and Sumatra?</p>

<p>To make this question not too specific I am omitting any possible cities we might visit (itinerary is far from set), in the hope that an extended and broad answer is given that is also useful to others visiting these islands.</p>
","<p>I stayed a long time in rural Aceh, so here are my tips:</p>

<p>First of all, do not think of Indonesians as very religious. They are usually traditionalist (some may say conformist). This is different.</p>

<h2>Cover yourself</h2>

<p>You should both wear pants below the knees and real shirt (no tank top), no cleavage, no belly button displayed. Nobody will throw rocks at you if you don't, but they will be more friendly if you do.</p>

<h2>Do not display signs of affection</h2>

<p>Do not kiss in public. Even holding hands should be avoided (same-sex couple, see below). Once again, nobody will throw rocks at you but...</p>

<h2>Unmarried in the same hotel room</h2>

<p>This is legal only if BOTH of you are foreigner.  This is not only Aceh, but the whole Indonesia.<br>
If one of you ""looks like an Indonesian"" expect problems when booking a room. My advice: pretend you are married. If it gets complicated give them any text in the Cyrillic alphabet and say it is a marriage certificate (same-sex couple, see below)</p>

<h2>Note that</h2>

<p>This is also true in the mostly Christian province of North Sumatra (booking a room should be easier.)</p>

<p>In a ""tourist Ghetto"" nobody will have a problem if you drink booze naked in the street (after all, you conform to their idea of a western environment.) But as soon as you go to the nearby village, conform fully to Indonesian standards. Even a bartender or a gogo dancer would be tolerant towards a foreigner, but very strict at home.</p>

<h2>Same sex couple</h2>

<p>Counter intuitively, same-sex couples may have it easy in Indonesia.<br>
Friends (male or female) often hold each other in a way that would look romantic in the western world. Also you can book a room for 2 men/women with no question asked. </p>

","<p>There is no international authority that sets any such limit, nor one which would have the ability to enforce it.</p>

<p>But for most people, it is not practical to maintain too many multiple nationalities. Most countries frown upon multiple citizenships, and place some restrictions on it, at least on paper. Some countries, like Austria, only allow dual citizenship <a href=""http://www.bmeia.gv.at/en/embassy/consulate-general-new-york/practical-advice/austrian-citizenship.html"">from birth</a>, others, like Japan, do not recognize the concept at all, and will <a href=""http://www.moj.go.jp/ENGLISH/information/tcon-01.html"">force you to choose one</a> or relinquish your Japanese citizenship if they find out that you have others. </p>

<p>In other cases, retaining a nationality for a country where you do not reside may not be worth the trouble.

"How safe is public transport in San Francisco for a female travelling alone?","9738","","<p>I am planning to visit San Francisco but I am unsure about public transport reliability and safety, being a lone female traveller.  </p>

<p>How good and safe is public transport in San Francisco? </p>
","<p>It is always hard to tell about safety because people have very different criteria about safety.</p>

<p>Having used the public transportation, buses in particular, in San Francisco, including poorer neighborhoods, I would consider it safe. I am a tall white man though, so the feeling of security might be different.</p>

<p>San Francisco buses are the places that show the variety of the population the most. You can see rich Silicon Valley people with fancy clothes as well as homeless people smelling pee and carrying their home on their back. All this wide range of the society circulates peacefully on the buses, with few altercations in my opinion. The bus drivers in particular are very patient, and seem to have authority on the buses they drive.</p>

<p>At night, you might want to avoid the buses a bit more, depending on your feelings. The bus 91, which tours around the city, is a moving hotel. The bus is filled with homeless people sleeping on the seats. This is still safe to me, no fight or whatever ever happened while I was on the bus but you might not feel as comfortable. </p>

<p>I do not know much about the BART, but I heard incidents may happen at night. Well like everywhere, there are always risks. Regarding the Caltrain, as @Spehro mentioned, it is safe, filled with commuters in general - some with expensive bikes. But I doubt you will use it to visit the area.</p>

<p>Overall, you will be safe, even though I would recommend you not to show off your valuables too much (it is a rule that applies to every public place in the world, in my opinion). If you are not comfortable with poverty, you can as well rely on cabs, faster - but more expensive. My opinion is that I love San Francisco buses for seeing all the society there, I have never seen that anywhere else. I consider it a tourist attraction by itself.</p>

"How do you avoid the hefty toll fee on the French highways?","9706","","<p>Some of the toll fee's on the French highways are hefty. I know that you can avoid them by taking the routes nationales, where some are almost like highways. I don't mind traveling a little bit longer to save money, but the 6 hours to drive 150 km I drove today to save 20 Euro was too much. Is there an easy way to determine when it is worth taking the secondary roads or when it is better to just pay the ""péage"".</p>
","<p>Whether escaping the toll sections is a good idea or not really depends on the place.</p>

<p>So-called ""routes nationales"" (equivalent to the US Routes versus the Interstates) can be narrow winding roads crossing every village in some areas, and close to freeway quality with multiple separated lanes in others.</p>

<p>For example :</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The A65 from Bordeaux to Pau cuts down 1 hour on the equivalent trip using the standard road, although it is one of the most expensives in France. Also, there is the added confort of not having to slow down and care for pedestrians in every town, as well as not being stuck behind a slow truck with no place to pass it.</p></li>
<li><p>The A75, being part of the multiple possible ways to link Paris with the Meditterranean coast, is free from Clermont-Ferrand to the southern end. Also, there is a small toll to cross the Millau viaduct. In addition to the beautiful view, the bridge helps you save more than 1 hour driving down the valley and up on the other side.</p></li>
<li><p>Going down the A10 from Paris to Bordeaux, there is a way to cut down €20 on the toll while keeping the travel time efficient.
Many people exit at Poitiers-Sud and continue on the N10 ""nationale"" which is a divided highway with nearly the same driving confort as on the A10.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Most toll sections in France use a distance approach, where you pick up a ticket upon entering and pay on exit. Do not lose your ticket or the most expensive possible toll will be requested. The tip in the answers above apply, where entering and exiting multiple times can save you some cash.</p>

<p>A few sections, tipically shorter, use simpler, flat-toll barriers placed regularly, known as ""tirelires"" (money banks), with coin baskets. These are more found in the far southwest to the Spanish border, and around Nice. In my experience, it is better to pay the toll because, if you switch to the ""nationale"", you may wander into a good gridlock, especially during summer.</p>

<p>Also, other tips to save money include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Fill up in towns if possible. Gas is more expensive in freeway service area stations. The supermarket stations have better prices, especially Carrefour and Leclerc.</p></li>
<li><p>Rideshare! ""Covoiturage"" in French. This is easy using dedicated websites, where you can announce your trip and let riders join you. One of them is covoiturage.fr; you can set options such as ig you are ready to pick-up/deposit someone en-route, if you listen to music or not, if you accept smokers or not...</p></li>
<li><p>This may sound off-topic, but: Consider taking the train. Saver fares randomly appear, and, in most cases, you will end up paying less for your ticket than adding the cost of gas plus toll. In some cases, the train fare is the corresponding freeway toll alone, or less. Also, using high-speed lines, you can reach your destination quicker.
If you need to drive once there, you can review the ""auto-train"" motorail (car on the train) option or combined rail fare + car rental packages.</p></li>

"Taming the nightmare of public toilets in the UK","9690","","<p>Public toilets in the UK are established and maintained by the local authorities, most commonly <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_in_England"" rel=""noreferrer"">local councils</a>.  This is great for people that advocate local autonomy, but a hellish nightmare for visitors to the UK. For example, the markings and signage differs from council to council. Some councils have maps, others do not. </p>

<p>Essentially there are 300+ different systems that govern about 10,000 public toilets. What is the visitor supposed to do?</p>

<p>Is there a reference available to tourists and family visitors <strong>that gives all of them</strong>? Or most of them?  What can a tourist who wants to be well-prepared for the calls of nature do? </p>

"Is tipping a flight attendant acceptable?","9687","","<p><a href=""http://beyondblindfold.com/29-pilots-and-flight-attendants-confess-the-best-kept-secrets-you-dont-know-about-flying/"">This article</a> is full of supposed ""secrets"" that most everyone knows about flying.  But one thing it mentions is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>14. Tipping could go a long way.</h3>
  
  <p>My girlfriend is a flight attendant. NO ONE tips flight attendants. If you give your FA a fiver with your first drink you’ll probably drink for free the rest of the flight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is tipping a flight attendant acceptable? Is it even permitted? (I know many businesses won't accept tips in the US, for instance, to avoid the legal obligation to report tip income to the IRS.)</p>
","<p>As a flight attendant for years, NO, no one tips flight attendants. Flight attendants are usually paid very well, and in some cases, very very well. They are usually paid per hour in addition to a basic salary and many bonuses for having layovers out of town and other stuff. Tipping them would be considered offensive and an insult in most airlines anyway. Knowing many other flight attendants from many airlines around the world I can assure you that the tipping topic is always a source of amusement when we share stories about that.</p>

<p>If you want an alternative for tipping them, then a commendation letter or if the airline sends a survey after the flight to your email then give some good comments and mention the flight attendant's name.</p>

<p>Another way of tipping them, is using the magic words and asking less :) This is how flight attendants are tipped.</p>

"How can AT&T charge me to use WiFi while I'm abroad?","9682","","<p>Knowing that AT&amp;T is a global network, I was curious about what it would look like to use my phone internationally if they're my carrier. I came across their <a href=""https://www.att.com/shop/en/wireless/international/roaming.html"">Passport Packages information</a>, which states that if I want to use WiFi in another country <em>at all</em> (this was clarified by an AT&amp;T representative) I would have to pay for the $60 package at a minimum.</p>

<p>If AT&amp;T isn't the provider of the WiFi to which I'm trying to connect, how can they charge their customers to use it?</p>
","<p>AT&amp;T can't charge you to use WiFi. From the page you linked to, that's talking about a service where you connect to WiFi somewhere (like an airport) that you might normally have to pay for, and the provider of that WiFi has partnered with AT&amp;T to allow AT&amp;T customers to log in and use the WiFi.</p>

<p>This does not affect your ability to connect to any other public (or private) WiFi system, like a public library in London, your hotel in Hong Kong, or your friend's house in Sydney.</p>

<p>Phone company representatives are trained to encourage you to forget about actual public WiFi, and buy their expensive package to connect to <em>their</em> partners. There's also the possibility that the customer representative you talked to is simply not technically knowledgeable and only knows about what they've been told to say.</p>

"Is there any advantage to checking in for a flight before going to the airport?","9672","","<p>Assume seat selection has already been done, the flight is an international one so the airline may want to see documents, and the passenger is going to check a suitcase.</p>

<p>Is there any advantage to checking in on-line and printing a boarding pass?</p>
","<p>Well, it'll depend, but yes, there are certainly advantages.</p>

<p>Often airlines have bag drop only, if you've checked in online. They'll still check your ID, but it saves you lining up with all the others who still need to go through the check in process.</p>

<p>By checking in early, you're less likely to be bumped - flights oversell regularly, on the assumption a certain percentage won't make it.  As a result, if you really want to make sure you get on the flight, you check in ASAP.</p>

<p>If you've got status, it gives you more time in the lounges, to eat, drink and relax.  It also gives you time to shop, if that floats your boat.</p>

<p>On some carriers (less these days as many charge), by checking in early you have the opportunity to ask nicely for an exit-row seat - usually you can't check in to these online as they have to make sure you're fit and able to comply with the crew in an emergency, so they give them to people in person at bag-drop/checkin.</p>

<p>Some airlines use checkin time as a tie-breaker for upgrades. Generally these days they're stingy and only give it to people with status, but all things being equal, if you checked in first, you may get it.
But perhaps the most important - for international flights - things go wrong. Your taxi doesn't turn up, there's a failure on the train line, you forget something at home and have to go back - all of these have happened to me.  By doing things ahead of time, it's one less moment of stress at the airport, and gives you that extra time you might need. And importantly, if check in has closed when you get there, it's too late to check in, but if you've checked in ahead of time, you have a boarding pass in your hand and can still go through security and try to make your flight.</p>

This strategy involves having a relative or other trusted party placing a large sum of money in the applicant's account temporarily so that the applicant's bank statements look better.

<p>It is the applicant's responsibility to show that funds available for the visit are his and available to him for the visit.  This is stated in <del>Paragraph 41  of the rules </del> (see update below).</p>

<p>In your case it looks like the ECO decided you wanted to appear more prosperous than you are, so you found someone to park money in your account.  Moreover, he was unable to use a previous history to help determine if you are a reliable and compliant person.</p>

<p>Irregular bank transactions need to be carefully documented with paperwork that shows [1] who, [2] what, [3] how, [4] when, and most importantly [5] why.  If you recently sold a house for example, they would want to see the complete transaction history, up to and possibly including the bank statement of the counterpart.  </p>

<p>The only remedy available is to make a fresh application.  You need to prepare the application knowing that your credibility has been damaged and they will apply more scrutiny and caution when they make their decision.</p>

","<blockquote>

<p>As an Indian national you can drive in UAE with International drivers licence or UAE licence. From the official <a href=""http://www.uaeembassy-newdelhi.com/consularservices_FAQ&#39;s.asp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">UAE Embassy New Delhi</a> website:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q32.

  <p>No, you should apply for International Driving License or UAE License.</p>
  
  <p>Q33.
  <strong>Can I drive a private vehicle on my Indian driving License in UAE?</strong></p>
  
  <p>No, but you can obtain a temporary UAE driving license for 6 months
  even if you are not a resident. This can be arranged at the Traffic
  Police Department in each Emirate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Normally IDP (International Driving Permit) acts as a language translation of your driving licence, but still it would be acceptable as I just completed my conversation with <a href=""https://www.thriftyuae.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Thrifty Car Rental UAE</a> and they accept IDP issued from India, therefore IDP would be acceptable to rent a car in UAE.

<p>Therefore you can use you IDP if you are planning to rent a car in UAE, or  should obtain the temporary Dubai driving license from the Traffic Police Office if you wanna use friends car for personal use. Further a foreign driver cannot drive a privately registered car with his International driver license if that car is insured for a United Arab Emirates license holder only. For obtaining the temporary driving license, foreign drivers must go to the Dubai Traffic Department and have following documents: </p>

<p>foreign driving license (the foreign driving license and passport have to be from the same country) and International driver license and their copies;</p>

"Travelling in Taiwan during Chinese New Year? Good or no good?","9641","","<p>I'm planning to arrive in Taiwan on Feb 19th, 2015. I just discovered it coincides with the Chinese New Year. Will this be a tough or frustrating time to travel? I was planning to stay about one week, and I've read that in Mainland China the New Year celebrations last about a week, and that many businesses are closed.</p>

<p>I'm able to change my plans if need be, so good or no good? Travelling in Taiwan at this time?</p>
","<p>Taiwan will have the same week long holiday as the mainland, officially starting on the 18th. The biggest days are the first two: the 18th is new year's eve and the 19th is the first day of the new year. Things will be very busy. People come home from afar to be with their families during the holiday, so the population density goes up significantly.</p>

<p>Whether it will be frustrating depends on you, but difficult is a real possibility. Here are some important things to know:</p>

<ul>
<li>Shops, hotels and restaurants will be open - the cities don't shut down; this is peak travel season - but prices and hours may fluctuate significantly from the norm. For example, a small family run shop might close for the entire holiday, while a fancy banquet restaurant extends hours late into the night to attract partiers. There may be special events or sales, or management might raise prices. Anything that's open will be packed.</li>
<li>Offices, banks, factories and the like will be closed. If the purpose of your trip is business, this is the wrong time to go.</li>
<li>Leisure or tourist centric locations will generally be open (new year's eve and day likely excepted), but will be very busy, because a lot of people are off work and go out to celebrate with their families.</li>
<li>Transportation services will remain open, but will be quite busy. <a href=""http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aeco/201502160006.aspx"">Taiwan schedules extra trains</a> during the holiday to ameliorate the high loads, but expect to feel like a sardine. Ticket prices are marked up a lot on account of high demand. Don't be surprised if they're sold out, even if you're trying to book a week or more in advance.</li>
<li>If you don't have a hotel booked already, it will be nigh impossible to get one at this point, and very expensive if you do.</li>
<li>There's a relative lull in travelling during the middle of the holiday. Relative to the start and end, that is; it's still <em>much</em> busier than the rest of the year.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, this is a <strong>wonderful</strong> time to experience the local culture. It simply does not get more festive than the lunar new year celebration. You will not be hurting for excellent things to see, do and eat.</p>

<p>I was wondering if camping out in the wild is permitted anywhere in japan, like it is in Scandinavia. I don't mind about the costs, but I just like the solitude and the idea of pitching your tent wherever you want.</p>

","<p>Japan does not have a general ""<a href=""https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Right_to_access"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">right to access</a>"" like Scandinavian countries, wild camping on public land is theoretically illegal and wild camping on private property requires the landowner's permission.</p>

I've done this a few times and never had a problem, just pitch your tent late and head out early, or ask permission.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wnyt1.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here"">

  <p>This means that shops no longer have to accept the notes, and <strong>it is up to banks whether they agree to swap notes</strong> after this date. </p>
  
  <p>[...]</p>
  
  <p>After June 30 if a bank or building society refuses to swap a note, consumers have the right to swap the notes at the Bank of England itself. The Bank promises that it will honour the face value of any note issued, even notes from before the Second World War. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The quote is coming from 2010. I wonder what is the reality about accepting the notes now? Except the mentioned swap at the Bank of England as the article suggests, can the notes be used in everyday (esp. tourist) situations: can the old notes be used in shops, including in airport shops, to buy train tickets? Would a taxi driver accept them? Would I be able to swap them at other banks, not just the Bank of England, is it something doable right in the airport on arrival?</p>

<p>Also - this is already not a part of the question, rather bonus reading - here in Ukraine in one of the state banks I was told that they cannot accept Elgar £20 notes exactly for the reason that they are withdrawn. To top my GBP account I could only use <a href=""http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/Pages/current/default.aspx"">current banknotes</a>.</p>
","<p>I cannot give you an official answer [there is no official answer] but I think you will not have much trouble exchanging it eventually, even if you are rejected a few times.</p>

<p>In most places a £20 note does not receive much scrutiny. Taxi drivers and sole traders may be reluctant; someone at an airport shop, a restaurant or a bar probably won't look very closely.</p>

"What are the ""rules"" for multi-city flights?","9601","","<p>As I understand things, airlines generally give discounts for round-trips that consist of a flight from A to B followed by a flight from B to A.  How does this logic work for multi-city flights?  As an example (but don't focus strictly on this example), what about a flight from A to B followed by a flight from C back to A?  What logic is applied to determine whether to charge as separate one-way trips or as a discounted multi-city trip?

<p>I know I can prod travel search engines for specific examples, but if I understand the rules it can help in my search.  Is this airline dependent?  Does it matter whether the flights are domestic or international (I'm only concerned here about domestic)?</p>
","<p>What you're describing is called an ""Open Jaw"" ticket, and there's a very simple rule for determining if it applies or not.</p>

<p>Lets say you're flying A-B and then C-A.</p>

<p>There's 3 distances involved here - A-B, B-C (ie, the overland segment) and C-A.  For a ticket to be a valid ""open jaw"", the distance B-C needs to be shorter than both A-B and C-A.</p>

<p>eg, SFO-STL (1735 miles) and ORD-SFO (1846 miles) is a valid open jaw as the distance between the two cities is 258 miles, which is less than both of the flown legs.</p>

<p>SFO-LAS (414 miles) and DEN-SFO (967 miles) is NOT a valid open jaw routing, as the distance between LAS and DEN is 628 miles, which is greater than one of the flown legs.</p>

<p>For US domestic flights, it often doesn't matter if it's a valid open jaw or not.  Many domestic flights are sold on a ""one-way"" basis, so it doesn't matter if your flights are a valid open jaw or not - or even if they are purchased on the same ticket or not - they will cost the same as in effect you're just paying for 2 one-way fares.  Some fares do specify that they are only available for return or open-jaw, and that's when these rules do come into play.</p>

<p>For international flights, open jaw can make a huge difference to fares, as most cheap fares are not available one-way, they are only available as part of a return or open jaw ticket.</p>

"Is there any practical reason to mention marital status in the passport?","9583","","<p>I am about to renew my passport, and I got married since my last renewal.  My country offers the option to include the marital status in the passport (my spouse and I chose not to change our family names).</p>

<p>Is there any practical advantage when the passport indicates the name of the spouse?  I am thinking of situations such as customs &amp; immigration, or perhaps common stays in hotels in areas where hotel rooms can only be shared by married couples.</p>
","<p>I have never encountered a situation, where it would be an advantage.</p>

<p>Marital status field in the passport is not required or recommended by international standards, including those of ICAO. When proof of marital status is needed by the authorities, for example, for immigration purposes, they have a standard set of documents to provide as proof thereof, and the primary document for that is of course a marriage certificate. I think that it may be easier in most cases to show the marriage certificate instead of explaining that you also have that information in the passport. Marital status information in the passport may in some cases not be even considered as proper proof of that, unless specifically decided by court or relatively high-ranking official.</p>

<p>Unless required by local law, a major brand name hotel would not require you to provide proof of marriage. In some countries such as Qatar and Morocco, unmarried persons of opposite sex cannot share a room by law, but even there the best hotels don't require such proof from foreign guests.</p>

<p>If your passport only indicates that you are married, but does not mention the name of your spouse, if you are required to prove that you and your wife are married, that does not seem to be useful. In case of customs and immigration, they would probably want to see a document that shows the name of your spouse and not just your marital status. In case of hotels, <em>if</em> it happens that they require proof that you are married with the person, with whom you want to share your room, that would seem not useful as well, as you could be hypothetically travelling with your girlfriend, sister, or inviting a local female guest to your room. (Especially if you and your spouse did not change names.)</p>

<p>To summarize, I think that having the marital status indicated in your passport would not be useful, especially since the name of your spouse would not be indicated in the passport and especially that you and your spouse did not change names. If you think or know that you will be required to present proof of marriage, I would recommend bringing your marriage certificate with you (properly translated if necessary). Perhaps you can avoid hotels, where proof of marriage is required from foreign guests, but if the hotel, where you will be staying, requires such proof, it would be a safer bet to take your marriage license with you.</p>

<p>Furthermore, your passport is already a document with quite a lot of personally identifiable information, which is often used (especially for travel and international business), and copies of the passport may be taken for various reasons. Perhaps you would feel more comfortable if your passport contained as little personally identifiable information as possible in order to minimize the opportunities for identity theft.</p>

"PPBM: What happens if you check in luggage and then miss the flight?","9573","","<p>My partner and I are due to take an international flight together.</p>

<p>For reasons beyond our control, my partner may not be able to make the flight.  I've read other questions about this scenario and it seems straightforward.  Loss of ticket for not checking in, simple.</p>

<p>There is an outside chance that my partner's ability to make the flight may be decided at the last-minute.  Obviously, I <em>should</em> make a decision as to whether I want to go without them <em>before</em> I check my luggage in.  But I'm curious, <strong>what happens if I check the luggage in and then miss the flight?</strong></p>

<p>This, to me, seems like a classic terrorist opportunity, so there must be a sensible outcome in this scenario.  Although, my luggage would not have anything that would flag it as dangerous, obviously.  I imagine my particular scenario may not be uncommon, e.g. passenger arrives at the airport sick, checks in, and then doesn't make it to the terminal (stuck in the toilet, etc.)</p>

<p>I've read about <a href=""http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/opre.49.2.181.13529"">Positive Passenger Bag Matching</a>, but they wouldn't know until the boarding closes, which seems quite late and incredibly inconvenient if they decided to remove the bag.</p>

<p><strong>What happens to the luggage?</strong></p>

<p><strong>What would happen to me?  Would they give me a fine or arrest me or something?</strong></p>

<p>Obviously international flights make you go through passport control.  <strong>Is this scenario any different for a domestic flight?</strong></p>
","<p>PPBM, or ""Positive Passenger Bag Matching"" in an international airline regulation that was introduced after the Pan Am 103 bombing, and basically requires that a passenger may not cause their checked baggage to fly on an aircraft they are not on, on the grounds that they would not blow up a plane if they knew they were on board and thus would be killed as well.</p>

<p>PPBM does NOT require that baggage must fly on the same aircraft as the passenger, just that the passenger may not be the one to cause that to happen.  So for example, if your bag is accidentally not loaded onto a flight by the airline, it may travel on a later flight as the decision to do so would not have been made by the passenger.</p>

<p>However if a passenger fails to board a flight that they have checked luggage on, PPBM regulations require that either the passenger is found and boards the flight, or their luggage is removed.  This removal of luggage can be a long process depending on where it is loaded on the aircraft, and may potentially require unloading other luggage or cargo in order to find the bag(s).  As a result, it's almost guaranteed that having to do this will cause the flight to be delayed, and in doing so inconvenience all of the other passengers, and potentially cost the airline money.</p>

<p>PPBM is required for all international flights.  Domestic rules will depend on the country involved, but for example the US does NOT enforce PPBM on domestic flights due to the fact that ALL passenger bags are checked for explosives using X-rays and other techniques.  The rules in other countries will vary.</p>

<p>So to answer your specific questions - what happens to the luggage?  It will be unloaded and retained by the airline.  You would need to work with the airline to reclaim it or make other plans (such as being booked onto a later flight, in which case the luggage would be moved to that flight).  If your travel included domestic flights (either only domestic, or domestic before your international flight) then your bag would potentially travel to the (domestic) destination - at which point it would be up to the airline to decide what to do but likely would involve you having to pay to transport it back to you.</p>

<p>What happens to you?  In a general sense, nothing.  If missing the flight was deliberate you will almost certainly lose the value of your ticket.  If it was accidental the airline may assist in moving you to a later flight, although in many cases they have no obligation to do so.  Nothing here is ""illegal"" as such, and I would not expect any legal implications in general, however that could vary significantly depending on the country involved and the exact reason for you not taking the flight.</p>

<p>What would happen to the other passengers on the plane?  You didn't ask this one, but the answer is that they will almost certainly be delayed as a result of your actions. Depending on the length of the delay, this could cause them to miss connecting flights or other appointments.</p>

<p>In short, don't do this.  If it happens accidentally (eg, you fall asleep in the airport and miss you flight) then so be it - but doing anything like this deliberately would be a poor move on your behalf.</p>

<p>Note that if you are travelling with someone else (presuming you are both on the same booking) and one of you boards, then there are a few added complications.  Firstly, once they realize that your companion has boarded but you have not, they will question that person as to where you are.  It is unlikely that they will remove that person from the flight, but it's possible.</p>

<p>Presuming you check-in together (or possibly even if you don't) it's possible that the baggage will end up being checked under the other passengers name, or their baggage being checked under your name.  Thus it's possible that their bags will be removed, but that yours will fly (or some other random combination).</p>

<p>If the situation ever did occur where you needed to remove yourself from the flight after check-in, the only right option is to go to the airline IMMEDIATELY and let them know.  This will give them additional time to find your bag (preferably before it's even placed on the aircraft), will likely avoid delaying the flight, and will make everyones life - including yours - much easier.</p>

"Are ice hotels actually comfortable to sleep in?","9560","","<p>I've always been interested in visiting the Ice Hotel at Jukkasjärvi here in Sweden, but the combination of cold &amp; possibly hard ""beds"" has so far managed to put me off. </p>

<p>I'd like to hear from someone who has actual experience of staying in one - if the cold is really staved off by the sleeping bags/furs/etc, and if it's actually comfortable to sleep there. </p>
","<p>Possibly one of the clearest comments about it comes from <a href=""http://www.icehotel.com/uk/ICEHOTEL/Stay-at-ICEHOTEL/How-to-sleep-well-in-minus-5-degrees/"">this piece</a> written about the ice hotels:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When checking in to the cold accommodation, you'll get a key to your
  own locker where you can store your clothes as you change to your
  sleeping attire. If you're staying in a suite, you'll get access to
  your own small changing room where you can leave your outdoor clothes.</p>
  
  <p>When it's time to go to bed, you pick up a sleeping bag and sheets
  from the reception desk in the warm building connected to the
  ICEHOTEL.  You can choose between single or double sleeping bags. For
  a good night's sleep, we recommend sleeping in thermal underwear (such
  as a long-johns and long-sleeved undershirt) and a hat. Preferably
  woollen.  </p>
  
  <p>Your luggage will be stored in a locked luggage room during your stay.
  If you bring it to your room, it will freeze during the night.</p>
  
  <p>You'll find warm bathrooms, showers and a sauna in the warm building
  connected to the ICEHOTEL. If you need to use the bathroom during the
  night, you'll have to get out of your sleeping bag and go the warm
  building. So here's a tip; don't drink too much coffee before going to
  bed.  </p>
  
  <p>The bed you'll sleep on is made of blocks of ice, a wooden base and a
  mattress covered with reindeer skin. Instead of a door, you pull a
  curtain in front of it. The snow walls are very sound isolating, so a
  loudly snoring neighbour will not keep you awake.</p>
  
  <p>Around 7.30 am, you will be awoken by one of our guides and served hot
  lingonberry juice by the bed. In the warm building, you can enjoy a
  warm morning sauna before going to ICEHOTEL Restaurant for breakfast.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it would seem there are both warm and cold parts, and you will sleep in the cold part, but be adequately padded and protected.</p>

"Is it safe to drink tap water in Seoul?","9545","","<p>I've been hearing conflicting views. The government assures everyone that it's okay but the locals don't seem to trust the government, at least in this issue. Does anybody know any conclusive reference that states that the drinking water in Seoul is potable?</p>
","<p>Historically Seoul has had a number of issues with drinking water.  Most recently the issue wasn't the water itself, but the pipes that delivered it, which many people claimed introduced contaminates.  I can still remember being told by someone I was working with there about 10 years ago that the water was safe to drink in my hotel, but not in their office block located a few blocks away - I'm still not sure exactly how he came to that conclusion!</p>

<p>Over recent years the local government-run water supplier has made significant efforts to replace all of the ""old"" pipes, and has taken additional measures around treatment of water.</p>

<p>The water is considered safe and drinkable under UN criteria, and although many locals still do not trust it, there's little doubt that it's as safe as tap water in any other major first-world city.</p>

<p>There's numerous more information available on <a href=""http://arisu.seoul.go.kr/sudo_eng/index.jsp"" rel=""nofollow"">The Office of Waterworks, Seoul Metropolitan Government</a> website.</p>

<p>Note that all of the above comments relate to the water in Seoul.  If you're heading outside of the main metropolitan area then things could be very different and I would suggest only drinking bottled water in those areas.</p>

<p>During the trip you will cross many time zones, so it is not feasible to constantly change your watch every time you cross into a new time zone. But how do you convey to passengers what time lunch will be served, and what time the evenings play will begin?</p>

<p>Are the timings of breakfast/lunch/dinner etc staggered to fit in with the daylight cycles? i.e is breakfast served from sunrise, even if that means it is 5pm? </p>
","<p>From at least <a href=""http://cruisediva.com/going_ashore4.htm"">one authority on the topic</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether clocks stay set on ""ship"" time or are changed as the vessel
  moves through time zones depends on the ship, the itinerary, and the
  time of year</p>
</blockquote>

<p>so it'll depend on the company you use, and the zone of the ship and where it travels during the tour.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most ships adhere to the time zone they are in and clocks are set
  forward or back to adhere to local time. Passengers are also advised
  to change their watches to the 'correct' time—there is usually a
  reminder card on your pillow before you go to bed. However, not all
  ships do that, particularly in the Caribbean! Some ships stay on
  ""ship"" time, which can be different from ""island"" time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the best authority is the ship itself, and they'll know from experience that people get it wrong, and will do their best to ensure you don't miss the boat.  </p>

<p>From friends who have travelled on a cruise ship in the Mediterranean, breakfast and lunch could be literally 'whenever we wanted' - there was often a buffet.  </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.wdwinfo.com/wdwinfo/cruise-new/cr-dining.htm#seatingassignments"">Disney, for example</a> has seating times for dinner that you can request, and for breakfast, say, on their ship <a href=""http://disneycruise.disney.go.com/ships-activities/ships/wonder/dining/beach-blanket-buffet/"">The Wonder</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Properly cooked foods. Everything heated to a proper internal temperature (depends on the dish, check the USDA's site for guidelines), no sampling the raw chicken dish, etc.</li>
<li>For fruits and veg, if you can't peel it, don't eat it. A tremendous number of GI outbreaks are due to fruit and veg, rather than meat. This includes things like salads - since you can't really peel lettuce, avoid it.</li>
<li>Check if the local water is safe. When in doubt, assume it isn't. You can stick to bottled water, though there's always the distinct chance its being bottled from a contaminated source. Coke/Pepsi etc., and beer are good alternatives. Little known fact, the Coca-Cola company is hugely involved in clean water programs worldwide, because they need it for their product.</li>
<li>Ice. Ice is bad. Its probably made using the local tap-water, and there are many beasties that can survive an encounter with an ice machine.</li>
</ol>

<p>But when it comes down to it, nearly every traveller makes some sort of safe-eating ""mistake"" fairly frequently, whether they realize it or not. At the end of the day, your best bet is to talk to your travel physician, and see if you can get a prescription for an antibiotic. Using that in combination with something like Imodium will probably keep your trip mostly on track - shutting down the problem long enough for the antibiotics to treat the source. Unless of course its viral - norovirus, rotavirus etc. In that event, best of luck.</p>

"Renting a car in Ireland & Great Britain: 1 rental or 2?","9413","","<p>My wife, two kids and I will be traveling in Ireland and the UK Nov. 1st through 21st. We're flying into and out of Dublin. Our plan is to do a clockwise tour: Fly into Dublin -> Belfast -> Scotland -> England/London -> Back to Dublin to fly home.</p>

<p>We've been planning to rent a car when we land in Dublin (doing just things outside Dublin at the start of the trip) and have a car all the way until London, then turn in the car and take a train/ferry to get back to Dublin before flying home.</p>

<p>However, reading through the car rental section of Rick Steve's 2012 Ireland book is causing us to question if this is the right plan.  He says (p. 480):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If your trip covers both Ireland and Great Britain, you're better off
  with two separate car rentals, rather than paying for your car to ride
  the ferry between the two islands. On an all-Ireland trip, you can
  drive your rental car from the Republic of Ireland into Northern
  Ireland, but be aware of drop-off charges ($75-150) if you return it
  in the North.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it seems like he recommends against doing one car rental for both islands, but he also recommends against renting in the Republic of Ireland and returning it in Northern Ireland (our other option for our current itinerary).  So we're not sure which is best here.  A few questions about this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If we do one car rental all the way from Dublin to London, will there be a similar $75-$150 fee?</p></li>
<li><p>Is there an easy place to return a car on the Northern Ireland side of one of the Northern Ireland -> Scotland ferries, and an easy place on the Scotland side to rent a car?  We'd like to minimize the number of buses/whatever we need to take between car rentals since we'll be lugging around car seats for both of our children (on top of carrying them and our luggage).</p></li>
<li><p>Will one way be significantly cheaper than the other?  Besides the basic cost of taking the car on the ferry and the drop-off charges, our credit card will cover insurance in Scotland/England but not in Ireland, so we could potentially get a better rental rate by renting a second vehicle once we're on Great Britain. Although, I know you often get a better rate when keeping a car rental for longer, so that may negate any benefit from the credit card covering the insurance.</p></li>
</ul>
","<ul>
<li><p>There probably will be a one-way rental fee between Ireland and the UK. For example, Hertz describe theirs in general terms <a href=""https://www.hertz.co.uk/rentacar/byr/index.jsp?targetPage=eurihlit.jsp?leftNavUserSelection=globNav_3_5_1&amp;selectedRegion=Europe"">here</a> (<strong>update</strong>: it looks to be around ~1000 EUR+ for Ireland to the UK). I know from past experience that Hertz, for example, will show you the applicable one-way rental fee as part of the costing if you plan a reservation on their website (you don't need to actually book it). I assume other rental companies are similar. You can also use this to compare the one-way rental in one direction and the other.</p></li>
<li><p>Most major rental companies will have offices in city centres in Ireland, NI, and the UK mainland, and typically the largest (with the most choice and best opening hours) will be near airports, ferry terminals, and major train stations (the latter in turn typically being in city centres).</p></li>
<li><p>Be careful about the credit card covering your car rental insurance. I'm assuming you're from the US, where this kind of thing is typical. Make 100% sure it covers the insurance abroad, too - it might well not do. This concept doesn't typically exist in the UK, for example, so most people buy the add-on insurance from the rental company. I'm not sure about the situation in Ireland.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I think your best option is probably to rent one car for Ireland/NI (checking on the one-way fee), and another for the UK. Failing that, I think the second best option is to keep the same car all the way from Dublin back to Dublin. Either way, watch for costs in London from the <a href=""http://www.tfl.gov.uk/roadusers/congestioncharging/"">Congestion Charge</a> and Parking (an example national chain you can use for representative costs is <a href=""http://www.ncp.co.uk/"">here</a>). </p>

"Are there electrical plugs and/or wifi in Japanese shinkansen?","9409","","<p>Do the Shinkansen trains have wifi? How about electrical plugs?</p>

<p>If it depends on the train, these are the ones I'll be taking:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hikari 546 (Hiroshima->Shin-Kobe)</li>
<li>Hikari 470 (Shin-Kobe->Tokyo)</li>
<li>Max Toki 329 (Tokyo&lt;->Niigata)</li>
</ul>

<p>I'd also accept as an answer an online resource where I can look all this up (I failed to find one on my own).</p>
","<p>There is indeed very little information about this online.</p>

<p>A question asked prior to 2003 on the site 'www.h2.dion.ne.jp' (no longer online):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q: Do shinkansen trains have power outlet sockets for running laptop
  computers?  </p>
  
  <p>A: Generally, no, although the latest 700 series trains
  running on JR West Hikari Rail Star services do have power outlet
  sockets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/700_Series_Shinkansen"">Wikipedia</a> confirms that the most 700 series models have power outlets for passengers.</p>

<ul>
<li>Hikari 546 is a N700 which have power outlets.</li>
<li>Hikari 470 is a 700 which most likely have power outlets.</li>
<li>Max Toki 329 seems to be an E4 series which is not likely to have
power outlets.</li>
</ul>

<p>Only the N700 trains between Tokyo and Osaka have Wifi, and you still have to pay for it before you board the train using one of the Japanese carriers like <a href=""http://300.wi2.co.jp/"">Wi2</a> or <a href=""http://www.hotspot.ne.jp/en/"">Hotspot</a></p>
