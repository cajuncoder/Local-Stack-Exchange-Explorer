"How to correct a mistake made when writing a check?","245438","","<p><em>I think I know the answer to this, but I'm not sure, and it's a good question, so I'll ask:</em></p>

<p><strong>What is the accepted/proper way to correct a mistake made on a check?</strong></p>

<p>For instance, I imagine that in any given January, some people accidentally date a check in the previous year.</p>

<p>Is there a way to correct such a mistake, or must a check be voided (and wasted)?  Pointers to definitive information (U.S., Canada, and elsewhere) are helpful.</p>
","<p>From working in a bank:
Void the check and write a new one.</p>

<p>Any change, even if initialed, could be considered suspicious, and cause for the bank to refuse to accept the check (they may still accept it at their discretion).  It's better to be safe than sorry, so write out a new check that is correct.</p>

"Should I pay off my credit card online immediately or wait for the bill?","228469","","<p>I'm a college student and I just got my first credit card (through Chase). The only reason I got the card is to try and build my credit score. I also have a checking account with Chase, and they let me pay off my credit card any time I want.</p>

<p>For example, right now I have a balance of $92 on my credit card, but my bill won't come until September 2, and the payment isn't actually due until September 27. But through their website I could go ahead and pay it off with money from my checking account.</p>

<p>My question is, is it better for my credit score if I pay off that $92 balance right now, or should I wait for the bill, or does it not matter either way?</p>
","<p>It does not matter.
Your credit score is affected by late payments, by credit usage and by age of credit.</p>

<p>DO NOT PAY LATE. </p>

<p>Paying early is only good in that it means you don't pay late.</p>

<p>Your credit usage is calculated by percentage of the credit you have that you actually use.  Keep your usage to under 20% of your limit and you look great as a credit risk as you have lots of buffer. </p>

"Can I trust the Motley Fool?","219800","","<p>A while back I checked out <a href=""http://www.fool.com"">The Motley Fool</a> while doing some research on mutual funds.

","<p>I found the information I was looking for at the <strong>Ontario Ministry of Finance.</strong> Refer to <a href=""http://www.fin.gov.on.ca/en/budget/ontariobudgets/2009/chpt3.html#table2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">table 2 in the Ontario Budget 2009: Chapter III: Reforming Ontario's Tax and Pension Systems</a>.  Here's an excerpt with my emphasis added:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aSAjx.png"" alt=""Table 2 - Ontario Sales Tax Transition Benefit"">  </p>
  
  <p><strong>Benefits would be delivered to
  eligible Ontario tax filers aged 18
  and over in each of June 2010,
  December 2010 and June 2011, totalling
  a maximum of $300 for single people
  and $1,000 for single parents and
  couples.</strong> Each maximum benefit would be
  reduced by five per cent of the
  recipients’ previous year’s adjusted
  family net income over $80,000 for
  single individuals and over $160,000
  for families. <strong>To qualify for the two
  benefits in 2010, a 2009 tax return
  would have to be filed, and a 2010 tax
  return would have to be filed for the
  June 2011 benefit.</strong> About 6.5 million
  individuals and families in Ontario
  would receive sales tax transition
  benefits.</p>
  
  <p>A single person with no children and
  income of up to $80,000 would receive
  a benefit of $100 in each of June
  2010, December 2010 and June 2011. The
  maximum benefit would be reduced by
  five per cent of income over $80,000,
  so a single person with income of
  $81,000, for example, would receive
  three benefits of $50 each. Single
  people with income over $82,000 would
  not receive a benefit.</p>
  
  <p>A family with income of up to $160,000
  would receive three benefits: $330 in
  June 2010, $335 in December 2010 and
  $335 in June 2011. The maximum
  benefits would be reduced by five per
  cent of family income over $160,000,
  so a family with income of $163,000,
  for example, would receive one benefit
  payment of $180 and two benefit
  payments of $185 each. Families with
  income over $166,700 ($166,600 for the
  June 2010 benefit) would not receive a
  benefit.<br>
  ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the last point now in the question, regarding who gets the rebates in the case of a couple, I found the answer at the Ontario Ministry of Revenue (second link below):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To qualify for the OSTTB, you are required to file a 2009 income tax return for the June
  2010 and December 2010 payments, and a 2010 return for the June 2011 payment. If both
  you and your spouse or common-law partner file a tax return, <strong>the benefit payments will
  be made to the individual whose return is assessed by the CRA first.</strong></p>

</ul>

<p>Here's some of the basic eligibility information from the second link (OSTTB) just above:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the June 2010 benefit payment you
  must:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>be a resident of Canada on
  December 31, 2009 and file a 2009
  income tax return by April 30, 2011;
  or if you were not a resident of
  Canada on December 31, 2009, provide a
  statement of 2009 world income to CRA,
  by April 30, 2011</p></li>
  <li><p>be 18 years of age or older or

"What happens if I deposit a check and forget to endorse it with my signature on the back?","184757","","<p>What if I deposit a check into a Bank of America ATM but forget to endorse it with my signature on the back of the check?</p>
","<p>If a bank employee catches it then typically they would call you and ask you to come in to sign the check. If they can't get a hold of you they would probably mail it back to you. There is a chance that they won't catch in which case it would just be deposited into your account like any other check.</p>
","10571"
"What is the purpose of endorsing a check?","161984","","<p>Why do you need to sign a check on the back when you deposit it to your account?</p>
","<p>I actually had to go to the bank today and so I decided to ask.</p>

<p>The answer I was given is that a check is a legal document (a promise to pay).  In order to get your money from the bank, you need to sign the check over to them.  By endorsing the check you are attesting to the fact that you have transferred said document to them and they can draw on that account.</p>

"Why is there a delay on credit card transactions showing up on my online statement?","150648","","<p>If I make a purchase with my credit card there is a delay of a few days before it shows up on my online statement.</p>

<p>If I make a purchase with my debit card it usually is displayed that day.</p>

<p>Why the delay with a credit card statement?</p>
","<p>It all depends on the merchant. When you charge your card the information goes through but it waits for the merchant to send the info/confirm the charge before it shows up on your online activity.</p>

<p>For example: I use Intuit to accept CC payments. When I charge an Amex the info is sent to Amex on the spot which is why your credit limit updates immediately but Amex then waits for a confirmation. Intuit actually handles the entire process which is probably how all CC processing services work.</p>

<p>When you use your debit card in a debit transaction you are withdrawing cash from your checking account, which is in part why debit transactions do not have the same security as credit.</p>

<p>Another note about debit cards and referring to mhoran_psprep comment - <code>""it takes 2 or three days for the debit card transaction to appear""</code> this is because you are using your debit card as a credit transaction, many bank cards offer this and it can come with added benefits.

<p>The money is not too  much, less than 50 thousand us dollars.</p>

<p>Can foreigners holding US tourist visa create a bank account in USA?</p>
","<p>The answer is, unfortunately, along the lines of ""it depends"". It does depend a little on the bank - I've had a US bank account for years before moving to the US, and I didn't have an SSN or any status when I opened the account. What I did have however was an address in the US that they could send the statements to, and proof that I was living abroad (oh, and US citizen wife that had an account with the same bank).</p>

<p>Not all banks will open a bank account for a foreigner with no status in the US, but it is generally possible. You will have to check with several banks and basically have paperwork showing your foreign address and proof of id (passport, possibly a drivers license as well).</p>

"Are BIC and SWIFT code the same things?","140994","","<p>I'm helping a friend with submitting an expenses claim to a US organisation we're both involved with. As the money is coming from a US bank, we can't just give them an IBAN and a BIC and be done with it. Instead, we've got to supply full swift details.</p>

<p>My bank publishes <a href=""http://www.lloydstsb.com/contact_us/frequently_asked_questions_contact_us.asp#swift"">their swift code</a>. Comparing that to the BIC on my statement, it's similar, but different. (The BIC I've been told is 3 characters longer, and the 4th character from the end is not the same as the last character in the Swift code.)</p>

<p>Answers.com <a href=""http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_difference_between_SWIFT_and_BIC_codes"">claims</a> that Swift and BIC codes are the same thing, and that's what my friend was told when she asked her bank for its swift details. My bank however disagrees...</p>

<p>That makes me think that some banks have their Swift and BIC codes be the same, but that isn't required. Anyone know if that's the case?</p>
","<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBAN"" rel=""noreferrer"">IBAN</a> -> is International Bank Account Number. The number is constructed in such a way that it uniquely identifies your account in the world. I.e. it has a country in it, Bank (and branch) and the actual account number. This is an international standard adopted by the EU, Australia and NZ. Going forward it would be sufficient to just quote the IBAN for payment without any other details.</p>

<p>BIC, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWIFT_Code"" rel=""noreferrer"">SWIFT Code</a>, SWIFT BIC, SWIFT ID [all mean the same] is a Bank Identifier Code [More correctly Business Identifier Code] that is again an International standard and used on all International payments. The SWIFT BIC is constructed as  </p>

<ul>
<li>4 Chars Bank Code [As issued by SWIFT]   </li>
<li>2 Chars of Country Code [ISO Country Code standard]   </li>
<li>2 Chars of Location Code [Issued by SWIFT in consultation with country]   </li>
<li>3 Chars of Branch Code decided by the individual Bank [This is optional]</li>
</ul>

<p>Hence SWIFT BIC can be 8 Chars or 11 Chars. The additional 3 Chars help bank identify the Branch where the account is held and where the payment needs to be made.</p>

<p>So LOYDGB2L is the main head office </p>

<ul>
<li>BIC LOYD-> Lloyds TSB</li>
<li>GB-> Great Britain</li>
<li>2L->London</li>
</ul>

<p>If your branch is, say, in Canary Wharf, the SWIFT BIC would be LOYDGB21 [21-> Canary Wharf] with a 3 digit branch added.</p>

","<blockquote>
  <p>Number A is my credit card number. The 4 groups don't have a meaning.</p>

<p>They do, actually. First digit is 4 for VISA, 5 for Mastercard, 6 for Discover/Diners Club, 3 for American Express/Diners Club (those are shorter than 16).</p>

<p>Also, first 6 digits for Visa and Mastercard are code numbers for the issuing institution. By these 6 digits anyone can know which institution issued the card, and what type of card it is (debit/credit, premiere or not, etc).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Number B: I have no idea. Might me my security code?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a security measure. These 4 digits must match the first 4 digits of your card number (the first 4 digits of the issuer code. The last 2 are card types for the issuer, though some different issuers may share the first 4 as well and only differ by the last 2). Amex cards don't have this (I'm not sure about Discover).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Number C is my security code.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, this is called CVC or CVV2. It is used for card-not-present transactions. The purpose of the code is to verify that a payment card is actually in the hands of the cardholder/merchant, for example when using the card over the internet or phone. </p>

<p>On American Express cards this is 4 digits, and they appear on the front of the card.</p>

<blockquote>

","<p>The bank will make this even more confusing because they use the terms from their own perspective.</p>

<p><strong>From the bank's perspective</strong>  (printed on your statements)<br>
  <strong>credit</strong>: Money into your account  (increases the bank's liabilities)<br>
  <strong>debit</strong>: Money out of your account  (decrease bank liabilities)</p>

<p><strong>From your perspective:</strong><br>
It depends on the nature of the transfer of money, but here are the most common for a personal account.<br>
Income into your account: <strong>Credit</strong><br>
Expenses out of your account: <strong>Debit</strong><br>
Payment on a loan made for an asset (house/car): <strong>Credit</strong> for the loan account, <strong>debit</strong> for the equity account for the car/house/etc.</p>

<p>Yes, it's complicated. Neither credits nor debits are always a + or -. That's why I agree with the advice of the others here that double-entry accounting is overkill for your personal finances.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I simplified the above examples for the purpose of clarity. Technically every transaction in double entry accounting includes both a credit and a debit (hence the ""double"" in the name). In fact, sometimes a transaction involves more than one credit or debit, but always at least one of each. Also, this is for EACH party. So any transaction between you and your bank involves at least FOUR debits and/or credits when all involved are considered.</p>

","<p>The two banks involved may have different policies about honoring the check. It might not be written on the check. </p>

<p>Your bank may decide that the stale check has to be treated differently and will withhold funds for a longer period of time before giving you access to the money. They will give time for the first bank to refuse to honor the check. They may be concerned about insufficient funds, the age of the check, and the fact that the original account could have been closed.</p>

<p>If you are concerned about the age of the check. You could go to your bank in person, instead of using deposit by ATM, scanner, or smart phone. This allows you to talk to a knowledgeable person. And if they are going to treat the check differently or reject the check, they can let you know right away.</p>

<p>The audit may not have been concerned about the fact that the check hadn't been cashed because when they did the audit the check was still considered fresh. Some companies will contact you eventually to reissue the check so you they can get the liability off their books. </p>

<p>If the bank does refuse the check contact the company to see how you can get a replacement check issued. They may want proof the check can't be cashed so they don't have to worry about paying you twice.</p>

","<p>You can technically initiate an ACH transaction (debit or credit) with just the routing number and the account number. As a consumer - most banks will not allow you doing this without some sort of verification of authority. But if you have a direct ACH access (like many billers do) - you can do that and nothing will stop you.</p>

<p>You can also print checks with the account/routing info on them and use them.</p>

<p>That said - these actions are illegal and reversible. People who do this are usually making ""sting"" operations where they deposit forged checks and withdraw the money in cash quickly, before the check bounces back as a fake. The loss is then on the bank that allowed them depositing the checks (that's why new accounts usually have much longer holds on deposits than older established ones).</p>

<p>If for some reason I have an expense that is greater than 50% of the credit limit and I pay by credit card, and then transfer the money to the credit card account immediately, will the higher utilization still affect my credit score?</p>
","<p><strong>No, it won't affect your score until your statement is posted.</strong> Paying your bill before your statement is posted is actually a good way to keep your credit utilization low. If you're worried about high credit utilization negatively affecting your credit score, consider paying your bill several times a month to ensure that when your final monthly statement is posted, your utilization is still low. When my credit limit was very low while I was in college, I did this almost every month, and I've seen other sites recommend this practice as well.</p>

<p>From <a href=""https://www.creditkarma.com/article/credit-card-utilization"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">creditkarma.com</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The easiest way [to lower credit utilization] is to make credit card payments more than once a month so that your balance never gets too high.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Consider making payments to creditors more than once each month. Otherwise, if you put a major expense -- like a new appliance -- on a credit card, even if you plan to pay it off, your FICO score may take a hit. The reason is that credit scores are calculated as a snapshot in time, so if that happens to be right after you charged a new $700 washing machine, your utilization ratio will look worryingly high.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>Remember, though, that it's best to have <em>some</em> balance on your card when your statement is posted (assuming you pay it off in full each month), because as the chart shows, 0% utilization is about as bad as utilization > 31-40%:</p>

<p>I've heard these terms used somewhat interchangeably, but I have no idea what the differences are.</p>

<p><strong>What's the difference between a certified check, a cashier's check, a money order, and a bank draft?</strong></p>
","<p>Many of these products are similar in nature and often depend on the issuing bank.  </p>

<p><strong>Cashier's Check</strong>
Are checks signed and guaranteed by the bank.  This means the funds are coming from the bank instead of your account -- which usually means they immediately take the money from your account.  This is usually the most secure of the options and usually doesn't have many restrictions. </p>

<p><strong>Certified Check</strong>
Are checks signed by the customer, certified by the bank that you have enough funds and that your signature is genuine.  Usually, but not always - the bank will set aside the funds.  </p>

<p><strong>Bank Draft</strong>
Similar to a certified check but the bank will set aside the funds until the bank draft is used.  Generally used in transactions involving larger sums.</p>

<p><strong>Money order</strong>
It's a payment order similar to a certified check; however, it needs to be prepaid.  Also money orders may have maximum face values allowed.</p>

"Why do grocery stores in the U.S. offer cash back so eagerly?","87367","","<p>Most grocery stores and Walmarts I've been to ask you how much cash back you want as one of the steps you punch in after you swipe your credit card. This happens <em>after</em> you have swiped your card so they know if it will be a credit or debit transaction. You pay $X extra, and receive $X in cash from the cash register with no fee.</p>

<p>Since the store has to pay a fee (e.g. $0.10 + 2% of the transaction amount) to the credit card company, why do they bother to put that option in front of your face? From the perspective of a corporation, the attention millions of people give to that screen as they complete their purchase is extremely valuable. Why wouldn't they at least offer some product/service that would earn them money?</p>
","<p>The only card I've seen offer this on credit card purchases is Discover.  I think they have a special deal with the stores so that the cash-over amount is not included in the percentage-fee the merchant pays.  (The cash part shows up broken-out from the purchase amount on the statement--if this was purely something the store did on its own without some collaboration with Discover that would not happen).</p>

<p>The first few times I've seen the offer, I assumed it would be treated like a cash-advance (high APR, immediate interest with no grace period, etc.), but it is not.  It is treated like a purchase. You have no interest charge if you pay in full during the grace period, and no transaction fee.  Now I very rarely go to the ATM.</p>

<p>What is in it for Discover?  They have a higher balance to charge you interest on if you ever fail to pay in full before the grace period.  And Discover doesn't have any debit/pin option that I know of, so no concern of cannibalizing their other business.  And happier customers.</p>

<p>What is in it for the grocer?  Happier customers, and they need to have the armored car come around less often and spend less time counting drawers internally.</p>

<p>Focus on the purpose of the loan. Let the bank representative tell you what your options are. If you are told that you don't qualify, ask if there is something else that they could suggest. It might mean paying a higher rate of interest, or using some other asset or account as collateral for a secured loan. It is up to you whether you want to do that.

<p>Start by looking at the bank's website. See if there are any suggestions there, for document req's.

Then describe as best you can what type of loan you want, the purpose (to buy a house, boat, car, repay student loans at lower interest rate etc).</p>

<p>You'll need some combination of the following: </p>

<ul>
<li>Proof of ID which in the United States, (was in the question tag), would be a picture ID. </li>
<li>A driver's license or state ID card is good. If you don't have those, then a U.S. Passport or military ID. </li>

<li>Prior year's tax returns, other financial account statements (or account numbers if with the same bank) </li>
<li>Pay stubs or something that shows income. </li>

<p>A while ago, I ended up with $1000 transferred into my account, which in the description looked like a netbank transfer, not like a cheque, cash deposit etc, and which looked like it had already cleared and landed in my account. Usually when something is still working through the bank's system it displays as 'pending', but did not in this case.</p>

<p>I received a phone call from someone, saying that they had accidentally typed in the wrong account number, and wanting me to send them the same amount of money back via netbank.</p>

<p><strong>Question 1) Surely bank account numbers have a checksum</strong>, which make it relatively difficult for a typo to result in a payment going to the wrong person?</p>

<p><strong>Question 2) What are likely sources of them being able to find my phone number to call me?</strong> Obviously, the bank either being hacked, or giving it out in response to a query from this person (but surely the bank is unlikely to tell me my own mobile number if I claim to have forgotten it?). Presumably either my phone, or the phone of someone I have sent money to/received money from could be compromised. Has anyone heard of any instances of this happening?</p>

<p>I then went to my bank, explained the situation and said that I did want to refund the money through the officially sanctioned methodology. After the laughter died down, the bank told me to ask the person to fill out a form, then they would get me to fill out a form that would authorize undoing that exact payment.</p>

<p>I rang up the person to tell them this, and over the course of about a week received an increasingly elaborate story about how that wasn't working, they needed the money immediately, there was a fee to fill out that form and they couldn't afford to pay it etc.</p>

<p>After that, I never heard back from them again. I check my netbank for several weeks after, expecting the money to magically disappear, but it did not. This was probably a year ago, and I'm pretty vague with money so may not have noticed if it disappeared more recently.</p>

<p><strong>Question 3) How were they expecting to benefit?</strong> 
Were they hoping to get the transfer from me, and undo the transfer to me, to leave them $1k up? If so, how can an internet banking transfer be 'undone' once it has already shown as 'received'. Or was this to do with money laundering? The account they requested me to send money to was the same as the one that the money appeared to come from.</p>

<p><strong>Question 4) This was a scam, right?</strong></p>
","<p>This is a very trivial scam.</p>

<p>Flow is like this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Send money to Mr. X (you, in this case).</p></li>

<li><p>Mr. X initiates transfer back to Scammer.</p></li>
<li><p>Accept the transfer from Mr. X</p></li>
<li><p>Dispute the original transfer or otherwise cancel it through the netbank</p></li>
<li><p>Mr. X cannot dispute his transfer to the Scammer, since it was genuinely and intentionally initiated by Mr. X.</p></li>
<li><p>End up with twice the money, at the expense of Mr. X</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In other countries this is usually done with forged checks, but transfers can work just as well. As long as the transfer can be retroactively canceled or reversed - the scam works.</p>

<hr>

<p>You mentioned money laundering - this is definitely a possibility as well. They transfer dirty money to you from unidentified sources, and you send a ""gift"" to them with a clear paper trail.</p>

<p>When the audit comes - the only proof is that you actually sent them the gift, and no-one will believe your story. You'll have to explain why the Mr. Z who's now in jail sent you a $1K of his drug money.</p>

<li>Subtract any ""pre-tax deductions"" (med ins premiums, retirement, etc). This is the employee's ""pre-tax net pay"".</li>
<li>Divide the amount one W-4 allowance is worth annually (for 2012, that's $3800) by the number of pay periods in the tax year (e.g 26 for bi-weekly). Multiply this by the number of allowances claimed on the W-4 and subtract it from the pre-tax net pay to determine the ""pay subject to withholding"".</li>
<li><p>Taxes are computed ""piecewise""; dollar amounts up to A are taxed at X%, and then dollar amounts between A and B are taxed at Y%, so total tax for B dollars is A*X + (B-A)*Y. Here is the table of rates for income earned in 2012 on a daily basis by a person filing as Single:</p>

<pre><code>More Than   But Less Than   W/H Base   W/H Pct
   0.00        8.30           0.00      0%
   8.30       41.70           0.00     10%
  41.70      144.20           3.34     15%
 144.20      337.70          18.72     25%
 337.70      695.40          67.10     28%
 695.40     1501.90         167.26     33%
1501.90                     433.41     35%
</code></pre>

<p>To use this table, multiply all the dollar amounts by the number of business days in the pay period (so don't count more than 5 days per week even if you work 6 or 7). Find the range in which your pay subject to withholding falls, subtract the ""more than"" amount from the range, multiply the remainder by the ""W/H Pct"" for that line, and add that amount to the ""W/H Base"" amount (which is the cumulative amount of all lower tax brackets). This is the amount that will be withheld from your paycheck if you file Single or Married Filing Separately in the 2012 TY. If you file Married Filing Jointly, the amounts defining the tax brackets are slightly different (there's a pretty substantial ""marriage advantage"" right now; withholding for a married person in average wage-earning range is half or less than a person filing Single.).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In your particular example of $2500 biweekly (10 business days/pp), with no allowances and no pre-tax deductions:</p>

<pre><code>$2500 / 10 = $250 // you're in the 25% bracket
$144.20 * 10 = $1442.00 //amount taxed at lower rates incl. in W/H base
$18.72 * 10 = $187.20 //W/H base for $1442.00
$2500 - $1442.00 = $1058.00 //Amount subject to 25% tax
$1058.00 * .25 = $264.50 //Addtl tax for 25% bracket
$264.50 + 187.20 = $451.70 //Total Fed W/H
</code></pre>

<p>So, with zero allowances, your employer should be taking $451.70 out of your paycheck for federal withholding. Now, that doesn't include PA state taxes of 3.07% (on $2500 that's $76.75), plus other state and federal taxes like SS (4.2% on your gross income up to 106k), Medicare/Medicaid (1.45% on your entire gross income), and SUTA (.8% on the first $8000). But, you also don't get a refund on those when you fill out the 1040 (except if you claim deductions against state income tax, and in an exceptional case which requires you to have two jobs in one year, thus doubling up on SS and SUTA taxes beyond their wage bases).</p>

<p>If you claim 3 allowances on your federal taxes, all other things being equal, your taxable wages are reduced by $438.45, leaving you with taxable income of $2061.55. Still in the 25% bracket, but the wages subject to that level are only $619.55, for taxes in the 25% bracket of $154.89, plus the withholding base of $187.20 equals total federal w/h of $342.09 per paycheck, a savings of about $110pp. Those allowances do not count towards other federal taxes, and I do not know if PA state taxes figure these in.</p>

<p>It seems odd that you would owe that much in taxes with your withholding effectively maxed out, unless you have some other form of income that you're reporting such as investment gains, child support/alimony, etc. With nobody claiming you as a dependent and no dependents of your own, filing Single, and zero allowances on your W-4 resulting in the tax withholding above, a quick run of the 1040EZ form shows that the feds should owe YOU $1738.20. The absolute worst-case scenario of you being claimed as a dependent by someone else should still get you a refund of $800 if you had your employer withhold the max. The numbers should only have gotten better if you're married or have kids or other dependents, or have significant itemized deductions such as a home mortgage (on which the interest and any property taxes are deductible). If you itemize, remember that state income tax, if any, is also deductible.</p>

<p>I would consult a tax professional and have him double-check all your numbers. Unless there's something significant you haven't told us, you should not have owed the gov't at the end of the year.</p>

At the moment, this is an overwhelmingly large world record for a lottery jackpot!</p>

<p>I, like numerous others, have bought my very first lotto ticket but I have a question.  I live in one state (North Carolina) but I purchased the ticket in another (South Carolina.)

","<p>Although I am not a tax professional, and in this case you would be better off with a professional advice, my understanding (at least of Arizona, New York and California individual tax regulations that I've been dealing with) is that you only pay taxes in the state in which you're domiciled. </p>

<hr>

<p>Lottery winnings are payed by States/State-run corporations and as such sourced to the State that pays it. Buying a ticket in SC links you to the lottery run in that State, even if you live in another. You'll be claiming your winnings in SC, not in NC, and the winnings will be sourced to SC, not NC. As such SC will be taxing them. NC will be taxing them as well, since you're NC resident.</p>

"Why is there a limit of 6 ACH transfers out of savings accounts (per month)?","71836","","<p>I recently discovered this limit the hard way, after being charged a fee for each transfer over the limit. With online banking becoming so prevalent, this is a huge inconvenience as it prevents people from structuring their savings for the best internet rates. What is the reasoning behind this rule?</p>
","<p>The regulators (in the past, at least) and banks distinguish demand-deposit (checking) accounts from savings accounts. Checking accounts are without such limits, but savings accounts are subject to withdrawals-per-month limitations.  The overall effect of this is to slow the speed with which money flows through the savings account, thus essentially making the money remain on deposit for a longer time.  That's exactly why generally savings accounts pay more interest than checking accounts. </p>

"What typically happens to unvested stock during an acquisition?","71800","","<p>I work for a publicly traded company that was acquired by another publicly traded company. I also own shares of ""restricted stock units"" for my company. All of my shares are scheduled to vest far after the acquisition will be completed.</p>

<p>What typically happens to unvested stock options / restricted stock units during an acquisition?</p>

<p>I'm guessing/hoping that they'll be used to grant me to an equally valued amount of my new employer's stock, with the same vesting date. </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.mbbp.com/resources/business/double_trigger.html"">This article actually answers most of my question</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are a number of possible
  outcomes upon an acquisition.  They
  include but are not limited to: 1)
  full vesting automatically upon an
  acquisition, 2) partial vesting upon
  an acquisition with provision for
  additional vesting upon termination
  following an acquisition, 3) partial
  vesting upon an acquisition with no
  provision for additional vesting upon
  termination following an acquisition ,
  and 4) no vesting upon an acquisition
  with no provision for any acceleration
  post-acquisition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Regardless of that answer, I am still curious to hear from anyone else that has gone through this scenario and how it worked out for them, especially if it isn't one of the outcomes described in that article linked above.</p>

<p>According the publicly filed <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_8-K"">Form 8-K</a> document for the acquisition, I'll be getting a equitable amount of unvested stock with the same schedule. Great!</p>
","<p>This is a great question.  I've participated in a deal like that as an employee, and I also know of friends and family who have been involved during a buyout.  In short:  The updated part of your question is correct: <strong>There is no single typical treatment.</strong>  What happens to unvested restricted stock units (RSUs), unvested employee stock options, etc. varies from case to case.</p>

<p>Furthermore, what exactly will happen in your case ought to have been described in the grant documentation which you (hopefully) received when you were issued restricted stock in the first place.</p>

<p>Anyway, here are the two cases I've seen happen before:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Immediate vesting of all units</strong>.  Immediate vesting is often the case with RSUs or options that are granted to <em>executives or key employees.</em>  The grant documentation usually details the cases that will have immediate vesting.  One of the cases is usually a <strong>Change in/of Control (CIC or COC)</strong> provision, triggered in a buyout.  Other immediate vesting cases may be when the key employee is terminated <em>without</em> cause, or dies.  The terms vary, and are often negotiated by shrewd key employees.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conversion of the units to a new schedule.</strong>  If anything is more ""typical"" of <em>regular employee-level</em> grants, I think this one would be.  Generally, such RSU or option grants will be converted, at the deal price, to a new schedule with identical dates and vesting percentages, but a new number of units and dollar amount or strike price, usually so the end result would have been the same as before the deal.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I'm also curious if anybody else has been through a buyout, or knows anybody who has been through a buyout, and how they were treated.</p>

"What is the difference between pre-tax and post-tax paycheck deductions?","66079","","<p>I am getting insurance for about 4 months, the length of my contract with a company.  I am given the option of having the cost deducted from my paycheck pre-tax or post-tax.  What is the difference?  There is a link about Section 125 of the IRS code concerning Cafeteria Plans, but a lot of it is foreign to me and I can't find much about it online.</p>
","<p>Most people elect to have these deducted pre-tax because it reduces your taxable income. That mean that it is pulled from your income before social security, medicare, state and federal taxes are calculated. The reduction of pre-tax income can also make other deductions possible if it keeps your annual taxable income low enough, this really only impacts a few people, and would be considered a bonus benefit. Bottom line for most people pre-tax payments results in a higher take home pay.</p>

<p>The only reason I could find to make your health insurance premiums post-tax would be because that keeps your wages high when calculating monthly income for social security benefits. This would only impact people who were either near retirement, or were close to not making enough money in a quarter to potentially not get credit for the quarter.</p>

<p>One other distinction was that if the premiums were made pre-tax you can only change your insurance if you had a life event.  Post-tax premiums did allow you to make insurance changes without needing a life event. Again this would only impact a small number of people. </p>

"How to estimate a reasonable amount for a signing bonus?","65932","","<p>I'll be receiving the details for a job offer in the next few days and I was wondering if there are any guidelines for negotiating or evaluating possible signing bonus amounts. Obviously, if they don't include a signing bonus in the offer and they don't indicate that one  is negotiable, then it's probably just not in their budget.</p>

<p>But if it is negotiable, is there any way to determine a fair amount? I currently live in the same area where the job is located, so they won't have to pay any relocation fees for me. It's also somewhat of a niche style job (hybrid of scientific programming and financial analysis), so I expect employment options are competitive.</p>

<p>Are there guidelines for understanding how the signing bonus might relate to the other parameters of the offer (e.g. as percentage of salary or benefits, what if there is also a yearly performance bonus option, etc.)?</p>
","<p>So you've already considered relocation. Here are a few additional things to consider with respect to negotiating a signing bonus (if any):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Would you be leaving a position where you are eligible for an upcoming bonus, profit-share, or other special incentive payout, such as a stock option or RSU vesting date?  A signing bonus can help offset the opportunity cost of leaving a previous job when an incentive payout date is near.</p></li>
<li><p>At the new company, would you be required to wait some pre-defined period to be eligible to participate in the pension or retirement savings plan with employer basic or matching contributions?</p>

<p>If you were receiving ongoing employer contributions in your previous company's plan and would need to wait, say, six months before participating in the <em>new</em> company's plan, a signing bonus can offset lost employer contributions in the interim. Consider funding your own IRA in that time.</p></li>
<li><p>Would you be required to give up something else of value to you that your previous employer was providing, such as an expensive laptop, that is not expected to otherwise be replaced by the new company?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Whether they offer a signing bonus and how much you can expect to negotiate is based on a lot of factors and you'll need to ""play it by ear.""  Remember what <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?hl=&amp;q=bonus%20definition"">bonus</a> means: <em>""A payment or gift added to what is usual or expected, in particular.""</em></p>

<p>Remember also that a signing bonus is a one time thing.

"How does a public company issue new shares without diluting the value held by existing shareholders?","63730","","<p>When a public company issues new shares, the total number of shares traded in a secondary market goes up. Assuming there is no change in the fundamentals of the company and the profitability, I would expect that the share price of the existing shareholders would fall. However, this does not always happen in real life.</p>

<p>A quick Google search says that a company can only offer new shares if they have ""unissued capital"". My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>When can a company issue new shares?</li>
<li>How does it affect the existing shareholders?</li>
<li>What changes in the balance sheet after such an issue?</li>
</ol>
","<p>Unissued capital is only a token restriction. When a company is incorporated a maximum number of shares is specified in the legal documentation. Most companies will make this an extremely large number so they never face that limitation.  See <a href=""http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/_/dict.aspx?word=Unissued%20Capital%20Stock"">here</a>.</p>

<p>You wouldn't necessarily expect the stock price to change. The reason a company issues new stock is as a way to raise capital. Although new stock is issued, the cash raised by the sale becomes an Asset on the company's balance sheet.  There's a good worked example in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rights_issue"">this Wikipedia article</a>.</p>

<p>Following a rights issue the Liabilities of the company will increase to account for the increase in owner's equity, but the Assets will also increase by the same amount with the cash received.</p>

<p>Whether the stock price changes will depend upon what price the stock is issued at and on the market's opinions about the company's growth potential now it has new capital to invest.  If the new stock is issued at the same price as the current market price, there's no particular reason to expect the share price to change. Again Wikipedia has <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_dilution"">more detail</a>.</p>

<p>When new stock is issued it is usually offered to existing shareholders first, in proportion to their current holding.  If the shareholder decides to purchase the new stock in full then their position won't be diluted.  If they opt not to buy the new stock, they will now own a smaller percentage of the company as their stocks will make up a smaller part of the now larger number of shares.</p>

","<p>Technically, this doesn't seem like a scam, but I don't think the system is beneficial.  They use a lot of half-truths to convince you that their product is right for you.</p>

<p>Some of the arguments presented and my thoughts.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Don't buy term and invest the rest because you can't predict how much you'll earn from the ""rest""</strong>   Also <strong>Don't invest in a 401k because you can't predict how much you'll earn</strong> They are correct that you won't know exactly how much you'll have due to stock market, but that doesn't mean the stock market is a bad place to put your money. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Investing in a 401k is risky because of the harsh 401k withdrawal rules</strong>  Yes, 401ks have withdrawal rules (can't typically start before 59.5, must start by 70.5) but those rules don't hamper my investing style in any way.   </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Most Term Life Insurance policies don't pay out</strong>  They are correct again, but their conclusions are wrong. Yes, most people don't die while you have a term insurance policy which is why Term life insurance is relatively cheap.   But they aren't arguing you don't need insurance, just that you need their insurance which is ""better""</p></li>
<li><p><strong>You need the Guaranteed growth they offer</strong>  The chart used to illustrate their guaranteed growth includes non-guaranteed dividends.   They invest $10,000 per year for 36 years and end up with $1,000,000.   That's a 5% return!  I use 10% for my estimate of stock market performance, but let's say it's only 8%.   The same $10,000 per year results in over $2 Million dollars.  Using 10.5% (average return of the S&amp;P 500 over it's lifetime) the result is a staggering $3.7 MILLION.   So if I'm looking at $3.7M vs. $1M, <em>It costs me $2.7 Million dollars to give me the same coverage as my term life policy.</em> That's one expensive Term Life Insurance policy.</p></li>
<li><p>My personal favorite: <strong>Blindly following the advice of Wall Street and financial “gurus” such as Dave Ramsey and Suze Orman got you where you are. Are you happy with the state of your finances? Do you still believe their fairytale, “Buy Term (insurance) and Invest the Difference”?</strong>  Yes, I sure do believe that fairytale and I'm prospering quite well thank you. :)</p></li>

<p>What is the reason for this? </p>

<p>Is it just a historical accounting/industry convention? Or is there some reason why it happens this way?</p>
","<p>In other words, math. All the other answers are great, but I thought I might add something concrete to clarify slightly.</p>

<p>Consider a counterexample. Suppose I borrow $120000 at 1%/month interest (I know mortgages are usually priced with annual rates, but this will make the math simpler). Further suppose that I want to pay a fixed amount of principal each month, rather than a fixed payment. Let's say we want to pay off the loan in 10 years (120 months), so we have a fixed principal payment of $1000/month.</p>

<p>So what's the interest for month 1? One percent of $120K is $1200, so your total payment will be $2200. The second month, the interest will be on $119K, so your payment will be $2190. And so on, until the last month you will be paying $1010. So, the amount of interest you pay each month declines, as does your monthly payment.</p>

<p>But for most people, paying big payments at the beginning and smaller ones toward the end is completely backwards, since most of us earn more as we progress in our careers. Sixteen years after I took out a mortgage with a $1300/month payment, I find it fairly easy to pay, although it was a bit challenging to our cash flow initially.</p>

<p>The standard amortization requires a fixed payment each month, but the interest amount still has to decline as the principal declines. That means the amount of principal paid must increase as you go along.</p>

In your case gifting of money by son to father or viceversa is allowed without any limits and tax implication. However if you father were to invest this money in his name and make gains, the gains would be taxable. </p>

<p>However if the Money is being transfered with specific purpose such as to buy a property, etc make sure you have the Bank give your dad an certificate of Inward remittance. This is also advisable even otherwise, the Inwared Remittance certificate from Bank certifies that the credit entry in the account is because or funds comming into India and if the tax authorities were to question the large amount of credits, it would be proof that it is due to Inward remittance and not due to say a sale of property by your dad</p>

<p>This worked out well for the past year. However, I've recently had to record the <em>capital losses</em> I made on a short-term forex trade, but I can't remember how to record this.</p>

<p>In particular, do I use <em>two</em> separate accounts as such:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Income</strong> > <strong>Capital Gains</strong></li>
<li><strong>Expenses</strong> > <strong>Capital Losses</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Or just <em>one</em> <strong>Capital Gains (Losses)</strong> account where a <em>negative</em> balance indicates a capital <em>loss</em>?</p>

<p>if just a single account, would this account be under <strong>Equity</strong> or <strong>Assets</strong>?</p>
","<p>First, the balance sheet is where assets, liabilities, &amp; equity live.</p>

<p><strong>Balance Sheet Identity:</strong> Assets = Liabilities (+ Equity)</p>

<p>The income statement is where income and expenses live.</p>

<p><strong>General Income Statement Identity:</strong> Income = Revenue - Expenses</p>

<p>If you want to model yourself correctly (like a business), change your ""income"" account to ""revenue"".</p>

<p><strong>Recognized &amp; Realized</strong></p>

<p>If you haven't yet closed the position, your gain/loss is ""recognized"".  If you have closed the position, it's ""realized"".</p>

<p><strong>Recognized Capital Gains(Losses)</strong></p>

<p>Assuming no change in margin requirements:</p>

<ol>
<li>Increase/decrease the ""recognized capital gains"" account under assets by the increase/decrease in the value of the position</li>
<li>Increase/decrease equity by the increase/decrease in the value of the position</li>
</ol>

<p>Margin interest should increase margin liabilities thus decrease equity and can be booked as an expense on the income statement.</p>

<p>Margin requirements for shorts should not be booked under liabilities unless if you also book a contra-asset balancing out the equity.  Ask a new question for details on this.</p>

<p><strong>Realized Capital Gains(Losses)</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Credit off the position (the initial cost &amp; any accumulated recognized capital gains/losses) under assets</li>
<li>Debit off any liabilities (margin) due the position</li>
<li>Debit cash in the amount of the liquidated position</li>
<li>Increase/decrease equity by the gain/loss due to the position if they haven't been marked under ""recognized capital gains/losses""</li>
<li>Mark the sale of the position as ""Revenue""</li>
<li>Mark the buy of the position as ""Expenses""</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p><strong>Balance Sheet Identity Concepts</strong></p>

<p>One of the most fundamental things to remember when it comes to the balance sheet identity is that ""equity"" is derived.</p>

<p>If your assets increase/decrease while liabilities remain constant, your equity increases/decreases.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Double Entry Accounting</strong></p>

<p>The most fundamental concept of double entry accounting is that debits always equal credits.</p>

<p>Here's the beauty: if things don't add up, make a new debit/credit account to account for the imbalance.  This way, the imbalance is always accounted for and can help you chase it down later, the more specific the account label the better.</p>

They said they cannot change the primary account holder without refinancing.</p>

<p>Does this affect my ability to build good credit history with the loan?</p>
","<p>It sounds like your father got a loan and you are making the payments. </p>

<p>If your name and SSN are not on the loan then you are not getting credit for making the payments your father is.  So it will not affect your credit.  If you are on the loan as a secondary borrower it will affect your credit but not substantially on the positive but could affect it substantially on the negative side.</p>

<p>Since your father is named as the primary borrower you will probably need to talk with him about it first.  If this is a mistake the 2 of you will need to work together with the bank to get it corrected.  Since your father is currently listed first the bank is probably going to be unable(even if they are willing) to make a change to the loan now with out his explicit permission.</p>

<p>In addition if the loan is in your fathers name, if it is a vehicle loan, then the car is most likely in your fathers name as well.  Most states require that the primary signatory on a vehicle loan also be the primary owner on the title to the vehicle.  If your fathers name is the primary name on the title then you would have to retitle the car to refinance in your name.</p>

","<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lien"">Lien</a> is a record that can be put on your asset, meaning that any sale proceeds of the asset will go to a lien holder/lien holder must approve any transfer of ownership. The asset continues to belong to you though.</p>

That is clearly not feasible, and I don't have anyone to do this for me. </p>

<p>What options are available? Can I write a check to myself?</p>
","<p>You have a variety of options depending on the specifics of your situation.  I would recommend the first option if you live in an area served by TD Bank (you can also research similar banks who have both a US and Canadian presence such as RBC).</p>

<ol>
<li>The ATM: TD Bank doesn't charge ATM fees for use at a TD Bank/TD Canada Trust ATM (this is true for both TD Canada Trust customers in the US and TD Bank customers in Canada). This allows you to pull the money out of one account and deposit it into another with ease (no banking delays or high fees to contend with.</li>
<li>The Check: Write yourself a check. You can always take this approach, but it may be slow and incur fees at your bank in the US.</li>
<li>The Wire: You can take this route if your bank will allow it, but many won't like the idea of allowing you to initiate a wire without showing up in person (to minimize fraud).</li>
</ol>

<p>In order to give a more detailed answer you'd have to expose more information in the question regarding location.</p>

<p>Additional Notes: </p>

<ol>
<li>You can also always use a Canadian card in a US ATM. The fee you will be charged will be imposed by your financial institution (unless times have changed the US ATM will not charge you its ATM fee). So if you're doing it infrequently you may consider paying the ATM fee irrespective of your US bank situation.</li>
<li>You also can go to any major bank and request to do a withdrawal ""at the counter"" in case the amount you're withdrawing requires more than the ATM's dispense limit (but less than your daily withdrawal limit) or if you lack a PIN number.</li>

<p>For example, if I put 1 through 10 in that box, how much difference would that be for someone making $60,000 annually.</p>
","<p>A simplistic answer would be that it's a multiplier on how much money per paycheck to subtract from your tax withholding (taxes per paycheck), then at the end of the year you will have paid taxes on your income minus the amount of your withholding allowances.</p>

<p>If you get a decent (roughly 3% or more of your gross annual salary) refund you are letting the government withhold too much (and should increase your allowances), if you have to pay a decent amount of taxes at the end of the year then the amount withheld is not high enough (and should decrease your allowances). </p>

"Auto-pay credit card from checking account: Bad idea?","55651","","<p>Many credit card companies offer customers to make their payments via automatic direct debit from their checking accounts. Is this potentially a bad idea for cardholders? One thing that concerns me is that I could lose the right (or at least, the leverage) to have fraudulent charges reversed and merchant disputes resolved.</p>

<p>Are my concerns warranted? Are there any other reasons to not allow credit card companies to automatically debit your checking account?  </p>
","<p>I've been doing this for years, and haven't had a problem (yet).  Since I pay of the entire balance every month, this ensures that I never have to pay interest because I forgot to send in a payment.  As MoneyCone said, it does require discipline on your part to check your statement each month, prior to the autopay.</p>

<p>Remember, that even with autopay, you can override it for particular statements.  So if there is a fraudulent charge, you can dispute it with the credit card company, and manually pay the card whatever amount you want.  </p>

<p>The one thing I do worry about is the credit card making an error and withdrawing more than they should.  This is why I have the autopay tied to my local credit union account, which I only keep enough to pay the credit card bills and the occasional paper check, limiting the damage.

<p>Bank of America has set up a HSA for me to make contributions into.  But I do not understand this account's correlation with an actual health plan.</p>

<p>D</p>
","<p>See <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/q/8197/855"">this question</a> regarding the relationship between a HDHP (High Deductible Health Plan) and an HSA (Health Savings Account). In brief, to qualify for an HSA you must have a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-deductible_health_plan"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">HDHP</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>HDHPs are plans with a minimum deductible of $1,200 for self-only coverage and $2,400 for self-and-family coverage. The maximum amount out-of-pocket limit for HDHPs is $5,950 for self-only coverage and $11,900 for self-and-family coverage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As mentioned by Stainsor, your insurance can either come from your employer, or it can be an individually purchased plan. The HSA can be bundled as part of a package with the insurance, or it can be an account you set up separately.</p>

<p>Contributions you make to the HSA are tax deductible. You'll report the amount you contributed when you file your taxes the following year. E.g. in April 2012 you'll report (and deduct) the amount of HSA contributions you made for tax year 2011.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what kind of trouble you'll get into if you have an HSA without having a qualified HDHP.</p>

<hr>

<p>To answer the main part of your question:</p>

<p>Different HSAs may have slightly different features, but I've typically seen them provide the following ways to withdraw funds:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Via a debit card issued with the account. You can use the debit card to pay for things like drugs at the pharmacy, or at a doctors' office that requires payment at the time of service.</p></li>
<li><p>Via online bill pay. You can use this to pay bills from hospitals, doctors' offices, or other healthcare service providers that send you bills.</p></li>
<li><p>Via paper checks. For doctors' offices that require payment at time of service but don't accept plastic. (Or if you prefer not to use online bill pay.)</p></li>
<li><p>Via withdrawal at a teller window or ATM. You can use this to ""reimburse yourself"" for healthcare expenses that you paid out of pocket.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The issue of documenting legitimate expenses and/or qualifying for the account with an HDHP is between you and the IRS. The bank at which your HSA is kept doesn't really care whether you comply with the tax laws.</p>

<p>You can usually tell if a stock has low liquidity by the small size of the average daily volume, the lack of order depth and the large size of the gap between bids and offers.</p>

<p>So if a stock for example has last sale price of $0.50, has a highest bid price of $0.40 and a lowest offer price of $0.60, and an average daily volume of 10000 share, it is likely to be very illiquid.

"15 year mortgage vs 30 year paid off in 15","54234","","<p>I've found similar questions, but they all seem to focus on a preexisting 30 year mortgage and whether or not it makes sense to refinance to a 15.  My question is a bit different.  I have not yet bought a house but I am trying to decide which mortgage to go with.  As a result, I don't have to consider refinance fees and a change in interest rate. </p>

<p>The situation is that I can afford the payment on a 15 year mortgage and would prefer not to pay off a house for the next 30 years.  So I was going to go with a 15.  However, in looking at some mortgage calculators (which it is possible I am looking at incorrectly) it seems that there is no difference in getting a 30 year mortgage and just paying it off in 15 years.  The calculators seem to say that--assuming the same interest rate--you will pay the exact same interest over 15 years.</p>

<p>As a result, my thinking is, I can get the 30 and pay it like a 15.  If there really is no drawback then this gives me the ability to pay the normal 30 year payment if needed due to financial hardship (loss of employment etc.)</p>

<p>So my question is, am I missing something?  If not, why would anyone ever get a 15 year instead of just paying off a 30 year in 15 years?</p>

<p>In summary: <strong>Does it really cost the same amount of money overall to pay off a 15 year mortgage vs paying off a 30 year mortgage in 15 years?</strong></p>

<p>PS: Please don't suggest taking the 30 year and investing the extra money.  I know this is an option and the one many would suggest.  However, for the purposes of this question please only consider 15 year vs 30 year paid off in 15.</p>

"My credit card company is asking for my current income citing ""Federal Regulations""","53884","","<p>So I received an e-mail today from a bank from whom I have an existing credit card as follows:</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, the email is legit because it includes security information in the e-mail that checks out. Of course, I still am not following any links in that e-mail just in case.</p>

<p>Does anyone here know what the backstory is on this? Was there recent regulation passed where card issuers need to know your income level? </p>

<p>Or maybe I'm wrong and this is just a phishing attempt?</p>
","<p>I received exactly the same letter (in email form) from Discover Card about 9 months ago, so I immediately called them, thinking that someone was doing some <em>very</em> convincing phishing -- the email had zero suspicious headers, the mail relays looked right, the stylesheets looked exactly like Discover Card's, etc.</p>

<p>Once I got a knowledgeable rep on the phone, she said Discover Card did indeed send the email.  She explained that the sentence means ""federal regulations <strong>allow</strong> us to grant you a credit increase (without performing a credit check) based solely on your statement of your income"", and therefore they're happy to store your stated income within your account profile in case they ever want to adjust your credit line in the future.</p>

<p>Now, this of course seems ridiculous to me, because creditors have always had complete freedom to adjust your credit line up or down as much or as little as they want without doing credit pulls.  (I know this from first-hand experience when Citibank cut my credit line by 85% without doing a credit pull.)</p>

<p>I think what must have happened is that some federal law was passed (or maybe expired) last year such that now card issuers are <em>allowed</em> to ask/store/use their customers' income information, so they figure ""hey, let's try to get as many customers as possible to volunteer this information, first by sending a letter that kinda makes it sound like they have to tell us, and then by telling them it can possibly benefit them in the future"".</p>

<h1>UPDATE</h1>

<p>Three months after I posted this answer (i.e. during the holiday shopping season), there was an interesting new development in my case that I think might be relevant.  Out of the blue Discover sent me a letter saying I might qualify for a credit line increase.  All I had to do was go to a page on the Discover site and answer two questions: 1) my yearly income, 2) my monthly housing expense.</p>

<p>So I went to the page and filled in the same number for (1) that I gave to the phone rep many months earlier -- a number, it should be said, that Discover has no way of verifying.  When I was done, the site instantly reported that I was eligible for up to a 20% credit line increase.  I was taken to a page with a slider bar where I could select the exact amount of the increase that I wanted.  I picked the maximum (I'm not sure why anyone wouldn't), and it was instantly approved.  There was no accompanying change in terms, APR, anything.</p>

<p>Two points:</p>

<p>(a) I have only a ""good"" credit score (not nearly an ""excellent"" score), so I have not been offered a credit line increase by anyone in quite a long time.  (On the other hand, I have been a Discover cardmember for ~20 years and have never missed a payment or carried a balance with them.  Additionally, I rarely ""double"" my cashback with them; I usually just take the credit against my balance.)</p>

<p>(b) I have had my credit reports ""frozen"" for almost four years to help prevent identity theft, so Discover could not have pulled my credit before making this offer.  (Naturally they have their own internal data on me and can generate their own internal quasi-FICO scores.)</p>

<p>So ... the moral of the story would appear to be that by my responding to their initial inquiry a year ago and giving a number (which, again, they had no way of verifying) for my annual income, I was eventually given a substantial credit line increase (around the time of year when Discover probably thought I would make use of it) despite my merely average credit score.</p>

<p>YMMV!</p>

<p>However, I have had a devil of a time getting them to provide me any kind of taxpayer ID number. Now that I've already paid them for their services, I don't have a lot of leverage to go demanding information from them. It isn't so much that they refuse, they just don't respond to my inquiries for this information.</p>

<p>I'd hate to run afoul of the tax rules and be subject to fines.</p>

<p>So what can I do in this situation, is it acceptable to file the 1099-MISC with the Taxpayer ID box left blank?</p>

<p>Update:</p>

<p>I found this information on a site selling tax software (so I won't spam for them by providing the source here), but it seems to indicate sending a 1099 without a TIN is enough for the IRS to fine you. I'm not sure how to act in good faith here with an uncooperative maintenance person.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you fail to file a correct 1099 information return by the due date
  and you cannot show reasonable cause, you may be subject to a penalty.
  The penalty applies if you fail to file timely, you fail to include
  all information required to be shown on a 1099 return, or you include
  incorrect information on a return. The 1099 penalty also applies if
  you file on paper when you were required to file 1099s electronically,
  <strong>you report an incorrect TIN (Tax Identification Number)</strong> or <strong>fail to</strong> 
  <strong>report a TIN</strong>, or you fail to file paper 1099 forms that are machine
  readable. The amount of the 1099 deadline penalty is based on when you
  file the correct information return.</p>
</blockquote>
","<p>There's a <a href=""http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/International-Taxpayers/Filing-Forms-W-2-and-1042-S-Without-Payee-TIN%27s"">regulation</a> for that, however I suggest consulting with an experienced EA/CPA licensed in your State as to how to proceed. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is no federal law which prevents a withholding agent from
  legally making a payment to a payee for the sole reason that the payee
  does not have a TIN.  However, sections 6721, 6722, and 6723 of the
  Internal Revenue Code allow the IRS to impose penalties on withholding
  agents who fail to report payee TIN's on information returns and payee
  statements (Forms W-2, 1099, 1042-S, etc.) which report payments made
  to payees. </p>
  
  <p><em>However, Treasury Regulations found at 301.6724-1 contain
  ""reasonable cause"" criteria which a withholding agent can use to
  establish acceptable reasons for not providing a payee TIN on an
  information return or a payee statement, and thus avoid the penalties
  which the IRS might otherwise impose on the withholding agent for not
  providing payee TIN's on information returns and payee statements.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>My understanding is that you do send the form without the TIN, and document and keep all the communications where you requested the TIN from the payee. Next time, make sure to get the W9 <strong>before</strong> making the payment, so that you could have that leverage you don't have now. They're <strong>required</strong> to provide it to you.</p>

<p>Read the text carefully though, and as I said - better get a professional to guide you. There are several different situations described, and in some you need to file an affidavit of your efforts, in others you don't. See which one applies to you.</p>

"What Mutual Funds does Dave Ramsey Invest in?","52194","","<p>Heard Dave Ramsey speaking the other night on his growth mutual fund strategy and he mentioned  reading one of his fund's prospectus and said this fund had a <strong>78 year history</strong> and <strong>11.94% average return</strong> over those 78 years.</p>

<p>Tried some searches but not sure how to find this specific fund. Anyone know any tools/tips to find this fund or other like it?</p>
","<p>He was most likely talking about <a href=""http://www.americanfunds.com"">American Funds</a>' mutual fund called <a href=""https://www.americanfunds.com/funds/details.htm?fundGroupNumber=4&amp;fundClassNumber=0"">The Investment Company of America</a>. It lists January 1, 1934 as its inception date, which is just over 78 years ago. As shown at the link above, it lists its cumulative annualized returns as of December 31, 2011 to be 11.97% (not taking any loads into account). It does appear to be a relatively popular fund, with over 3.5 million shareholder accounts and over $50 billion in net assets.</p>

<p>The fund is targeted primarily at American large-cap equities, and is actively managed. Commensurate with that, its expenses are higher than index funds (the actual expense ratio and/or loads depend upon the share class that you choose; the above link shows information for class A shares, which carry a somewhat hefty front-end load); it's up to you to choose between a higher-cost, actively-managed fund (and hope that the managers are good at picking stocks) versus  a low-cost indexing approach promoted by companies like Vanguard. You'll find people on both sides of that fence. </p>

<p>However, as JoeTaxpayer already pointed out, the average return of the market over the same time period was very similar, or even better (I'm not sure exactly how the calculator he referenced arrived at the number; the S&amp;P 500 didn't exist in its current form until 1957), so it's not clear that the management of this fund has added value from a total return standpoint. Depending upon your risk appetite, however, it may be worth looking a bit deeper to compare the fund's volatility with that of the overall market; a similar return with lower volatility might be desirable.</p>

<p>What value does this code add if it's optional in the end?</p>
","<p><strong>As a general premise:</strong><br>
In most of the online transactions in case of dispute the benefit of doubt is given to the customer. IE if the customer refuses to pay and claims that its not his transaction, the card company reverses the charges and does not pay the merchant (or recovers if its already paid).  </p>

<p>There are many types of online vendors who use a variety of methods to ensure that they are not at loss. Some of these are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Ensuring entry of 3-4 digit CVV indicating that if someone used the card, he was in possession of it. However anyone at a POS while swiping the card can make a note of this and misuse the card.  </li>
<li>Additional address/ZIP code validation. This ensure slightly better protection that for a misuse, the card number, the CVV, the address need to be known.  </li>
<li>In spite of this online merchants Factoring in the probable loss due to fraud and marking up the price of the product to that extent.  </li>
<li>Certain merchants like say Netflix is not bothered about any validation as their service involves delivering a movie to the doorstep everyday and they would know the customer much better and can easily track down errant subscribers. Plus the cost of fees is for a month of service recovered in advance. This may hold good for one time occassioanal delivery by say Amazon as the cost of tracking and getting back the goods is high. Even if the subscriber makes away with a DVD on the first go, the loss to Netflix is just the cost of DVD copy <em>though the gain to thief may be the market price of such DVD</em>.</li>
<li>Similar is the case with say Norton or other virus service providers, they would simply deactivate the product code (if paid by card and later refused) when you go online and the purchase would be of no use.  </li>
<li>The online industry is also plagued with cases where the transactions are actually made by card owners, who after enjoying the services dispute the claim with the card providers.  </li>
<li>Certain countries like India have now mandated that all online card transactions be validated by additional password apart from card number and CVV. The password needs to be generated by contacting the merchant bank before online transactions are allowed. Of course there is still a debate if the merchant is outside India, why should he comply with the additional norm. If an card issued outside India is used in India, they may not have additional password issued by their card providers.</li>

What is the corresponding monthly rate and how do I compute that?  I'm assuming it's not as simple as 1%, and there is some compound component to this?</p>

","<p>I've spoken with a number of expatriates in Canada and Canadian bankers over the past few days.  Here's what I've been able to piece together.</p>

<h3>Wiring Money to Canada from Outside North America Involves Trial-and-Error</h3>

<p>This was surprising to me.  As I understand it, the only sure-fire way to wire transfer funds from an arbitrary bank to another arbitrary bank on a different continent <em>on the first try</em> 
is by using the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bank_Account_Number"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">IBAN number</a> of the destination account.  IBAN seems to be the only <em>account number</em> format that is anywhere close to a worldwide standard.  If the destination account does not have an IBAN number (like those in <a href=""http://www.td.com/to-our-customers/tdhelps/#psce%7Ccid=871%7Clid=1%7Ctid=001%7Cvid=a02271ad0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Canada</a> and <a href=""https://www.bankofamerica.com/deposits/manage/faq-wire-transfers.go"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">USA</a>), then you rely on a degree of wisdom on the part of the sending bank(er) to format your numbers (account/institution/transit/etc) in such a way that the transfer successfully reaches the destination account.</p>

<p>If any given sending bank has not sent funds to another given non-IBAN bank recently, then there is an element of uncertainty as to how the destination account's numbers have to be entered into the sending bank's system.  The <em>de facto</em> practice seems to be to develop the wisdom of what works and what doesn't by attempting to transfer small sums until they succeed.  Then the sending bank uses the exact same method to transfer the large sum as they used for the small sum that succeeded.</p>

<h3>Increasing Your Odds when Wire Transferring to Non-IBAN Accounts</h3>

<p>It seems like there are some things you can do pro-actively increase your odds that a wire transfer to a non-IBAN account will succeed.  Ultimately you want to provide four different pieces of information that are especially important for non-IBAN wire transfers:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_9362"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SWIFT Code</a></strong> - Even though the destination bank might not use IBAN numbers for its accounts, it probably has a SWIFT code that uniquely identifies the entire institution.  That way, if/when the transfer is made at least the wire transfer should end up in <em>your</em> institution and not some random other bank.  That way, hopefully, you can deal with your bank to sort out a failure not some other random bank who doesn't care about you.</li>
<li><strong>""Note: Canada/USA doesn't use IBAN""</strong> - From what I've heard, many bankers in places that use IBAN don't know that there are still places that don't use IBAN.  Often what happens is they enter the non-IBAN numbers into the IBAN field anyway and give up when they see an error.  Putting a notice clear and up-front gives the person entering the instructions a heads-up that they might need special help or authorizations for your wire transfer.</li>
<li><p><strong>All of your numbers in all applicable compositions</strong> - Wire transfer number formats are often actually multiple fundamental numbers that are concatenated, prefixed, and suffixed.  I suspect that some wire transfer senders actually need to enter the fundamental numbers separately or in different compositions.  Suppose the sending bank needs, for example, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_transit_number#ABA_Institution_Identifier"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">institution identifer</a>.  The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_transit_number#Routing_number_format"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ABA routing number</a> does contain, among other things, the institution identifier.  However, you should provide the institution number separately in your wire transfer instructions because the sending bank might need the institution number and will probably have no idea how to extract it from the ABA routing number. For Canada, I <em>think</em> the number you should provide are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Account Number without prefixes, suffixes, or concatenations</li>
<li>4-digit transit number</li>
<li>5-digit transit number</li>
<li>3-digit institution number</li>
<li>Canadian Payments Association Routing Number</li>
<li>Canadian Payments Association MICR Number</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The format used most commonly in the destination country</strong> - <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/a/45546/7251"">Dheer's answer</a> first put me onto this concept.  As far as I can tell in Canada, this format exists, is not (publicly) documented and might (probably) changes from receiving institution to institution.  I was able to get my Canadian banker to provide me with this number which turned out to be yet another concatenation of transit number, account number, and institution number with a <code>-</code> and <code>/</code> thrown in.  After asking around, getting this number right <em>does</em> seem to sometimes be the key to a successful wire transfer.  I've even heard rumors that some sending systems accept the number my banker provided me instead of IBAN numbers.  The story goes that the sending banker enters the undocumented Canadian number format into the actual IBAN field on their system.  The bank expected an immediate error (IBAN has a <em>very</em> specific format with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bank_Account_Number#Validating_the_IBAN"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">built-in validation</a>), but, to their surprise their system accepted the number and the transfer succeeded.</li>

"Is Weiss Research, Inc. a legitimate financial research company?","43435","","<p>I've seen two advertisements for so-called ""well known"" financial analysts and reporters purporting to have inside information on <em>grave</em> threats to the economy. I visited the websites advertised in the commercials just to see what all the hype was about. It turned out both websites were sales pitches for high priced newsletters containing investment advice. Both were products of the same company, Weiss Research, Inc.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.crisis12.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">first</a> sales pitch was given by Martin Weiss. He claimed to have correctly predicted several ups and downs in the economy months or years in advance of the actual event.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.freechinavideo4.com"" rel=""nofollow"">second</a> was by Larry Edelson, who appears to be the editor for one or more of the publications being advertised. He also claimed to have predicted many of the same events.</p>

<p>I know shameless self-promotion when I see it and I have no intention of buying a subscription to their publication but just because they toot their own horn doesn't mean they aren't telling the truth. So what I'm wondering is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Did they accurately predict the event's they claimed to?</li>
<li>Do the free rating <a href=""http://www.weissratings.com/sw/?m=s&amp;t=bank"" rel=""nofollow"">lists</a> they publish accurately reflect those companies financial health?</li>
<li>Do they appear to give sound financial advice?</li>
</ol>

<p>I tried to search for background information on Weiss and Edelson but everything I found pointed straight back to one of the numerous websites they control. Even the Wikipedia <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_D._Weiss"" rel=""nofollow"">article</a> was under review for deletion because there was evidence it had been written by someone associated with the company and didn't meet Wikipedia’s guidelines for accuracy and verifiability.</p>
","<ul>
<li>Regarding Martin Weiss, and Weiss Research</li>
</ul>

<p>This company was a reputable rating agency for many years. See <strong><a href=""http://www.weissratings.com/help/ratings-info.aspx#4"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Weiss Ratings methodology"">Weiss Research website, ratings section</a></strong> for a very different perspective on Martin Weiss's work than the websites with which he is now associated.</p>

<p>I checked both links provided, and agree with the questioner in every way: These appear to be highly questionable investment research websites. I use such strong terms based on the fact that the website actually uses the distasteful pop-up ploy,  <strong>""Are you SURE you want to leave this site?""</strong> Clearly, something changed between what <strong><a href=""http://www.weissratings.com/history.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Weiss Ratings Inc. history"">Weiss Ratings was in the past (per company history since 1971)</a></strong> and what Martin Weiss is doing now.</p>

<ul>
<li>Regarding Larry Edelson</li>
</ul>

<p>Larry Edelson seems to have been associated exclusively with questionable websites and high pressure investment advice since 2007. From 1996 through the present, he worked as either an employee or contractor of Weiss Research.</p>

<p>Let's answer each of your questions. </p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Did they accurately predict the events they claim?</strong> Weiss Ratings were accurate during the 1990's, and widely respected through at least 2003, see <strong><a href=""http://archive.gao.gov/t2pbat2/152669.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Archive GAO gao.gov PDF"">findings by the United States General Accounting Office in 1994</a></strong> PDF, that confirm that Weiss Ratings reports on insurance companies, maybe banks too, were more consistently accurate than those produced by the major credit rating agencies e.g.  S&amp;P, Moody's, Fitch. There was similar acclaim for Weiss ratings in the late 1990's, until about 2001.</li>
<li><strong>Do the free ratings lists they publish reflect this high level of accuracy?</strong> I don't think so, certainly not at the present time. In the past, their ratings were of course fee-based, not free. In fact, the Weiss Ratings website primarily offers  fee-based ratings reports now, just as it had been doing in the past. I am not familiar with these new, free investment reports, and they don't seem to be the same as the high-quality fee-based reports associated with Weiss in the past.</li>
<li><strong>Do they appear to give sound advice, now?</strong> Well, there were <strong><a href=""http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2009/34-60125.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""SEC 2009 PDF"">charges filed  against Martin Weiss and Larry Edelson by the U.S. SEC, settled in June 2009</a></strong> PDF, (settlement included return, formally known as ""disgorgement"" of $2.5 million in investor funds):</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>On June 22, 2006, the Commission instituted settled administrative
  proceedings against Weiss Research, Inc., Martin Weiss, and Lawrence
  Edelson (collectively, “Respondents”) for violations of the Investment
  Advisers Act of 1940 in connection with their operation of an
  unregistered investment adviser and the production and distribution of
  materially false and misleading marketing materials.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Full details about Weiss Ratings operations, including its history from 1996 through 2001, when it operated in compliance with securities laws, then from 2001 through 2005, which was when the SEC filed charges for regulatory violations, are available from the <strong><a href=""http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2006/ia-2525.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""SEC 2006 PDF"">June 2006 U.S. SEC court documents</a></strong> PDF.</p>

<p>Finally, this quantitative assessment, <strong><a href=""http://www.cxoadvisory.com/4305/individual-gurus/martin-weiss/"" rel=""nofollow"">""Safe With Martin Weiss?

<p>If my understanding is like the one shown in the example, then it means that I recover from this $5000 <strong>only a fraction</strong>, according to my tax bracket. </p>

<p>...or</p>

<h1>Example 2</h1>

<p>Say for example the scenario as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>I make $100,000 per year.</li>
<li>I pay $5000 of Property Taxes per Year</li>
<li>My final taxes (without taking into account my Property Taxes) say for example I owe $2000.</li>
</ol>

<p>....but as I already paid $5000, <strong>$3,000 should be returned to me</strong>.</p>

<p>Which one of the two is correct, Example 1 or Example 2?</p>
","<p>If your deductions are higher than the standard deduction, you will be able to subtract property taxes from <em>your income</em>. In your example, that means that taxes are computed based on $95,000. In 2011, the standard deduction varies between $5,800 (single filer) and $11,600 (married filing jointly).</p>

<p>What would you suggest are the best options for me to begin? I was considering getting a personal investor [a financial advisor] for perhaps a year or so, but I've heard that they really are not worth the money. I wanted to get the input of the great minds here. </p>
","<p>First off, I <em>highly</em> recommend the book <strong><a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0743264363"">Get a Financial Life</a></strong>.  The basics of personal finance and money management are pretty straightforward, and this book does a great job with it.

It isn't the most current book (pre real-estate boom), but the recommendations in the book are still sound.  (<strong>update 8/28/2012:</strong> New edition of the book came out.)</p>

<hr>

<p>Now, with that out of the way, there's really two kinds of ""investing"" to think about:</p>

<ol>
<li>Retirement (401k, IRA, SIMPLE, etc)</li>
<li>Non-Retirement (Brokerage account, investing in individual stocks, day trading, etc)</li>
</ol>

<p>For most individuals, it is best to take care of #1 first.  Most people shouldn't even think about #2 until they have fully funded their retirement accounts, established an emergency fund, and gotten their debt under control.</p>

<p>There are lots of financial incentives for retirement investing, both from your employer, and the government.  All the more reason to take care of #1 before #2!</p>

<p>Your employer probably offers some kind of 401k (or equivalent, like a 403b) with a company-provided match.  This is a potential 100% return on your investment after the vesting period.  No investment you make on your own will ever match that.  Additionally, there are tax advantages to contributing to the 401k.  (The money you contribute doesn't count as taxable income.)</p>

<p><strong>The best way to start investing is to learn about your employer's retirement plan, and contribute enough to fully utilize the employer matching.</strong></p>

<p>Beyond this, there are also Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) you can open to contribute money to on your own.  You should open one of these and start contributing, but only after you have fully utilized the employer matching with the 401k.  The IRA won't give you that 100% ROI that the 401k will.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that retirement investments are pretty much ""walled off"" from your day-to-day financial life.  Money that goes into a retirement account generally can't be touched until retirement age, unless you want to pay lots of taxes and penalties.  You generally don't want to put the money for your house down payment into a retirement account.</p>

<p><strong>One other thing to note:</strong>  Your 401K and your IRA is an account that you put money into.  Just because the money is sitting in the account doesn't necessarily mean it is invested.  You put the money into this account, and then you use this money for investments.  How you invest the retirement money is a topic unto itself.  <a href=""https://guidance.fidelity.com/getting-ready-to-retire/asset-allocation-importance"">Here is a good starting point.</a>  If you want to ask questions about retirement portfolios, it is probably worth posting a new question.</p>

<p>For a repayment mortgage, the lender calculates (on the counter-factual assumption that the interest rate will not change through the life of the mortgage) how much you need to pay each month to ensure that the principal will be paid down to zero after the agreed amortization period. So in the first month the principal is $80k, the interest is some fraction of that, I will call it X. You pay your monthly payment, Y, and Y-X is deducted from the principal.</p>

<p>In the second month the interest is a fraction not of $80k, but of $80k + X - Y. So in the second month the interest is slightly less than X, but your monthly payment is still Y. Thus in the second month the principal is reduced by slightly more than Y-X, and so on. Eventually in the final month of the mortgage you pay off 100% of the remaining principal.</p>

<p>An interest-only mortgage is simply one for which (by agreement with the lender) Y = X. That is, the monthly payments do not pay down the principal, <em>ever</em>. At the end of the mortgage you have to find the full amount loaned, because you still owe the bank the full amount.</p>

<p>If you end a repayment mortgage early then the lender uses this system of regular monthly interest charges and regular monthly payments to calculate your remaining principal. Then they'll add any administration charges or early repayment penalties on top of that calculated principal.</p>

<p>Whenever the interest rate changes (or the mortgage otherwise changes) your monthly payment is re-calculated to still hit your target repayment date, and the bank tells you your new payment.</p>

<p>As an issue of mathematics and in particular the effects of compound interest, it turns out that if the mortgage is amortized over a long period, you don't pay off <em>much</em> in the first 5 years. You do pay off something, but it's small enough that people will say, as an approximation, that in the early years you ""don't pay off the principal"". soakley shows some example figures, it depends on the interest rate and the repayment period.</p>

<p>So, <em>if</em> it were really true that you only pay off interest in the first 5 years (for example if the mortgage you choose to take is an interest-only mortgage), then at the end of 5 years your equity in the house would be the value of the house less the $80k that you still owe to the bank. Looking at it another way, your equity is your $20k up-front payment plus all of any increase in the value of the house (or minus all of any decrease, as the case may be). Assuming no change in the value of your house: $100k asset minus $80k debt equals $20k equity. </p>

<p>However if you have a repayment mortgage then you <em>will</em> in fact pay off a small amount in the first 5 years and so your equity will be more than $20k assuming no change in the value of the house.</p>

<p>Note also that there's no question of ""shares"" in the value of the house. People talk about the bank owning 80% of their house but that's not true (except in less common arrangements such as Islamic mortgages). You will own 100% of the house and owe the bank $80k (less whatever you've paid down). That's why all of the increase or decrease in the value of the house is yours.</p>

","<p>Credit card companies charge 2%-3% transaction fees. On typical retail transactions [buying clothes, groceries, electronic goods, etc] the margin is in excess of 10-30%. Hence the Merchants tend to absorb the cost of card from profit margin.</p>

<p>Some companies will lift the surcharge fee with a minimum transaction amount. For example, many fuel stations won't apply the surcharge if you buy at least 400 Rupees of fuel. There are also Card Tie-up where by Card Issuing Companies absorb this cost and hence no additional surcharge.</p>

"Consequences of buying/selling a large number of shares for a low volume stock?","41234","","<p>Out of curiosity, I've casually followed some penny stocks that trade for under a dollar a share, and find occasional swings up of 10-15%.  One naive interpretation of this fact is that if I bought $10,000 worth of these shares, and the stock went up 10%, and then I sold, I would make back $1,000 (minus my $8 trade fee).  </p>

<p>But the daily volume of the stock is only around 50,000 shares.  If we assume the stock trades at $0.20, my $10,000 would be a sudden purchase of that amount <strong>all at once</strong>.  I alone would be causing the trading of a whole day's worth of shares.  (If I could buy $100k worth of shares, it would be 10x the daily average, etc.)</p>

<p>My question is:  How should one think about what the effect would be for a sudden purchase that ""swamps"" the usual trading volume?  I have a feeling doing this would be a really dumb move, but I want to understand all the mechanics of why.</p>
","<p>The effect of making a single purchase, of size and timing described, would not cause market disequilibrium, it would only hurt you (and your P&amp;L). As @littleadv said, you would be unlikely to get your order filled. </p>

<ul>
<li>There wouldn't be anyone to take the other side of your trade, </li>
<li>There wouldn't be enough shares available at short notice, as a block.</li>
</ul>

<p>You asked about making a ""sudden"" purchase. Let's say you placed the order and were willing to accept a series of partial fills e.g. in 5,000 or 10,000 share increments at a time, over a period of hours. This would be a more moderate approach.</p>

<p>Even spread out over the span of a day, this remains unwise. </p>

<ul>
<li>You'll alert the few market participants in that stock that you have a large interest in buying. </li>
<li>You'll probably drive up the price of the stock, due to basic supply and demand for available shares. </li>
<li>You'll create the perception of a ""story"" or other change in fundamentals about the company, and expectations of share price appreciation in the near future. Even if it is true, you'll overpay, or possibly not be able to buy it at all, as existing shareholders won't want to sell if they think there is a chance for profit-taking. </li>
</ul>

<p>A better approach would be to buy small lots over the course of a week or month. But your transaction fees would increase.</p>

<p>Investors make money in <strong>pink sheets</strong> and <strong>penny stocks</strong> due to increases in share price of 100% (on the low end), with a relatively small number of shares. It isn't feasible to earn speculator profits by purchasing huge blocks (relative to number of shares outstanding) of stock priced &lt; $1.00 USD and profit from merely 25%  price increases on large volume.</p>

"Where do countries / national governments borrow money from?","40715","","<p>It seems that every country on Earth is in debt, but nowhere on the news do they ever mention to who. If countries are all in debt to each other then why not just cancel all the countries debt.</p>

<p>If it's one central place why don't all countries just refuse to pay it back and cancel the debt themselves, it would mean one place would have huge issues but we can just ignore that and just let them whither away, wouldn't it be better than having all these countries in debt?</p>

<p>Also why is it considered important (important enough to have cuts) to try and get rid of a countries debt? Surely it's not that bigger deal as if a country doesn't repay your hardly going to have someone repossess a country (especially when that country has it's own law and military)?</p>
","<p>""It's more complicated than that.""</p>

<p>Governments raise money in a number of ways.  First, they tax economic activity within their borders and for connected companies and individuals.  Then, some governments have actual revenues from state-owned enterprises (licences, patents, courts, business revenues, and so on).</p>

<p>Whatever shortage arises between state expenditure and this income is the <strong>deficit which is usually financed through debt</strong>.</p>

<p>Government usually issues a bond (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_government_bonds"">Wikipedia for a list of government bonds</a>) of various types, some with extremely lengthy maturation dates.  These bonds can be purchased both locally and by foreign investment funds.  The nature of who buys is important.</p>

<p>From the Wikipedia link you'll see that most government debt is very highly rated based on the ability of the state to simply raise taxes in order to fund redemption.  Pension funds are legally bound to only invest in highly-rated investment classes and the bulk of bonds may be purchased to support local pensioners.</p>

<p>A state that <strong>defaults on debt</strong> will first hit its own most vulnerable citizens.  In addition, the fall-out will result in a savage cut in ratings.  Countries like Argentina and Zimbabwe, which have both refused to repay their debts even to the IMF, are currently unable to raise investment at all.  This has a tremendous impact on local economic development.</p>

<p>So, default is out of the question without severe penalties.</p>

<p>The second part of your question is about <strong>paying down the debt</strong>.  As debts increase, more and more of the revenue that a country does earn is spent on servicing debt repayments.  Sometimes bonds are issued merely to refinance old debt.  A country that spends too much on refinancing debt is no different from an individual.  Less and less money is available to do other things.</p>

<p>In conclusion: governments can neither default nor binge-borrow unless they wish to severely limit economic opportunities for their citizens.</p>

"How to determine contractor hourly rate and employee salary equivalents?","39768","","<p>I am aware of the general differences between being an employee and being an independent contractor.  However, I am unable to easily compare the two when it comes to after-tax compensation.</p>

<p>Company A:  You're a contractor (1099).  You get paid $X/hour.  You genuinely act like a contractor and aren't secretly an employee.</p>

<p>Company B:  You're an employee (W2).  You also get paid $X/hour.  You genuinely act like an employee and aren't secretly a contractor.</p>

<p>If absolutely everything about the two companies are the same except your status as an employee/contractor, you'd be better off as an employee because you end up paying less taxes.  Your after-tax income will be higher.  But where's the dividing line?  <strong>Is there a simple formula that tells you the equivalent employee rate given a specific contractor rate?</strong>  I completely understand that this involves simplifications and won't be perfectly accurate.</p>
","<p>Here are a few points to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Taxes:</strong> As a consultant, you will be responsible for the employer portion of the Social Security and Medicare taxes, and you might have to pay for state unemployment insurance and state disability insurance, as well.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Office expenses:</strong> As a consultant, you may be required to buy your own laptop, pay for your own software licenses and buy other office-related supplies. For higher-end services, you may be setting up a complete office and even hire your own secretary and other support staff.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Benefits</strong>: As a consultant, you will be responsible for your own health insurance, retirement plan and other benefits that an employer would ordinarily provide.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Education</strong>: Your employer will likely pay for books and magazine subscriptions and send you to seminars, in order to keep your skills current; your client won't.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Liability</strong>: Consultants face certain liabilities that employees don't, and have to factor the cost of insuring against those risks into their rate. Let's say you're a software developer, and your faulty code causes a nuclear plant's reactor core to overheat and melt down. As an employee, you'll get fired. As a consultant, you will get sued. Even consultants in low-risk fields can easily shell out thousands of dollars per year for a basic general liability policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sales &amp; marketing:</strong> Don't forget that when your contract ends, you will have expenses associated with finding your next client, including the opportunity cost of not getting paid for your services during that time.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>All these factors contribute to your <strong>overhead</strong>, which you have to roll into your consulting rate. You should also add a <strong>margin of profit</strong> -- after all, as you're in business for yourself, you should be compensated for taking this entrepreneurial risk.  </p>

<p>If you're looking for a quick over-the-thumb rule, you can figure that your equivalent consulting rate should be about twice what you would be paid hourly as an employee. Assuming you work 2,000 hours a year, if you would receive a $100,000 salary, your hourly rate should be $100. Of course, this is only a very rough guideline. Ultimately, your rate will mostly be influenced by how established you are and how much your services are in demand.</p>

<p>When I asked them why they didn't send me a bill, and they answered that they forgot. I was shocked and irritated, because I don't have my receipts from 3 years ago anymore. </p>

<p>If they had told me that I owe them $10,000 from 3 years ago, I wouldn't have anything to fight back. </p>

<p>Can a doctor's office do that? Is there a statute of limitation (I'm just guessing) that forces them to notify me in a certain time frame?</p>
","<p>They have forever to collect a balance from you.  Furthermore they can add whatever penalties and fees they wish to increase that balance.  Worst of all, they don't have to remind you or send you bills or any other notification.  You owed it when you left the office.  (There very well could be local laws that require notifications, but that isn't really the issue here.)</p>

<p>That dentist has every right to deny you service until you settle the account.  Forever.</p>

<h2>The question you want to know is how long can they sue you for the debt.</h2>

<p>The statute of limitations on collecting that debt via court:
<a href=""http://www.bankrate.com/finance/savings/when-does-your-debt-expire.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bankrate.com/finance/savings/when-does-your-debt-expire.aspx</a></p>

<p>Which covers the rules on <strong>HOW LONG</strong> they have to collect the debt.  Owing the money is one thing, but the rules and tools that you creditor has to collect the debt are another.  You are probably worried about them suing you. But if you don't pay the debt (or settle in some way), that dentist can refuse to provide services to you, even if they write off the debt.</p>

<p>Ways you can be punished by your dentist for not paying the bill are:</p>

<h2>Credit Reporting:</h2>

<p>Depending on your jurisdiction and/or type of debt, they typically only report it on your credit (if they are reporting at all) for 7 years.  Even if you pay and settle the account, it will still be reported on your credit report for 7 years.  The difference is how it is reported.  They can report that ""user133466 is a super reliable person who always pays debts on time"".  They can say ""<em>user133466 is a flake who pays, but takes a while to pay</em>"".  Or they can say ""<em>user133466 is a bad person to provide services before collecting money, because user133466 don't pay bills</em>"".</p>

<p>Other people considering lending you money are going to read these opinions and decide accordingly if they want to deal with you or not.</p>

<p>And they can say that for 7 years.  The idea of credit reporting is that you settle up as soon as possible and get your credit report to reflect the truth.</p>

<h2>Getting a Judgement Against You to Collect:</h2>

<p>One popular way to collect a debt to is to sue you for it.  There, each state has a different time period on how long a creditor has to sue you for a debt.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.bankrate.com/finance/credit-cards/state-statutes-of-limitations-for-old-debts-1.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bankrate.com/finance/credit-cards/state-statutes-of-limitations-for-old-debts-1.aspx</a></p>

<p>If you pay part of the debt, that will often reset the clock on the statute of limitations, so be sure any partial or negotiated settlements state very clearly, in writing, that payment is considered payment in full on the debt.  Then you keep that record forever.</p>

<h2>They Can Hassle You For The Money:</h2>

<p>There are other interesting points in the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.  See <a href=""http://www.bankrate.com/finance/credit-cards/debt-collectors-calling-know-your-rights.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Debt collectors calling? Know your rights</a>. 
They can only contact you in certain ways, they must respond to you in certain ways, and they have limits on what they can say, who they can say it to, and when they can say it.  There are protections from mean or vicious bill collectors, but that doesn't sound like who you are dealing with.  I don't know that the FDCPA is a tool you need to use in this case.</p>

<h1>Bottom line - You Should Pay:</h1>

<p>You should negotiate your debt and try your best to settle up.  From your post, both parties dropped the ball, and both parties should give a little.  You should pay no or minor late fees, and the doctor should report your credit positively when you do so.  If you both made honest mistakes, they both parties should acknowledge that and be fair, and not defensive.</p>

<p><strong>This is not legal advice.</strong>  But you owe the debt, so you should settle up.  I don't think it is fair for you to not pay because they didn't mail you a paper.  However I also do not think it is fair for the doctor to run up fees and not remind you of the bill.</p>

<p>Finally, you didn't bring up insurance or many other details.  Those details can change the answer.</p>

"Making $100,000 USD per month, no idea what to do with it","36297","","<p>I have a few consulting jobs I do on the side, and this year I've had a lot of extra work, with several months in 2016 exceeding $100,000 USD in billing.  I do this work from my home with no advertising, marketing, or appreciable expenses.  This is the first time in my life with such a high income and I really have no idea what to do with it... I have the same small apartment and I still drive my 2008 Prius.</p>

<p>I've tried to read up on personal finance, but it's a dizzying and vast subject.  The advisors I've talked to all want to sell me their favorite instruments (and if I bite, they take a healthy commission).  So instead I have $500,000 in a Schwab brokerage account earning essentially nothing.  I am also doing zero tax-planning.</p>

<p>What should I do and with whom should I speak?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> To address some concerns enumerated in the comments/answers, let me add a few more facts: I'm 54, single, 2 kids (ages 11 and 13), $50k in their 529s, $1.8MM net worth ($1.1MM in pretax retirement accounts), have $1MM umbrella, estate planning done.  I max my SEP IRA each year, even though I'm not sure it's a smart idea (if taxes on ordinary income rise appreciably in the next 10 years, I'm screwed).  I've paid $40k per quarter in est taxes for 2016 thus far, giving me safe harbor based on last year's tax, so I should be fine.  And I pay my taxes honestly (and take virtually no deductions).  Thanks for all the advice guys!</p>

<p><strong>Second Edit:</strong> Also, virtually all of my investing education comes from www.whitecoatinvestor.com (a smart guy who addresses high-income folks while not peddling specific instruments).</p>
","<p>I know your ""pain"".  But don't worry about investing the money right now -- leave it uninvested in the short term.  You have <strong>other stuff</strong> you need to school up on.  Investment will come, and it's not that hard. </p>

<h2>Taxes and government</h2>

<p>In the short term, focus on taxes.  Do some ""mock"" run-throughs of your expected end-of-year taxes (use last year's forms if this year's aren't available yet). </p>

<p>Must you pay estimated tax periodically throughout the year?  The tax authorities charge hefty penalties for ""forgetting"" to do it or ""not knowing you have to"". </p>

<p>Keep an eye out for any other government gotchas.  </p>

<h2>Retirement</h2>

<p>Do not overlook this!  This is the best investment you could possibly make.  Max out your government sanctioned retirement funds - in the US we have employer plans like 401K or Keogh, and personal plans like the IRA.  This is fairly straightforward.  Avoid any ""products"" the financial advisors want to sell you, like annuities. </p>

<p>Also if you have the Roth type IRA, learn the difference between that and a normal one.  There are some tricks you can do if you expect to have an ""off"" year in the future. </p>

<h2>Don't forget charities</h2>

<p>Charitable giving is worth considering at high income levels.  Do not donate directly to charities.  Instead, use a Donor Advised Fund.  It is a charity of its own, which accepts your tax deductible donation, and holds it.  You take the tax deduction that year.  Then later, when the spirit moves, tell your DAF to donate to the charity of your choice.  </p>

<p>This eliminates most of the headaches associated with giving.  You don't get on the soft-hearted sucker lists, because you tell the DAF not to disclose your address, phone or email.  You don't need the charity's acknowledgement letter for your taxes, since your donation was actually to the DAF. It shuts down scams and non-charities, since the DAF confirms their nonprofit status and sends the check to their official address only. (This also bypasses those evil for-profit ""fundraising companies"".)</p>

<h2>How to invest: If you don't understand it, don't buy it.</h2>

<p>It's a lot simpler than they want you to know.  So-called ""financial advisors"" are actually salesmen working on commission.  They urge you to invest, because that's what they sell.  They sell financial products you can't understand because they are <strong>intentionally</strong> unduly complex, specifically to confuse you.  They are trying to psych you into believing all investments are too complex to understand, so you'll give up and <em>""just trust them""</em>. </p>

<p>Simple investments exist.  They actually perform <em>better</em> since they aren't burdened down with overhead and internal complexity.  Follow this rule: <strong>If you don't understand a financial product, don't buy it</strong>.  </p>

<p>But seriously, do commit and take the time to learn investment.  <em>You are the best friend your money will have - or its worst enemy.</em> </p>

<h2>Learning investment</h2>

<p>The only way to protect your money from inflation or financial salesmen is to understand investment yourself. You can have a <em>successful</em> understanding of how to invest from 1 or 2 books. (Certainly not everything; those ingenious salesmen keep making the financial world more complicated, but you don't need any of that junk.)  </p>

<p>For instance how do you allocate domestic stocks, foreign stocks, bonds, etc. in an IRA if you're under 40?  Well... how do smaller universities invest their endowments? <em>They all want the same thing you do.</em>  If you look into it, you'll find they all invest about the same.  And that's quite similar to the asset mix Suze Orman recommends for young people's IRAs.  See? Not that complicated.  Then take the time to learn <em>why</em>. It isn't stupid easy, but it is learnable.  </p>

<p>For someone in your tier of income, I recommend Suze Orman's books.  I know that some people don't like her, but that segues into a big problem you'll run into: </p>

<p>People have <strong>very strong</strong> feelings about money.  Intense, irrational emotions.  People get it from their parents or they get sucked into the ""trust trap"" I mentioned with so-called financial advisors.  They bet their whole savings on whatever they're doing, and their ego is <em>very</em> involved.  When they push you toward their salesman or his variable annuity, they want you to agree they invested well.  So you kinda have to keep your head low, <em>not</em> listen too much to friends/family, and do your research for yourself. </p>

<p>John Bogle's book on mutual funds is a must-read for picking mutual funds and allocating assets. </p>

<h2>Better advisors</h2>

<p>Certain financial advisors are OK.  They are ""fee only"" advisors.  They deal with all their customers on a fee-only basis, and are not connected to a company which sells financial products.  They will be happy for you to keep your money in your account at your discount brokerage, and do your own trading on asset types (not brands) they recommend.  They don't need your password. </p>

<p><em>Here's what not to do: A good friend strongly recommended his financial advisor.  In the interview, I said I wanted a fee-only advisor, and he agreed to charge me $2000 flat rate.  Later, I figured out he <strong>normally</strong> works on commissions, because he was selling me the exact same products he'd sell to a commission (free advice) customer, and they were terrible products of course.  I fired him fast.</em>  </p>

"How are long-term capital gains taxed if the gain pushes income into a new tax bracket?","36143","","<p>First, my understanding is that the long-term capital gains tax rate is 0% for those whose marginal rate on ordinary income is 10% or 15%, and (ignoring the highest 39.6% bracket) the rate is 15% for everyone else. (See <a href=""http://www.irs.gov/publications/p17/ch16.html"">this IRS publication</a> and <a href=""http://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/resource_center/expert_insight/schwab_investing_brief/tax_time/taxes_whats_new_now.html"">this article</a>.)</p>

<p>My interest is in what happens at the crucial break between the 15% and 25% bracket, which is $73,800 for married/joint returns in 2013 (and presumably will be higher in 2014, though I haven't been able to find out what that is or if it has even been set yet). Let's say a household has $64,000 in wage income, and sells stock for a $10,000 profit.</p>

<ol>
<li>Does their income for the purposes of establishing their tax bracket go to $74,000?</li>
<li>If so, is the entire $10,000 profit subject to the 15% long-term capital gains rate?</li>
<li>Is any part of the wage income subject to the higher marginal tax rate?</li>
</ol>

<p>Since the amount of income subject to the higher marginal rate is, well, marginal, part 3 seems somewhat less important than part 2. The real issue is whether the capital gains rate hits the entire profit, since, in that case, it seems the household should only sell enough stock to generate a $9000 profit, and sell the remainder in a future year.</p>
","<p>I had been pondering this recently myself too.  This question motivated me to do a little research.  It appears that what happens is that (take a deep breath) the capital gain does push you into the next tax bracket, but the capital gain is always interpreted as the ""last"" income you received, so that if your non-capital-gains income is less than the threshold, it will all be taxed in the lower bracket, and only your capital gain will be taxed in the higher bracket (but it will be taxed at the capital-gains rate of that higher bracket).</p>

<p><strong>In short, a capital gain can only push capital gains into higher capital-gains tax brackets; it cannot push ordinary income into higher ordinary-income tax brackets.</strong>  In addition, the amount of the capital gain is taxed in a marginal fashion, such that any portion of the gain that will ""fit"" into a lower bracket will be taxed at a lower level, with only the topmost portion of any gain being taxed at the top rate.</p>

<p><a href=""http://fairmark.com/general-taxation/your-tax-bracket/"">This site</a> is one claiming this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Will capital gain or dividend income push my other income into a higher tax bracket?</strong></p>
  
  <p>No, the tax rates apply first to your “ordinary income” (income from sources other than long-term capital gains or qualifying dividends) so these items that are taxed at special rates won’t push your other income into a higher tax bracket.</p>
  
  <p><strong>If my ordinary income puts me in the 15% tax bracket, can I receive an unlimited amount of long-term capital gain at the 0% rate?</strong></p>
  
  <p>No, the 0% rate applies only to the amount of long-term capital gain and dividend income needed to “fill up” the 15% tax bracket. For example, if your ordinary income is $4,000 below the figure that would put you in the 25% bracket and you have a $10,000 long-term capital gain, you’ll pay 0% on $4,000 of your capital gain and 15% on the rest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are several Bogleheads forum threads (<a href=""http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=106643"">here</a>, <a href=""http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=131854"">here</a>, <a href=""http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=121101"">here</a> and <a href=""http://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=1941655#p1941655"">here</a>) that also touch on the same issue.</p>

<p>The last of those links to <a href=""http://apps.irs.gov/app/vita/content/globalmedia/capital_gain_tax_worksheet_1040i.pdf"">the IRS capital gains worksheet</a>.  I traced through the logic and I believe it confirms this.  Here's how it works:</p>

<ol>
<li>On Line 7 you effectively enter your taxable income minus your capital gains --- that is, your taxable ordinary income.</li>
<li>On Line 8 you enter the threshold above which capital gain taxes apply (i.e., end of the 0% capital gains bracket).</li>
<li>On Line 9 you enter the smaller of your taxable income and the cutoff.</li>
<li>On Line 10 you enter the smaller of that result and your taxable ordinary income.  Since your taxable ordinary income is always less than or equal to your whole taxable income, this means you enter either the lesser of your taxable ordinary income and the cutoff.</li>
<li>The first of two crucial lines is Line 11, where you subtract Line 10 from Line 9, and as it says on the form ""this amount is taxed at 0%"".  If your taxable income was over the cutoff, but your taxable <em>ordinary</em> income was less than the cutoff, Line 9 will be the cutoff and Line 10 will be your taxable ordinary income.  Subtracting these will give you the amount of your capital gain that fits into the 0% bracket, and this amount will be taxed at 0%.  The rest of the capital gains (the portion that reaches into higher brackets) will be filtered through the rest of the worksheet, which performs the same logic for the other thresholds (i.e., marginally taxing your capital gains at the various rates).</li>
<li>Finally, the second crucial line is way down on Line 24, where you ""figure the tax on the amount in Line 7"" --- that is, you figure the tax on your taxable ordinary income using the ordinary-income brackets.  This means the tax on your ordinary income, using the ordinary tax brackets, is figured wholly separately from the capital gains.  Thus the capital gains income cannot change the tax bracket structure of your ordinary income.</li>
</ol>

Since the shares are now being traded among the public, if the value goes up or down, that is strictly a transaction between buyer and seller, none of whom are directly related to the company.</p>

","<p>Stock price is an indicator about the health of the company.  Increased profits (for example) will drive the stock price up; excessive debt (for example) will drive it down.</p>

<p>In an extreme case, if share prices plummet too far, the company can be pressured to reverse-split the shares, and (eventually) take the company private.  This recently happened to Playboy.</p>

These rules define certain employees as HCE (if their salary is significantly higher than that of the rest of the employees), and limit the ability of the HCE's to deposit money into 401k, based on the deposits made by the rest of the employees. Basically it means that while the overall maximum is indeed 17K, your personal (and other HCE's in your company) is lowered down because those who are not HCE's in the company don't deposit to 401k enough.</p>

The terms of the deal were 16k financed at 6% for 72 months. When I signed the paperwork however, I noticed that the amount financed changed to 18k something and the APR to 2.42%. When I asked the finance manager about it he said it added up to the same payment amount at the end, which it did. I didn't think too much about it because I confirmed that the amount paid at the end of the loan was the same. However, I failed to understand the long term implication this would have. V-e-r-y dumb mistake on my part. Yes, I was an idiot.</p>

<p>Now three years into the loan, I've moved to the North East, where I'm battling snowstorms and blizzards from hell. Due to the pains associated with driving to work in the snow, I'm trying to get an All Wheel Drive instead. Now seeing that the amount financed was more, the payoff amount on the car is of course more. Is there anything I can do with Toyota Financial (or anyone) about this? I'm way upside down on the loan right now; the car is worth 9k according to KBB and the payoff amount is 10,400.</p>

<p>My financial situation has improved a bit (from a FICO score of 593 in Aug 2012 to 701 right now) and I've gotten a few quotes for 0% APRs for new cars so I'm quite interested in pursuing those options if I can somehow settle this issue with my Camry's payments.</p>
","<p>There are a few things you should keep in mind when getting another vehicle:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>DON'T</strong> use dealership financing. Get an idea of the price range you're looking for, and go to your local bank or find a local credit union and get a pre-approval for a loan amount (that will also let you know what kind of interest rates you'll get). Your credit score is high enough that you shouldn't have any problems securing a decent APR.</p></li>
<li><p>Check your financing institution's rules on financing beyond the vehicle's value. The CU that refinanced my car noted that between 100% and 120% of the vehicle's value means an additional 2% APR for the life of the loan. Value between 120% and 130% incurred an additional 3% APR.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Your goal here is to have the total amount of the loan less than or equal to the value of the car through the sale / trade-in of your current vehicle, and paying off whatever's left out of pocket (either as a down-payment, or simply paying off the existing loan). </p>

<p>If you can't manage that, then you're looking at immediately being upside-down on the new vehicle, with a potential APR penalty.</p>

"Tax rebate on house loan for under construction property","33762","","<p>I have purchased a flat which is about to be completed by Dec 2014.</p>

<p>As per the law I can get tax benefits on principle up to 1L rs and interest 2.5L for first 2 years then 1.5L (if first loan, and loan amount &lt;=25L).</p>

<p>I am starting my EMIs from Apr 2014. So I only need to pay interest for current financial year.</p>

<p>Somebody just informed me that I can't avail tax benefits because the property is under construction. Once the construction is completed and I get possession, I can get tax benefit on amount paid after possession. </p>

<p>However I can get tax benefit on the interest I paid during under construction period in next 5 years. Every year I can get the benefit on 1/5 part of interest paid.</p>

<p>Is there any provision, I can get tax benefit on the interest I am paying in this financial year?</p>
","<p>The rebate is available from the financial year in which you have taken the possession of the property. All the interest paid in that financial year can be claimed. Any interest paid in the previous financial years has to be pro-rated in next 5 years at 20% [1/5th] each year. The rebate is for combined amount and there is no additional rebate for pro-rated amount.</p>

<p>For example, you have begun payments from say Oct 2013. You have taken possession of the house in Dec 2014.</p>

<p>You can claim rebate from the financial year April 2014 to March 2015.  </p>

<ul>
<li>The interest payments made from April 2014 to Dec 2014 and up to March 2015 can be included for rebate.  </li>
<li>Additionally the 20% of the interest payments of Oct 2013 to March 2014 can be claimed.  </li>
<li>Note the total limit is same. So if you are exceeding the exemption limit by utilizing the interest payments from April 2014 to March 2015, your 20% of pervious will go unclaimed.  </li>
<li>Same rule applies next year i.e. for financial year April 2015 to March 2016, you can additionally add 20% of Oct 2013 to March 2014 interest within the same limits.</li>
</ul>

<p>The principal paid if any in the period Oct 2013 to March 2014 cannot be claimed in any year.</p>

"My friend wants to put my name down for a house he's buying. What risks would I be taking?","33543","","<p>I appreciate you taking the time to read this as I'm looking for some guidance.</p>

<p>My good friend, who I have known since we were kids, asked me for a favor today. He originally intended to get a house with his now ex-girlfriend so that he could invest in one and later on, sell it.</p>

<p>The favor is the following: he wants to put my name down in buying the house with him since he cannot ""afford"" to do it alone. By this, he means the bank is willing to loan him 3x&ndash;4x the amount of his salary&mdash;but that's not enough. So, they would take my salary into account in order to arrive at the amount he needs to get the house. HE does not need any money from me, and he says he can remove my name after one month through something called Transitional Arrangement. (He compared it to a couple breaking up and the house being transferred entirely to one person in an agreement).</p>

<p>What he needs from me is for me to sign something, and 3 months' bank statements and 3 months' pay slips.</p>

<p>What are the risks, if any, could I be facing?</p>
","<p>That ""something"" you are signing means you are liable for the mortgage payments - yes, all of them - if he can't or won't pay at any point. </p>

<p>The limit on what the bank will lend him based on his salary is there for a reason - they don't expect him to be able to keep up repayments if they lend him more (or more precisely, there's a big risk that he won't). Don't forget that even if he swears up and down to you that he can afford them, interest rates can rise; this is a 25 or 30 year commitment you would be making. Interest rates are at a historic low and the only way from here is up; in my living memory rates have been 12% or even 15%. As a very rough rule of thumb, for every £100k borrowed, every additional 1% on the interest rates costs an additional £100 on your monthly payment. </p>

<p>Also, the ""Transitional Arrangement"" is not without its own fees and the bank won't let him simply take you off the mortgage unless they are convinced he can keep up the repayments on his own, which they clearly aren't.</p>

<p>Also thanks to @Kat for the additional good point that being on the hook for your friend's mortgage will prevent you from being able to get a mortgage yourself while the liability still exists, or at least severely limit your options. No matter how many times you protest ""but I'm not paying any money for that!"" - it won't help. </p>

<p>Another point: there are various schemes available to help first time buyers. By signing up for this, you would exclude yourself from any of those schemes in the future.</p>

","<p>If you are still paying off debt, then you should have about $1000 in savings and put all you can towards non-mortgage debt. If you don't have any debt besides your mortgage, then add up all of your monthly expenses including food, gas, utilities and keep 3-6 months in liquid savings. Whether you keep 3 or 6 months depends on how safe your income is. If you have a steady safe job, you might be safe with 3 months. But, if your employer is cutting back or you are in a commission based job or self employed - then lean more towards 6 months expenses. Congrats on your new home!</p>

"Why do governments borrow money instead of printing it?","33259","","<p>This question is raised in the movie <a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2550156453790090544#"">Money as Debt</a> (at time index 29:00).</p>

<p>The answer that immediately pops to my head is ""because printing money causes inflation"".</p>

<p><strong>However</strong>, according to this movie, money is created not only by printing it but rather more so by borrowing it (watch the movie for the details). In that case, borrowing money from banks also creates money - can't this this cause inflation as well? In this case, my question is the question the movie raises:</p>

<p>Why do governments borrow money instead of printing it? (When printing money, one doesn't need to pay interest).</p>

<p>(Note - I am asking an objective question, regardless of how objective the movie might or might not be)</p>
","<p>Governments borrowing money doesn't create new money. When banks ""borrow"" money (i.e. take deposits), it does effectively create money because the depositor expects to be able to get the money back at any time, but the bank assumes that most won't actually do this and lends out most of the money to other people. If everyone did actually ask for their money back at once, the illusion of the extra money created by this process would collapse, and the bank would go bust.</p>

<p>In contrast when governments borrow money, the loan isn't repayable on demand, it has a fixed maturity and the money is only repaid at the end of that period (plus interest at defined points during the period). So holders of government debt don't have money they can spend (they can turn it into money they can spend but only by finding someone else to buy it).</p>

<p>So government debt doesn't create inflation in itself. If they printed money, then they'd be devaluing the money of everyone who had saved or invested, whereas if they borrow money and use taxes to repay it, the burden falls more evenly across the economy and doesn't disproportionately penalise certain sets of people.</p>

"If stock price drops by the amount of dividend paid, what is the use of a dividend","33190","","<p>I have heard that some people buy stocks based on how much dividend they pay, because dividend is considered 'income'. But if I buy a stock for 100$ and it pays a $1 dividend, the stock would also drop by $1. So really, is there any benefit to the dividend? It seems the drop in price would cancel out the 'income', so what is the point in getting the dividend?</p>
","<p>There are many reasons for buying stock for dividends. </p>

<p>You are right in the sense that in theory a stock's price will go down in value by the amount of the dividend. As the amount of dividend was adding to the value of the company, but now has been paid out to shareholder, so now the company is worth less by the value of the dividend. However, in real life this may or may not happen. Sometimes the price will drop by less than the value of the dividend. Sometimes the price will drop by more than the dividend. And other times the price will go up even though the stock has gone ex-dividend.</p>

<p>We can say that if the price has dropped by exactly the amount of the dividend then there has been no change in the stockholders value, if the price has dropped by more than the value of the dividend then there has been a drop to the stockholder's value, and if the price has gone up or dropped by less than the value of the dividend then there has been a increase to the stockholder's value.</p>

<p><strong>Benefits of Buying Stocks with Good Dividends:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Buying up-trending stocks with regular dividend will provide good long term returns.</li>
<li>Some countries may have beneficial tax treatment for dividends compared to capital gains. In Australia investors get tax credits if they receive dividends from post tax profits.</li>
<li>Regular dividends can produce a regular source of income to retirees and help supplement the income of those still working.</li>
<li>Stocks with high dividends attract demand from investors thus potentially adding to the increase of the stock price over time.</li>
</ul>

<p>What you shouldn't do however, is buy stocks solely due to the dividend. Be aware that if a company starts reducing its dividends, it could be an early warning sign that the company may be heading into financial troubles. That is why holding a stock that is dropping in price purely for its dividend can be a very dangerous practice.</p>

<p>From the link in your question:<br>
Two Year: 0.478<br>
Three Year: 0.549<br>
Five Year: 0.842</p>

","<p>If your annual salary exceeded the maximum amount subject to Social Security tax for 2013 ($113,700 as per JoeTaxpayer's comment), then it is possible that the last paycheck is what put you over the limit. Thus, part of the salary on the last

<p>Is this normal or should I be disappointed?  I'm just starting to pay attention to this kind of thing, and I'm not sure how to judge the performance of my money manager.</p>
","<p>There is no typical return for an IRA. Understand that an IRA is not an investment type, it is just an account that gets special tax treatment by the Federal Government.</p>

<p>As for a 10.6% annualized return on your portfolio. That's not a bad return. At that rate you will double your investment (with compounding) every 7.2 years. Again, however, some context is needed. You can really only evaluate investment returns with your risk profile in mind. If you are invested in super safe investments like CDs, that is an absolutely incredible return. You compare it to several indexes, which is a good way to do it if you are investing in the types of investments tracked by those indexes. </p>

","<p>Can you reduce your interest rate? Talk to the lender. Maybe. Probably not. The rate reflects their perception of how much of a risk they're taking with the loan.</p>

<p>But if all you're borrowing is $2000, the savings that you might get out of any adjustment to the rate is not going to be all that significant. Sure, it would be nice, but it's not going to be enough to make or break your decision to buy this car. The big savings will be that you're paying interest on a much smaller loan, which means you can reduce your payments and/or pay it off more quickly.</p>

","<p>To give up your Social Security number, you would probably have to renounce your citizenship, since merely leaving the United States, becoming a permanent expatriate, etc. wouldn't be enough. </p>

<p>Paying Social Security taxes is <em>mandatory</em>, however. Even if your income exceeds the means testing limits, you are still required to pay Social security (FICA) taxes on the income that falls beneath it. </p>

<li>Self-employed workers with with yearly net earnings less than $400</li>
<li>Ministers, members of certain religious orders, and Christian Science practitioners may file <a href=""http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/f4361--2011.pdf"">IRS Form 4361</a> to exempt themselves from self-employment taxes, including FICA taxes.

<li>Election workers earning $1,000 or less a year.</li>
<li>Minor children with earnings from household work but for whom household work is not their principal occupation.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you aren't part of one of these groups <strong>or you joined them after already being enrolled in the Social Security system</strong> (i.e. paid FICA taxes, etc.), you don't have to take Social Security payments, but you are not exempt from FICA payroll taxes. This means that you can't simply become Amish and be exempt if you've already paid into the system.</p>

<p>Many of these answers were listed <a href=""http://askville.amazon.com/opt-out-Social-Security-system/AnswerViewer.do?requestId=1338366"">here</a>, but the only stated source is ""Wikipedia,"" so take it with a grain of salt. I've tried to provide other sources where I could. </p>

<h3>Ministers/religious officials</h3>

<p>I mentioned that the situation with ministers and/or religious officials is more complicated. Among other things, these officials need to <em>certify</em> that they are religiously opposed to receiving public insurance benefits and they have to file by a certain deadline soon after earning a certain amount as a minister. <a href=""http://enrichmentjournal.ag.org/200001/099_social_security.cfm"">Furthermore</a>, if you file this exemption and choose/chose to revoke it later on, e.g. by filing IRS Form 2031, during the short time windows when this is possible, you're no longer eligible to file for another exemption. Once you revoke your exemption, you won't get another one. </p>

<p>Also note that this opt-out <em>only applies to income earned as part of your ministry.</em> For non-ministerial income, you're still required to pay FICA taxes even if you follow the procedure(s) above.</p>

<h3>If you do opt-out</h3>

<p>Clearly, opting out of the Social Security isn't easy, or even feasible, for many people, but <em>if</em> you are outside the system, common sense dictates that you should insure yourself against risks that would usually be covered, at least in part, by Social Security. Dave Ramsey maintains a <a href=""http://www.daveramsey.com/article/should-ministers-opt-out-of-social-security/lifeandmoney_taxes/"">list of such investments</a> that he recommends ministers and religious officials who opt out of the Social Security system should purchase, but the rationale applies to anyone who isn't part of the system. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Term life insurance that covers 10x your annual income. Normally, your spouse or dependents will receive a <a href=""http://ssa-custhelp.ssa.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/202/~/lump-sum-death-payment"">Social Security death benefit</a> upon your death, but if you opt-out, your family doesn't have this option. Since the death benefit is a <em>pittance</em> ($255), however, you may want life insurance regardless of your participation in Social Security.</p></li>
<li><p>Long-term disability insurance. If you become disabled, you won't receive disability benefits, so you'll may want insurance to cover this risk.</p></li>
<li><p>Long-term care insurance. Similar to disability insurance, you may want additional income to cover you in case you require long-term care, and <a href=""http://www.medicaid.gov/Medicaid-CHIP-Program-Information/By-Topics/Long-Term-Services-and-Support/Long-Term-Services-and-Support.html"">Medicaid</a> isn't enough.</p></li>
<li><p>Other retirement savings. If you're not going to be paying money into Social Security, it makes sense to invest that money in some form of tax-advantaged or tax-sheltered retirement account to ensure that you still have <em>some</em> income in retirement. You won't be receiving Social Security checks, but you'll still need income.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Depending on your circumstances, it's may be a good idea to invest in some or all of these instruments anyway (especially tax-advantaged/tax-sheltered retirement accounts), because Social Security doesn't cover 100% of the risks you'll face, but that decision is highly specific to each person/family.</p>

"How do you determine ""excess cash"" for Enterprise Value calculations from a balance sheet?","32382","","<p>The formula for Enterprise Value that I often see is:</p>

<pre><code>EV = Total Debt + Market Cap - Cash
</code></pre>

<p>Often ""<em>Cash</em>"" is refined further as ""<em>Excess Cash</em>"" in this formula.  My question is how can I determine the amount of <em>excess</em> cash a company has from it's balance sheet?  </p>

<p>Is it as simple as subtracting <strong>Current Liabilities</strong> from <strong>Total Cash</strong>, since it would be advisable for a company to keep enough cash on hand to meet these types of liabilities, and therefore this portion would not be considered excess?</p>

<p>Then we'd have:</p>

<pre><code>Excess Cash = Cash &amp; Equivalents + Long-Term Investments - Current Liabilities
</code></pre>

<p>In Apple's case, this results in $49B of excess cash. I've also seen people use the general rule that any cash exceeding 20% of revenue is ""excess"".</p>

<p>What is the proper way to do this, in general, or pros/cons of different approaches? Am I missing something?</p>
","<p>​​​​​You're not missing anything. Excess cash is somewhat of a nebulous concept. To different people it means different things. The answer is that excess cash varies for each company depending on their business. For instance, some companies need very high amounts of working capital. A company may be increasing their inventories and therefore will require more cash on their balance sheet to fund growth. If a company always needs this extra cash, some investors prefer to leave that cash out of a valuation because the company cannot run profitably without it. Think about what happens to your calculation of Enterprise Value if you subtract excess cash as opposed to cash. Excess cash is always less than cash. Therefore by subtracting excess cash you increase EV. Since one common valuation metric is EV/EBITDA, a higher numerator will make the stock seem more expensive - that is the EV/EBITDA ratio will seem higher when using excess cash as opposed to cash. So using excess cash in your valuation methodology is basically a conservative concept. Depending on the business 20% of revenues seem way too high as a reserve for excess cash. 2% is a much better rule of thumb.</p>

The interest rate on the card is 24.something percent. </p>

<p>Due to personal financial reasons, I was not able to take advantage of low rate offers from Best Buy on stuff I bought on the card and ended up paying a whole bunch of money as interest. </p>

<li>I will have to pay annual maintenance fee even if I don't use this card.</li>
</ul>

<p>My question is, if I close this card which has a 4000 dollar credit limit on it, will it affect my credit score or credit history? Does it make sense for me to keep it open or just close it permanently? Will my total credit limit go down as a result as this card is not offered by a major credit card provider?</p>
","<p>There is no harm in keeping the card open, as long as there are no annual fees attached to the card and you have the discipline to not use it (for reasons I will explain in a moment). That being said, the affects of closing the card aren't as drastic as Chad alluded to either. I'll attempt to offer some solid clarification.</p>

<p>For starters, ""retail cards"" (store cards) are generally not that well regarded by the FICO scoring system as it prefers credit cards over retail cards. This type of credit you have only makes up 10% of your score, so not a significant portion (and you'll improve this by transitioning to a credit card if you already haven't).</p>

<p>The only immediate impact you can have as a result of closing this card is in an area called <code>utilization</code>, which accounts for <strong>30%</strong> of your score. The important question becomes: How much of your total credit is wrapped up in this $4K limit? Also, how much of a balance do you typically carry on your other cards in proportion to this total aggregated limit? The FICO scoring model prefers you to keep your <code>utilization</code> under 10%. If your utilization will still be under 10% after closing this account, your report will have no impact whatsoever in the immediate term.</p>

<p>The account will still report positive information on your report for 10 years, helping the <strong>35%</strong> payment history category, and will help your Average Age of Accounts, which is <strong>15%</strong> of your score, during the entire period. If you open a new card around the same time to replace this card it will age up while this card ages down causing a net neutral impact on your report.</p>

<p>So, basically, the answer to your question is ""it depends."" If your utilization number won't skyrocket your report won't be negatively impacted and you should close the account without a second thought. If your utilization will be impacted severely I would recommend you open a new account at a credit union, as MrCrister suggested, or request a Credit Line Increase on an existing account that you intend to keep.</p>

<p>I recommend you read the information from <a href=""http://www.myfico.com/CreditEducation/WhatsInYourScore.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Fair Issac regarding the FICO scoring system</a> that most lenders use. There are a lot of misconceptions about what impacts your score.</p>

","<p>Health &amp; Medical Insurance are same and cover the eventuality incase one gets ill and needs a major surgery/treatment/hospitalization.<br>
Life Insurance on the other hand covers the eventuality of death, where the sum assured goes to the Nominee. The money would be handy for the dependents incase of your untimely death.  </p>

<p>One needs to have both the covers. Medical and Life Insurance are covered under different sections for exemptions. For medical one can have upto INR 25,000 rebate for self and dependents. The Life Insurance is covered under 80c upto INR 1,00,000.</p>

<p>Do not buy a life insurance for tax saving, there are other instruments that would suffice your needs. Once typically needs to buy cover of 8 to 10 times you gross annual income. Term plans are the best plans and come very cheap.  </p>

<p>As your wife is not working, only a Medical insurance/policy would be sufficient.</p>

<p>Edit: Based on Yishai comment.<br>
One typically ignores Term policy for non-working spouse. However quite a few cases it may mean additional expenses, i.e. if children are small the need for additional house hold help, or the need of a vehicle / driver or may mean the surviving spouse need to cut-down on work time and reduced pay or any such needs have to be evaluated and based on it a term policy for spouse may well be advisable.</p>

"Daily interest calculation combined with monthly compounding: Why do banks do this, and how-to in Excel?","32006","","<p>I often see banks advertise (for accounts with fixed yearly interest, let's say 1.5%) &ndash; ""interested is calculated <em>daily</em>, and compounded <em>monthly</em>"".</p>

<p>I have 2 questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Why are they calculating it daily?? If the compounding period is monthly, what is the point of these daily calculations??! They could just calculate it once at the end of the month, right?</p></li>
<li><p>Can somebody provide me with an Excel formula to calculate future investment value for this type of scenario, where the interest calculation and compound periods differ? Perhaps playing with numbers in Excel will help me understand better.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Thank you.</p>
","<p>First, calculating interest on your bank account daily makes the most sense because your balance in a bank account typically <em>fluctuates</em> throughout the month: that is, you make deposits, and you make withdrawals.</p>

<p>If the bank calculated interest only at the end of the month, say, based on your balance <em>at that point in time</em>, then it might not be fair to either you or the bank. Depending on whether your end-of-month balance was higher than average, or lower than average, either you or the bank would come out ahead.  So, by calculating interest <strong>daily</strong> the bank is, in effect, arriving at an amount of interest on some form of average balance, which is more fair to both of you.</p>

<p>However, even though interest may be <em>calculated</em> daily, it is typically only <em>credited</em> to your account once per month.  Imagine the mess it would make on your statement if it were credited daily!</p>

<hr>

<p>Regarding calculating interest in Excel, have a look at the <a href=""http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/effect-HP005209074.aspx"">EFFECT() function</a>.  See also <a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/kb/213907"">How to calculate compound interest for an intra-year period in Excel</a>.  For instance, if the nominal annual interest rate were 5% and you wanted to know what the <em>effective</em> annual interest rate is with monthly compounding, you would write <code>=EFFECT(0.05,12)</code>, which would yield <code>0.051161898</code>, or ~5.116%.</p>

<p>A longer form in lieu of the Excel <code>EFFECT()</code> function is what you'll find explained at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card_interest#Calculation_of_interest_rates"">Wikipedia - Credit card interest - Calculation of interest rates</a>, i.e. the <code>EAR = (1 + APR/n)^n -1</code> formula.  Or, in Excel, <code>=POWER(1+0.05/12,12)-1</code> to match the example above.  Also yields <code>0.051161898</code>.</p>

<p>However, each of the methods above to compute the effective annual interest rate is only appropriate if you want to know the future value some years hence <strong>but without any inflows or outflows</strong>.  Once you have a situation where you are making deposits or withdrawals, you'll want to create a spreadsheet that calculates the daily interest and adds it to the ongoing balance on a monthly frequency.</p>

<p>To arrive at the actual amount of interest you would need to accrue for a single day, you would divide the original interest rate by 360 or 365.  (Bank rules on this may vary &ndash; I'm not exactly sure.)  So, the daily interest on a balance of, say, $1000 would be <code>=1000*0.05/365</code>, yielding <code>0.13698630</code> or 14 cents <em>if</em> rounded up to the nearest penny.  Of course, you need to know the rounding rules.  Perhaps rounding is done on each day's resulting interest (before summing), or on the sum of the month's resulting interest.  Plus, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_rounding#Round_half_to_even"">bankers can round different than you might expect.</a>  Again, I'm not exactly sure on this.</p>

<p>In constructing a spreadsheet to calculate interest this way, you should not be adding the daily interest to the ongoing balance <em>directly</em>, but rather accrue the interest in a separate spot off to the side somewhere <strong>until the end of the month</strong>.  At which point, sum up all of the daily interest earned and add it to the ongoing balance.  Consider:  If you were to credit the ongoing balance each day with that day's interest, then you would, in effect, be performing daily compounding instead.  By adding the interest to the ongoing balance only once per month, the compounding is in effect <em>monthly</em>, even though the interest is calculated on the daily balance.</p>

<p>Here's a link to <a href=""http://pragmaticmoney.ca/wp-content/uploads/answer-assets/money/10796/AccountWithDailyInterestMonthlyCompounding.xlsx"">a sample Excel spreadsheet (*.xlsx) I created to demonstrate the above</a>.</p>

"Credit Card Newbie - If I pay off my balance every month, what am I actually paying?","31822","","<p>So I have never owned a credit card in my life, and am trying to get ideas as to how they work.  Sorry if this is too simple a question...</p>

<p>Lets say I have a credit card, and in one month I charge $1000 to it.  At the end of the month, if I want to pay off the balance, am I paying $1000, or is there interest involved?  Does it differ depending on the card?</p>
","<p>In general, it works like this.  For ease of explanation, assume that the billing cycle is aligned on month boundaries, and have 10 days from the time you get the bill to when you have to pay.  These numbers will vary by credit card, but the concept is the same.</p>

<ol>
<li>Between Jan. 1 and Jan 31, you charge $1000</li>
<li>On Jan 31, the January billing cycle ends</li>
<li>You charge an additional $500 on Feb 5, and nothing more for the rest of the month</li>
<li>On Feb. 10, you receive a bill for January, for $1000, due on Feb. 20</li>
<li>On Feb. 20, you pay your bill of $1000.</li>
<li>On Feb. 28, the February billing cycle ends</li>
<li>On March 10, you receive a bill for $500, due on March 20.</li>
</ol>

<p>There would be no interest charged in this scenario.  As long as you pay the total amount of each bill by the due date, there is no interest charge.  Note that if you continuously charge on your card, it may never have a zero balance, even though you are paying your bill on time.</p>

","<h2>Cash Back</h2>

<p>When you go to a grocery store and want to purchase $12.34 you have several different ways of paying:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cash: give them $20 and get back $7.66</li>
<li>Check: write a check for $12.34 and get nothing back in change.</li>
<li>Check: write a check for $62.34 and get $50 <strong>cash back</strong> in change. Your bank will deduct 62.34 from your checking account.</li>
<li>Debit card : same options as a check. Though the deduction takes place much quicker.</li>
<li>Credit card: authorize a charge of $12.34</li>
<li>Credit card:  authorize a charge of $62.34 and get $50 <strong>cash back</strong> in change. Your credit card company will increase the amount you owe by $62.34.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you use the credit card in the example above, you will ultimately have to repay the $50 when the bill is due. The store / credit card company decides the maximum amount of cash you can get above the purchase amount. The store wants an amount that makes the customer happy, but one that doesn't drive their costs too high. The credit card wants it high enough to keep everybody happy, but not so much it becomes a risk for them. You could conceivably do more than one transaction a day.</p>

<h2>Cash Advance</h2>

<p>A <strong>cash advance</strong> is where you go to an ATM/Bank and get a much larger amount out. The maximum amount is typically 1/2 your credit limit. The actual amount is set by the bank/credit card company. These will have fees, and you going to be charged interest every day until you pay it back. Another way to get a cash advance is to use one of those <em>special</em> checks they send you in the mail. These are a cash advance against your account. </p>

<h2>Rewards programs</h2>

<p>In addition some credit cards have <strong>rewards programs</strong>. You can earn airline miles, free gifts, or cash back based on the amount of charges you put on the card each month . The ""points"" or dollars you earn in these programs come from the fees the vendors pay. When you spend money at the store, the credit card company collects a fee of ~2% on the transaction from the store. If you charge a lot each month, and the credit card company makes money even if you pay the balance each month. They fund these reward programs from the vendor fees. Charge $12.34 the credit card company charges a quarter, spend $62.24 they charge a dollar more.</p>

","<p>Why do you care if it's ""legal""? If you are concerned about the security implications and don't want to do it, then don't do it. If the company won't accept your deposits without it, then go to another investment company. There are hundreds of them out there. I have never, ever had someone ask for a scanned image of my credit card, and I've done business with at least half a dozen investment companies, so this is not a standard industry practice. You have at your disposal a protection far stronger than the ability to bring some sort of legal complaint: You can take your business elsewhere. Doing that doesn't require hiring a lawyer or going to court or anything. You just do it.</p>

<p>All that said, there are ways to avoid creating much additional security risk. I presume you've already given them your name, address, card number, and security code over the phone or through their website, so you've trusted them with this information, and if hackers or the NSA wanted to snoop on your private information, they could have done it then. Okay, a web page might have used https and thus been encrypted while an email is not. So three solutions: (a) If they provide an upload on an https page, use that and you have no more security risk than when you originally entered this information. (b) Put the scanned image into an encrypted file before emailing, like say an encrypted PDF, or encrypt the image file with some other software, and then send them the password in a separate email. (c) You can get fairly decent security by sending the front and back of the card in two separate emails sent at different times. Then a hacker would have to intercept both and be able to connect them to each other.</p>

<p>BTW I wouldn't really worry about the NSA intercepting such emails. I presume that if they want access to your credit card account, they have easier ways to accomplish that than figuring out this unusual system. Unless they have some specific reason to target you or this investment company, they're probably not searching for images of credit cards in emails.</p>

<hr>

<p>So far, I have described the ""official"" position.  However, reading between the lines, I think it is fair to say that in the current climate if you show up at an entry point with a suitcase full of a large amount of cash you would face considerable scrutiny, regardless of any supporting documentation you may present.</p>

<p>If you fail to present supporting documentation, then I think your cash would certainly be seized.  If you are a US resident, then you would be given the opportunity to obtain satisfactory documentation.  If you did present documentation, then I think your cash would be held for as long as it would take to verify the validity of the documentation.  Failure to present valid documentation would result in money laundering charges being brought against you and the matter would rest before the courts.</p>

<p>If you are not a US resident, then failing to produce supporting documentation would mean your cash being seized and entry into the US would almost certainly be denied.  You would then have to deal with the situation from outside of the US.  If you did produce supporting documentation, then again I suspect the cash would be held for as long as it takes to verify the validity of the documentation.  Whether or not you were allowed to enter the US would depend on what other documentation you possess. </p>

"What happens to options if a company is acquired / bought out?","29997","","<p>I have some out of the money options with pretty far off expiry dates (Jan 2013, for example).  What happens if the underlying company is acquired before then, while I'm still holding the options?  Do they instantly expire worthless?  What if if the acquisition price is greater than the strike price?</p>

<p>Let's take a concrete example.  Motorola was just acquired by Google, say for $38 per share (I don't know the exact number).  Say I had January 2013 call options with a $30 strike price.  Obviously right now while Motorola is still trading, I can sell or exercise them, but what about when Motorola stock no longer exists?  What if they had a $40 strike price?  Would I just be screwed?</p>

<p>Is there any way they could get converted into Google options (I assume not)?</p>
","<p>A lot may depend on the nature of a buyout, sometimes it's is for stock and cash, sometimes just stock, or in the case of this google deal, all cash.   Since that deal was used, we'll discuss what happens in a cash buyout.</p>

<p>If the stock price goes high enough before the buyout date to put you in the money, pull the trigger before the settlement date (in some cases, it might be pulled for you, see below).  Otherwise, once the buyout occurs you will either be done or may receive adjusted options in the stock of the company that did the buyout (not applicable in a cash buyout).</p>

<p>Typically the price will approach but not exceed the buyout price as the time gets close to the buyout date. If the buyout price is above your option strike price, then you have some hope of being in the money at some point before the buyout; just be sure to exercise in time.</p>

<p>You need to check the fine print on the option contract itself to see if it had some provision that determines what happens in the event of a buyout.  That will tell you what happens with your particular options.  </p>

<p>For example Joe Taxpayer just amended his answer to include the standard language from CBOE on it's options, which if I read it right means if you have options via them you need to check with your broker to see what if any special exercise settlement procedures are being imposed by CBOE in this case. </p>

<p>I'm graduating from school in 2 weeks, and have accepted a very good offer from a tech company (which I'm sure they could confirm to a bank). However, I don't happen to have any money right now, and understand that I need to put a few thousand down to move to another apartment -- which, optimally, I'd like to do before I start work. I asked at Bank of America, and they say they don't give personal loans (other than credit cards).</p>

","<p>Prosper is the best solution that comes to mind when you need a loan fast. One of the best parts of Prosper is that you can choose the terms of your loan.  Basically, you choose how much you need (from $2,000 to $25,000), the highest payments you're comfortable paying, and the term of your loan... the interest rate is calculated based on what you choose.  Investors bid on your loan listing (driving your interest rate down), and in as little as 24 hours up to a month, you'll have the funds wired to your account.</p>

"Multiple mortgage pre-approvals and effects on credit score","29681","","<p><strong>Background Info</strong>: My wife and I are looking to purchase our first home/condo. Given our combined gross annual income of ~$100k and lack of any actual debt, we're looking at properties in the $200-250k range. We currently have enough cash to put down ~10% and some semi-liquid stock assets (UTMA funds) to bring that up to 15% and have still some emergency cash. We wanted to save up 20% to avoid PMI and tax escrow and whatnot, but we ran the numbers and decided we'd be paying less than rent even with PMI and such included. Apparently we have to continue paying PMI for at least 2yrs (at least with our bank we would), but our plan is to pay down the principal faster and keep the PMI to a minimum.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> It seems that getting pre-approved (not just pre-qualified) for a mortgage <em>can</em> help make the decision between you and another non-pre-approved applicant and makes closing quicker and easier (with some of the leg work up-front), but I'm having troubles reconciling that with 1) getting multiple quotes for mortgage rates (which tend to change from time to time :p) and 2) limiting potential damage to your credit score from multiple hard-pulls.</p>

<p>My understanding is that (correct me if I'm wrong here) a pre-approval would require a hard-pull of <em>both of our credit reports</em> from <em>all three bureaus</em> as well as additional info like proof of income, tax returns, residence history, etc. (requirements here may depend on lender, but my understanding is that they [generally?] get <em>scores</em> from all three and use the middle one, and I don't know if it's possible, or even worth it, for them to get scores without the report - credit reports &amp; scores continues to be a confusing matter)</p>

<p>Any pulls within the same ~30 days count as one credit inquiry as far as credit-scoring is concerned, though, so it would seem to make sense to have all potential lenders pull it within that time period. I'm considering four lenders (two brokers recommended by friends, one broker recommended by Google maps reviews, and my standard local/national/international bank - too many?), which seems like a lot of work, but I assume much of that will be similar for all four (e.g., we don't have different tax returns, income stubs, etc. to give to different lenders - they'd all be the same).</p>

<p>I'll sum this up in two somewhat-competing questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Assuming you're within the 60-90 days that the pre-approval is valid for, will the lender do another hard-pull before approving the final loan? I assume not, but if that's not the case, it would seem to weaken the argument of getting multiple pre-approvals right away b/c you could have just had one done, find the best rate later, and close with the lender with the best rate (who would <em>then</em> do a final pull).</li>
<li>If you just get pre-approved from one lender, what's to say they'll have the best deal when you decide to close? (no matter which method you use to pick that one initial lender)</li>
</ol>

<p><strong><em>Alternatively</em></strong>, am I over-thinking this? I do tend to do that, and perhaps an initial pull and a later final-pull won't hurt that much anyways... After all, the final-puller would know what the initial pull was all about...</p>
","<p>The problem is not the credit score; it is the ""competing"" inquiries. Multiple inquiries will be considered as one if done withing a short time period (2 month, IIRC) and for the same kind of credit, because people do shop for rates, you're not the first one to do that. So don't worry about that.</p>

<p>What you should be worrying about is banks asking questions about these inquiries, which is an annoying (at least for me) technicality. You'll have to explain to each of the banks that you want a pre-approval from that you're going to take the mortgage from them, and not from anyone else. In writing, with your signature notarized. Which is OK because it's done (the signature and notarizing) at closing, but you'll have to ""convince"" them that they're the chosen ones to get approved.</p>

<p>Other than that it's pretty simple. I've done that (including the declaration that I'm not going to take any loans based on the other ""competing"" inquiries), and it worked fine when I took the original mortgage, and when I refinanced it later in a similar ""shopping"" fashion.</p>

<p>Do it closer to the actual bidding, because closing does take at least 3-4 weeks, and the rate lock is usually for 30-60 days, so not much time to shop if you take that road.</p>

"Are my parents ripping me off with this deal that doesn't allow me to build my equity in my home?","29409","","<p>When I bought my condo with cash for $155k, I paid $40k of my own money and my parents lent me $115k. Our agreement was that when I eventually sold the condo, my parents would get 75% of the gross sales proceeds.</p>

<p>I pay my parents $500 every month and I assumed I was building equity in the condo, but that doesn't seem the case since I can never own more than 25%. By the way, I am also responsible for all property taxes, insurance, and condo fees. Property taxes are about $3500 per year and condo fees are close to $4000 per year. I am also no allowed to sell the property without their consent.</p>

<p>I feel like this isn't actually a loan if I can never build more equity in the condo. Am I missing something? Are there similar deals like this or am I being ripped off my my parents? If so, what should I do? </p>

<p>Please help. I am starting to feel like I might have been betrayed by my family.</p>
","<p>It's a little unusual, but I don't think the financial terms are completely unreasonable on their face.</p>

<p>What you describe is similar to an <em>interest-only loan</em>, where you make payments that only cover the interest due each month, and the entire principal is due as a single ""balloon payment"" on a specified date (in this case, the date on which the condo is sold).  Your monthly payment of $500 on a principal of $115K is equivalent to an annual interest rate of 5.22%, which at least is not completely usurious.  With a traditional mortgage you might pay a rate as low as 3%, if you had sufficient income and excellent credit - but I don't know, from what you've said, whether that's the case.  Did you make the current arrangement because you were unable to get a loan from a bank?</p>

<p>The main difference here is that instead of the balloon payment being a fixed $115K, it's ""75% of the gross proceeds of the sale"".  If the condo eventually sells for $155K, that would be $116,250, so that's slightly advantageous to them (assuming that ""gross proceeds"" means ""before deducting commissions for either the buyers' or sellers' realtors or any other costs of the sale""), and thus slightly disadvantageous to you.  If the condo appreciates in value, that's more of a win for them and more of a relative loss for you.  But it's also possible that the value of the condo goes down, in which case this arrangement is better for you than a fixed balloon payment.  So this deal does prevent you from getting a larger share of any gains in the value of the property, but it also helps insulate you from any losses.  That's important to keep in mind.</p>

<p>There's also the issue of needing their consent to sell.  That's potentially problematic - usually in a joint ownership scheme, <em>either</em> owner has the right to demand to be bought out or to force a sale.  I guess it depends on whether you think your parents would be likely to consent under reasonable circumstances, or to insist on holding the property against your best interests.</p>

<p>It's true that you aren't building equity with this arrangement, and if you thought you were, you are mistaken or misled.  But let's compare it with other options.</p>

<p>If you would qualify for a traditional 30-year fixed mortgage at 3%, your monthly payment would be slightly lower ($484), and you would be building some equity because your payments would reduce the principal as well as paying the interest.  But a 30-year loan builds equity very slowly at first - after 7 years you'd have only about $20,000 in principal paid down.</p>

<p>If we assume that 5.2% represents the interest rate you'd otherwise pay based on your creditworthiness, then your monthly payment would be $631.  So compared to that, you have an extra $130 per month that you can save or invest in whatever you want - you're not forced to invest it in your house.</p>

<p>Note that in either case you'd still be paying the condo fees, property taxes, insurance, and maintenance yourself.  So we might as well eliminate those from consideration.  </p>

<hr>

<p>It might be a good idea to find out what other options you would have - perhaps try to get an interest rate quote on a traditional mortgage from a bank, based on your income and credit history.  Then you can decide what to do, taking into account:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>your financial situation; how much of a monthly payment could you afford?</p></li>
<li><p>your relationship with your parents; are they likely to be reasonable about renegotiating?  Do they in general tend to respect your wishes?  Would it harm your relationship if you tried to get out of the deal, and how important is that to you?</p></li>
<li><p>To what extent do you actually <em>want</em> to pay for equity in this property? Do you really believe it's a good investment, and have evidence to support that?  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Your options include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Try to renegotiate the terms of the loan from your parents</p></li>
<li><p>Try to ""refinance"" the loan, by getting a loan from a bank and paying off some agreed-upon amount of principal to your parents</p></li>
<li><p>Try to force the sale of the condo and move to another house, financing it some other way</p></li>
<li><p>Consult a lawyer as to whether your agreement with your parents is legally enforceable.  For instance, do they have a lien on the property?</p></li>

of devaluation of the Indian Rupee (INR).  NRE accounts are held in INR, and

<p>Last year I attempted the same procedure with our Federal tax refund check, also made out to my wife AND me.  The bank refused to cash the check and would not deposit the check, citing some rule that the US Government requires her to be present to endorse the check.  My response beyond, expletive deleted, was to point out that feds would not know whether she was present when the endorsement was made and that this makes no sense.</p>

<p>As it turns out I have another sole account at a different bank down the street from the first.  I took the check to it and successfully deposited the check to my account.</p>

<p>Was the first bank following statutory procedures or were they making up rules on the fly?  Was the second bank somehow remiss in depositing the check?</p>
","<p>U.S. Treasury checks are treated differently than other checks.  They are governed by <a href=""https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/31/part-240"" rel=""nofollow"">31 CFR Part 240</a>.  This regulation outlines the requirements for endorsing and presenting the check for payment, and the requirements are more strict than other checks.  In addition, the regulations give the government extra ability to refuse payment of the check if it is not endorsed properly that other check writers do not have.  As a result, banks are overcautious with treasury checks.</p>

<p>My credit union is normally very lenient when depositing checks into my wife and my joint account.  My wife or I can deposit checks made out to either of us, and as long as we are depositing the entire amount into our account (not cashing it), the checks don't even need to be endorsed.</p>

<p>However, when it comes to government checks (i.e. tax refund check), they insist that the check be signed by both my wife and I, even though we are simply depositing it into a joint account.  </p>

<p>Even with this policy, my credit union does not insist that we both be present at the teller window, just that we each sign the check.  Of course, as you and mhoran_psprep have pointed out, it would be ridiculous for them to insist we both be there, because we could deposit it by night deposit, by mail, or by any other after-hours method.</p>

<p>To answer your question, nowhere in the regulations that I could find does it insist that both parties be present to deposit the check.  However, the regulations do insist that the financial institution ensure that the check is not endorsed without each ""payee's consent or authorization.""</p>

<p>Perhaps your bank has been burned in the past by treasury checks getting returned.  When a bank is setting policy, they really can't expect their tellers to be familiar with all the details of every regulation.  They have to set policy that covers themselves legally and are easy to be followed by their employees.</p>

<p>The fact that it was not going into a joint account might have something to do with it.  But I agree with you that the policy does not make a whole lot of sense, and I don't think that the second bank was remiss.</p>

"Will a company's stock price be affected when warrants are issued, or exercised?","29005","","<p>A company has 500 million outstanding shares, and it issued 100 million warrants 10 years ago.</p>

<p>Assume that none of the warrants has been exercised yet. If tomorrow all the holders exercised their warrants, the company will have 600 million shares outstanding, and 0 warrants.</p>

<p>Will the company's share price be affected, since there is an increase in supply of 100 million new shares? Or would the share price have been adjusted/factored into consideration, 10 years ago when the warrants were issued?</p>
","<p>A company typically issues <em>warrants</em>* to investors &amp; institutions participating in a new share or bond issue. The warrant is a ""kicker"" to sweeten the deal by granting participants the right, but not the obligation, to acquire stock in the company at a set price, by a given date. (On the surface, warrants are similar to call options, but different in other respects. Perhaps another question.)</p>

<p>Usually, the warrants are priced <em>out of the money</em>, but with ample time before expiration to provide for the possibility that good company performance will raise the underlying share price above the exercise price, making the warrants worth exercising.</p>

<p>Since warrants tend to be issued as one part of a deal, the stock price <em>at the time of the deal</em> will primarily be affected by the principal financial instruments involved. The market will weigh the deal's pricing, reasons for fundraising, and likelihood for positive or negative outcomes. For instance:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If new shares are issued, are they at a steep discount to recent share prices? Shareholders don't like to see new shares issued at a discount, yet sometimes companies do it because they're desperate and nobody would pay a higher price. The market may drive down the share price.</p></li>
<li><p>If new shares are issued, are they at a price consistent with recent share prices? Maybe no impact. On the other hand, were the funds raised, say, to pay down high-interest debt, or fund an eagerly-anticipated expansion to fill unmet product demand?  If the reason for raising money has a good probability of growing earnings, the market may react positively, else yawn.</p></li>
<li><p>If new bonds are issued, are they at an interest rate higher than expected? Shareholders seeing higher interest costs ahead, or who interpret the higher rate as lower confidence from creditors may drive the share price down. Or, if shareholders had been worried a money-losing company might be unable to raise money <em>at all</em>, i.e. possible bankruptcy, then the shares could have initially been distressed, and success even at the high interest rate might be interpreted as a positive sign.</p></li>
<li><p>If new bonds are issued, are they at an interest rate lower than expected? As with the share issuance case, shareholders could react positively because the funds could, say, retire existing higher-interest debt, or fuel growth.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Those aside, let's consider just the warrants:</p>

<p>First, at the time of the deal, <strong>yes</strong>, the warrants can impact the share price:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If the exercise price is set too close to the current share price, shareholders might assign a <em>higher</em> probability that the warrants will ultimately be exercised, resulting in dilution of earnings per share.  Everything else being equal, high probability of future earnings dilution (and to what extent) is likely to have a negative impact on share price &mdash; <strong>however</strong>, you might not see any drop due to the warrants alone if the deal's primary instruments (above) gave the shares sufficient lift.</p></li>
<li><p>If the exercise price is sufficiently higher than the current share price, shareholders might assign a <em>lower</em> probability for exercise, i.e. less likely resulting in dilution.  Everything else being equal, this is unlikely to have much of an impact on the share price &mdash; <strong>however</strong>, you might still see a change in the share price due to the deal's primary instruments (above).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Next, at the time of exercise, <strong>yes</strong>, the warrants can also impact the share price. Recognize that the warrants are being exercised because the company share price has exceeded the warrant exercise price. These are two direct consequences of the exercise:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The <strong>actual</strong> increase in the number of shares outstanding, and the resulting dilution of earnings, are weighed more heavily by shareholders than the mere <strong>possibility</strong> of such. Yet, it's likely this will have been realized gradually by the market as the share price approached the warrant exercise price.</p></li>
<li><p>The new shares are being issued <strong>at a discount</strong> to the current market price. If the price paid by warrant holders to acquire shares is significantly below the company's net assets per share, then shareholders may also see this reduction in net assets per share as a reason to reprice the shares in the market.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There may be other reasons yet, but I hope I convinced that the market is <em>(a)</em> complex, and <em>(b)</em> constantly reassessing what a share might be worth based on a variety of changing factors &amp; expectations.  It's simplistic to assume the impact of a warrant issue will occur all up front, or all upon exercise.</p>

<hr>

<p>* n.b. I am referring to <em>""warrants""</em> in the traditional sense as used in the question, i.e. <strong><em>""financing</strong> warrants""</em>, typically issued by the company itself and, when exercised, resulting in issuance of new shares. Contrast with <a href=""http://www.asx.com.au/documents/products/understandingwarrants.pdf"" rel=""nofollow""><em>""Australian warrants""</em></a> which are issued by 3rd party institutional market participants, like a pure derivative product or exchange traded option &ndash; i.e. no new shares are created.

<p>Which should I read first: <em>Security Analysis</em> or <em>The Intelligent Investor</em>?</p>
","<p>I would recommend reading <em>Intelligent Investor</em> first. It was written slightly more recently (1949) than <em>Security Analysis</em> (1934). More important is that a <strong><a href=""http://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/mutual-funds/slideshows/10-books-investors-should-read/2"">recently revised edition</a>*</strong> of <em>Intelligent Investor</em> was published.

You can usually set the number to expire after a certain amount of time or to only accept charges from a specific vendor or up to a certain amount. This allows you to make credit card purchases without as much worry about fraud, because your original credit card information is still hidden from the merchant.</p>

<p>You may also hear about an alias on your credit <em>report</em>, which is simply a different name that's also listed on your credit report. This could occur because you changed your name (through marriage, for example), or someone a misspelling ended up on the report.</p>

  <p>Such price variations may seem odd, but they are not unique to Anaheim. On any given day, in any major U.S. city, a single brand of gasoline will sell for a wide range of prices even when the cost to make and deliver the fuel is the same.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> - A company can just give every share holder more shares, except for person X, whom they wish to dilute (without any investment going into the company). Is this situation possible/legal?</p>
","<p>The short answer, probably not much.  Unless you have a controlling interest in the company.  If at least 50%+1 of the shareholder votes are in favor of the dilution then it can be done.  There are some SEC rules that should protect against corporate looting and theft like what the Severin side is trying to make it appear as happened. However it would appear that Severin did something stupid.  He signed away all of his voting right to someone who would use them to make his rights basically worthless.  Had he kept his head in the game he could probably have saved himself.  But he didn't.</p>

<p>If your average startup started issuing lots of stock and devaluing existing shares significantly then I would expect it would be harder to find investors willing to watch as their investment dwindled.  But if you are issuing a limited amount stock to get leverage to grow bigger then it is worth it.  In the .com bubble there were quite a few companies that just issued stock to buy other companies.  Eventually most of these companies got delisted because they diluted them selves to much when they were overvalued.</p>

<p>Any company not just a startup can dilute its shares.  Many if not most major companies issue stock to raise capital.  This capital is then generally used to build the business further and increase the value of all shares.  Most of the time this dilution is very minor (&lt;.1%) and has little if any impact on the stock.  There are rules that have to be followed as listed companies are regulated by the SEC.  There are less regulations with private corporations.  It looks like the dilution was combined with the buyout of the Florida company which probably contributed to the legality of the dilution.    </p>

<p>With options they are generally issued at a set price.  This may be higher or lower than the reported sell price of the stock when the option is issued.  The idea is over time the stock will increase in value so that those people who hold on to their options can buy the stock for the price listed on the option.  I worked at an ISP start up in the 90's that made it pretty well.  I left before the options were issued but I had friends still there that were issued an option at $16 a share the value of the stock at the time of the issue of the option was about 12.  Well the company diluted the shares and used them to acquire more ISP's unfortunately this was about the time that DSL And cable internet took off so the dial up market tanked.  The value eventually fell to .10 they did a reverse split and when they did the called in all options.  The options did not have a positive cash value at any time.  Had RMI ever made it big then the options could have been worth millions.  There are some people from MS and Yahoo that were in early that made millions off of their options.  This became a popular way for startups to attract great talent paying peanuts.  They invested their time in the business hoping to strike gold.  A lot of IT people got burned so this is less popular among top talent as the primary compensation anymore.</p>

<p>Whats everyone's take on it? Can saving/investing 15% of your income starting age 25, likely make you a millionaire?</p>
","<h2>Can a middle class family do it with 15%?</h2>

<p>Yes, quite easily, in fact. </p>

<p>You left a lot of numbers out, so lets start with some assumptions. If you are at the median of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_middle_class#Academic_models"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>middle income</em></a> families in the US that might mean $70,000/year. 15% of that is an investment of $875 per month.</p>

<p>If you invest that amount monthly and assume a 6% return, then you will have a million dollars at approximately 57 years old. 6% is a very conservative number, and as Ben Miller points out, the S&amp;P 500 has historically returned closer to 11%. If you assumed an aggressive 9% return, and continued with that $875/month for 40 years until you turn 65, that becomes $4 million.</p>

<h2>Could a poor person do it?</h2>

<p>Start with a much more conservative $9/hr for $18,720 per year (40 hours * 52 weeks, no overtime). If that person saved 14% of his/her income or about $219 per month from 25 to 65 years old with the same 9%, they would still achieve $1 million for retirement.</p>

<p>Is it much harder for a poor person? Certainly, but hopefully these numbers illustrate that it is better to save and invest even a small amount if that's all that can be done.</p>

<h2>What does this imply for the software developers that pull in 6 figure salaries?</h2>

<p>High income earners have the most to gain if they save and the most to lose if they don't. Let's just assume an even $100,000/year salary and modest 401(k) match of 3%. Even married filing jointly a good portion of that salary is going to be taxed at the 25% rate. If single you'll be hitting the 28% income tax rate. </p>

<p>If you can max out the $18,000 (2017) contribution limit and get an additional $3,000 from an employer match (for a total monthly contribution of $1750) 40 years of contributions would become $8.2 million with the 9% rate of return. </p>

<p>If you withdrew that money at 4% per year you would have a residual income of $300k throughout your retirement.</p>

<p>But why is it worth more? If I exercise my American option early, I 
may make more money than waiting until expiration, but I also may make 
less. Mathematically, there's no advantage, since I'm equally likely 
to make as much money by waiting for expiration. </p>

<p>Mathematically speaking, is there ever a good reason to exercise an 
American option early? </p>

<p>I realize people don't always behave logically, but even the formulas 
that valuate options show that American options are worth more. </p>

movement."" </p></li>
</ul>

<p>REPLY: I don't think you really get N chances. Once you exercise the

the option today, and the underlying's price falls, you can't go back 
in time and exercise it yesterday. </p>

option? </li>
</ul>

<p>REPLY: Well, no. I'd simply buy a cheaper European option that expires 
right at the spike. Or, I'd buy a European option that expires later, 
and sell it when the spike occurs. American options don't give you 
precognition, so you're still guessing as to when to sell/exercise. </p>

<ul>
<li>@jdsweet: ""one of the more common reasons people exercise (as 
opposed to sell) an American option before expiration is if an 
unexpected dividend (larger than remaining time value of the option) 
was just announced that's going to be paid before the option contract 
expires"" </li>
</ul>

<p>REPLY: This makes sense. I'm actually trading FOREX options, so there 
is no dividend. In that scenario, are European and American options 
worth the same? </p>
","<p>According to the book of Hull, american and european calls on non-dividend paying stocks should have the same value. American puts, however, should be equals to, or more valuable than, european puts.</p>

<p>The reason for this is the time value of money. In a put, you get the option to sell a stock at a given strike price. If you exercise this option at t=0, you receive the strike price at t=0 and can invest it at the risk-free rate. Lets imagine the rf rate is 10% and the strike price is 10$. this means at t=1, you would get 11.0517$. If, on the other hand, you did'nt exercise the option early, at t=1 you would simply receive the strike price (10$). Basically, the strike price, which is your payoff for a put option, doesn't earn interest.</p>

<p>Another way to look at this is that an option is composed of two elements: The ""insurance"" element and the time value of the option. The insurance element is what you pay in order to have the option to buy a stock at a certain price. For put options, it is equals to the payout= max(K-S, 0) where K=Strike Price and St= Stock price. 
The time value of the option can be thought of as a risk-premium. It's difference between the value of the option and the insurance element.</p>

<p>If the benefits of exercising a put option early (i.e- earning the risk free rate on the proceeds) outweighs the time value of the put option, it should be exercised early.</p>

<p>Yet another way to look at this is by looking at the upper bounds of put options. For a european put, today's value of the option can never be worth more than the present value of the strike price discounted at the risk-free rate. If this rule isn't respected, there would be an arbitrage opportunity by simply investing at the risk-free rate. For an american put, since it can be exercised at any time, the maximum value it can take today is simply equals to the strike price. Therefore, since the PV of the strike price is smaller than the strike price, the american put can have a bigger value.</p>

<p>Bear in mind this is for a non-dividend paying stock. As previously mentioned, if a stock pays a dividend it might also be optimal to exercise just before these are paid.</p>

"Correct method of recording bank transfer in double-entry accounting","27179","","<p>What is the correct way to record the transfer of funds between 2 accounts of the same type (ie checking account to savings account)?  Since they are both debit accounts, wouldn't crediting one and debiting the other cause problems?</p>

<p>More detailed example.  My company is receiving funds as store credit, which is a liability account for us.  When a client chooses to use these funds as a ""budget"" for future work, we want to transfer the funds to a ""holding"" account, which we will then charge against as the services are delivered.  If we don't provide enough services to consume all of the funds on hold, then the remainder is returned to their ""store credit"" account.  This model was chosen so that the client can use their ""store credit"" account to place multiple orders without going negative.</p>

<p>It seems to me that both the ""store credit"" and the ""holding"" accounts are company Liability accounts.  What's the correct way to record this transfer as a journal entry?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>Your first and second paragraphs are two different cases.</p>

<p>Moving money between a checking account and a savings account will credit Cash and debit Cash, making a GL transaction unnecessary, unless the amounts in the two bank accounts are tracked as two separate GL accounts. You might have account 1001 (Cash-Checking) and account 1002 (Cash-Savings). In that case, a movement of money between these two accounts should be tracked by a transaction between the GL accounts; credit checking, debit savings. It won't affect your balance sheet, but depending on your definition of liquidity of assets  it might affect working capital on your statement of cash flows (if you consider the savings account ""illiquid"" then money moved to it is a decrease in working capital).</p>

<p>Basically, what you are creating with your ""store credit"" accounts for each client is an ""unearned revenue"" account. When clients pay you cash for work you haven't done yet, or you refund money for a return as ""store credit"" instead of cash, the credit is a liability account, balancing an increase in cash, inventory, or an expense (if you're giving credit for free, perhaps due to a mistake on your part, you would debit a ""Store Credit Expense"" account). This can be split out client-by-client in the GL if you wish, avoiding the need for a holding account.</p>

<p>The way you want to do it, you'd have a ""Client Holding"" account. It must be unique in the GL and to the client, and yes, it is a liability account. To transfer to holding, you simply debit Unearned Revenue and credit Client Holding, logging the transaction as ""transfer of client store credit"" or similar (moving liability to liability; balance sheet doesn't change). Then, as you sell goods or services to the client, you debit Accounts Receivable and credit Revenue, then to record the payment you credit AR and debit Client Holding (up to its current credit balance, after which the client pays you Cash and you debit that, or the client still owes you). To zero out a remaining balance on the Holding account, debit Client Holding and credit Unearned Revenue.</p>

<p>I don't think the Holding account, the way you want to use it, is a good idea. If you want to track each customer's store credit balance with a GL account, then create specialized Unearned Revenue accounts for each client who gets a store credit, named for the client and containing their balance (zero or otherwise). If you don't care about it at the GL level, then pool it in one Unearned Revenue account (have one Store Credit account if you must), and track individual amounts off the books.</p>

I have enough cash to buy the condo without a loan, but then won't have enough cash to make 20% downpayment on a house. So I feel kind of stuck between these 2 options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Take loan. can't buy a house because of the owner occupancy
affidavit</li>
<li>Don't take loan. But now have no cash to make downpayment for a year</li>
</ol>

<p>What can I do (if anything) so that I am able to buy a house in less than a year and rent out this condo? This is in state of Washington (WA) in USA if it helps.</p>
","<p>Danger. The affidavit is a legal document.</p>

<p>Understand the risk of getting caught. If you are planning on using the condo to generate income the chances that you default on the loan are higher than an owner occupied property. That is why they demand more down payment (20%+) and charge a higher rate. </p>

<p>The document isn't about making sure you spend 183+ nights a year in the property, it is making sure that it isn't a business, and you aren't letting a 3rd party live in the property. </p>

<p>If you within the first year tell the mortgage company to send the bill to a new address, or you change how the property is insured, they will suspect that it is now a rental property. </p>

<p>What can they do? Undo the loan; ask for penalty fee; limit your ability to get a mortgage in the future; or a percentage of the profits How likely is it? The exact penalty will be in the packet of documents you receive. It will depend on which government agency is involved in the loan, and the lenders plan to sell it on the secondary market. </p>

<p>It can also depend on the program involved in the sale of the property. HUD and sister agencies lock out investors  during the initial selling period, They don't want somebody to represent themselves as homeowner, but is actually an investor.</p>

<p>Note: some local governments are interested not just in non-investors but in properties being occupied. Therefore they may offer tax discounts to residents living in their homes. Then they will be looking at the number of nights that you occupy the house in a year. If they detect that you aren't really a resident living in the house, that has tax penalties.</p>

<p><strong>Suggestion</strong>:</p>

<p>If you don't want to wait a year buy the condo and let the loan officer know what your plan is. You will have to meet the down payment and interest rate requirements for an investment property. Your question implies that you will have enough money to pay the required 20% down payment.
Then when you are ready buy the bigger house and move in.</p>

<p>If you try and buy the condo with a non-investment loan you will have to wait a year. If you try and pay cash now, and then get a home equity loan later you will have to admit it is a rental. And still have to meet the investor requirements. </p>

"How does retroactive COBRA coverage work?","27002","","<p>I'm voluntarily leaving my job at the end of this month for a new position in a couple of weeks. At my new job, I have health care coverage effective my first day of work. My current coverage terminates on my last day of employment. This leaves a small gap in coverage.</p>

<p>One option is to continue my current health plan using COBRA for that small period of time. My employer's information on COBRA indicates that I will be notified by mail of my eligibility within 14 days of the qualifying event (i.e. job termination), and that I have up to 60 days to sign up for coverage. If I sign up, I will be covered retroactively to the day of the qualifying event.</p>

<p>It seems, then, that it makes sense to slow-roll the process; if my family has any pressing health care needs in that time period, I can then sign up for COBRA, and if not, then I will just pick up the new plan when I start my new job and save the relatively large COBRA premium. It seems that there could be gotchas with this approach, though. Am I missing anything obvious here? One concern that a friend brought up was that any existing health conditions that my family has could be treated as pre-existing conditions in the event that there was a gap in coverage. I've not had a chance to research that to verify.</p>
","<p>First, you are correct about having the 60 days to enroll.  Specifically, 60 days from the <em>later</em> of the date you are notified or the date you are to lose coverage:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you become entitled to elect COBRA continuation coverage, you 
  must be given an election period of at least 60 days (starting on the 
  later of the date you are furnished the election notice or the date you 
  would lose coverage) to choose whether or not to elect continuation 
  coverage. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><sup>From <a href=""http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/pdf/cobraemployee.pdf"">http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/pdf/cobraemployee.pdf</a></sup></p>

<p>Second, here is some information about the laws for pre-existing condition exclusions:</p>

<ul>
<li>The condition must have been diagnosed/treated for/etc. within the 6 months before your enrollment in the new plan. (In other words, old things that come back up do not apply.)</li>
<li>The exclusion may not be longer than 12 months (18 months for a late enrollee).</li>
<li>Cannot be applied to pregnancy</li>
<li>Must be reduced (from 12 months) by the duration of <strong><a href=""http://www.dol.gov/elaws/ebsa/health/4.asp#Creditable_Coverage"">creditable coverage</a></strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the part you are worried about.  <strong>Creditable coverage</strong> is defined as prior coverage with no ""<strong>significant break in coverage</strong>"". That break is very clearly <a href=""http://www.dol.gov/elaws/ebsa/health/4.asp#Significant_Break_in_Coverage"">defined</a> as <strong>63 days with no coverage</strong>.</p>

<p>(<a href=""http://www.familiesusa.org/issues/private-insurance/legal-rights/hipaa-definitions.html"">More info on creditable coverage and breaks in coverage</a>)</p>

<p>Luckily for you, you've had full creditable coverage, so as long as you have not been without coverage for 63 days, you will be perfectly fine <em>retroactively</em> signing up for COBRA should there be any issues in the few weeks you are between jobs.</p>

<p>If the gap between your coverage is less than 63 days, and there are no health needs during it, <strong>don't sign up for COBRA</strong>, and the gap will be completely inconsequential in the future once you're covered again.</p>

<hr>

<p>I went through exactly this process last year.  I left a job on the 3rd of a month, and coverage ended on the 30th.  I put off signing up for COBRA just like you are considering, because there's no sense paying those premiums (they are insanely high) if it wasn't needed.  About 45 days later, I decided to take a new job that offered insurance the first day.  My gap was about 51 days total, so there was no need to retroactively sign up for COBRA.  Luckily the laws were very clear about this, so I had no need to worry.</p>

"What is the difference between equity and assets?","26477","","<p>I am (going to be) using GNU Cash, which uses the double-entry method; I use it for personal finance.</p>

<p>Reading various tutorials for GNU cash, it lists 5 types of accounts: income, expense, assets, liabilities, and equity, followed by various examples. For assets, it gives stuff likes houses and cars, but it doesn't give an examples for equity.
Couldn't all those things also be put under an equity account (and, mathematically, liabilities could also be put under equity accounts too.)</p>

<p>Here is my guess: Equity represent various ""organizations."" For example, if I had three ice cream divisions, chocolate, strawberry, and vanilla, they would be examples of ""equities."" If strawberry uses $100 of advertising using the company bank account, the company would incur $100 of advertising expenses, loss $100 of from the asset of the bank account, and the equity of strawberry would go down $100. This doesn't seem to satisfy the accounting equation though.</p>

<p>If my above assumption is correct, a household would only have on equity account (you aren't going to tell your kids after they graduate how negative their equity has been to the family.)</p>

<p>I suppose I am having trouble seeing the point of the equity category.</p>

<p>How can I determine whether to categorize something as equity or income.</p>
","<p>Accounts track value: at any given time, a given account will have a given value. The type of account indicates what the value represents. Roughly:</p>

<ul>
<li>An <em>asset</em> is something you control that's worth something, and the value is how much it's worth.</li>
<li>A <em>liability</em> is something you owe someone else, and the value is how much you owe them.</li>
<li><em>Equity</em> is your net worth: the total asset value minus the total liability value.</li>
</ul>

<p>On a balance sheet (a listing of accounts and their values at a given point in time), there is typically only one equity account, representing net worth, I don't know much about GNUCash, though. Income and expenses accounts do not go on the balance sheet, but to find out more, either someone else or the GNUCash manual will have to describe how they work in detail.</p>

<p>Equity is more similar to a liability than to assets. The equation Assets = Equity + Liabilities should always hold; you can think of assets as being ""what my stuff is worth"" and equity and liabilities together as being ""who owns it."" The part other people own is liability, and the part you own is equity.</p>

<p>See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet"" rel=""noreferrer"">balance sheet</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting_equation"" rel=""noreferrer"">accounting equation</a>, and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping_system"" rel=""noreferrer"">double-entry bookkeeping</a> for more information.</p>

<p>(A corporate balance sheet might actually have more than one equity entry. The purpose of the breakdown is to show how much of their net worth came from investors and how much was earned. That's only relevant if you're trying to assess how a company has performed to date; it's not important for a family's finances.)</p>

","<blockquote>
  <p>Do I make money in the stock market from other people losing money?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not normally.*</p>

<p>The stock market as a whole, on average, increases in value over time. So if we make the claim that the market is a zero-sum game, and you only make money if other people lose money, that idea is not sustainable. There aren't that many people that would keep investing in something only to continue to lose money to the ""winners.""</p>

<p>The stock market, and the companies inside it, grow in value as the economy grows. And the economy grows as workers add value with their work. </p>

<p>Here's an analogy: I can buy a tree seed for very little and plant it in the ground. If I do nothing more, it probably won't grow, and it will be worth nothing. However, by taking the time to water it, fertilize it, weed it, prune it, and harvest it, I can sell the produce for much more than I purchased that seed for. No one lost money when I sell it; I increased the value by adding my effort. </p>

<p>If I sell that tree to a sawmill, they can cut the tree into usable lumber, and sell that lumber at a profit. They added their efforts and increased the value.  A carpenter can increase the value even further by making something useful (a door, for example). A retail store can make that door more useful by transporting it to a location with a buyer, and a builder can make it even more useful by installing it on a house. </p>

<p>No one lost any money in any of these transactions. They bought something valuable, and made it more valuable by adding their effort. </p>

<p>Companies in the stock market grow in value the same way. A company will grow in value as its employees produce things. An investor provides capital that the company uses to be able to produce things**, and as the company grows, it increases in value. As the population increases and more workers and customers are born, and as more useful things are invented, the economy will continue to grow as a whole. </p>

<hr>

<p><sub>* Certainly, it is <em>possible</em>, even common, to profit from someone else's loss.  People lose money in the stock market all the time.  But it doesn't have to be this way.  The stock market goes up, on average, over the long term, and so long term investors can continue to make money in the market even without profiting from others' failures.</sub></p>

<p><sub>** An investor that purchases a share from another investor does not <em>directly</em> provide capital to the company.  However, this second investor is rewarding the first investor who did provide capital to the company.  This is the reason that the first investor purchased in the first place; without the second investor, the first would have had no reason to invest and provide the capital.  Relating it to our tree analogy: Did the builder who installed the door help out the tree farmer?  After all, the tree farmer already sold the tree to the sawmill and doesn't care what happens to it after that.  However, if the builder had not needed a door, the sawmill would have had no reason to buy the tree.</sub></p>

"For very high-net worth individuals, does it make sense to not have insurance?","26362","","<p>Various types of insurance (health, car, life) protect you from relatively low probability but very expensive events in life (cancer, serious car accident, etc.) For the average person, it makes sense to have these kinds of insurance, because we could go bankrupt if one of these events happened.</p>

<p>On average, however, the insured lose money and the insurance companies make money.  Not that it is a bad thing; insurance companies do provide a valuable service.</p>

<p>Very wealthy individuals can absorb the cost of expensive events. It seems that they would save money and aggravation by not having insurance at all (because some insurance companies are difficult to deal with).</p>

<p>For a very wealthy person, does it make sense to not have common types of insurance (where not required by law)?  How would one determine whether they are better off without insurance?</p>
","<p>Yes, and the math that tells you when is called the Kelly Criterion.</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion"" rel=""noreferrer"">Kelly Criterion</a> is on its face about how much you should bet on a positive-sum game.</p>

<p>Imagine you have a game where you flip a coin, and if heads you are given 3 times your bet, and if tails you lose your bet.  Naively you'd think ""great, I should play, and bet every dollar I have!"" -- after all, it has a 50% average return on investment.  You get back on average 1.5$ for every dollar you bet, so every dollar you don't bet is a 0.5$ loss.</p>

<p>But if you do this and you play every day for 10 years, you'll almost always end up bankrupt.  Funny that.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you bet nothing, you are losing out on a great investment.  So under certain assumptions, you neither want to bet everything, nor do you want to bet nothing (assuming you can repeat the bet almost indefinitely).</p>

<p>The question then becomes, what percentage of your bankroll should you bet?</p>

<p>Kelly Criterion answers this question.  The typical Kelly Criterion case is where we are making a bet with positive returns, not an insurance against loss; but with a bit of mathematical trickery, we can use it to determine how much you should spend on insuring against loss.</p>

<p>An ""easy"" way to understand the Kelly Criterion is that you want to maximize the logarithm of your worth in a given period.  Such a maximization results in the largest long-term value in some sense.</p>

<p>Let us give it a try in an insurance case.</p>

<p>Suppose you have a 1 million dollar asset.  It has a 1% chance per year of being destroyed by some random event (flood, fire, taxes, pitchforks).</p>

<p>You can buy insurance against this for 2% of its value per year.  It even covers pitchforks.</p>

<p>On its face this looks like a bad deal.  Your expected loss is only 1%, but the cost to hide the loss is 2%?</p>

<p>If this is your only asset, then the loss makes your net worth 0.  The log of zero is negative infinity.  Under Kelly, any insurance (no matter how inefficient) is worth it.  This is a bit of an extreme case, and we'll cover why it doesn't apply even when it seems like it does elsewhere.</p>

<p>Now suppose you have 1 million dollars in other assets.  In the insured case, we always end the year with 1.98 million dollars, regardless of if the disaster happens.  In the non-insured case, 99% of the time we have 2 million dollars, and 1% of the time we have 1 million dollars.</p>

<p>We want to maximize the expected log value of our worth.  We have log(2 million - 20,000) (the insured case) vs 1% * log(1 million) + 99% * log(2 million).</p>

<p>Or 14.49 (insured) vs 13.7953 (uninsured).  The Kelly Criterion says insurance is worth it; note that you could ""afford"" to replace your home, but because it makes up so much of your net worth, Kelly says the ""hit it too painful"" and you should just pay for insurance.</p>

<p>Now suppose you are worth 1 billion.  We have log(1 billion - 20k) on the insured side, and 1%*log(999 million) + 99% * log(1 billion) on the uninsured side.</p>

<p>The logs of each side are 20.72 (insured) vs 21.42 (uninsured).  (Note that the base of the logarithm doesn't matter; so long as you use the same base on each side).</p>

<p>According to Kelly, we have found a case where insurance isn't worth it.</p>

<p>The Kelly Criterion roughly tells you ""if I took this bet every (period of time), would I be on average richer after (many repeats of this bet) than if I didn't take this bet?""  When the answer is ""no"", it implies self-insurance is more efficient than using external insurance.  The answer is going to be sensitive to the profit margin of the insurance product you are buying, and the size of the asset relative to your total wealth.</p>

<p>Now, the Kelly Criterion can easily be misapplied.  Being worth financially zero in current assets can easily ignore non-financial assets (like your ability to work, or friends, or whatever).  And it presumes repeat to infinity, and people tend not to live that long.</p>

<p>But it is a good starting spot.</p>

<p>Note that the option of bankruptcy can easily make insurance not ""worth it"" for people far poorer; this is one of the reasons why banks insist you have insurance on your property.</p>

<p>You can use Kelly to calculate how much insurance you should purchase at a given profit margin for the insurance company given your net worth and the risk involved.  This can be used in Finance to work out how much you should hedge your bets in an investment as well; in effect, it quantifies how having money makes it easier to make money.</p>

"Are lottery tickets ever a wise investment provided the jackpot is large enough?","26353","","<p>If the odds of winning a lottery jackpot are one in 292 million, and the jackpot prize is expected to be greater than than $1 billion, does this make a lottery ticket a wise investment?

<p>I know there is a risk that I'll lose my investment, and also a risk that <strong>if</strong> I do win then I may have to share the jackpot with other winners. However, there are also some other, smaller prizes available.</p>

<p>For example: if you were to take a dollar from me on the promise that you'd give me $3 back if i guessed the result of a single, fair coin toss, then I'd probably take this offer (as the odds of me guessing correctly are one in two, yet the potential returns are threefold).</p>
","<p>You're asking if lottery ticket can ever produce a positive <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value"">expected value</a> (EV). The short answer is, ""no"". There's an <a href=""http://www.circlemud.org/jelson/megamillions/"">interesting article</a> that goes into the details and is heavy on the math and graphs. The key point:</p>

<p>Even if you think you have a positive expected value due to the size of the jackpot being larger than the number of possible numbers, as more tickets are purchased (and the jackpot grows larger) the odds of someone else picking the winner goes up and your EV goes down. The article concludes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[It] ... paints a grim picture for anyone
  still holding out hope that a lottery ticket can ever be an
  economically rational investment. As the jackpot grows in value, the
  number of people who try to win it grows super-linearly. This human
  behavior has a mathematical consequence: even though the jackpot
  itself can theoretically grow without bound, there is a point at which
  the consequent ticket-buying grows to such a fever pitch that the
  expected value of the jackpot actually starts going down again.</p>

"Will upgrading my credit card affect my credit history length?","26255","","<p><strong>Background:</strong> I recently graduated from college.  I have had a student credit card (Visa) with Wells Fargo since 2008 and it is my only credit card. Obviously, I do not want the history of this card to go away since it is my oldest account.</p>

<p>Being a simple student credit card, it doesn't really offer the perks that I would like (such as cash back).  For this reason, I would like to apply for a Cash-Back card with Wells Fargo and close the old one, essentially upgrading my credit card with them.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Will my financial institution report the new credit card as a new account to FICO and wipe out the old account or will they simply attach the new credit card to the same account and continue to report the original start date? Do financial institutions generally handle it the same way or is it a case-by-case/bank-by-bank situation?</p>

<p>I do plan on going in and asking in person, but I want to educate myself beforehand.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Added the conclusion</p>

<p><strong>The Conclusion</strong>:</p>

<p>I ended up waiting for a while since I wasn't in any dire need to upgrade my card to a cash-back one. During the summer, Wells Fargo automatically upgraded my college student credit card to an unsecured, real, big-boy credit card with an increase of about $1800 to the credit limit. </p>

<p>A few months after that (last week) I decided to see if I could use their new-found trust in me to make the card do a little more for me, I went into the local branch and spoke with a service member and she informed me that when Wells Fargo upgrades a credit card, they maintain the same account (same number and everything) and simply change the account type.</p>

<p>I made sure to clarify that I was not interested in risking closing the account (should I be rejected for upgrade) in three or four different ways, and she explained that that would not be an issue. Right there, at her desk, she called to upgrade the credit card to a cash-back one. The person on the other end informed her that the promotion to do that had just ended. So, apparently they have windows of time where they upgrade credit cards to cash-back/rewards and I had just missed it.</p>

<p>However, I was informed that these promotions come and go and that she would keep an eye out for me and once the opportunity presents itself, she will call me and ask for permission to upgrade to a cash-back card and that should be the end of that.</p>
","<p>You'll really have to ask your bank about this specifically. An ""upgrade"" or ""replacement card"" would likely maintain the same open date and essentially show up as the same account, but applying for a new one and closing the old one would almost certainly be reported as a new account.</p>

<p>I would do this carefully, and only allow it to go through if it is obviously an ""upgrade"". If there are two separate transactions (open a new account and close the old one) then I would not close the old one.</p>

<p>That said, why not just open a new account with another credit card company or bank? That's absolutely risk-free!</p>

<p>Investor D comes along and wants to buy 5 shares for $14 each. So a sale is finally made. At this point, the stock quote moves to $14. The ask price is $20 x10 and the bid price is $10 x15. No further trading will occur until another investor is willing to buy at $20 or sell at $10. </p>

"Is Aspiration Summit too good to be true?","25864","","<p>I recently heard about <a href=""https://www.aspiration.com/summit/"">Aspiration Summit</a> through Facebook. It's a checking account offering 1.00% APY, no maintenance fees, no fees at certain ATMs, and reimbursements for the fees at all other ATMs.</p>

<p>My question is, what's the catch? This definitely sounds too good to be true, but I haven't been able to find anything that resembles a catch anywhere on their website.</p>
","<p>I hadn't heard of it, but it looks legitimate to me. In the fine print on the product description page, it mentions that the account is backed by Radius Bank, which is a real <a href=""https://www5.fdic.gov/IDASP/confirmation.asp?inCert1=32551&amp;AsOf=MostCurrent&amp;Refer=ID"">FDIC member</a> (so it's at least not transparently a scam).</p>

<p>One caveat to note in the fine print on the product page you link to is that the 1.00% APY applies only to balances over $2500, but it does apply to the whole balance in that case, not just the excess amount. For lower-value accounts, the APY is 0.25%. For comparison, I'm currently getting 0.75% in my Capital One 360 savings account and 0.20% in checking. The US dollar 1-month <a href=""http://www.global-rates.com/interest-rates/libor/libor.aspx"">LIBOR</a>* is 0.19700%, and 1-year is 0.93260%, as of 2015-11-13. So the rates are very good but not ridiculous: in my humble assessment, they're probably not making much profit on them, but they're not taking much of a loss, either.</p>

<p>The structure of the outright fees seems in line with what the good deals from other banks often look like.</p>

<p>The above assessment (interest rates are priced roughly ""at cost"") seems consistent with their philosophy as described on their website. See, for example, <a href=""https://support.aspiration.com/hc/en-us/articles/205172100-How-does-Aspiration-make-money-"">""How Does Aspiration Make Money""</a> in their FAQ:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We work for tips. The only money we make is what you decide to pay us. We let you choose an amount from $0 to $6 a month when you first sign up for an account and you can change it any time. You get charged on a monthly basis at whatever level you’ve chosen on the last day of the month. We’ve designed it so that you’re under no legal obligation to pay us. However, having worked hard to create and operate the Aspiration Summit Account for you, we hope we can count on you!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fair enough, but <strong>be careful</strong> about how generous you get with the tips! Six dollars a month on a $2500 balance is 6 / 2500 * 12 = 2.88% per year, a significant fee in bank-world.</p>

<p>So, in conclusion:</p>

<ul>
<li>Be aware that the <strong>1% APY applies only if you keep a balance over $2500</strong>.</li>
<li>The interest rates and fees are a <strong>good deal</strong>, but not so far out of line with the market so as to arouse suspicion.</li>
<li>They appear to run their main operation ""at cost,"" and <strong>earn their profit on a ""pay what you think is fair"" model</strong>.</li>
<li>Be aware that the <strong>tips can be deceptively high</strong>.</li>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/r0Auh.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Does anyone know which is correct? Are they using two different calculations?</p>
","<p>The difference is that Yahoo is showing the unadjusted price that the security traded for on that date, while google is <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/google-finance/GWPc-8COV3I"" rel=""noreferrer"">adjusting for price splits</a>. This means that Google is showing how much you would have had to pay to get what is now one share. Since 1979, <a href=""http://www.investor.jnj.com/stocksplit.cfm"" rel=""noreferrer"">JNJ has split 3-for-1 once, and 2-for-1 four times</a>. 3x2x2x2x2 = 48. If you bought 1 share at that time, you would now have 48 shares today. Yahoo is showing a price of $66 for what was then 1 share. $66/48 = 1.375, which Google rounds to 1.38.

<p>Yahoo's adjusted close column has not been accurate since they re-wrote the Finance website. It now just represents the closing price.</p>

<p>It seems financially cheaper to each sign up for our own individual plans and put our dependents on whichever one is cheaper, premium-wise.

<p>Is this financially feasible? Are there any catches I need to look out for? Does this impact income taxes (we file jointly)?</p>
","<p>It's very common for two income households to each have separate insurance - at least until you have children.  That's because of exactly what you describe: the employer will often cover a higher amount of the employee's premium than other family members.</p>

<p>As far as for what you should watch out for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Two insurances might mean two insurers, might mean non-overlapping pools of doctors.  Are you okay with this?  For some that's a benefit, for some it's a detriment.</li>

"How do public-company buyouts work?","25332","","<p>I'm looking at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell#2013_buyout"">the impending buyout of Dell</a> and wondering how it works in practice.</p>

<p>My understanding is that most public companies' shares are owned by individuals, or groups of individuals through a mutual fund or retirement plan.</p>

<p>So in this case, if a buyout is planned, the only way for it to be successful is if <strong>everyone</strong> agrees to the buy offer and sells their share to the would-be new owner.</p>

<p>But if it's a large company with millions of shares, as Dell presumably has, how can they force every shareholder to sell their share? How can they make a company go-private if, say, 25% of the shareholders decide to keep their shares and not sell it for any amount? </p>
","<p>Thanks for your question Dai.</p>

<p>The circumstances under which these buyouts can occur is based on the US takeover code and related legislation, as well as the laws of the state in which the company is incorporated.</p>

<p>It's not actually the case that a company such as Dell needs to entice or force every shareholder to sell. What is salient is the conditions under which the bidder can acquire a controlling interest in the target company and effect a merger. This usually involves acquiring at least a majority of the outstanding shares.</p>

<p><strong>Methods of Acquisition</strong></p>

<p>The quickest way for a company to be acquired is the ""One Step"" method. In this case, the bidder simply calls for a shareholder vote. If the shareholders approve the terms of the offer, the deal can go forward (excepting any legal or other impediments to the deal).</p>

<p>In the ""Two-Step"" method, which is the case with Dell, the bidder issues a ""tender offer"" which you mentioned, where the current shareholders can agree to sell their shares to the bidder, usually at a premium. If the bidder secures the acceptance of 90% of the shares, they can immediately go forward with what is called a ""short form"" merger, and can effect the merger without ever calling for a shareholder meeting or vote. Any stockholders that hold out and do not want to sell are ""squeezed out"" once the merger has been effected, but retain the right to redeem their outstanding shares at the valuation of the tender offer.</p>

<p>In the case you mentioned, if shareholders controlling 25% of the shares (not necessarily 25% of the shareholders) were to oppose the tender offer, there would be serveral alternatives. If the bidder did not have at least 51% of the shares secured, they would likely either increase the valuation of the tender offer, or choose to abandon the takeover. If the bidder had 51% or more of the shares secured, but not 90%, they could issue a proxy statement, call for a shareholder meeting and a vote to effect the merger. Or, they could increase the tender offer in order to try to secure 90% of the shares in order to effect the short form merger. If the bidder is able to secure even 51% of the shares, either through the proxy or by way of a controlling interest along with a consortium of other shareholders, they are able to effect the merger and squeeze out the remaining shareholders at the price of the tender offer (majority rules!).</p>

<p>Some states' laws specify additional circumstances under which the bidder can force the current shareholders to exchange their shares for cash or converted shares, but not Delaware, where Dell is incorporate.</p>

<p>There are also several special cases. With a ""top-up"" provision, if the company's board/management is in favor of the merger, they can simply issue more and more shares until the bidder has acquired 90% of the total outstanding shares needed for the ""short form"" merger. Top-up provisions are very common in cases of a tender offer.</p>

<p>If the board/management opposes the merger, this is considered a ""hostile"" takover, and they can effect ""poison pill"" measures which have the opposite effect of a ""top-up"" and dilute the bidders percent of outstanding shares. However, if the bidder can secure 51% of the shares, they can simply vote to replace the current board, who can then replace the current management, such that the new board and management will put into place whatever provisions are amenable to the bidder.</p>

<p>In the case of a short form merger or a vote to effect a merger, the shareholders who do not wish to sell have the right to sell at the tender price, or they can oppose the deal on legal grounds by arguing that the valuation of the tender offer is materially unfair. However, there are very few cases which I'm aware of where this type of challenge has been successful. However, they do not have the power to stop the merger, which has been agreed to by the majority of the shareholders.</p>

<p>This is similar to how when the president is elected, the minority voters can't stop the new president from being inaugurated, or how you can be affected if you own a condo and the condo owners' association votes to change the rules in a way you don't like. Tough luck for you if you don't like it!</p>

"What does it mean if a company pays a quarterly dividend? How much would I get quarterly?","24590","","<p>If I have a single share, lets say in Google which is currently worth 605.79.  Lets say they pay out the dividends quarterly.  What does that mean and how much would I get quarterly?</p>
","<p>Google is a poor example since it doesn't pay a dividend (and doesn't expect to), so let's use another example with easy numbers.</p>

<p>Company X has a stock price of $100, and it pays a quarterly dividend (many companies do). Let's assume X pays a dividend of $4. Dividends are always quoted in annual terms, as is dividend yield. When a company says that they pay ""quarterly dividends,"" it means that the company pays dividends every quarter, or every 3 months. </p>

<p>BUT, if a company has a $4 dividend, you will not receive $4 every quarter per share. You will receive $4/4 = $1 per share, every quarter. So over the course of a fiscal year, or 4 quarters, you'll get $1 + $1 + $1 + $1 = $4 per share, which is the annual dividend. </p>

<p>The dividend yield = annual dividend/stock price. So in this case, company X's div. yield will be $4/$100 * 100 = 4%. It's important to note that this is the <strong>annual</strong> yield. To get the quarterly yield, you must divide by 4. It's also important to note that the yield fluctuates based on stock price, but the dividend payment stays constant unless the company states an announcement.</p>

<p>For a real world example, consider Intel Corp. (TICKER: INTC) <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=INTC"">http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=INTC</a></p>

<p>The share price is currently $22.05, and the dividend is $0.84. This makes the annual yield = $0.84/$22.05 * 100 = 3.80%. Intel pays a quarterly dividend, so you can expect to receive $0.21 every quarter for every share of Intel that you own.</p>

<p>Hope that clears it up! </p>

"Scamming an investor by offering a quick sale of a property at her named price","24556","","<p>My mother-in-law was approached by an old friend who she hadn't heard from in a couple of years with a ""business proposition"" which is almost certainly a scam. I don't really understand how the scam works, though.</p>

<p>Here's the story:</p>

<p>My mother-in-law is a smart and successful real estate investor, owning many rental properties. Approximately 10 years ago, she had a friend who was interested in getting into the same type of investing. She helped with advice (not financially): she helped the friend find a real estate agent, helped the friend locate a property she was interested in, helped the friend through the purchase, etc. Then, about 4-5 years ago she lost touch with this friend.</p>

<p>Fast forward to the present: this friend calls my mother-in-law and asks to meet with her. They meet at a restaurant and spend a few hours getting caught up. Sometime during the meeting the friend tells the following story:</p>

<p>She has been renting out this property for all these years. Some time ago her granddaughter became involved in the business (I don't know the details) and she discovered that the granddaughter has been stealing money. In order to put a stop to this, she wants to sell the property, but she wants to do it quickly and quietly, before the granddaughter finds out. So she wants my mother-in-law to purchase the property from her - for whatever price she wants - but it has to be done quickly.</p>

<p>My mother-in-law, being a smart investor, smells a rat and does not agree to this. So they continue talking and the friend makes another request: She has a niece who lives in Texas (we're in California) who wants to buy a house out here. Could the niece send the money to my mother-in-law, who would then write a check. I'm not clear on the details of this story - ie. why the niece would need to do this - because my mother-in-law apparently shut this down immediately.</p>

<p>The second request is a pretty clear ""deposit money for me and pay to a third party"" scam and I understand how that works (thanks, largely, to questions on this site!).</p>

<p>But I don't understand how the first request works. My wife suggested that maybe she is dumping assets prior to declaring bankruptcy, but that doesn't seem like a scam to me - a bad idea, sure, and maybe illegal, but not benefiting the scammer in the same way. I'm thinking that, since the friend also tried an obvious scam, that this must be a similar scam in some way.</p>

<p>My wife suggested to her mom that she tell the friend to find a real estate agent and work through the property sale in the normal way.</p>

<p>Can anyone explain how this ""buy my property"" scam works?</p>
","<p><strong>It is not always easy to tell <em>how</em> a given scam will end up making money for the scammer.</strong> This is due to a lot of things, such as intricacies of paper trails, or story details that get passed on / omitted (ie: perhaps your mother's friend wanted the money deposited in a weird way that allows the scam to occur, or it was in a particular jurisdiction that made real estate loopholes possible so that something can be taken advantage of).</p>

<p>That's why it is <em>more</em> important, in my opinion, to do what your mother did: reject a scam based on the smell test alone. How would your mother's friend make money / how would your mother lose money in a particular scam? It could be that she doesn't own the property at all, so she would be buying a fake deed. Or it could be that her current tenant is simply awful, so the property wouldn't sell for full value on regular timing. <strong>Regardless, what is important here is that the scammer is attempting to sell a house</strong> (a normally significant and labourous process) <strong>without apparent use of lawyers or review</strong>. It doesn't matter <em>how</em> the scam will work, what matters is simply that, by going outside the very regular methods of purchase (which exist to protect both buyer <em>and seller</em>), the scammer has tipped their hand.</p>

<p>I understand the academic interest in how the scam works, but I don't believe that's what is important. Because if someone answers this with ""the scam works because A then B then C"", then the risk remains that a subsequent, cleverer scammer, will say ""ah, but A does not apply and you are protected by B because of X, and therefore C will never happen and this is all above board!""</p>

<p><strong>In a scam, the scammer controls the information</strong>. It is hard to fight an information war when you don't have all the facts. This particularly applies if you are, for example, trying to convince an elderly relative not to give money to the nice Nigerian prince. If you explain the specific mechanics of how such scams usually work, to your relative (who, unlike your mother, may be naive or even gullible, to consider the offer in the first place), then that relative could perhaps be convinced by the scammer to give money anyway, after carefully waving away your relayed concerns. Instead, you should explain to your relative what they already know - ""What is too good to be true, is, and no one <em>ever</em> contacts someone they have never met to offer them a cut of a $100 Million inheritance"".</p>

<p><strong>So, how would that scam work?</strong> It is hard to say without knowing all the facts. It's possible that the true scam itself doesn't happen for another few days. The reason scammers are also called ""confidence tricksters"" (or, more commonly, con-men), is because most scams rely on an initial stage of building up confidence in the scammer's trustworthiness. Letting the target in-on the profit opportunity (""Help me teach my nasty niece a lesson, and there will be a reward for you!"") is a common way to start. Then perhaps on day two, the actual scam comes in (""Now before you buy the house, I need to have a valid home appraisal per the condo board regulations - but we need to do this fast, and I know a guy who will do the appraisal over the phone, no questions asked. You just need to wire him $500, and you can take that cost out of your return!"").</p>

<p><strong>Your mother had the right approach - if it sounds too good to be true, or fails the 'smell test', then just walk away.</strong></p>

","<blockquote>
  <p>Is this legal?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why not? But you might have trouble deducting losses on your taxes, especially if you sell to someone related to you in some way (which is indeed what you're doing). See the added portion below regarding dealing with ""related person"" (which a sibling is).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The state of Maryland has a transfer/recordation tax of 1.5% for each, the buyer and seller. Would this be computed on the appraised or sale value?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should check with the State. In California property taxes are assessed based on sale value, but if the sale value is bogus the assessors have the right to recalculate. Since you're selling to family, the assessors will likely to intervene and set a more close to ""fair market"" value on the transaction, but again - check the local law.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Will this pose any problem if the buyer needs financing?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strike>Likely, banks will be suspicious.</strike>Since you're giving a discount to your sibling, it will likely not cause a problem for financing. If it was an unrelated person getting such a discount, it would likely to have raised some questions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Would I be able to deduct a capital loss on my tax return?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I said - it may be a problem. If the transaction is between related people - likely not. Otherwise - not sure. Check with a professional tax adviser (EA or CPA licensed in Maryland).</p>

<p>You mentioned in the comment that the buyer is a sibling. <a href=""http://www.irs.gov/publications/p544/ch02.html#en_US_publink100072491"">IRS Publication 544</a> has a list of what is considered ""related person"", and that includes siblings.

"Why does my bonus at year end get taxed at a different rate?","24435","","<p>Every year when I get paid a bonus, almost half of the bonus gets withheld for income taxes.  My normal paycheck is never taxed at that rate.  How do I stop that from happening?</p>
","<p>My best guess as to why this is happening is because the employer or payroll vendor extrapolates the tax amount owed as if you were being paid this amount for each of your normal pay periods. So for example if you typically get $2000 gross (before tax) twice a month, and get a one time $5000 bonus, the $7000 will be taxed as if you were getting $7000 gross twice a month.</p>

<p>I believe the best way around this would be to temporarily change your deductions only for this pay period in order to get the amount of money you expect to receive. <strong>Caution</strong>: By basically fiddling with your deductions here, you are in effect saying ""I know what I'm doing, and by my calculations I will expect to pay X% of taxes, when I really want to pay Y% of taxes"". If you don't know what you're doing or if you make a mistake in calculating your tax liability, you could end up owing the government money at tax time, plus penalties. </p>

"What's the difference between a Chequing account and a Savings account?","24062","","<p>Because I know you can draw cheques from a savings account, so what gives?</p>
","<p>As far as I can recall, savings and chequing accounts exist due to regulations on the banking industry that put were into effect after the depression to prevent a ""run"" on the bank.  </p>

<p>A chequing account is a ""demand"" account, meaning you can go and demand your money, and they have to pay immediately, by means of a withdrawal or a cheque.  Banks used to get out of hand and loan out pretty much all the money they had on deposit, and of course those people with loans just put the money they borrowed into another chequing account and the bank loaned that out to someone else.  The money that people believed they had access to multiplied indefinitely.  However, when everyone goes to take that money out at the same time, you have a run on the bank.  Therefore, government regulations stipulate a % that the bank must have on-hand.  The typical number is 5%.  That effectively limits the money multiplier to 19 times.</p>

<p>Savings accounts get around this restriction by putting limits on how much and how quickly you can withdraw the amounts.  They pay you more interest because the money in a savings account is worth more to them, because it's not subject to those restrictions.</p>

<p>Some chequing accounts pay interest, but you have to maintain a minimum balance.  Some savings accounts allow you to write cheques, but I assume the withdrawal limitations probably still apply.</p>

<p>There's also something to do with deposit insurance (as in, the chequing accounts are covered by government deposit insurance, but savings accounts are not).  I'm not 100% certain of that though.</p>

"Currently sole owner of a property. My girlfriend is looking to move in with me and is offering to pay 'rent'. Am I at risk here?","23983","","<p>I currently own a flat (UK) and have a mortgage for said flat. My girlfriend is looking for a place to stay and it would seem mutually beneficial that she stays with me. She has offered to pay 'rent' money to me, as it would seem to make more sense that I get the money than some random landlord a few streets away.</p>

<p>Neither of us have done this before so we would like to make sure that there are no precautions we need to take. </p>

<p>Here's roughly the arrangement I've proposed, with numbers nicely rounded:</p>

<p>My current Mortgage costs <strong>£300</strong> a month and my Gas/Electricity/Internet comes to <strong>£100</strong>. Current average rent in the area is <strong>£450</strong> per person a month, so I have offered to let her stay at mine and give me <strong>£200</strong> 'dig' money. This helps me out with my bills and is significantly cheaper than what she would normally pay. Also, the money stays in our couple meaning I have more disposable income which ultimately benefits us both as well. Seems like a win-win.</p>

<p>The question:
Is there anything worrying about this arrangement that puts either of us financially or contractually at risk?</p>

<p>Key concerns:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Should I be declaring my girlfriend as a renter and thus pay tax on what she pays me?</p></li>
<li><p>Is there any risk of my girlfriend 'owning' part of my property under this proposal leading to a mess in the future if we were to split up?</p></li>
<li><p>Should we enter into a contractual arrangement that we both can sign to cover ourselves from either or both of these issues?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Edit: after a few comments, I thought I'd add some extra info. She currently lives with me rent free and it is her idea to pay me now that her old lease is finished (she was splitting time between my flat and her old flat). I'm not dependent on her money in any way. </p>
","<p>The rent payment is in principle taxable. However, you should be able to take advantage of the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/rent-room-in-your-home/the-rent-a-room-scheme"" rel=""noreferrer"">""rent a room"" scheme</a>, and the proposed rent falls well under the £7,500/year tax threshold for that. So no tax will be actually payable and you don't have to formally declare it as long as you stay below that threshold.</p>

<p>You should also be fairly well legally protected in case you do split up in future and you want to remove her. As you would be living there too, she would just be a lodger, not a tenant (technically, an <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/rent-room-in-your-home/your-lodgers-tenancy-type"" rel=""noreferrer"">""excluded occupier""</a>). If you did want her to leave you would only need to give reasonable notice and wouldn't need a formal court order if you needed to force her to go.</p>

<p>As JBentley points out, there have been court cases where domestic partners contributing to household expenses while the other partner paid the mortgage have later been able to claim that this implied joint ownership. This was on the basis of a ""constructive trust"" being implicitly setup by the way they arranged their finances.</p>

<p>In your case, if there's a clear intention, formalised in writing, for the money to be treated as rent rather than a contribution towards purchasing the property, I think it should make it very hard to claim the contrary later. I would also suggest you be clear about whether the rent includes a share of the utility bills, and that things like groceries would be handled separately and split 50:50 or whatever.</p>

<p>As pointed out in a comment, there are template agreements for lodgers you could use a starting point (e.g. <a href=""https://www.whsmith.co.uk/products/lodger-agreement-eform-valid-in-england-scotland-wales-and-northern-ireland/90009051"" rel=""noreferrer"">this one</a>), but it's likely you'd need to customise it to your circumstances.</p>

<p>Another point made in another answer is that there's potential upcoming legislation to give some rights to cohabiting partners. In the current draft, those would kick in after three years or having children. If the bill does come into effect, you'd also be able to sign an opt out, but only after getting legal advice, and it would still be possible (though presumably hard) to persuade a court to overturn an opt out.</p>

<p>Overall that does create a small risk to you, but not one that comes directly from your girlfriend paying rent. It's likely that if you are both on an equal financial footing and had always kept your finances separate, that there wouldn't be any award made anyway. And you can't run your entire life on hypothetical risks.</p>

"If I sell my house, will I have to pay taxes on the profit?","23886","","<p>I am in the United States, in Colorado.</p>

<p>I purchased a house in July of 2013.  It was in poor condition, so I spent the first two months repairing things before moving in.  Now, 11 months after moving in, I'm ready for a change.  Here's the plan.  I'm wondering what the tax implications will be?</p>

<p>Current house:</p>

<ul>
<li>Purchased July, 2013</li>
<li>Purchase price: $72,000</li>
<li>Down payment / closing costs: $20,000</li>

<li>Sell in September, 2014 for $150,000, taking away ~$75,000 in cash.</li>

","<p>Short Answer: You're going to end up paying taxes on it.</p>

<p>Despite the home being your primary residence, you don't meet the ownership test, and it isn't noted that you have had a change in employment, health, or other unforeseen circumstances that are ""forcing"" you to sell. Otherwise, you could qualify for a reduced maximum exclusion that might allow you to walk away without owing taxes, or with a reduced tax bill.</p>

<p>You can't even do a 1031 exchange to re-invest into a new primary residence.</p>

<p>You should check with a tax professional to see what adjustments you can make to the cost basis of the property to minimize your reported net profits.</p>

<h2>EDIT: Ownership and Use Tests</h2>

<p>During the 5-year period prior to the sale, you must have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Owned the house for at least 2 years, and</li>
<li>lived in the house as your main home for at least 2 years.</li>

"Please explain the relationship between dividend amount, stock price, and option value?","23805","","<p>I consider myself a reasonably knowledgeable investor, but today was blown away by the fact that I didn't know that a stock's price is decreased by the amount of its dividend.

<p>Nokia (<a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=NOK"" rel=""nofollow"">NOK</a>) closed at 9.31 yesterday, and paid a 5% dividend. So its open price was 8.86 today, and it seems to be trading normally, as if its price was ""normally"" 8.86.</p>

<li><p>What's the point of paying a dividend if the stock price automatically decreases?  Don't the shareholders just break even?</p></li>
<li><p>I assume the price of the stock ""naturally"" increases over the year to reflect the amount of the dividend payment.

<li><p>With respect to options, I assume nothing special happens? So say I bought $9 call options yesterday that were in the money, all of a sudden they're just not?

What if I had an in-the-money option, and all of a sudden out of nowhere a company decides to pay a dividend for the first time. Am I just screwed?</p></li>

<li>The stock price automatically decreases by the dividend amount to reduce ""dividend capture"", which is a form of arbitrage when traders try to buy a stock days before an expected divident and try to sell it a bit later, capturing the dividend as pure profit. </li>
<li>Stocks that pay dividends are making the choice to reward the stockholder with cash instead of reinvesting profits into the company to grow its business. When a pile of money gets paid to stockholders, that's a signal that the long term growth potential is decreased (compared to if it had reinvested the money), at least a little bit. A dividend payment is an outflow of cash, so the company is worth less, and so its stock should probably be priced less as well. </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>What's the point of paying a dividend if the stock price automatically decreases? Don't the shareholders just break even?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Companies have to do <em>something</em> with their profits. They beholden to their shareholders to make them money either by increasing the share value or paying dividends. So they have the choice between reinvesting their profits into the company to grow the business or just handing the profits directly to the owners of the business (the shareholders). Some companies are as big as they want to be and investing their profits into more capital offers them diminishing returns. These companies are more likely to pay dividends to their shareholders.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I assume the price of the stock ""naturally"" increases over the year to reflect the amount of the dividend payment. This is kind of a vague question but then doesn't it make it difficult to evaluate the fluctuations in stock price (in the way that you would a company that doesn't pay a dividend)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It depends on the company. The price may recover the dividend drop... could take a few days to a week. And that dependings on the company's performance and the overall market performance. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With respect to options, I assume nothing special happens? So say I bought $9 call options yesterday that were in the money, all of a sudden they're just not? Is this typically priced into the option price? Is there anything else I need to know about buying options in companies that pay dividends? What if I had an in-the-money option, and all of a sudden out of nowhere a company decides to pay a dividend for the first time. Am I just screwed?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One key is that dividends are announced in advance (typically at least, if not always; not sure if it's required by law but I wouldn't be surprised). This is one reason people will sometimes exercise a call option early, because they want to get the actual stock in order to earn the dividend.</p>

<p>For ""out of the ordinary"" large cash dividends (over 10% is the guideline), stock splits, or other situations an option can be adjusted: <a href=""http://www.888options.com/help/faq/splits.jsp#3"">http://www.888options.com/help/faq/splits.jsp#3</a> If you have an options account, they probably sent you a ""Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options"" booklet. It has a section discussing this topic and the details of what kinds of situations trigger an adjustment. A regular pre-announced &lt;10% dividend does not, while a special large dividend would, is what I roughly get from it.</p>

<p>That ""Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options"" is worth reading by the way; it's long and complicated, but well, options are complicated.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Finally, do all companies reduce their stock price when they pay a dividend? Are they required to? I'm just shocked I've never heard of this before.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The company doesn't directly control the stock price, but I do believe this is automatic. I think the market does this automatically because if they didn't, there would be enough people trying to do dividend capture arbitrage that it would ultimately drive down the price. </p>

"Home Insurance: Must I use money from a claim for repairing everything I'm receiving money for?","23608","","<p>I received a check from my insurance company to replace my entire roof after a recent storm. However, two different roofing companies came out (prior to the insurance adjuster) and said that in their opinion only two sections of the roof needed to be replaced (the two sections that received damage and had missing shingles). Must I replace the entire roof since the insurance company paid me under that assumption, or am I only required to fix the part of the roof that's damaged? If I don't replace the entire roof, will I still receive the other portion of the insurance payout? Is anything mentioned her insurance fraud? I'm not trying to cheat the system, but it's hard for me to justify fixing the entire roof when only ~25% of it is damaged.</p>
","<p>You have several issues at work.</p>

<p>If in the next few years you have a leak in the roof that causes another insurance claim, they may decide not to cover it because they already paid you to replace the roof, and it is your fault that it wasn't. That might also mean they don't pay you for the stuff that is damaged because of the ""new"" leak.</p>

<p>If you minimize the claim that may make it less likely that they will drop you in the future, or increase you rate next year. But if you don't return the excess funds they will evaluate you on the larger claim size.</p>

<p>Of course if they are sending the money directly to the repair company they will only pay the bill up to a maximum amount.</p>

<p>Usually the issue has been that the repair company wants to do a larger repair. The dispute resolves around some aspect of the building code. I had a car repair that had to be increased because the roof damage was within x inches of the windshield, so the windshield had to be replaced. The insurance company eventually agreed but it slowed down the process for a couple of days because they wanted to measure it.</p>

<p>It is possible that the insurance company has rules related to the age of the roof and the amount of damage that triggers a total replacement.</p>

"Does the Black-Scholes Model apply to American Style options?","23559","","<p>After reading the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia article on the Black-Scholes model</a>, it looks to me like it only applies to European options based on this quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Black–Scholes model (pronounced /ˌblæk ˈʃoʊlz/<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1</a>) is a mathematical model of a financial market containing certain derivative investment instruments. From the model, one can deduce the Black–Scholes formula, which gives the price of European-style options.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>American options and options on stocks paying a known cash dividend (in the short term, more realistic than a proportional dividend) are more difficult to value, and a choice of solution techniques is available (for example lattices and grids).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is this correct?  If so, is there a similar model for American Style options?  My previous understanding was that the options price was based on it's intrinsic value + the time value.  I'm really not sure how these values are arrived at though.</p>

<p>I found this related question/answer, but it doesn't address this directly: <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/5161/why-are-american-style-options-worth-more-than-european-style-options"">Why are American-style options worth more than European-style options?</a></p>
","<p>The difference between an American and European option is that the American option can be exercised at any time, whereas the European option can be liquidated only on the settlement date. The American option is  ""continuous time"" instrument, while the European option is a ""point in time"" instrument. Black Scholes applies to the latter, European, option. Under ""certain"" (but by no means all) circumstances, the two are close enough to be regarded as substitutes.</p>

<p>One of their disciples, Robert Merton, ""tweaked"" it to describe American options. There are debates about this, and other tweaks, years later.</p>

"What does Personal/Internal Rate of Return mean for a 401k?","23451","","<p>My 401k statements show a ""Personal Rate of Return"" (also called Internal Rate of Return), and I am curious what this actually means.</p>

<p>Does this indicate how my funds are performing in the market? Or is it just an expression of how much I contributed?</p>

<p>I am interested in the former, so I can evaluate the funds I have chosen. I'm not as interested in the latter, as I plan to simply contribute the max amount my employer will match.</p>

<p>My 401k provider says that their Internal Rate of Return calculation <em>""considers the account balance at the beginning of the period, any contributions, any withdrawals, any growth or decline in the value of the account’s assets, and the period’s ending balance.""</em></p>

<p>Does this mean that IRR is just a fancy way of calculating end balance divided by beginning balance?</p>
","<p>No, the IRR isn't how your funds are performing in the market unless you are putting in the max on Jan. 1 and then not adding or removing anything for the year so that it matches the total return of the fund.</p>

<p>It's a computation of what is your personal rate of return in terms of how much money have you put in, which is beginning balance plus contributions, compared to the ending balance factoring in any withdrawals.  Thus it is how much each dollar you invested did over the course of the period that the return is given.</p>

<p>Something to point out here is that if you are dollar-cost averaging then the IRR is a better measure of how your performance is as it isn't quite the same as the total return of the fund.</p>

<p>Consider the case of a fund that goes up 10% each month and you invest $100/month into the fund for an entire year, just to keep the Math simple here.</p>

<p>The fund's total return is (1.1)^12 = 3.138428376721 which is 214%.  So, if you invested $1200 at the start of the year, you'd have $3766.11 at the end of the year for a gain of $2566.11.</p>

<p>However, if we space out the computations, the end total becomes a mere $2352.27, for a gain of $1152.27, as the compounding is reduced.  Thus, in this case your IRR is 96% since you invested $1200 and made $1152.27 on it.</p>

<hr>

<p>For those wanting the raw figures, here is the $100/month returns at the end of each month:</p>

<ul>
<li>110</li>
<li>231</li>
<li>364.1</li>
<li>510.51</li>

<li>2038.428377</li>
<li>2352.271214</li>
</ul>

<p>In contrast, here is how the $1200 invested as a lump sum, does:</p>

<ul>
<li>1320</li>
<li>1452</li>
<li>1597.2</li>

<li>3112.490952</li>
<li>3423.740047</li>
<li>3766.114052</li>
</ul>

<p>As the final totals are rather different, the rate of returns should also be quite different.  The total returns are different because in one case, the person spaced out the purchases compared to the other case.  These shouldn't both have the same return unless you're going to factor in the time value of money somehow to make up the difference.</p>

"Can I get an Amazon Rewards Visa just for the gift card and then close the account?","23343","","<p>I have never owned a credit card and am largely undecided about them in general. They have their pros and cons which could be easily found with a simple Google search; my question is more about the effects of doing what I want do do:</p>

<p>What would happen to my credit score if I applied for the <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B007URFTYI"" rel=""nofollow"">card</a>, got it along with a $30 promotion for applying for the card, and then cancelled it almost immediately, retaining $30 in Amazon credit? Is that even possible?</p>
","<p>It might work, <strong><em>assuming</em></strong> you can instantly qualify for the credit card.  I'd bet that isn't likely to happen if you have never had a credit card before though.  (I extrapolate that to assume you don't have much of a credit report.  I could be wrong.)</p>

<p>However, it is a gift card, not cash.  You would at best get $30 worth of stuff and shipping from Amazon.</p>

<ul>
<li>Your credit would take a hit from the credit inquiry.  </li>
<li>Then get a small bump from the new credit limit increase and lower utilization.  </li>
<li>Then you would cancel it and your limit goes down because your utilization goes up, thereby making your credit score go lower.  

<ul>
<li>(This assume you utilize credit in some other fashion at all)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Net effect?  Your score goes down because you applied for the card.  This is also highly dependent on the time frame in which this all happens.  Credit reports won't show any activity for a couple of months.  So the up and down could cancel each other out if you do it too fast.</p>

<p>My advice, don't apply for credit you don't want or need.  Certainly don't apply for credit just to get a reward or discount.  The rewards and discounts are only smart if you were already making the purchase.</p>

<p>To expand on the question you didn't ask, it is a pretty solid decision to get a credit card, especially if you don't need one.</p>

<ol>
<li>You will (sadly) be judged on your credit for more things that just buying stuff.  (Insurance, jobs, rental agreements, etc)</li>
<li>Credit takes time to build, so getting started before you need it is important.</li>
<li>If you don't need it, you can develop good habits around credit.  (Always pay it off, never carry a balance, never charge more than you can afford to pay that day)</li>
</ol>

<p>I suggest you join a credit union and get a credit card from there.  They will have programs and better deals.</p>

<p>Once you have the card from your credit union, and you if you find credit cards fit your lifestyle, AND if you find you can manage credit responsibly, then feel free to find a rewards card you like (such as Amazon) and apply for it.</p>

"Is it still possible to ""sign over"" a check at Bank of America? How else can I cash a US Dollar check?","23186","","<p>I'm a PhD student and am due to go to a conference in Boston, MA next month (I'm based in Edinburgh, in Scotland). I've been awarded a travel bursary to attend the conference: nothing major, but it will make a real difference to my being able to attend the conference or not.</p>

<p>The travel bursary comes in the form of a US dollar check, made out in my name. I don't have a US dollar bank account, and the conference organisers can't make the check out in a different name for ""tax and audit reasons"" so I can't, for example, have it made out to my University and pay it in to their US dollar account.</p>

<p>I do have a friend who is based in Boston, and the conference organisers have suggested I ""sign over"" the check to him. They directed me to this WikiHow link on how to do this:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.wikihow.com/Sign-over-a-Check"">http://www.wikihow.com/Sign-over-a-Check</a></p>

<p>The person I'm in touch with at the conference says that she's done this herself in the past, but having done a bit more research it seems that it's less and less easy to find banks that will accept signed-over checks. My friend banks with Bank of America; do they still accept signed-over checks? Any evidence you can link to to this effect would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Alternatively, are there are any other methods I could use to cash this check?</p>
","<p>Depending on the bank it was drawn on, you may be able to cash it there; sometimes for a fee, sometimes without a fee.  It is not a legal requirement that the bank do so, however, so check into this ahead of time.</p>

<p>For example, <a href=""http://www.mybanktracker.com/news/2013/09/25/what-it-costs-to-cash-a-check-at-someone-elses-bank/"" rel=""nofollow"">this list</a> shows quite a few banks that charge no fees up to a few thousand dollars, and others that charge small fees (typically $5-$10).  </p>

<p>Some universities also provide check cashing services, often by or near the office of the Bursar.  Those may cost money, but might waive the fees for students - you will need to investigate this separately. If your conference is associated with a nearby university (of which Boston has dozens), you may be able to take advantage of that.</p>

<p>Be aware that if you choose to open a US bank account, while it won't necessarily take very long (I don't know how much more time it would take a UK citizen, but as a US citizen it typically takes a half hour or so), depending on the amount of the check you may not be able to use all of the funds right away.  There may be a hold of a week or two on the funds (and as long as a month, depending on various circumstances and bank rules).  Be sure to find out ahead of time from the bank what their policy would be, and be as detailed and explicit as possible - and double check with the person opening the account for you.</p>

As I cannot get loan on my own, my grandpa is my cosigner. My grandpa is almost 90, and chances are he may not be around till the loan is paid off. </p>

<p>I have been paying on my car loan for almost 3 years now, never late and usually a little extra. The car was new and has low mileage, but I still have around $12,000 to be paid, and the car itself may have a resale value of around $6,000.</p>

<p>Refinance on my name is not working out as I don't make enough on my own and have a poor credit score from this loan and school loans.</p>

<p>My family members, particularly my aunt (his daughter), are telling me that when my grandpa dies they are taking <em>my</em> car. Because my grandpa is on the title as well as me, I think they can legally do this. She hasn't mentioned taking over the payments on the loan, which I think I would be obligated to continue as my name is on it</p>

<p>However, my grandpa is still alive and I get along well with him. </p>

<p>Is there anything I can do to keep the car? Notarized, put it in the Will?</p>
","<p>It looks to me like this is a 'call an attorney' situation, which is always a good idea in situations like this (family legal disputes).  But, some information.</p>

<p>First off, if your family is going to take the car, you certainly won't need to make payments on it any more at that point, in my opinion.  If the will goes through probate (which is the only way they'd really be able to take it), the probate judge should either leave you with the car and the payments, or neither (presumably requiring the family to pay off the loan and settle your interest in the car).  Since the car has negative net value, it seems unlikely that the probate judge would take the car away from you, but who knows.  Either way, if they <em>do</em> take the car away from you, they'll be doing you a service: you have a $6,000 car that you owe $12,000 on.  <em>Let them</em>, and walk away and buy another car for $6,000.</p>

<p>Second, I'm not sure they would be allowed to in any event.  See the <a href=""http://www.cyberdriveillinois.com/departments/vehicles/title_and_registration/corrected_deceased.html"">Illinois DMV page on correcting titles in the case of a deceased owner</a>; Illinois I believe is a joint tenancy state, meaning that once one owner dies, the other just gets the car (and the loan, though the loan documents would cover that).  Unless you had an explicit agreement with your grandfather, anyway.</p>

<p>From that page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Joint Ownership</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>A title in the names of two or more persons is considered to be in joint tenancy. Upon the death of one of them, the surviving joint tenant(s) becomes the owner(s) of the vehicle by law.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Third, your grandfather can fix all of this fairly easily by mentioning the disposition of the car and loan in his will, if he's still mentally competent and wishes to do so.  If he transfers his ownership of the car to you in the will, it seems like that would be that (though again, it's not clear that the ownership wouldn't just be yours anyway).</p>

","<p>It might cost more money, but you can use the banks own system to order checks. That way you know they have the right routing and account numbers. When you buy a box of checks they will generally have an order form in the box, that will guide you through the process. But you don't have one because this is your first order, or you lost the paper a long time ago. Still use the banks website to order the checks, it is worth the extra few bucks.</p>

<p>The check number is not a big deal. Some people want to avoid low numbers because it looks like they have a new account. In fact I have seen some merchants reject low number checks. They might call them starter checks. They are afraid of fraud. (I have no comment on the logic or appropriateness of their concern, I am only noting that I have seen the signs).</p>

<p>Just guess high. Don't worry if the first few checks started with 001 or 101, so start with 1001. You don't even have to use the bundles of checks in the right order, the bank software won't reject them. Some couples each have a bundle of checks, and write them against the same account.

<p><strong>Duplicates</strong> have a carbon sheet under each check. When you buy something at the store you fill out the info (store name, amount in number, amount in words, date, signature). You then tear out the top copy. The carbon left behind has all the important info (what you wrote and check number). When you go home you can then update whatever manual or electronic system to use for tracking your money.You can also use the register part of the checkbook to record this info. For safety the carbons don't include all the bank info, that way if you lose the carbon, somebody can't get all the banking info.</p>

<p><strong>Singles</strong>: There is no carbon copy. Some have a stub on the top or the side that you can jot down the vital info. You can also use the register part of the checkbook to record this info.</p>

<p>Both types of checks are used to spend your money. You give them to stores or people, or send them in the mail. They then deposit them in their bank account.</p>

"Pay off car loan entirely or leave $1 until the end of the loan period?","22876","","<p>Background information:</p>

<p>I have a car loan that doesn't require payments if I'm ahead on the loan (but accrues the interest, of course, on the balance remaining).  I still have a year and a half on my loan, and all my credit score reports show my only negative as being either average age of accounts and/or number of accounts.</p>

<p>I've got the funds to pay off the loan now, but that would close the account.  I've had the thought of paying off all but one dollar (which would accrue effectively no interest in the next year and a half) to keep the account alive and paid as agreed instead of paying it all off for a longer period of time.</p>

<p>Question: </p>

<p>Is there any particularly strong reason that I should pay the account in full now or, contrarily, keep it open as long as possible?  I know for credit cards the goal is to keep them open as long as possible, but not sure how loans work. </p>
","<p>If I were you, I would pay off the car loan today.</p>

<p>You already have an excellent credit score.  Practically speaking, there is no difference between a 750 score and an 850 score; you are already eligible for the best loan rates.  The fact that you are continuing to use 5 credit cards and that you still have a mortgage tells me that this car loan will have a negligible impact on your score (and your life).</p>

<p>By the way, if you had told me that your score was low, I would still tell you to pay off the loan, but for a different reason.  In that case, I would tell you to stop worrying about your score, and start getting your financial life in order by eliminating debt.  Take care of your finances by reducing the amount of debt in your life, and the score will take care of itself.  I realize that the financial industry stresses the importance of a high score, but they are also the ones that sell you the debt necessary to obtain the high score.</p>

"What's a normal personal debt / equity ratio for a highly educated person?","22824","","<p>I'm trying to figure out what a bad / normal / good personal debt / equity ratio is.  Most sites deal with debt / income ratio, which is a cashflow metric, and I want to focus on assets / obligations.  The closest I've come is understanding that 0.8 is considered borderline for a young couple who just bought a house, and that older people should have 0.5 or better.  For someone newly out of school with an advanced degree, these numbers can't make sense.  School is very expensive, and you can't acquire assets while accruing debt to attend.  What are some normal numbers for this sort of situation?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>--update--
There are some good answers, but I want the specific scenario addressed (already completed grad school, with debt.)  If there is some formula that can take income into consideration (useful because ""good debt"" creates income), so much the better.  Thanks!</p>
","<p><strong>Average person's life</strong></p>

<p>I'm going to say there is no normal debt level. Here's the standard life pattern:</p>

<ol>
<li>When someone finishes their studies in university, and are therefore highly educated, they'll have student debt with low assets, so they'll probably be in debt (negative equity, if you will). At least that's the case in Australia, where student debt is lower interest than a savings account.</li>
<li>Then they'll get a job, rent a place, save up to buy a place, and soon they'll have very low debt.</li>
<li>Next they buy a place with a mortgage, and they'll have very high debt.</li>
<li>Over the years, they'll pay off the mortgage and reach minimal or zero debt.</li>
</ol>

<p>So it really depends on your situation, it's way too spread out to quote a ""normal"" figure.</p>

<p><strong>Cost of debt vs Gain from assets and Risk of income</strong></p>

<p>You need to strike a sweet spot based on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cost of debt, as in interest. E.g. student loans are usually pretty cheap, mortgages are ok, credit cards are very bad</li>
<li>How much gain are you getting from the assets that are funded by the debt? E.g. spending on a holiday is a big loss, a car is a slight to moderate loss, but a house or shares are often a good gain. For it to be financially beneficial, you need the net gain from the asset to be higher than the cost of the debt.</li>
<li>How risky is the income from the debt funded assets, and your own personal income? A 90% loan on a house is a much safer bet than a 90% on the share market. Likewise, a freelancer who's income fluctuates heavily shouldn't be as leveraged as someone working in a job where they've ""become furniture"", or whatever the saying is!</li>
</ul>

<p>Someone who is more educated in finance will probably be able to run a tighter and more aggressive financial strategy, whereas someone who is educated in, say, creative media may not be able to do as good of a job.</p>

<p><strong>Running your life as a business</strong></p>

<p>Someone here mentioned this, I think it's very true. Unless you intend on living day to day, with no financial strategies, much of our lives parallel businesses. Both need to pay tax, both look for low risk high growth strategies, and both will (hopefully) have a purpose that goes beyond bringing in $$$.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Assume you want to sell some of your shares of EVE at the current
  ""market"" price. The lowest <strong>ask price</strong> from sellers is $16.00. The
  <strong>market maker</strong> or specialist <strong>buys</strong> it from you at that price, hoping to sell it to someone else for at least $16.25. That $0.25
  difference between the two prices is the amount the market maker
  pockets in return for taking the risk of buying the security without
  knowing with certainty what price she will realistically be able to
  sell it for.</p>
  
  <p>Fortunately for that market maker or specialist, I offer to buy the
  stock at the ""market price."" The <strong>market maker</strong> looks around and
  sees that the highest <strong>price currently being ""bid""</strong> by others who
  are specifying a purchase price is $16.25 so she <strong>sells</strong> it to me
  for $16.25.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems to say that a market maker buys at the ask price, and sells at the bid price.</p>

<p>But what I have understood before is contrary to the quote:  a market maker buys at the bid price, which is the highest price of those prices at which each market maker is willing to buy, and a market maker sells at the ask price, which is the lowest price of those prices at which each market maker is willing to sell.</p>

<p>So I wonder whether a market maker sell (or buy) at a bid or ask price?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>EVERYONE buys at the ask price and sells at the bid price (no matter who you are).</p>

<p>There are a few important things you need to understand.</p>

<ol>
<li>An order executes ONLY when both bid and ask meet. (bid = ask)</li>
<li>when buying at ""market price"" = YOUR bid is the lowest ask price on the market.</li>
<li>when selling at ""market price"" = YOUR ask is the highest bid price on the market.</li>
</ol>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>EVE bid: 16.00</p>

<p>EVE ask: 16.25</p>

<p>So if your selling EVE at ""market price"" you are entering an ask equal to the highest bid ($16.00).</p>

<p>If you buy EVE at ""market price"" you are entering a bid equal to the lowest ask price ($16.25).</p>

<p>Its key to understand this rule: ""An order executes ONLY when both bid and ask meet. (bid = ask).""</p>

<p>So a market maker puts in a bid when he wants to buy but the trade only executes when an ASK price meets his BID price.</p>

<p>When you see a quote for a stock it is the price of the last trade. So it is possible to have a quote higher or lower then both the bid and the ask.</p>

","<p>From my friends at <a href=""http://fairmark.com/reference/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Fairmark</a> this is the 2012 tax table. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vhOSJ.jpg"" alt=""taxtable""></p>

<p>This is the table of tax due on taxable income, i.e. the 'bottom line' of the return after all deductions, credits, etc. </p>

<p>If your taxable income is exactly $35,350, you are ""in the 15% bracket"" as the last $100 was taxed at 15%. But, the next $100 of income would be taxed at 25%. </p>

<p>Yes, part of the 401(k) process is that you need to be aware of what the tax would have been on the pre-tax 401(k) money. Since a Roth is post-tax money, it doesn't change your bracket, only pre-tax 401(k) or Traditional IRA will do that. 
At a taxable $50,000, you are clearly in the 25% bracket and would choose your account accordingly. You can see above, the way the tax structure works is progressive. i.e. The tax on $35,350 is fixed at $4867.50 and only the amount above this is taxed at 25%. The next $100 or $1000 in taxable income won't push other income into the higher bracket. </p>

<p>Many use the strategy user102008 alluded to, navigating one's retirement deposits so the pretax account saved them from 25% income, but doesn't drop too far into the 15% bracket. A mix of Traditional 401(k), Roth 401(k), Traditional IRA, and Roth IRA, can help you hit the goal dead-on if you are willing to pay a bit of attention during the year.  </p>

<p>I cannot figure out how much one futures contract of gold would cost me to buy if I were to buy it from a broker. I do not have any broker yet or even access to a broker to ask these kinds of questions. I want to understand gold trading, but I need to get past these questions first.</p>

<p>Suppose that, at the time I sell the futures contract, the price of gold is the same as when I bought the contract. Do I lose or make money?</p>

<p>Suppose that the price of gold increases $500 per ounce. How much money would I make in one futures contract?</p>

<p>Suppose that the price of gold decreases $500 per ounce. How much money would I lose in one futures contract?</p>
","<p>When you buy a futures contract you are entering into an agreement to buy gold, in the future (usually a 3 month settlement date).  this is not an OPTION, but a contract, so each party is taking risk, the seller that the price will rise, the buyer that the price will fall.  Unlike an option which you can simply choose not to exercise if the price goes down, with futures you are obligated to follow through. (or sell the contract to someone else, or buy it back) </p>

<p>The price you pay depends on the margin, which is related to how far away the settlement date is, but you can expect around 5% , so the minimum you could get into is 100 troy ounces, at todays price, times 5%.  Since we're talking about 100 troy ounces, that means the margin required to buy the smallest sized future contract would be about the same as buying 5 ounces of gold.  roughly $9K at current prices.</p>

<p>If you are working through a broker they will generally require you to sell or buy back the contract before the settlement date as they don't want to deal with actually following through on the purchase and having to take delivery of the gold. </p>

<p>How much do you make or lose?</p>

<p>Lets deal with a smaller change in the price, to be a bit more realistic since we are talking typically about a settlement date that is 3 months out. And to make the math easy lets bump the price of gold to $2000/ounce.  That means the price of a futures contract is going to be $10K   Lets say the price goes up 10%,  Well you have basically a 20:1 leverage since you only paid 5%, so you stand to gain $20,000.</p>

<p>Sounds great right?  WRONG.. because as good as the upside is, the downside is just as bad.  If the price went down 10% you would be down $20000, which means you would not only have to cough up the 10K you committed but you would be expected to 'top up the margin' and throw in  ANOTHER $10,000 as well.  And if you can't pay that up your broker might close out your position for you.</p>

<p>oh and if the price hasn't changed, you are mostly just out the fees and commissions you paid to buy and sell the contract. </p>

<p>With futures contracts you can lose MORE than your original investment.  NOT for the faint of heart or the casual investor.  NOT for folks without large reserves who can afford to take big losses if things go against them.  I'll close this answer with a quote from the site I'm linking below</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The large majority of people who trade futures lose their money.
  That's a fact. They lose even when they are right in the medium term,
  because futures are fatal to your wealth on an unpredicted and
  temporary price blip.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now consider that, especially the bit about 'price blip' and then look at the current volatility of most markets right now, and I think you can see how futures trading can be as they say 'Fatal to your Wealth' (man, I love that phrase, what a great way of putting it) </p>

<p>This <a href=""http://gold.bullionvault.com/How/GoldFutures"">Site</a> has a pretty decent primer on the whole thing. their view is perhaps a bit biased due to the nature of their business, but on the whole their description of how things work is pretty decent. </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.investopedia.com/university/futures/"">Investopedia</a> has a more detailed (and perhaps more objective) tutorial on the futures thing.  Well worth your time if you think you want to do anything related to the futures market. </p>

<p>When you use an ATM to send money to someone else (like your landlord) you but in these three numbers or use the search feature instead for the first two.  This works the same whether you are talking about Mitsubishi, Mizuho, etc.  The only thing to note is that while real banks use locations for the branch number (i.e. Ueno branch, Marunouchi branch, etc.), online only banks like Sony Bank (MoneyKit), Rakuten Bank, SBi, etc. use fake locations like colors, etc.  This doesn't matter much though.</p>

<p>Japan Post bank is technically not a bank and uses a totally different numbering system, though recently they have come up with a strange formula to convert your JP Bank account number into a normal bank account number so you can send payments to it as shown above).</p>

<p>All of this is basically for domestic transfers only, though.  If you want to transfer money internationally, there are two basic ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The official way.  Go to your bank overseas, and give them the SWIFT code and account code for your bank (likely the branch code will be necessary as well).  The problem here is that they will likely charge a high fee for sending the money, and your bank in Japan may also charge a high fee for receiving it!  (In addition to any currency conversion fees).  A second problem is that only the very major banks even have SWIFT codes.</p></li>
<li><p>Use a money transfer service that can handle both Japan and your other country.  For example, you can use 2 Paypal accounts (Only in the direction of From Japan To overseas, though!), or you can use something like MoneyBookers</p></li>

"How to deal with the credit card debt from family member that has passed away?","21726","","<p>My father recently passed away and had some considerable amount of debt on his credit cards. House and credit card were in the deceased’s name only. The state that is happening in is New Jersey.</p>

","<p>Don't pay it, see a lawyer.  Given your comment, it will depend on the jurisdiction on the passing of the house and the presence of a will or lack thereof.

The FAQ does its best to answer questions but still uses a lot of jargon and doesn't really answer all of the questions I have. I'm hoping that the questions that I have are generic enough that they will apply outside of Barclays.</p>

<ol>
<li>Am I correct in understanding that a Scrip Dividend involves the issue of new shares instead of the purchase of existing shares?</li>
<li>Does this mean that if I don't join this program, my existing shares will be diluted every time a Scrip Dividend is paid?</li>
<li>What is the benefit to the company of issuing Scrip Dividends?</li>
</ol>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Am I correct in understanding that a Scrip Dividend involves the issue of new shares instead of the purchase of existing shares?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. Instead of paying a cash dividend to shareholders, the company grants existing shareholders new shares at a previously determined price. This allows shareholders who join the program to obtain new shares without incurring transaction costs that would normally occur if they purchased these shares in the market.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Does this mean that if I don't join this program, my existing shares will be diluted every time a Scrip Dividend is paid?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, because the number of shares has increased, so the relative percentage of shares in the company you hold will decrease if you opt-out of the program. The price of the existing shares will adjust so that the value of the company is essentially unchanged (similar to a stock split), but the number of outstanding shares has increased, so the relative weight of your shares declines if you opt out of the program. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is the benefit to the company of issuing Scrip Dividends?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Companies may do this to conserve their cash reserves. Also, by issuing a scrip dividend, corporations could avoid the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_corporation_tax"">Advanced Corporation Tax (ACT)</a> that they would normally pre-pay on their distributions. Since the abolition of the ACT in 1999, preserving cash reserves is the primary reason for a company to issue scrip dividends, as far as I know. Whether or not scrip dividends are actually a beneficial strategy for a company is <a href=""http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/3666240.pdf?acceptTC=true"">debatable</a> (this looks like a neat study, even though I've only skimmed it). </p>

<p>The issue may be beneficial to you, however, because you might receive a tax benefit. You can sell the scrip dividend in the market; the capital gain from this sale may fall below the <a href=""http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/cgt/intro/basics.htm#5"">annual tax-free allowance</a> for capital gains, in which case you don't pay any capital gains tax on that amount. For a cash dividend, however, there isn't a minimum taxable amount, so you would owe <a href=""http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/taxon/uk.htm"">dividend tax</a> on the entire dividend (and may therefore pay more taxes on a cash dividend).</p>

"Construction loan for new house replacing existing mortgaged house?","21341","","<p>Let's say I buy a home with an ordinary thirty-year mortgage, intending to renovate the house slowly and live there a long time (ten years at least).  Five years into the mortgage, however, I decide I want to build a new house, but I would like to stay at the same address.  In other words, I want to have the old house demolished, and build a new house on the now-empty lot (while I live in a rental), then move back in to the new house and live there indefinitely.</p>

<p>The new house will be bigger and better than the old, so once it's done, the real estate as a whole (land plus improvements) will be worth much more than the original loan amount.</p>

<p>Is there a loan product that covers this kind of process?  Can I take out a construction loan to finance the new building, and then roll it into a conventional mortgage, the way that people do who are building houses on raw undeveloped lots?  What happens to my old mortgage when I do this?</p>

<p>I suspect that the lienholder may not want me to destroy the old house since that reduces the value of the property (at least temporarily) to the value of the raw land, but what other option is there?  What do people do who want to buy an old house for the location, but intend from the start to tear it down and build a new house?  Can this only be done with a large cash outlay upfront?</p>
","<p>So let's assume some values to better explain this.  For simplicity, all of these are in thousands:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lot value: $50 </li>
<li>Current house value: $200</li>
<li>Current total market value: $250</li>
<li>Current loan amount: $150</li>
<li>Current equity: $100</li>
<li>New house value: $300</li>
<li>New total market value: $350</li>
<li>New loan amount: $450</li>
<li>New equity if no cash contributed: <strong>-$100!</strong> (that's negative equity)</li>
</ul>

<p>So in this example, you're going to destroy $250 in value, pay off the existing $150 loan and have to invest $300 in to build the new house and this example doesn't have enough equity to cover it.  You typically can't get a loan for much more than the (anticipated) property value.</p>

<p>Basically, you need to get a construction loan to cover paying off the existing loan plus whatever you want to spend to pay for the new house minus whatever you're planning to contribute from savings.  This new loan will need to be for less than the new total market value.  The only way this will work out this way is if you bring significant cash to closing, or you owe less than the lot value on the current property.</p>

<p>Note, that this is in effect a simplification.  You can spend less building a house than it's worth when you're done with it, etc., but this is the basic way it would work - or NOT work in most cases.</p>

"Credit Card Security: First six + last four digits","21320","","<p>A company asked me to provide the first six digits of my credit card, along with the last four, to identify a credit charge to my account.</p>

<p>I'm wondering - that's ten of sixteen digits. How secure is it to give away this information? Given that the formula to generate a credit card number is well-known, am I opening myself to any potential issues by disclosing this information?</p>

<p>This is for a Dropbox charge. I have an account with them that I can't access through conventional means (as it was a contractor account for an old workplace) and so they've required me to send this information so that they can verify my identity along with the charge. While it makes sense, I don't remember any companies asking for the first six before (which identifies the carrier and the type of card you have).</p>
","<p>That's a compromise. The last 4 digits are very easy to learn from the person's trash. The first 6 are the BIN number, but each bank has many, so they're not as easy to guess. On the other hand, the missing 6 digits leave a million of options to brute force. Even if someone does guess your full credit card number - you'll just cancel it and get a new one. They, on the other hand, obviously have the full number. So with you providing information which is not as easy to find and them being able to match it to what they have without you disclosing your full account number allows you to establish your identity in a relatively secure manner with a low chance of you being an imposter.</p>

<p>Sounds OK to me, especially if you're talking about a reputable company who you know has already got your credit card information.</p>

"Why can it be a bad idea to buy stocks after hours?","21294","","<p>I've heard people say is foolish to buy stocks after hours. Why do they say this?</p>
","<p>There are several reasons it is not recommended to trade stocks pre- or post-market, meaning outside of RTH (regular trading hours).</p>

<ul>
<li>Liquidity is very low compared to RTH</li>
<li>Fills of market orders can be way off your ordered price (= possibly
higher slippage than in RTH) because of low Liquidity</li>
<li>If you use a leveraged account, pre- and post-market margins are
significantly higher than during RTH</li>
</ul>

<p>Since your question is not very detailed I have to assume you trade with a time horizon of at least more than a day, meaning you do not trade intra-day. If this is true, all of the above points are a non-issue for you and a different set of points becomes important.</p>

<ol>
<li>Enter and exit trades during post-market or</li>
<li>enter and exit trades at market open, using orders you enter one day
before in the post-market session - those orders will be executed
automatically or</li>
<li>enter trades via Limit and Stop Limit Orders exclusively</li>
</ol>

<p>As a general rule, using (3) is the safest regardless of what and how you trade because you get price guarantee in trade for execution guarantee.
In the case of mid to longer term trading (1 week+) any of those points is viable, depending on how you want to do things, what your style is and what is the most comfortable for you.</p>

<p>A few remarks though:
(2) are market orders, so if the open is quite the ride and you are in the back of the execution queue, you can get significant slippage.
(1) may require (live) data of the post-market session, which is often not easy to come by for the entire US stock universe. Depending on your physical execution method (phone, fax, online), you may lack accurate information of the post-market. If you want to execute orders based on RTH and only want to do that after hours because of personal schedule constraints, this is not really important.</p>

<p>Personally I would always recommend (3), independent of the use case because it allows you more control over your orders and their fills.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>:
If you are trading long-term it does not really matter. If you go down to the intra-day level of holding time, it becomes relevant.</p>

"Is there a mathematical formula to determine a stock's price at a given time?","21268","","<p>I have been trying to find exact information on how stock prices are determined but still I haven't found any exact mathematical formulas how it happens. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock#Trading"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia</a> states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When prospective buyers outnumber sellers, the price rises. Eventually,
  sellers attracted to the high selling price enter the market and/or buyers
  leave, achieving equilibrium between buyers and sellers. When sellers 
  outnumber buyers, the price falls. Eventually buyers enter and/or sellers 
  leave, again achieving equilibrium.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That still doesn't tell <strong>how</strong> the price is determined. The formulas must exist, because prices can be followed real time?  I'll give a simple example. Let's consider that there is a Company X and parties A, B and C and there exists 6000 stocks in public market.</p>

<p><strong>At moment 1</strong></p>

<p>Current stock price: 100€</p>

<p>Stocks held:</p>

<p>Party A: 2000 stocks -> value = 2000*100€ = 200 000€<br>
Party B: 3000 stocks -> value = 3000*100€ = 300 000€<br>
Party C: 1000 stocks -> value = 1000*100€ = 100 000€  </p>

<p><strong>At moment 2</strong></p>

<p>Party C wants to by 1000 stocks at price 110€ and Party B wants to sell 1000 stocks at price 120€. How is the correct price in the middle determined exactly? Is it just by negotiating or is there a formula to determine it?</p>

<p>In any case, let's then consider that the agreement is in the middle and agreed price is 115€ and transaction is made.</p>

<p>The most important question is: What is the the global stock price after such transaction?</p>

<p><strong>At moment 3</strong></p>

<p>Current stock price: NEW_STOCK_PRICE</p>

<p>Stocks held:</p>

<p>Party A: 2000 stocks -> value = 2000*NEW_STOCK_PRICE = ?<br>
Party B: 2000 stocks -> value = 2000*NEW_STOCK_PRICE = ?<br>
Party C: 2000 stocks -> value = 2000*NEW_STOCK_PRICE = ?  </p>

<p>How is the NEW_STOCK_PRICE calculated and what is its value? </p>

<p>For instance in Yahoo Finance (during writing this) <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=MSFT"" rel=""nofollow"">Microsoft</a> is valued for 30.56. Where does that number come from?</p>
","<p>A stock market is just that, a market place where buyers and sellers come together to buy and sell shares in companies listed on that stock market. There is no global stock price, the price relates to the last price a stock was traded at on a particular stock market. However, a company can be listed on more than one stock exchange. For example, some Australian companies are listed both on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) and the NYSE, and they usually trade at different prices on the different exchanges.</p>

<p>Also, there is no formula to determine a stock price. In your example where C wants to buy at 110 and B wants to sell at 120, there will be no sale until one or both of them decides to change their bid or offer to match the opposite, or until new buyers and/or sellers come into the market closing the gap between the buy and sell prices and creating more liquidity. It is all to do with supply and demand and peoples' emotions.</p>

"Wife has FSA with employer, and my new employer offers an HSA plan. What to do?","20920","","<p><strong>Current Situation</strong></p>

<p>My wife currently has a <em>general health</em> FSA with her employer. The fiscal year started on October 1. We have spent about a third of the money in the account, but she obviously has not made all of her contributions.</p>

<p>I just started a new job on December 30, and I am in the 30 day benefits enrollment window. My wife and newborn son were on my previous employer's health insurance plan. My new employer offers a high deductible plan with an HSA. If I put the family on this plan, my employer will contribute $1,000 to the HSA. They also offer another health plan, but the premium is thousands higher for the year.</p>

<p>The benefits literature states that I cannot have an HSA and FSA simultaneously. Because my wife has an FSA, the situation is rather confusing. I'm posting a question here because I cannot get a clear picture of what my options are from any of the companies involved.</p>

<p><strong>Possible Scenarios</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>I put the whole family on my employer's HSA plan. In this scenario, I am certain that my wife needs to close her FSA and stop contributing. How would this affect her eligibility to use my HSA?</li>
<li>I put myself and my son on my employer's HSA plan, and my wife uses her employer's plan. In this scenario, can she still use an FSA?</li>
<li>I just use my employer's non-HSA plan, whether my family is on it or not, just to avoid any tax headaches.</li>
</ol>

<p>Is there anything else I'm failing to consider?</p>
","<p>Thanks for your additional comments Sam, that is helpful. Here is an overview of what you can and cannot do with an FSA as it applies to your situation.</p>

<p>The government intends that a general health FSA be used to cover expenses that are usually out-of-pocket when you are covered by a qualifying health plan. It is funded with pre-tax dollars and is on a use-it or lose-it basis.</p>

<p>However, an HSA is itself a form of health coverage that is tax-advantaged, and the balance can be invested. Because of this, an HSA is not considered by the government to be a health plan that ""qualifies"" for use with a general health FSA. However, this means that a given covered person cannot have both of these simultaneously. In your wife's case, if you have an HSA and she has traditional health benefits with an FSA, this is not considered a problem since she can only use the FSA money for expenses incurred by members of your family on her plan. However, if she were to join you on the HSA (which sounds like it could be a good idea overall), she would need to wind down her FSA and would not be able to fund it for the next year. This could be a problem if you have a lot of money in the FSA that she isn't able to spend prior to joining the HSA.</p>

<p>The reason why the government doesn't want one given person covered by both an HSA and given access to an FSA at the same time is that they are both tax-advantaged. What they intend is that people can set aside money pre-tax which they will use to pay their non-covered health expenses. If someone had both, there would be two potential problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>This person would be able to set aside twice as much money on a tax-advantaged basis as someone who had traditional health coverage rather than an HSA, and</li>
<li>Someone could potentially abuse the system by funding their FSA and using it for health expenses, but not spending from their HSA. This would allow them to potentially keep investing in the HSA over a long period of time on a tax-advantaged basis instead of using this money for health expenses as intended.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you do ultimately want your wife to be on the HSA, see if you can spend what is left in her FSA, as it will end when she ends her health coverage with her employer. If the amount you stand to lose is significant, you may need to wait another year until your next open enrollment period or life event (such as the birth of a child) to enroll her on your HSA. It is also likely that her premium on the HSA will be lower, which could impact the effect of ending her FSA.</p>

<p>Recently, there has also been a rule change regarding what is called a ""Limited Use"" FSA. These are FSAs that are used for qualifying non-""health"" expenses such as dental and vision that can be used together with an HSA. This may be something that is helpful to you and/or your wife on the HSA if your employer offers this as a possibility. Please note that unlike retirement accounts, you cannot ""rollover"" funds between FSA plans offered by two different employers as each FSA is a separate benefit fund that is on a use-it or lose-it basis (again, because the government wants to restrict tax-advantaged contributions to what you are likely to spend).</p>

<p>You may also find the article <a href=""http://www.conexismarketing.com/employees/faq-library/limited-purpose-fsa-faqs"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> helpful to learn more about FSA/HSA combinations and Limited-Use FSAs.</p>

"If my credit card payment is due in 3 days time, will anything I order today have to be paid by then too?","20904","","<p>My credit card has a balance of $600 due on the 12th every month (I'm looking to get this date moved to later on in the month, how do I do that?). I'd like to make a $1000 purchase on my card in the coming days, but I don't know if I'll have to pay that $1000 off by the 12th too, or if I can put that off until the 12th of September.</p>

<p>I've been paying off my card in full every month and never had a balance past the due-date, but it seems a bit silly to me if you're not allowed to carry any debt for at least 30 days because you'd have to pay off charges made on the 10th or 11th by the 12th of the same month.</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>I contacted my Credit Union and got an answer:</p>

<ol>
<li>The Credit Card payment due date is the 12th of every month, and that applies to all of their customers. This date cannot be changed.</li>
<li>The payment due date has a grace-period of 10 days. Using the grace period has no attached penalty nor does it affect one's credit-rating. I asked if there was any reason not to use the grace period and they told me ""no"".</li>
<li>Charges made to the card between the 1st and 31st of Month 1 will require payment by the 12th of Month 2. Charges made to the card between the 1st and 31st of Month 2 will not require payment until the 12th of Month 3, not Month 2.</li>
</ol>

<p>So that clears that up then :)</p>
","<p>If you're in the US - then <strong>no.</strong> You'll owe payment on your purchase on your next statement due date (September 12th), not your current due date (August 12th). In other countries, your closing date and due date may be the same, in which case you're required to make a payment on the same day your statement is posted.</p>

<p>Your credit card has two different dates that you need to know:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Closing date</strong> - The date your statement for the current period is posted.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Due date</strong> - The date your payment is due.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>After your statement is posted on the closing date, you usually have a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card#Grace_period""><strong>grace period</strong></a> of at least <a href=""http://creditcardforum.com/blog/credit-card-grace-period/"">21 days</a> (since the passage of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_CARD_Act_of_2009"">Credit CARD Act of 2009</a>) before you're required to make at least the minimum payment on the statement's balance and before interest begins accruing on your balance. If you make a purchase <em>after</em> the closing date but <em>before</em> the due date, this purchase will be recorded on the statement for the <em>next</em> period. </p>

<p>In your case, your due date is August 12th. Your closing date is probably several weeks before that. Let's say it's July 20th. If you make a purchase anytime between July 20th and August 20th, this purchase will be recorded on your next statement, which will post on August 20th. Your payment for that purchase is due on September 12th, the due date for that period.</p>

<p>I'm assuming that you're paying in full each period (as you indicated in your question), because if you don't, then obviously, portions of your balances from previous statements will appear on your next statement(s) because you haven't paid them off in full yet. For some credit cards, the grace period only applies to the balance from the current period, so you might still accrue interest on balances from previous periods every day that you don't make a payment.</p>

<hr>

<p>Note that your <em>balance</em> before you make a payment may include the balance of your last statement and the balance of your purchases after the statement is posted, but if you select the option to pay in full, the amount you pay will be the balance of your last statement, not the total current balance on your card. In general, it's the balance when your statement is posted that matters.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'm looking to get this date moved to later on in the month, how do I do that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This varies depending on your credit card provider, but it's probably somewhere in the online interface, or you could call their customer service and ask them to change the date for you. The change may not take place immediately, to prevent you from pushing back your payment for the current period, but it will probably take effect within a few cycles. Some credit card companies won't let you change this date during your card's <a href=""http://help.barclaycard.co.uk/brochure/credit_cards/anniversary-period"">anniversary period</a>, so you may need to wait until the next period to change it.</p>

"What is the difference between a perpetuity and an annuity?","20761","","<p>Both an annuity and a perpetuity pay a stream of income on a periodic basis. What is the difference from the <strong>beneficiary's</strong> point of view? <em>Possible</em> differences might be: </p>

<ul>
<li>an annuity isn't payable until retirement</li>
<li>annuities can be inflation indexed; perpetuities can't</li>
<li>tax treatment of an annuity might be more favorable</li>
<li>annuities cease upon death, but perpetuities are transferable</li>
</ul>

<p>Do perpetuity instruments even exist in the USA? I've heard of <strong><a href=""http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2013/05/18th-century-debt-uk-consols-to-1742/"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""ritholtz - consol bonds from 1742 to 2013"">consol bonds</a></strong> in the UK only.</p>
","<p>In the academic sense, an annuity is payable annually for a term of years and a perpetuity is payable annually forever.  An annuity has an end date and a perpetuity does not.</p>

<p>Many commonly seen annuities are structured to pay until death of the recipient, which for the issuer can be averaged and anticipated using actuarial tables (i.e. the anticipated average number of years for the aggregate is known, even though individual payees may live longer or shorter lives).  This is still analyzed as an annuity for a term of years.</p>

<p>An annuity may be payable upon retirement, but there's no financial reason you couldn't delay a perpetuity by a term of years.  You'd value it as a perpetuity, but discount it for the future value based on the retirement date.  I don't believe anybody does this currently.  You could also index a perpetuity, but of course that would raise its cost to purchase at the front end.</p>

<p>Tax treatment of annuities can be favorable to the extent that insurance rules are more favorable than one might expect.  But the payment of interest is generally ordinary income under IRC §61, whether it is payable every year or for a term of years.</p>

<p>The last difference you list is the actual rule.  Perpetuities are payable forever, so do not cease with death.  An annuity that ceases with death is payable only for a term of years (even though the term may not be known ahead of time for any individual annuitant).  A perpetuity continues paying, so it's just a stream of income.  Of course, perpetuities could be called back by the issuer in exchange for some value (possibly a cash settlement sum or determined by a formula), which terminates the perpetuity obligation.  But the mathematical valuation is still based on the idea of endless payment.</p>

</ol>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p><ol>
<li>Market-makers (which you term dealers) earn the bid-ask spread by buying and selling in as short a window as possible, hopefully before the prices have moved too much.  It is not riskless.  The spread is actually compensation for this risk. From <a href=""http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/speeches/2011/speech509.pdf"">The Race to Zero</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The market-maker faces two types of problem. One is an inventory-management problem – how much stock to hold and at what price to buy and sell. The market-maker earns a bid-ask spread in return for solving this problem since they bear the risk that their inventory loses value. </p>
  
  <p>Market-makers face a second, information-management problem. This arises from the possibility of trading with someone better informed about true prices than themselves – an adverse selection risk. Again, the market-maker earns a bid-ask spread to protect against this informational risk.</p>
  
  <p>The bid-ask spread, then, is the market-makers’ insurance premium. It provides protection against risks from a depreciating or mis-priced inventory. As such, it also proxies the “liquidity” of the market – that is, its ability to absorb buy and sell orders and execute them without an impact on price. A wider bid-ask spread implies greater risk in the sense of the market’s ability to absorb volume without affecting prices.</li>
  <li>The less liquid an asset is, the more time is likely to pass (and hence more information likely to arrive) until someone comes along to take the inventory from the dealer, and the greater is the risk that the price will have changed in the mean time.  Since spread is compensation for this risk, <em>ceteris paribus</em> spreads are wider for less liquid assets.</li>

"How and why does the exchange rate of a currency change almost everyday?","20209","","<p>How does the exchange rate of a currency change every day?  Why does that happen?</p>

<p>Please explain to me with a naive approach and avoiding financial jargon.</p>
","<p>It's simply supply and demand.  </p>

<p>First, demand:</p>

<p>If you're an importer trying to buy from overseas, you'll need foreign currency, maybe Euros.  Or if you want to make a trip to Europe you'll need to buy Euros.  Or if you're a speculator and think the USD will fall  in value, you'll probably buy Euros.</p>

<p>Unless there's someone willing to sell you Euros for dollars, you can't get any.  There are millions of people trying to exchange currency all over the world.  If more want to buy USD, than that demand will positively influence the price of the USD (as measured in Euros).  If more people want to buy Euros, well, vice versa.</p>

<p>There are so many of these transactions globally, and the number of people and the nature of these transactions change so continuously, that the prices (exchange rates) for these currencies fluctuate continuously and smoothly.</p>

<p>Demand is also impacted by what people want to buy and how much they want to buy it.  If people generally want to invest their savings in stocks instead of dollars, i.e., if lots of people are attempting to buy stocks (by exchanging their dollars for stock), then the demand for the dollar is lower and the demand for stocks is higher.  When the stock market crashes, you'll often see a spike in the exchange rate for the dollar, because people are trying to exchange stocks for dollars (this represents a lot of demand for dollars).</p>

<p>Then there's ""Supply:""</p>

<p>It may seem like there are a fixed number of bills out there, or that supply only changes when Bernanke prints money, but there's actually a lot more to it than that.  If you're coming from Europe and want to buy some USD from the bank, well, how much USD does the bank ""have"" and what does it mean for them to have money?  The bank gets money from depositors, or from lenders.  If one person puts money in a deposit account, and then the bank borrows that money from the account and lends it to a home buyer in the form of a mortgage, the same dollar is being used by two people.  The home buyer might use that money to hire a carpenter, and the carpenter might put the dollar back into a bank account, and the same dollar might get lent out again.  In economics this is called the ""multiplier effect.""</p>

<p>The full supply of money being used ends up becoming harder to calculate with this kind of debt and re-lending.  </p>

<p>Since money is something used and needed for conducting of transactions, the number of transactions being conducted (sometimes on credit) affects the ""supply"" of money.</p>

<p>Demand and supply blur a bit when you consider people who hoard cash.  If I fear the stock market, I might keep all my money in dollars.  This takes cash away from companies who could invest it, takes the cash out of the pool of money being used for transactions, and leaves it waiting under my mattress.  You could think of my hoarding as a type of demand for currency, or you could think of it as a reduction in the supply of currency available to conduct transactions.</p>

<p>The full picture can be a bit more complicated, if you look at every way currencies are used globally, with swaps and various exchange contracts and futures, but this gives the basic story of where prices come from, that they are not set by some price fixer but are driven by market forces.  </p>

<p>The bank just facilitates transactions.  If the last price (exchange rate) is 1.2 Dollars per Euro, and the bank gets more requests to buy USD for Euros than Euros for USD, it adjusts the rate downwards until the buying pressure is even.  If the USD gets more expensive, at some point fewer people will want to buy it (or want to buy products from the US that cost USD).  The bank maintains a spread (like buy for 1.19 and sell for 1.21) so it can take a profit.</p>

<p>You should think of currency like any other commodity, and consider purchases for currency as a form of barter.  The value of currency is merely a convention, but it works.  The currency is needed in transactions, so it maintains value in this global market of bartering goods/services and other currencies.  As supply and demand for this and other commodities/goods/services fluctuate, so does the quantity of any particular currency necessary to conduct any of these transactions.</p>

<p>A official ""basket of goods"" and the price of those goods is used to determine consumer price indexes / inflation etc.  The official price of this particular basket of goods is not a fundamental driver of exchange rates on a day to day basis.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>No, in general you cannot make an early <strong>withdrawal</strong> penalty-free from a 403(b) account to use towards the purchase of a home. Withdrawals before age 59 1/2 are generally subject to the 10% early withdrawal penalty, on top of ordinary income tax.</p>

<p><em>Some</em> 403(b) plans may allow for a <strong>loan</strong>, but the availability and conditions vary by plan. If you'd consider a loan, you should check with your plan administrator or your plan's Summary Plan Description &ndash; often available at one's company intranet or HR web site.  (I do contract work for an HR consulting firm that assists others in building such sites, and SPDs are usually something made available for download in a ""Retirement"" or ""Wealth"" section of such web sites.)</p>

<p>Note that a <em>loan</em> from a 403(b) would need to be paid back into the plan over some period of time, e.g. 5 years, though I have come across examples of <a href=""http://atyourservice.ucop.edu/forms%5Fpubs/misc/403bloan.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">some</a> <a href=""http://www.mcc.edu/hr/pdf/403b%5FFAQ.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">plans</a> that do permit a longer pay back period of 10, 15, even 30 years <em>if the loan is used for a home purchase.</em>  But consider this article: <a href=""http://www.403bwise.com/wisemoves/403bloan%5Fwc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">The 403(b) Loan: The New Debtors Prison?</a></p>

<p>Finally, to your last point:  Yes, if you have an <strong>IRA</strong>, there are rules permitting withdrawal of up to $10,000 <em>penalty</em>-free for use towards the purchase of a first home.  See page 53 in <a href=""http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p590.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">IRS Publication 590</a>.  There's also a good article at <a href=""http://www.fool.com/Money/AllAboutIRAs/allaboutiras12.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">Fool.com: All About IRAs - For First Time Home Buyers</a>.</p>

<p>Such a withdrawal from a traditional IRA remains subject to ordinary income tax.  If have a Roth IRA, you can withdraw free of income tax but you need to pay attention to the <a href=""http://www.money-zine.com/Financial-Planning/Retirement/Roth-IRA-5-Year-Rule/"" rel=""nofollow"">Roth IRA 5 Year Rule</a>.</p>

"Why does the introduction of chip & pin appear to be so controversial in the United States?","19883","","<p>The past few weeks there have been many news articles about the introduction of chip &amp; pin in the United States; most of these articles are <em>against</em> it and citing such 'issues' as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Some people are experiencing a 20 second wait times with these
  chips,"" said Avivah Litan, vice president and analyst at Gartner
  Research. ""We're a more rushed society than anyone else. So me, I'm
  going to be a little mad when I have to wait longer at checkout. You
  have to wait until the very end to get your card.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We've had chip &amp; pin in Europe for years and I noticed that the time taken to complete a card transaction is actually <em>longer</em> when I have to swipe &amp; sign. The explanation behind the 20 second wait time could easily be that the system hasn't been fully adopted yet, and as such it can be slow.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""It's easy to forget your card in the reader,"" said Nick Leffler, another credit card user who has been using his card at retailers that have already installed the new terminals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've never heard of anyone forgetting their card in the reader, but then this might simply be down to the fact that it's 'new technology' in the U.S.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As it becomes more difficult to skim and copy physical cards, many experts actually predict an increase in online fraud.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Besides the chip &amp; PIN, I don't see how it would increase the chance of fraud online, especially since most other countries already have the system.</p>

<p><em>Source: <a href=""http://time.com/4057473/credit-card-emv-chip-and-pin/"">time.com</a></em></p>

<p>This is just from a <em>single article</em>, I used <a href=""https://www.google.gg/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=site:time.com%20%22chip%20and%20pin%22"">this Google search and there are many more results just from Time</a> in regards to the risks of the chip &amp; PIN system.</p>

<p>My question is, <em>why exactly is the system so controversial in the United States?</em> It's not like it's a brand new system.</p>
","<p>The way credit and debit cards work in the US, all liability for unauthorized purchases is on the card issuer and/or merchant, not on the cardholder. Customers have no reason to want measures that increase evidence (and perceived certainty) that they authorized a purchase, and every reason <strong>not</strong> to want it. The same applies to ""Verified by Visa"" and similar systems for online card use - they protect the merchant and/or card issuer at the cardholder's expense.</p>

<p>Here's a great real-world example from another money.SE question:
<a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/68065/dispute-credit-card-transaction-with-merchant-or-credit-card-company#comment107672_68066"">Dispute credit card transaction with merchant or credit card company?</a> See in particular these comments:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since merchant does not have my signature, can that be used as a proof that credit card transaction should not be honred? [sic]</p>
  
  <p>I seriously doubt it. The proof of physical presence is the chip, not the signature.</p>

"Do the tax consequences make it worth it for me to hold ESPP stock?","19703","","<blockquote>
  <p>Disclaimer &mdash; I've read <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/1105/what-should-i-do-with-the-stock-from-my-employee-stock-purchase-plan"">What should I do with the stock from my Employee Stock Purchase Plan?</a> and the answers seem to be both slightly wrong (from what I know) and contradictory, which is why I ask this question.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Last year I took a job with a public company for the first time. This company has two 6-month ESPP periods per year.  The purchase price on the purchase date is 15% less than the lesser of the price on the first or last day.  For the second period, the first date price carries through if it is the lesser.</p>

<p>The money used to purchase the shares is pulled from my income over those 6 months, with after-tax money.</p>

<p>Example (not real numbers):<br>
6 months of contributions to ESPP: <strong>$3000</strong><br>
Stock price on first day (grant date): <strong>$20</strong><br>
Stock price on last day: <strong>$25</strong><br>
Purchase price: <strong>$20 * 0.85 = $17</strong><br>
Shares purchased: <strong>176</strong><br>
Share market value on purchase date: <strong>$4400</strong> (47% gain)</p>

<p>In this scenario, I made nearly 50% gain if I sell the stock immediately.  This is what I'd like to do, since I see no reason to heavily weight my portfolio with a single stock.</p>

<p>However, from what I understand, I must hold onto my stock for 18 months (at least one year from the purchase date and two years from the grant date) for this not to count as <strong>compensation income</strong> for tax purposes.</p>

<p>My questions are</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If I only sell a portion of the stock (say, $3000 worth), is the ""compensation income"" counted proportionally (approximately 32% of it would be added to my tax liability), or is it counted against the after-tax money I put into the stock? (liability being cash-out minus contribution, nothing in this case)</p></li>
<li><p>The accepted answer says that ""it's advantageous to hold for one year"" but also ""I sell out early"". I understand that at least in my case, it's actually 18 months, but regardless, those two statements sound like contradictions. Anything could happen in that time.  So which one is really advantageous?</p></li>
<li><p>Lastly am I understanding this correctly that at the worst case, it will just treat the gain as additional income, and <em>not</em> additional income <em>and</em> capital gains (double taxation?)</p></li>
</ol>
","<p>To try to answer the three explicit questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Every share of stock is treated proportionately: each share is assigned the same dollar amount of investment (1/176th part of the contribution in the example), and has the same discount amount (15% of $20 or $25, depending on when you sell, usually). So if you immediately sell 120 shares at $25, you have taxable income on the gain for those shares (120*($25-$17)).</p></li>
<li><p>Either selling immediately or holding for the long term period (12-18 mo) can be advantageous, just in different ways.  </p>

<p>Selling immediately avoids a risk of a decline in the price of the stock, and allows you to invest elsewhere and earn income on the proceeds for the next 12-18 months that you would not otherwise have had.  The downside is that all of your gain ($25-$17 per share) is taxed as ordinary income.  </p>

<p>Holding for the full period is advantageous in that only the discount (15% of $20 or $25) will be taxed as ordinary income and the rest of the gain (sell price minus $20 or $25) will be taxed at long-term capital gain tax rates, which generally are lower than ordinary rates (all taxes are due in the year you do sell).  The catch is you will sell at different price, higher or lower, and thus have a risk of loss (or gain).</p></li>
<li><p>You will never be (Federally) double taxed in any scenario.  The $3000 you put in will not be taxed after all is sold, as it is a return of your capital investment.  All money you receive in excess of the $3000 will be taxed, in all scenarios, just potentially at different rates, ordinary or capital gain.  (All this ignores AMT considerations, which you likely are not subject to.)</p></li>

"What's a reliable way for a non-permanent resident alien in the USA to get an auto loan?","19661","","<p>I am a Canadian citizen starting work in the USA under a F1 OPT extension (one year).  After the OPT extension is up, I'll probably be seeking an H1-B visa.</p>

<p>I'm looking for an auto loan.  I have a decent US credit record.  An online application with a big bank was insta-rejected due to my non-permanent status.</p>

<p>Advice I have seen online:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ask the dealer for help, they will know all the local lenders and might know which one will deal with non-permanent residents.</li>
<li>Apply for the loan with a US citizen (presumably someone with whom you have a long-term relationship).</li>
<li>Don't worry about it, lenders care about work history and credit score, not citizenship (this advice seems to be not universally true, as I have found).</li>
</ul>

<p>I've heard that getting a loan offer independently from the car dealer is an advantage in negotiating.  Let's assume I don't want to co-apply with a US citizen.  And I don't want to try a dozen online loan applications, because all those applications will bring down my credit score.</p>

<p>Are there lenders who have a reliable track record of extending auto loans to non-permanent residents?</p>
","<p>I don't think that they ask you for your citizenship status when you apply in a dealership. At least I don't remember being asked. I know of at least 3 people from my closest circle of friends who are in various immigration statuses (including one on F1) and got an auto loan from a dealership without a problem and with good rates.</p>

<p>They have to ask for your immigration status on online applications because of the post-9/11 law changes.</p>

<p>Chase and Wells Fargo have a reliable track of extending auto loans to non-permanent residents.</p>

"W2 vs 1099 Employee status","19255","","<p>I've in the middle of an offer for employment. During negotiations, I've asked for more money due to distance involved (Further by far than I'd normally consider, but the pay raise I'd get is basically double what I'm making now).</p>

<p>Lets say I was offered $45 an hour as a W2 employee. They said they are moving offices and it's further away from ""home"" in the near future. I said that I need more money (Time + gas) to compensate.</p>

<p>The response is basically ""We have a ceiling of $48 an hour for W2 employees... but we can go $50 for 1099.""</p>

<p>I've never dealt with being a 1099 employee. What benefits and pitfalls should I be aware of? I don't know what questions to ask or where to start. What will I gain as a W2 employee, at a smaller paycheck? 1099 at a marginally larger paycheck?</p>

<p>Ultimately, the question is given those two options: $48 W2 vs $50 1099, what should I choose and why? I'm not averse to going ""contractor"" but it's a new area and I don't want to screw myself over on a marginal difference.</p>
","<p>Careful. </p>

<p>I would personally need a LOT more than $5 more per hour to go from W-2 employment to 1099 employment. </p>

<p>It boils down to two reasons: (1) <a href=""http://ssa-custhelp.ssa.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/240/~/social-security-and-medicare-tax-rates;-maximum-taxable-earnings"">employers pay a huge amount of taxes on behalf of their employees,</a> and (2) you would have to pay all of your own withholding up front. Your current proposal from them doesn't account for that. There are also risks that you face as a 1099. </p>

<p>On the first item, your employer currently pays 6.2% of your Social Security tax. You pay the other 6.2%. If you go to 1099 status, you will be self-employed as an independent contractor and have to pay the full 12.4% out of your increased 1099 wages. </p>

<p>On the second item, your employer also does your withholding out of your paychecks based on what you tell them on a form W-4. If you're disciplined enough to pay this out yourself in estimated taxes every time you get a paycheck, great. Many people aren't and just see a much bigger paycheck with no taxes out of it, and end up with a large tax bill at the end of the year. </p>

<p>Overall, there are some other considerations like healthcare and other benefits. These will not be available to you as a 1099 employee. You can also be terminated spontaneously, unless you have a specific contract length with the company. </p>

<p>As I see it, not including any benefits you would receive, you're looking at LESS money in your pocket at $50/hr as a contractor than at your $48/hr. Your pay net social security deductions is: $48 x 40 hrs x 52 weeks = 99,840 * .938 = 93,649.92. As a 1099 @ $50/hr you would net $50 x 40 hrs x 52 weeks = 104,000 * .876 = 91,104. </p>

<p>Then there are the rest of taxes, etc to figure out your real take-home pay. </p>

<p>I'm not a tax advisor, but I would be very careful to get the whole picture figured out before jumping. I would ask for a lot more with the added risk you would take as an independent, too. </p>

"How to account for shares in a double entry accounting system","19196","","<p>I am using a double-entry bookkeeping system.</p>

<p>Currently, only actual journals (purchases, sales, credit notes, cheques, deposits, transfers, etc.) are recorded in the system. Reports like Trial Balance and Balance sheet work out Opening Balances, Retained Earnings, Net income for the year on the fly by summing appropriate journal records.</p>

<p>I now have a new desire to account for shares purchased. Tracking share purchases in a double-entry bookkeeping system goes outside my knowledge, and I would be glad of advice.</p>

<p>I have created an account which corresponds to my account with a share broker. When I pay the broker money, I do a transfer from my bank account to the broker's account, which leaves a cash balance with the broker. </p>

<p>When the broker purchases some shares on my behalf, I create a journal which takes the share cost plus the fees out of the broker account. I'm assuming the other side of this journal would be an expense account for the fee, and a special account for the individual share - is that right? I am also recording (in a linked record) the quantity of shares purchased and purchase price. Should this special account appear on the balance sheet? If so, under what heading?</p>

<p>Likewise when the broker sells shares on my behalf, there will be a journal which puts the sale value back into the broker account, and puts any fees in expenses. It would also presumably deduct the quantity * selling price from the special account. And the quantity sold and selling price would be recorded in the linked record.</p>

<p>However, this is where I get a bit lost. From this information, how do I work out gains/losses, and where do they appear on the balance sheet &amp; trial balance?</p>

<p>Supplementary question: What is the meaning of ""Cost Basis"" when showing portfolio value, and how is it calculated? Particularly when there are many buy and sell transactions for the share in question.</p>
","<p>I’m going to answer this because:</p>

<ul>
<li>this isn’t about accounting, this is about portfolio tracking.</li>
<li>you are a sole proprietor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Accounting books only reflect the dollar value of inventories. Which means if you look at the balance sheet of McDonalds, you will not see how many bags of French fries are remaining at their storage facility, you will only see the total value at cost basis. </p>

<p>Your requirement for noting the number of shares purchased is not part of the double entry accounting system. </p>

<p>When you transfer $10000 from bank to broker, the entries would be: </p>

<pre><code>                                        DR      CR
Current Asset: Investments: Cash        10000
    Current Asset: Bank                         10000
</code></pre>

<p>The bank’s name and the broker’s name will not appear on the balance sheet. </p>

<p>When you purchase 50 shares at $40 per share, the accounting system does not care about the number of shares or the price. All it cares is the $2000 total cost and the commission of $10. </p>

<p>You have two choices, either place $10 to an expense account, or incorporate it into the total cost (making it $2010). </p>

<p>The entries for the second method would be:</p>

<pre><code>                                            DR      CR
Current Asset: Investments: Holdings        2010
    Current Asset: Investments: Cash                2010
</code></pre>

<p>Now your balance sheet would reflect:</p>

<pre><code>                            Subtotal    Total
Investments                             10000
    Cash                        7990
    Holdings                    2010
</code></pre>

<p>What happens if the price increases from $40 per share to $50 per share tomorrow? Do nothing. Your balance sheet will show the cost of $2010 until the shares are sold or the accounting period ends. It will not show the market value of $2500. </p>

<p>Instead, the Portfolio Tracker would show $2500. The most basic tracker is <a href=""https://www.google.com/finance/portfolio"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/finance/portfolio</a> . </p>

<p>Later if you finally sell the shares at $50 per share with $10 commission:</p>

<pre><code>                                            DR      CR
Current Asset: Investments: Cash            2490
    Current Asset: Investments: Holdings            2010
    Income: Profit on Disposal                      480
</code></pre>

<p>Again, the number of shares will not be reflected anywhere in the accounting system. Only the total proceeds from the sale matters. </p>

<p>Does it ever make financial sense to turn down a raise at your job?  It was mentioned for tax reasons it did no good, but would not getting a raise have other intangible benefits besides a larger paycheck?</p>

<p>I got a $2/hr raise once that amounted to $50 extra per month because I just <em>barely</em> bumped into the next bracket, but the new gross income was enough to qualify for a re-finance of my house.</p>

<p>When is it bad to take a raise at work?</p>
","<p>I don't know of a situation where rejecting a raise would make sense. Often, one can be in a phaseout of some benefit, so that even though you're in a certain tax bracket, the impact of the next $100 is greater than the bracket rate alone. Taxation of social security benefits is one such anomaly. It can be high, but never over 100%.</p>

<p>Update - The Affordable Care Act contains such an anomaly - go to the <a href=""http://kff.org/interactive/subsidy-calculator/#state=&amp;zip=&amp;income-type=dollars&amp;income=78120&amp;employer-coverage=0&amp;people=3&amp;alternate-plan-family=individual&amp;adult-count=2&amp;adults%5B0%5D%5Bage%5D=50&amp;adults%5B0%5D%5Btobacco%5D=0&amp;adults%5B1%5D%5Bage%5D=56&amp;adults%5B1%5D%5Btobacco%5D=0&amp;child-count=1&amp;child-tobacco=0"" rel=""noreferrer"">Kaiser Foundation site</a>, and see the benefit a family of three might receive. A credit for up to $4631 toward their health care insurance cost. But, increase the income to above $78120 Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) and the benefit drops to zero. The fact that the next dollar of income will cost you $4631 in the lost credit is an example of a step-function in the tax code. I'd still not turn down the raise, but I'd ask that it be deposited to my 401(k). And when reconciling my taxes each April, I'd use an IRA in case I still went over a bit. Consider, it's April, and your MAGI is $80,120. Even if you don't have to cash to deposit to the IRA, you borrow it, from a 24% credit card if need be. Because the $2000 IRA will trigger not just $300 less Federal tax, but a $4631 health care credit. </p>

<p>Note - the above example will apply to a limited, specific group who are funding their own health care expense and paying above a certain percent of income.

<p>This is another ""step function."" Go a dollar over the threshold, $130K joint, and the deduction drops from $4000 to $2000. You can claim that a $2000 deduction is a difference of 'only' $500 in tax due, but the result is a quick spike in the marginal rate. For those right at this number, it would be worth it to increase their 401(k) deduction to get back under this limit. </p>

"Is There A Flaw In This Paycheck Calculation?","18922","","<p>I work at a company that pays their employees every other Friday.  In other words, paychecks are distributed every 14 days, ending on Friday.</p>

<p>Upon being hired, I was told that I will make $300 every two weeks. (I am a part-time student employee, which is why my salary is so low).  In fact, for the first year, I was paid exactly $300 every two weeks.  However, in the past month I noticed that my gross pay had decreased from $300 to $276.92.  I contacted payroll about this, and they gave me the following response:</p>

<p>Salaries are calculated according to the following formula:
G=(P*2*12)/26, where ""G"" is your gross pay, and ""P"" is your two-week salary.""  In my case, ""P"" is $300.</p>

<p>I interpreted their formula as this:</p>

<ul>
<li>If I make ""P"" ($300) every two weeks, and we assume that there are two paychecks per month, then my monthly salary is P*2 = $600.</li>
<li>If there are 12 months in one year, and I make P*2 every month, then my yearly salary is (P*2)*12 = $7200.</li>
<li>If there are 52 weeks in one year, and we are paid every two weeks, then my biweekly paycheck should be my yearly salary divided by 26, or ((P*2)*12)/26 = $276.92</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>The problem I am having with this though, is that the first bullet assumes we are paid two times per month, when in fact we are paid every 14 days.  This means that for months with 31 days, I don't receive two paychecks, but I actually should receive 2.21 paychecks.  Similarly, for months with 30 days, I should receive 2.14 paychecks, and for months with 28 days, I should receive 2.00 paychecks.</p>

<p>If my reasoning is correct, I come up with the following conclusion:</p>

<ul>
<li>There are 7 months with 31 days, 4 months with 30 days, and 1 month with 28 days.</li>
<li>The number of paychecks I should receive in one year is equal to: 7*2.21 + 4*2.14 + 1*2.00 = ~26</li>
<li>However, payroll's assumption seems to be that we receive exactly 2.00 paychecks each month, which comes out to 12*2 = 24 paychecks per year.</li>
<li>In conclusion, I am now losing two paychecks each year, or in my case, I am making $600 less per year.</li>
</ul>

<p>Can anyone comment on this?  I would like to meet with my payroll department, but I want opinions on if my reasoning is sound or not first.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>Perhaps some of my confusion stems from my inexperience/ignorance.  I have always been under the impression that people who are paid ""semi-monthly"" (twice per month) typically get paid on the 15th of each month and the last day of each month.  And, for example, their pay stubs would show: ""Pay Period: Aug. 1 - Aug. 15"" and ""Pay Period: Aug. 16 - Aug. 30"".</p>

<p>However, my pay stubs say things like: ""Pay Period: Aug. 24 - Sept. 6"" and ""Pay Period: Sept. 7 - Sept. 20""</p>

<p>I guess it doesn't make sense (to me) that I would be paid ""semi-monthly,"" yet my pay periods are spanning across the middle of months.  Is this possible?</p>
","<p>The math in your question (and their ""formula"", to be honest) is complicating something rather simple:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Are you paid $300 for two weeks' work or $300 for 1/2 months' work?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>You don't need to know how many fractions of a paycheck you get per month, or anything else.  (In fact, that first bullet point of your top section essentially creates a loop that would continually reduce your paycheck by 2/26 as long as you keep calculating it. Even the worst accounting systems wouldn't be based on such flawed logic.)</p>

<p>All you need to know is whether the ""$300"" you were supposed to be paid when you were hired <strong>originally meant</strong> <em>every two weeks</em> or <em>twice per month</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Every two weeks</strong>: $300 &times; 26 paychecks per year = $7800 yearly salary.</p>

<p>If the company originally intended this and converted to a twice/month paycheck, you would get 7800/24 or $325 per paycheck.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Twice/month</strong>:  $300 &times; 24 paychecks per year = $7200 yearly salary.</p>

<p>If the company meant this and converted to a biweekly paycheck, you would get 7200/26 or  <strong>$276.92</strong> per paycheck.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, the second scenario matches the paycheck you get now.  <strong>According to the information you've given us</strong>, you are 100% sure you <em>used to be paid $300 every two weeks</em>.  In that case, they have committed an accounting error.  The error is either:</p>

<ul>
<li>You used to be paid too much (salary intended to be $600/month)</li>
<li>They misread your contract (when switching systems or something) and are now paying you too little (salary intended to be $300/two weeks or $650/month).</li>

"How to transfer money to yourself internationally?","18828","","<p>I tried to find a question that already answered this but surprisingly I wasn't able to. My situation is this: I'm from the U.S. and I have student loans there I need to pay off. However, I am now living and working internationally and I need to transfer money from my bank account in my current country of residence to my bank accounts back in the states to automatically debit my student loan payments from them. Wire transfers seem like an expensive way to transfer money to yourself, so I was wondering if there are other options. I'm looking into xe.com but I'm really not familiar with it and I was wondering if people could shed some light on that or other options. Thank you very much.</p>
","<p>Hmmm... As far as I know wire transfers are still the best option. If you make sure your US account accepts international wires for free (like <a href=""http://www.tdbank.com/"">TD Bank</a> does) you'll have eliminated most of the costs (assuming your foreign bank doesn't charge too much for wiring the funds in the first place). Also, if your able to, you could consider wiring 6 or so months at the same time.</p>

<p>I'm not familiar with XE.com but it seems it's not set up for transferring money so much as for trading currencies. While you could probably use it to transfer funds if you'd link both your accounts it seems a rather complicated way to go about things. Paypal could be an option if they'd allow you to set up an account in each country (or if you have a relative that could help out), but it gets more expensive than wire-transfers quickly.</p>

<p>As for getting the best exchange rate... I've given up on that a long time ago and have accepted that as the cost of living internationally :).</p>

"Why doesn’t every company and individual use tax-havens to pay less taxes?","18824","","<p>The main message emerging from Panama Papers, Paradise Papers, and the like, is that <strong>it is the rich, powerful and famous who make use of and benefit from tax havens</strong>. </p>

","<p>I believe that an understanding of the taxation system can help to understand our place in it, and how that impacts each of our personal finances. I will try to remain unbiased here but this is a somewhat subjective question, so please bear with me if you disagree on any point.</p>

<h1>Tax savings can occur for many reasons.</h1>

<p>Some of these tax savings are well-advertised, and can be used by many people, such as tax credits for mass-transit passes which exists in some countries. But some of these tax savings are things you never heard of before, until it winds up on the news.</p>

<p><strong>Why do some people seem to get tax savings that you and I cannot get, and why do those people always seem to have so much more money than us?</strong> A simplistic answer can show this in three parts: (1) The source of one's income; (2) Transaction costs; and (3) ""tax loopholes"".</p>

<h2>1. Source of one's income</h2>

<p>Tax savings occur proportionately to one's income, and if the savings apply to investment income, they occur proportionately to one's wealth. If someone living paycheck to paycheck with a minimal amount in a bank account ""saves tax on investment income"", they might reduce their taxable interest from $50 to $0. That's because they simply don't have any other investment income to reduce. All of their income comes in the form of employment, which is typically very hard to save taxes on. Most governments have a very firm grasp on the taxation of employment income, because it is a huge proportion of income in the country (and therefore has the largest amount of tax associated), and because it is very straightforward (work for someone = employment income). A more cynical person than I might point out that investment income is earned by the very wealthy, who can afford to lobby for politicians to pass favourable investment income laws.</p>

<h2>2. Transaction costs</h2>

<p>Even very straightforward tax saving opportunities may cost money to enable. The simplest example would be: if a tax saving opportunity is so complicated that an average person can't understand it themselves, then an accountant, lawyer, or banker will need to be the one to explain it. And that can cost you money. If your tax isn't so much to begin with, then the transaction costs to achieve the tax savings could be higher than the tax savings themselves. For example, most countries have tax savings / deferrals if you start a corporation. These rules typically exist to promote investment in the local economy. But someone who earns $10k in a side-business might not be able to afford the $3k in incorporation costs just to save $2k in taxes. The more income and wealth you have, the more these transaction costs become worthwhile.</p>

<h2>3. ""Tax Loopholes""</h2>

<p>I'm going to generally define ""tax loopholes"" for the purposes of this answer as something where a somewhat arbitrary situation allows for taxes that a layman would consider unfair or unexpected. This often occurs with good intentions but poor legislation - the government tries to provide a benefit to a deserving group or to promote an activity, but ends up allowing another group to take advantage. </p>

<p>For example in Canada, there existed until a few years ago tax saving rules about passing on wealth to children at lower tax rates, only when a close family member is near-death [setting up a 'testamentary trust' between a grandparent and a grandchild could in some circumstances allow that trust to be created with additional 'tax brackets', meaning more income would be taxed at a less-than top tax rate before being distributed to the grandchildren]. </p>

<p>The rules were put in place with the idea that ""oh gee, a family member has died, and the dang ol' family is grieving so hard they can't distribute the wealth to the next generation for a few months on account of all the crying. We should make it so that the estate is taxed like a person, and if they earn only a little income, they have a low tax rate, and they only get taxed at the full rate if they have a lot of income"". Seems reasonable enough, but if a family is ready to pass on wealth at the same time as someone is nudging the bucket with their foot, a morbid discussion with your lawyer and accountant could set your children up for life with forever reduced taxes on massive inheritances. </p>

<hr>

<h1>Examples:</h1>

<h2>Panama / Paradise leaks</h2>

<p><strong>In the case of the Panama / Paradise leaks, tax savings are due to all 3 of the above:</strong> Those who have massive wealth (and therefore earn the majority of their income from investments instead of employment) can afford the transaction costs associated with taking advantage of specific ""tax loopholes"". The simplest example of which is just that income earned in a foreign country might have a lower tax rate than income earned domestically. This is often a result of ""cracks"" in the foreign tax treaties between countries, which exist generally to promote business between countries and prevent double-taxing individuals who need activity in both countries for whatever reason.</p>

<h2>Apple loophole</h2>

<p><strong>Take for example the ""Apple loophole""</strong>. Apple has operations around the world. Some activity occurs in low-tax jurisdictions. Apple reports a high percentage of the value of R&amp;D as being associated with those jurisdictions. Those branches in low-tax jurisdictions charge the high-tax branches (such as the US) with fees for use of their valuable research. So much of Apple's income is reported in those foreign jurisdictions. It won't be taxed in the US until Apple ""repatriates"" the cash back to the US. Until then, the cash sits in the foreign jurisdiction, accruing less tax. This and similar rules can be used by individuals wealthy enough to hold corporations in foreign jurisdictions with low tax rates. How each particular rule / ""loophole"" works will depend on the nature of a specific case - tax law is complex, and the rules between countries are even more so.</p>

<p>These foreign tax loopholes are closing every year. It is getting harder and harder to hide money offshore, and it is getting less and less likely that you will be able to find a country with juuuust the right loopholes for your own offshore wealth. These types of news leaks will only help to expedite those changes.</p>

","<blockquote>
  <p>For instance, they are reporting my income to California even though I

<p>But you are. The US doesn't have a notion of physical presence, you're resident by mere citizenship. In case you didn't know that before - US citizens and residents (those who are not citizens, but pass the physical presence/green card test) are taxed on their <strong>worldwide</strong> income. Where you are might matter for various tax treaties, but that only if you're <strong>not</strong> a citizen of that country as well.</p>

<p>You're resident of California if that was the last State of residency before you left the US, and California taxes worldwide income as well. However, there are certain provisions that may allow you to become CA 'non-resident', check it out with a professional (CPA/EA familiar with the CA FTB residency rules). In that case you'll only pay taxes on CA sourced income (your salary), but not other income (interest in the foreign bank).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now they are asking for an I-9.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Every US employer must.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How do I straighten this situation out? Seems be heading for trouble.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If by trouble you mean paying your taxes, then there's nothing to straighten out.</p>

<p>But do consult with a US-licensed CPA/EA who provides services in the country you're located at (US embassies some times provide listings of those, if not - there's always Google). There might be some additional issues you're unaware of that might affect you (FBAR, for example, various exclusions and deductions, additional reporting requirements...).</p>

<hr>

<p>Chris mentioned dual taxation - that is a very real and valid concern. Even though you're taxed by the US on your US-sourced salary, being a resident in another country subjects you to the tax laws of that country. They might want to tax you on that money as well, and you may have to pay taxes twice if there's no protection in a tax treaty against that.</p>

<p>Note about @Paul's answer: your <strong>personal</strong> tax return may indeed include certain forms that will reduce your tax in the US, either through the foreign income exclusion (form 2555, an audit red flag), foreign tax credit (form 1116) or a combination of both.</p>

<p>But your question was about the employer. To the employer - you're a California resident, and the employer will treat you as such. What you personally do with your 1040 is not their problem or concern, its yours. I strongly suggest you to get a <em>professional</em> advice on that (and if you don't want to pay the CPA and instead learn it yourself - that's fine, but when the audit time comes it will cost you much more to hire representation anew instead of having the CPA/EA who advised you ahead of time defend his advice).</p>

"What are the tradeoffs with the small scale managed fund Wealthsimple?","18693","","<p>I recently encountered a targeted ad about Wealthsimple. From what I have read it is an investing tool for mobile devices that helps you passively invest. I understand that it is for people  who are not too interested in watching individual stocks. They help manage up to $5000 for free and charge a fee for beyond that. </p>

<p>I think this would have been perfect for me two years ago, but I have already started to pick my own stocks and ETFs (some successful and others not so much). Since my career has changed for the better, I find it a bit harder to read news as it comes in while the market is open. I'm wondering if I should try this out with a small amount of money such as $2000 to $5000? Or would it make more sense to just keep adding to my index funds for passive investing? </p>
","<p>Wealthsimple <a href=""https://www.wealthsimple.com/pricing"">lists their prices</a> as follows:</p>

<li>0.50% for $5001 - $249,999</li>
<li>0.40% for $250,000 - $999,999</li>
<li>0.35% for more than $1,000,000</li>
</ul>

<p>Those are the fees you pay over and above what you pay for the underlying ETFs' management fees.</p>

<p>But why not just invest in the ETFs yourself? The Canadian Couch Potato website shows some <a href=""http://canadiancouchpotato.com/model-portfolios-2/"">sample portfolios</a>. The ETF option has an average Management Expense Ratio very similar to that of the ETFs used by Wealthsimple, but without the additional management fee. Rebalance once or twice a year and you cut your fees from approximately 0.57% (if investing mid-six-figures) to 0.17%, for very little work.</p>

<p>Is it worth it to you? Well, that depends on how much you have to invest, and how much effort you are willing to put in. Wealthsimple isn't particularly unreasonable with their fees, but the fees do look a bit high once you are in to the six figures of investing.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I often recommend Tangerine's mutual funds to my friends who are looking at investing for retirement. Those mutual funds, last time I checked, cost 1.09%. That's about twice what Wealthsimple is charging. But they are easy to understand and easy to invest in; a good choice for my friends looking to invest $1,000 - $50,000 in my opinion.</p>

<p>So, and understanding this is just my personal opinion, I think Wealthsimple fits in a niche where Tangerine mutual funds carry too high a cost for you, but you don't want to do all the management yourself, even if this is just an hour or so of work, a couple of times a year. I wish they were cheaper, but their pricing makes sense for a lot of people in my opinion.</p>

<p>Do they make sense for you? If you are looking at investing less than $10,000, I'd stick with an option like Tangerine, only because that's an easier option. If investing more than $100,000 or $200,000, I think you are paying a bit much for what they offer. But, many people pay much, much, much more for their investments.</p>

Now that the insurance has paid their portion, the dentist owes me a refund of the overcharge.</p>

<p>If I've already sought reimbursement for the original amount of out-of-pocket expense from my HSA (it's a qualified expense), what do I need to do (if anything) to make the HSA whole?

","<p>This is referred to as an HSA Mistaken Distribution.</p>

<p>An HSA mistaken distribution occurs when you take a distribution and later find out that it is not for a qualified medical expense.  For example, this could occur if you accidentally pay for a restaurant dinner with your HSA debit card.  It can also occur if you take a distribution to pay for a medical expense, but then are later reimbursed by insurance.</p>

<p>This is discussed in the <a href=""https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1099sa"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">instructions for IRS forms 1099-SA and 5498-SA</a>.  (Note: these forms are submitted by the HSA bank, not the consumer, so the instructions are addressed to them.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>HSA mistaken distributions.</strong>   If amounts were distributed during the year from an HSA because of a mistake of fact due to reasonable cause, the account beneficiary may repay the mistaken distribution no later than April 15 following the first year the account beneficiary knew or should have known the distribution was a mistake. For example, the account beneficiary reasonably, but mistakenly, believed that an expense was a qualified medical expense and was reimbursed for that expense from the HSA. The account beneficiary then repays the mistaken distribution to the HSA. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You have until April 15 in the year following the refund to repay the HSA and avoid the extra tax and penalty that should be paid if you were to keep the distribution that was not ultimately used for medical expenses.  When you send the money to the HSA bank, you need to explicitly tell them that it is a mistaken distribution repayment, so that they can report it to the IRS correctly and it will not affect your contribution limits.</p>

"Buying from an aggressive salesperson","18440","","<p>I am shopping for a new, high-end musical instrument. In the US anyways, pricing is opaque and must be negotiated, and dealers sometimes adopt aggressive sales tactics. </p>

<p>I am considering buying a particular instrument from a particular dealer. I loved it when I tried it in his shop, and internet research has established that it has a top-notch reputation and is considered an excellent value. Moreover, the business owner offered me an extremely good price (again, something that I determined independently through internet research -- I did not take the dealer's word on what a good price is).</p>

<p>So what's the problem? To make a long story short, the dealer's aggressive sales tactics have made me somewhat uncomfortable. Generally I have felt rushed whenever in his store. And on two occasions, he has urged me to buy <em>immediately</em> -- for reasons that seemed exaggerated. </p>

<p>On my last visit, he only had in stock a slightly nicer instrument than the one I had expressed interest in. I knew this going in, and I was anticipating simply asking questions and confirming for myself that I indeed wanted to buy the less expensive version (essentially the same, except in appearance). To my surprise, he made an extremely good offer that he told me was only good until I walked out the door. I felt ill at ease, and left without buying. That said, I am still considering doing business with him.</p>

<p>The dealer has been in the business for a very long time, and although his sales tactics have unnerved me a bit, I am still inclined to buy from him. Do his sales tactics indicate other underlying problems? How can I deal effectively with those tactics?</p>
","<p>In <em>my experience</em> when a salesperson says a particular deal is only good if you purchase right now, 100% of the time it is not true. Of course I can't guarantee that is universally the case, but if you leave and come back 5 minutes later, or tomorrow, or next week, it's extremely likely that they'll still take your money for the original price. (In fact, sometimes after you leave you get a call with even a lower price than the ""excellent offer""...)</p>

<p>Most of the time when you are presented with high pressure sales accompanied by a ""this price is only good right now"" pitch, it ends up being because they don't want you to go search the competition and read reviews. In this case you have already done that and deemed the item to be worthwhile. Perhaps a better tactic for the salesperson would have been to try to convince you that others are interested in the item and if you wait it might be sold to someone else at that excellent price. Sales is an art, and it requires the salesperson to size you up and try to figure out your vulnerability and exploit it. This particular salesperson obviously misjudged you and/or you don't have an easily exploitable vulnerability. I wouldn't let the shortcomings of the salesperson get in the way of your purchase.</p>

<p>If you are worried about the scenario of someone else snatching up the item, consider offering a deposit to hold the item for a certain amount of time while you ""reflect"" and/or ""arrange for the funds"".</p>

<p>Therein lies the welfare state:  Tax the rich more heavily to subsidize the poor, and hobble the rich's ability to do so on their own accord.</p>

<p>In any case, though, in the United States, if you make <em>any</em> money whatsoever, that usually counts as income, and can hence be taxed.  <a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/usc_sec_26_00000061----000-.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Here's the IRS' definition of gross income</a>.  Pretty all-inclusive, isn't it?</p>

<p>Businesses are allowed to deduct expenses to count against their income, but if one has more expenses than income year after year, (a) this is the road to financial ruin, and (b) the IRS puts an end to the tax losses after enough years of failing to show a profit.</p>

<p>So, sure, if a businessperson doesn't have any income, then they're technically using the roads, etc., ""for free,"" but unless the businessperson wants to live off the land and the kindness of strangers, he'd better turn a profit eventually.  <em>Then</em> he'll be taxed.</p>

"How does a bank make money on an interest free secured loan?","18333","","<p>I was having a discussion about the ethics of charging interest on a loan, and I was of the position that allowing the charging of interest encourages more loans to be given, and thus contributes to economic growth and prosperity. Therefore it is a moral good.</p>

<p>However, it got me thinking. Sometimes a bank or loan company will offer loans at 0% interest. I have made use of loans like this myself in the past. But why would they do this? How is money made? Could lenders even continue to operate if charging interest was banned and all loans had to be made at a 0% rate of interest?</p>
","<p>A ""true"" 0% loan is a losing proposition for the bank, that's true.  However when you look at <em>actual</em> ""0%"" loans they usually have some catches:</p>

<ul>
<li>The interest actually <em>accrues</em> at some rate but is not due unless the borrower ""defaults"" (misses a payment).  The bank makes money when people miss a payment, and they get to add on all of the accrued interest to the loan.</li>
<li>The 0% is for a certain time frame, and after than the interest rates jumps.  They make money when you don't (or can't) pay off the loan during the 0% period and then must pay interest for the remainder of the loan.</li>
</ul>

<p>There might also be late payment fees, prepayment penalties, and other clauses that make it a good deal <em>on average</em> to the bank.  Individual borrowers might be able to get away with ""free money"", but the bank does not look to make money on each loan, they look to make money on thousands of loans overall.</p>

<p>For a <em>retailer</em> (including new car sellers). the actual financing costs will be baked into the sales price.  They will add, say, 10% to the sales price in exchange for an interest-free loan. They can also sell these loans to an investment bank or other entity, but they would be sold at a deep discount, so the difference will be made up in the sales price or other ""fees"". It's <em>possible</em> that they would just chalk it up to promotional discounts or customer acquisition costs, but it would not be a good practice on a large scale.</p>

<p>I have a rental unit; this situation has come up with a <em>potential</em> tenant. This tenant has an adult daughter, who, the tenant volunteered, has an unstable lifestyle. So, said daughter will be staying in the unit from time to time as a guest -- not an occupant on the lease. </p>

<p>If there is no agreement about guests, or who can occupy the property then you may be unable to force the tenant to restrict them from having a guest stay there.</p>

"How do multi-currency bank accounts work? What is the advantage?","18320","","<p>I've recently read that banks are offering multi-currency accounts to their business customers. How do they actually work? Is it one bank account and the balance is available in, let's say for example, EUR and USD? What exchange rate are they using and which currency is the main currency?</p>

<p>What's the advantage of having a multi-currency account vs. two bank accounts at the same bank, one in EUR the other in USD?</p>
","<p>Today typically a Business needs to hold accounts in more than one currency. Banks in certain countries are offering what is called a dual currency account. It is essentially 2 accounts with same account number but different currency. So One can have an account number say 123456 and have it in say AUD and USD.</p>

<p>So the balance will always show as X AUD and Y USD.
If you deposit funds [electronic, check or cash] in USD; your USD balance goes up.
Likewise at the time of withdrawal you have to specify what currency you are withdrawing.</p>

<p>Interest rates are calculated at different percentage for different currencies. </p>

<p>So in a nutshell it would like operating 2 accounts, with the advantage of remembering only one account number. Designate a particular currency as default currency. So if you don't quote a currency along with the account number, it would be treated as default currency. Otherwise you always quote the account number and currency. Of-course bundled with other services like free Fx Advice etc it makes the entire proposition very attractive.</p>

<p>Edit:<br>
If you have AUD 100 and USD 100, if you try and withdraw USD 110, it will not be allowed; Unless you also sign up for a auto sweep conversion. 
If you deposit a GBP check into the account, by default it would get converted into AUD [assuming AUD is the default currency]</p>

"How do wire transfers get settled?","18125","","<p>Say I open accounts on Bank A and Bank B. I deposit $20 in Back A. I then initiate a wire transfer to my account in Bank B. I drive over to Bank B and withdraw $20. </p>

<p>Bank A now has $20 extra and Bank B how has $20 less. (In physical cash) When and how does the physical cash get transfered? </p>
","<h3>Wire transfers</h3>

<p>Wire transfers normally run through either the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedwire"">Fedwire</a> system or the Clearing House Interbank Payments System <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearing_House_Interbank_Payments_System"">(CHIPS)</a>. The process generally works like this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You approach a bank or other financial institution and ask to transfer money. You give the bank a certain code, either an international bank account number or one of several other standards, which informs the bank where to send the money. </p></li>
<li><p>The bank sends a message through a system like Fedwire to the receiving bank, along with settlement instructions. </p></li>
<li><p>This is where the process can get a bit tricky. For the wire transfer to work, the banks must have reciprocal accounts with each other, or the sending bank must send the money to a bank that does have such an account with the receiver. If the sending bank sends the money to a third-party bank, the transaction is settled between them, and the money is then sent to the receiving bank from the third-party bank. This last transaction may be a wire transfer, ACH transfer, etc. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>The Federal Reserve fits into this because many banks hold accounts for this purpose with the Federal Reserve. This allows them to use the Fed as the third-party bank referred to above. Interestingly enough, this is one of the significant ways in which the Fed makes a profit, because it, along with every other bank and routing agent in the process, collects a miniscule fee on this process. </p>

<p>You'll often find sources that state that Fedwire is only for transferring large transactions; while this is technically correct, it's important to understand that financial institutions don't settle every wire transfer or payment immediately. Although the orders are put in immediately, the financial institutions settle their transactions in bulk at the end of the business day, and even then they normally only settle the difference. So, if Chase owes Bank of America $1M, and Bank of America owes Chase $750K, they don't send these as two transactions; Chase simply credits BAC $250K. </p>

<h3>ACH transfers</h3>

<p>You didn't specifically ask about <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_clearing_house"">ACH</a> transfers, which as littleadv pointed out, are different from wire transfers, but since ACH transfers can often form a part of the whole process, I'll explain that process too. ACH is a payment processing system that works through the Federal Reserve system, among others. The Federal Reserve (through the Fedline and FedACH systems) is by far the largest payment processor. </p>

<p>The physical cash itself isn't transferred; in simple terms, the money is transferred through the ACH system between the accounts each bank maintains at the Federal Reserve. </p>

<p>Here is a simple example of how the process works (I'm summarizing the example from Wikipedia). Let's say that Bob has an account with Chase and wants to get his paycheck from his employer, Stack Exchange, directly deposited into this account. Assume that Stack Exchange uses Bank of America as their bank. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Bob, the <strong>receiver</strong>, fills out a direct deposit authorization form and gives it to his employer, called the <strong>originator.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Once the originator has the authorization, they create an entry with an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ODFI"">Originating Depository Financial Institution</a>, which acts as a middleman between a payment processor (like the Federal Reserve) and the originator. The ODFI ensures that the transaction complies with the relevant regulations. In this example, Bank of America is the ODFI. </p></li>
<li><p>Bank of America (the ODFI) converts the transaction request into an ACH entry and submits it, through an ACH operator, to the Receiving Depository Financial Institution (RDFI), which in this case is Chase bank. Chase credits (deposits) the paycheck in Bob's account. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>The Federal Reserve fits into all of this in several ways. Through systems like Fedline and FedACH, the Fed acts as an ACH operator, and the banks themselves also maintain accounts at the Federal Reserve, so it's the institution that actually performs the settling of accounts between banks. </p>

","<p>Brokers are supposed to (by law) only advise you or suggest to you to make trades that are in your best interest.

<p>If a trade was to go wrong, and it could be shown that the broker did something that was in their interest and not the clients, then the client could potentially have recourse.  (for example, if the broker traded in penny stocks when the client had expressed that they were highly risk adverse and it was of primary interest for them to preserve their capital.) </p>

<p>That line is the broker's way of protecting themselves from you coming back later and claiming that ""they said for me to get into xyz corp and it was not appropriate and now it's tanked and I have lost everything wha wah wahhhhh""  It's saying that they did not approach you and 'solicit' you to do this trade, that you ordered it on your own, and on your own head be it if it later turns out to not be the right thing for you or goes south in any way. </p>

"What happens to my savings if my country defaults or restructures its debt?","17953","","<p>I live in a eurozone country that a lot of people think will soon default or restructure its debt. My family has a savings account in a bank here. A <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/4626"">similar question</a> has been asked before, but it isn't quite the same thing.</p>

<p><strong>First, what are the dangers to our savings if the country defaults or restructures its debts?</strong> Is it possible to lose everything? Will the banks close down? Will the money be devalued? Is it possible that the government will take some of it?</p>

<p><strong>Second, what can one do to avert these risks?</strong> Is moving the money to a bank in a different country a good idea? What are the rates for that? How about exchanging it to a different currency? Is investing in real estate or something else financially sound or would that run the same or bigger risks?</p>
","<p>In theory, anything can happen, and the world could end tomorrow.  However, with a reasonably sane financial plan you should be able to ride this out.</p>

<p>If the government cannot or won't immediately pay its debt in full, the most immediate consequence is that people are going to be unwilling to lend any more money in future, except at very high rates to reflect the high risk of future default.  </p>

<p>Presumably the government has got into this state by running a deficit (spending more than they collect in tax) and that is going to have to come to an abrupt end.  That means: higher taxes, public service retrenchments and restrictions of service, perhaps cuts to social benefits, etc.</p>

<p>Countries that get into this state typically also have banks that have lent too much money to risky customers.  So you should also expect to see some banks get into trouble, which may mean customers who have money on deposit will have trouble getting it back.  In many cases governments will guarantee deposits, but perhaps only up to a particular ceiling like $100k.</p>

<p>It would be very possible to lose everything if you have speculative investments geared by substantial loans.  If you have zero or moderate debt, your net wealth may decrease substantially (50%?) but there should be little prospect of it going to zero.</p>

<p>It is possible governments will simply confiscate your property, but I think in a first-world EU country this is fairly unlikely to happen to bank accounts, houses, shares, etc.</p>

<p>Typically, a default has led to a fall in the value of the country's currency.  In the eurozone that is more complex because the same currency is used by countries that are doing fairly well, and because there is also turbulence in other major currency regions (JPY, USD and GBP).  In some ways this makes the adjustment harder, because debts can't be inflated down.</p>

<p>All of this obviously causes a lot of economic turbulence so you can expect house prices to fall, share prices to gyrate, unemployment to rise.  If you can afford it and come stomach the risk, it <em>may</em> turn out to be a good time to buy assets for the long term.   If you're reasonably young the largest impact on you won't be losing your current savings, but rather the impact on your future job prospects from this adjustment period.</p>

<p>You never know, but I don't think the Weimar Republic wheelbarrows-of-banknotes situation is likely to recur; people are at least a bit smarter now and there is an inflation-targeting independent central bank.</p>

<p>I think gold can have some room in a portfolio, but now is not the time to make a sudden drastic move into it.  Most middle class people cannot afford to have enough gold to support them for the rest of their life, though they may have enough for a rainy day or to act as a balancing component.</p>

<p>So what I would do to cope with this is: be well diversified, be sufficiently conservatively positioned that I would sleep at night, and beyond that just ride it out and try not to worry too much.</p>

<ul>
<li>Don't have all your cash savings in a single bank.</li>
<li>Consider putting some money into a managed fund or ETF that invests outside of your country.  This is easier to set up than a foreign bank account (ymmv) and diversifies against currency and local market risk.</li>
<li>Live within your means.</li>
<li>Keep your savings well diversified across location (home/abroad), asset class (cash/bonds/shares/property/gold), and institution.</li>

"Tenant wants to pay rent with EFT","17920","","<p>I live in Kentucky, USA. I rent out a house in Alabama, USA. My tenant wants to pay rent using electronic funds transfer rather than by mailing a check. This makes it easier for him to get my payment on time and it also comforts his fear of the check getting lost in the mail.</p>

<p>My understanding is that I must supply him with a routing and account number in order for him to electronically transfer the funds from his bank to mine. I am cautious about this but I couldn't find anything that explained why this might be dangerous to me.  I even called my bank to find out if there is a more secure means of transferring funds and they advised me that someone would be able to make <em>withdrawals</em> from my account as well as deposits. That did not help ease my concern.</p>

<p>My plan is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Send my tenant the routing and account number for the checking account that I use solely for automatic withdrawals to a financial planner, some utilities, etc. It has, on average, about $300 in it.</li>
<li>Monitor the account as closely as I do all my finances - I keep track of everything to the penny - and watch for any abnormalities.</li>
<li>As a backup, rely on my bank as they stated that any abnormal withdrawals from an account will get flagged and held until they can confirm with me.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>My question is, in general, is this a safe plan?
In particular, I have these thoughts:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>How can someone use the account number to withdraw money without my consent?</strong> (I'm satisfied with the reassurance that my plan is safe but this is the question I still can't figure out.)</li>
<li>I have 1 savings and 3 checking accounts with the same bank. Would they be able to gain access to the other accounts?</li>
<li>Is there a more secure and still free option that I have overlooked?</li>
</ul>
","<p>Yes, it is safe, we have been doing it for years. We prefer our tenants to make their rent payments in this manner. In fact, we prefer that they set up an automatic payment for the rent, either through their online banking or through their bank directly.</p>

<p>Apart from getting your rent on time, this method also has the added benefit of both parties having their own records of rent payments through their bank statements, in case there is a dispute about the rent sometime down the track.</p>

<p>Having a separate bank account just for the rent does make sense as well, it makes it easier for you to check if rent has come in, it makes it easier if you need to compare your statement without having to highlight all the rent payments amongst all other payments (you might not want to show your other incomes and spending habits to others), and you can withdraw the rents to your other account (which might offer higher interest) after it has come in, leaving a small balance most of the time in your rent account.</p>

"What does it mean to run my debit card as credit?","17772","","<p>I've been advised to (and have been) running my normal debit card transactions as ""credit"" transactions.  What does this mean in terms of my security, the time a charge takes to settle, and the fees for the vendor?</p>
","<p>A ""credit"" transaction runs through Visa/Mastercard. The transaction settlement varies by merchant and the merchant pays a 2-4% fee, depending on their arrangement with the processor and your card. You are covered by the various insurance, consumer protection and other programs associated with your card.</p>

<p>A ""debit"" transaction is secured using your PIN and settles immediately. The cost to the merchant is typically $0.10-0.50 per transaction. You are not covered by benefits provided by Visa/Mastercard and have minimal fraud protection if your PIN is compromised.</p>

<p>In terms of security, debit is probably the most secure option, as it is PIN-secured. But... credit transactions limit your liability to $50 by law, and some issuers have $0 liability policies. The catch there is that it is up to you to detect and report fraudulent transactions in a timely manner.</p>

<p>I've always been puzzled by folks who use a debit card in credit mode. Other than exposing you to more risk and imposing some self-control on you, I can't see a reason to use a debit card in credit mode over a credit card.</p>

"How can banks afford to offer credit card rewards?","17768","","<p>I understand Visa and MasterCard make money on transaction fees, but how much (if any) of those fees do banks see? Do banks make money on people who pay their bills on time, or are reward programs paid for by the people who don't?</p>
","<p>There are 3 entities in a credit card transaction;</p>

<ul>
<li>The Merchant Bank/Acquiring bank that provides the POS to the Merchant where you buy / swipe your card. This bank is the one that acquires the funds at the end of transaction.</li>
<li>The Card Network [Visa/Master/etc]</li>
<li>The Issuing Bank [the Bank that issues you a credit card]</li>
</ul>

<p>Typically when you swipe for 100, the merchant only gets around 97.5.
The 2.5 is divided amongst the 3 entities, roughly around 0.5 for the Merchant Bank, around 0.5 for the Card Network and a lions share to Issuing Bank of around 1.5</p>

<p>The reason Issuing Bank gets large share is because they take the risk and provide the credit to customer. Typically the Issuing Bank would pay the Merchant bank via the Card Network the money in couple of days. So the Merchant Bank is not out of funds.</p>

<p>The Issuing Bank on the other hand would have given you a credit of say 10 to 50 days depending on when you made the transaction and when the payment is due. On an average 30 days of credit. So roughly the Acquiring Bank is lending money at the rate of 18%.</p>

<p>It is from this money the Issuing Bank would give out rewards, which is typically less than 1%.</p>

<p>Also in cases where say Merchant Bank and the Issuing Bank are same, Bank would make money on both the legs of transaction and hence launch co-branded cards with better rewards.</p>

<p>The above numbers are illustrative and actual practices vary from Bank to Bank to card Network to Country</p>

","<p>I don't believe they're right. For international wire transfers you'd need either IBAN or SWIFT codes. I don't think any US bank participates in the IBAN network (mostly Europe and the Far East), so SWIFT is they way to go with the US.</p>

<p>Credit unions frequently don't know what and how to do with international transactions because they don't have them that often. Some don't even have SWIFT codes of their own (many, in fact) and use intermediaries to receive money.</p>

"How to share income after marriage and kids?","17592","","<p>My girlfriend and I are thinking about marriage and having children and I have spent the last days trying to figure out concepts how to handle finances from that point forward. I believe that this is relevant to most people in such a situation not only for us personally. </p>

<p>Our situation is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>I make about 3200€ net per month (45h) and my girlfriend makes
2200€ net per month (38,5h). She has a Master's in Biology, I have a
PhD in Computer Science. </li>
<li>Currently we split all common costs in
half (rent, food, gas etc.). </li>
<li>Each of us spends about 1200-1400€ per
month (including the aforementioned common costs). </li>
<li>Each child will
cost about 300€ per month (considering that we also get
""Kindergeld"").</li>
<li>After parental leave my girlfriend will likely work
part time, making about 1100€ (so not even covering her own costs),
while will make 3800€ due to different taxation. </li>
<li>Both of us feel very strongly about being financially independent and if possible we
both don't want to take money from each other. </li>
<li>The ultimate goal
for both of us is to work full time, but surely this will not be
possible at first.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now I have been trying to figure out how to split the money that we both earn. From what I can see there are several concepts but none of them really seems ideal to me.</p>

<ol>
<li>Determine the income ratio (currently 1.73, later 3.2) and pay bills according to this ratio. (She will pay less but also have much less money left over for savings.)</li>
<li>Put all the money in a big pot, pay the bills, and split the rest. (I would basically be giving her more money than necessary to pay the bills. Seems kind of unfair since I have invested a lot more time and money in my education and also have a more stressful job.) </li>
<li>I pay all running costs and she gets to keep whatever she makes. (Unfair because she would actually have much more money left over than me.)</li>
<li>Determine the income ratio before kinds with respect to the same hours (i.e. what would each if make if we worked 40h). Then distribute the income after kids so that this ratio is kept and a) pay bills 50:50 or b) pay bills according to resulting ratio (about 60:40). This seems to be the fairest in my opinion but it drastically lowers the motivation for both of us the increase our own income, while it increases the motivation for each of us to have the partner’s income increased. So this could lead to conflicts.</li>
<li>Pay everything 50:50. (Not possible due to low income in part time.)</li>
<li>We both pay for our own costs and split the costs for the children according to the ratio. (Not possible due to low part time income.)</li>
</ol>

<p>So my question is: Are there any guides or studies on how to proceed in such a situation? I am well aware that there are different opinions on this subject but I am interested in actual concepts and also studies on how such concepts work out in the real world.</p>

<p>Edit: We are living in Germany, so we can get a combined of 14 months ""paid"" parental leave (""paid"" because only a fraction of the actual income is paid). Each month she would receive about 1450€ and I would get 1800€. The cost for child care varies greatly, so I have no good estimate for that yet.</p>
","<p>My suggestion would be that you're looking at this the wrong way, though for good reasons.  Once you are a family, you should - and, in most cases I've seen, will - think of things differently than you do now.</p>

<p>Right now, your post above is written from a selfish perspective.  Not to be insulting, and not implying selfish is a <em>bad</em> thing - I don't mean it negatively.  But it is how you're defining this problem: from a self-interested, selfish point of view.  ""Fair"" and ""unfair"" only have meaning from this point of view; something can only be unfair to you if you come from a self-centered viewpoint.</p>

<p>Try to think of this from a family-centric viewpoint, and from your significant other's point of view. You're absolutely right to want both of you to be independent financially as far as is possible; but think about what that means from all three points of view (your family's, yours, and hers)?</p>

<p>Exactly what it means will depend on the two of you separately and together, but I would encourage you to start with a few basics that make it likely you'll find a common ground:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>First of all, ensure your significant other has a retirement account of her own that is funded as well as yours is.  This will both make life easier if you split up, and give her a safety net if something happens to you than if you have all of the retirement savings.  I don't know how your country manages pensions or retirement accounts, but figure out how to get her into something that is as close to equal to yours as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure both of you have similar quality credit histories.  You should both have credit cards in your own names (or be true joint owners of the accounts, not just authorized users, where that is possible), and both be on the mortgage/etc. when possible.  This is a common issue for women whose spouse dies young and who have no credit history.  (Thanks @KateGregory for reminding me on this one)</p></li>
<li><p>Beyond that, work out how much your budget allows for in spending money for the two of you, and split that equally.  This spending money (i.e., ""fun money"" or money you can do whatever you like with) is what is fundamentally important in terms of financial independence: if you control most of the extra money, then you're the one who ultimately has control over much (vacations, eating out, etc.) and things will be strained.  This money should be equal - whether it is literally apportioned directly (each of you has 200 a month in an account) or simply budgeted for with a common account is up to you, whatever works best for your personal habits; separate accounts works well for many here to keep things honest.</p></li>
<li><p>When that money is accounted for, whatever it is, split the rest of the bills up so that she pays some of them from her income.  If she wants to be independent, some of that is being in the habit of paying bills on time.  One of you paying all of the bills is not optimal since it means the other will not build good habits.  For example, my wife pays the warehouse club credit card and the cell phone bill, while I pay the gas/electric utilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Whatever doesn't go to spending money and doesn't go to the bills she's personally responsible for or you're responsible for (from your paycheck) should go to a joint account.  That joint account should pay the larger bills - mortgage/rent, in particular - and common household expenses, and both of you should have visibility on it.  For example, our mortgage, day-care costs, major credit card (which includes most of our groceries and other household expenses) come from that joint account.</p></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>This kind of system, where you each have equal money to spend and each have some household responsibilities, seems the most reasonable to me: it incurs the least friction over money, assuming everyone sticks to their budgeted amounts, and prevents one party from being able to hold power over another. It's a system that seems likely to be best for the family as a unit.  It's not ""fair"" from a self-centered point of view, but is quite fair from a family-centered point of view, and that is the right point of view when you are a family, in my opinion.</p>

<p>I'll emphasize here also that it is important that no one party hold the power, and this is set up to avoid that, but it's also important that you not use your earning power as a major arguing point in this system.  You're not ""funding her lifestyle"" or anything like that: you're supporting your family, just as she is.  If she were earning more than you, would you cut your hours and stay at home? </p>

<p>Trick question, as it happens; regardless of your answer to that question, you're still at the same point: both of you are doing the thing you're best suited for (or, the thing you prefer).  You're both supporting the family, just in different ways, and suggesting that your contribution is more valuable than hers is a great way to head down the road to divorce: it's also just plain incorrect.  My wife and I are in almost the identical situation - 2 kids, she works part time in the biological sciences while spending plenty of time with the kids, I'm a programmer outearning her significantly - and I can tell you that I'd more than happily switch roles if she were the bread earner, and would feel just as satisfied if not more doing so. And, I can imagine myself in that position, so I can also imagine how I'd feel in that position as far as how I value my contribution.</p>

"How long to wait before refinancing a high interest car loan, after improving credit history?","17591","","<p>I had no choice but to finance a car loan at a pretty disgusting rate (14%) thanks to ""insufficient credit history"" back in the end of September. My credit score was good.</p>

<p>How long should I wait before attempting to refinance into a lower interest rate on my car loan? How much history will be sufficient?</p>
","<p>Between half a year and a year should be enough to improve your interest rates drastically on car loan refinance. Make sure that your new credit card has already been reported to the agencies, and that the credit/debt ratio is lower than 30% on your revolving (credit card) accounts. That also means that you shouldn't carry too much balance, even if the APR is 0%.</p>

"Is the warranty on an engagement ring worth it","17553","","<p>Many jewelery stores around here offer a warranty on ring purchases.  For example a $2000 ring  might cost $250.  The deals offer free repair, cleaning, maintenance and sometimes replacement and vary a little in cost and coverage, but they are mostly the same.</p>

<p>Is it a good deal, or is it like a warranty on anything else?</p>
","<p>It depends on the specific terms of the warranty, and the price.  It also depends on what your homeowner's or renter's insurance covers.</p>

<p>My mother-in-law is a jeweler.  (Works for a local higher-end store, not a chain.)  Prior to dating my wife-to-be, I knew very little about jewelery.  Some major things I have learned in the ~8 years we have been together:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It is amazing how much nicer jewelery looks when it is cleaned.  Especially if you can take it to the store and have them use steam and the sonic bath.</p></li>
<li><p>Jewelry is surprisingly fragile, and rings get a lot of abuse.  You bump your hands into things a lot more than you realize.  If your diamond is in a setting where it is high up from the band, with thin delicate prongs, it can get whacked loose pretty easily.</p></li>
<li><p>Look at the ring under a loupe.  There can be a lot of cracks in the metal that are invisible to the naked eye, but are problems waiting to happen (diamond falls out and is lost).  I was shocked at the details you see under a loupe that you would miss normally.</p></li>
<li><p>Cleaning is necessary to easily see those cracks.</p></li>
<li><p>Take it to the store and get it cleaned and checked by a jeweler at least once a year.  My MIL's store would do this for free for most customers.  Other places may charge a nominal fee.</p></li>
<li><p>If you notice a stone that is loose/shifted, or you notice one of the prongs looks funny, stop wearing it immediately!  Take it back to the store for a repair.  A good jewelery store will have an in-house goldsmith that can handle minor repairs.  Major ones might have to be sent out to a specialist.  Unless a stone is missing and has to be replaced, most repairs will be &lt; $100.</p></li>
<li><p>Unless your ring has a fragile design, or you are really abusive, the above should keep it intact for many years to come.  My wife's has had here ring for ~5 years now, and she has had it repaired 2-3 times.  She has a job that involves a lot of physical violence though.</p></li>
<li><p>Homeowner's or renter's insurance will usually cover the jewelry, but items above a certain value will need to be documented and on file with the insurance company.  You will probably need a recent appraisal of the item (get one when you buy it).</p></li>
<li><p>Ask your insurance agent what kinds of events are covered (ring stolen, ring lost in a fire, ring mysteriously disappears, etc).  Make sure you fully understand the limitations, and if there are any options for specialized extended coverage.</p></li>
<li><p>Find out what the optional warranty from the store covers.  Overlapping coverage with homeowners insurance is pointless.  However, if the store normally charges for cleanings, but the extended warranty gets you them for free, it might be worth it.</p></li>
<li><p>Seriously, make sure someone looks it over with a loupe at least once a year.</p></li>

<p>The difference between a portfolio manager and a trader (where exists) is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Portfolio manager's job is to decide on the best contents (holdings) in the portfolio that would accomplish the portfolio's stated objective within stated constraints (e.g. make the best possible return while keeping the risk under a specified level).</p></li>
<li><p>Trader's job <strong>at a buy-side</strong> institution is to basically execute the trades necessary to change the portfolio holdings from their current state to whatever state portfolio managers decided to achieve. </p>

<p><em><strong>As a matter of fact, at some smaller buy-side firms (especially fixed income), there ARE no separate trader positions, and portfolio managers do both jobs.</em></strong></p>

<p>A trader's job is to execute the required trades so that the transaction costs are minimized and the PnL is maximized by buying as low as possible and selling as high as possible (e.g. for a simple example dumping a large chunk of a certain stock all at once would depress the stock price so you would make less money as your average sell price goes down).</p></li>
<li><p>Trader's job <strong>at a sell-side</strong> institution is more involved, as the trader is also responsible for making money for the firm via his trades, e.g. he may trade securities specifically for the purpose of making the money off the trade as opposed to the purpose of achieving desired portfolio composition. </p></li>

If neither party files an amended return, a second letter from the IRS will ask for proof, which you should respond to immediately with a copy of the court order.</p>

It seems that all they can do is either <em>mail</em> him the check, or I can go to the bank and deposit it.</p>

<p>I would like to understand why transferring money in the United States is so difficult. Is there a reasonable explanation?</p>
","<p>While the US hosts most of the world's innovative startups, its own financial and banking systems are very slow to change. </p>

<p>The infrastructure exists, however the ACH transfers are not wide-spread between individuals. Banks much prefer the option of bill-pay (i.e.: as you said, <em>mailing a check</em>, something in other countries people wouldn't even think of), than letting you do it yourself. </p>

<p>Why? Because they can. There's no real competition over consumers, and the consumers themselves are not educated or sophisticated. Thus, the banks are comfortable with the lack of innovation - since as long as they are <strong>all</strong> lacking innovation - consumers won't demand it because they won't even know things are possible. And it is definitely cheaper for the banks not to innovate and keep your money for a week while the bill-pay check is en route, than try and develop new things.</p>

<p>In other countries, the regulator would step up and force banks to develop new infrastructure and widen the options, but in the US regulation is considered a bad thing, and people are easily swayed, being uneducated and uninformed, by the corporations to support politicians who act against their (people's) best interest in protecting the corporations and reducing and limiting the regulators even further.</p>

<p>If you make this emergency purchase and another emergency comes up, you can always (if necessary) borrow the money at that time.  It doesn't make sense to borrow money before you need it.</p>

<p>That having been said, I would encourage you to build up your emergency fund so that you have enough money in there to handle things like this without completely depleting your savings account.  3 to 6 months of expenses is the general recommendation for your emergency fund.  Then if something unplanned comes up, you'll have the money in the bank without having to borrow and pay interest.</p>

However I am a Muslim and cannot participate in anything involving interest. I also learned that keeping money in terms of just cash is the worst form since there is inflation etc. I would like to know what can I do to become rich. Please suggest. Thanks.</p>
","<p>There are many Shariah compliant investments, so that could direct your resulting searches. Shariah compliance is a very strict interpretation of Islam and for investing offers strict guidelines in what to invest in and excludes investments in companies that engage in certain businesses such as gambling, tobacco, pork and trading of gold and silver on a deferred basis (and more). Many multinational financial service companies such as the Standard &amp; Poors (S&amp;P) offer Shariah Compliant funds and indices, as such, it makes it easier to invest in a variety of different assets through them. You can also look at their fund's constituents and invest in those assets directly.</p>

<p>Secondly, going back to your original question about a compound interest equivalent, you can look at the products offered by Shariah Compliant banks.</p>

<p>Now, if it is really important for you to adhere to the strictest interpretations of your faith, you should know that most Islamic Banks have interest bearing assets within them and that they disguise that fact. The global financial system is based on interest bearing instruments such as bonds, and Islamic banks are large holders and issuers of those instruments, and all of their consumer products are also based on the interest rates of them. Even convoluted alternatives such as Islamic mortgages, where they are advertised as non-interest bearing equivalents, many times are also the interest bearing version. Unfortunately, these lies are enough for the banks to continue to get business from their target audiences, but outside of Islam this is a very standard and stable business practice.</p>

<p>The point is that you should look very carefully at the alternatives you find.</p>

<p>From what I can tell, yes, the site you originally linked to (which I removed) appears to be in the United States and therefore likely intended for U.S. cardholders only.  Your profile indicates you are in the U.K.  <strong>Most banks and credit card companies do maintain separate systems per country, for legal reasons.</strong></p>

<p>Anyway, <strong>for your own security</strong> I suggest you contact your card issuer's support telephone number and request the correct U.K. cardholder web site address from them directly.</p>

<p><strong>In general,</strong> you don't want to be guessing or searching for the web site address for your credit card company or bank's online self-service application.  There are often ""impostor"" web sites out there that just want your credit card number!</p>

<p>Instead, you should obtain the web site addresses for your financial services from <strong>trusted</strong> sources only; i.e. direct from your bank or card issuer, such as on your printed statement, or through their help line, or linked-to from their known-good home page.</p>

"How should a new investor allocate funds in a Roth IRA?","17090","","<p>I started a Roth IRA a little while ago, contributing ~$5,000, and I'd like some guidelines on how I should diversify my investments.  Should I invest in stocks or bonds or mutual funds or ETF? What percent should I contribute to these investments?  Additionally, I'm 30 years old, how might my age factor into diversification?</p>

<p>I understand that this is a very subjective question but any suggestions are greatly appreciated.</p>
","<p>If you have just <em>started</em> an IRA (presumably with a contribution for 2012), 
you likely have $5000 in it, or $10,000 if you made a full contribution for 
2013 as well. At this time, I would recommend putting it <strong>all</strong> in a 
<strong>single</strong> low-cost mutual fund. Typically, mutual funds that track an
<em>index</em> such as the S&amp;P 500 Index have lower costs (annual expense fees)
than actively managed funds, and most investment companies offer such
mutual funds, with Fidelity, Vanguard, Schwab, to name a few, having
<em>very</em> low expenses even among index funds.
Later, when you have more money in the account, you can consider
diversifying into more funds, buying stocks and bonds, investing in
ETFs, etc.</p>

<p>Incidentally, if you are just starting out and your Roth IRA is
essentially your first investment experience, be aware that
you <strong>do not</strong> need a brokerage account for your
Roth IRA until you have more money in the account to invest and
specifically want to buy individual stocks and bonds instead of
just mutual funds. If
you opened a brokerage account for your Roth IRA, <em>close</em> it and 
<em>transfer</em> the Roth IRA to your choice of mutual fund company; else
you will be paying annual fees to the brokerage for maintaining your
account, inactivity fees since you won't be doing any trading, etc.
The easiest way to do this is to go to the mutual fund company
web site and tell them that you want to <em>transfer</em> your IRA to
them (<strong>not</strong> roll over your IRA to them)
and they will take care of all the paper work and collecting your
money from the brokerage (ditto if your Roth IRA is with a bank
or another mutual fund company). Then close your brokerage account.</p>

I have just begun employment at this company and my age is in the lower 20s. Since I just started out and I am single with no dependents (for at least 2 more years), it seems like I have more money on hand than I will have in the future. What approximate percentage of pay should I invest?</p>

<p>EDIT: I am referring to ESPP, the company is in the US, is publicly traded and the stock is known for being quite stable.</p>
","<p>You're talking about ESPP? For ESPP it makes sense to utilize the most the company allows, i.e.: in your case - 15% of the paycheck (if you can afford deferring that much, I assume you can). When the stocks are purchased, I would sell them immediately, not hold. This way you have ~10% premium as your income (pretty much guaranteed, unless the stock falls significantly on the very same day), and almost no exposure. This sums up to be a nice 1.5% yearly guaranteed bonus, on top of any other compensation.</p>

<p>As to keeping the stocks, this depends on how much you believe in your company and expect the stocks to appreciate. Being employed and dependent on the company with your salary, I'd avoid investing in your company, as you're invested in it deeply as it is.</p>

"Selling online - Is private transportation indicative of a scam? Does PayPal make it safe?","16999","","<p>I'm in the process of selling some furniture online. </p>

<p>I use a website called <a href=""http://dba.dk"" rel=""noreferrer"">dba.dk</a>, which is the Danish equivalent of eBay (it was actually bought by eBay some years ago). The website is mainstream (almost all Danes use it from time to time) but is also known for being used by scammers, mostly from foreign countries. </p>

<p>I received a message regarding one of the items I'm selling: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hello,</p>
  
  <p>It is my pleasure to read from you once again. In regards to your
  email, i am ok with the price and the condition of the furniture as

<p>Any input is much appreciated.</p>
","<p>The way this one works is interesting, and there's a variant of it in the 'states as well:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You receive more money than you're asking for with this item. They ask you to pay their private transport using the 'extra' money they sent you, and maybe even leave a little extra for you for your troubles. </p>
  
  <p>After you send the payment to their 'private transport', a separate entity, the transaction they sent you reverses, even though your transaction to this private transport does not.</p>
  
  <p>It's as if you just paid some random person X amount of your own money. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's not about the item you're selling. They don't care about it or what the cost is.</p>

<p>The entirety of the scam is getting you to forward some money that doesn't exist (and therefore is covered with your own) to the scammer.</p>

<p>The key to this scam to look out for is there's almost always a 'shipper' or in your case 'private transport' or other separate party that needs to be paid to complete the transaction. There's no legitimate situation where they'd need to send payment to you and have you forward it to someone else, yet most of the time when you get a message like the above, and respond to it, you'll find some barely-reasonable explanation of why a situation like that is going to be necessary.</p>

<p>The first email you receive from a scammer in this kind of situation is fairly hard to identify. </p>

<p>I had a similar one a while ago, but the scammer actually posted an ad claiming to be selling an RV at a too-good-to-be-true price to lure in contacts for the scam.</p>

<p>There's arguably hundreds of variations on this scam, anything from buying/selling an item to being overpaid with a fake cashier's check / money order, etc. </p>

<p>I've had family members actually receive cashier's checks addressed to them in the mail, and followup letters demanding they send a portion of it back, as it was a 'mistake'. The base thing you're looking for in a scam, like this or otherwise, is how they're paying you and whether at some point they try to get you to send money somewhere else. </p>

","<p>Wisegeeks are explaining it well, Investopedia are mentioning it briefly. The difference is in the accounting treatment.</p>

<pre><code>Earnings = revenue - production costs.

Profits = total revenue - total expenses.
</code></pre>

<p>The difference is hard to notice, but significant: for example if your company is making ice cream, then the earnings would be the revenue from selling ice cream minus all the costs to produce ice cream (including materials, salary, equipment, transportation, etc).</p>

<p>But the profits would also include other revenue (for example - interest on cash in the bank), reduced by other expenses (for example, the CEO's vacation with the mistress to Argentina).</p>

<p>Large difference between earnings and profits may suggest that the company spends a lot of money on unrelated activities (for negative difference) or has a lot of unrelated income (for positive difference).</p>

<p>Differences in accounting methods (for example GAAP vs IFRS) may also contribute to the difference between the revenue and the profits.</p>

"Paying a Navient Loan's Principal","16951","","<p>I have the following loans:</p>

<p>A) $12,818 @ 9.25%</p>

<p>B) $11,499 @ 2.25%</p>

<p>C) $10,059 @ 2.25%</p>

<p>D) $ 3,365 @ 10%</p>

<p>I recently received a $5000 inheritance so I would like to allocate this in the best way possible. It seems to me it is best to put it all towards loan A. Although it does not have the highest interest rate, it has a much higher balance than loan D, so it should be accruing more interest anyway, correct?</p>

<p>Now, when I go to Navient's website to repay it and make more than the minimum it says the following: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you pay more than your Total Payment Amount, the extra funds will be applied to your balance. Unless you make your payments through auto debit, extra payments will reduce the amount of any future payments. For example, if you pay an extra $50 and your regular monthly payment amount is $100, your next payment due will be $50. If the extra funds are more than the next monthly payment(s), your billing statement(s) will show zero due. Even if you have a zero amount due on your billing statement, continuing to make payments will reduce your total costs of borrowing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I want to pay 100% of the excess payment towards the principal, NOT to future loan payments. I would rather have to continue making my monthly payments towards a principal that has been reduced by my one lump sum payment. I don't want credit towards them because then aren't I paying interest on a higher principal?</p>

<p>Furthermore I want to be able to do this without signing up for auto-pay. I don't ever want anyone to automatically bill my account.</p>

<p>Does anybody have any experience with Navient and know how to do this? I already called them and they seemed to talk in circles saying ""It will go towards your future payments, that's just how the system works"" Don't I have the right to allocate my payment however I want provided I meet the minimum payments? I want to be billed each month for interest calculated off of a principal that I have reduced with my $5000.</p>
","<p>Based on their <a href=""https://www.navient.com/loan-customers/how-payments-works/loan-payment-allocation/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">website</a>, it's fairly clear that they will apply the overpayment to the principal.  When they say they will reduce future payments, what they mean is that they'll reduce your <em>obligation</em> to make future payments - so if you pay 2x the current payment, you wouldn't be 'past due' if you miss the next payment.  You still reduce your principal by the full amount.</p>

<p>See this image:
<img src=""https://www.navient.com/assets/loan-customers/how-payments-work/FFELP-Multiple-Current.png""></p>

<p>The second section is what you're planning to do.</p>

<p>If you want to be entirely clear, I suggest mailing a check (not doing this online) and including on the piece of paper exactly how you want the money distributed.  Since you want to reduce a specific loan, then you need to say exactly what portion of the money goes to that loan.</p>

<p>You are incorrect, by the way, in suggesting to reduce the 9.25% interest rate first; you should pay off the 10% rate first in its entirety.  Yes, the 9.25% loan will generate in total more interest, but the same $3500 will generate more overall savings in the 10% loan.  Always pay off highest rate first, no matter how small the actual amount is.</p>

<p>To give this a visual persepctive, you can imagine your debt as one continuous bar like so: <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/skbfF.png"" alt=""interest rate graph""></p>

<p>Basically, you owe a total of $38k or so, and the highest $3500 or so is at 10%, the next 12k or so is at 9.25%, and the next 22.5k is at 2.25%.  You want to pay from the top down where possible, because the higher on that bar the more interest it's generating.  Lop off that green bit and a bit of the red bit, and you'll be better off than solely taking 5k of the red out.</p>

<p>She said she had not done that much of that ""mystery shopper"" work that she would have expected to receive anything close to the amount on this check.</p>

<p>She was asking me about it but I thought that if she does not know the sender, perhaps this could be some kind of new scam and she should check with the local police (which she said she was going to do).</p>

<p>Anyway I wanted to ask here if anyone knows of a scam like this? Considering that the check here seems to be a ""cashiers check"", how would a scam like this even work?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I just found out that there was indeed a letter included with the check (and it seems to have instructions similar to those mentioned in the answer by ""BrenBarn""). This is indeed related to that ""mystery shopper"" work.

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/U4J7s.jpg""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/U4J7s.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>
","<p>It is likely a scam.  In fact the whole mystery shopping ""job"" may be a scam.  There is <a href=""http://www.snopes.com/fraud/sales/cashier.asp"">a Snopes page</a> about cashier's check scams, as well as <a href=""http://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/consumer-advisories/2007/consumer-advisory-2007-1.html"">a US government page</a> which specifically mentions mystery shopping as a scam angle.</p>

<p>As for how the scam works, from the occ.gov site I just linked:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, cashier’s checks lately have become an attractive vehicle for fraud when used for payments to consumers. Although, the amount of a cashier’s check quickly becomes ""available"" for withdrawal by the consumer after the consumer deposits the check, these funds do not belong to the consumer if the check proves to be fraudulent. It may take weeks to discover that a cashier’s check is fraudulent. In the meantime, the consumer may have irrevocably wired the funds to a scam artist or otherwise used the funds—only to find out later, when the fraud is detected—that the consumer owes the bank the full amount of the cashier’s check that had been deposited.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is somewhat unusual in that, from what you say, there has been no attempt thus far to get money back.  However, your sister-in-law may have received that info separately, or received it as part of her mystery shopping job but didn't mention it to you with regard to this check.  Typically the scam involves telling the recipient to transfer money to a third party (e.g., by buying goods as a mystery shopper, or via wire transfer to ""reimburse"" someone associated with a sham operation).  By the time the cashier's check is revealed as fraudulent, the victim has already transferred away his/her own real money.</p>

<p>It's probably worth taking the check to your or her bank and asking them about it.  They may have more info.  Also, banks usually want to know about scams like this because, in the long run, they accumulate data on them and share that with law enforcement and can eventually catch some of the scammers.</p>

<p>Edit: Just to help anyone who may be reading this later.  The letter you added confirms it is absolutely a scam.  My boss was once contacted via a scam operation very similar to this.  The huge red flag (in addition to others already mentioned) is that you are being ""given"" a check for over $2000, of which only $25 is purportedly for actual mystery shopping and $285 is payment for you, the mystery shopper.  The whole rest of the $2000+ amount is for you to wire to ""another Mystery/Secret Shopper in order for them to complete their assignment"".  They are giving you $2000 to give to someone else who is supposedly another one of their own employees/contractors.  Ask yourself what sane business would conduct their operations in this way.  If you work at a law office, or a hamburger stand, or a school, or anything you like, does your boss ever say ""Here is your paycheck for $5000.  I know you only earned $1000, but I'm just going to give you the whole $5000, and you're supposed to use $4000 of it to pay your coworker Joe his wages.""  No.  There is no reason to do that except that the ""other mystery shopper"" is actually the scammer.</p>

<li>I've considered standing in front of the dry cleaners with a letter handout explaining the situation and warning other customers in an attempt to sway their patronage and convince the dry cleaners to pay me to get rid of me, but I'm not sure if this is legal. Is it?</li>
<li>Is it a criminal offense for them to not do anything about it?  Are they not responsible for the clothes they take to be cleaned?</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>
Just got back from the dry cleaners in one more attempt before sending my letter of demand and what do ya' know!  They had my pants.  They didn't/wouldn't explain what happened. However, despite this being resolved without any further action, it was great to learn so much about what to do in this situation.  Thanks to all who participated in the reclamation of my lost pants.  </p>
","<p>Do you have the claim ticket? I'll assume yes. Do a Google search for ""Dry Cleaner Regulations for [state you live in]"" and see if there is a regulatory agency because some states have them, although that might just be for environmental concerns. Worth a shot to call one and ask if they handle customer complaints.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the goal is to have them either find your pants or compensate you for the loss. I'd try one last time on the phone or in person. If that fails:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Send them a nastygram in the mail demanding $160 by x date or you will pursue ""further actions"". Keep the letter short and sweet. You can use Google to find example demand letters.</p></li>
<li><p>After they ignore the letter, file in small claims court. It will cost you ~$50 in filing fees which will be included in the judgement if you win.</p></li>
<li><p>Go to court, explain why you feel they owe you $160. Bring the claim ticket, the matching suit jacket, and proof that replacing it will cost $160.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Step 4: win!</p>

<p>Or if that sounds like too much work, you can just write a nasty review on Yelp. You won't get your pants back but it'll feel good. I'd avoid the complaining to the BBB because they have no teeth and the dry cleaner is not obligated to respond to a BBB complaint.</p>

<p>Standing right outside their door handing out pamphlets might be a bad idea since it's likely private property and they'll make you leave. But you could always do the labor union thing and hold a ""shame on the drycleaners for losing my pants!"" sign out by the street or entrance to the parking lot. (That seems like a lot of effort, although it'll look great on your Facebook feed!)</p>

"Why I cannot find a ""Pure Cash"" option in 401k investments?","16689","","<p>I am of an opinion that I should decide where my money should get invested and if it should get invested at all or not. </p>

<p>When I looked at the investment options I have with my 401k money, I figured out that there are many Mutual Funds that I can choose from. But I couldn't find a ""Pure Cash - No investment option"" - what I mean by this is an option where my money is kept idle without investing in any kind of financial instrument (stocks, bonds, other MFs, currencies, forex etc etc whatever). </p>

<p>I wanted such kinda option because things may turn bad and I may want nothing invested in the stock markets/bond markets. I was thinking that if the market turns bear then I would move everything to cash, but the cash option that is provided is not pure cash, it's again a fund basically which they call it as SF guaranteed. I dived in and investigated where this fund invests. It's portfolio consists of public bonds and mortgage loans and many other things. It means my money isn't getting invested as I want. There is no zero risk option! They have clearly mentioned that it has investment risk and it's not backed by any Federal fund. It's backed by the assets of the company that manages my 401k investments, duh! It's a private company. And who cares about that. I don't want any backing, I just want to keep my money in pure cash. Shouldn't I have an option to put my money into pure cash? </p>

<p>And if they aren't providing my an option why aren't they? What's there motive behind this? </p>

<p>What to do in such a scenario? My only point is I should decide where my hard earned money is invested. By giving all the options which in the end are investing in stocks/bonds/mortgage securities etc they are essentially telling me that all my 401k investment is subject to market risks! That's bad. There is no safe parking zone for turbulent times!</p>

<p>Any thoughts/advice would be greatly appreciated. </p>

<p>Thanks,
Saurabh</p>
","<p>Holding pure cash is a problem for 401K companies because they would then have follow banking rules because they would be holding your cash on their balance sheets. They don't want to be in that business. Instead, they should offer at least one option as a cash equivalent - a money market fund. This way the money is held by the fund, not by 401K administrator.</p>

<p>Money Market funds invest in ultra-short term paper, such as overnight loans between banks and other debt instruments that mature in a matter of days. So it is all extremely liquid, as close to ""Money"" as you can get without actually being money. </p>

<p>It is extremely rare for a money market fund to lose value, or ""break the buck."" During the crisis of 2008, only one or two funds broke the buck, and it didn't last long. They had gotten greedy and their short term investments were a little more aggressive as they were trying to get extra returns.</p>

<p>In short, your money is safe in a money market fund, and your 401K plan should offer one as the ""cash"" option, or at least it should offer a short-term bond fund. If you feel strongly that your money should be in actual cash, you can always stop contributing to the 401K and put the money in the bank. This is not a good idea though. Unless you're close to retirement, you'll be much better off investing in a well diversified portfolio, even through the ups and downs of the market.</p>

"How to get rid of someone else's debt collector?","16623","","<p>For the past three and a half years (as long as we've had this phone number -- a land line), we've been getting calls from debt collectors for the person who apparently used to have our number.</p>

<p>The collectors don't believe that she doesn't live here, and the only legal way to get them to stop is sending a letter. But as far as I can tell, that written request only applies to the current collector.</p>

<p>I've sent FDCPA drop dead letters, and the calls stop... for a while. Then (I'm guessing) the debt gets sold to the next agency, and the calls start again.</p>

<p>Is there any way to <strong>permanently</strong> stop the nonsense? Or do I have to simply wait until her debt expires?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: In response to stoj's answer, here's the drop-dead letter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dear XXX,</p>
  
  <p>I am notifying you in writing that your agency has contacted me regarding a debt for ZZZ. No one by that name lives at my address or phone number.</p>

 cell phone.""</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In fact, the call frequency increased
  once they realized they had reached a
  live person. I called each of these
  companies multiple times, and though I
  was given assurances each time that my
  number would be taken off of their
  lists, the calls continued, morning,
  noon and night. At my wits end, I
  decided the only way to have the
  harassing calls stop was to file suits
  against the collection companies. It's
  very important to understand that it
  is against the law for a company to
  leave a pre-recorded message on your
  cell phone. Armed with this knowledge,
  I filed suit against several of the
  collection companies. I filed in small
  claims court so I did not need to hire
  an attorney, and the process was as
  simple as completing a paragraph on a
  complaint form. For evidence, I had
  over a hundred Google Voicemail
  transcripts showing the times the
  companies called and the text of the
  pre-recorded messages.</p>
  
  <p>Mysteriously, the calls all stopped
  immediately on the same date the
  collection companies received the
  certified letters stating they were
  being sued. Then a new flurry of calls
  began pouring in. This time it was
  their attorneys.</p>
  
  <p>The attorneys representing these out
  of state collection companies were all
  desperate to settle out of court. hey
  did not want to incur the expense of
  traveling for court or hiring a local
  law firm who wasn't on retainer. They
  also understood they had no
  justifiable defense for the calls. To
  make a long story short, so far I have
  successfully sued 3 of these
  collection companies and settled for
  more than $5,000 out of court. All it
  cost me was $35 and 20 minutes per
  suit.</p>
  
  <p>Making these companies pay is the only
  incentive for them to stop their
  illegal and harassing practices. If
  more consumers knew their rights and
  actually took a few minutes to stand
  up for them, it would become less
  profitable for these companies to
  conduct business the way they do now.</p>

"How do I calculate the (likely) property taxes on a new home in a new area?","16487","","<p>I live in <strong>Texas</strong> where there is no personal state income tax, but there is a significant tax on real estate.  </p>

<p>I am considering buying a new home, built to my specifications (ehh, to an extent...) in a new neighborhood by a home builder.  </p>

<p>I have significant equity in my current house and a large cash down payment.  Thus, most of my monthly housing budget (half or more) is towards property taxes and not mortgage payments.</p>

<p>I'm having difficulty determining how much property tax I am likely to owe, and thus how much house I can afford.</p>

<p>I know:</p>

<ul>
<li>A rough estimate of property tax rate for the area, as a sum of the districts that overlap in the general vicinity, although some of the districts don't exist yet.</li>
<li>What the purchase price of the house will be</li>
<li>An estimate of what the price per square foot is for comparable houses in the area</li>
</ul>

<p>My issue is that I don't understand specifically how the property tax will be assessed.  My understanding is that the assessor will estimate the value of the house, in an attempt to determine what it would sell for in an open market where neither party was under duress.  I believe they tend to estimate this using the square footage of the property, times the going rate of dollars per square foot.  </p>

<p>When I've bought houses in the past, I've overrode the assessor's valuation by bringing documentation from the sale.  Since they're estimating a potential sale, and such a sale actually occurred, they're generally willing to adjust their valuation based on the sale information.</p>

<p>This would lead me to believe that the property tax valuation of the home <em>should</em> be the amount I pay the builder.  However, it seems like I could ""game"" this system somewhat.</p>

<p>For instance, say I tell the builder to put in cheap flooring and fixtures, and then I buy the house less expensively than I would before.  At some point (even before moving in), I replace the cheap items with more expensive ones.  Or I could pay out-of-pocket for ""custom"" upgrades and (builder willing) have them install stuff I bought for me.  The costs of these would (hopefully, builder willing) not show up in the purchase price of the house.  </p>

<p>The property tax assessor doesn't know about these improvements, and if they were basing their valuation on the sale price, my property taxes would be lower, right? </p>

<p>The other side of that coin is that probably I will pay a premium to have my house built ""my way.""  Like a new car, the value will decrease significantly as soon as I take ownership.  If the assessor bases the valuation on the sale price of the house, aren't I getting screwed over in terms of the actual value?  In terms of upgrade pricing, they are almost certainly charging <em>way</em> over market, but they have me over a barrel, which is probably technically ""under duress"" although I doubt anyone else sees it that way.</p>

<p>Or perhaps the assessor is going to look at the blueprint, disregard the sale price of the house, and estimate the value of the house based on the price per square foot of comparable houses in the area.  Thus, the interior of the house is irrelevant, and I might as well get whatever I want.</p>

<p>I find it difficult to determine how much house I can afford, because I can't accurately estimate these property taxes.  I could (and have) asked my Realtor, but he's a salesman with a stake in this game, and I can't implicitly trust him.  Similarly, the builders are trying to sell houses and have no responsibility to truthfully inform me about property taxes, and I doubt that's an area of expertise as well.  I've spoken to many people and gathered many data points, but I still feel like I don't have enough information.  Thus, I am seeking additional advice...</p>
","<p>The <em>assessed</em> value of a home virtually never matches the <em>market</em> value, especially for established neighborhoods (which is not your situation, I grant). It is virtually always lower, because if it's ever higher than the market value, the homeowner can hire an independent appraiser and contest the assessment, while if it's lower, the homeowner usually doesn't report the discrepancy. In Texas, there's also a law that limits the amount that the appraised value can rise (though currently it's still a very steep 10%).</p>

<p>In your situation, with a custom home being built in a new neighborhood, you probably have a Hobson's choice on the price; if that's the floorplan and these are the options you want, this is the price you'll pay, and you can take it or leave it. These prices are usually set by the homebuilder based on land value plus a price per square foot plus premium amenities, so that the average price per square foot will be relatively uniform across all houses in a development project, or at least that phase of the project. In such a case, the tax assessor's job is pretty easy; the initial purchase price of the home (which is a matter of public record in Texas) is the assessed value of the home, because they would appraise the home in much the same way it's being sold. </p>

<p>Given that value, the amount of your property taxes is the purchase price of your home minus your homestead exemption (if this is your ""primary residence"", and applicable only to school district taxes in most cases) times the sum of all applicable tax percentages. </p>

<p>You mentioned some of the authorities that would set tax rates for your home don't exist yet; that's highly unusual, as the two most common are the county and local school district. Every square foot in the State is already part of a county, and school districts aren't often created out of nothingness; the most likely scenario is that one of the nearby districts will annex your neighborhood, and this decision would have been made long before the foundation of any house was laid, because new development usually requires redrawing school attendance boundaries and often building new schools to accomodate the new neighborhood and balance attendance across schools at each level. Similarly, any existing special tax districts, usually created to fund public improvements that benefit a relatively small area, should already be set up long before you were picking out paint and flooring. All it should take is a call to the county clerk, or to the appraisal district office; give them your address, or if you know it your development's name, phase and lot number, and they'll tell you what tax districts cover you.</p>

<p>What might be true is that nobody knows the effects your development will have on the tax rates of those districts. More houses mean more total taxable value, but also more costs, so depending on the balance between those two at every level, tax rates could go up or down in response to a large residential development project. That's going to be something you'll deal with the whole time you own the home, along with fluctuations in home value. My taxes have routinely varied by $500+ every year; the first year, I didn't qualify for the homestead exemption but my lender was collecting escrow as if I were, so I ended up being short about $600. The next year the exemption kicked in but the lender was withholding at the higher rate based on the previous tax bill, so I got a $500 refund. Now, my home's assessed value has jumped by 10 grand in 2 years as the housing market has recovered in earnest, so this year's tax escrow was short by about $400 and next year's will likely be short as well.</p>

A dealer has the car I want, used (looks like it was brought back from a lease), and I'm wondering how to estimate what they have invested in it. Is there a guideline for this, or any insight that can be offered?</p>
","<p>There's no rule of thumb -- people get ripped all of the time on trade-ins or when they sell cars to the dealer.</p>

<p>I think with used car negotiations, demand for the car is more important than their cost. If you're talking a 2007 Kia, there will be lots of room. If it's a 2009 Honda, they won't even discuss price.</p>

<p>In terms of negotiations, you'll only get the best price if you're willing to walk away at most dealers. I usually pick 2-3 candidate cars at different lots and show up on the last day of the month. If it's busy, look at the wall and find the #1 salesman and be a pain in the butt. Refuse to listen to the 4-square speil and walk away slowly if he doesn't negotiate.

","<p><strong>Federal taxes are generally lower in Canada</strong>.  Canada's top federal income tax rate is 29%; the US rate is 35% and will go to 39.6% when Bush tax cuts expire.  The healthcare surcharge will kick in in a few years, pushing the top bracket by a few more points and over 40%.</p>

<p><strong>State/provincial taxes are lower in the US.</strong>  You may end up in the 12% bracket in New York City or around 10% in California or other ""bad"" income-tax states.  But Alberta is considered a tax haven in Canada and has a 10% flat tax.  Ontario's top rate is about 11%, but there are surtaxes that can push the effective rate to about 17%.</p>

<p><strong>Investment income taxes: Canada wins, narrowly.</strong>  Income from capital gains counts as half, so if you're very rich and live in Ontario, your rate is about 23% and less than that in Alberta.  The only way to match or beat this deal in the US in the long term is to live in a no-income-tax state.  Dividends are taxed at rates somewhere between capital gains and ordinary income - not as good a deal as Bush's 15% rate on preferred dividends, but that 15% rate will probably expire soon.</p>

<p><strong>Sales taxes: US wins, but the gap is closing.</strong>  Canada has a national VAT-like tax, called GST and its rate came down from 7% to 5% when Harper became the Prime Minister.  Provinces have sales taxes on top of that, in the range of 7-8% (but Alberta has no sales tax).  Some provinces ""harmonized"" their sales taxes with the GST and charge a single rate, e.g. Ontario has a harmonized sales tax (HST) of 13% (5+8).  13% is of course a worse rate than the 6-8% charged by most states, but then some states and counties already charge 10% and the rates have been going up in each recession.</p>

<p><strong>Payroll taxes: much lower in Canada.</strong>  Canadian employees' CPP and EI deductions have a low threshold and top out at about $3,000.  Americans' 7.65% FICA rate applies to even $100K, resulting in a tax of $7,650.</p>

<p><strong>Property taxes: too dependent on the location, hard to tell</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Tax benefits for retirement savings: Canada.</strong>  If you work in the US and don't have a 401(k), you get a really bad deal: your retirement is underfunded and you're stuck with a higher tax bill, because you can't get the deduction.  In Canada, if you don't have an RRSP at work, you take the money to the financial company of your choice, invest it there, and take the deduction on your taxes.  If you don't like the investment options in your 401(k), you're stuck with them.  If you don't like them in your RRSP, contribute the minimum to get the match and put the rest of the money into your individual RRSP; you still get the same deduction.  Annual 401(k) contribution limits are use-it-or-lose-it, while unused RRSP limits and deductions can be carried forward and used when you need to jump tax brackets.  Canada used to lack an answer to Roth IRAs, but the introduction of TFSAs took care of that.</p>

<p><strong>Mortgage interest deduction: US wins</strong> here as mortgage interest is not deductible in Canada.</p>

<p><strong>Marriage penalty: US wins.</strong>  Canadian tax returns are of single or married-filing-separately type.  So if you have one working spouse in the family or a big disparity between spouses' incomes, you can save money by filing a joint return.  But such option is not available in Canada (there are ways to transfer some income between spouses and fund spousal retirement accounts, but if the income disparity is big, that won't be enough).</p>

<p><strong>Higher education: cheaper in Canada.</strong> This is not a tax item, but it's a big expense for many families and something the government can do about with your tax dollars.</p>

<p><strong>To sum it up</strong>, you may face higher or lower or about the same taxes after moving from US to Canada, depending on your circumstances.  Another message here is that the high-tax, socialist, investment-unfriendly Canada is mostly a convenient myth.</p>

"Does it make sense to insure something when you could financially bear its loss?","16354","","<p>I'm wondering whether it makes sense to insure something if its loss would not be life-changing. I want to buy a boat to live on while I attend university. It would cost about 10,000 dollars and my financial situation is good enough so that I would not live on the street if it suddenly sank.</p>

<p>My father suggests I insure the boat, but I'm not sure this makes sense. Insurance companies on average make money by selling insurance, which means you lose money on average by dealing with them. Hence, insurance seems to only makes sense if you couldn't bear the loss.</p>

<p>Consider for example, Aganju's answer to a health insurance question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Insurance - in its basic idea - is supposed to protect you from exceptional and potentially life-changing financial situations; not from day-to-day cost. That means that covering the first 1000 $ is pretty much useless; for any serious sickness the insurance would be without merit. [From Aganju's answer to <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/84161/compromise-between-100-insurance-and-no-insurance-long-term-view"">this question]</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree with this.
Am I missing anything here? Why do people get boat insurance at all if they could bear the loss of their boat?</p>
","<p>Some brief research suggest that boat insurance is ~1.5% of boat cost/year. So a $10,000 boat might be about $150. Other sites say average boat insurance is $300-500/year. So a bit of a range to work with.</p>

<p>Though the risk is relatively low, people would rather a small planned expense than risk a large unplanned expense.</p>

<p>In addition, most policies cover liability, so if someone were to get hurt on your boat, or you caused damage with your boat, insurance adds protection. </p>

<p>I see a lot answers that focus on not getting these things. I'm going to tell you how to at least attempt to have your cake and eat it too.</p>

<p>If you can get these things without paying for them, or by paying pennies on the dollar for them, you'll no longer want to buy them at full price.</p>

<p>Begin by making a list of the items you can't stop thinking about. </p>

<h2>Go to the library for books, movies (DVDs), albums (CDs), and even games</h2>

<p>Go to your local library and look for relevant items that are on your list. If they are not yet available, request that the library purchase them, and reserve them for when the items come in. </p>

<p>Yes, libraries are usually tax-supported, but to give back, if you can't afford to contribute to the Library immediately, you can still promote their fund-raising or book/media-drive efforts.</p>

<h2>Check out thrift stores and garage or yard sales</h2>

<p>If you don't mind buying things that may be second hand, thrift stores and garage or yard sales can have <em>anything</em>. The ones near you may have one or two items on your list of things you were looking for - for pennies on the dollar. </p>

<h2>Borrow from or swap with your friends</h2>

<p>Other items might be things you can share with friends. Borrow or swap things until you get bored of them. If you don't have a network of friends with shared interests, there may be a local freecycle or relevant meetup group you can join. </p>

<p>The key here is to try to contribute more than you take (and you probably have things you don't need that you can start with trading), and don't keep careful score. The upshot is you'll not only save money but make friends while doing it.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>You can sometimes have your cake and eat it too. These recommendations can get you the short-term happiness you were looking for, without spending the money. And when the happiness is gone, you won't feel like you need to hang on to the item indefinitely - you can pass it on for others to enjoy.</p>

"What does it mean to have ""interest in"" or ""signature authority over"" an account?","16257","","<p>My tax software is asking me how many foreign accounts I have an ""interest in"" and how many I have ""signature authority"" over.  I am unsure of how there terms are defined in this context.</p>

<p>What does it mean to have ""interest in"" or ""signature authority over"" an account?</p>
","<p><strong>Interest</strong> means that the money on the accounts belongs to you, regardless of who's name is the account titled to. For example, if you give money to someone (non-US person, say,  trying to avoid FBAR requirements) and that person puts it in his account but will give you money whenever you ask for it - you have <em>interest</em> in that account. This is in order for people not to avoid FBAR requirements by putting their money into someone's else accounts.</p>

<p><strong>Signature Authority</strong> means that although the account is not in your name, and the money on it is not your money - <em>you</em> have the right to access that account and perform operations on it. This usually happens when people are employees of a company and have signature authority over the company's accounts, but it is also frequently the case for people having signature authority over the accounts that belong to their family members (for example - your parents are not US persons, but they gave you access to their account because they don't know how to work with the bank and you do - you have signature authority over the account).</p>

"1 year old car is dead, called the car dealer they can fix it only if I can bring it, what should I do?","16118","","<p>I have a new Toyota Prius (2017 model), bought between 12-13 months ago.</p>

<p>The car recently has gone totally mad (Ironically 1 week after the service). So I arranged a booking to get it checked out, but the car won’t start. On top of that, the car dealer isn’t close and the appointment is in a 2-hour time slot, and every time needs to be rearranged.</p>

<p>When I called them they said I should ask my insurance to bring the car to them. My insurance doesn’t have roadside assistance, and to bring the car to them I need to subscribe a new one (Toyota roadside assistance).</p>

<p>I have no idea what should I do and how to avoid paying a non-refundable third party to bring the car there.</p>

<p>Here is a video of the problem: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljLNUodaNKM"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljLNUodaNKM</a></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update 1</strong>: The car died definitely after the video, now doesn't blink, it doesn't turn on at all, the electronic lock on the doors don't work anymore (I had to close the doors from inside manually and then use the hidden key).</p>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong>: I call the dealer multiple times, was very hard but at the end, they reply to my questions about the warranty. I insisted on that because the warranty manual says: ""The warranty covers the cost of towing your vehicle to the nearest authorised Toyota repairer in the event of breakdown immobilizing your vehicle, if that breakdown is the result of a warrantable defect.""</p>

<p>When I call the Toyota UK mainline, they said that the local car dealer has to tow my car, however, when I speak with the car dealer they said AA has to tow the car even after I read them the warranty, that they signed on the first page. At the end, I didn’t have any other choice that subscribes a roadside assistance with AA on behalf of Toyota since Toyota roadside assistance is AA.</p>

<p><strong>Update 3</strong>: today (12/12), I call Toyota roadside assistance, at the beginning they didn't found my cover, after passing them the code they sent in the email they verified I'm covered and they redirected the call to AA.
AA sent a technician to check the car in my driveway, the idea was that they fix the car enough to make it drivable tomorrow morning so I can bring to the dealer. Unfortunately the battery is fully dead (it has 3V of output), and the battery didn't charge at all. So I had to come back from the office because the car couldn't be turn off (if you turn  itoff you can't turn it on again, and my girlfriend can't drive), I drove the car to the dealer, once I parked the car in front of the garage, I turn it off, when I tried to turn it on again to check, didn't turn on (the car was on for around 1h and 30 minutes). Tomorrow morning a mechanic will check the car, and hopefully they will fix it free of charge.</p>

  <ol>

  <li><p>If the ask size is significantly larger than the bid size, then the supply of the stock is larger than the demand for the stock; therefore, the stock price is likely to drop.</p></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>(In regards to 3. and 4. is it really this simple? Are there cases when  this is not true? What would be some other caveats when following these rules of thumb?)</p>
","<p>In the stock market many participants enter orders that are not necessarily set at the current market price of the stock (i.e. they are not market orders, they are limit orders). They can be lower than the market price (if they want to buy) or they can be higher than the market price (if they want to sell). The set of orders at each point of time for a security is called the order book.</p>

<p>The lowest selling price of the order book is the offer or ask, the higher buying price is the bid. The more liquid is a security, the more orders will be in the order book, and the narrower will be the bid-ask spread. The depth of the order book is the number of units that the order book can absorb in any direction (buy or sell).</p>

<p>As an example: imagine I want to buy 100 units at the lowest offer, but the size of the lowest offer is only 50 units, and there is not any further order, that means the stock has little depth.</p>

Or am I tied to my employer provided HSA bank?</p>

<p>My company does not provide any employer contribution to the HSA, in case that's relevant.</p>
","<p>HSA accounts come with various rules intended to ensure that the pre-tax money you have opted to put into your HSA account is indeed used for appropriate purposes. Most employers don't handle these accounts in-house but contract with a company or bank who offers to take care of the details and the necessary accounting: the money is simply sent to the bank, and it is the bank that is responsible for ensuring that the money is indeed used appropriately. Now, if you say that you want Wells Fargo (to pick another bank as an example) to handle your HSA account, the 
employer will likely need to have a 
contract with Wells Fargo too, and Wells Fargo will charge you fees to handle 
the account also.  Whether you will be any happier with Wells Fargo's fees for

","<p>Yes, the extra matching contribution your employer puts into your group RRSP plan is considered employment income and so <strong>yes</strong> it would be included in the income reported on your T4.</p>

<p>However, you should also receive from your RRSP plan administrator a contribution receipt, and the amount on that receipt should include both your contributions and the $500. Consequently, you should be able to deduct that $500 from your income when you file your income tax return.</p>

"Is it better to pay off a loan with a higher interest rate or one with a much higher principal balance?","15984","","<p>Okay, we'll start off with some backstory. I went to a for-profit university with absolutely no financial assistance, so now I'm in a very large amount of debt. I've read almost everyone on this site suggests to pay down the loans with the higest interest rate first, for the most part as a hard and fast rule.</p>

<p>As it stands right now, I'm doing just that. But now I'm thinking towards the future. When I pay this one off I'm going to need to choose which of the other loans to hammer down and I'm having some trouble deciding. It breaks down like this(round numbers for easy math):</p>

<pre><code>Loan A: Principal balance of $50,000 Interest: 3%
Loan B: Principal balance of $15,000 Interest: 5%
</code></pre>

<p>Based on the ""Pay the highest interest rate first"" rule, I should be paying down loan B first, but that doesn't make much sense to me; loan A is accruing more interest every month. Am I correct in assuming that I should be paying down loan A first, or is there more long term math that I'm missing out on? Thanks!</p>
","<p>You should definitely pay down Loan B first.</p>

<p>Usually this is trickier because the higher balance is also the higher interest rate, so the dilemma is whether to use <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/q/39/19591"">the snowball method</a> or not. </p>

<p>To summarize briefly, the idea of the snowball method is to pay down smaller balances first, because it feels more successful and therefore makes it more likely you'll stick with it. The amount being paid toward the smallest balance then gets added to the minimum payment of the next smallest balance once the smallest is paid off (this is where the ""snowball"" name comes from, the payments get bigger and bigger as you finish smaller balances).</p>

<p>In this case, the mathematically better option and the psychologically better option are one in the same.</p>

<p>The reason the math works better is because every $1 you put toward the higher interest rate saves 5% of $1 ($0.05) vs 3% of $1 ($0.03).</p>

<p>The fact that the dollar amount in interest is higher on the larger balance is irrelevant here. Loan A is accruing more interest <em>in total dollars</em> per month, but Loan B is accruing more interest <em>per dollar</em> per month.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> To put my question another way, ""[If] instead of doing whatever I did, I invested in an S&amp;P index fund, how would I have performed?""</p>
","<p>It's easy for me to look at an IRA, no deposits or withdrawal in a year, and compare the return to some index. Once you start adding transactions, not so easy. Here's a method that answers your goal as closely as I can offer:</p>

<p>SPY goes back to 1993. It's the most quoted EFT that replicates the S&amp;P 500, and you specifically asked to compare how the investment would have gone if you were in such a fund. This is an important distinction, as I don't have to adjust for its .09% expense, as you would have been subject to it in this fund.</p>

<p>Simply go to <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=SPY%20Historical%20Prices"" rel=""nofollow"">Yahoo</a>, and start with the historical prices. Easy to do this on a spreadsheet. I'll assume you can find all your purchases inc dates &amp; dollars invested. Look these up and treat those dollars as purchases of SPY. Once the list is done, go back and look up the dividends, issues quarterly, and on the dividend date, add the shares it would purchase based on that day's price. Of course, any withdrawals get accounted for the same way, take out the number of SPY shares it would have bought. Remember to include the commission on SPY, whatever your broker charges. </p>

<p>If I've missed something, I'm sure we'll see someone point that out, I'd be happy to edit that in, to make this wiki-worthy. </p>

<p>Edit - due to the nature of comments and the inability to edit, I'm adding this here. Perhaps I'm reading the question too pedantically, perhaps not. I'm reading it as ""if instead of doing whatever I did, I invested in an S&amp;P index fund, how would I have performed?"" To measure one's return against a benchmark, the mechanics of the benchmarks calculation are not needed. In a comment I offer an example - if there were an ETF based on some type of black-box investing for which the investments were not disclosed at all, only day's end pricing, my answer above still applies exactly. The validity of such comparisons is a different question, but the fact that the formulation of the EFT doesn't come into play remains.

<p>My question is simply this. When is her employer required to send me her T4 - Statement of Remuneration Paid? Am I correct in assuming that it must be filed with the government, and sent to me, no later than the end of February, 2012?</p>
","<p>Sorry for your loss.  You may wish to use the services of a professional.  Filing a final return for a deceased person may not be straightforward if the estate is complex.  Nevertheless, if you are comfortable learning what needs to be done, it isn't rocket science &ndash; and you've discovered already that Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) provides some guidance.  You can call them if questions come up during the process.</p>

<p>To answer your specific question:</p>

<p>Yes, you are correct that the employer is required, by law, to send out an employee's T4 slip no later than the last day of February the following year, or the next business day if the last day of February falls on a weekend.</p>

<p>However, in a case such as this, earnings can typically be known in advance of year end, and <strong>it is possible to get a T4 issued early</strong>.  In fact, CRA has a guide for employers, <a href=""http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/tg/rc4120/rc4120-lp-10e.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Filing the T4 Slip and Summary (PDF)</a> which suggests, on page 18:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If an employee leaves, we suggest you calculate the employee's
  earnings for the year to date and give the employee a T4 slip. Keep
  our [CRA's] copy of the slip and include it with your T4 Summary when you
  file it on or before the last day of February of the following year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, it is both permitted and feasible for your wife's employer to issue her final T4 early.  If you contact your wife's company HR department to request that, I would hope and expect they would be understanding and helpful, considering the situation.</p>

<p>One more related tip, if you haven't done so already:  Make sure any earnings or benefits owed to your wife's estate by the company (or their insurance plans) have been paid out, such as regular pay for the final pay period worked, quarterly profit sharing (if applicable), accrued but untaken vacation time (usually there is some), not-yet-reimbursed employment expenses (check her credit card statements, if she typically incurred work expenses), etc.</p>

"Can I negotiate to have a credit card interest fee waived?","15763","","<p>I recently missed a credit card payment by one day (my first one ever in my history of credit starting from over 10 years ago), and I called the credit card company to have the late fee waived. I reasoned that this was a mistake, that I have excellent credit history (my score is very, very good too), and that it won't happen again.</p>

<p>I pay off my entire amount every month, and the credit card company agreed to waive the late fee. However, I was charged an interest on the balance that I had because I had missed the payment. I had tried calling them to waive the interest charges but had no luck.</p>

<p>Are credit card interest charges negotiable to be waived? I know late fee and interest fees (not charges) can be negotiated, but I was told this charge could not be. From my perspective, my activity would be worth more if I stayed as a customer than to let such a minuscule amount drive me away from their service.</p>

<p>What can I do to successfully negotiate the interest charge if possible? Is this something dependent on the company itself or will I have to bite the bullet and live with the charge?</p>
","<p>As the saying goes, <em>anything is negotiable.</em></p>

<p>And in this case, I have had credit card interest amounts refunded before. I had not  realized that a promotional APR had ended and a higher APR was in place. I was carrying a balance so I got hit with some interest. When I finally noticed, they agreed to go back and credit some back interest.</p>

<p>So <strong>yes, this is possible.</strong> However, it depends completely on your credit card provider, your account history, your current credit disposition, and more. It won't hurt to ask, but you may get ""no"" as an answer if they have a policy against it, or they don't see you as a big customer, or they're having a bad month for their bottom line, or if the moon is in the wrong phase.</p>

<p>Tips to try to get interest credited/waived would be the same as most when dealing with credit cards:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ask to speak to a manager</li>
<li>Ask to speak to the cancellation department</li>
<li>Threaten to switch/balance-transfer to another card and cut this one up</li>
<li>Alternatively, ask if they have any promotions going on</li>

<p>You should have signed this form and received a copy of the tax return, otherwise - the CPA cannot file anything.</p>

<p>In case your CPA is a crook and filed your tax return without your authorization - you'll see it on your IRS transcript. I wrote a <a href=""http://littleadvisor.wordpress.com/2014/01/18/great-new-service-from-the-irs-get-your-account-transcripts-online/"">detail article on how to get that</a>. However, CPA doing so may very easily lose the license, so I doubt that it happened in your case.</p>

<p>More likely than not your CPA just didn't do it on time. If it results in any penalties for you - you can demand the CPA to cover it (but not the actual tax - that is yours). If you're due refund there will be no penalties.</p>

"Why are 30-year mortgages seen as unwise, if you can pay off the loan in a shorter period of time anyway?","15624","","<p>I'm slowly working towards buying my first home (yay!), and have been playing around with the numbers. As far as I can tell, there's literally zero advantage for getting a 10 or 15-year mortgage since I can just get the exact same mortgage in a 30-year version, and just pay it off within whatever year window I choose.</p>

<p>So let's say I wanted to pay off my house in 10 years. If I get a 30-year mortgage and pay it off in 10 years then the same interest is paid as if I got a 10-year mortgage to begin with. Plus, if I get a 30-year mortgage then I have a cushion in case I run into major financial hardship.</p>

<p>Yet everywhere I look I see people online going on about how unwise 30-year mortgages are, as if they are irresponsible or something. Why is this?</p>
","<p>Two reasons are typically cited (I've heard these from Dave Ramsey):</p>

<ol>
<li>Generally you get a little better rate on a 15-year loan than a 30-year loan, so equal rates at 15 and 30 years is (typically) a false comparison.  It's less risk for a bank when there's a shorter term.  If you've got these side-by-side, I'd suggest looking for a better lender for the 15-year loan in particular.</li>
<li>If you make the payments on time, a 15-year loan always gets paid off in 15 years or less.  A 30-year loan that you <strong><em>plan</em></strong> to pay like a 15-year loan <strong><em>may</em></strong> get paid off in 15 years.  Yes, having flexibility is nice, but often people rationalize using that flexibility for things they don't really need.</li>
</ol>

<p>So I wouldn't refinance to a 15-year loan just for item 2, but would definitely look at it for the better interest rates.</p>

"Am I considered in debt if I pay a mortgage?","15580","","<p>75% of Americans are in debt. I'd like to know if I'm also considered in debt if I am paying my mortgage on a house.</p>

<p>I didn't think I was in debt if I own the house. I guess I pay 'rent' to a bank who sold the mortgage to me. If I stop paying, I lose the house I never 'owned'.</p>

<p>So what is the reality? Are people considered in debt if their only 'debt' is the mortgage/loan for their house, or are these people excluded from the statistic?</p>
","<p>The statistic you cited comes from the Federal Reserve Board's Survey of Consumer Finances, a survey that they do every three years, most recently in 2013.  This was reported in the <a href=""http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2014/articles/scf/scf.htm#xsubsection-117-ce463a47"">September 2014 issue of the Federal Reserve Bulletin</a>.  They list the percentage of Americans with any type of debt as 74.5 in 2013, down slightly from 74.9 in 2010.</p>

<p>The Bulletin also has a table with a breakdown of the types of debt that people have, and primary residence mortgages are at the top of the list.  So the answer is yes, the 75% statistic includes Americans with home mortgages.*</p>

<p>The bigger question is, are you really ""in debt"" if you have a home mortgage?  The answer to that is also yes.  When you take out a mortgage, you really do own the house.  You decide who lives there, you decide what changes you are going to make to it, and you are responsible for the upkeep.  But the mortgage debt you have is secured by the house.  This means that if you refuse to pay, the bank is allowed to take possession of the house.  They don't even get the ""whole"" house, though; they will sell it to recoup their losses, and give you back whatever equity you had in the house after the loan is satisfied.</p>

<p>Is it good debt?  Many people think that if you are borrowing money to purchase an appreciating asset, the debt is acceptable.  With this definition, a car loan is bad, credit card debt is very bad, and a home mortgage might be okay.  Even Dave Ramsey, radio host and champion of the debt-free lifestyle, is not opposed to home mortgages.  Home mortgages allow people to purchase a home that they would otherwise be unable to afford.</p>

<hr>

<p><sub>* Interestingly, according to the <a href=""http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2014/articles/scf/scf.htm#xsubsection-1195-ceafa12e"">bulletin appendix</a>, credit card balances were only included as debt for the survey purposes if there was a balance after the most recent bill was paid, not including purchases made after the bill.  So people that do not carry a balance on their credit card were not considered ""in debt"" in this statistic.</sub></p>

"Should I sell my stocks when the stock hits a 52-week high in order to ""Buy Low, Sell High""?","15547","","<p>I have a 10 stock portfolio and considering market conditions that are on the rise when this question in being asked, a few of them did hit their 52-week high price.</p>

<p>I would like to call myself a long term investor and I do not like to trade so much. If I take <strong>""Buy low sell high""</strong> as gospel then this is in my opinion a good selling position.</p>

<p>On one hand, I think I should lock my profit because stocks don't hit a 52-week high every day, but on the other hand, there is nothing wrong with the company and it is very well positioned to go up even further.</p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>
","<p>Though it seems unintuitive, you should rationally ignore the past performance of this stock (including the fact that it's at its 52-week high) and focus exclusively on factors that you believe should affect it <em>moving forward.</em>  If you think it's going to go up even further,  more than the return on your other options for where to put the money, keep the stock.  If you think it's peaked and will be going down, now's a good time to sell.</p>

<p>To put it another way: <strong>if you didn't already have this stock, would you buy it today?</strong><br>
Your choice is just about the same: you can choose between a sum of cash equal to the present market value of the shares, OR the shares.   Which do you think is worth more?</p>

<p>You also mentioned that you only have 10 stocks in the portfolio.  Some are probably a larger percentage than others, and this distribution may be different than what you want in your portfolio.  It may be time to do some <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebalancing_investments"" rel=""noreferrer"">rebalancing</a>, which could involve selling some shares where your position is too large (as a % of your portfolio) and using the proceeds toward one or more categories you're not as invested in as you would like to be.  This might be a good opportunity to increase the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversification_%28finance%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">diversity</a> in your portfolio.</p>

<p>If part of your reward and motivation for trading is emotional, not purely financial, you could sell now, mark it as a ""win,"" and move on to another opportunity.  Trading based on emotions is not likely to optimize your future balance, but not everybody is into trading or money for money's sake.  What's going to help you sleep better at night and help boost your quality of life?  If holding the stock will make you stress and regret a missed opportunity if it goes down, and selling it will make you feel happy and confident even if it still goes up more (e.g. you interpret that as further confirming that you made a good pick in the first place), you might decide that the risk of suboptimal financial returns (from emotion-based trading) is acceptable. </p>

<p>As CQM points out, you could also set a trailing sell order to activate only when the stock is a certain percentage or dollar amount below whatever it peaks at between the time you set the order and the time it fires/expires; the activation price will rise with the stock and hold as it falls.  </p>

It's also very common for purchasers to offer their own shares instead of cash, or a mixture of cash and shares. It's generally all-or-nothing -- if more than a certain percentage (usually 50%) of shareholders vote to accept the offer, then the remaining shareholders must also sell their shares on the same terms, and if the offer gets less votes than are required than the potential purchaser doesn't buy any shares.</p>

"Oversimplify it for me: the correct order of investing","15528","","<p>I have been reading the top posts here, and the recommendations for what to invest in are often similar. What I'd like to know, in as simply of terms as possible, is what the consensus is on <strong>priority of these investments</strong>.</p>

<p>I am new to this, but here are some of the obvious options:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Paying off credit card debt</p></li>
<li><p>Paying off mortgage / student loans</p></li>

<p>(For example:</p>

<ol>
<li>Pay off credit debt</li>
<li>Emergency fund for 6 months</li>
<li>401k up to match</li>
<li><strong>...</strong> )</li>
</ol>
","<p>I am a firm believer in the idea of limiting debt as much as possible.  I would not recommend borrowing money for anything other than a reasonably sized mortgage.  As a result, my recommendations are going to be geared toward that goal.</p>

<p>The top priorities for me, then, would be to make sure, first, that we don't have to go further into debt, and second, that we eliminate the debt that we already have as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Here is how I would rate your list:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Putting together a small emergency fund</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>A small emergency fund, perhaps $1000 USD, is going to ensure that, while you are funding other things, you don't end up so cash poor that, if something unexpected and urgent comes up, you are forced to add to your credit card debt.  Make this small fund your top priority, and it shouldn't take much more than a month or two to do it.</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li><strong>401(k) up to the employer match</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Getting out of debt is important, but if your employer hands out free money, you have to take it.  It is just too good of a deal.</p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li><strong>Paying off credit card debt / car loans / student loans / other consumer debt</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Get rid of this debt as fast as possible.  When you are done, you'll have more income available to you than you've ever had before.</p>

<ol start=""4"">
<li><strong>Building up your emergency fund</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Now that you have just gotten done eliminating your debt as fast as possible, don't stop there.  Take the income you had been throwing at your debt, and build up your emergency fund to a few months' worth of your expenses.  Finishing this fund up will enable you to withstand a small crisis without borrowing anything.</p>

<ol start=""5"">
<li><strong>Retirement savings: 401(k), IRA, etc.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>You are now in a very strong position financially, and can confidently invest.  Deciding which type of retirement account is best for you depends on the details of your situation.</p>

<ol start=""6"">
<li><strong>Paying off your mortgage early.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Once you are contributing a healthy amount to your retirement funds, you may want to consider paying off your mortgage early.</p>

<p>As I said before, I recommend getting down to the last step as quickly as possible.  Depending on how much debt you actually have, if you sacrifice for a year or two you could be debt free and in a position to keep all of your investment gains.  If you take your time paying off debt, like many people do, you could find yourself 10 years from now still making payments on your loans, still making car payments, and still needlessly sending interest to the banks, eating away at the gains you are making in your investments.</p>

<p>If you aren't committed to eliminating your debt quickly, and plan on having payments for a long time, then skip this advice and put retirement savings at the top.</p>

","<p>It is definately possible to deposit a Foreign currency check in US. On most currencies like CAD or GBP it would be very simple and easy.  </p>

<p>On INR as littleadv pointed out its up to the Bank.<br>
Technically the Bank's can do it, however there needs to be enough volume to justify or support this. Typically the checks are sent over to India via a correspondant Bank, then once the check is encashed in India, the funds are converted and credited into your USD account. Typically the entire process takes around 4-5 weeks and has quite a few manual intervention steps. </p>

<p>You can encash USD checks in India, and they follow the same process of sending the check to US, getting the funds and then crediting the funds into your account. As the volume of USD checks getting encashed in India is high, most the Banks in India would offer the service. However if you try to encash say a Chinese Yuan or Indonesian Rupiya check in India, you will not find Indian Bankers encashing the same.</p>

<p>So the best way to get money moved from India to US would be to buy a Bankers check denominated in USD in India and take it along to US. Alternatively initiate a Wire/SWIFT from India to transfer funds to US account. Note most banks in India do not allow an online mechanism to Initiate a Wire out of India and one has to visit the Branch to get it done. </p>

"How common is counterfeit money in circulation?","15321","","<p>I've noticed recently that several places where I paid with a $20 bill, the cashiers used a small marker to detect whether the bill was counterfeit or not before accepting it. <a href=""http://www.instructables.com/id/Counterfeit-money-pen/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Like so</a>:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YKIp4.jpg""></p>

<p>I saw this happen at</p>

<ul>
<li>the post office (multiple times)</li>
<li>the movie theater</li>
</ul>

<p>My question is .. why?</p>

<p>I could understand a bank doing this, since it's their job to be strict, but at common salt of the earth places like the movies and the post office? </p>

<p>It seems to me that counterfeit 20 dollar bills <em>should</em> be incredibly rare. But if a bunch of common places check for them .. that implies they must be appearing with some regularity?</p>

<p><strong>Are counterfeit 20 dollar bills (or, is counterfeit money in general) really that common in circulation</strong>? </p>
","<p>According to <a href=""http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/policy_discussion_papers/2010/PDP2010-2.pdf"">this study</a> put out this year by Judson and Porter, the face value of counterfeit currency relative to the total amount in circulation is about 0.01%:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We conclude that the total value of counterfeits in circulation at any moment is on the order of $60 to $80 million, or less than $1 for every $10,000 outstanding, and is highly unlikely to exceed $220 million, or less than $3 for every $10,000 in circulation. Further, we conclude that the incidence of counterfeits is roughly the same inside and outside the United States ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actual numbers from five years ago suggest about the same:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Out of the approximately <strong>$759 billion</strong> in U.S. dollars held in U.S. currency in the form of banknotes (paper currency) in circulation outside the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve at the end of 2005, the Secret Service reported that about $61 million in counterfeit currency was passed on the public worldwide. Of the counterfeit currency passed, the majority, <strong>$56.2 million</strong>, was passed in the United States, with the remainder passed abroad.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As to why they're checking:  Would <em>you</em> want to receive a counterfeit bill?</p>

<p>Costco checks my cash when I check out.  The guy I got a buggy ride from up in upstate New York checked my bill.  It's easy to check certain things on the bill.  Why not?</p>

"Pay online: credit card or debit card?","15320","","<p>I have a credit card and a debit card. I could use both to pay online. Credit card is only a bit less convenient since I have to transfer the money back in the credit card account later.</p>

<p>Is it safer to pay with a credit card though? I'm thinking that credit card money is bank's money, whereas debit card money is my money. So in case of fraud, my money would be lost (if paying by debit card), but in the case of credit card the bank would lose.</p>
","<p>Credit card, without a doubt.</p>

<p>The reason is <strong>dispute resolution</strong>. If you dispute a charge on debit card - the money has left your account already, and if the dispute was accepted - you'll get it back. <em>If</em>. <em>Eventually</em>. In the mean time your overdraft will be missing $$$.</p>

<p>For credit cards, you can catch a fraud action before the money actually leaves your pocket and dispute it then. In this case the charge is set aside, and you will only be required to actually pay if the dispute is rejected. I.e.: The money stays in <strong>your</strong> pocket, until the business proves that the charge is legit.</p>

<p>In both cases, if the dispute is justified (i.e.: there was indeed a fraud) neither you nor the bank will lose money at the bottom line, it's just who's got the money <strong>during</strong> the dispute resolution process (which may be lengthy) that matters.</p>

"Capital Gains in an S Corp","15287","","<p>In <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/15239/determining-the-minimum-dividend-that-should-be-paid-from-my-s-corporation"">this question about s-corp distributions</a>, the answer was given that an s-corp taxes all profit as personal income.  That is, there are neither distributions nor dividends which can be taxed at a capital gains tax-rate.</p>

<p>However, I've easily found web sites that say the opposite.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.journalofaccountancy.com/issues/2012/jan/20114319.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This one</a> talks about long-term capital gains with an S-Corp.  A loan is one example chosen.</li>
<li><a href=""http://taxes.about.com/od/scorporations/a/scorp_account.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This one</a> mentions long-term capital gains of the S-corp become long-term cap gains by shareholders</li>
<li><a href=""http://loopholelewy.com/loopholelewy/01-tax-basics-for-startups/s-corporations-03-capital-accounts.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This one</a> explains that a non-dividend distribution, beyond your ""tax basis"", is treated as a capital gain (rather than personal income, which other sites mention).  The specific quote is:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>If a shareholder receives a non-dividend distribution from an S corporation, the distribution is tax-free to the extent it does not exceed the shareholder's stock basis. If the distribution exceeds the shareholder's stock basis, the excess amount is a capital gain (short-term or long-term depending on how long the stock was held. If one year or less, it's a short-term capital gain, if held more than one year, it's a long-term capital gain</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am particularly interested in that last point; I understand the capital gains rate is often lower than the personal income tax rate.  How do I tap into this?</p>
","<p>These are all factually correct claims. S-Corporation is a pass-through entity, so whatever gain you have on the corporate level - is passed to the shareholders. If your S-Corp has capital gains - you'll get your pro-rata share of the capital gains. Interest? The same. Dividends? You get it on your K-1.</p>

<p>Earned income? Taxed as such to you. I.e.: whether you earn income as a S-Corp or as a sole proprietor - matters not. That's the answer to your bottom line question.</p>

<p>The big issue, however, is this: you cannot have more than 25% passive income in your S-Corp. You pass that limit (<a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1362"" rel=""nofollow"">three consecutive years</a>, one-off is ok) - your S-Corp <em>automatically</em> converts to C-Corp, and you're taxed at the corporate level at the corporate rates (you then lose the capital gains rates, personal brackets, etc).</p>

<p>This means that an S-Corp cannot be an <em>investment</em> company. Most (75%+) of its income has to be earned, not passive.</p>

<p>Another problem with S-Corp is that people who work as self-proprietors incorporated as S-Corp try to abuse it and claim that the income they earned by the virtue of their own personal performance shouldn't be taxed as self-employed income. IRS frowns upon such a position, and if considerable amounts are at stake will take you all the way up to the Tax Court to prove you wrong. This has happened before, numerously.</p>

<p>You should talk to a <em>licensed</em> tax adviser (EA/CPA/Attorney licensed in your state) to educate you about what S-Corp is and how it is taxed, and whether or not it is appropriate for you.</p>

"How do you calculate pretax deduction savings?","15276","","<p>I am trying to determine how much money I will save by participating in the <a href=""http://www.transitcenter.com/"">TransitChek</a> program. The way the program works is I can set aside a certain amount of money from my pay check before taxes are taken out for public transportation (you never have to pay taxes on these costs). </p>

<p>So lets say I spend $1,000.00/year on transportation and I get 60% of my gross pay taken out in taxes. Does that mean that I am saving $600 in a year? ($1,000.00 * 0.60) This amount seems like too much. </p>
","<p>I have a very hard time believing you pay 60% of gross.</p>

<p>Otherwise, I believe you're right in the way this works:</p>

<p>Suppose you make $100k and pay 25% of that in taxes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>100,000 * .25 = 25,000</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But if you spend $1,000 pretax, then it's as if you were paid $99,000</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>99,000 * .25 = $24,750</p>
</blockquote>

"Is it true that the price of diamonds is based on a monopoly?","15239","","<p>I've heard quite often that the only reason diamonds have the high value they have is because the price is set by a single worldwide diamond mining monopoly. That, if actual quantity versus demand is taken into account, diamonds are intrinsically worthless -- and therefore have quite little resale value.</p>

<p>How much of this is true? And who actually runs/owns this supposed monopoly? Is this likely to affect diamond prices if I am interested in purchasing?</p>
","<p>Yes, the De Beers Group of Companies is a diamond cartel that had complete control of the diamond market for most of the 20th century. They still control a sizable portion of the market and their effort at marketing (particularly with the slogan ""<a href=""http://www.debeersgroup.com/en/our-story/innovation-hub/a-diamond-is-forever.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">A Diamond is Forever</a>"") has done much to inflate the market for diamonds in our society.</p>

<p>The intrinsic value of diamonds is much lower than the market prices currently reflect, but with the caveat that there is a rarity factor which does drive up the price of larger diamonds.</p>

<p>The larger the diamond, the more likely it is to have flaws, so when it comes to diamonds that are 5 carats or greater, you are not as likely to see a new supply of diamonds disrupt the prices of those larger stones.</p>

<p>Some other ways that high end jewelers and suppliers are differentiating themselves is by <a href=""http://www.thejewelleryeditor.com/bridal/know-how/a-cut-above-how-patented-diamond-cuts-are-outshining-the-competition/"" rel=""noreferrer"">patenting a specific cut</a> that they design. This is another barrier to entry that works to create some artificial price inflation. One common example is the Lucida cut sometimes referred to as the Tiffany cut.</p>

<p>Diamonds can also be manufactured. The same carbon structure can be grown in a lab. These stones have the same carbon structure as natural diamonds but without the flaws and visible impurities. Most manufactured diamonds are used industrially, but processes have improved sufficiently to allow for gemstone quality synthetic diamonds. They sell at a decent discount, so that might be an option to consider if you want a substitute. In the years to come, you can expect prices for synthetic diamonds to continue to decrease which will probably put some further downward pressure on jewelers' prices.</p>

","<p>Maybe learn a bit more before plunging in with your own money, buy some good books on the subject and on technical analysis. Open up a virtual account and test your strategies first, develop a trading plan and include risk management in it, think about what the worst case scenario will be on each trade. Learn about position sizing and where to place your stop losses. A good book to start with is ""Trade your way to Financial Freedom"" by Van Tharp.</p>

<p>$1000 is a bit small to start even if you use margin, because one bad trade can wipe you out, or even worse, you could lose even more than your $1000 if using margin whilst you don't know what you are doing. Whilst you are learning about trading and technical analysis save up some more money. I would use a minimum of $5000 and preferably over $10000 if using margin and at least $20000 without margin.</p>

<p>Also one other thing, day trading means you will need to spend most of your day in front of your screen, will this interfere with your day job and will you be getting enough sleep? You need to be trading with a clear mind. There are alternatives to day trading, position trading and swing trading to name 2. You will be in a position from a couple of days to a couple of weeks in these type of trading and you won't have to be in front of your screen all day. You can spend one or two hours per day after market close to place new orders and manage existing ones, that way it won't interfere with your day job or other daily activities you do.</p>

"Why do financial institutions charge so much to convert currency?","15062","","<p>With all the modern technology that we have, I am astonished that financial institutions charge such exorbitant prices for currency conversions. My bank, Fifth Third, charges a <a href=""https://www.53.com/content/dam/fifth-third/docs/legal/pew-summary.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">3% conversion fee</a>, while <a href=""https://cms.paypal.com/au/cgi-bin/?cmd=_render-content&amp;content_ID=ua/CombinedFinancialServicesGuideandProductDisclosure_full&amp;locale.x=en_AU"" rel=""noreferrer"">Paypal charges about 4%</a>. I know that currency fluctuates - free-floating and managed - but I can't understand why there is such a high conversion fee, let alone a conversion fee at all.</p>

<p>Is there not some central service that tracks current currency rates that banks can use to get currency data? For example, XE has an API (web service) that for $12,000/year gets you live currency data with unlimited requests. But at 3% they would only need $400,000 to recover such an expense; this is purely speculation, but as a major national bank, I would imagine that they have much much more than $400,000 in international transactions per year. This is even more true for Paypal, yet bizarrely their rate is even higher at 4%!</p>

<p>Why do these fees exist? Are there back-end processes and requirements that require financial institutions to pass off the loss to consumers as a fee? Or, is it just to make money on the convenience of international transactions?</p>
","<p>Mainly <em>because they can</em>. </p>

<p>Yes, there is a cost for banks to execute such transactions, and yes, there is a cost to cover the implied risks, but it is far from 3 or 4%.</p>

<p>There are banks that charge a flat rate of less than 30$ (and no percentage), so for larger amounts, it is worth shopping around. Note that for smaller amounts, which are the majority of personal transactions, that is probably about as, if not more expensive, than paying 3% - below 1000$, 3% is less than 30$. So charging a percentage is actually better for people that want to transfer smaller amounts.</p>

"Calculating a stock's price target","14980","","<p>In the book 'Insider Buy Superstocks', he seems to be calculating price targets like this:</p>

<pre><code>[last quarter EPS] x 4 x PE = price target
</code></pre>

<p>Does that look correct?</p>

<p>Is he basing PE off the current stock price?  </p>

<p>On page 105, he uses the example of an $11 stock with an EPS of $0.35 and PE multiple of 20.  The price target looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>$0.35 x 4 quarters = $1.40 x 20PE = $28.
</code></pre>

<p>Where does the 20PE come from?  Shouldn't PE be $11/.35 = $31.43.</p>

<p>CVRR's last earnings were $2.3.  It's current price is $24.25.  That would give it a target of 2.3 x 4 x (24.25/2.3) = 9.2 x 10.54 = $96.97, which is highly unlikely anytime soon.</p>
","<p>The price-earnings ratio is calculated as the market value per share divided by the earnings per share over the past 12 months.</p>

<p>In your example, you state that the company earned $0.35 over the past quarter. That is insufficient to calculate the price-earnings ratio, and probably why the PE is just given as 20.</p>

<p>So, if you have transcribed the formula correctly, the calculation given the numbers in your example would be:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>0.35 * 4 * 20 = $28.00</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As to CVRR, I'm not sure your PE is correct. According to <a href=""http://ca.finance.yahoo.com/q?s=CVRR"" rel=""nofollow"">Yahoo</a>, the PE for CVRR is 3.92 at the time of writing, not 10.54. Using the formula above, this would lead to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2.3 * 4 * 3.92 = $36.06</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That stock has a 52-week high of $35.98, so $36.06 is not laughably unrealistic. I'm more than a little dubious of the validity of that formula, however, and urge you not to base your investing decisions on it.</p>

Does it pull data from the real stock market? Is there something better? Can anybody comment on how close it is to real investing?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>While I've never used Wall Street Survivor, I took a look over the marketing materials and I've seen multiple similar contests run among investment interns also just out of college.  I see some good here and some bad.</p>

<p>First off, I love interactive web-based tutorials.  I've used one to learn the syntax of a new programming language and I find the instant feedback and the ability to work at your own pace very useful.  The reviews seem to say that Wall Street Survivor is a good way to learn the basics of how trading stocks works and the lingo.  Also, it seems pretty fun which <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Typing_of_the_Dead"" rel=""nofollow"">I've found helps a lot</a>.</p>

<p>Wall Street Survivor will hopefully teach you that there are many real stock markets and that they may have somewhat different prices and they likely take the real and timely data from a single market.</p>

<p>Wall Street Survivor also frightens me.  The big problem that I see with interns running similar contests is that the market is extremely random over short to medium periods of time.  An intern can make an awful portfolio or even pick stocks at random and still win the contest.  These interns know a lot about the randomness in markets already so they don't believe they are trading geniuses because they won a contest, I'm not sure there is much to temper this view on this web-site.</p>

<p>Also, while Wall Street Survivor teaches you about trading it doesn't appear to teach you about investing.  The website appears to encourage short term views and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churning_%28finance%29"" rel=""nofollow"">changing positions a lot</a> and doesn't seem to simulate the full trading costs (including fees) that would eat away at the gains of a individual investor that trades that much.  It gives some help with longer term thinking like diversification, but also seems to encourage trading that makes Wall Street Survivor more money, but are likely detrimental to the user.</p>

<p>I would say have fun with Wall Street Survivor. Let it teach you some things about trading, but don't give the site much if any money.  At the same time, pick up a copy of short book called ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Random_Walk_Down_Wall_Street"" rel=""nofollow"">A Random Walk Down Wall Street</a>"" and start learning about investing at the same time.

"""Out of Pocket Maximum"" and health insurance plan terminology & calculation?","14866","","<p>I'm trying to understand the terminology on my health plan.  I've read numerous websites, which have only confused me more, as they fail to use examples (more than one should be required) for people trying to understand this tricky terminology.</p>

<p>I have a plan similar to this one (High Deductible): <a href=""http://provider.healthcare.cigna.com/PDFs/Prudential/2011_813842cHSAFund.pdf"">http://provider.healthcare.cigna.com/PDFs/Prudential/2011_813842cHSAFund.pdf</a>, except that the In-Network Coverage Year Deductible is $3,000 per family, Out-of-Pocket Maximum (<em>includes deductibles, excludes copays</em>) is $10,000 per family, and Office Visits, Inpatient Hospitalization/Surgery, Outpatient Surgery In-Network are 80% after deductible (confused: 80%  covered? Not covered?  It doesn't specify, nor does it list examples for me to grasp how this works).</p>

<p>For anyone who understands this terminology, let me try to understand this by using one example (I may use another one if I'm still confused, but for now, this should work):</p>

<p>We had a hospitalization cost of $150,000, including the emergency room, ICU and general hospital cost after the ICU for 5 days.  After that, we had to do inpatient care for 21 days at a cost of $1000 per day.  So, at this point, the total out of pocket cost if we had no insurance would be $171,000.  On top of that, we'll be doing outpatient rehab at a cost of $400 per day for 3 days a week for a total of 16 weeks (total cost of the outpatient rehab is $19,200; total cost overall is $190,200).  Using the insurance plan listed above this, what would we owe?</p>

<p>My assumption is that we would owe $10,000 since that is the maximum out of pocket; but I begin getting confused by the 80% deductibles (which, seem to contradict the very nature of a High Deductible plan - the idea is that once you are over a maximum, they pay everything; or at least, they used to).</p>
","<p>Thanks for your question. Unfortunately, you're correct that these types of benefits often are not well explained. Let me apologize in advance for a long answer, but I'd like to provide the most comprehensive explanation I can.</p>

<p>Additionally, there are a number of factors involved that weren't mentioned in your example, but that could substantially affect how benefits are determined. For example, it is possible that:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The different types of care received could be covered at different rates, based on network status or the type of service provided (e.g. my plan covers rehab at a different coinsurance rate than a hospital stay.)</p></li>
<li><p>Some of the services provided to you in all of these settings may have been out-of-network as well as in-network (e.g. it is very common for an in-network hospital to assign you doctors that are out-of-network) which could be paid at different levels based on network status.</p></li>
<li><p>If these services were all for one patient, it's very possible that your plan may have an individual deductible and/or out-of-pocket maximum that is different from the family deductible and/or out-of-pocket maximum, and this could also affect how benefits are determined.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you have an HSA similar to what is listed in the link you provided, this is likely not a factor. This is primarily a savings account that allows you and your employer to contribute so that you don't have to come up with the full deductible when care is needed. Also, the 80% you are seeing is probably an 80% coinsurance. That would mean that once you've met your deductible, 80% of the allowable costs would be covered by insurance, 20% would be paid by you, and the remainder of the costs would either be written off (if in-network) or billed to you (if out-of-network).</p>

<p>I'll speak more to each of these concepts later in my answer.</p>

<p><strong>Assumptions and New Example</strong></p>

<p>Because of the factors I mentioned above, I'm going to use a simplified example to explain the out-of-pocket maximum concept, and then explain how some of the additional factors you mentioned (or that weren't specified) might also affect this. Let's assume the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>One individual with insurance</li>
<li>$3,000.00 individual in-network deductible</li>
<li>$10,000.00 individual in-network out-of-pocket maximum</li>
<li>No part of the deductible has been met yet</li>
<li>$190,000.00 of allowable in-network charges</li>
<li>All of the charges listed in (5) are covered at 80% coinsurance (no co-pay)</li>
</ol>

<p>You're probably familiar with these terms, but for those who may not be:</p>

<p><strong>Deductible</strong> is the amount you must pay before your insurance ""kicks in"" and begins to pay benefits. People often elect a higher deductible to lower their premium if they don't expect to need care frequently. Please note that in all plans which I'm aware of, the deductible and copays do not apply to your out-of-pocket maximum. The out-of-pocket maximum only reflects the coinsurance paid toward services which your plan specifies as pertaining to the out-of-pocket maximum (some services do not apply).</p>

<p><strong>Copay</strong> is when you pay a fixed dollar cost regardless of the amount of services you receive. Common examples for this include a doctor's office visit or prescription drugs.</p>

<p><strong>Coinsurance</strong> is when you share the cost with your insurer on a percentage basis. So in this example, for $1,000.00 of allowable in-network charges, you would pay $200.00 and your insurer would pay $800.00, assuming that you had already met your deductible.</p>

<p><strong>Out-of-Pocket Maximum (OOP max)</strong> The amount after which your insurance pays for 100% of covered care, and your share of applicable charges falls to 0%. Please note that this amount typically excludes the deductible, copays, and some services which may be specified by your plan (for example, I have coverage on a coinsurance basis for chiropractic care, but the coinsurance I pay does not add to the total paid toward my out-of-pocket maximum.) This amount is based on the amount of coinsurance you've paid, not the total charges.</p>

<p><strong>Application</strong></p>

<p>I find it useful to think of how insurance works in terms of several buckets (the industry term is ""accumulators"" or ""accums""). When you've filled bucket #1, you start filling bucket #2, and so on. In this case, the first accum is the deductible, the second is the out-of-pocket max, and after that, certain care is paid at 100%. Typically, we speak of the deductible and the out-of-pocket-maximum amounts as having been ""met"" or ""not met"".</p>

<p>So in this example, the individual would first pay the $3,000.00 deductible, reducing the remaining charges to $187,000.00. At this point, the deductible accum (or bucket) has been ""met"", so insurance benefits will begin to be paid, but nothing has yet been applied to the out-of-pocket-max accum. For the next $50,000.00 of services, your share (coinsurance) is 20%, or $10,000.00, and the remaining $40,000.00 is paid by your insurer. So now the remaining balance has been reduced to $137,000.00, you have ""met"" your out-of-pocket maximum, and the total you've paid is $13,000.00. Since you have met your out-of-pocket maximum, the remaining balance is paid at 100% by your insurer (you pay 0%). <strong>So you've paid a total of $13,000.00 in this example.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Real-World Differences</strong></p>

<p>In real life, there are a number of potential differences that could substantially change the amount you'd need to pay. For example:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If some of the services were billed out-of-network, they may not apply to your in-network accums (deductible or OOP max). If you have out-of-network coverage, you may have <strong>separate</strong> accums that need to be met before benefits will be paid on services provided out of network. Additionally, even if you meet your deductible, you may be subject to balance billing by out-of-network providers, meaning that you'd pay any amount over what your insurer deems to be a reasonable charge for the services you received, in addition to your deductible and coinsurance, as the out-of-network services providers are not contractually obligated to write off any billed amount over the amount that your insurer deems to be reasonable. If you have no out-of-network coverage, you may be responsible for all charges.</p></li>
<li><p>Some of the services may not apply to the out-of-pocket-max accum at all, depending on the specifics of your plan. You will need to refer to your benefit booklet here to determine what services may or may not be included. If this is the case, you would continue to pay your coinsurance (20%, assuming they are in-network) on these services indefinitely and without limit.</p></li>
<li><p>Your plan year or accums may differ from the calendar year. In some cases, you may be on a different calendar for your benefits than your accums. For instance, I know of some instances where the benefits change mid-year, but the accums balances are reset on a calendar year (Jan-Dec) basis in terms of when they reset. This can cause unexpected surprises if you think you've met your deductible or OOP max, but aren't aware of the difference.</p></li>
<li><p>If all services are billed as in-network, the insurer will often pay their coinsurance amount (80%) and assign yours (20%) based on the contracted rates your service provider has agreed to accept, regardless of what was billed. In a PPO setting, for example, the service provider would then write off the remainder of the charges. I bring this up so that you'll be aware of this when you see the bills and EOBs, so that you know that your coinsurance won't always be 20% of the total charges.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have family coverage, you may have separate family and individual accums for your in-network and/or out-of-network coverages. For example, I have a family plan covering myself and two other family members with a $2,000.00 in-network family deductible, but we also have a $1,000.00 in-network individual deductible. So if I pay $1,000.00 toward my deductible, my insurance will kick in for any other services I incur, but not for my other two family members. They would need to meet their deductibles first. Then, when the total deductible (for any/all 3 of us) exceeds $2,000.00, the family deductible is met and then no one needs to pay anything more toward deductible, even if they haven't yet exceeded $1,000.00 in deductible individually. We also have separate family and individual out-of-pocket maximum limits that work the same way.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I bring this up simply to say that if this is also the case for you, please be aware that simply because you've met the OOP max for one person in your family, you may still have to pay deductible or coinsurance (and always copays) for other members of your family who haven't yet met their deductible or OOP max. Even though the charges for the one individual may be greater than the family OOP max, once that person's individual OOP max has been reached, further charges are paid at 100% and no additional coinsurance is paid, so no additional amount is applied to the family's OOP max (this also works the same way for individual/family deductibles).</p>

<p>All that being said, make sure you are aware of all the ""buckets"" that need to be filled (individual, family, in-network, out-of-network) before benefits are paid, and before your OOP max is met. </p>

<p>Also, please be aware that insurance will often pay bills and assign amounts to deductible, OOP max, etc. in the order the bills are received by them, not the order in which the services are provided to you. This can make it very frustrating to find out how charges were handled if you aren't working through the bills in the order which your insurer did. Again, you should see general pattern of (a) applied to deductible (you pay 100%), then (b) cost sharing (you pay 20%) then (c) OOP max reached (you pay 0%) for a given individual/family.</p>

<p>I hope this is helpful. I wish I knew of a way to make this more simple, but I wanted you to have all the information I'm aware of. Isn't it fun to deal with insurance companies?</p>

<p>To figure out what you will really need to pay, you will need to refer to your specific plan benefits. I would also recommend calling customer service to have someone walk through this specific example once they've received all the claims from your service provider. Best of luck!</p>

"Is 0% credit card utilization worse than 1-20% credit card utilization for any reason other than pure statistics?","14803","","<p>Much of the information I stumbled accross (including a <a href=""http://www.joetaxpayer.com/too-little-debt/"">short article</a> written by an esteemed member of this site) around the internet indicates that having a credit card utilization of 0% is a significant negative impact on one's FICO score.  While having a small utilization number (>0%) is viewed positively (or possibly 'less negatively') relative to 0% utilization.  I seek to understand why.</p>

<p>My question is, <em>do the FICO algorithms believe that people with 0% credit card utilization represent an increased risk based on something specific about people in this category?</em>  Or, <em>did they simply take a statisticaly large sample of people with a credit rating, put them into bins based on credit card utilization (one of which is 0%), and look at the relative risk of default with each bin?</em></p>

<p>I can wrap my head around how someone with high utilization is a credit risk relative to someone with less than high utilization, but, I cannot wrap my head around how having 0% utilization signifies the rating algorithms that someone is a significant risk relative to 1% utilization.  The only thing I can think of is that people with 0% utilization fall into the category of <em>never use the card and never will</em> and <em>do not use the card now, but will max it out soon</em> thus attaching a large standard deviation to the 0% bin, and, thus, statistically, someone in that bin is a risk.</p>
","<p>Having no utilization makes you an outlier, it's an unusual circumstance for most people, and the scoring model cannot make any predictions based on it. If you think of it from the underwriter's perspective, zero utilization could mean all sorts of things... are you dead? indigent? unable to work? </p>

<p>When you buying a product (like money or insurance) whose pricing is based on risk, being ""weird"" will usually make you a higher risk.</p>

<p>That said, it isn't the end of the world. If you are in this situation, I wouldn't lose sleep over it.</p>

<p>If not, is there anything I can do to request they offer one? Like, how would it benefit my employer? How would it work against them? etc. Thanks!</p>
","<p>Unfortunately, no.  An FSA is exclusively an employer-established plan.  Even self-employed people aren't eligible for an FSA.</p>

"How to spend more? (AKA, how to avoid being a miser)","14738","","<p>I was blessed growing up to have a father that greatly impressed upon me the need to save.  I am very thankful for his influence, it has allowed me to make smart decisions with my money and I am currently living completely debt free -- except for a mortgage on a house which is about to turn into a rental and actually provide positive cash flow.</p>

<p>This may seem all good and dandy, but I find recently that my dad's emphasis on saving has turned me a little ... well, stingy.</p>

<p>I spend <em>hours</em> researching two comparable products to try to save $3.  I refuse to buy any mobile phone app unless I've tried and <em>loved</em> the free version for over a year.  I spend hours on the phone complaining to my cable company, only to be satisfied to argue my way into a $5 credit.  I put two months of work into a home improvement project that a professional could have done in a weekend just to save money by doing it myself -- when in fact I could have paid him and taken a couple of side jobs and made back twice the money in 1/10th the time =/</p>

<p>In short, I don't think I'm valuing my time nearly as much as I should.  I'm in a healthy financial situation.  But I'm looking for tips on how to feel free to spend more money (smartly).  </p>

<p>This has been a tricky one to Google or search for, as most people are asking the exact opposite -- how do I spend less.  When in reality, I'm looking to spend more.  How can I avoid being a miser? </p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>I spend hours researching two comparable products to try to save $3.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Me too! I have also argued for hours with customer support to get $5/month off a bill (that's $60/year!), and I feel guilty every time I eat out or do something remotely luxurious, like getting fries with my $1 McChicken. Geez, even when I play video games, I <em>hate</em> spending the in-game currency. For me, it's obsessive-compulsive traits that cause it, but please note that I'm <em>not</em> claiming @Eddie has them. Just speaking for myself here, but I hope it helps. I still struggle with my miserliness, but I can share what works for me and what doesn't.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don't think I'm valuing my time nearly as much as I should.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Me neither, but knowing that doesn't help; it makes it worse. For me, putting a dollar amount on how much I value my time does <em>not</em> work because that just complicates the problem and amplifies how much time I spend solving that multi-variable optimization problem. Consider trying to convince Monk not to avoid germs in order to build antibodies; it just makes him think more about germs, raising anxiety and making easy decisions (use a handkerchief to touch doorknobs) into a hard decision (should I touch it or should I not?). It also amplifies the regret whenever you finally make a certain choice (""what if I did the calculation wrong?"" or ""what if I'm going to get sick tomorrow because I touched that doorknob?""). Making the problem more complicated isn't the solution.</p>

<p>So how to make it simpler? Make the decision ahead of time! For me, <strong>budgets</strong> are the key to reducing the anxiety associated with financial decision making. Every six months or so, my wife and I spend hours deciding how much to spend per month on things. We can really take our time analyzing it because we only have to do it occasionally. Once we set $50/month for restaurants, I no longer have to feel like a loser every time we eat out -- similarly for discretionary spending and everything else. TBH, I'm not sure exactly why it works -- why I don't regret the dollar amounts we put on every budget -- but it really does help. I join my coworkers for lunch on Fridays because I already decided that was okay. At that point, I can focus my OC-tendencies on eating every last gram of organic matter on my plate. Without directly touching the ketchup bottle, of course. :)</p>

<p>Again, just speaking for myself, but having budgets has done wonders for my stress level with respect to finances. <strong>For me, budgets are less about restricting my spending and more about permitting me to spend!</strong> It's not perfect, but it helps.</p>

"mutual fund types: value vs blend vs growth","14700","","<p>There are many types of mutual funds. Without considering specialty funds or other particular categories (EG emerging markets, real estate, etc), what's the difference between the following 3 types? What do they really mean for an beginner investor in terms of risk, return, or other factors?</p>

<ul>
<li>Value</li>
<li>Blend</li>
<li>Growth</li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you</p>
","<p>Value investing involves looking for companies that are ""cheap."" Cheapness can be determined by looking at statistics like price to book value, price to earnings, EBIDTA vs. Net Income, book value and many other ratios or by using valuation models such as the dividend discount model of John Burr Williams (nowadays known as Net Present Value analysis or Discounted Cash Flow analysis). The goal of value investing is to try to establish an ""intrinsic"" value for a company and buy companies that are selling for a <em>large</em> discount to their intrinsic value. </p>

<p>The ""large"" is important. If you can find a company that you think is worth $50 per share but it's selling for $25 per share, then it's selling at a 50% discount, which is big. If a $50 company is selling for $48, then that's still a discount, but not large enough. The idea is that valuation is rough so you want a large <em>margin of safety</em> so that even if you're not spot on, you're still guaranteed to make money. </p>

<p>Thus, value funds look for undervalued stocks and follow a buy and hold strategy.</p>

<p>Growth funds are essentially the opposite. Whereas value stocks are often out of favor and have <em>low</em> price to book values, growth stocks generally have <em>high</em> price to book and price to earnings ratios. The idea is that a growth company is growing very fast so you can justify paying a high multiple for it because it will grow a lot in the next few years and justify your investment. </p>

<p>Growth funds look for companies that are growing very fast and purchase those types of stocks. Growth companies are generally in favor with the market, while value companies are generally out of favor.</p>

<p>Blend involves a mixed strategy of some discounted value companies and some high-growth companies. These really aren't very common considering the specialization of mutual funds. </p>

<p>There is much debate about which strategy is truly effective in the long run, and I won't go into that here. </p>

<p>In terms of risk, growth funds tend to go up very fast but after they stabilize they tend to fall, and few managers can effectively pick the right growth stocks at the right time. Value funds tend to be not as volatile but they can have mediocre returns for a while (especially in bull markets) before having superior returns. </p>

<p>I would advise you to carefully study the purchasing history of managers of funds you're looking at. Oftentimes, ""value funds"" end up being ""value-pretender funds"" because the managers have fairly high turnover, which is uncommon in value funds. For growth funds, you want to look for managers who select companies <em>before</em> they become super hot and everyone jumps on. Those managers are hard to find and nobody does it consistently, but it's important to watch out for funds that simply buy what's hot and call themselves growth funds.</p>

"Why does gold have value?","14672","","<p>I'm curious about why is there so much financial interest and news coverage about gold.</p>

<p>It's hard to do things like buy food or pay the rent with gold, but I can do this with cash. Gold doesn't yield income like bonds. When I buy a corporate stock, I have faith that the company will grow, prosper, sell products, etc. and this will increase the value of my stock. Gold doesn't grow in value like a corporate stock.</p>

<p>So why does gold have such a high value? Why does the value of gold go up when gold itself doesn't produce anything? Why do people invest in gold? </p>

<p>I realize that this question might be viewed as provocative by some, but my intention is to ask this as a financial education question. I really do want to understand this ;)</p>
","<p>Gold's value starts with the fact that its supply is steady and by nature it's durable. In other words, the amount of gold traded each year (The <a href=""http://www.invest.gold.org/sites/en/why_gold/demand_and_supply/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Supply and Demand</a>) is small relative to the existing total stock. This acting as a bit of a throttle on its value, as does the high cost of mining. Mines will have yields that control whether it's profitable to run them. A mine may have a $600/oz production cost, in which case it's clear they should run full speed now with gold at $1200, but if it were below $650 or so, it may not be worth it. It also has a history that goes back millennia, it's valued because it always was.
John Maynard Keynes referred to gold as an archaic relic and I tend to agree. You are right, the topic is controversial.</p>

<p>For short periods, gold will provide a decent hedge, but no better than other financial instruments. We are now in an odd time, where the stock market is generally flat to where it was 10 years ago, and both cash or most commodities were a better choice. 
Look at sufficiently long periods of time, and gold fails. In my history, I graduated college in 1984, and in the summer of 82 played in the commodities market. Gold peaked at $850 or so. Now it's $1200. 50% over 30 years is hardly a storehouse of value now, is it?
Yet, I recall Aug 25, 1987 when the Dow peaked at 2750. No, I didn't call the top. But I did talk to a friend advising that I ignore the short term, at 25 with little invested, I only concerned myself with long term plans. The Dow crashed from there, but even today just over 18,000 the return has averaged 7.07% plus dividends. A lengthy tangent, but important to understand.</p>

<p>A gold fan will be able to produce his own observation, citing that some percent of one's holding in gold, adjusted to maintain a balanced allocation would create more positive returns than I claim. For a large enough portfolio that's otherwise well diversified, this may be true, just not something I choose to invest in. Last - if you wish to buy gold, avoid the hard metal. GLD trades as 1/10 oz of gold and has a tiny commission as it trades like a stock. The buy/sell on a 1oz gold piece will cost you 4-6%. That's no way to invest.</p>

<p>Update - 29 years after that lunch in 1987, the Dow was at 18448, a return of 6.78% CAGR plus dividends. Another 6 years since this question was asked and Gold hasn't moved, $1175, and 6 years' worth of fees, 2.4% if you buy the GLD ETF. From the '82 high of $850 to now (34 years), the return has a CAGR of .96%/yr or .56% after fees. To be fair, I picked a relative high, that $850. But I did the same choosing the pre-crash 2750 high on the Dow.  </p>

"Lump sum annuity distribution -- do I owe estate tax?","14651","","<p>I recently inherited an annuity, and I am considering taking a lump sum distribution. I thought I had the income tax situation sussed out, but then I stumbled across mention of a possible estate tax. Does estate tax apply to annuity distributions? If so, does it apply in <a href=""http://dor.myflorida.com/dor/taxes/estate_tax.html"" rel=""nofollow"">my home state</a> (where there is no state income tax) or in the home state of the decedent?</p>
","<p>There can be Federal estate tax as well as State estate tax due on an estate, but
it is not of direct concern to you. Estate taxes are paid by the estate of the decedent,
not by the beneficiaries, and so <em>you</em> do  not owe any estate tax. As a matter
of fact, <em>most</em> estates in the US do not pay Federal estate tax at all because
only the amount that exceeds the Federal exemption ($5.5M) is taxable, and
most estates are smaller. State estate taxes might be a different matter because 
while many states exempt exactly what the Federal Government does, others 
exempt different (usually smaller) amounts.
But in any case, estate taxes are not of concern to you except insofar
as what you inherit is reduced because the estate had to pay estate tax
before distributing the inheritances. As JoeTaxpayer's answer says more
succinctly, what you inherit is net of estate tax, if any.</p>

<p>What you receive as an inheritance is not taxable <em>income</em> to you either.
If you receive stock shares or other property, your <em>basis</em> is the
value of the property when you inherit it. Thus, if you sell at a later time,
you will have to pay taxes only on the <em>increase</em> in the value of the property
from the time you inherit it. The increase in value from the time the
decedent acquired the property till the date of death is not taxable income
to you.  Exceptions to all these favorable rules to you is the treatment
of Traditional IRAs, 401ks, pension plans etc that you inherit
that contain money on which the decedent
never paid income tax. Distributions from such inherited accounts are (mostly)
taxable income to you; any part of post-tax money such as nondeductible
contributions to Traditional IRAs that is included in the distribution is 
tax-free.</p>

<p>Annuities present another source of complications. For annuities
within IRAs, even the IRS throws up its hands at explaining things
to mere mortals who are foolhardy enough to delve into Pub 950,
saying in effect, talk to your tax advisor. For other annuities,
questions arise such as is this a tax-deferred annuity and
whether it was purchased
with pre-tax money or with post-tax money, etc.  One thing that
you <em>should</em> check out is whether it is beneficial to take a lump sum 
distribution or just collect the money as it is distributed in monthly,
quarterly, semi-annual, or annual payments. Annuities 
in particular have heavy <em>surrender charges</em> if they are terminated early
and the money taken as a lump sum instead of over time as the insurance 
company issuing the annuity had planned on happening.  So, taking
a lump sum would mean more income tax immediately due not just on the
lump sum but because the increase in AGI might reduce deductions for
medical expenses as well as reduce the overall amount of itemized
deductions that can be claimed, increase taxability of social security 
benefits, etc. You say that you have these angles sussed out, and so
I will merely re-iterate</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Beware the surrender charges.</p>

"What's the purpose of having separate checking and savings accounts?","14478","","<p>It's a simple question, but I'm having trouble finding an answer:</p>

<p>What's the purpose of having separate checking and savings accounts?  What benefits does it provide?</p>
","<p>For some people, it's easier to stick to a budget if they have separate checking and savings accounts because they can deposit funds directly into their savings account and not have those funds accessible by debit/credit card, checks, etc. This allows people to <a href=""http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/payyourselffirst.asp"">pay themselves first</a> and accumulate savings, while making it slightly more difficult to spend those savings on a whim.</p>

<hr>

<p>One a more technical/legal note, one key difference in the United States comes from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_D_%28FRB%29"">Regulation D</a>. §204.2(d)(2) of the law limits you to six withdrawals from savings and money market accounts. No such limit exists for checking accounts. Regulation D also forbids banks from paying interest on business checking accounts. </p>

<p>In the simplest case, checking accounts and savings accounts are a tradeoff between liquidity and return. Checking accounts are much more liquid, but won't necessarily earn interest, while savings accounts are less liquid because of the withdrawal limits, but earn interest.</p>

<p>Nowadays, however, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweep_account"">sweep accounts</a> blur this line somewhat because they function like checking accounts, in that you can write an unlimited number of checks, make an unlimited number of withdrawals, etc. but you can also earn interest on your account balance because some or all of the funds are ""swept"" into an investment account when not in use. The definition of ""in use"" can vary from business to business and bank to bank.</p>

Answers often focus not just on the potential for market downturns to affect your ability to liquidate assets, but even the 2-3 day delay in fund availability being a potential disaster.  However, I cannot think of any real-world situation in which this time sensitivity could actually be the case, and no answer that I've seen so far offers any examples.</p>

<p>A year after my bankruptcy in my much younger days I was approved for a credit card with no annual fee and a $3,000 limit.  Within a year I was at $10,000.  So if someone with bad credit, only 2 years post-bankruptcy, can attain $10,000 in unsecured credit, I imagine most anyone can.  As such, home repairs, car repairs, medical expenses, and most anything else can be put on credit for up to 30 days with no interest, which is far longer than is needed to liquidate any kind of stock or mutual fund.  And beyond $10,000 also pushes the limits of 3-6 months of salary for many.  Yes, I'm assuming that anyone with enough forethought to use an emergency fund would also have their credit cards completely paid off.</p>

<p>Assuming a credit card cannot be used, or for some reason cannot be attained, what sort of emergency requires payment up front for which 2-3 days processing of a stock sale would pose a problem?  Any home repairs and car repairs I've had done allow a few days for payment, or accept a personal check at the end of the job (which will often take 2-3 days).  All medical bills I've received appear after insurance has processed them, which can take 30 days or more.  Short of owing money to the mob, or a zombie apocalypse, what sort of emergency could require immediate liquidity of an emergency fund.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this question I wish to understand only the need for immediate liquidity.  Issues with market volatility are a separate discussion.</p>
","<p>I suppose this could really depend on the part of the world you're in, but there are still many instances of ""emergencies"" that need ""cash"". You have to decide how much cash is the right amount, but I still recommend having $1,000 or so in liquid cash. It can really make a huge difference. Let me give a few examples. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Bad weather. I live in Florida and after a hurricane if you want gas, food, or water, you're going to need cash. ATM networks are the last to get repaired. Same for internet. Cell services are not at the top of the list. You could be 4-5 days without access to your accounts. If you need anything in that time frame it's cash or the Red Cross.</p></li>
<li><p>Children. As a foster parent we keep some cash on hand because as kids come in to our care we want to get them in school right away. How are they going to eat? You can't give them your plastic, you haven't had time to setup ""lunch accounts"" or the like. Cash always works. Along those same lines are bus tickets, clothes, supplies and what not. Not everywhere will take an ATM card, and if your money is tied up in a stock then what are you supposed to do for 3 days? Tell your new kid that he can't eat?</p></li>
<li><p>Big Emergency problems. Like your car breaks down on the interstate. Sure it can get towed to the dealership, and yes they will add the tow to your bill, and sure you have a few days to pay it (while your car gets fixed), but how are you going to get around? Not all taxis take plastic around here.  Almost none of the busses take plastic even though they are supposed to.</p></li>
<li><p>Lost Wallet or ID theft. Lose your wallet, good luck getting into your bank accounts. It can take weeks to establish your ID after you lose it in some cases. You want your ID, but you need your birth certificate. You have to GO to the state of birth and request it. Oh but wait, to travel you need an ID. No problem send away for it, but wait, you need to send them money to mail it. To bad all your money is tied up. </p></li>
<li><p>Running or Evacuating - So you need to evacuate for some reason. No big deal. But all your money is in a place you can't get to it. How do you put gas in your car. Lets stick with it and say you get to ""cash out"" an account of some kind. Guess what, they're not going to mail it to some random address. Now you're stuck fighting support centers to get them to understand that you need your funds delivered to New York even though you live in Florida. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>In short, you don't need $100,000 in liquid funds, but there are a few cases that you need something liquid.</p>

<p>You also make a lot of assumptions. For example, not every one will have health insurance, or a heath problem that is covered by their insurance. Some serious home repairs are ""down payment"" upfront. Car problems like an accident that means you need a rental can totally be up front. Especially if credit cards can't be used.</p>

"Why does selling and then rebuying stock not lead to free money?","14349","","<p>From what I understand, stock prices go down when large amounts of the stock are sold (thereby lowering the price to attract buyers), and go up when large amounts are bought (vice versa - buyers rise the price to attract sells). </p>

<p>So why cant I make ""free money"" by simply selling my stake in a company at any price (thereby lowering the price), then instantly rebuying it at the new lower price, rinsing and repeating? Obviously at a small scale this difference would be negligible and overshadowed by commissions, but lets say I owned 10% stake.</p>
","<p>You are misunderstanding what makes the price of a stock go up and down.</p>

<p>Every time you sell a share of a stock, there is someone else that buys the stock.  So it is not accurate to say that stock prices go down when large amounts of the stock are sold, and up when large amounts of the stock are bought.  Every day, the amount of shares of a stock that are bought and sold are equal to each other, because in order to sell a share of stock, someone has to buy it.</p>

<p>Let me try to explain what actually happens to the price of a stock when you want to sell it.</p>

<p>Let's say that a particular stock is listed on the ticker at $100 a share currently.  All this means is that the last transaction that took place was for $100; someone sold their share to a buyer for $100.</p>

<p>Now let's say that you have a share of the stock you'd like to sell.  You are hoping to get $100 for your share.  There are 2 other people that also have a share that they want to sell.  However, there is only 1 person that wants to buy a share of stock, and he only wants to pay $99 for a share.  If none of you wants to sell lower than $100, then no shares get sold.  But if one of you agrees to sell at $99, then the sale takes place.  The ticker value of the stock is now $99 instead of $100.</p>

<p>Now let's say that there are 3 new people that have decided they want to buy a share of the stock.  They'd like to buy at $99, but you and the other person left with a share want to sell at $100.  Either one of the sellers will come down to $99 or one of the buyers will go up to $100.  This process will continue until everyone that wants to sell a share has sold, and everyone who wants to buy a share has bought.  In general, though, when there are more people that want to sell than buy, the price goes down, and when there are more people that want to buy than sell, the price goes up.</p>

<p>To answer your question, if your selling of the stock had caused the price to go down, it means that you would have gotten less money for your stock than if it had not gone down.  Likewise, if your buying the stock had caused it to go up, it just means that it would have cost you more to buy the stock.  It is just as likely that you would lose money doing this, rather than gain money.</p>

"Comparing HDHP vs PPO Plans: Am I missing something?","14264","","<p>It's that time of year at work that we're needing to renew our insurance carrier. HR decided to continue the two PPO plans we previously had available, while adding an HDHP + HSA plan. I've compared the two plans using <a href=""http://health-plan-compare.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">an online tool</a>, and to my surprise the HDHP seems to be better in all cases (except for a very tiny spot around $6000 of expenditures). How can this be? I would expect an HDHP to more risky, and therefore always include the possibility that you're out more money than with a ""safer"" plan. It's also worth noting that your total out of pocket expenses are always higher with our low deductible PPO than with the higher deductible PPO.</p>

<p>The following image shows data used for a family plan. I plugged in numbers for a single person, and there was a large area where the HSA was still cheaper than the PPO options (at approximately &lt; $5000 or > $10000). Am I missing something here, or is it truly better to use the HSA in almost every situation?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/S2sKt.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Here are the exact details of the plans.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PYH1s.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>There are a couple of things that are missing from the analysis.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The PPO plans feature a copay for doctors visits and prescriptions.  For example, if you need to see your doctor, under the PPO plans, you would pay $20 out-of-pocket.  Under the HDHP plan, you would pay the negotiated price for a doctors visit.  We don't know right now what this is, but let's say its $100.  (+1 for PPO: Most of the bills that you get will be less under the PPO plan than the HDHP plan.)</p></li>
<li><p>The HDHP plan allows you to open an HSA account.  You can then put money into the account that is deductible on your taxes, and you can withdraw that money for medical expenses.  This includes the doctors visit I mentioned above, meaning that a $100 doctor bill, payed out of your HSA, might only effectively cost you around $75 (or whatever your tax bracket is).  In addition, you can pay for things out of the HSA that are not covered by your insurance, such as dental visits, eyeglasses, chiropractic, etc. (+1 for HDHP: The HSA is a nice benefit if you have medical expenses that are not covered by insurance.)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In order to compare these and figure out what is best for you, you'll need to make some guesses and run the numbers.  Here is how you might do that.</p>

<p>First, let's compare the premiums that you would pay over a year (we'll assume family coverage, since those are the numbers that you provided):</p>

<ul>
<li>Plan A (PPO): $6144</li>
<li>Plan B (PPO): $4116</li>
<li>Plan C (HDHP): $2076</li>
</ul>

<p>So if you don't have any medical expenses for the entire year, Plan C is the clear winner.</p>

<p>Now, let's look at the opposite end of the spectrum.  Let's say that something big happens, and you are hospitalized for a while.  Here is where you might hit your out-of-pocket maximums.  Remember that with the HDHP, you can pay for your out-of-pocket expenses with an HSA, which means you can pay with money that was deducted with your income taxes.  We'll say you are in the 25% tax bracket for this discussion.  We'll also say that all your health care was in-network, for simplicity.  Here is the maximum you would pay, under each plan:</p>

<ul>
<li>Plan A (PPO): $6144 (premiums) + $6000 (out-of-pocket maximum) = $12,144</li>
<li>Plan B (PPO): $4116 (premiums) + $6000 (out-of-pocket maximum) = $10,116</li>
<li>Plan C (HDHP): $2076 (premiums) + $5000 * 75% (out-of-pocket maximum) = $5,826</li>
</ul>

<p>Clearly, at the high end, Plan C is also the winner.  In fact, with our 25% tax savings by using the HSA, the Plan C maximum is less than the Plan A premiums.</p>

<p>So what happens between these two extremes?</p>

<p>Let's now look at another scenario.  Let's say that you end up having a smaller procedure done over the next year (something without a copay), and your medical expenses have totaled $5,000.  Under the PPO plans, you have a smaller deductible, but you have to pay 20% of everything after that deductible.  With the HDHP plan, you have a high deductible, but after you've hit it, you don't need to pay another penny.</p>

<p>After we've paid our bills for the year, here is what we have paid under each plan:</p>

<ul>
<li>Plan A (PPO): $6144 (premiums) + $900 (deductible) + $4100 * 20% = $7,884</li>
<li>Plan B (PPO): $4116 (premiums) + $2400 (deductible) + $2600 * 20% = $7,036</li>
<li>Plan C (HDHP): $2076 (premiums) + $5000 * 75% (deductible) = $5,826</li>
</ul>

<p>Here you can see that Plan C is the winner again.  Any spending above this $5000 amount will get progressively worse for the PPO plans, since at this point, you are done paying with the HDHP plan, but you still have quite a ways to go with the PPO before you hit your out-of-pocket maximum.  And if you try a few things in the other direction, you'll quickly see that, due to the 25% tax savings enjoyed by the HSA user, Plan C wins with less expenses as well.</p>

<p>So far, we've seen Plan C win everything we've tried.  However, let's say that your family doesn't have any major health issues over the next year, but you have more normal medical expenses, which are covered by the PPO's copays.  Here are some assumptions I'll make for the discussion.  We'll say that we have a family of four, and each person ends up going to the doctor once, the dentist twice ($80 a visit), and let's say that someone in your family has a $30 a month prescription.  We'll also put you in the 25% tax bracket, and ignore state taxes.</p>

<p>For a PPO plan, the doctor visits are only $20 each.  (We'll put them at $100 each normally.)  The prescriptions will only cost you $22 with the PPO plan.  The dentist isn't covered by your insurance, so you'll need to pay that either way.  And don't forget that anything you pay out-of-pocket can be payed for out of your HSA, at a 25% tax savings.</p>

<p>With this situation, here is what you would pay for the year:</p>

<ul>
<li>Plan A (PPO): $6144 (premiums) + $80 (doctor) + $640 (dentist) + $264 (prescriptions) = $7,128 </li>
<li>Plan B (PPO): $4116 (premiums) + $80 (doctor) + $640 (dentist) + $264 (prescriptions) = $5,100</li>
<li>Plan C (HDHP): $2076 (premiums) + $400 * 75% (doctor) + $640 * 75% (dentist) + $360 * 75% (prescriptions) = $3,126</li>
</ul>

<p>Plan C wins again.</p>

<p>To be fair, there are scenarios where you would come out ahead with one of the PPO plans. (For example, a high prescription bill, as mentioned in <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/a/37241/10997"">@keshlam's answer</a>.)  If we take the dentist out of the equation, add some more doctor's office and ER visits, and hike up the prescriptions costs, we can get the PPO plan to look better.  You'll have to use your own numbers and figure out what will work for you.</p>

"How big of a mortgage can I realistically afford?","13946","","<p>I'm 25, and I'm in the process of closing on a <strong>$260,000</strong> mortgage for a very nice condo in downtown Salt Lake City. My salary is <strong>$80,000</strong> right now, which I feel is pretty solid, but I'm starting to get cold feet as I am a first-time homeowner and the amount of interest just seems devastating to me.</p>

<p>My question is, are my fears warranted, or am I just being paranoid? Reading a few finance articles, I have heard that most people can afford anywhere from 3-5 times their gross salary on a mortgage. Clearly, I am within that range, but there are also property taxes, HOA fees ($150 per month), and utilities to take into consideration. Another consideration is that I <em>do not</em> have much cash saved for a down-payment. I had a substantial sum, but family troubles combined with paying off my student loans ate up most of my savings.</p>

<p>Some other nuggets of information to aid in any advice/calculations:</p>

<ul>
<li>I've rented for the past 4 years; my current rent is $600 per month.</li>
<li>The condo is a 2-bedroom and I do have a roommate in mind. His monthly budget is $700 per month.</li>
<li>For the down-payment, I am considering taking a loan on my 401k. I can take up to 50% of the total balance with no penalties. The balance right now is around $25,000. Of course, if I do take a loan, that's another monthly bill I will have to pay.</li>
<li>I have <strong>$6,000</strong> in liquid cash, and the condo association has agreed to pay <strong>$7,500</strong> towards closing costs.</li>
<li>The interest rate I am looking at is <strong>4.625%</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Am I in a reasonable position, or am I setting myself up for being ""house-poor?""</p>

<p><strong>SIX MONTHS LATER:</strong></p>

<p>I appreciated all the good advice, and I figured I would give you an update and let you know how it all turned out.</p>

<p>Basically, I ended up pulling the trigger. Researching the economy in Salt Lake City made me feel quite optimistic and I was pretty much in love with the location, so I went ahead with it and even took out $12,000 from my 401k for the down-payment (coincidentally, the stock market plunged immediately afterward). Interest rates dropped to 4.375%. In addition, my roommate and I worked out a deal where he would pay 4 months rent upfront, so I was able to get $2,400 more to put into initial home-related expenses.</p>

<p>After a fairly drawn-out closing process, I finally moved in at the end of August. The property appraised for nearly $280,000, and is projected to increase to $300,000 over the next five years! The place is beautiful and such a step up from the dingy apartments I've been renting; I couldn't be happier with the decision. Here's some pictures to give you a feel for it.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nRWLa.jpg"" alt=""Kitchen"">

","<p>Let's start with income $80K. $6,667/mo. The 28/36 rule suggests you can pay up to $1867 for the mortgage payment, and $2400/mo total debt load. Payment on the full $260K is $1337, well within the numbers. The 401(k) loan for $12,500 will cost about $126/mo (I used 4% for 10 years, the limit for the loan to buy a house) but that will also take the mortgage number down a bit. 
The condo fee is low, and the numbers leave my only concern with the down payment. Have you talked to the bank? Most loans charge PMI if more than 80% loan to value (LTV).</p>

<p>An important point here - the 28/36 rule allows for 8% (or more ) to be ""other than house debt"" so in this case a $533 student loan payment wouldn't have impacted the ability to borrow. When looking for a mortgage, you really want to be free of most debt, but not to the point where you have no down payment. </p>

<p>PMI can be expensive when viewed that it's an expense to carry the top 15% or so of the mortgage. Try to avoid it, the idea of a split mortgage, 80% + 15% makes sense, even if the 15% portion is at a higher rate. Let us know what the bank is offering. </p>

<p>I like the idea of the roommate, if $700 is reasonable it makes the numbers even better. Does the roommate have access to a lump sum of money? $700*24 is $16,800. Tell him you'll discount the 2yrs rent to $15000 if he gives you it in advance. This is 10% which is a great return with rates so low. To you it's an extra 5% down.</p>

<p>By the way, the ratio of mortgage to income isn't fixed. Of the 28%, let's knock off 4% for tax/insurance, so a $100K earner will have $2167/mo for just the mortgage. At 6%, it will fund $361K, at 5%, $404K, at 4.5%, $427K. So, the range varies but is within your 3-5. Your ratio is below the low end, so again, I'd say the concern should be the payments, but the downpayment being so low. </p>

<p>By the way, taxes - If I recall correctly, Utah's state income tax is 5%, right? So about $4000 for you. Since the standard deduction on Federal taxes is $5800 this year, you probably don't itemize (unless you donate over $2K/yr, in which case, you do). This means that your mortgage interest and property tax are nearly all deductible. The combined interest and property tax will be about $17K, which in effect, will come off the top of your income. You'll start as if you made $63K or so. Can you live on that? </p>

"Pay off credit cards in one lump sum, or spread over a few months?","13802","","<p>I am doing a refi + cash out on a rental home. The cash out is to pay off ~24K in credit cards.

<p>Will the money you save by increasing your credit score (assuming this statement is true) be larger than by eliminating the interest payments for the credit card payments over ""a few months"" (13% APR at $24,000 is $3120 a year in interest; $260 a month, so if ""a few months"" is three, that would cost over $700 - note that as you pay more principal the overall amount of interest decreases, so the ""a year"" in interest could go down depending on the principal payments).</p>

<p>Also, on a related note regarding credit score, it doesn't look good to have more than a third of a credit line available balance exceeded (see number 2 here: <a href=""http://credit.about.com/od/buildingcredit/tp/building-good-credit.htm"">http://credit.about.com/od/buildingcredit/tp/building-good-credit.htm</a>).</p>

"What is the formula for the monthly payment on an adjustable rate mortgage?","13801","","<p>Can people tell me how monthly payments are calculated when a mortgage has an initial rate?</p>

<p>What is the formula?</p>

<p>I have seen online calculators but not formulae. </p>

<p>My guess is:</p>

<p>We assume that the principal amount paid off each month in the inital period is as if the mortgage has no initial rate, then the payment in the initial period is adjusted for the (often lower) initial rate interest. Is this correct?</p>

<p>For example, let's assume I have a 25 years mortgage, which is on 3% for first 5 years, then 4% on the remaining term. How do we calculate the payment?</p>
","<p>In an adjustable rate mortgage (ARM), the starting interest rate is guaranteed for a certain period.  After this period, the rate can go up or down.</p>

<p>The monthly payment on these loans is calculated as if the rate never changed over the life of the loan.  However, if the rate does change, the monthly payment also changes to cover the change in interest so that the mortgage is still paid off in the same amount of time.</p>

<p>Using your example, let's say that you have a 25-year mortgage that is a 5-year ARM.  The initial interest rate is 3%, which means that for the first 5 years, your rate is fixed at 3%.  The monthly payment for those first 5 years is the same as it would be if you had a 25-year fixed rate mortgage at 3%.  Here is the formula:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/EQghY.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/EQghY.png"" alt=""MathJax formula: $$P=L\frac{c(1+c)^n}{(1+c)^n-1}$$""></a></p>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
<li>P = monthly payment</li>
<li>L = Loan amount</li>
<li>c = monthly interest rate.  This is the annual interest rate divided by 12.</li>
<li>n = number of months in the loan (years * 12)</li>
</ul>

<p>In our example, if the loan is $100,000, the interest rate is 3% (monthly interest rate is 0.25%, or 0.0025), and the number of months is 300 (25 years), the monthly payment will be $474.21.</p>

<p>Now, 5 years into a 25 year mortgage, the <a href=""http://www.bankrate.com/calculators/mortgages/mortgage-calculator.aspx?loanAmount=100000&amp;years=25.000&amp;terms=300&amp;interestRate=3.000&amp;loanStartDate=14+Mar+2016&amp;show=true&amp;showRt=false&amp;prods=1&amp;monthlyAdditionalAmount=0&amp;yearlyAdditionalAmount=0&amp;yearlyPaymentMonth=+Mar+&amp;oneTimeAdditionalPayment=0&amp;oneTimeAdditionalPaymentInMY=+Apr+2016&amp;ic_id=mtg_calc_amortization_btn"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">amortization schedule</a> tells us that the remaining principal will be $85,505.48.</p>

<p>So if the rate jumps to 4% at that point in time, the monthly payment will be recalculated so that the loan is still paid off in the original 25-year time.  To find the new payment, use the above formula again, but this time L=$85,505.48, c=0.04/12=0.0033333, and n=20*12=240.  The new monthly payment is $518.15.</p>

<p>If, instead, you had a loan where the payment will be constant over the entire loan period, but the interest rate changes during the period (this is not common), there is a formula for that as well.  See <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/2207449/2600278"">this StackOverflow question</a> for the details.</p>

"What's the catch with biweekly mortgage payments?","13790","","<p>I just bought a house. Now I'm getting ads in the mail every day or two trying to get me to sign up to pay my mortgage bi-weekly (every two weeks) or weekly instead of monthly. In their words I could cut seven years and thousands of dollars off what I pay in long term. It seems like I would be paying the exact same amount of money, also.</p>

<p>I know ""if something sounds too good to be true then probably it is"". But I cannot figure out why in this case. What is the catch? Or is this something I should be signing up for ASAP?</p>
","<p>When you pay monthly, you're making 12 payments / year. Assuming you have a payment of $1000/mo, that's $12,000/year that you're paying for your mortgage.</p>

<p>When you opt for bi-weekly, they're saying that you can pay half of your mortgage ($500) bi-weekly (can be configured to align with your paycheck). Since there are ~26 bi-weekly periods in a year, you're making 26 * $500 = $13,000 in mortgage payments each year.</p>

<p>Some of these companies charge a fee for you to utilize this service. The main concept behind this is that people are horrible at budgeting on their own, so when $500 is immediately taken from your paycheck, you'll be able to budget around what's left and be able to make that extra payment each year without thinking about it or realizing it.</p>

<p>I asked him that my salary is 16k but why did you mentioned as 15232/- And he replied there is pf deduction from your basic salary of 12%. I wonder that the mentioned amount is 768 but the deducted amount is 1536. An he is saying that you can't check your PF balance until 6 months i don't know the reason Please let me know is my new company is doing some sort of scam or what ?is the deduction process is correct?</p>
","<p>There is no scam. Different companies have different salary break-ups.<br>
PF is calculated at 12% of Basic salary of the Employee and a match 12% contribution by Employer</p>

<p>This company when the offered you job and mentioned the salary as Rs 16,000/- it was the total cost to the company. Ideally they should have mentioned that your salary will be 15232/- and Employers contribution to PF is Rs 768/-. They reason they mention as Rs 16,000/- is because if other company had not opted for PF, and they offer you Rs 16,000/- both amounts are same.</p>

<p>Now that your salary is Rs 15232, the company contributed Rs 768/- to PF and an equal part is deducted from your salary and also contributed toward the PF fund, ie Rs 768/-. The employer's contribution of Rs 768 cannot be shown in salary slip as it is mandatory contribution by law.</p>

<p>So your PF will have a contribution of Rs 768 + 768 every month. The employer's portion is further split into Pension fund should be around (Say) Rs 68 in your case so your Pension Fund will looks like 768+700 and FPF fund will look like 68.</p>

<p>Don't worry having a PF is very good. Ensure that you keep track of PF's and transfer them on job changes.</p>

"Why is stock dilution legal?","13756","","<p>What I always heard, since I was a child, was that if you own a stock share, you actually own a small share of a company. That seems to be the general consensus of what a stock share is.</p>

<p>Well, that said, let's assume I have 10 out of 100 shares of a company. If that company issues another 100 shares, shouldn't 10 of those new 100 shares be mine? Apparently it is not, and my ownership of the company is halved. How can they take 5% of the company from me without paying its due value? Shouldn't it be illegal?</p>

<p>I am certain I have some misconceptions on how these things work. How is it really done?</p>
","<p>Here's another way that I look at it: </p>

<p>Say you and me were 50-50 partners in a small business. Suppose we wanted to expand our business but that needed money. Someone (let's call him Warren) has the money we need &amp; hence in return for the money we offer Warren an equal stake in the business. </p>

<p>i.e. All three of us own 33% stake now. For both you and me our stake reduced from  50% that it was before Warren's entry to only 33% now. </p>

<p>While that reduction in our share may seem at first sight a bad deal for us, we both agreed to give Warren his share consciously not out of altruism but because it made business sense to helps us expand. </p>

<p>Ergo, <strong>what matters is not just your share of the pie but the size of the pie</strong> itself! And hence dilution of stake can make sense under certain circumstances. </p>

<p>Two small points:</p>

<p>(a) This doesn't  in any way show the dilution <strong><em>must</em></strong> make sense. Only that it <strong><em>can sometimes</em></strong> make sense</p>

<p>(b) Of course, in the case of a large corporation they do not need your <strong><em>personal</em></strong> approval for the dilution. But hey, neither do they ask you when they buy a new plant or start a new product. </p>

"How do credit card balances relate to getting a Mortgage?","13754","","<p>My wife and I have been paying off debts since we got married about 3 years ago. We have about 15k left in credit card debt, 1 car loan, and 2 student loans (one is very negligible @ &lt; 4.5k). The original plan was to pay off all our credit card debt before getting a house, but we'd like to try to get a house 12-18 months. We're starting to put back money for a down payment (yes, I know my 1% interest is peanuts compared to what I'm paying to the credit card company) while also paying extra toward our balance.</p>

<p>In the process of paying off debts, we've paid off some really stupid ones (department store cards). So, now we have 8 paid off cards, and the one with the 15k balance. I'd read a while back that having low balances can be a red flag to lenders, as they fear that you might charge up your cards after getting a mortgage and not be able to pay the monthly payments. I'm thinking its fine to just close the 6 store cards that are paid off, but I'm unsure about what to do with the 2 credit cards. One is a high limit, is my oldest card, and has an annual fee. The other I am more comfortable keeping because it keeps a lower rate, no fee, and has a very small limit. Then there's also the issue of the 15k card, which is out of about 17k...so it's at high utilization. </p>

<p>We make about 104k per year, salary wise. What percentage of balance should I aim for on the remaining card, and how many of the paid off cards should I keep in order to be in great position for the best mortgage rates?</p>
","<p>The old underwriting standards were 28% home debt to income ratio and 33% consumer debt to income ratio. Consumer debt is calculated based on minimum payments. Now, most models are revised upwards... I believe 33/38 is more common today. </p>

<p>As long as you are current on the accounts, closing credit or store revolving accounts will have little or no bearing. Just leave them dormant... there is no positive result from closing accounts that have no balance.</p>

<p>Having low or no balances has <strong>NO</strong> negative impact on your credit score. Low balances are <em>NOT</em> red flags to lenders. Period.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.bankrate.com/finance/credit-cards/closing-credit-card-dings-credit-score-1.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">Here's a quote from Fair Issac</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It's just not true that you can have too much available credit. That by itself is never a negative with the score. Sometimes the things you do to get too much can be a problem, such as opening a bunch of new accounts, but for the most part, that's just kind of an old wives' tale.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>The major drivers of credit scoring are:</p>

<ul>
<li>On-time payment history</li>
<li>Length of credit history</li>
<li>Utilization of total unsecured credit lines. If you have $50,000 in credit lines and $45,000 in debt, you are in trouble. If you have $50,000 in credit lines and $0 in debt, you are in good shape.</li>
</ul>

<p>To improve your prospects for getting a mortgage, you should be reducing your spending and focusing 60/40 on saving for a down payment and paying down that $15k credit card, respectively. Having cash for a down payment is critical to your buying power, as zero-down loans aren't widely available in 2011, and a large downpayment will allow you to eliminate or reduce the time you are paying PMI. PMI reduces your buying power, and is a big waste of money.</p>

"Is it worth it to pay extra on mortgage payments if I am not planning to stay in the house for 30 years?","13597","","<p>So my wife and I are in the process of buying our first house.  It is a nice house, and we got a smoking deal on it.  However, we do not plan to live out the 30-year mortgage we are getting in this house (we think of it as a starter home).  I had heard that one prudent thing to do is to pay extra on your mortgage payments every month to pay down your principal, so that you will be paying less over the long run.  If we are only planning on being in this house for 5 to 7 years, is it worth the money to do this?</p>
","<p>You have a loan. You can probably assume you're going to have to repay that loan, every dollar. And every dollar that's outstanding on that loan costs you interest. So assuming you're not hit by any pre-payment penalty, any dollar that you pay down on your house right now saves you a compounded R% a year, where R is your mortgage rate.</p>

<p>It doesn't really matter whether you're planning to sell it in a few years or not. If you pay $N, you'll save the interest + $N taken from the sale price and sent to the bank when you sell the house and move (though you might get a tax deduction on the interest).</p>

<p>If you have a better place to park your money and earn a decent rate of return, it would be worth it to do that instead of paying down the mortgage. If you had another loan with higher interest rates, that's probably a better loan to pay off. If you can spend some of all of it on something that's actually genuinely worth R% of its purchase price a year (plus whatever the wear and tear takes away from its value, if anything) then spend it on that instead; that'd be a better investment. (For instance, investments in the stock market may offer better returns. However, that's <em>risky!</em> Observe that you can't lose money paying down your mortgage, and that Safety is usually relatively expensive these days, so it's not a bad deal. But if you're talking about using it for long-term retirement savings that are tax-advantaged to boot, that's another matter.)</p>

<p>If you already have ample emergency funds and were just planning on putting the money into a savings account to rot at ~1.35% <em>taxable</em> interest, it's definitely worth it to pay down your balance now, unless you're <em>about</em> to sell (so the savings are slight) and it's a real inconvenience.</p>

<p>If that company had 200 million shares issued, and were trading at a price of $4/share, then its market capitalization would be $800 million.</p>

<p>Does that mean the share is undervalued, because its market cap is only $800 million but yet by outsiders/a 3rd party transaction, one of its assets alone is worth $1 billion? Hence, the share price should be worth at least $5/share?  Else, what am I missing?</p>
","<p>You haven't mentioned <strong>how much debt</strong> your example company has. Rarely does a company not carry any kind of debt (credit facilities, outstanding bonds or debentures, accounts payable, etc.) Might it owe, for instance, $1B in outstanding loans or bonds?</p>

<p>Looking at debt too is critically important if you want to conduct the kind of analysis you're talking about.  Consider that the fundamental <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting_equation"">accounting equation</a> says:</p>

<p>Shareholders are <em>residual</em> claimants on the assets of the company, i.e. <em>after all debt claims have been satisfied</em>.

","<p>This may be a bit advanced now, but once you start really working and get a place, I think this will apply more...</p>

<p><strong><em>Do I set up a bank account now?</em></strong></p>

<p>Yes. There is no reason not to. As an adult you will be using this much more than you think. </p>

<p>Assuming you have a little money, you can walk in to any bank almost any day of the week and set up an account with them in very little time. Note that they may require you to be 18 if your parents won't be with you on the account. Otherwise, just ask any bank representative to help you do this.</p>

<p>Just to be clear, if you can get a credit union account over a typical bank account, this is a great idea. Credit unions provide exactly the same financial services as a normal bank, but typically have variety of advantages over banks.  </p>

<p><strong><em>Bank Account Parts</em></strong></p>

<p>Bank accounts typically have two parts, a checking account and a savings account. Your checking account typically is what you use for most day-to-day transactions and your savings account is generally used for, well, saving money. </p>

<p>Having a bank account often gives you the following advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>They give you an ability to store money without having large amounts of cash on hand.</strong> Once you start working regularly, you'll find you won't want to keep ~$600+ cash every two weeks in your wallet or apartment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>They help you pay bills.</strong> When you set up your bank account, you will likely be able to get a Visa debit card which will process like a regular credit card but simply deduct funds from your checking account. You can use this card online to pay utilities (i.e. electricity and water), general bills (e.g. your cell phone and cable), purchase items (ex. at Amazon) or use it in stores to pay in lieu of cash. </p>

<p>Be aware -- some banks will give you an ATM-only card before they send you the Visa debit card in the mail. This ATM-only card can only be used at ATMs as it's name implies. </p>

<p>Similarly, if you can invest about ~$200 to build your credit, you can often get a deposit secured credit card attached to your account (basically a credit card where the bank keeps your money in case you can't pay your bill). If you treat this card with responsibility, you can eventually transition to an unsecured credit card.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>They save you hassles when cashing your check.</strong> If you don't have a bank where you can cash your check (e.g. you don't have an account), you will likely be charged check cashing fees (usually by places such as grocery stores or payday loan chains, or even other banks). Furthermore, if your check is over a certain amount, some places may refuse to cash your check period and a bank may be your only option.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>They give you a way to receive money electronically.</strong> The most common example of this is direct deposit. Many employers will send your money directly to your bank account instead of requiring you to cash a check. If they are prompt, this money gets to you faster and saves you trouble (on payday, you'll just receive a pay stub detailing your wages and the amount deposited rather than a check). </p>

<p>Also, since you asked about taxes, you should know that when you do eventually file with the IRS, they have an option to receive your tax refund electronically as well (e.g. direct deposit into your bank account) and that can literally save you <em>months</em> in some cases depending on when you file your return and how many paper checks they have to process.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Does it cost money to setup?</em></strong></p>

<p>It depends. Some banks have special offers, some don't. Most places will set up an account for free, but may require a minimum deposit to open the account (typically $50-$100). The Visa debit card mentioned above generally comes free.</p>

<p>If you want a secured credit card as above, you will want about an additional $200 (so $250 - $300 total). Note that this is absolutely NOT required. You can exclusively use the Visa debit card above if you wish.</p>

<p><strong><em>Bank Account Fees</em></strong></p>

<p>Any fees charged when you have a bank account are usually minor anymore. Regardless, the bank will hand you a whole bunch of paperwork (mostly in legalese) detailing exactly how your account works. That said, the bank person helping set things up will cover what you need to know about keeping the account in plain English.</p>

<p>The most common types of fee associated with a bank account are monthly maintenance fees and overdraft fees, but these aren't always necessarily charged. Likewise, there may be some other fees associated with the account but these vary from bank to bank. </p>

<p><strong><em>Monthly Maintenance Fees</em></strong></p>

<p>To give some examples...</p>

<ul>
<li>Some banks may only charge a monthly maintenance fee if your balance goes below a minimum threshold (usually $25-$100).</li>
<li>Some banks may not care about a minimum balance but charge you a flat rate (e.g. $8.95 a month to keep the account open, regardless of balance).</li>
<li>Some banks may put additional conditions in place regarding monthly fees (e.g. no maintenance fee as long as you go online and do your banking via ATM and direct deposit -- but if you visit a teller one or more times in a month, they charge your account $10 for that month).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Overdraft Fees</em></strong></p>

<p>Overdraft fees are typically charged when you attempt to spend more money than you have in your bank account and the bank has to cover these charges. Overdraft fees typically apply to using paper checks (which it is unlikely you will be using), but not always. </p>

<p>That said, it is very unlikely you will be charged overdraft fees for three reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Many banks have done away with these fees in lieu of other ways of generating revenue.   </p></li>
<li><p>Banks that still charge these fees usually have ""overdraft protection"" options for a little more money a month, effectively negating the possibility you will be charged these fees. </p></li>
<li><p>The ability to deduct an amount of money from your checking account is now typically checked electronically before the payment is authorized. That is, using a Visa debit card, the card balance is checked immediately, and even when using paper check, most retailers have check scanning machines that do roughly the same thing.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>On a personal note, the bank that I have allows my account to be deducted below my checking account balance only if the payment is requested electronically (e.g. someone who has my card information charges me for a monthly service). In this case, the funds are simply listed in the negative and deducted from any amount I deposit till the proper amount is repaid (e.g. if I'm at -$25 dollars due to a charge when my account balance was $0 and then I deposit $100, my available balance will then be $75, not $100).</p>

<p>Finally, per the comment by @Thebluefish, while I minimize the likelihood you will be charged overdraft fees, it is good to check into the exact circumstances under which you might be charged unexpectedly by your bank. Read the documentation they give you carefully, including any mailed updates, and you'll reduce the chance of receiving a nasty surprise.</p>

<p>For reference, <a href=""https://www.bankofamerica.com/deposits/manage/faq-account-rates-fees.go"">here are some of the fees charged by Bank of America</a>.</p>

<p><strong><em>What about taxes?</em></strong></p>

<p>When you begin working, an employer will usually have you fill out a tax form such as a <a href=""http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw4.pdf"">W-4 Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate</a> so that your employer can withhold the correct federal income tax from your wages. If they don't, then it is your responsibility to calculate and file your own income taxes (if you are self-employed, an independent contractor or paid under the table). </p>

<p>If your employer is reputable, they will send you additional information (generally in February) you need to properly file your taxes prior to April 15th (the IRS tax deadline for most people). This additional information will likely be some variation of a <a href=""http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw2.pdf"">W-2 Wage and Tax Statement</a> or <em>possibly</em> a Form 1099-MISC. </p>

<p><strong><em>Do I have to worry about money in my bank account?</em></strong></p>

<p>Unless you have a significant amount in your bank savings account earning interest (see ""Should I save for the future?"" below), you won't have to pay any sort of tax on money in your bank account. If you do earn enough taxable interest, the bank will send you the proper forms to file your taxes.</p>

<p><strong><em>How do I file taxes?</em></strong></p>

<p>While it won't apply till next year, you will likely be able to fill out a <a href=""http://www.irs.gov/file_source/pub/irs-pdf/f1040ez.pdf"">Form 1040EZ Income Tax Return for Single and Joint Filers With No Dependents</a>, as long as you don't have any kids in the meantime. ;-) You will either mail in the paper form (available at your local IRS office, post office, public library, etc.) or file electronically. There will be a lot of information on how to do this when the time comes, so don't worry about details just yet. </p>

<p>Assuming your all paid up on your taxes (very likely unless you get a good paying job and take a lot of deductions throughout the year on your W-4), you'll probably get money back from the IRS when you file your tax return.</p>

<p>As I mentioned above, if you have a bank account, you can opt to have your refund money returned electronically and get it <em>much</em> sooner than if you didn't have a bank account (again, possibly saving you literal months of waiting).</p>

<p><strong><em>Should I save for my future? If so, how much? Any good articles?</em></strong></p>

<p>Yes, you should save for the future, and start as soon as possible. It's outside the scope of this answer, but listen to your Economics professor talk about compound interest. In short, the later you start saving, the less money you have when you retire. </p>

<p>Not that it makes much difference now, but you have to think that over 45 years of working (age 20-65), you likely have to have enough money for another 20+ years of <em>not</em> working (65-85+). So if you want $25,000 a year for retirement, you need to make ~$50,000 - $75,000 a year between your job and any financial instruments you have (savings account, stocks, bonds, CDs, mutual funds, IRAs, job retirement benefits, etc.)</p>

<p>Where you should stick money your money is a complicated question which you can investigate at length as you get older. Personally, though, I would recommend some combination of IRA (Individual Retirement Account), long term mutual funds, and some sort of savings bonds.</p>

<p>There is a metric ton of information regarding financial planning, but you can always read something like <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/047090545X"">Investing For Dummies</a> or you can try the Motley Fool's <a href=""http://www.fool.com/how-to-invest/index.aspx?source=ifltnvpnv0000001"">How To Invest</a> (online and highly recommended).</p>

<p><strong><em>But I'm Only 17...</em></strong></p>

<p>So what should you do <em>now</em>?</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Budget.</strong> Sounds dumb, but just look at your basic expenses and total them all up (rent, utilities, phone, cable, food, gas, other costs) and divide by two. Out of each paycheck, this is how much money you need to save not to go into debt. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Try to save a little each month</strong>. $50 - $100 a month is a good starting amount if you can swing it. You can always try to save more later.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Invest early.</strong> You may not get great returns, but you don't need much money to start investing. Often you can get started with as little as $20 - $100. You'll have to do research but it is possible.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Put money in your savings account</strong>. Checking accounts do not typically earn interest but money in savings accounts often do (that is, the bank will actually add money to your savings assuming you leave it in there long enough). Unfortunately, this rate of interest is only about 3.5% on average, which for most people means they don't get rich off it. You have to have a significant amount of money ($5,000+) to see even modest improvements in your savings account balance each month. But still, you may eventually get there. Get into the habit of putting money places that make you money in the long run.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Don't go into debt.</strong> Don't get payday loans, pawn items, or abuse credit cards. Besides wrecking your credit, even a small amount of debt ($500+) can be very hard to break out of if you don't have a great paying job and can even make you homeless (no rent means no apartment). </p>

<p>Remember, be financially responsible -- but assuming your parents aren't totally tight with money, don't be afraid to ask for cash when you really need it. This is a <em>much</em> better option than borrowing from some place that charges outrageous interest or making your payments late.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Have an emergency account.</strong> As already mentioned in another excellent answer, you <em>need</em> to have money to ""smooth things out"" when you encounter unexpected events (your employer has trouble with your check, you have to pay for some sort of repair bill, you use more gas in your car in a month than normal, etc.) Anywhere from $200 - $2000+ should do it, but ideally you should have <em>at least</em> enough to cover a month of basic expenses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Build good credit.</strong> Avoid the temptation to get a lot of credit cards, even if stores and banks are <em>dying</em> to give them to you. You really only need one to build good credit (preferably a secured one from your bank, as mentioned above). <strong><em>Never charge more than you can pay off in a single month.</em></strong> Charging, then paying that amount off before the due date on your next statement, will help your credit immensely. Likewise, pay attention to your rent, utilities and monthly services (cell phone, cable, etc.). Even though these seem like options you can put off (""Oh my electric bill is only $40? I'll pay that next month..."") late payments on all of these can negatively affect your credit score, which you will need later to get good loans and buy a house. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Get health insurance.</strong> Now that the Affordable Care Act (ACA a.k.a Obamacare) has been enacted, it is now simpler to get health insurance, and it is actually <em>required</em> you have some.</p>

<p>Hopefully, your employer will offer health coverage, you can find reasonably priced coverage on your own, or you live in a state with a health exchange. Even if you can't otherwise get/afford insurance, you may qualify for some sort of state coverage depending on income.</p>

<p>If you <em>don't</em> have some sort of health insurance (private or otherwise), the IRS can potentially fine you when you file your taxes. Not to be too scary, but the fine as currently proposed is jumping up to about $700 for individuals in 2016 or so. So... even if you don't grab health insurance (which you absolutely should), you need to save about $60 a month, even if just for the fine. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>This answer turned out a bit longer than intended, but hopefully it will help you a little bit. Welcome to the wonderful world of adult financial responsibility. :-) </p>

"What are the options for a 19-year-old college student who only has about $1000?","13535","","<p>I was basically wondering what options at the moment a poor student like me would have, if he wants to do his best to accumulate money?</p>

<p>I only have about ~$1000 in my savings account, and am a full-time student at University. I still have about two and a half years until I graduate (and start making money), but would like to use the best of my time, even before that point.</p>

<p>Any input is appreciated :)</p>

<p>*edit: any form of emergency fund is not really needed, since I attend University in the same town that my whole family lives in</p>
","<p>The ""$1000 is no money at all"" people are amusing me.</p>

<p>Way back in the mists of time, a very young me invested on the order of ~$500 in a struggling electronics manufacturer I had a fondness for. An emotional investment, not much money, but enough that I could get a feel for what it was like owning stock in something.</p>

<p>That stock's symbol was AAPL. This is admittedly a rare outcome, but $1000 invested over the long term isn't not worth doing. If for no other reason then when the OP has ""real"" money, he'll have X+$1000 invested rather than X, assuming 0% return, which I doubt. It's a small enough amount that there are special considerations, but it's a solid opportunity for learning how the market works, and making a little money.</p>

<p>Anyway, my advice to the OP is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>All of this assumes you have enough money to live on, and this $1000 is indeed ""play money"". If you need this money for books, rent, etc. put it in a savings account. Putting $1000 into the market, and then needing to tap high interest credit card debt to make ends meet is <em>losing</em> money.</li>
<li>Consider opening a Roth IRA. If you've already got the money, you've already been taxed on it, and as a non-working student, your tax rate is as low as its likely going to be.</li>
<li>Consider how much risk you're willing to shoulder. Are you alright with having $0 at the end of all this?</li>
<li>Take a look at index ETFs and mutual funds. While these don't have a spectacular return, at least recently, the market as of Fall 2011 is unusually highly correlated, which means it's unlikely that you'll do much worse or staggeringly better unless you're lucky. Pay special attention to commissions and expenses with these, as they can eat into your returns, which will admittedly be small. An $10 commission on a $10,000 investment is much less of a big deal than it is on a $1,000 investment. Some discount brokerages even have mutual funds that are themselves baskets of index funds (instant diversification), and if you're a client with them, these have low minimum investments and fairly small fees, which are properties you're looking for.</li>
<li>Which brings me to the last bit. Whatever you end up doing, <em>hold it</em>. Actively trading with as little money as you have will devour your returns with transaction fees.</li>

"Why call option price increases with higher volatility","13528","","<p>As per the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model"" rel=""nofollow"">BS model</a></p>

<p>the value of a call option is directly proportional to the volatility. Without getting into the derivation of the BS equation, is it possible to intuitively understand why this is so?</p>

<p>High volatility just means the underlying stock is volatile, it does not imply if the stock is going up and down. But call options should go up in price only when the underlying stock goes up in price. So how come high volatility always means a high price for call option?</p>
","<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model#Black.E2.80.93Scholes_formula"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The mathematics</a> make it easier to understand why this is the case.</p>

<p>Using very bad shorthand, <code>d1</code> and <code>d2</code> are inputs into <code>N()</code>, and <code>N()</code> can be expressed as the probability of the expected value or the most probable value which in this case is the discounted expected stock price at expiration.
<code>d1</code> has two <code>σ</code>s which is volatility in the numerator and one in the denominator.  Cancelling leaves one on top.  Calculating when it's infinity gives an <code>N()</code> of <code>1</code> for <code>S</code> and <code>0</code> for <code>K</code>, so the call is worth <code>S</code> and the put <code>PV(K)</code>.  At <code>0</code> for <code>σ</code>, it's the opposite.</p>

<p>More concise is that any mathematical moment be it variance which mostly influences volatility, mean which determines drift, or kurtosis which mostly influences skew are all uncertanties thus costs, so the higher they are, the higher the price of an option.</p>

<p>Economically speaking, uncertainties are costs.  Since costs raise prices, and volatility is an uncertainty, volatility raises prices.</p>

<p>It should be noted that BS <em>assumes</em> that prices are lognormally distributed.  They are not.  The closest distribution, currently, is the logVariance Gamma distribution.</p>

"What is the incentive for a bank to refinance a mortgage at a lower rate?","13499","","<p>I can't figure out why banks would actively try to get their customers to refinance their mortgage at a lower interest rate. And to be absolutely clear, I am talking about a bank refinancing a loan at their own bank (Wells Fargo refinancing a loan from Wells Fargo). What are their incentives?</p>

<p>I can think of only two:</p>

<ul>
<li>They make some money from the closing costs</li>
<li>It resets the amortization schedule so you are paying a higher percentage of your payment as interest</li>
</ul>

<p>But the difference isn't much when you may have only had the previous loan for a few years. And what's really confusing is that banks in the US right now are offering refinancing with no closing costs.</p>

<p>I would love to take advantage of one of these no-cost closing refinances but I'm afraid that I must be missing something big if the banks are trying to save <em>me</em> money. The crazy thing is that I can refinance my 30 year (of which I have 27 years to go) into a 20 year at a lower interest rate and pay almost the same amount per month. What am I missing?</p>

<p>This is a 30 year $402k fixed at 4.875% with 27 years left refinanced to 20 year fixed at 4.125%. Monthly payment goes from $2,206.80 to $2,474.74. How is this a good deal for Wells Fargo?</p>
","<p>In a lot of cases, the bank has already made their money. Shortly after you get your mortgage is sold to investors though the bank is still servicing it for a fee. Therefore, if you refinance, they get to sell it again.</p>

"How do credit cards, minimum payments, and interest work?","13461","","<p>I'm just starting out in my financial life and such, so I want to make sure I understand credit cards to avoid nasty surprises when I receive my bill.</p>

<p>I am starting to look at credit cards, and there are so many out there it is overwhelming. I have no clue what to even look for. I just want to know basically what I should look for in starting my credit.</p>

<p>Also, another question about paying back the bill. I do know you're basically borrowing money with a promise to repay it back. I do know I have to pay back monthly and there is a minimum limit, but what I am unsure is basically this... If I spent $1000 dollars for a month and my minimum is $10 dollars:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is there a recommended or a no incurring interest payment, like instead I pay $32 dollars and a interest penalty won't occur won't occur or does an interest always occur?</p></li>
<li><p>Do I incur interest before or after I make my payments?</p></li>
</ol>
","<p>Credit cards come with an interest-free grace period of ~25 days as long as you pay your balance in full every month. In other words, charges made in January will appear on a bill cut on Jan 31, and due around the 25th of February. If paid in full by 2/25, there's no interest. It is a very good idea to get in the habit of paying off your entire balance every month for this very reason.</p>

<p>Don't buy anything you can't afford to pay for at the end of the month when the credit card bill is due. You'll avoid interest charges, build good habits, and improve your credit score.</p>

<p>By just paying the minimum amount due, you'll be charged interest from the moment of purchase, and the grace period on new purchases goes away. Credit card companies make the minimum amount due relatively low as a way to encourage you to pay more and more in interest every month. Don't fall for it!</p>

<p>Look for a credit card with zero annual fee. Sure, rewards are nice, but it's more important to avoid fees, keep the interest rate low, and get in the habit of paying in full every month, in which case the interest rate won't matter.</p>

<p>Your bank or credit union is a good place to start looking.</p>

"Can a company block a specific person from buying its stock?","13457","","<p>Say there is a very rich, very unpopular individual. This individual wishes to buy millions of dollars in stock in a company he or she thinks will be successful. The company, however, realizes that by being associated with this person they will become vulnerable to certain political/social actions such as boycotts.</p>

<p>Can this company block said individual from purchasing the company's stock in the market?</p>
","<p>I assume you are talking about a publicly traded company listed on a major stock exchange and the buyer resides in the US. (Private companies and non-US locations can change the rules really a lot.)</p>

<p>The short answer is no, because the company does not own the stock, various investors do. Each investor has to make an individual decision to sell or not sell. But there are complications. If an entity buys more than about 10% of the company they have to file a declaration with the SEC. The limit can be higher if they file an assertion that they are buying it solely for investment and are not seeking control of the company. If they are seeking control of the company then more paperwork must be filed and if they want to buy the whole company they may be required to make a tender offer where they offer to buy any and all shares at a specific price. If the company being bought is a financial institution, then the buyer may have to declare as a bank holding company and more regulations apply. The company can advise shareholders not to take the tender offer, but they cannot forbid it.</p>

<p>So the short answer is, below 10% and for investment purposes only, it is cash and carry: Whoever has the cash gets to carry the stock away. Above that various regulations and declarations apply, but the company still does not have the power prevent the purchase in most circumstances. </p>

"Why does my bank suddenly need to know where my money comes from?","13428","","<p>Today I went to my brokerage acct for Wells Fargo and the page said that online trading was suspended.</p>

<p>So I called them and the rep said, ""we need to know where your money came from.""</p>

<p>This is an odd question: I've been with the bank for 15 years and the money in the accounts has been very slowly accumulated via direct-deposit paychecks over that time.  In fact, in order for <strong>me</strong> to determine where my funds came from, I have to look at <strong>their</strong> records.</p>

<p>After I explained this, they said the brokerage acct would be back online tomorrow.  But I'm left confused as to why in the world they need to do this to their customers.  Any ideas?</p>
","<p>Banks have a financial, and regulational duty called ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer"">Know your customer</a>"", established to avoid a number of historical problems occurring again, such as money laundering, terrorism financing, fraud, etc.</p>

<p>Thanks to the scale, and scope of the problem (millions of customers, billions of transactions a day), the way they're handling this usually involves fuzzy logics matching, looking for irregular patterns, problem escalation, and other warning signs. When exceeding some pre-set limit, these signal clues are then filtered, and passed on for human inspection.</p>

<p>Needless to say, these algorithms are not perfect, although, thanks to financial pressure, they are improving.</p>

<p>In order to understand why your trading account has been suspended, it's useful to look at the incentives: false positives -suspending your trade, and assuming you guilty until proven otherwise- could cost them merely your LTV (lifetime value of customer -how much your business brings in as profit); while false negatives -<em>not</em> catching you while engaging in activities listed above- might cost them multi-month investigations, penalties, and court. </p>

<p>Ultimately, this isn't against you.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I've been with the bank for 15 years and the money in the accounts has been very slowly accumulated via direct-deposit paychecks over that time.</p>

<p>From this I gather the most likely explanation, is that you've hit somekind of account threshold, that the average credit-happy customers usually do not exceed, which triggered a routine checkup.</p>

"What does the average log-return value of a stock mean?","13387","","<p>Assuming log-return is defined by the log of the price today divided by the price yesterday.</p>

<p>Does knowing this single piece of information (the average log-return of a stock over a long period of time), indicate something about the stock? Is this a commonly used indicator?</p>
","<p>Probably the best way to investigate this is to look at an example. First, as the commenters above have already said, the log-return from one period is log(price at time t/price at time t-1) which is approximately equal to the percentage change in the price from time t-1 to time t, <em>provided</em> that this percentage change is not big compared to the size of the price. (Note that you have to use the natural log, ie. log to the base e -- ln button on a calculator -- here.)</p>

<p>The main use of the log-return is that is a proxy for the percentage change in the price, which turns out to be mathematically convenient, for various reasons which have mostly already been mentioned in the comments.</p>

<p>But you already know this; your actual question is about the average log-return over a period of time. What does this indicate about the stock?</p>

<p>The answer is: if the stock price is not changing very much, then the average log-return is about equal to the average percentage change in the price, and is very easy and quick to calculate. But if the stock price is very volatile, then the average log-return can be wildly different to the average percentage change in the price.</p>

<p>Here is an example: the closing prices for Pitchfork Oil from last week's trading are: 10, 5, 12, 5, 10, 2, 15. The percentage changes are: -0.5, 1.4, -0.58, 1, -0.8, 6.5 (where -0.5 means -50%, etc.) The average percentage change is 1.17, or 117%. On the other hand, the log-returns for the same period are -0.69, 0.88, -0.88, 0.69, -1.6, 2, and the average log-return is about 0.068. If we used this as a proxy for the average percentage change in the price over the whole seven days, we would get 6.8% instead of 117%, which is wildly wrong. The reason why it is wrong is because the price fluctuated so much.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the closing prices for United Marshmallow over the same period are 10, 11, 12, 11, 12, 13, 15. The average percentage change from day to day is 0.073, and the average log-return is 0.068, so in this case the log-return is very close to the percentage change. And it has the advantage of being computable from just the first and last prices, because the properties of logarithms imply that it simplifies to (log(15)-log(10))/6. Notice that this is exactly the same as for Pitchfork Oil.</p>

<p>So one reason why you might be interested in the average log-return is that it gives a very quick way to estimate the average return, if the stock price is not changing very much.</p>

<p>Another, more subtle reason, is that it actually behaves better than the percentage return. When the price of Pitchfork jumps from 5 to 12 and then crashes back to 5 again, the percentage changes are +140% and -58%, for an average of +82%. That sounds good, but if you had bought it at 5, and then sold it at 5, you would actually have made 0% on your money. The log-returns for the same period do not have this disturbing property, because they do add up to 0%. </p>

<p>What's the real difference in this example? Well, if you had bought $1 worth of Pitchfork on Tuesday, when it was 5, and sold it on Wednesday, when it was 12, you would have made a profit of $1.40. If you had then bought another $1 on Wednesday and sold it on Thursday, you would have made a loss of $0.58. Overall, your profit would have been $0.82. This is what the average percentage return is calculating.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you had been a long-term investor who had bought on Tuesday and hung on until Thursday, then quoting an ""average return"" of 82% is highly misleading, because it in no way corresponds to the return of 0% which you actually got! </p>

<p>The moral is that it may be better to look at the log-returns if you are a buy-and-hold type of investor, because log-returns cancel out when prices fluctuate, whereas percentage changes in price do not. But the flip-side of this is that your average log-return over a period of time does not give you much information about what the prices have been doing, since it is just (log(final price) - log(initial price))/number of periods. Since it is so easy to calculate from the initial and final prices themselves, you commonly won't see it in the financial pages, as far as I know. </p>

<p>Finally, to answer your question: ""Does knowing this single piece of information indicate something about the stock?"", I would say: not really. From the point of view of this one indicator, Pitchfork Oil and United Marshmallow look like identical investments, when they are clearly not. Knowing the average log-return is exactly the same as knowing the ratio between the final and initial prices.</p>

<p>I’m not sure: can I back out after the inspection even if the inspector doesn’t find anything catastrophic? Do I have to proceed with the closing? I feel that the reasonable answer is, “No, I don’t have to.” However, in that case, the “as is” clause doesn’t make any sense to me. What’s the purpose of an “as is” clause if I can back out anyway? Okay, I can’t request any follow up fixes. But I presume the seller can also back out if she thinks that my requested follow up fixes are too much, right?</p>

<p>What legally binding responsibilities does the “as is” clause confer upon me?</p>
","<p>""As-is"" means that no matter what the inspector finds the seller will not delay closing, repair, or provide money/discount to repair.

No matter what they find, big or small, you will then have the opportunity to walk away.</p>

<p>If they find small things, then it is up to you. If they find any big things or open ended things then you will likely walk away. Don't let the seller, their agent, or your agent try and talk you out of the inspection.</p>

But you will need that inspection report to show that you tried to find all the defects. </p>

<p>Why does the seller go the ""as-is"" route? Some have something to hide. Others just want to speed the transaction along. If the defects are small, and you are able to handle the repairs yourself, then settlement can proceeded quickly. But if you insist on a new roof, then they have to schedule it and it can delay thing for weeks. Many times the seller is offering the house at a discount already and doesn't want to reduce the money even further.</p>

"Is Chase alone in restricting how much I can wire transfer, or do other banks also limit like this?","13290","","<p>My Chase account requires that the amount I wire (either international or domestic) should have been in my account for at least 10 days. Is this a requirement for all the banks or only for Chase?  Why might there be this kind of restriction?</p>

<p>The amount I am trying to wire is $20000.</p>
","<p>This is a reasonable requirement which many banks probably have. The reason is that after you deposit a check, ACH or direct deposit - they may be reversed after a couple of days (check bounced, payment canceled, etc). If you wire the money out, and then the check by which you got the money gets bounced - the bank is left hanging because money wired out is very hard to return. Wire transfers are generally irreversible unless its a mistake in the wire. </p>

<p>After 10 days, these transactions cannot be reversed and the money is bound to remain on the account, so you can wire it out.</p>

<p>By the way, it also goes for cashier's checks as well, I had a similar discussion with my banker (don't remember if it was WF or Chase) when I needed one based on a ACH transfer from my savings account elsewhere. They gave me the check, but said that its because I proved that the transfer was from my own account.</p>

"Is Pension Benefit Information (aboutmyletter.com) legitimate?","13282","","<p>I received a letter in the mail from a company called Pension Benefit Information saying that they had been engaged by my former employer to confirm my current mailing address because I have a balance in their 401(K) plan.  The only way they provide to confirm my address is to mail back a form they included with the letter.</p>

<p>They <em>seem</em> like a legitimate business, but it seems just phishy enough to make me double check.</p>

<p>My concern is that their BBB profile makes no mention of the URL included in the letter: <a href=""http://aboutmyletter.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aboutmyletter.com/</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Is this legit, or am I being scammed?</strong></p>

<hr>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>It turns out that this was legit.  My former employer uses this company to track down former employees and notify them that they have a balance left in their old retirement account.  Once I returned the form, I was contacted by my former employer.</p>
","<p>I have no personal knowledge of this company; I've only looked over what I found on the web.  Overall, my judgement is that Pension Benefit Information, Inc. of San Rafael, CA is likely legitimate and aboutmyletter.com is one of two sites run by them (the other being pbinfo.com).</p>

<p>These two sites are <a href=""http://www.networksolutions.com/whois-search/Aboutmyletter.com"">registered</a> to Pension Benefit Information, Inc. (aboutmyletter uses Network Solutions privacy service but gives the company name; pbinfo uses their name and San Rafael address.) They are in the BBB.  The president (of the 8 employee Co.), Susan McDonald, has <a href=""http://energycommerce.house.gov/108/Hearings/05112006hearing1871/McDonald.pdf"">testified (PDF on .gov site)</a> before Congress about business uses of SSNs.  They made a (very schlocky) video, which has an interview with McDonald after several canned, generic, ""impressive"" introductions.  I found the interview convincing of a person actually running a small, real business of this type.  A short version is on their site, <a href=""http://pensionbenefitinfo.heartbeatofamerica.tv/"">long version here</a>. There are some queries about their legitimacy online (like this one), but I found nothing negative on them, and <a href=""http://www.businessbun.com/q/is-pension-benefit-information-a-legitimate-company-4cc0188e36e03"">one somewhat positive</a>. <a href=""http://www.credit.com/blog/2006/01/pension_money_m/"">One article</a> talks about the suspicions they run into when contacting participants, and has some advice.  Also, scammers are unlikely to pay the U.S. Postal Service money to send paper letters.</p>

<p>So what are the dangers? Money or identity.  So don't pay them any fees (now or later), especially since it looks like their clients (retirement funds) pay on the other side.  As for identity information: What's in the letter?  Don't they show that they already know a bunch about you?  Old employer?  Maybe the last four digits of your SSN?  Your address (if this is not the forwarded-by-IRS type of contact letter).  Other things, maybe?  What information would you be giving up if you did respond to them fully?</p>

<p>You could try contacting your old company directly (mentioning PBI, Inc,), although on their website PBI says you'll have to go through them.  (They probably get paid for each successful contact, and deserve it.)  Still, responding through mail or telephone to PBI seems like the reasonable thing to do.</p>

"How are the ""Credit Card Payments"" categories supposed to work in the web version of YNAB?","13145","","<p>I am using the web version of <a href=""http://www.youneedabudget.com"">You Need a Budget (YNAB)</a> after previously using YNAB 3 and 4. One of the big changes to the web version of YNAB is that credit cards are handled differently, as <a href=""http://www.youneedabudget.com/learn/guide/transition-guide#credit-cards-get-their-own-section"">described in the YNAB 4 transition guide</a>.</p>

<p>The transition guide gives a story of going to buy a shirt, which you put on credit and have to pay back. It notes that you still need to pay it back, which comes later. That's all well and good.</p>

<p>However, I can't wrap my head around how I'm supposed to actually use the credit card categories in practice. Say that I have $0 on my credit card at the start of the month (so no debt). Over the course of a few weeks, I make 20 transactions from 15 of my YNAB categories and create a total debt of $500. I want to pay it back in full. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1GnHJ.png""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1GnHJ.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Now what? It seems like my options are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Go to each of those 15 budget categories and manually subtract the amount of money I spent, then add it to the ""Credit Card Payments"" category.</li>
<li>Budget ahead of time how much I think I'll pay to my credit card into the ""Credit Card Payments"" category, and then hope that how much I spend is under how much I budgeted. So if I thought I'd charge $600 for the month, but I only charge $500 for the month, then I have $100 roll over to next month.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first option seems too tedious, and the second option seems like it doesn't really reflect the reality of how credit cards work. So how is the ""Credit Card Payments"" category supposed to work in YNAB?</p>
","<p>I've been using YNAB4 for the last few years, and I like it so much that I haven't switched to the web version (new YNAB) yet.  However, I have played around with the web version a little, and here is what I have discovered.</p>

<p>Despite the different look of the credit card account and the lengthy dissertation on the credit card differences in the Transition Guide, credit cards are handled almost exactly the same in the new YNAB as they were in YNAB4.</p>

<p>You enter credit card spending transactions in the same way as YNAB4.  When you enter a transaction, money is pulled out of the budget category you select.  The only difference is that in YNAB4, this money was considered ""gone.""  Now, that money moves from your budget category into the new credit card category.</p>

<p>When it comes time to pay the credit card bill, you also enter this transaction in the same way as before.  It is entered as a transfer of money from your checking account to your credit card account.  The only difference here is that with new YNAB, the funds are deducted from your credit card category.  This is handled automatically, so you don't have to think about it if you don't want to.  </p>

<p>If you always pay your credit card bill in full, you never have to budget money manually into the credit card category.  The money will already be there from when you entered the credit card spending transactions.  The only time you would manually budget money into the credit card spending category is if you have old credit card debt that you are trying to pay off.</p>

<p>A quick example, in pictures:</p>

<p>I start out with $10,000 in my checking account, and no credit card debt:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dBNPP.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dBNPP.png"" alt=""initial account balances""></a></p>

<p>I've got all $10,000 in my ""Fun Money"" category:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CzVea.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CzVea.png"" alt=""Fun Money: $10,000""></a></p>

<p>Now, I spend $100 at the Store:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GoVhA.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GoVhA.png"" alt=""spend $100""></a></p>

<p>You can see that, just like in YNAB4, the credit card account is now in the red $100, and the checking account balance has not changed.</p>

<p>In the categories, my Fun Money category is down $100 to $9,900, just like it would be in YNAB4.  The only difference is that there is now $100 in the new Credit Card Payments category.
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/RLfYQ.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/RLfYQ.png"" alt=""category view after purchase""></a></p>

<p>When it is time to pay the bill, I enter an account transfer, just like in YNAB4:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lWa2s.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lWa2s.png"" alt=""pay credit card bill""></a></p>

<p>Note that the Credit Card balance is back to $0, and the Checking Account balance is now down to $9,900.</p>

<p>The Credit Card Payment budget category is now magically back to $0:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/RLCCt.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/RLCCt.png"" alt=""done!""></a></p>

<hr>

<p>The above example starts with a zero balance on the credit card.  However, most people will have a non-zero balance on their credit card when they first start a budget.  In YNAB4, when you added a credit card with a (negative) balance, the debt was shown in a budget category called ""Pre-YNAB Debt.""  You then added money to this budget category until it went to zero, and then you didn't need this budget category anymore.</p>

<p>With new YNAB, credit card balances are not shown in budget categories.  If you add a credit card account with a balance, the debt is not shown in the budget categories.  To pay off this debt, you can fund the Credit Card Payments category.  After this existing balance amount is paid off, you won't need to fund the Credit Card Payments category anymore as long as you properly assign each new credit card purchase to a funded budget category.</p>

"Is there a ""catch"" on my ""increased credit limit""?","13097","","<p>Today I received a letter from the bank that issued my credit card. Basically it says that, since I'm ""one of their best customers"" my credit (card) limit has been increased.</p>

<p>This is the second time that they have done this. The first time I didn't give it much thought. I'm a legal resident in the United States, so I knew that I would need to build a ""credit history"" for myself here and I though that it was a good sign that they would increase my credit limit after a couple years. </p>

<p>After this happened the second time, I wonder if there could be a ""catch"" on this. I mean, what is my bank's <em>real</em> motivation for allowing me to spend more money. Are the any <em>pitfalls</em> (besides the obvious ""don't get into too much debt. Don't buy things that you cannot really afford"") I should avoid?</p>

<p>Additional info:</p>

<ul>
<li>I'm a legal resident in the US. </li>
<li>I have had this credit card for around 4 years now.</li>
<li>I make a sensible use of my card. I never had an issue paying my balance.</li>
</ul>
","<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I mean, what is my bank's real motivation for allowing me to spend more money. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Credit card companies make money in a few ways.</p>

<ol>
<li>Whenever you buy something on the card they get a cut of the merchant fees, the more you buy on the card the more money they make.</li>
<li>When people buy stuff and don't pay it off immediately they generally (the exception being promotional deals) get to charge interest. Often at a very high rate.</li>
<li>When people miss payments they get to charge them fees and take away any promotional deals.</li>
</ol>

<p>By giving you a higher limit the credit card company hopes you will spend more on the card. This immediately gets them more merchant fees and if they are lucky means you will have to carry the balance for a while earning them interest. If they get really lucky you will miss a payment or two earning them some fees.</p>

<p>Of course if they let you borrow too much you might never pay it back.</p>

<p>So the credit limit is a balancing act. Letting you borrow more money gives them the potential to make more money but also the potential to lose more money. As you build up a history of paying as agreed they feel comfortable lending you more money.</p>

"Why does a stock price drop as soon an I purchase several thousand shares at market price?","13063","","<p>I have at times bought thousands of shares of a stock but every time it seems the share price dips right after my purchase. Is this just bad luck or part of the process?</p>
","<p>Any time a large order it placed for Buy, the sell side starts increasing as the demand of Buy has gone up. [Vice Versa is also true].</p>

<p>Once this orders gets fulfilled, the demand drops and hence the Sell price should also lower. Depending on how much was the demand / supply without your order, the price fluctuation would vary. For examply if before your order, for this particular share the normal volume is around 100's of shares then you order would spike things up quite a bit. However if for other share the normal volume is around 100000's then your order would not have much impact.</p>

"What kind of credit card transactions generally count as a cash advance?","13060","","<p>I understand that if I use my credit card to get cash from an ATM, that counts as a 'cash advance'.</p>

<p>Are there any other credit cards transactions that don't involve taking cash from ATM that count as a cash advance? e.g certain forms of online bill payment or funding a PayPal account with credit card?</p>
","<p>Generally when you get cash - it is considered cash advance. So ATM, casinos, currency-exchange places, buying travelers' checks, and money transfer/check cashing agencies are the standard suspects in that regard. Funding paypal account may also be considered as cash advance, and in some cases - buying gift cards (depending on the merchant and type of gift card).</p>

<p>There are several reasons for this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Cash cannot be recovered. Once you got cash - no-one can chase you to take it back. So it is a much higher risk - they may end up absorbing fraud activities if the merchant can prove to have done the due diligence (which most of them do).</p></li>
<li><p>It is also a higher cost to the companies - they need to pay it to the merchant faster. Usual purchases may end up in the merchant processor's pocket for significant amounts of time (I know of some cases where it can be 30 days), but not so for cash advances. It also adds to the risk - since even if a charge-back is successful, the money has already left the building and will have to be recovered.</p></li>
<li><p>Because they can. People who use credit cards for cash advances are usually either desperate or financially illiterate (and in many cases - both). If the companies can earn money for the service - why not?</p></li>

<p>Will accepting an offer like this have a negative impact on my credit score, such as a hard pull, or on my ability to obtain credit in the future?  To put it another way, are there any reasons I shouldn't accept it?</p>

<p>Edit: I went ahead and accepted it, and the form assured me, ""We did not pull a credit bureau report during the evaluation process.""  If a hard pull does end up showing up I'll be sure to say so.</p>
","<p>Yes, they will probably do an hard pull (inquiry). This will hurt your score a bit. In about 12 months that effect will be mostly reduced and after 2 years it will be totally gone. How much of an effect this will have depends on what your credit score is now, how many other inquiries you've had recently and have in the near future, etc.</p>

<p>If they approve the increase, that will probably improve your score. It will increase your total credit available and thus decrease your utilization. This is true if you either carry a balance, or use credit cards regularly, even if you pay the balance every month. How much of an effect this has depends on your current utilization ratio.</p>

<p>Whether this is a net positive or negative for your score depends on which of these effects ends up stronger. Also, the utilization effect will last indefinitely, while the inquiry effect will fade away, so if you don't expect to need credit in the next 12 months, but your score could use a boost, it might be worth trying.</p>

"Should I sign the back of my credit card?","12941","","<p>When getting a new credit card, what is the policy in regards to signing the strip on the back? Should I sign it? Should I write ""See ID""? Should I leave it blank? Should I sign it AND write ""See ID""? </p>

<p>I see all sorts of different advice but it seems like it's all based on urban legends, hearsay, or self interest (merchants and banks seem to advise you to do what's best for them, not what's best for the customer).</p>

<p>My question: For an average everyday consumer who uses a card fairly frequently, what is the best practice? What practice is most secure?</p>
","<p>I have had a card signed as ""asked for ID"", and it didn't make any merchant ask for ID. In fact, it didn't have any positive effect whatsoever. Most merchants don't even try to match the signature, and most credit card issuers know that it's worthless.</p>

<p>I was however once asked to sign a card that I didn't sign at all, and the seller said that he's not allowed to sell to me unless I do. He did ask for my ID as well.</p>

<p>As Joe said, signing the card is obligatory, but the signature itself is meaningless. It is supposed to be the proof that you're the owner and match the signature sample the issuer has, but I know of at least two issuers whose cards I have in my wallet where I applied for the card electronically and was not asked (and didn't provide) any signature sample at all. </p>

<p>Merchants who want to make sure that you're indeed the owner of the card will not rely on the signature, they'll ask for ID. Those who don't - assume the risk, if the card is stolen and used by someone who's not the owner.</p>

However, they recommend ""secure and trackable"" shipping for the low-low price of only $8.40. Is that just a sneaky way of making my free checking really not free? Should I be afraid of doing the no frills snail shipping method that is actually $0.00? I'm not in any hurry, but I also don't want to have to do stop payments on several hundred checks.</p>
","<p>Having seen the process of reporting and dealing with stolen checks I would pay the fee and, very truthfully, I would do everything in my power to avoid getting checks at all.  Many of the banks now offer online interfaces that allow you to provide the payee information and they will send a printed check on your behalf, which is much much safer.</p>

<p>If someone steals a book of your checks multiple things have to be done and the process is ongoing and painful.  This is by no means a complete list, but it shows how painful this can be.</p>

<ul>
<li>Close the bank account (And change and direct deposit or autopay setups)</li>
<li>Report to ChexSystems (reporting agency for checking accounts)</li>
<li>Fill out a fraud report for <strong>every</strong> stolen check that gets used</li>
<li>Fill out a fraud report for <strong>every</strong> bad check of someone else's that gets logged against your account</li>
</ul>

<p>We closed the bank account within 15 minutes of the checks being stolen and still multiple checks got through, both written directly against the account as well as the thieves cashing other people's stolen checks against the account since they new the account number.  Several times they were able to do this within the bank, even though the account had already been closed so it's a major problem if your checks disappear, and if you don't have a way to track them then you'll be very late in realizing that they're stolen.</p>

<p>Additionally this bank (not sure if this is common with others) insisted on paying the stolen money back into the closed account, instead of into a new account.  This allowed the thieves to steal the same money several times over, forcing us through the weeks long process of reporting the fraud and dealing with the bank's fraud investigators again.</p>

"How do I know when I am financially stable/ready to move out on my own?","12866","","<p><strong>Some background information:</strong></p>

<p>I'm 23 and living at home.  I have a good full time job as a web programmer that I've been at for over one year.  It includes benefits and 401K (which after one year I now get to contribute to.  I'm giving 5%/paycheck to the 401K).</p>

<p>Within the first year, I paid off all of my colleges loans in my name (my parents have the other half).  I have no other debts.  I have one credit card that I pay off on time every month (I purchase everything with it and never spend more than I have).</p>

<p>Since I live at home my bills are very minimal.  I pay for half of a cellphone bill with my parents, pay for my food and gas (I travel half an hour to work, one way, every day), other smaller bills (webhosting, Netflix, etc.) and I contribute to my loans in my parents' names (which should be paid off within a year).</p>

<p>Right now I'm trying to save up 6 months worth of pay for my emergency fund.  I'm projecting that I'll achieve that goal within a year (hopefully less).</p>

<p>After that I only have two other financial goals:</p>

<ul>
<li>Getting a newer car (I currently have a 98 Mustang which is OK, but showing its age)</li>
<li>Moving out into my own place</li>
</ul>

<li>When do I know that I'm financially stable to move out?  Should I wait until both my emergency fund is at least 6 months of pay and my loans in my parents' names is paid off (to free up money)?  </li>
<li>When should I factor in the newer car investment?  How much should I have set aside for the car?  </li>
<li>Should I get an apartment for a couple years before looking for my own house?  How much should I set aside for either investment (apartment vs  house)?</li>
<li>Is there anything else I should be doing/taking advantage of with my money during this ""living at home"" period before I finally leave the nest?</li>
</ul>
","<p>One big deciding factor will be what standard of living you want to maintain once you move out.  Your parents have had years to get raises, accumulate savings, and establish the standard of living you are used to.  </p>

<p>Regardless of how much you save up now, you'll still have to be living at or below your means once you move out, that means that all the expenses you currently have covered by your parents have to come out of something you are currently spending elsewhere.  If they can come out of whatever extra money you have now, then great.  If not, you'll have to re-align your budget to align with your income.</p>

<p>In my experience, seeing my friends and I move out, this was the biggest issue.  Those who settled into a new standard of living until their wages went up did fine (even the few who moved out at 18 with no savings).  Those who couldn't drop the extra expenses, and wanted to continue living at their parent's standard of living either never left home, ended up moving back, or ended up massively in debt.  We're only just hitting 30 now, so it didn't take long for things to settle out.</p>

"In a competitive market, why is movie theater popcorn expensive?","12767","","<p>I have seen some arguments claim that movie theater popcorn is expensive because the theater acts as a monopolist. However, this is only true after I have paid for a movie ticket. Before entering the theater I can choose among theaters and compare the opportunity costs of my movie-going experience (which would include the utility of consuming popcorn after its cost).</p>

<p>So why do movie theaters have popcorn prices substantially higher than marginal cost in a competitive market? I believe Steven Landsburg analyzed this in one of his Armchair Economist books in case anyone has that handy...</p>
","<p>One explanation is that movie patrons are considering their total willingness to pay for the movie experience so that if the ticket price plus the market price of popcorn is less than their <em>willingness to pay</em> (WTP), the theater has an opportunity to extract more consumer surplus by charging higher than market prices for the popcorn (that is, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_discrimination"">price discrimination</a>).</p>

<p>There is a working paper on the subject by <a href=""http://faculty-gsb.stanford.edu/hartmann/MeteringConcessions.pdf"">Gill and Hartmann (2008)</a>, the abstract of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Prices for goods such as blades for razors, ink for printers and concessions at movies are often 
  set well above cost.  Theory has shown that this could yield  a profitable price discrimination 
  strategy often termed “metering.”  The idea is that a customer’s intensity of demand for 
  aftermarket goods (e.g. the concessions) provides a meter of how much the customer is willing to 
  pay for the primary good (e.g. admission).  If this correlation in tastes for the two goods is 
  positive, a high price on the aftermarket good allows firms to extract a greater total price 
  (admissions plus concessions) from higher type  customers.  This paper develops a simple 
  aggregate model of discrete-continuous demand to motivate how this correlation can be tested 
  using simple regression techniques and readily available firm data.  Model simulations illustrate 
  that the regressions can be used to predict whether aftermarket prices should be above, below or 
  equal to their marginal cost.  We then apply the approach to box-office and concession data from 
  a chain of Spanish theaters and find that high priced concessions do extract more surplus from 
  customers with a greater willingness to pay for the admission ticket. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://www.jstor.org/stable/2138630"">Locay and Rodriquez (1992)</a> make a similar argument in a JPE article.  They essentially argue that purchases of things like movie tickets are made by groups; once individuals are constrained by the group's choice, the firm has additional market power:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We present models in which price discrimination in the context of  a
  two-part price can occur in some competitive markets. Purchases  take
  place in groups, which choose which firms to patronize. While  firms
  are perfectly competitive with respect to  groups, they have  some
  market power over individual consumers, who are constrained  by their
  groups' choices. We find that firms will charge an entry fee  that is 
  below marginal cost,  and  the  second part of  the  price is  marked
  up  above marginal cost. The  markup not only is positive  but
  increases with the quality of the product.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The quote you are looking for is similar, and again attributes the discrepancy to price discrimination.  From the Armchair Economist (p. 159):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The purpose of expensive popcorn is not to extract a lot of money from
  customers. That purpose would be better served by cheap popcorn and
  expensive movie tickets. Instead, the purpose of expensive popcorn is
  to extract different sums from  different customers. Popcorn lovers,
  who have more fun at the movies, pay more for their additional
  pleasure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is, some people like popcorn more than others.  The latter idea is that the movie experience for popcorn lovers is worth more than the sum of its parts: that a movie ticket + popcorn is worth more than either of them separately for some people.</p>

"I earn $75K, have $30K in savings, no debt, rent from my parents who are losing their home. Should I buy a home now or save?","12734","","<p>My parents have advised me to buy a home, as residential real-estate is still ""cheap"" (or what's considered cheap in my area). My parents have valid points, especially from an economic/investing perspective. However, I really do NOT want to rush into a huge wall of debt prematurely. Also, my parents may want me to have a house in case we can't save the one we (my mom and brothers) all live in.</p>

<p>I am 26 years of age. I have a stable career and have been employed since before graduation. I recently completed my degree debt-free and just pay rent, auto insurance (no car payment), gas and food. I earn about $75,000 per year.</p>

<p>I have 2/3 of my cash in a 0.23% APY Money Market account at a local credit union, and the rest in a regular checking account. I also have about $10,000 in a 401k to which I contribute 5% of my paycheck, but I'm not fully vested yet so my employer still owns half for a few more years since they matched it.</p>

<p>I pre-qualified for an ~4% APR, no closing costs, $3000 down, max $1000/mo ($160,000) mortgage from N.A.C.A. However, I feel uneasy about it since most houses I am looking at would require me to buy down the APR points so that the mortgage amount actually reaches the purchase prices, which are around $180,000 - $200,000.</p>

<p>Is this a bad investment idea for me at this time? My parents say I should look at it as an investment, not as being tied down. If it's an investment just for me to build equity and I can sell the house later if I want to, why would I want to spend lots of money buying down points? Should I wait and save more money for a down payment, closer to 20% to avoid PMI etc.?</p>
","<p>The biggest red flag is the fact that your parents may lose their house.</p>

<p>There are multiple parts of the decision. </p>

<ul>

<li>Economically does it make sense based on the local economy and housing prices to buy now in that market?</li>
</ul>

<p>The red flag comes in because you are stretching your finances to the max to afford the house you are interested in. Buying down the interest rate makes some sense depending on how long you plan on staying, but not a a way to afford house X.  Of course a bigger down payment will also influence the size of the house.</p>

<p>You are also buying something in case your parents need a place to live. What happens if that never occurs? You now have something bigger than you need.</p>

<p>You are mixing investments and housing. There is no guarantee that you will even break-even on the house as a investment. It can take several years to make back the closing costs involved in buying and selling a house, based solely on stable price and your monthly payments.

"Why has bitcoin gained so much in the past year?","12713","","<p>Over the past year, the value of bitcoin has gone from 1030.82 USD on 3 Jan 2017 to 10755.89 USD today. That's a price increase of 1000%. I'm only an amateur investor, but in my mind that increase is <em>astounding</em>.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2Cqqr.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2Cqqr.png"" alt=""graph""></a></p>

<p>I've got a couple of non-digital currency investments and I'd be happy to get a 10% return on my money. These kinds of gains are claimed by scam artists; If I didn't know bitcoin, I'd think this was a scam. This sets off red-flags in my head. It's too good to be true, which means I'm misunderstanding exactly where these gains come from and what they represent. For example, where did all this money come from? It can't just come from nowhere!</p>

<p>So, why has bitcoin performed so well over the past year? Why has it gained so much so quickly? What's the downside to all this? There must be one?!</p>
","<p>Market cap doesn't mean that much money went into the system. Money in equals money out over time, and is not directly tied to market cap, which can actually be lower if price drops far enough. These concepts are the same for all traded assets, such as stocks, bonds, and commodities.</p>

<p><em>""Market cap""</em> is simply the current price times the number of shares available in the market. So a $300 billion market cap does not mean $300 billion was paid to somebody to buy it all. Instead, what's happened is that some money went in at first, but much much less, and then price increased. </p>

<p>Bitcoin is a little different in that ""money in"" for many innovators and early adopters was in the form of time spent and contributing to the network (what they call mining). <sup>1</sup></p>

<p>Now, as to the price jump, that's an effect of market forces. For many reasons, the market has clamored to buy bitcoin over the last year <sup>2</sup>, but many already holding bitcoin weren't ready to sell. Supply and demand worked in a way that increased price. Supply low, demand high, price increases. </p>

<p>This situation could easily reverse. Just as suddenly as the market wanted bitcoin it can decide it doesn't want bitcoin. Supply and demand would work in a way that would decrease price. Supply high, demand low, price decreases. </p>

<p>This kind of massive market price movement in this short timeframe is exactly what traders mean by <em>""volatile""</em>. It's actually not that unusual, it's just that most stocks and other assets that experience such gains don't get much media attention. Further, gains like this often reflect <em>""inflated""</em> prices, market <em>""euphoria""</em>, and trading <em>""bubbles""</em>. All of these terms essentially mean ""price will correct (go down) eventually, because price is currently much higher than actual value"". </p>

<p>If the market loses all faith in the asset, price will drop to zero and the ""money in equals money out"" maxim breaks down. Some traders will be left <em>""holding the bag""</em>,  meaning they owned the stock at the moment trading permanently ceased. <sup>3</sup></p>

<hr>

<p>NOTES:</p>

<ol>
<li>This early contribution was mostly driven by people with a vision for bitcoin, not traders hoping to profit. This may in fact be a major reason that supply has been so low, meaning, current holders don't want to sell. Many early ""bitcoiners"" believe bitcoin will serve a higher purpose and want to remain active in the community. Selling off your bitcoin represents an exiting from that vision and community.</li>
<li><p>Exact reasons cannot be pinpointed with facts. Instead, we enter the realm of opinion on this point. In my opinion, bitcoin has increased massively in value mostly due to the media attention it has received. And this media attention is not new. It received equally pervasive attention in 2013. As an effect, price went from under $100 to over $1000 back to under $200 in about 20 months. It's great news if you're a trader. You could have made tons of money. As for the early bitcoiners, it was actually kind of annoying because it then brought in all the skeptics calling it a ""ponzi"" scheme or ""pyramid"" scheme, despite the quite obvious fact that bitcoin cannot be either by definition.</p>

<p>Further upward market forces may have come from the fact that bitcoin is built on an innovative technology that may very well change the way we do a lot of things in the future. I'm referring to <em>""blockchain""</em>. This effect can be seen in several failing companies rising from the darkness like Valkrie simply by adding the work blockchain to their name. I personally find this exactly analogous to the ""dot com bubble"", where companies in the late 1990's made millions in stock selloffs simply by adding "".com"" to their name, despite having no profits or sometimes not even a working product.</p></li>
<li><p>For high volatility stocks, this is not unusual. Many <em>""penny stocks""</em> fail, and typically the road down is faster than the road up. Bitcoin may indeed fail, but again, it's a bit different than a stock. Bitcoin is not a company. There's no financials for Bitcoin, no VC investors, board members to report to, no product to produce, etc. Bitcoin is designed to simply be a thing itself. The hope is to disrupt currency and commodity markets and create a new ""store of value."" Literally, Bitcoin is designed to have intrinsic value. Whether it's actually working at this point is still unknown.</p></li>

"Is a higher salary worth not having a 401(k)?","12702","","<p>An individual recently got offered a job that paid significantly more than what she is making now (more than $18k - which is the maximum 401(k) contribution). She currently makes $30k a year. However, this company does not have a 401(k) plan for their employees. After talking about it and researching, it appears that all the available retirement plans/options would never equal the $18k of a 401(k). Her current company offers a 401(k) plan and matches up to 4%. From a long-term planning point of view, is the bump in salary worth not having a 401(k)? </p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>From a long-term planning point of view, is the bump in salary worth not having a 401(k)? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this case, absolutely. At $30k/year, the 4% company match comes to about $1,200 per year.  To get that you need to save $1,200 yourself, so your gross pay after retirement contributions is about <strong>$28,800</strong>.  </p>

<p>Now you have an offer making $48,000.  If you take the new job, you can put $2,400 in retirement (to get to an equivalent retirement rate), and now your gross pay after retirement contributions is <strong>$45,600</strong>.  </p>

<p>Now if the raise in salary were not as high, or you were getting a match that let you exceed the individual contribution max, the math might be different, but in this case you can effectively save the company match <em>yourself</em> and still be way ahead.</p>

<p>Note that there are MANY other factors that may also be applicable as to whether to take this job or not (do you like the work? The company? The coworkers? The location? Is there upward mobility? Are the benefits equivalent?) but not taking a 67% raise <em>just</em> because you're losing a 4% 401(k) match is not a wise decision.</p>

"After hitting 80% LTV, my mortgage lender refuses to remove PMI. Any recourse?","12690","","<p>I recently refinanced my home. At the time based on the appraisal vs. amortization I found I would be stuck with PMI (private mortgage insurance) for about 9 months.</p>

<p>I've paid extra on the mortgage each month and after 7 months I got my LTV (loan-to-value ratio) to be 79%. Yay! So I called Pacific Union and asked for PMI to be removed.</p>

<p>The woman said I'd need to fax in a written request. Then she added that my written request would likely be denied because my account had not been in good standing the last 12 months. I pointed out that I'd only had the loan for 7 months and had never been late, but that didn't seem to matter to her.</p>

<p>So I faxed in my written request. Then I read through all my documentation on my loan. Nowhere did it say that I needed to have the loan for 12 months.</p>

<p>After a week I called them back and they said it would be another week for a decision.</p>

<p>So, I waited another week and called. They now just had a recording saying they were too busy to take a call and I could leave a callback number. I did this and never heard back. I've now tried twice more to call them. Each time I leave a number and each time I don't hear back. So I've fired off a written request again.</p>

<p>At this point we've gone around the horn to the next month and in two short days I'll be paying PMI on March's payment.</p>

<p>Do they have any grounds to not remove PMI? Isn't it federally mandated that PMI must be removed at 80%? Any recourse anyone can think of?</p>

<p><strong>[EDIT]</strong> - I heard back from Pacific Union. They state that I did not sign anything agreeing to these terms which is what I was certain of. They state these terms are simply automatic with Fannie Mai backed loans and it doesn't matter if I was informed or not about these terms. They also chose not to hide behind the ""no late payments"" clause and instead said they were requiring an appraisal to remove PMI. Of course an appraisal is $400 and I'll hit 78% LTV before I would pay that much extra in PMI. I have now contacted a lawyer. I'll update again with whatever opinion the lawyer has and whether I proceed or not.</p>

<p><strong>[EDIT]</strong> - I filed a BBB complaint. They waited 30+ days to respond. In their response they indicate that the first woman (and some SE users below) are wrong. The loan does <strong>NOT</strong> have to be in good standing for 12 months. The loan simply needs <em>no late payments within 12 months</em>. They then hide behind the request for another appraisal as the sole reason to not remove it. I checked with Fannie Mae who backs the loan and was told this is optional per the lender, however the lender can force it and I have no recourse. Additionally, they could have asked for a Broker's Price Option (BPO) or a certificate of value which would cost me hundreds less. </p>

<p>At this point I cannot continue to fight them because the amount of PMI I'll pay until 78% LTV is equal to or less than the appraisal cost of $400.</p>

<p><strong>[EDIT]</strong> As of August 2015 I've hit 78% LTV. I called Pacific Union to ensure that the automatic cancellation of PMI had happened. They said no, I'd need to request that in writing. This is a violation of federal law as it's supposed to be automatic. They also said they would still deny it because now they want 24 months of good history. I've sent a threatening letter off and am waiting for a reply. If any lawyers come along and read this I'd sure like to hire you.</p>

<p><strong>[EDIT]</strong> After my letter they said they would remove PMI. They did not and I was charged again in September. I called them yet again and complained. They said PMI was going to be removed. They then charged my <em>again</em> in October! I called again. I called again and went berserk on the phone. PMI was finally removed for November 2015. First month without it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Act says that you can ask that your PMI be canceled when you've paid down your mortgage to 80% of the loan, if you have a good record of payment and compliance with the terms of your mortgage, you make a written request, and you show that the value of the property hasn't gone down, nor have you encumbered it with liens (such as a second mortgage). If you meet all these conditions, the lender must grant your request to cancel the PMI. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A borrower has a good payment history if the borrower: (1) has not made a payment that was 60 days or more past due within the first 12 months of the last 2 years prior to the later of the cancellation date, or the date that the borrower requests cancellation; or (2) has not made a payment that was 30 days or more past due within the 12 months prior to the later of the cancellation date or the date that the borrower requests cancellation. </p>

<p>I found a PDF on the website of <a href=""http://goossenaccounting.ca/content/apps/taxation_invest_income.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Goossen Accounting</a> (p3) that provides another detailed description of this procedure:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Very often, bank accounts, or even bonds and GICs, are held jointly by two or more taxpayers — perhaps a husband and wife or an elderly parent and adult child — and the question arises regarding how interest income from joint holdings should be reported and, especially, how to avoid double reporting of such income. The rule in such cases — a rule that is more easily applied in theory than in practice — <strong>is that the interest income is to be reported in the same proportions as the original contribution to the investment.</strong></p>
  
  <p>So, in the simplest of cases, where a husband and wife each contributed exactly one-half of the balance in a bank account, each would be required to report and pay tax on 50% of the interest paid or accrued during the year on that balance. Of course, the bank will not be tracking deposits to determine who contributed what; it will simply issue a T5 slip for the full amount of interest earned. The practical solution is for each spouse to report his
  or her share of that interest income, perhaps with a note explaining the breakdown of such interest as between joint account holders.</p>

<p>Should I: a) use that $1,100 to pay off debt, even though it is at a low interest rate? b) save it in a ""high interest"" savings account? c) invest it in index funds? d) a combination? e) something else?</p>
","<p>If you can get a rate of savings that is higher than your debt, you save.  If you can't then you pay off your debt.  That makes the most of the money you have.</p>

<p>Also to think about:  what are you goals?  Do you want to own a home, start a family, further your education, move to a new town?  All of these you would need to save up for.  If you can do these large transactions in cash you will be better off.</p>

<p>If it were me I would do what I think is a parroting of Dave Ramsay's advice</p>

<ol>
<li>Pay off credit cards and other unsecured debt.</li>
<li>Save up several months of living expenses as cash.  Put that in an accessible place and earn a bit on it.</li>
<li>Contribute 100% to a retirement account.  (If you start now, you can achieve amazing things when you retire)</li>
<li>Pay off that low interest debt</li>
<li>Invest a little for fun</li>
<li>Save up for a big purchase</li>
<li>Enjoy your extra money.</li>

"Can we estimate the impact of a large buy order on the share price?","12442","","<p>What I am trying to understand is: If we know the number of shares a company trades and the current price of the share, can we estimate what volume of trade that is required to move the share price in either direction?</p>

<p>I understand the general principle that: when buy orders exceed sell orders, the price goes up; and when sell orders exceed buy orders, the price goes down. But I was hoping for some specifics. Let's say:</p>

<ol>
<li>we are talking about NYSE stock exchange which is fully automated.</li>
<li>price of a stock at time t1 is $15 . </li>
<li>a significant buy order of 10,000,000 shares came to the market. There aren't enough people selling that stock. So say of the 10 million only 100,000 had a matching sell order and others are waiting. This would trigger  the automated system to start increasing the price.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>How much time</strong> does the automated system wait to increment the price? What is <strong>the frequency</strong> of the price change? What percentage is the increment etc. ? So when will t2 be when the system decides that price should inch to $15.5 and t3 when price should be $20 etc?</p>

<p>If every buy order is matched by a sell order immediately there won't be any significant price change. So the system depends on the buy order exceeding the sell orders <strong>significantly</strong> <strong>for x period of time.</strong> Can someone explain in a little more detail how this system works ? </p>
","<p>I may be underestimating your knowledge of how exchanges work; if so, I apologize.  If not, then I believe the answer is relatively straightforward.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lets say price of a stock at time <strong>t1</strong> is 15$ . </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are many types of price that an exchange reports to the public (as discussed below); let's say that you're referring to the most recent <strong>trade</strong> price.  That is, the last time a trade executed between a willing buyer and a willing seller was at $15.00.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lets say a significant buy order of 1M shares came in to the market.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here I believe might be a misunderstanding on your part.  I think you're assuming that the buy order must necessarily be requesting a price of $15.00 because that was the last published price at time <strong>t1</strong>.  In fact, orders can request any price they want.  It's totally okay for someone to request to buy at $10.00.  Presumably nobody will want to sell to him, but it's still a perfectly valid buy order.</p>

<p>But let's continue under the assumptions that at <strong>t1</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>there already are people who've told NYSE they're willing to sell at $15.00</li>
<li>there's nobody who's told NYSE they're willing to sell below $15.00</li>
<li>there already are people who've told NYSE they're willing to buy at $14.99</li>
<li>there's nobody who's told NYSE they're willing to buy above $14.99</li>
</ul>

<p>This makes the <strong>bid</strong> $14.99 and the <strong>ask</strong> $15.00.  (NYSE also publishes these prices.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There aren't enough people selling that stock.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's quite rare (in major US equities) for anyone to place a buy order that exceeds the <em>total</em> available shares listed for sale at all prices.  What I think you mean is that 1M is larger than the amount of currently-listed sell requests at the <strong>ask</strong> of $15.00.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So say of the 1M only 100,000 had a matching sell order and others are waiting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So this means that there were exactly 100,000 shares waiting to be sold at the <strong>ask</strong> of $15.00, and that all other sellers currently in the market told NYSE they were only willing to sell for a price of $15.01 or higher.  If there had been more shares available at $15.00, then NYSE would have matched them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This would be a trigger to the automated system to start increasing the price.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is another point of misunderstanding, I think.  NYSE's automated system does not <em>invent</em> a new, higher price to publish at this point.  Instead it simply reports the last trade price (still $15.00), and now that all of the willing sellers at $15.00 have been matched, NYSE also publishes the new <strong>ask</strong> price of $15.01.  It's not that NYSE has <em>decided</em> $15.01 is the new price for the stock; it's that $15.01 is now the lowest price at which anyone (known to NYSE) is willing to sell.  If nobody happened to be interested in selling at $15.01 at <strong>t1</strong>, but there were people interested in selling at $15.02, then the new published <strong>ask</strong> would be $15.02 instead of $15.01 -- not because NYSE decided it, but just because those happened to be the facts at the time.</p>

<p>Similarly, the new <strong>bid</strong> is most likely now $15.00, assuming the person who placed the order for 1M shares did not cancel the remaining unmatched 900,000 shares of his/her order.  That is, $15.00 is now the highest price at which anyone (known to NYSE) is willing to buy.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How much time does the automated system wait to increment the price, the frequency of the price change and by what percentage to increment etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I think the answer to all these questions is that the automated system does none of these things.  It merely publishes information about <strong>(a)</strong> the last trade price, <strong>(b)</strong> the price that is currently the lowest price at which anyone has expressed a willingness to sell, and <strong>(c)</strong> the price that is currently the highest price at which anyone has expressed a willingness to buy.</p>

<p>::edit:: Oh, I forgot to answer your primary question.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can we estimate the impact of a large buy order on the share price?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not only can we estimate the impact, but we can know it explicitly.  Because the exchange publishes information on all the orders it knows about, anyone tracking that information can deduce that (in this example) there were exactly 100,000 shares waiting to be purchased at $15.00.  So if a ""large buy order"" of 1M shares comes in at $15.00, then we know that all of the people waiting to sell at $15.00 will be matched, and the new lowest ask price will be $15.01 (or whatever was the next lowest sell price that the exchange had previously published).</p>

"How are exchange rates decided for each country?","12382","","<p>Currently, EUR/USD is 1.32395.  I understand that this means I will require 1.32395 USD to buy 1 EUR. But, how is this rate determined? I also, understand that there are fundamental reasons which affect this rate and the pair (EUR/USD in this case) will go up or down. But, how did we arrive at the rate initially?</p>

<p>Also, why do I keep reading that US has the power the power to print as many dollars it wants? Isn't this also true with other countries and their respective currencies?</p>
","<p>Today the rates are arrived simply on the basis of demand and supply.
Historically rates were pegged to Gold, when all currencies were printed depending on the Gold reserves. So if one country printed 100 units of currency of a 1gm of gold and other country 10 units of currency for 1 gm of gold, the rate would be 1:10.
However In the seventies with shortages of Gold and other reasons, USD became the default standard, so the rate started being pegged to the USD reserves the countries started maintaining.<br>
However later in the early eighties, US backing out, the rate purely started getting pegged to market demand and supply. So for most currencies there was a default rate to begin with and today its changed ...<br>
Incase of USD/EUR, the initial rate was determined by the weighted average of the currencies that it sought to replace. After that its been market supply and demand.<br>
Since most of the trade in international market is US denominated, largest being Oil, each country has created a huge reserves of USD. So technically if China were to bank half its USD denominated treasury bills, the USD would come crashing down, but then China itself would be at disadvantage as its value of USD its holding would become less and it cannot buy the same items. Hence all countries keep hording USD and this means US if they print more money, the value will not come down, because it that happens, all countries holding USD would loose their value of reserve. In essence a country can print as much as currency it wants if all(majority) its debts and trades are denominated in local currencies. This is 100% true for US and hence it can get away by printing money. This is also true to a large extent for Japan as bulk of its Debts are denominated in JPY.    </p>

<p>In 2005 federal regulators stipulated that banks needed to get better with security for online banking customers, but they did not endorse a particular technology. Tokens (aka fobs) were endorsed.

"Why should one only contribute up to the employer's match in a 401(k)?","12356","","<p>On a recent edition of Jim Cramer's Mad Money, he urgently (does he do things otherwise?) recommended that you ONLY contribute up to the employer's match in your 401(k) and put the rest of what you normally would have contributed into an IRA.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I missed most of segment and I didn't get to understand the Why?</p>

<p>I have a rollover IRA (from my previous employer's 401(k)) and a 401(k) from my current employer.  I'm putting 10% of my salary in my 401(k) which is more than enough to get the employer match.  Given my income level, if I put money in an IRA (which has limits on deductions) before maxing out my 401(k) I won't get the same tax advantage as if I just threw everything into a 401(k).</p>

<p>So why would anyone contribute just enough to get the employer match on the 401(k) and put the rest in an IRA?</p>
","<p>The matching funds are free money, so it is a very good idea to take that money off the table.  Look at it as free 100% return: you deposit $1000, your employer matches that $1000, you now have $2000 in your 401(k).  (Obviously, I'm keeping things simple.  Vesting schedules mean that the employer match isn't yours to keep immediately, but rather after some time; usually in chunks.)</p>

<p>Beyond the employer match, you need to consider what is available for investment in a 401(k).  Typically, your options are more limited then in an IRA.  The cost of the 401(k) should be considered, as it isn't trivial for most.  (The specifics will of course vary, but in large IRA accounts are cheaper.)</p>

<p>So, it's about the opportunity costs.  Up to the employer match, it doesn't matter as much that your investment choices are more limited in a 401(k), because you're getting 100% return just on the matching funds.  Once that is exhausted, you have more opportunity for returns, due to having more options available to you, by going with an account that provides more choices.</p>

<p>The overall principle here is that you have to look at the whole picture.  This is similar to the notion that you should pay-down your high interest debt before investing, because from the perspective of investing the interest you're paying represent a loss, or negative return on investment, since money is going out of your accounts.  Specific to your question, you have to consider the various types of investment vehicles available to you.  It is not just about 401(k) and IRA accounts.  You may also consider a straight brokerage account, a savings account, CDs, etc.  The costs and returns that you can typically expect are your guides through the available choices.</p>

"MasterCard won't disclose who leaked my credit card details","12345","","<p>I was recently informed, by the payment processing agency of my bank, that an online shop was compromised and that as a precaution my MasterCard credit card was frozen and replaced. There was no actual fraudulent charge.</p>

<p>I have inquired with my bank which particular shop was compromised, but was told that they do not receive this information from MasterCard for privacy reasons.</p>

<p>I feel that I am entitled to know where <strong>my</strong> private information was leaked. It does influence my decisions as a consumer. Further I have to consider that other private information may also have been leaked. The privacy argument seems pretextual.</p>

<p>Is it common to withhold this kind of information from affected customers? Are there any further ways to find out more about what happened?</p>

<p>Note: I was unable to speak to anyone at MasterCard, all attempts were forwarded automatically to the bank.</p>
","<p>As indicated in comments, this is common practice in the US as well as EU.  For example, in <a href=""http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2014/02/27/may-be-fraud-victim-but-cant-tell-why-or-how.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">this Fox Business article</a>, a user had basically the same experience: their card was replaced but without the specific merchant being disclosed.  When the reporter contacted Visa, they were told:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""We also believe that the public interest is best served by quickly notifying financial institutions with the information necessary to protect themselves and their cardholders from fraud losses. Even a slight delay in notification to financial institutions could be costly,” the spokesperson said in an e-mail statement. “Visa works with the breached entity to collect the necessary information and provides payment card issuers with the affected account numbers so they can take steps to protect consumers through independent fraud monitoring, and if needed, reissuing cards. The most critical information needed is the affected accounts, which Visa works to provide as quickly as possible.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What they're not saying, of course, is that it's in Visa's best interests that merchants let Visa know right away when a leak occurs, without having to think about whether it's going to screw that merchant over in the press.  If the merchant has to consider PR, they may not let the networks know in as timely of a fashion - they may at least wait until they've verified the issue in more detail, or even wait until they've found who to pin it on so they don't get blamed.</p>

<p>But beyond that, the point is that it's easier for the network (Visa/Mastercard/etc.) to have a system that's just a list of card numbers to submit to the bank for re-issuing; nobody there really cares which merchant was at fault, they just want to re-issue the cards quickly.  Letting you know who's at fault is separate.  There's little reason for the issuing bank to <em>ever</em> know; you should find out from the merchant themselves or from the network (and in my experience, usually the former).</p>

<p>Eventually you may well find out - the article suggest that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[T]he situation is common, but there is some good news: consumers do in many cases find out the source of the breach.</p>

"Is buying a lottery ticket considered an investment?","12340","","<p>Can one consider the act of participating in a lottery (by buying tickets) as a high-risk high-return investment?</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: I do not consider this question to be duplicate of this one: <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/57931/are-lottery-tickets-ever-a-wise-investment-provided-the-jackpot-is-large-enough"">question about lottery</a> because that question assumes lottery tickets to be investment, but I am asking whether it is an investment or not.</p>

<p>By the way, here's the definition from <a href=""http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment.asp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Investopedia</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An investment is an asset or item that is purchased with the hope that it will generate income or appreciate in the future. In an economic sense, an investment is the purchase of goods that are not consumed today but are used in the future to create wealth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So a lottery ticket falls under this definition... it is an item that is purchased with the <strong>hope</strong> that it will generate income.</p>
","<p>There is a clear difference between investing and gambling. </p>

<p>When you invest, you are purchasing an asset that has value. It is purchased in the hopes that the asset will either increase in value or generate income. This definition holds true whether you are investing in shares of stock, in real estate, or in a comic book collection. You can also purchase debt: if you loan money, you own debt that will (hopefully) be repaid and generate income. </p>

<p>Gambling is playing a game for chance. When you gamble, you have not purchased an asset; you have only paid to participate in a game. Some games have a degree of skill (blackjack, poker), others are pure chance (slot machine). In most gambling games, the odds are against the player and in favor of the one running the game. </p>

<p>Lottery tickets, without a doubt, are gambling. </p>

<p>There is <a href=""http://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0512/investing-vs.-gambling-where-is-your-money-safer.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">a good article on Investopedia</a> that discusses the difference between investing and gambling in more detail. </p>

<p>One thing that this article discusses is the <em>house edge</em>, or the advantage that the people running a gambling game have over the players.  With most casino games, the house has an advantage of between 1 and 15% over the players.  With a typical lottery, the house edge is 50%.</p>

<hr>

<p>To address some of the points made by the OP's recent edit and in the comments:</p>

<p>I do not think the definitions of investment and gambling need to be dependent on expected value.  There can be bad investments, where the odds of a good result are low.  Similarly, there could be gambling games where the odds are in the player's favor, either due to the skill of the player or through some quirk of the game; it's still gambling.</p>

<p>Investing is purchasing an asset; gambling is a game of chance.</p>

<p>I do not consider a lottery ticket an asset.  When you buy a lottery ticket, you are just paying a fee to participate in a game.  It is the same as putting a coin in a slot machine.  The fact that you are given a piece of paper and made to wait a few days for the result do not change this.</p>

<p>Assets have inherent value.  They might be valuable because of their ability to generate income (stocks, bonds, debt), their utility (precious metals, commodities, real estate), or their desirability as a thing of beauty (collectibles), for example.  A lottery ticket, however, is only an element of a game.  It has no value other than in the game.</p>

"Why is being ""upside down"" on a mortgage so bad?","12314","","<p>For the longest time (especially during/after the housing crash in the US), people would speak in hushed whispers or terrified pleas when they talked about being upside down on their mortgage. While I understand that an asset suddenly losing a huge chunk of its value is an upsetting event, I don't see why owing more on a mortgage than a home is worth is so <em>specifically</em> feared.</p>

<p>After all, that's standard practice for common loans like car loans (""gap"" insurance exists because car loans are so frequently underwater) and student loans (by their very nature are 100% unsecured). Plus, these types of assets are inherently even riskier than home loans: the chances of accidentally destroying your car are substantially more than destroying your house, and student loans can literally never be escaped from.</p>

<p>Finally, home loans are extended over extremely long periods (i.e. 15 or 30 years), making any fluctuations in their value short-lived - even less reason to be obsessed over their current value relative to the loan.</p>

<p>Is there some legal issue with being underwater on a mortgage that would make this scarier than other types of loans? Is this a reaction to the common misconception that homes have a great return-on-investment? <strong>What specific reason makes underwater home loans so scary?</strong></p>
","<p>I can think of a few reasons why they seem like a bigger deal to people than similar situations with other loans.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Mortgage values are a lot larger than car loans.</strong>  For many people, real estate is by far their largest investment.  Being underwater on your car represents relatively few dollars by comparison.  Student loans can potentially be scarier, but how do you know if your education is underwater?</li>
<li><strong>People often have a belief that home values appreciate.</strong>  This is perpetuated by realtors and by a market that did appreciate for a long time. For this reason having a home underwater was unexpected and therefore scary.</li>
<li><strong>Mortgages underwater were part of a widespread economic problem.</strong>  In some sense people in this situation could feel like they were victims of a whole system breaking down, rather than just bad luck on a single investment.</li>
<li><strong>Being underwater on a home loan can impact your freedom</strong> to do things like move in order to take another job or even move out of your house and live with your parents again.  When your home is significantly underwater you can feel stuck in a way that you don't feel when other loans are under water.</li>
</ol>

<p>As you point out, though, being underwater on your home loan is a less serious condition than having large student loans and a poor paying job, for example.  If the student loan situation ever comes to a head, we may have people talking about student loans in hushed tones.</p>

<p>I have decided to roll my 401(k) into a Roth IRA.  I use ThinkOrSwim as my broker currently, so I plan on opening an IRA with them.  When opening the account I'm presented with the choice between a Rollover IRA and a Roth IRA.  The description for the Rollover IRA says its for rolling over a retirement account.  My question is: What is the difference between the two?  Can I not just open a Roth IRA and roll the funds into that account?</p>
","<p>If you have the cash on hand to pay the tax on the amount you are transferring I recommend moving to a Roth IRA</p>

<p><strong>An IRA is tax-deferred</strong>. You put in pretax contributions in to an IRA, and you are taxed on that money (your contributions and interest earned) when you withdraw it at retirement, age 59 1/2. </p>

<p>The idea being that you will be taking less out per year in your retirement years, putting you into a lower tax bracket. The major problem is most people draw out as much or more a year in their retirement years than when they were working.</p>

<p><strong>A Roth IRA grows tax free</strong> You put after tax contributions into a Roth IRA, you have paid taxes on the contributions, and you are never taxed on the growth. When you draw the money out at retirement you don't pay any income taxes on that money.</p>

<p>Let me give you an example:</p>

<p>For this example we will use the following information for both scenario:</p>

<ul>
<li>You are in the 25% fed tax bracket</li>
<li>Your mutual fund investment will average 12% a year.</li>
<li>You will invest from age 25 to age 65.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will invest $400 per month for a total of $4800. The current maximum is $5000 if you are under 50 years old</p>

<h2>Roth IRA</h2>

<p>$400 dollars after taxes is $300</p>

<p>Invest $300 a month, at age 65 you have 3,529,432</p>

<p>You owe no taxes on this money, it doesn't matter how much you take out a year.</p>

<h2>IRA</h2>

<p>$400 dollars a month is taken pretax out of your paycheck.</p>

<p>Invest $400 per month, at age 65 you have $4,705,909
You owe taxes of 25% as you draw that out for at total tax of 1,176,477</p>

<p>4,705,909 - 1,176,477 = 3,529,432 cash in your pocket</p>

<p>The problem is if you draw out more than $82,400 (current 2010 filing single) per year you will be pushed to a higher tax bracket and take more of your money away.</p>

<p>If you decide to buy a vacation home and you take out $250,000 to pay for it, that's counted as income for that year any you will be in the 33% tax bracket.</p>

<p>Even if you can keep yourself to a low income the government forces your hand and makes you draw out more money at age 70, based on their tables, forcing you into a higher tax bracket</p>

<p>Can I pay for a portion of the down payment &amp; closing costs without it being considered fraud? When does my money stop being a ""gift"" and start being fraud? Are we off the hook because I won't have part ownership of the home (see above emphasis)?</p>

<p>Also related: <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/57155/how-can-i-legally-and-efficiently-help-my-girlfriend-build-equity-by-helping-wit"">How can I legally and efficiently help my girlfriend build equity by helping with a mortgage?</a></p>
","<p>With the standard ""I am not a lawyer"" disclaimer, consider this question:</p>

<p>If you and your girlfriend split up sometime after purchasing the house but before getting married, would you expect her to repay you for the closing costs and downpayment?  That is, if you write her a check for $5k, and 6 months after she signs the papers for the house one of you decides to break up with the other, would you expect her to write you a check for $5k in return?  </p>

<p>That is the difference between ""a gift"" and ""a loan disguised as a gift"".  If the answer is no, you don't expect it back, then everything is fine and you're in the clear - it's perfectly legal to give someone money.  If the answer is yes, you would want to be ""paid back"", then it's not a gift and you run the risk of running afoul of the regulations.  </p>

<p>With respect to a previous answer about ""gifting money that is not taxed"", in the US one person can give another up to $14,000 without worrying about gift taxes, and even in the event that you exceed that amount, the excess would simply eat into the lifetime exemption of $5,250,000.  (Individual states may have different rules and exempt amounts that would apply to state taxes.)  </p>

<p>Please also consider the income issue for your ""rental agreement"".  Your GF would be expected to declare that amount and pay income tax on it as a business.  She might also declare part of that amount as expected income for purposes of securing the loan, but that may run into its own issues (you're not a roommate, and presumably the home is not a duplex or set up as apartments, and presumably she would not offer a similar deal to someone other than you).  </p>

"How often can/should I apply for a credit limit increase?","12244","","<p>I just got my first personal credit card 8 months ago, and I'm occasionally hitting/getting close to the credit limit. I've never missed a payment or had to pay a single fee, and I'm using the card for everything. </p>

<p>I tried to get my credit limit boosted two months ago and it was boosted a couple hundred bucks, but it barely solves the problem; I still have to manually pay off my balance instead of waiting for my automatic, monthly payments. This was the only time I requested a limit raise (and it was successful, but not for the amount I requested).</p>

<p>I want to get my limit boosted as soon as possible, but how often should I request a boost? Will it negatively impact my ability to raise my limit if I request a limit raise too soon after my last request?</p>

<p>My current limit is low. My typical utilization is ~50% or more at statement time which I know is high and could affect my credit rating. Sometimes I've had to manually pay my statement, and this month I had a charge declined because I hit the ceiling for the first time (neglected to check my limit before a large purchase).</p>

<p>My credit card is my only ""debt"", student loans paid off, I own my car outright. Renting house, no mortgage.</p>
","<p>While f1StudentInUs is correct in all aspects, I would also suggest you get more than one line, rather than increase a single one. Apply for a card a year after your first.  I keep three cards, but I can't honestly argue that it is important to have three.</p>

<p>The reason is simple: should you lose your only card, then you are left without credit; if you lose one of the two, you still have that payment option available.</p>

<p>While living off of cash is the wisest, if you can, having the option of credit for online purchases and other situations where a credit card offers advantages over cash is pretty smart.</p>

<p>However, now that you have a card and a line of credit, don't feel compelled to use it for everything.  Put a few recurring payments on there and go back to cash.  This will keep your utilization low and not create dangerous habits.</p>

So, she earned about $15,000 in 2012, pre-tax.</p>

"Defaulting on credit cards before leaving the country","12191","","<p>I have a colleague who is going back to his country after staying for a couple of years in US. He has 3-4 credit cards plus a personal loan. His total debt would come to around $10,000. Some days ago, he told me he is going to default on the accounts. He figures, since he is not planning to come back to US, it should not matter to him.</p>

<p>Question is, is this a bad move on his part, and if it is, how can I convince him?</p>
","<p>For starters that may be criminal fraud. Since he's defaulting not because he's bankrupt but because he just doesn't want to pay - he's in fact <strong>stealing</strong>, or at least committing fraud. That type of criminal offenses would be criminal in his home country as well (I am not aware of any country that doesn't criminalize stealing and fraud), and he may be prosecuted if the US government does file a complaint, even if he's ""at home"". I do not know of any country that limits its criminal code only to their own territory. He may also be extradited back to the US, if his home country has such a treaty.</p>

<p>That said, if he has no intentions to come back to the US <em>now</em> - he may change his plans in the future. It will be too late to ""change his mind"" then, he will be in big troubles, may be arrested on landing, denied visa, most likely denied any credit, and harassed by collectors.</p>

<p>Last but not least - the debt is a contract between him and the credit card company. Even if the US doesn't file a criminal complaint at home - the credit card company may file a civil complain and sue him for the money. The courts in his home country will likely to accept jurisdiction since he refused to return to the US.</p>

<p>Bottom line - stealing is wrong, and the victim ( the bank/credit card company) may very well go after him wherever he goes, and for a long time. Statute of limitations in the US doesn't advance while he's out of country, so the matter may still be open even if he comes back in 50 years, and the victim may also pursue action against him in his home country.</p>

"Ways to avoid being labeled a pattern day trader","12165","","<p>Other than the obvious answer of ""don't day trade"" what ways can I avoid being labeled a pattern day trader.</p>

<p>I've read the rules for when the label is triggered but I'm wondering about some real experiences and interpretation of the rule because it's got a lot of conditions.</p>

<p>For example will I be labeled a day trader if:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If I do three day trades every week in a margin account but never more than 3 in a week with no other trading activity on the account.</p></li>
<li><p>I do 10 day trades in 2 days in a non-margin.</p></li>
<li><p>I have 10 day trades in 5 days but in the same time I've closed 100 open positions that were open prior and open 100 new positions that remain open after.  (day trades &lt; 6% of volume)    In a margin account?  Not in a margin account?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There are a lot of variations, just trying to get an idea as to what the limits are and how to avoid them.</p>
","<p><a href=""http://www.finra.org/Investors/SmartInvesting/AdvancedInvesting/DayTrading/P005906%20FINRA%20description%20of%20day%20trading%20rules"">FINRA Description of Day Trading rules</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The rules adopt a new term ""pattern day trader,"" which includes any
  margin customer that day trades (buys then sells or sells short then
  buys the same security on the same day) four or more times in five
  business days, provided the number of day trades are more than six
  percent of the customer's total trading activity for that same
  five-day period.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, there's several ways to avoid being labeled a pattern day trader:</p>

<ol>
<li>Don't make four day trades during any period of 5 business days. Whether these 5 business days are in the same week doesn't matter. 2 day trades on July 1, and 2 on July 8 will trigger the designation (since July 4th was a holiday)</li>
<li>Don't have a margin account. But if you do day trades in this account, you need to make very sure you have the actual cash to cover it before you buy, otherwise you can run into the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_riding"">Free-riding rules</a>. Trying to profit from the small swings of day-trading with no leverage would be very tough.</li>
<li>Have the number of day-trades (NOT the volume of the trades) be less than 6 percent of your total trades for that 5-business day period. I wouldn't recommend trying to generate 
trades just for this purpose, because of the cost and the increased risk.</li>
<li>Not care about the pattern day-trading label, because you have $25K worth of equity in your account.</li>

"What are Vanguard's Admiral Shares?","12102","","<p>What are Vanguard's Admiral Shares?  I recently heard about them, and I'm not sure how they differ from the normal shares of their mutual funds I have.</p>
","<p>Vanguard's Admiral shares are like regular (""investor"") shares in their funds, only they charge lower expense ratios. They have higher investment minimums, though. (For instance, the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund has <a href=""https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0085&amp;FundIntExt=INT"">a minimum of $3,000 and an expense ratio of .18% for the Investor Shares class</a>, but a <a href=""https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0585&amp;FundIntExt=INT"">minimum of $10,000 and an expense ratio of .07% for Admiral Shares</a>). If you've bought a bunch of investor shares and now meet the (recently-reduced) minimum for Admiral shares, or if you have some and buy some more investor shares in the future and meet the minimums, you will qualify for a free, no-tax-impact conversion to the Admiral Shares and save yourself some money.</p>

<p>For more information, see the <a href=""https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/article/fund-announcement-10062010"">Vanguard article on their recent changes to Admiral Shares minimums</a>.</p>

<p>Vanguard also offers institutional-class shares with even <em>lower</em> expense ratios than that (with a <a href=""https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0855&amp;FundIntExt=INT"">minimum of $5 million, .06% expense ratios on the same fund</a>). A lot of the costs of operating a fund are per-individual, so they don't need to charge you extra fees for putting in more money after a certain point. They'd rather be competitive and offer it at cost.</p>

<p>Vanguard's funds typically have very low expense ratios to begin with. (The investor shares I've been using as an example are advertised as ""84% lower than the average expense ratio of funds with similar holdings"".) In fact, Vanguard's whole reason for existing is the premise (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vanguard_Group#The_index_fund_philosophy"">stated in founder John C Bogle's undergraduate thesis at Princeton</a>) that individuals can generally get better returns by investing in a cheap fund that tracks an index than by investing in mutual funds that try to pick stocks and beat the index <em>and</em> charge you a steep markup. The average real return of the stock market is supposedly something like 4%; even a small-looking percentage like 1% can eat a big portion of that. Over the course of 40 years waiting for retirement, saving 1% on expenses could leave you with something like 50% more money when you've retired.</p>

<p>If you are interested in the lower expense ratios of the Admiral share classes but cannot meet the minimums, note that funds which are available as ETFs can be traded from Vanguard brokerage accounts commission-free and typically charge <a href=""https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0970&amp;FundIntExt=INT"">the same expense ratios as the Admiral shares</a> without any minimums (but you need to trade them as individual shares, and this is less convenient than moving them around in specific dollar amounts).</p>

If the money went into a UK bank account would that be a different matter?</p>
","<p>It makes no difference (to the UK) what country a bank account is in.  What matters is whether you are resident in the UK or not while employed locally in a foreign country.  You're taxed on where you are tax resident (which could be either country, both, or neither), not where the money is earned or banked.  You can assume, with modern exchange of information agreements, that all money you put in bank accounts anywhere in the world will eventually be known to the UK authorities.</p>

<p>The rules for when you are a UK tax resident changed recently, there is now a <a href=""http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/international/rdr3.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">statutory test for residence</a> (pdf).  The rules are complex, but in general if you are outside the UK for less than one full tax year you're still resident, and in many cases where you're gone longer than that you may still be, depending on the length of your trips back to the UK and the ties you have there.</p>

<p>So a 6-month winter job in Thailand teaching English as a foreign language will be subject to UK tax if you come back after, even if you leave all the money there or in a third country. If you pay local tax as well there are agreements between countries to avoid double taxation, but these do vary.  What you do about National Insurance payments while gone for a short time is another complex area.</p>

"Are Index Funds really as good as ""experts"" claim?","11934","","<p>I use the quotations because generally the people touting these the most (John Bogle) are also ones selling the index funds. Being biased doesn't mean they're wrong, but it does mean they may not be telling the whole truth. </p>

<p>I understand the idea that index funds are better than managed accounts. Lower fees, probably better returns, etc. etc., but generally when this topic is discussed those are the only two options considered as if they were the only investment options out there. I also agree that they probably make a lot more sense as ""fire and forget"" type investments for people to invest as passively as at all possible. </p>

<p>But are investment funds really all that much better than just buying stocks for long term investing? Index fund fees may be incredibly low, but they're still yearly fees. Whereas with a stock you can (in theory) purchase a significant ownership stake in a company for $5 and it will cost you another $5 to divest. (Oversimplification, I know.)</p>

<p>Also major index funds may represent a more diverse investment, also in theory, but take for instance the S&amp;P500 where 50 companies make up about half the market cap.</p>

<p>Why would it not make more sense to invest in a handful of these heavyweights instead of also having to carry the weight of the other 450 (some of which are mostly just baggage)?</p>

<p>Even Warren Buffet has been touting the index fund for a while now, but I haven't heard that Berkshire Hathaway has major holdings in an S&amp;P500 index fund. So it seems like there's more to the story. </p>

<p>Where do you think the tipping point really is here?</p>

<p>Edit: had to be away from the computer most of the day. Don't mean to insinuate at all that index funds are bad. Just questioning whether they're the right call for someone willing to be active enough to check their investments a few times a year. </p>

<p>Edit2: Just because it seems like some people may still be misunderstanding me... the comparison that this entire question revolves around is long-term, mostly passive invesments in <strong>companies</strong> rather than almost all the eggs in the index fund basket. This may be a better way to think about it rather than my question of picking stocks... ie: ""[PickaCompany] has historically done pretty well, their business models seems pretty good, people like their product, I expect them to continue making profit for a while, they have a large customer base and a good share of the market in their industry, they seem like a good investment."" Oversimplification by far, but it's generally these things that put companies in index funds and at the top. </p>
","<p>I actually love this question, and have hashed this out with a friend of mine where my premise was that at some volume of money it must be advantageous to simply track the index yourself.</p>

<p>There some obvious touch-points:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Most people don't have anywhere near the volume of money required for even a $5 commission outweigh the large index fund expense ratios.</p></li>
<li><p>There are logistical issues that are massively reduced by holding a fund when it comes to winding down your investment(s) as you get near retirement age.</p></li>
<li><p>Index funds are not touted as categorically ""the best"" investment, they are being touted as the best place for the average person to invest.</p></li>
<li><p>There is still a management component to an index like the S&amp;P500.  The index doesn't simply buy a share of Apple and watch it over time.  The S&amp;P 500 isn't simply a single share of each of the 500 larges US companies it's market cap weighted with frequent rebalancing and constituent changes.  VOO makes a lot of trades every day to track the S&amp;P index, ""passive index investing"" is almost an oxymoron.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The most obvious part of this is that if index funds were ""the best"" way to invest money Berkshire Hathaway would be 100% invested in VOO.  The argument for ""passive index investing"" is simplified for public consumption.  The reality is that over time large actively managed funds have under-performed the large index funds net of fees.  In part, the thrust of the advice is that the average person is, or should be, more concerned with their own endeavors than they are managing their savings.  Investment professionals generally want to avoid ""How come I my money only returned 4% when the market index returned 7%?  If you track the index, you won't do worse than the index; this helps people sleep better at night.</p>

<p>In my opinion the dirty little secret of index funds is that they are able to charge so much less because they spend $0 making investment decisions and $0 on researching the quality of the securities they hold.  They simply track an index; XYZ company is 0.07% of the index, then the fund carries 0.07% of XYZ even if the manager thinks something shady is going on there.</p>

<p>The argument for a majority of your funds residing in Mutual Funds/ETFs is simple, When you're of retirement age do you really want to make decisions like should I sell a share of Amazon or a share of Exxon?  Wouldn't you rather just sell 2 units of SRQ Index fund and completely maintain your investment diversification and not pay commission?  For this simplicity you give up three basis points?  It seems pretty reasonable to me.</p>

"Should I pay off zero interest debt early?","11931","","<p>My cash reserves are around $11k, including an emergency fund of about a month and a half, and I budget rigorously.  The only debt I have is $7k at zero interest, paid at $300/month, and it's from a family member who would almost certainly defer payments if something catastrophic happened. (BTW, our family has successfully made and paid tens of thousand of dollars of inter-member debt for many years, and the bankers and lenders vary over time.) </p>

<p>I happen to be in a free Dave Ramsey class, and a question came up.  Should I pay off the zero interest debt before finishing my emergency fund?  If so, why?  My inclination is to finish accumulating my emergency fund first.  The only substantive argument I can see to pay early is an emotional one:  it's appealing and secure to have zero debt. Paying it off early will actually cost me money, because inflation is decreasing the value of the debt over time.  My job is extremely stable, and also it's a rotating 12 month contract where I doubt they ever break the contract.</p>

<p>P.S.  I should be honest and admit I'm currently throwing away some 401k match;  my employer matches an incredible 9% 1-for-1 but I can only afford 8% while I'm getting on my feet.  I've calculated that 8.5% is sufficient for my retirement.</p>
","<p>First I must say that I'm not a Ramsey fan. Sometimes loans will make your financial situation significantly better. Especially if its a 0% loan. Generally, I do think that leveraging has its place, its the <strong>ab</strong>-use of loans what causes problems, not the use.</p>

<p>Re your question - you're right in trying to first build up an emergency fund. You should have enough in it to be able to pay for yourself for at least half a year of unemployment or zero income. You only have one month.</p>

<p>Your family member gave you money for free, which is admirable, but I'm sure there's a limit to everyone's generosity and he might not give it to you for free again, once you pay it off. Thus, you should be able to handle your future troubles on your own, and emergency fund is a crucial part of this.</p>

<p>Pay as agreed, try not to be late, and you'll pay the loan off within 3 years. If you accumulate enough emergency fund, and you still have some extra left - pay some extra on the loan in order to pay it off early.</p>

<p>Do make sure you take full advantage of the employer's 401k match. This has, IMHO, much higher priority than paying off the 0% loan early.</p>

"Why do stocks tend to trade at high volumes at the end of (or start) the trading day?","11929","","<p>Not related to <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/26539/why-is-the-volume-highest-at-the-beginning-and-end-of-a-trading-day"">this</a> question, I am asking why stocks seem to be traded at very high volumes right at the start and end of the trading day. Is this because these graphs factor in all of the premarket and postmarket trades?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zKCRl.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<p>Trading at the start of a session is by far higher than at any other time of the day. This is mostly due to markets incorporating news into the prices of stocks. In other words, there are a lot of factors that can affect a stock, 24 hours a day, but the market trades for only 6.5 hours a day. So, a lot of news accumulates during the time when people cannot trade on that news. Then when markets finally open, people are able to finally trade on that news, and there is a lot of ""price discovery"" going on between market participants.</p>

<p>In the last minutes of trading, volumes increase as well. This can often be attributed to certain kinds of traders closing out their position before the end of the day. For example, if you don't want to take the risk a large price movement at the start of the next day affecting you, you would need to completely close your position.</p>

<p>Just something I always wondered about, but never actually got anyone to answer.  So I hope someone on here knows why!</p>
","<p>It used to be that stocks were traded in fractions too. It was only recently that they all were converted over into <a href=""http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/decimalization.asp"">decimals</a>.</p>

<p>I think you're basically right about being a holdover <a href=""http://money.howstuffworks.com/personal-finance/financial-planning/stock-market-use-fractions.htm"">from Europe, especially Spain</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These early stockbrokers [who were trying to create the NYSE] looked to 
  Europe for a model to build their
  system on and decided to base it on the system of Spain. This was
  largely due to the fact that the U.S. dollar's value had been based on
  the value of the Spanish real.</p>
  
  <p>The real was the Spanish silver dollar and was divided into eight
  parts. This evolved from the method of counting on the hands, similar
  to the decimal system. The difference was that the decimal system used
  the thumbs as part of the number while this other system used the
  thumbs to denote the total of the four fingers. Therefore, a person
  would count to four on one hand and then use the thumb to indicate a
  total while they counted on the other hand. Two thumbs equaled eight.
  The real could be broken into two, four or eight parts, giving birth
  to the term pieces of eight.</p>

"If a house is in foreclosure what does the bank own vs what the former owner owns","11725","","<p>So we were having a discussion about what we would all do if we were unfortunate enough to have our homes go into foreclosure.  I asserted that all the appliances and even window blinds would still be my property.  I would be allowed to keep my washer, dryer, fridge, dishwasher, blinds and even any fancy light socket covers I had installed.</p>

<p>I would not have access to the stove, built in microwave and hood, copper wiring, carpet or fence material.</p>

<p>So what is the law or generally accepted rule for what I bank owns when the home is foreclosed on?</p>
","<p>My understanding is that bank would generally have title to the permanent fixtures in the home, and that the prior homeowner would have the right to keep temporary fixtures, decor, and other personal property.  Most things are clear-cut: a toilet is a permanent fixture. A shower curtain is not.</p>

<p>For some items that aren't so clear-cut, it depends on the way things are handled in your jurisdiction.  In some areas, appliances like washer/dryer/fridge are traditionally bought and sold with the house.  In those areas, those appliances would be considered permanent fixtures of the property.  In other areas, the appliances don't usually convey with the house, so they wouldn't become the bank's property either.</p>

<p>Many people make improvements like upgrading shower heads, adding a chandelier, or installing fancy light socket covers.  You're probably within your rights to take those back as long as you install a replacement, and those replacements don't have to be very nice.</p>

<p>It's sadly become common for homeowners to strip a home that's in foreclosure, taking permanent fixtures when they leave.  Those items are technically your property until the place is actually foreclosed.  If you happen to sell your fridge on Craigslist for $200, there's not much your bank can do.</p>

<p>After foreclosure, the new owner's top priority will be to get you out of the house quickly and quietly.  I've heard that they'll actually offer cash for cooperation, so that the resident can leave with some dignity and have some cash to start a new life.  The bank isn't going to go after you for the curtains -- it's relatively unimportant, it's not worth their time, and you probably wouldn't be able to pay them back anyway.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I'm not a lawyer nor an accountant. Everything I just said is probably wrong. :)  I learned all of this last year when I bought a house that had been foreclosed and was ""stripped"" by the previous owner.</p>

"Should I use regular or adjusted close for backtesting?","11723","","<p>In an attempt run few backtesting tasks, I have obtained some historical data. I noticed that there are two closing prices available, <strong>regular close</strong> and <strong>adjusted close</strong>.</p>

<p>After doing some reading, I have learned that the <strong>adjusted close</strong> value is being affected by the following parameters and in fact <strong>NOT</strong> the real close value on that day.</p>

<ol>
<li>Cash dividends</li>
<li>Stock dividends</li>
<li>Stock splits</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm still confused which one of the close values should I use though, the real one or the adjusted?</p>

<p>It seems that the adjusted close gives more accurate data about the stock but it is not the real price.</p>
","<p>You would have to compare your backtesting to what you will be doing in real trading, and try to have the backtesting as close to your real trading as possible. Note: you may never get the backtesting to match your real trading exactly but you need to get as close as possible.</p>

<p>The whole purpose of backtesting is to check if your trading strategies - your signals, entries and exits, and your stops - are profitable over various market conditions. As you would be using actual closes to do your real trading you should be using this to also do your backtesting.</p>

<p>Rather than using adjusted data to get an idea of your total return from your backtesting, you can always add the value of the dividends and other corporate actions to the results from using the actual data. You may even find a way to add any dividends and other corporate action to your results automatically, i.e. any dividend amount added to your total return if the stock is held during the ex-dividend date.</p>

<p>If you are using adjusted data in your backtesting this may affect any stops you have placed, i.e. it may cause your stop to be triggered earlier or later than in real trading. So you will need to determine how you will treat your stops in real trading. </p>

<p><em>Will you adjust them when there is corporate action such as dividends?</em> </p>

<p><em>Or will you leave them constant until actual prices have gone up?</em></p>

<p>If you will be leaving your stops constant then you should definitely be using actual data in your backtesting to better match your real trading.</p>

"When does giving a gift ""count"" for tax year?","11703","","<p>If I send a check to someone in one tax year, but they don't cash it (or receive it) until the next tax year, which tax year does the gift count against?</p>
","<p>Generally it goes by when they receive the check, not when they cash the check. Though if the check was received prior to midnight on December 31st, but after the bank closes, they would probably let the tax payer decide to count it for the next year.</p>

<p>Of course if the check is from person A to person B then the only issue is gift tax, or annual limit calculations.  If it is company to person then income tax could be involved. </p>

<p>The IRS calls this <a href=""http://www.irs.gov/publications/p334/ch02.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Constructive receipt</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Income</strong>
  Under the cash method, include in your gross income all items of
  income you actually or constructively receive during your tax year. If
  you receive property or services, you must include their fair market
  value in income.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Example.</strong>
  On December 30, 2011, Mrs. Sycamore sent you a check for interior
  decorating services you provided to her. You received the check on
  January 2, 2012. You must include the amount of the check in income
  for 2012. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Constructive receipt</strong>.
  You have constructive receipt of
  income when an amount is credited to your account or made available to
  you without restriction. You do not need to have possession of it. If
  you authorize someone to be your agent and receive income for you, you
  are treated as having received it when your agent received it.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Example.</strong> 
  Interest is credited to your bank account in December 2012. You do not
  withdraw it or enter it into your passbook until 2013. You must
  include it in your gross income for 2012. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Delaying receipt of income.</strong> 
  You cannot hold checks or postpone taking possession of similar
  property from one tax year to another to avoid paying tax on the
  income. You must report the income in the year the property is
  received or made available to you without restriction.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Example.</strong>
  Frances Jones, a service contractor, was entitled to receive a $10,000
  payment on a contract in December 2012. She was told in December that
  her payment was available. At her request, she was not paid until
  January 2013. She must include this payment in her 2012 income because
  it was constructively received in 2012. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Checks.</strong><br>
  Receipt of a valid
  check by the end of the tax year is constructive receipt of income in
  that year, even if you cannot cash or deposit the check until the
  following year.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Example.</strong></p>
  
  <p>Dr. Redd received a check for $500 on December 31, 2012, from a
  patient. She could not deposit the check in her business account until
  January 2, 2013. She must include this fee in her income for 2012.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In general it is best not to cut it close. If the check is to be counted as an January event it is best to send it in January. If it is to be December event it is best to send it early enough to be able to say with confidence that the check arrived at the destination before the end of the year.</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_transit_number"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_transit_number</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A routing transit number (RTN) is a nine digit bank code, used in the
  United States, which appears on the bottom of negotiable instruments
  such as checks identifying the financial institution on which it was
  drawn. This code was designed to facilitate the sorting, bundling, and
  shipment of paper checks back to the drawer's (check writer's)
  account.</p>
  
  <p>The RTN is also used by Federal Reserve Banks to process Fedwire funds
  transfers, and by the Automated Clearing House to process direct
  deposits, bill payments, and other such automated transfers.</p>
  
  <p>The RTN number is derived from the bank's transit number originated by
  the <strong>American Bankers Association</strong>, which designed it in 1910.[1]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am going to assume that the euphemistic ABA Number has been shortened by whoever told you about it and called it the ABN.  Perhaps American Bank Number.  Either way, the technical term is RTN. Perhaps a comment or editor can straighten me out about the ABN.</p>

  International Organization for Standardization (ISO). It is a unique
  identification code for both financial and non-financial
  institutions.[1] The acronym SWIFT stands for the Society for
  Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication. When assigned to a
  non-financial institution, the code may also be known as a Business
  Entity Identifier or BEI. These codes are used when transferring money
  between banks, particularly for international wire transfers, and also
  for the exchange of other messages between banks. The codes can

"I am considering leasing a new car for my ex-wife. What can go wrong?","11696","","<p>My ex-wife is a financial wreck and is about to lose her car (lease is over) in an area of the country where you can't get around without one.  She can't get a new one because her credit is really bad (bankruptcy, 2 evictions, home foreclosure, etc...).  Anyone that has ever had financial dealings with her has regretted it. I do not want to deal with her either.</p>

<p>My ex-Mother In Law (MIL), who is very responsible with money and reliable, has cooked up a plan which gets her daughter a car for now and has a financial benefit for me as well.  </p>

<p>Her plan is to have me lease an inexpensive car (under my name) for her daughter.  The cost of the lease is $3k down and $150 a month for 48 months.  Her daughter (my ex-wife) would drive it for 2 years and then turn the car over to our son, who just turned 14 (and thus will be 16 in two years - of driving age). So for now the ex-MIL will provide the down payment and will pay the lease for 2 years.  Once our son turns 16, I will take over the lease payments and our son will use the car until the termination of the lease.  So there is a financial benefit for me in that my son will have a reasonably inexpensive (for me) vehicle to drive in, once he turns 16.</p>

<p>I am pretty sure that the ex-MIL will not let me down (I've loaned her large sums of money before and she always promptly repaid).  Her daughter, though, is a loose canon.</p>

<p>My question is this.  What can reasonably go wrong?  And how can I protect against stuff that might go wrong.  Is this a good or bad idea?</p>

<p>Some facts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ex-MIL can't co-sign because she doesn't have credit either - basically lives on fixed income.</li>
<li>Ex-wife's relatives won't co-sign cause they've been burned before</li>
<li>My credit has just recovered from the insanity of the divorce and I am planning to buy a house in a year or two.</li>
</ul>

<p>P.S.  12/24/2014 - Several people asked me to follow up, so here it goes. I was about 80% against any further financial dealings with my ex prior to posting the question.  And you guys and gals talked the rest of sense into me, so I refused to help. Despite intense lobbying from ex-MIL and some others in my ex's life.  </p>

<p>Apparently she must have been able to talk someone else into co-signing because the week after she came to pick up the kids in a brand new Toyota Prius.  So I guess happily ever after for everyone.  </p>
","<p><strong>Everything</strong> on Earth can go wrong. Including, god forbids, your MIL being hit by a bus the next day and your ex inheriting all of her belongings and none of her promises to you.</p>

<p>This <strong>is</strong> a bad idea.</p>

<p>What I would <em>suggest</em> doing would be for your MIL to buy your ex a cheap and simple clunker to move herself around without you being ever involved.</p>

<p>If you still want to go into this adventure, I'd advise to do these things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A written contract with MIL that details all the terms and agreements. Cover the potential unfortunate events like the one I made up in the first sentence.</p></li>
<li><p>A written contract with your ex about how and when she can use <strong>your</strong> car.</p></li>
<li><p>Insurance to cover all the potential damages and liabilities she can cause, in your name, with her as additional insured.</p></li>
<li><p>Be ready to bear <strong>all</strong> the costs associated with the car. You're not a co-signer in this scenario - you're the <em>only</em> signer. The dealership will come after <strong>you</strong> and you alone.</p></li>

"What does CAGR mean when it is used in relation to a company stock?","11670","","<p>I saw this abbreviation CAGR related to stocks and financial statements and I am not sure what it is. Can you please explain it to me? </p>
","<p>When dealing with investments (including stocks), CAGR is how you can describe the average growth of something over a period of time. The acronym stands for Compound Annual Growth Rate.</p>

<p>For instance:</p>

<ul>
<li>Let's say that I buy $10,000 worth of stock.</li>
<li>After one year, it's worth $9,000 (a 10% decrease)</li>
<li>After two years, it's worth $12,000 (a 33% increase)</li>
</ul>

<p>If I wanted to brag to my friends, I'd say ""I made 33% on my stock from last year!"" Anyone who has known me a bit longer would probably be more interested in what kind of return (percentage-wise) I had made in total since I initially purchased the stock (CAGR).</p>

<p>This is calculated as follows:</p>

<pre><code>CAGR = A ^ B - 1
</code></pre>

<p>where</p>

<pre><code>      Ending value
A =  -------------- 
     Beginning value
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>           1
B =  --------------
       # of years
</code></pre>

<p>so for our example,</p>

<pre><code>A = 12,000 / 10,000 = 1.2
B = 1 / 2 = 0.5

CAGR = 1.2 ^ 0.5 - 1 = 0.0955 (approximately) or 9.55%
</code></pre>

<p>You can double-check this by using that value each year and working forward</p>

<ul>
<li>Initial stock purchase of $10,000</li>
<li>Increase of 9.55% ($955) = $10,955</li>
<li>Increase of 9.55% ($1046) = $12,001</li>
</ul>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>On a side note, it is interesting that the ""simple"" calculation most people would make for the above example goes like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have $12,000 now.</li>
<li>I started with $10,000.</li>
<li>That is $2,000 profit, which is 20% of $10,000 over 2 years.</li>
<li>I made 10% profit each year.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sticking with the CAGR formula prevents such mistakes from happening.</p>

<p>Open the new account (which increases your credit limit and decreases your utilization, therefore increasing your credit score a tad) then close the old account a bit later.  Closing will have opposite effect on your score.  (Decreasing your overall limit and increasing your utilization.)</p>

<p>Unless you are paying an annual fee, I wouldn't bother actually closing the old account, just stop using it and shred the cards.  The bank will close it for you eventually.</p>

<p>If thought of as an investment, is there a benefit to having this type of policy in a poor economy?</p>
","<p>The standard answer I have heard is that if you were to purchase term life insurance and invest the difference between the cost of the policies, your investments would grow larger than the cash value of the insurance. Also when you take cash out of CVLI the insurance value drops by a like amount. So you can't have your cake and leave it to your heirs too. Either you get the cash value OR they get the insurance value. Hopefully, there could be some of both.</p>

<p>Although I believe the philosophy of that answer I have two issues with it. First, you must be dedicated enough to invest the difference every month. I can imagine that might be tough to do consistently and if you take breaks from the investing will you still accumulate more than you would have with the insurance? Second, for the past couple of years all of my investments in mutual funds have lost value. My life insurance has continued to grow cash value over the same time period. Hmm, maybe there isn't a one size fits all solution.</p>

<p>Likewise, you can offer to trade a stock at whatever price you want: that's the definition of a limit order. You might not find a willing buyer or seller at that price, but you can certainly open an order.</p>

<p>Stock quotes that you get from your broker or a finance web site reflect the price as last traded. These quotes are updated throughout the trading day and the frequency and delay varies amongst quote providers.</p>

<p>Like Knuckle-Dragger suggests in the comments, there are ways to get real-time quotes.</p>

<p>It's often more helpful to think in terms of bid/ask instead of ""official price"". See <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/1063/can-someone-explain-a-stocks-bid-vs-ask-price-relative-to-current-price"">this question for details</a>.</p>

"IRS sent me a letter...I messed up by unwittingly taking money out of a Roth IRA and reporting it incorrectly","11582","","<p>I recently received a letter from the IRS based on my taxes for 2015.  I believe I did not understand the proper workings of a Roth IRA.  I was under the impression I could pull my money out and only report any distribution increases on my taxes.  For instance assume I had $1000 bucks in my Roth IRA. Let's say I only gained 10 bucks on it giving me $1010.  I previously thought a Roth IRA allowed me to withdraw my original $1000 without any penalty but if I were to withdraw any gains and not report it on my taxes that would be wrong.</p>

<p>In any event, I only had around $10000 on a new Roth IRA and at the time I ran into some financial issues.  I wasn't smart and had not saved in an emergency fund at the time (I know this was rather stupid of me considering I was putting in 15% of my salary in my 401k and putting money into my Roth IRA).  I don't need tips or a lesson on how this is important - lesson was learned at the time.</p>

<p>In any event in 2015 I had withdrew around $4750 of my own money (of which none of this had any gains) from my Roth IRA.  I did not report this as income because I thought this was already taxed, already my money, and no gains. </p>

<p>So yesterday I got a letter from the IRS stating I owe $1950 back to them.  Did I mess up?  Was I supposed to report this as income?  If I honestly messed up I will definitely pay it as I don't want to mess with the IRS and lesson learned.  In other words if I can avoid this I'd like to but I am all for doing the right thing.</p>

<h2>EDIT</h2>

<p>Back in 2015 when I first started doing my taxes I did not pay attention to form 1099-R.  I was an idiot and learned from my mistake.  I just went to fidelity's site and downloaded my 1099R and here is what it gave me:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rj7xI.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rj7xI.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I believe I did not put this value on my form.  I am confused now who I need to contact or how I should fix this.  Should I contact Fidelity or the IRS?</p>
","<p>There could be a few reasons for this, my first guess is that you didn't report the distribution on your return (indicated on line 15 of your 1040, pictured below), the IRS got a copy of the 1099-R, and assumes it's all taxable (or maybe the 1099-R indicates the full amount is taxable). If a 1099-R doesn't have an amount populated for 'taxable amount' it doesn't mean the distribution isn't taxable, and without any indication that it's not taxable the IRS assumes it is.</p>

<p>It's not taxable if it's a withdrawal of your contribution.</p>

<p>Here's a snippet from <a href=""https://www.fool.com/knowledge-center/how-to-calculate-the-taxable-amount-of-an-ira-with.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">How to Calculate the Taxable Amount of an IRA Withdrawal</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Withdrawals from a Roth IRA</strong><br> Since Roth IRA contributions are made on
  an after-tax basis, qualified withdrawals are completely tax-free. A
  ""qualified"" Roth withdrawal includes the following:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>A withdrawal of your original contributions at any time, for any
  reason.</li>
  <li>Any withdrawal from your account after you turn 59 1/2 years
  old and your account has been opened for five years or more.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>If your 1099-R indicates a taxable amount, then you might need to contact the issuer to understand why. If it does not indicate a taxable amount and you failed to record the distribution on your return, you just need to file an amended return that shows the distribution on line 15a and shows no taxable amount on 15b along with a completed Form 8606. </p>

<p>You may not need additional documentation to support of your claim that it's not taxable, but if you do it would be any statement showing that your contributions over the years exceed your withdrawal.</p>

<p>What a 1040 with a non-taxable IRA withdrawal would show:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wqo59.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wqo59.png"" alt=""1040_IRA""></a></p>

<p>Note: There'd also be a completed Form 8606, the 1040 lines above just show if it was entered in.</p>

<p>The easiest path forward is probably to file an amended return using turbotax since you filed with them originally. I haven't dealt with an IRS letter in a few years, I can't recall if you need to contact them or simply file the amended return, but they're pretty good about including instructions so the letter probably indicates what you need to do. Don't delay in taking action, as the IRS can and will garnish wages if they are owed (or think they are owed) money. </p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: OP contacted IRS and they didn't even want an amended return, just the completed Form 8606, so it's worth calling the IRS first with these letters.</p>

"If a country can just print money, is global debt between countries real?","11575","","<p>I was having a conversation with my brother last night and we were trying to figure out how exactly countries go into debt to each other. Say the US borrows money from China. What does this mean? Do they give us US dollars? Where do they get it? Can they just print/mint more yuan and give it to us? Is this even real? We couldn't figure out how it made any sense exactly.</p>

<p>For example if there was me, my brother, and my girlfriend in a room. My brother wanted to buy a soda from me for $1 but he didn't have it, so he borrowed it from her. She can give him $1 and then he buys the soda from me. But we can't create cash, so it works. But how does it work between countries when a country can just print/mint more money? What are they giving us and how do they know we will uphold the debt? Do we owe them yuan? How do they know what we owe them actually has value if it's not backed by anything?</p>

<p>So confusing. It seems like it's just smoke and mirrors!</p>
","<p>The debt is absolutely real. China loans money to US via buying the US treasury bonds. The bond is essentially a promise to pay back the money with interest, just like a loan.</p>

<p>As you point out, the US can print money. If this were to happen, then the USD that the owner of a treasury bond receives when the bond matures are worth less that than the USD used to purchase the bonds. There are lots of reasons why the US doesn't want to print lots of money, so the purchaser of the bond is probably confident it won't happen. If for some reason they think it is possible, then they will want to cover that risk by only purchasing bonds that have a higher interest rate. The higher interest offsets the risk of the USD being worth less.</p>

<p>Of course, there are lots more details, e.g., the bonds themselves are bought and sold before maturity, but this is the basic idea.</p>

<p>I wasn't able to answer my question from searching Money.SE by <a href=""/questions/tagged/balance"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged 'balance'"" rel=""tag"">balance</a> <a href=""/questions/tagged/amount"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged 'amount'"" rel=""tag"">amount</a> <a href=""/questions/tagged/subject"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged 'subject'"" rel=""tag"">subject</a> <a href=""/questions/tagged/interest"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged 'interest'"" rel=""tag"">interest</a> <a href=""/questions/tagged/calculation"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged 'calculation'"" rel=""tag"">calculation</a> <a href=""/questions/tagged/apr"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged 'apr'"" rel=""tag"">apr</a>&mdash;admittedly, I probably didn't know enough (or have enough context) to click the right links&mdash;but given that, most questions I found were about general APR calculations and certain nuances such as accounting for grace periods. After calling my bank, I found out that <em>Balance Subject To Interest Rate</em> (or <em>Amount Subject To Interest Rate</em>) is more commonly known as (or rather, computed by the method of) <em>Average Daily Balance</em>. With that knowledge I was able to answer my own question. Still, I thought I'd post the question (and my explanation) here in case future users might fumble around as I did, not knowing the proper terminology to search by.</p>

<h2>Takeaway (Why This Answer Might Be Useful To Others)</h2>

<p>At times I thought maybe it wasn't feasible to calculate the BSTIR/ASTIR/ADB by hand, but after these investigations it seemed not just feasible but even straightforward to calculate these things, <em>once familiar with billing cycles and prorating, as well as the handling of fees</em>.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Answers (High-Level, Descriptive)</h2>

<p><strong>The 1st month's transferred balance showed less than the actual amount transferred, due to prorating.</strong> That is, my balance transfer for $2,500 was processed about 1/3 of the way through the billing cycle; therefore the $2,500 was subject to interest only during the latter 2/3 of the billing cycle. (This would have been more obvious had the field been called ""Average Daily Balance."") <em>See below for actual calcuations.</em></p>

<p><strong>The 3rd month's transferred balance started decreasing due to payment; the minimum payment is applied to the balance with the lowest APR (in my case, the transferred balance) while the remainder is applied to the balance with the highest APR.</strong> This may not be true about <em>every</em> credit card, but I imagine it's very common. To verify, check your card member agreement or the fine print on your statement, or call customer service. <strong>Prorating applies here as well, according to the day in the billing cycle you made your payment.</strong>  <em>See below for actual calculations.</em></p>

<p>But then, shouldn't the balance have started decreasing in the <em>2nd</em> month? Why didn't the minimum payment for the 1st month apply to the transferred balance?</p>

<p>Initially, I thought perhaps that payments didn't begin applying to transferred or promotional balances until after a full billing cycle elapsed (or the statement thereafter was provided). However, this wasn't the case. <strong>The 2nd month's transferred balance <em>did</em> start decreasing: but what decreased was a hidden portion (the balance transfer <em>fee</em>, hidden because it was not subject to interest).</strong> <em>See below for actual calculations.</em></p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>All numbers above, including the number of days in the billing cycle, are transcribed from the actual statement, not derived or calculated (though of course reformatted) by me.</li>
<li>Always count inclusively when counting days in a range, <em>e.g.</em> 03/10 to 03/13 is <em>4</em> days.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, let's get started. The balance transfer was processed on 03/11. To the end of the billing cycle, 04/01, that's 22 days:</p>

<pre><code>Month   03                                                             04

</code></pre>

<p>That means the balance was only subject to interest for 22 out of the 31 days:</p>

<p>The last statement's minimum payment was $68. Again, I paid at least that amount, so that amount gets applied to the transferred balance, which, recall, was $2,534 (including the remaining portion of the balance transfer fee), making the new transferred balance $2,466, as of the payment date, 05/16.</p>

<p>And that payment date is important, because that's where the <em>Average Daily Balance</em> method kicks in:</p>

<pre><code>Month   05                                                                                        06

BSTIR   $2,500                                    $2,466
</code></pre>

<p>Note, again, that since the fee's not subject to interest<sup>&dagger;</sup>, the BSTIR is $2,500 (not $2,534) until it falls below $2,500.</p>

<p>We don't need to draw a calendar to do these calculations; I'm just drawing them in this case to be clear. Counting inclusively, there are 14 days between 05/02 and 05/15, and 18 days between 05/16 and 06/02, so the average daily balance is calculated as follows.</p>

<pre><code>( (14 * $2,500) + (18 * $2,466) ) / 32 = 2480.8750
</code></pre>

<p>The numbers check out, again!<sup>&Dagger;</sup></p>

<p><sup>&dagger;</sup> Not all credit cards / balance transfer offers consider fees exempt from interest. See further below for one such example.</p>

<p><sup>&Dagger;</sup> Unlike any impressions we may have gotten from grade school (American, at least), 2480.875 is neither ""closer"" to 2480.87 nor to 2480.88. In this case (or perhaps in accounting, in general; I wouldn't know, since I don't have an accounting background) the value seems rounded to the customer's advantage.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Further Examples</h2>

<p>Not all cards exempt fees from interest, <em>e.g.</em> the US Airways Dividend Miles Mastercard (Barclays). This doesn't matter of course for promotional 0 APR balance transfers, but it does matter if you're trying to reproduce the numbers on your statements. The following example also demonstrates a case in which a new account was created <em>for the balance transfer</em> (as opposed to transferring balances to an existing account); I had expected things to get screwy with billing cycles, but the calculations remained tame.</p>

<p>The balance transfer was processed on 11/26. To the end of the billing cycle, 12/06, that's 11 days. That means the balance was only subject to interest for 11 out of the 30 days:</p>

<pre><code>$4,000 * 11/30 = $1,466.6667
</code></pre>

<p>(11/30 is not a date; it's 11 divided by 30, in case that's not clear.) But wait, that doesn't check out! That's because this card considers the fee subject to interest rate. Instead, we have to do:</p>

<pre><code>$4,120 * 11/30 = $1,510.6667
</code></pre>

<p>Ah, there we go.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, I expected a more complex calculation due to having opened the account on 11/10. Since that's partway through the billing cycle, I thought the denominator should be 27 days rather than 30 days, so that my BSTIR would be higher than what it actually came out to be. Perhaps other credit cards do this; but this card did not, to the customer's advantage.</p>

"Why are interest rates on saving accounts so low in USA and Europe?","11409","","<p>For example, in USA interest rates are 1-2% percents, while in Russia it is normal to have up to 8% anually for US dollars account. Same goes for Euro. For Russian ruble it can be up to 12%, but with 10% annual inflation it is the same effectively. Can anyone explain such a difference?</p>
","<p>The United States Federal Reserve has decided that interest rates should be low. (They think it may help the economy. The details matter little here though.) It will enforce this low rate by buying Treasury bonds at this very low interest rate. (Bonds are future money, so this means they pay a lot of money up front, for very little interest in the future. The Fed will pay more than anyone who offers less money up front, so they can set the price as long as they're willing to buy.) At the end of the day, Treasury bonds pay nearly no interest.  </p>

<p>Since there's little money to be made with Treasuries, people who want better-than-zero returns will bid up the current-price of any other bonds or similar loan-like instruments to get what whatever rate of return that they can. There's really no more than one price for money; you can think of the price of those bonds as basically <code>(Treasury rate + some modifier based on the risk) percent</code>. </p>

<p>I realize thinking about bond prices is weird and different than other prices (you're measuring future-money using present-money and it's easy to be confused) and assure you it ultimately makes sense :)</p>

<p>Anyway. Your savings account money has to compete with everyone else willing to lend money to banks. Everyone-else lends money for peanuts, so you get peanuts on your savings account too. Your banking is probably worth more to your bank on account of your <strong>check-card payment processing fees</strong> (collected from the merchant) than from the money they make lending out your savings (notice how many places have promotional rates if you make your direct deposits or use your check card to make a purchase N times a month). </p>

<p>In Europe, it's similar, except you've got a different central bank. If Europe's bank operated radically differently for an extended period of time, you'd expect to see a difference in the exchange rates which would ultimately make the returns from investing in those currencies pretty similar as well. Such a change may show up domestically as inflation in the country with the loose-money policy, and internationally as weakness against other currencies. There's really only one price for money around the entire world. Any difference boils down to a  difference in (perceived) risk. </p>

"Different ways of looking at P/E Ratio vs EPS","11361","","<p>Would it be valid to assume that a stock with a low P/E ratio and also very high EPS is, generally speaking, a better purchase than a stock with that same P/E but lower EPS?</p>

<p>My reasoning for this is that if EPS is the denominator in the P/E ratio, then a higher denominator means potential future price increases will have less of an upward effect on the P/E than if the denominator was lower. That could mean the stock has more potential upside before it starts to look overvalued, which factors into overall demand. </p>

<p>Of course there are tons of other factors to consider -- but all other things being equal if you have two stocks, both with a P/E of 2, and one has an EPS of 5 whereas the other has an EPS of 10 is the latter a better purchase? </p>

<p>The flipside of this logic that I am wondering about is earnings growth potential. Obviously if EPS is expected to decrease or increase that has important implications. Is it possible that a stock with a high PE and relatively low EPS is a really good purchase if EPS growth is expected? I think I read a rationale along these lines in Burton Malkiel's book but I'm not positive -- since PE is a price-to-earnings multiple, you could look at it this way:</p>

<p>If a stock has a P/E of 8 and EPS is expected to increase $1, then price should actually increase by $8 assuming constant P/E. A similarly priced stock with a lower P/E of only 4 would only increase $4 with the same earnings increase. This is sort of a counter-intuitive attitude towards P/E since a higher P/E could actually be beneficial. </p>

<p>Is it valid to look at valuation ratios this way? The tricky part is that you have to assume certain values remain constant, I suppose. </p>
","<p>You could not have two stocks both at $40, both with P/E 2, but one an EPS of $5 and the other $10. </p>

<p>EPS = Earnings Per Share<br>
P/E = Price per share/Earnings Per Share</p>

<p>So, in your example, the stock with EPS of $5 has a P/E of 8, and the stock with an EPS of $10 has a P/E of 4. </p>

<p>So no, it's not valid way of looking at things, because your understanding of EPS and P/E is incorrect.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update:</strong><br>
Ok, with that fixed, I think I understand your question better.</p>

<p>This isn't a valid way of looking at P/E. You nailed one problem yourself at the end of the post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The tricky part is that you have to assume certain values remain
  constant, I suppose</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But besides that, it still doesn't work.</p>

<p>It seems to make sense in the context of investor psychology: if a stock is ""supposed to"" trade at a low P/E, like a utility, that it would stay at that low P/E, and thus a $1 worth of EPS increase would result in lower $$ price increase than a stock that was ""supposed to"" have a high P/E.</p>

<p>And that would be true. But let's game it out:</p>

<p><strong>Scenario</strong><br>
Say you have two stocks, ABC and XYZ. Both have $5 EPS.<br>
ABC is a utility, so it has a low P/E of 5, and thus trades at $25/share.<br>
XYZ is a high flying tech company, so it has a P/E of 10, thus trading at $50/share.</p>

<p>If both companies increase their EPS by $1, to $6, and the P/Es remain the same, that means company ABC rises to $30, and company XYZ rises to $60. Hey! One went up $5, and the other $10, twice as much! That means XYZ was the better investment, right? Nope.</p>

<p>You see, shares are not tokens, and you don't get an identical, arbitrary number of them. You make an investment, and that's in dollars. So, say you'd invested $1,000 in each.<br>
$1,000 in ABC buys you 40 shares.<br>
$1,000 in XYZ buys you 20 shares.<br>
Their EPS adds that buck, the shares rise to maintain P/E, and you have:<br>
ABC: $6 EPS at P/E 5 = $30/share. Position value = 40 shares x $30/share = $1,200<br>
XYZ: $6 EPS at P/E 10 = $60/share. Position value = 20 shares x $60/share = $1,200</p>

<p>They both make you the exact same 20% profit. It makes sense when you think about it this way: a 20% increase in EPS is going to give you a 20% increase in price if the P/E is to remain constant. It doesn't matter what the dollar amount of the EPS or the share price is. </p>

"What are the financial decisions leading to ""barn find"" automobiles?","11333","","<p>Where I live there are laws against leaving vehicles to rot in one's backyard or dumping them in the forest, mostly to prevent soil pollution and the junkyard appearance. I understand different countries have different sensitivities towards pollution and the environment. </p>

<p>But I'm really curious about the financial aspects of people buying cars and leaving them to rot for decades on their property. It seems to be quite frequent in the USA, see for example <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePrBt0SeSmQ"" rel=""noreferrer"">Hagerty's ""Barn find hunter"" show</a>.</p>

<p>Among these cars are some that were wrecks when they were ""stored"", but there are also ones that were running and intact, but were simply abandoned. How come the owner decided to simply let a piece of property (some of them not cheap! exotic Italian cars and all) turn to dust? </p>

<p>I understand that buying cars, especially exotic or rare ones, and storing them for the long term is a form of investment. But their values are orders of magnitude higher if they are in good condition. Most of the carcasses seen on this show have zero residual value.</p>

<p>So, what are the financial motivations of people who buy cars and leave them to rot?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> one thing I might be overlooking is that in the mid-20th century America, cars were crazy abundant and not very reliable so they had a pretty low second-hand value. As such they were effectively already worthless when they were parked and abandoned by their owners.</p>
","<p>If land is cheap with low opportunity cost for an alternative use (maybe you could pull an extra half bushel of corn or soybeans per year off a parking spot, or maybe not), so what?  At least you don't need to mow that patch.</p>

"How does tax withholding work for capital gains of selling stock?","11316","","<p>I am new in the United States, and before I moved here I did not deal with the concept of tax withholding and capital gains tax. I understand my employer withholds part of my salary to pay taxes, and I have to make sure that the amount that I pay via withholding must be close to the actual tax that I have to pay during the year, or I will pay underpayment penalty.</p>

<p>How does it work with capital gains? What I understand is I have to pay tax on gains when I sell stock or mutual funds. Does the broker or the funds manager withhold part of the money to pay the taxes (similar to what my employer does)? If not, do I just wait for April 15, or do I have to do something to avoid underpayment penalty (e.g. increasing my salary withholding)? Do I have to keep all record of transactions in order to calculate the gains and appropriate tax payment?</p>
","<p><strong>First a warning</strong>: if you're a foreigner you must familiarize yourself with the FATCA and FBAR requirements. Search this forum and ask questions if you don't know what these are. The penalties are horrifying and can drive you bankrupt even if you don't even owe a dime in taxes, just because you didn't attach a piece of paper to your tax return.</p>

<hr>

<p>To your question:</p>

<p>In the United States, brokers/banks do not withhold taxes from your gains (what is called ""at source""), it is your responsibility.</p>

<p>Taxes are due when the income is earned, i.e.: when you sell the stocks. Paying on April 15th next year may trigger late payment penalties. The right way to do it is using <a href=""http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/Estimated-Taxes"">estimated quarterly payments</a>.</p>

<p>However, since capital gains is not your only income but you also have salary, you have another option. Using <a href=""http://www.irs.gov/uac/Form-W-4,-Employee%27s-Withholding-Allowance-Certificate-1"">form W4</a>, you can adjust the withholding your employer takes out of your paycheck so that it will cover not only the salary itself but also the extra income you have through capital gains. If you do that, you do not need to do the quarterly estimates. You can use the worksheets in W4 instructions to calculate the exact number.</p>

<p>What you need to understand is that the employer doesn't withhold the actual tax, but rather what <em>you</em> think your actual tax <em>should</em> be given your situation. Using form W4 you can ask the employer to withhold more or less, and you can change your selection during the year if adjustments are required. Any tax paid through withholding is considered paid on time (even if all of it is paid on December 31st).</p>

<p>If you withheld too much, it balances out on your yearly tax return (the one due by the April 15th), and you get a refund from the IRS. If you withheld too little - you have tax due on April 15th and you pay it. As long as due is less than $1000 or whatever your tax liability was the year before - you won't have penalties (the $1000 delta refers to withholding only, if you paid through estimates and have tax due - you may get hit by penalties even if you owe less than $1000).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do I have to keep all record of transactions in order to calculate the
  gains and appropriate tax payment?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You need to keep all records as long as the tax year is open (statute of limitation is 3-6 years for most income tax issues), however it is advised to digitize your records and keep it <strong>forever</strong>. You'll need it in case of an audit or dispute with the IRS or the State taxing agency.</p>

<ul>
<li>Large Cap Equity </li>
<li>Small Cap Equity</li>
<li>International </li>
<li><strong>Fixed Income</strong> </li>
<li>Cash Investments</li>
</ul>

<p>I always seem to be slightly underinvested in the ""fixed income"" category, but I don't exactly understand what types of things that would qualify. </p>

<p>At first I thought CDs, but those seem more to fit into ""cash investments"", maybe bonds? I am a little stumped on this. Can anyone offer any insight? </p>
","<p>This is an excellent question.</p>

<p>The category of <strong>fixed income</strong> investments generally includes all kinds of <em>bonds</em> and <em>preferred shares</em> and other instruments that pay a <em>fixed rate of return</em> and are <em>expected to return your principal</em> by some maturity date.  The spectrum of fixed-income investing is wide.</p>

<p>For the fixed income component of a personal investment portfolio, I'd look to investing in <strong>high quality, short-term government bonds</strong> or index funds and ETFs composed of such.  Consider also holding some to protect against inflation &ndash; such as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasury%5Fsecurity#TIPS"">Treasury inflation-protected securities</a> (TIPS) in the U.S., or <a href=""http://www.bylo.org/rrbs.html"">Real Return Bonds</a> (RRBs) in Canada.</p>

<p>Corporate bonds, junk bonds, long term bonds, strip bonds, convertible bonds or debentures, and preferred shares ought to be avoided by investors who do not understand well the make-up and risks of such investments.</p>

<p>Also, <em>structured products</em> like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateralized%5Fdebt%5Fobligation"">CDOs</a> (collateralized debt obligations), <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset-backed%5Fcommercial%5Fpaper"">ABCP</a> (asset-backed commercial paper), <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage-backed%5Fsecurity"">MBS</a> (mortgage-backed securities), etc. should be avoided.  While originally marketed as high-quality fixed income investments, many structured products <strong><em>blew up</em></strong> during the credit crisis and left investors with a capital loss on their supposed ""safe"" investment.</p>

<p>On the subject of CDs / certificates of deposit (or GICs / guaranteed investment certificates in Canada):  Yes, they can be considered fixed income investments, in that they yield a fixed rate of return and are expected to return one's principal at maturity.</p>

<p>However, if a fixed income investment's maturity is short (e.g. less than one year), and the quality high (e.g. government paper or insured deposits), and it can be liquidated before maturity if desired (at slight penalty), then such a fixed income investment could instead be considered part of the <strong>cash or cash equivalents</strong> component in a portfolio, since there is little risk of significant loss of principal due to interest rate fluctuations, and the money is accessible if necessary.  Whereas, if a CD can't be sold before maturity, I would personally consider it fixed income yet <em>not</em> a cash equivalent until maturity.</p>

<p>I understand what convexity means in the context of bonds, but what exactly mean in the context of options, and how does that apply here (ie, the spread between realized and implied vol)?</p>
","<p><strong>First lets understand what convexity means:</strong></p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convexity_%28finance%29"">Convexity</a> - </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>convexity refers to non-linearities in a financial model. In other
  words, if the price of an underlying variable changes, the price of an
  output does not change linearly, but depends on the second derivative
  (or, loosely speaking, higher-order terms) of the modeling function.
  Geometrically, the model is no longer flat but curved, and the degree
  of curvature is called the convexity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay so for us idiots this means: if the price of ABC (we will call P) is determined by X and Y. Then if X decreases by 5 then the value of P might not necessarily decrease by 5 but instead is also dependent on Y (wtf$%#! is Y?, who cares, its not important for us to know, we can understand what convexity is without knowing the math behind it). So if we chart this the line would look like a curve.</p>

<p>(clearly this is an over simplification of the math involved but it gives us an idea)</p>

<p>So now in terms of options, convexity is also known as gamma, it will probably be easier to talk about gamma instead of using a confusing word like convexity(gamma is the convexity of options).</p>

<p><strong>So lets define Gamma:</strong></p>

<p><a href=""http://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gamma.asp#ixzz1yGeqhSix"">Gamma</a> - The rate of change for delta with respect to the underlying asset's price.</p>

<p>So the gamma of an option indicates how the <a href=""http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/delta.asp#axzz1y9sYMUTd"">delta of an option</a> will change relative to a 1 point move in the underlying asset. In other words, the Gamma shows the option delta's sensitivity to market price changes.</p>

<p><strong>or</strong></p>

<p>Gamma shows how volatile an option is relative to movements in the underlying asset.</p>

<p><strong>So the answer is:</strong></p>

<p>If we are long gamma (convexity of an option) it simply means we are betting on higher volatility in the underlying asset(in your case the VIX).</p>

<p>Really that simple? Well kinda, to fully understand how this works you really need to understand the math behind it. But yes being long gamma means being long volatility.</p>

<p>An example of being ""long gamma"" is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straddle"">""long straddle""</a></p>

<p><strong>Side Note:</strong></p>

<p>I personally do trade the VIX and it can be very volatile, you can make or lose lots of money very quickly trading VIX options.</p>

"What happens with an international transfer in a different currency than my own?","11139","","<p>My customers are in Germany and I told them to pay the money for me using a bank transfer.   I gave them the swift code and the IBAN and other information, but the problem is that I forgot to tell them that my account is in dollars and they transferred the money to my account using Euro.</p>

<p>Until now, I didn't receive a response from my bank in Turkey and they told me that the international transfer may take 4 or 5 days.</p>

<p>What do you think the result will be?</p>

<p>Is there an automatic conversation from Euro to dollar, or will my bank in Turkey will refuse to receive the money because they are in a different currency?</p>

<p>Will I lose my money?</p>
","<p>This is not a problem. SWIFT does not need the Beneficiary Account Currency. The settlement account [or the Instruction amount] is of interest to the Banks. As I understand your agreement with client is they pay you ""X"" EUR. That is what would be specified on the SWIFT along with your details as beneficiary [Account Number etc].</p>

<p>Once the funds are received by your bank in Turkey, they will get EUR. When they apply these funds to your account in USD, they will convert using the standard rates. Unless you are a large customer and have special instructions [like do not credit if funds are received in NON-USD or give me a special rate or Call me and ask me what I want to do etc].</p>

<p>It typically takes 3-5 days for an international wire depending on the countries and currencies involved. Wait for few more days and then if not received, you have to ask your Client to mention to his Bank that Beneficiary is claiming non-receipt of funds. The Bank that initiated the transfer can track the wire not the your bank which is supposed to receive the funds.</p>

"What exactly is a ""bad,"" ""standard,"" or ""good"" annual raise? If I am told a hard percentage and don't get it, should I look elsewhere?","11122","","<p>Is there a percentage threshold for a hypothetical ""bad,"" ""standard,"" or ""good"" annual raise?</p>

<p>I supposed a bad raise would be no raise at all and I hear a typical raise is around 3%, which barely keeps up with cost of living increases. </p>

<p>I recently had an annual review with my employer where I requested an increased salary. I was told that ""the money isn't in the budget right now but if it were up to me I would give you a substantial increase…we can revisit in the new calendar year when the new budget takes effect."" </p>

<p>When I pressed what ""substantial"" meant, I was told it was ""7%"". That would be an annual increase of over $5,000 dollars for me which would come in handy. </p>

<p>I of course think I deserve the money now, but if I don't get this hard number I was told (that is, if my increase is no increase at all or if it is around 4%) should I begin to look elsewhere? </p>
","<p>TLDR:  You will probably need to move to a different employer to get the raise you want/need/deserve.</p>

<p>Some employers, in the US, punish longevity through a number of practices.  My wife worked as a nurse for about 20 years.  During that time she had many employers, leveraging raises with job changes.  She quit nursing about 6 years ago and was being paid $38/hour at the time.  She had a friend that worked in the same system for 18 years.  They had the same position in the same hospital that friend's <strong>current</strong> rate of pay:  $26/hour.  You probably don't want to be that person.</p>

<p>Given your Stack Overflow participation, I would assume you are some type of web developer.  I would recommend updating your resume, and moving for a 20% increase or more.  You'll get it as it is a great time to be a web developer.  Spending on IT tends to go in cycles, and right now budgets are very healthy for hiring new talent.  </p>

<p>While your current company might not have enough money in the budget to give you a raise, they would not hesitate hiring someone with your skills at 95K if they had an opening.  Its common, but frustrating to all that are involved except the bean counters that looks at people like us as commodities.  </p>

<p>Think about this:  both sides of the table agree that you deserve a 5K raise.  But lets say next year only 3k is in the budget.   So you are out the 5k you should have been given this year, plus the 2k that you won't get, plus whatever raise was fair for you next year.  That is a lot of money!  Time to go!</p>

<p>Don't bother on holding onto any illusions of a counter offer by your current employer.  There will be too much resentment.  Shake the dust off your feet and move on.   </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
Some naysayers will cite short work histories as problems for future employment.  It could happen in a small number of shops, but short work histories are common in technology that recruiters rarely bat an eye.  If they do, as with any objection, it is up to you to sell yourself.  In <em>Cracking the Code Interview</em> the author cites that no one is really expecting you to stay beyond 5 years.  </p>

<p>Something like this would work just fine:  ""I left Acme because there were indications of poor financial health.  Given the hot market at the time I was able to find a new position without the worry of pending layoffs."" </p>

<p>If you are a contractor six month assignments are the norm.  Also many technology resumes have overlapping assignments.  Its what happens when someone is in demand.</p>

"Why I can't view my debit card pre-authorized amounts?","11094","","<p>I have a Mastercard debit card. When I pay an amount of money, I can see (with more or less delay) how much I've paid, when, in favor of who, etc.</p>

<p>Now the question is: why I can't see the pre-authorizations (or credit holds) that are pending on my debit card?</p>

<p>This is really disturbing. In August I've rent two bikes in Paris and now I have a 300€ pre-authorization pending on my debit card. I can't see it, I can't know when it will be lifted, but it's there.</p>

<p>Anybody has an explanation for this or it's just another banking trick to steal money (although temporarily) from customers?</p>
","<p>The simplest answer to why you can't see it in your online statement is a design/business decision that was made, most probably originally to make online statements differ as little as possible from old fashioned monthly printed statements; the old printed statements never showed holds either.</p>

<p>Some banks and card services actually do show these transactions online, but in my experience these are the rare exceptions - though with business/commercial accounts I saw this more, but it was still rare. This is also partly due to banks fearing lots of annoying phone calls from customers and problems with merchants, as people react to ""hey, renting that car didn't cost $500!"" and don't realize that the hold is often higher than the transaction amount and will be justified in a few days (or weeks...), etc - so please don't dispute the charges just yet.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, I've had bankers explain it to me thusly (the practice has bitten me before and it bothered me a lot, so I've talked to quite a few bankers about this):</p>

<p>There are two kinds of holds: ""soft holds"" and ""hard holds"". In a soft hold, a merchant basically asks the bank, ""Hey, is there at least $75 in this account?"" The bank responds, and then has it's own individually set policy per account type as to how to treat that hold. Sometimes they reserve no money whatsoever - you are free to spend that money right out and rack up NSF fees to your heart's content. Yet some policies are to treat this identically to a hard hold and keep the money locked down until released.</p>

<p>The hard hold is treated very much like an actual expenditure transaction, in that the money is locked and shown as no longer available to you. This varies by bank - some banks use an ""Account Balance"" and an ""Available Balance"", and some have done away with these dual terms and leave it up to you to determine what your balance is and what's ""available"" (or you have to call them).</p>

<p>The key difference in the hard hold and a real expenditure is, technically, the money is still in your bank account; your bank has merely ""reserved"" it, earmarking it for a specific purchase (and gently promising the merchant they can have their money later), but the biggest difference is there is a time-limit. If a merchant does not process a completion to the transaction to claim the money, your bank will lift the hold after a period of time (I've seen 7-30 days as typical in the US, again varying by institution) returning your money to your balance that is available for purchasing and withdrawal.</p>

<p>In every case, any vaguely decent banking institution allows you to call them, speak to some bank employee, and they can look up your account and inform you about the different sort of holds that are on your account that are not pending/completed purchase transactions.</p>

<p>From a strictly cynical (perhaps rightly jaded) point of view, yes this is also used as a method to extort absurdly high fees especially from customers who keep a low balance in their account. I have had more than one bank charge NSF fees based on available balances that were due to holds made by gas pumps, for instance, even though my actual ""money in my account"" never went below $0 (the holds were for amounts larger than the actual transaction). And yes, the banks usually would waive those fees if you bothered to get someone on the phone or in person and made yourself a nuisance to the right person for long enough, but they made you work for it. But I digress....</p>

<p>The reality is that there are lots of back and forth and middle-men in transactions like this, and most banks try to hide as much of this from you the client as possible, partly because its a huge confusing hassle and its part of why you are paying a bank to handle this nonsense for you to start with. </p>

<p>And, as with all institutions, rules and policies become easily adjusted to maximize revenues, and if you don't keep sizable liquid minimum balances (100% of the time, all year long) they target you for fees. </p>

<p>To avoid this without having fat wads of extra cash in those accounts, is use an entirely disconnected credit card for reservations ONLY - especially when you are traveling and will be making rentals and booking hotels. Just tell them you wish to pay with a different card when you are done, and most merchants can do this without hassle. Since it's a credit card with monthly billing you can often end up with no balance, no waiting around for a month for payments to clear, and no bank fees!</p>

<p>It isn't 100%, but now I never - if I can possibly avoid it - use my debit/bank card to ""reserve"" or ""rent"" <strong>anything, ever.</strong></p>

"Should I pay down my student debt early?","11014","","<p>I just graduated university and started my first job.  I have £50,000 in  student loan debt at 6.1% interest.</p>

<p>My monthly payment on this debt is £10 (direct from my paycheck).  I can afford to pay £200 a month, but should I?</p>

<p>I've heard that student loan debt is not considered a derogatory factor when being evaluated by a mortgage lender.  Is that true?</p>

<p>What if any problems will I encounter by continuing with the current payment situation?</p>
","<p>In the UK, supposing that this student debt is the government backed type debt and <em>not</em> private debt, then it will never be reported on your credit report and will not affect your chances of getting credit.</p>

<p>The student loan system in the UK is massively misunderstood by the general population and this lack of understanding is used for political aims by the media and political parties. Realistically the loans work like a graduate tax that stops when you have paid a certain amount. The interest rate is very low and capped by a function of the CPI measure of inflation and it is considered by credit analysts (I used to be one) as ""good debt"" meaning that it has at worst a positive effect on credit rating (it is actually normative in most cases). Paying it off early has some benefits in that it gives you more disposable income after paying off <em>but</em> this extra disposable income comes at a time when you have more disposable income anyway as you are earning more.</p>

<p>In terms of getting a mortgage the small monthly deduction from net income will have much less of an effect than your credit rating which, as mentioned above, this debt does not feature in. </p>

"The Benefits/Disadvantages of using a credit card","11001","","<p>Recently I was approved for my first credit card, and I was trying to find out the exact repercussions that using it would have on me, and my credit. </p>

<p>For now I've only been using the credit card for things I would buy normally and I pay them off almost immediately, usually once they post to my online account. However, I'm soon to be moving into an apartment and I'm contemplating using the card to furnish the apartment, paying it off over time, which I know is the point of the card.</p>

<p>What I'm wondering is, what kind of effects will usage like this have on my credit, and is it worth doing?</p>

<p>EDIT: There were more answers to this than I was ever expecting. Thanks for all of the responses. I got a lot of useful information from everyone. I ended up being inside of a 15 month grace period with no interest on purchases, so I did end up using the card more than I probably would have without that. That said, I'll be paying it all off today, and in the future this information is going to keep me from getting myself into a lot of trouble. </p>
","<p>There are a couple of things to consider.  </p>

<p>First, in order to avoid interest charges you generally just need to pay the statement balance before the statement due date.  This is your grace period.  You don't need to monitor your activity every day and send immediate payments.  If you're being really tight with money, you can actually make a little profit by letting your cash sit in an interest bearing account before you pay your credit card before the due date.</p>

<p>Second, credit card interest rates are pretty terrible, and prescribed minimum payments are comically low.  If you buy furniture using your credit card you will pay some interest, be sure to pay way more than the minimum payment.  You should avoid carrying a balance on a credit card.  At 20% interest the approximate monthly interest charge on $1,000 is $16.67.</p>

<p>Third, if you carry a balance on your credit card you lose the interest grace period (the first point above) on new charges.  If you buy your couch, and carry the balance, when you buy a soda at 7-11, the soda begins to accrue interest immediately.  If you decide to carry a balance on a credit card, stop using that card for new charges.  It generally takes two consecutive billing period full balance payments to restore the grace period.</p>

<p>Fourth, to answer your question, using a credit card to carry a balance has no impact on your score.  Make your payments on time, don't exceed your limits, keep your utilization reasonable.  The credit agencies have no idea if you're carrying a balance or how much interest you're paying.</p>

<p><strong>To Appease the people who think point four needs more words:</strong></p>

<p>Your credit report contains your limit, your reported balance (generally your statement balance), and approximate minimum payment.  There is no indication related to whether or not the balance contains a carried balance and/or accrued interest.  The mere fact of carrying a balance will not impact your credit score because the credit reporting bureaus don't know you're carrying a balance.  Paying interest doesn't help or hurt your score.  <strong>Obviously if your carried balance and interest charges push your utilization up that will impact your score because of the increased utilization.</strong> Make your payments on time, don't exceed your limits, keep your utilization reasonable and your score will be fine.</p>

I've looked around on a couple of google results, but most of the explanations just fly over my head, so I'd really appreciate if you can help me calculate these 3 inflation related things. I'm interested on the formulas themselves because I don't live in the US so most online inflation calculators don't really apply to my situation.</p>

<p>1) If I had a salary of $1000 five years ago AND on average the inflation was 10%, what's it's equivalent today?</p>

<p>2) If my salary is $1000 today, what would it's equivalent estimated value be in 5 years, if I expect inflation to be on average 12% yearly?</p>

<p>3) How do you adjust the price or value of an item to compensate inflation; eg: Say I have a house I paid 1 million dollars 3 years ago (ignore depreciation and other factors that can affect the asset's value), if inflation was: Y1 = 10%, Y2 = 11% and Y3 = 12%, what would the value of the house be?</p>

<pre><code>Present amount * (1+inflation%)^number of years
</code></pre>

<p>Am I on the right track or are there other factors I'm missing to solve my problem?</p>
","<p>The inflation has to be converted to a decimal, e.g. 10% inflation = .1</p>

<p>As for the questions you state:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The equivalent would be computed by taking 1.1 to the 5th power which yields 1.61051 so your salary equivalent would be $1,610.51 assuming dollars and cents like US and Canada.</p></li>
<li><p>Changing the percentage to 12 instead of 10, the value becomes $1,762.34.</p></li>
<li><p>In this case, it could be compounded by computing 1.1*1.11*1.12 = 1.36752, so the million dollar house is now worth $1,367,520.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Generally, the idea of inflation is the idea that prices will rise and thus one should be careful to be aware as to how much inflation will eat away at their investment returns.</p>

<p>That said, MANY ""wealthy"" people will spend WAY more than they have by going into debt.  This can be done through huge mortgages, personal loans using stock, real estate, or other assets as collateral, etc.  I don't know about Bezos specifically, but it's not uncommon for ""wealthy"" people to live beyond their means - they just have more assets behind them to secure personal loans, or bankers are more willing to lend them unsecured money because of the large interest rates they can charge.  Their assumption is presumably that the interest they'll pay on these loans is less than the earnings they'll get from the asset (e.g. stock, real estate).  While it may be true in some cases, it can also go bad and cause you to lose everything.</p>

","<p>A 100% stock dividend means that you get one share of the ""stock dividend"" for every share you own.</p>

<p>For example, Google did this in 2014 when they gave all of their Class A shareholders one class C share for every Class A that they owned.</p>

<p>If the 100% stock dividend is for the exactly the same stock, it is basically the same as a 2-for-1 stock split.</p>

<p>If, however, the 100% stock dividend is to give you a different stock, then this is typically due to a corporate reorganization or demerger/spinoff event.</p>

<p>Some countries have different tax treatments for the events - for example, with demergers in Australia, Class Rulings need to be obtained from the Australian Taxation Office to declare demergers as tax free.  A recent demerger was in Australia as South32, demerged from BHP Billiton.</p>

"Is there any financial benefit to being paid bi-weekly over monthly?","10898","","<p>I have read in many sources that it's generally better for an employee to be paid bi-weekly than monthly.  I have been performing some calculations and can't see the benefit to this.</p>

<p>Say I was on a $100,000 salary.  Let's assume a tax rate of 0% for the purposes of this calculation (I wish!).</p>

<p>Monthly payments are calculated like this:</p>

<pre><code>100000 / 12
= 8333.33 per calendar month
</code></pre>

<p>Bi-weekly payments are calculated like this (assuming non leap year):</p>

<pre><code>(100000 / 365) * 14
= 3835.61 per fortnight
</code></pre>

<p>Here's my analysis:</p>

<ul>
<li>Let's assume that bi-weekly payments always fall on a Monday.</li>
<li>Since the maximum number of days per month is 31, the first Monday of a month has to fall on either 1st, 2nd or 3rd of the month for there to be 3 payments in that calendar month (that's assuming of course that the first Monday of the month was a payday).</li>
<li>This means there will (usually) be 2 months in the year with 3 payments, while the remaining 10 months will only have 2 payments.</li>
<li>In the months with 2 payments (the majority), the sum of the 2 payments will be less than the payment I would receive if I was being paid monthly (using the figures above).</li>
</ul>

<p>As far as I can see, unless I was someone who was living from paycheque to paycheque, there's no real benefit to getting paid bi-weekly instead of monthly.</p>

<p>I thought that <em>maybe</em> if I was being paid into an offset account which was reducing interest on my mortgage, I'd be better off.  But my calculations (assuming interest is calculated daily) indicate that being paid monthly is still better off, because on a month by month basis my cumulative income is still higher when being paid monthly.</p>

<p>The only time I can see a benefit is if 1st January is a payday, then for the non leap-year case (365 days) the last paycheque will appear on 31st December.  This is one extra paycheque a year.  But this is not a common case.</p>

<p>Are my calculations correct?  Or are there benefits I'm not aware of here?</p>
","<p>Especially for people just starting out, without much reserve, the biggest concern is the rhythm of their expenses and income. If you're paid every two weeks, but your rent, car loan, and other ""big rocks"" are due once a month, then there are two paycheques a year that no-one has a claim on. Depending on your spending style, these can go into savings (yay!) or be spent on the spot and ""wasted"" (boo!). </p>

<p>Of course, you can get your mortgage set to every two weeks, and typically the bank will do that at the ""half your monthly payment"" level. If you're paid every two weeks, you won't feel any pain from this, but are making extra payments every year and getting out of the mortgage faster.</p>

<p>The time-value-of-money part has a small impact. The emotional part and fooling yourself into saving, or paying things off faster, has a bigger one.</p>

"First job: Renting vs get my parents to buy me a house","10885","","<p>Finished my studies and got my first job starting in Nov.</p>

<p>I'll have to move to a city far from where I currently live. I'll get paid around 17.5K/yr (1.4k/month net after taxes) and have to find a nice house to live in.</p>

<p>What I'm looking for is a relatively small house (just for me: 1 kitchen, 1 bedroom, 1 bathroom) which in the area I'll be working in is around $600/month or 200-230k to buy.</p>

<p>Given my family could buy it with savings (without a mortgage) is this a better option than renting with the money I'll be earning?</p>

<p>I'm planning to keep this work for 4 years, then probably move to another area (so we would have to sell the house or rent it to someone).</p>

<hr>

<p>I'm looking for an answer that sees me and my family as one. So it's not that I get a profit at their expense. It's more that we have our savings and can afford to buy a house for that price and then possibly sell it or rent it. The interest rate we get from savings in the bank is close to 0%, so our money is basically dying there.</p>

"Algorithmic trading in linux using python","10869","","<p>Is there any real time trading platform in linux in which one can test automated trading scripts written in python by ordering to a broker in a trial or demo account? Is IbPy the way to go? But IB does not offer any trial account.</p>
","<p>A couple options that I know of:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""http://www.interactivebrokers.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Interactive Brokers</a> offers a ""paper trading"" mode to its account holders that allows you to start with a pretend stack of money and place simulated trades to test trading ideas. They also provide an API that allows you to interface with their platform programmatically for retrieving quotes, placing orders, and the such. As you noted, however, it's not free; you must hold a funded brokerage account in order to qualify for access to their platform. In order to maintain an account, there are minimums for required equity and monthly activity (measured in dollars that you spend on commissions), so you won't get access to their platform without having a decent amount of skin in the game.</p>

<p>IB's native API is Java-based; IbPy is an unofficial wrapper that makes the interface available in Python. I've not used IB at all myself, but I've heard good things about their API and its accessibility via IbPy.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> IB now supports Python natively via their published API, so using IbPy is no longer needed, unless you wish to use Python 2.x. The officially supported API is based on Python 3.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://www.tdameritrade.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">TD Ameritrade</a> also offers an API that is usable by its brokerage clients. They do not offer any such ""paper trading"" mode, so you would need to ""execute"" transactions based on quotes at the corresponding trade times and then keep track of your simulated account history yourself. The API supports quote retrieval, price history, and trade execution, among other functions. TDA might be more attractive than IB if you're looking for a low-cost link into market data, as I believe their minimum-equity levels are lower.</p>

<p>To get access, you'll need to sign up for an API developer account, which I believe requires an NDA. I don't believe there is an official Python implementation of the API, but if you're a capable Python writer, you shouldn't have trouble hooking up to the published interfaces.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Some caveats: as when doing any strategy backtesting, you'll want to be sure to be pessimistic when doing so, so your optimism doesn't make your trades look more successful than they would be in the real world. At a minimum, you'll want to ensure that your simulations transact at the posted bid/ask prices, not necessarily the last trade's price, as well as any commissions and fees associated with the trade. A more robust scheme would also take into account the depth of the order book (also known as level 2 quotes), which can cause additional slippage in the prices at which you buy/sell your security. An even more robust scheme would take into account the potential latency of trade execution, looking at all prices over some time period that covers the maximum expected latency and simulating the trade at the worst-possible price. </p>

"How do people/companies buy/sell very large amounts of stock?","10867","","<p>I use <a href=""http://www.sharebuilder.com/"">Sharebuilder</a> for buying and selling stock.  Since I'm still only starting out, I don't have a lot in there (no more than a couple thousand), and my purchases have never been for more than a couple hundred dollars at a time.  I've always been curious how stock sales and purchases are handled with much higher volumes.  Can the well-known groups of online trading sites handle trades in the hundreds of thousands of dollars?  How about millions?  Is there some kind of special process that needs to be gone through for larger purchases, or does it not really make a difference?</p>
","<p>Do you mean kinda big amounts, or REALLY big amounts (like Warren Buffet-sized amounts)?</p>

<p>Stocks on the American markets are traded in lots of 100 shares (called ""round lots"").  For these amounts you can either call up a broker or go to an online brokerage and place your order in directly to the floor.  It's executed in seconds (usually) and you have your shares for a commission of a few bucks.</p>

<p>This is in contrast to what you're doing with Sharebuilder.  You can buy in less than 100-share increments, but you're paying more per share in the long run to do so because you're actually buying an allocation of a round lot from Sharebuilder.</p>

<p>If you're buying a whole lot of shares, then usually you have to do so gradually (and not tell anyone you're doing so, especially if you're Warren Buffet).  If you were to put an order for 1,000,000 shares at once, you could end up paying a lot more than you need to because it might not be the case that there are enough sellers to sell you 1,000,000 shares at near the current price.  The price will go up until your order is filled, but that could take a while.</p>

"""$100 Copay before deductible/40% Coinsurance after deductible""","10851","","<p>I'm shopping for health insurance. (U.S., federal exchange, I'll be losing COBRA which is a qualifying life event.) One of the plans describes its emergency room costs as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$100 Copay before deductible/40% Coinsurance after deductible</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This makes no sense to me. When coverage is described relative to a deductible, I presume I'm responsible for 100% until I hit the deductible.</p>

<p>Let's say I got a $2000 ER bill.</p>

<p>My presumption:</p>

<ul>
<li>If I haven't yet met the deductible, I'd be responsible for all $2000.</li>
</ul>

<p>The above description seems to say:</p>

<ul>
<li>If I haven't met my deductible, I'm responsible for a $100 copay.</li>
<li>If I have met my deductible (but not my maximum out-of-picket), I'm responsible for 40% * $2000 = $800.</li>
</ul>

<p>It makes no sense to me that my responsibility would be <em>smaller</em> before I met my deductible than after.</p>

<p>How would this really work?</p>

<p>(Added later) (but turns out to be irrelevant) Here are examples of how a similar plan (""$100 Copay before deductible/30% Coinsurance after deductible"") works, using the two standard coverage examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Amount owed to providers: $7,540</li>
<li>Deductibles: $2,000</li>
<li>Copayments: $20</li>
<li>Coinsurance: $740</li>
<li>Limits or exclusions: $150</li>
<li>Total paid by patient: $2,910</li>
</ul>

<p>(I have no idea how a plan with a $100 copay ends up in this example with a $20 copay. $740 is 30% of $2,466.67; I don't see where that number comes from.</p>

<ul>
<li>Amount owed to providers: $5,400</li>
<li>Deductibles $2,000</li>
<li>Copayments $400</li>
<li>Coinsurance $440</li>
<li>Limits or exclusions $80</li>
<li>Total $2,920</li>
</ul>

<p>(Similar mysteries apply.)</p>
","<p>Summary: The first ER trip is free (well, cheap). After that, ER trips start costing real money. (The language ""before deductible,"" though accurately transcribed, is misleading.)</p>

<p>I spoke to someone at the relevant insurance company. Yes, this is an unusual case where my responsibility is smaller before meeting the deductible than after ... sort of.</p>

<p>Say I need to go to the ER. Oh, well, sometimes that can't be avoided. The insurance company makes me responsible for a $100 copay for this first trip during my coverage period. Stuff happens; let's hope it doesn't happen again any time soon.</p>

<p>But now say I need to go to the ER a second time during my coverage period, or a third, or a fourth, or a fifth. This is either really bad luck or really bad personal management. Some people use the ER as their primary care provider. This is bad, and discouraged.</p>

<p>So now the insurance company doesn't cover the second, third, etc. ER trips at all until I meet the deductible. Even after meeting the deductible, the insurance company only pays 60% of the cost, leaving the remaining 40% of the cost at my doorstep. This stops once I've hit my my maximum out-of-pocket limit, but by the time I've hit that limit, I've been responsible for quite a lot.</p>

<p>Turns out the phrase ""$100 Copay before deductible/40% Coinsurance after deductible"" really doesn't make any sense. It would have been more accurate if the insurance company had said, ""$100 Copay for first visit/40% Coinsurance after deductible for successive visits.""

<p>I have seen similar scams before, but they send checks instead of money order or cashier check. I later learned that checks are not guaranteed for the payment, but cashier checks and money orders are, since they are made when the payer pays first to the finance institutes that issue cashier checks and money orders. So how can the quoted scam that promises to send me cashier check or money order work, I wonder?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>It's a scam. The cashier's check will be forged. Craigslist has a warning about it <a href=""http://www.craigslist.org/about/scams"">here (item #3).</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What kind of payment do you think is not fakable? Or at least not
  likely to be used in scams?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When on craigslist - deal only locally and in person. You can ask to see the person's ID if you're being paid by check</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When being paid by check, how can seeing his/her ID help? In case the
  check isn't cashable, I can find that person by keeping record of
  his/her ID? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you're paid by check, the payers details should be printed on the check. By checking the ID you can verify that the details match (name/address), so you can find the payer later. Of course the ID can be faked too, but there's so much you can do to protect yourself. You'll get better protection (including verified escrow service) by selling on eBay.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is being paid by cash the safest way currently,
  although cash can be faked too, but it is the least common thing that
  is faked currently? Do you recommend to first deposit the cash into a
  bank (so that let the bank verify if the cash is faked), before
  delivering the good? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>For Craigslist, use cash and meet locally. That rules out most scams as a seller.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What payment methods do you think are relatively safe currently?
  Then getting checks must be the least favorite way of being paid. Do
  you think cash is better than money order or cashier order? </p>

<p>You should only accept cash. If it is a large transaction, you can meet them at your bank, have them get cash, and you receive the cash from the bank.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Back to the quoted scam, how will they later manipulate me? Are they interested in
  my stuffs on moving sale, or in my money?</p>

<p>They will probably ""accidentally"" overpay you and ask for a refund of some portion of the overpayment. In that case you will be out the entire amount that you send back to them and possibly some fees from your bank for cashing a bad check.</p>

I see that biotechnology has a P/E ratio of 145, which is very high compared to other industries. What is so special about this industry that results in such a high P/E ratio?</p>

<p>I understand that the P/E of a particular company can be high related to its industry. But how can a whole industry be out of line with the other industries?</p>
","<p>If you look at the <a href=""http://biz.yahoo.com/p/515conameu.html"" rel=""nofollow"">biotech breakdown</a>, you'll find a lot of NAs when it comes to P/E since there are many young biotech companies that have yet to make a profit.  Thus, there may be something to be said for how is the entire industry stat computed.</p>

<p>Biotechnology can include pharmaceutical companies that can have big profits due to patents on drugs.</p>

<p>As an example, look at Shire PLC which has a P/E of 1243 which is pretty high with a Market Capitalization of over a billion dollars, so this isn't a small company.  I wonder what dot-com companies would have looked like in 1998/1999 that could well be similar as some industries will have bubbles you do realize, right?</p>

<hr>

<p>The reason for pointing out the Market Capitalization is that this a way to measure the size of a company, as this is merely the sum of all the stock of the company.  There could be small companies that have low market capitalizations that could have high P/Es as they are relatively young and could be believed to have enough hype that there is a great deal of confidence in the stock.  For example, Amazon.com was public for years before turning a profit.  In being without profits, there is no P/E and thus it is worth understanding the limitations of a P/E as the computation just takes the previous year's earnings for a company divided by the current stock price.  If the expected growth rate is high enough this can be a way to justify a high P/E for a stock.  The question you asked about an industry having this is the derivation from a set of stocks.  If most of the stocks are high enough, then whatever mean or median one wants to use as the ""industry average"" will come from that.</p>

Salary, vacation and 401k matching have been factored in.  However, I am having trouble with my pension and how to value it.  The company I currently work for has a pension program (it's been frozen to no longer allow new employees to enter) while the prospective future company does not.</p>

<p>Due to my youth and years put into the program the amount of money seen from the aforementioned pension would be minimal currently; however, if I were to work at this company until retirement it would be a large chunk of money every month.</p>

<p>What is the best way to factor this in when making a counter-offer?  By that I mean, when moving from a company with a pension to one without how do I determine its worth?</p>
","<p>I am in a similar situation and have recently found a planner who says a pension that pays $100/month is worth $18k in savings at retirement.

<li>Amount I would need to save per month @%6 simple interest for the 12 years until I reach age 60=about$1200/month pre tax money.</li>

Should I use the stock money to pay my debt, and be debt free.  The debt is not high interest.  Just a few loans: car loan 4%, student loan 2.75%, misc loan 10% (low balance)</p>

<p>Ideas?</p>
","<p>Simply put, the interest you're paying on your loans is eating into any gains you have in the stock market.  So, figure out how much you're paying in interest and consider the feasibility of paying off some of the loan.  Also figure in if you would be selling the stock at a profit or a loss.  </p>

<p>Generally speaking, a home loan is typically long-term, with a high principal.  I believe the consensus is that it is typically not worth paying down extra on it.  A car loan, though, is much shorter term, with a lower principal.  It may be worth it to pay that down.</p>

<p>I would certainly consider paying down the loan with 10% interest, even without running any numbers.</p>

<p>What about doing this without selling stock?  The reason I suggest that is that you should not sell the stock unless you truly need the money or for some material reason(s) related to the company, the market, etc.  (Of course, one other reason would be to cut losses.)</p>

<p>Unless I was looking to sell some stock anyway, I would try other ways to come up with the money to pay down the highest interest loan, at least.  If you are thinking of selling stock to pay down debt, definitely run the numbers.</p>

"Should I pay off my 50K of student loans as quickly as possible, or steadily? Why?","10543","","<p>I was an idiot in college. I basically just used student loans and got very few grants.  I also spent way too much time in there.  I now have two bachelor's degrees and a master's degree.  About 7 years of my life wasted and about 50K dollars in student loans.  Extremely stupid waste of money.</p>

<p>I am trying to pay off these student loans as quickly as possible.  Here are some specifics:</p>

<ul>
<li>I currently earn about $65K per year before taxes.</li>
<li>I live in a blue state so they tax the hell out of you up here. I take home about 69% of what I earn.  So my real pay is about $46K per year.  Which isn't a whole lot of money, I am finding out.</li>
<li>I already pay about $650/month in student loans and $725/month in rent.  I pay about $50/m for cable, $50/m for internet, $90/m for cell phone. I try to keep my food intake under $250/m but that is hard.</li>
<li>Add a couple of other expenses per month and I am already over half my monthly salary.  Which isn't too bad.  I guess I need to figure where else I am bleeding, and step on the hose?</li>
</ul>

<p>I guess if I could pay an extra thousand a month to these student loans in a round robin fashion, I could be able to pay them off rather quickly?</p>

<p>Would it be better for me to pay these off as quickly as possible, or to save that money and still pay them off steadily?  What would be a good course of action, and why?</p>
","<p>The definitive answer is: It Depends.</p>

<p>What are your goals?</p>

<p>First and foremost, you need to have at least 3 months expenses in cash or equivalent. (i.e. an investment that you can withdraw from quickly, and without penalty).  The good news is that you don't have to come up with it instantly.  Set a time frame - one year - for creating this safety net, and pay towards that goal.  This is the single most important piece of financial advice you will receive.</p>

<p>Now determine what you need to do.  For example, you may need a car.  Compare interest rates on your student loan and the car loan.  Put your cash towards whichever is higher.</p>

<p>If you don't need a car or other big ticket item, then you may consider sticking your surplus into the student loans.  50k at $1650 a month will be paid down in about 3 years, which might be a bit long to live the monastic lifestyle. I'd look at paying down the smallest loan first (assuming relatively similar rates), and freeing up that payment for yourself.  So if you can pay off 1650 a month, and free up $100 of that in six months, then you can reward yourself with half that surplus, and apply the other half to the next loan.   (This is different than some would suggest because you're talking about entering severe spartan mode, which is not sustainable.)  </p>

<p>Remember that life happens.  You'll meet someone.  You'll have an accident, your brother will get sick and you'll give him some money to help out.  You've got to be prepared for these events, and for these reasons, I don't recommend living that close to the edge.

"How can I make ""four equal"" quarterly tax payments when I don't know what my income will be?","10530","","<p>I'm running my own business for the first time and I noticed while filing my first quarter's estimated taxes that the instructions ask you to make ""four equal payments"" throughout the year.</p>

<p>But many people (freelancers, business owners) don't know precisely how much money they'll make throughout the year. How can you be expected to pay exactly x * 0.25 if you don't know what x is?</p>
","<p>The heart of the question is: why can't Bill just pay whatever he owes based on his income in that quarter? If Q2 is gang busters, he'll increase his tax payment. Then if Q3 is surprisingly slow, he'll pay less than he paid in Q2.</p>

<p>I think what's most interesting about this question is that the other answers are geared towards how a taxpayer is supposed to estimate taxes. But that's not my objective -- nor is it Bill's objective.</p>

<p>My [his] real objective is: </p>

<ol>
<li>Don't substantially overpay taxes.</li>
<li>Don't get reamed on underpayment penalties.</li>
</ol>

<p>In other words, the answer to this question either needs to deal with not overpaying, or it needs to deal with mitigating the underpayment penalty.</p>

<p>AFAICT, there are 2 solutions:</p>

<p><strong>Solution 1</strong></p>

<p>Figure your estimated taxes based on last year's tax. You won't owe a penalty if your withholding + estimated tax payments in each quarter are 25% or more of your previous year's tax liability.</p>

<p>Here's the section that I am basing this on:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.irs.gov/publications/p505/ch04.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.irs.gov/publications/p505/ch04.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Minimum required each period.</strong>   You will owe a penalty for any 2011 payment period for which your estimated tax payment plus your withholding for the period and overpayments for previous periods was less than the smaller of:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li><p>22.5% of your 2011 tax, or</p></li>
  <li><p>25% of your 2010 tax. (Your 2010 tax return must cover a 12-month period.)</p></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Solution 2</strong></p>

<p>Use the ""Annualized Income Installment Method"". This is <em>not</em> a method for calculating estimated taxes, per se. It's actually a method for <em>reducing or eliminating your underpayment penalty</em>. It's also intended to assist tax payers with unpredictable incomes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you did not receive your income evenly throughout the year (for example, your income from a shop you operated at a marina was much larger in the summer than it was during the rest of the year), you may be able to <strong>lower or eliminate your penalty</strong> by figuring your underpayment using the annualized income installment method.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Emphasis added.</p>

<p>In order to take advantage of this, you'll need to send in a Schedule AI at the end of the year along with a Form 2210. The downside to this is that you're basically racking up underpayment penalties throughout the year, then at the end of the year you're asking the IRS to rescind your penalty.</p>

<p>The other risk is that you still pay estimated taxes on your Q2 - Q4 earnings in Q1, you just pay much less than 25%. So if you have a windfall later in the year, I think you could get burned on your Q1 underpayment.</p>

"To pay off a student loan, should I save up a lump sum payoff payment or pay extra each month?","10407","","<p>I am a new college graduate with a student loan of $17k at 6.8% interest. The monthly minimum payment due is $193. I have been paying the minimum amount, and then taking that same amount and placing it into a savings account. </p>

<p>My original idea was to keep paying the minimum amount, and then saving the same amount until the total amount in the savings account was equal to the amount left on the loan. When the two amounts are equal I plan on paying off the entire amount. Is this a bad plan? </p>

<p>I am currently in the position to be paying more than the minimum, but I am trying to establish a nice lump sum in the bank for myself.</p>

<p>Thank you, I really appreciate any help/guidance with this.</p>
","<p>As a new graduate, aside from the fact that you seem to have the extra $193/mo to pay more towards your loan, we don't know anything else. </p>

<p>I wrote a lengthy article on this in response to a friend who had a loan, but was also pondering a home purchase in the future. <a href=""http://www.joetaxpayer.com/student-loans-and-your-first-mortgage/"">Student Loans and Your First Mortgage</a> discusses the math behind one's ability to put a downpayment on a house vs having that monthly cash to pay towards the mortgage. In your case, the question is whether, in 5 years, the $8500 would be best spent as a home down payment or to pay off the 6.8% loan. </p>

<p>If you specifically had plans toward home ownership, the timing of that plan would affect my answer here, as I discuss in the article. </p>

<p>The right answer to your question can only come by knowing far more of your personal situation. </p>

<ul>
<li>Does your employer offer a matched 401(k) (or other matched retirement account if you are not in the US), and are you depositing the full amount to capture that match? It makes little sense to set aside funds to pay off a 6.8% loan if you are leaving a 50 or 100% match on the table. </li>
<li>Do you have any other high interest debt? 18% card takes priority over this loan.</li>
<li>What is the nature of your current savings and rate of savings? An emergency fund or funds that would take care of unexpected expenses, including bridging the gap during a time of unemployment is an important first step for the new grad. Start by hitting the first $1000, $2000, etc. But ultimately, you want X months worth of expenses to have a true safety net. </li>
</ul>

<p>Meanwhile, the plan comes at a cost. Your plan will get rid of the loan in about 5 years, but if you simply double up the payments, advising the servicing company to apply the extra to principal, it would drop to just a couple month over over 4. As you read more about personal finance, you'll find a lot of different views. Some people are fixated on having zero debt, others will focus on liquidity. In the end, you need to understand each approach and decide what's right for you.  </p>

<p>Recently I've been suckered into getting store credit cards (Macy's, Kohl's, etc) because they offer a discount when you sign up. </p>

<p>I'm curious if it's bad to have too many credit cards, even if I keep all of the balances paid in full and under control? </p>
","<p>According to Clark Howard.  The best mix is to have at least two reward cards for no other reason than rewards, but you actually should have more as far as credit score goes. </p>

<p>30% of your credit score is based on how much of your credit that you use.</p>

<p>I had only 17k in credit.  I usually spend 6k a month and pay it off every month.  I went to 4 credit cards got the total line up to over 40k and because my usage went down to about 12% of total credit, my credit score went up about 40 points to mid 700's after two months</p>

<p>Long story short the more credit cards you have the better for your credit score.  You should use each one twice a year to keep them active. (Not relevant for a store credit card, you don't want to buy something from macy's for the sake of keeping the card active)</p>

"How does stabilization work during an IPO?","10396","","<p>When Facebook went public, the price didn't rise like a normal IPO. Normally, IPO's are priced so that there's a ""pop"" on the opening day. Instead the Facebook price fluctuated around the initial price and once support was removed, the price fell below the offering price.</p>

<p>According to the Wall Street Journal:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""As the deal's so-called stabilizing agent, Morgan Stanley could
  support the stock through a pool of Facebook shares known as a
  overallotment.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this context, ""support"" means keep the stock price higher than it otherwise would be.  I see how Morgan Stanley could keep the price lower by releasing more shares from an overallotment pool, but how can they ""support"" the stock price?</p>
","<p>There are no ""rules"" about how the price should act after an IPO, so there are no guarantee that a ""pop"" would appear at the opening day. But when an IPO is done, it's typically underpriced. On average, the shares are 10% up at the end of the first day after the IPO (I don't have the source that, I just remember that from some finance course).</p>

<p>Also, after the IPO, the underwriter can be asked to support the trading of the share for a certain period of time. That is the so called stabilizing agent. They have few obligations like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Providing liquidity to avoid strong price movement.</li>
<li>Supporting the price by buying the share below a certain level.</li>
</ul>

<p>This price support in often done by a <strong>repurchase of some of the shares</strong> of poorly performing IPO.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT: Informations about the overallotment pool</strong>.</p>

<p>When the IPO is done, a certain number of client buy the shares issued by the company.</p>

<p>The underwriter, with the clients, can decide to create an overallotment pool, where the clients would get a little more shares (hence ""overallotment""), but this time the shares are not issued by the company but by the underwriter. To put it another way, <strong>the underwriter oversell</strong> and becomes short by a certain number of shares (limited to 15% of the IPO).</p>

<p>In exchange for the risk taken by this overallotment, the underwriter gets a <strong>greenshoe option</strong> from the clients, that will allows the underwriter to buy back the oversold shares, at the price of the IPO, from the clients. The idea behind this option is to avoid a market exposure for the underwriter.</p>

<p>So, after the IPO:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If the <strong>price goes down</strong>, the underwriter <strong>buys back on the market</strong> the overshorted shares and makes a profits.</p></li>
<li><p>If the <strong>price goes up</strong>, the company <strong>exercise the greenshoe option</strong> buy the shares at the IPO prices (throught the overallotment pool, that is, the additional shares that the clients wanted ) to avoid suffering a loss.</p></li>

","<p>This seems like a risky setup.  All it takes is one missed or delayed transfer for you to overdraw your ""savings"".  There is a benefit to keeping your <em>regular</em> expenses and savings separate, and I can see some benefits in having multiple <em>checking</em> accounts depending on how you organize your finances, but I don't see a benefit to having a paycheck go to one account and all regular spending (and ""savings"") come from another.  It requires some regular maintenance to transfer money over to use for regular spending.  I suppose if you have a checking account that earns interest, but requires direct deposits, and a savings account that earns <em>slightly higher</em> interest you could squeeze out a bit, but it's probably not worth the effort these days unless you have a <em>LOT</em> of money going in and out.</p>

<p>Also, it should not be easy to tap into savings, but your day-to-day spending should be very accessible.  All those factors suggest (to me) that your paycheck should go into your regular spending account, and keep your <em>savings</em> separate.</p>

  logo.</li>
  <li>Expect a credit check. Some companies will perform a debit card check and credit inquiry to ensure that you have the proper funds.
  (Keep in mind, credit inquiries show up on your credit report, and too
  many inquiries can actually lower your credit score.)</li>
  <li>Be patient. The process of paying with a debit card will likely be a longer one. It takes time to check your credit and insurance, verify
  your ID, etc.</li>
  <li>Prepare to pay a deposit. Often times, rental car companies place a hold on the account linked to your card. It’s basically a deposit
  that they’ll hold until you return the vehicle. These deposits can be
  $200 or more.</li>
  <li>Limited choice. No credit card often means you lose the option of renting luxury cars, SUVs or other specialty vehicles.</li>
  <li>Outside of the U.S. - Debit cards may not be accepted at locations outside of the United States. Please check terms and conditions for
  the specific country or location of rental.</li>

  <p><em>What is my cost basis for the warrants and common stock I received from the MLC bankruptcy?</em></p>
  
  <p>The receipt of new GM stock and warrants by Motors Liquidation Company (MLC) bondholders was generally not a taxable event. Your historic cost basis in your Motors Liquidation Company debt is your basis in the GM stock and warrants received. <strong>The basis should be spread to the assets received pro rata based on value.</strong> [jms: my emphasis] You may want to seek the advice of a tax advisor and or your financial advisor for assistance in determining your cost basis and allocation between the various assets received, or if you received additional assets from MLC.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gee, thanks GM, that really clears up the situation.</p>

<p>The only other document I could find is this <a href=""http://www.wilmingtontrust.com/gmbondholders/d_rate_chart.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">distribution chart for Motors Liquidation Company</a>. My bonds were XGM 7.25% 7/41 = CUSIP 370442774, so it says 0.095935 stock, 0.087214 A Warrants, and 0.087214 B warrants per unit outstanding, but that only helps me know how much of each class I should have received, which I already know -- and not how to compute the cost basis allocation.</p>

<p>Could anyone else tell me where to look to find out how to allocate my cost basis in GM shares and warrants? (e.g. is it 50%/25%/25% or 40%/30%/30% or what ?)</p>
","<p>This is a bit complicated because of all the moving parts, but is a little simpler because the two warrants are now publicly traded.  The main rule appears to be that your cost should be apportioned into the bases for the pieces you received by the proportions of the prices established in the market on the first day of trading in which they trade separately (source: <a href=""http://www.costbasis.com/stockchanges/stockwarrants.html"" rel=""nofollow"">costbasis.com</a>).  Since the A and B GM warrants began trading in March 2011 (at least that's what a quick search shows), use their prices and the GM price on the same day to establish the proportions.  You also must include the factor of how much of each piece you received for each of your bonds.</p>

<p>So, for example, if the prices of GM, WSA, and WSB, were $32, $23, and $17 on the first day of trading, and you got 3 shares GM, 2 A warrants, and 1 B warrant for your bonds, their worth on first day of separate trading would be:</p>

<pre><code>w(GM)  = 3*32 = 96
w(WSA) = 2*23 = 46
w(WSB) = 1*17 = 17
total          159
</code></pre>

<p>and so the proportion of your bond cost to be allocated to your A warrants, for instance, would be 46/159 or about 28.9% using these example figures.</p>

<p>The small dribbles of additional securities you have received already, I would include in the calculation above, and if you in the future receive any further dribbles, I would assign them a basis of $0 (as your full bond cost would have already been completely allocated).</p>

"Transferring money from 403B to 401K?","10062","","<p>I worked for an employer with a 403b and contributed, but my new employer only does 401k.</p>

<p>Can I put the money from the 403b into the 401k? How?</p>
","<p>You <em>can</em> move money from a 403b to a 401k plan, but the question you should ask yourself is whether it is a wise decision. Unless there are specific reasons for wanting to invest in your new employer's 401k (e.g. you can buy your employer's stock at discounted rates within the 401k, and this is a good investment according to your friends, neighbors, and brothers-in-law), you would be much better off moving the 403b money into an IRA, where you have many more choices for investment and usually can manage to find investments with lower investment costs (e.g. mutual fund fees) than in a typical employer's 401k plan.
On the other hand, 401k assets are better protected than IRA assets in case you are
sued and a court finds you to be liable for damages; the plaintiff cannot come after
the 401k assets if you cannot pay. </p>

<p>To answer the question of ""how?"", you need to talk to the HR people at your <em>current</em>
employer to make sure that they are willing to accept a roll-over from another
tax-deferred plan (not all plans are agreeable to do this) and get any paperwork
from them, especially making sure that you find out <em>where</em> the check is to be sent,
and to whom it should be payable. Then, talk to your <em>previous</em>
employer's HR people and tell them that you want to roll over your 403b money
into the 401k plan of your new employer, fill out the paperwork, make sure they
know to whom to cut the check to, and where it is to be sent etc. In <em>my</em>
personal experience, I was sent the check payable to the custodian of my new (IRA)
account, and I had to send it on to the custodian; my 403b people refused to
send the check directly to the new custodian.</p>

<p>The following January, you will receive a 1099-R form from your 403b plan
showing the amount
transferred to the new custodian, with hopefully the correct code letter
indicating that the money was rolled over into another tax-deferred account.</p>

"How do exchanges match limit orders?","10041","","<p>Say a security has been trading at under $20.10, and there are limit orders selling at $20.10 and $20.21. Then Simon issues a limit order to buy at $20.21. According to <a href=""http://www.chrisstucchio.com/blog/2012/hft_apology.html"">this explanation</a>, Simon would end up buying shares at $20.10.</p>

<p>Why does the exchange favor the buyer here?  I.e., why does the transaction execute at the seller's limit of $20.10 instead of the buyer's limit of $20.21?  (I.e., why don't Inara/River get to sell at $20.21 / above their limit, but Simon gets to buy at $20.10 / below his limit?)  Is the example flawed?</p>

<p>If it makes a difference, I'm mainly curious about NASDAQ and NYSE.  I tried Googling for specs (e.g. <a href=""http://www.nasdaq.com/about/market_mechanics.pdf"">this</a>), but couldn't find anything.  Only found that some <a href=""http://archfirst.org/apps/bfexch-javaee/concordion/org/archfirst/bfexch/spec/matchingengine/MatchingLimitOrders.html"">random limit order book</a> implementation executes the average of the buy/ask.  Just curious how the system works.</p>
","<p>The Limit Order are matched based on amount and time. The orders are listed Highest to Lowest on the Buy Side. The orders are listed Lowest to Highest on the Sell Side. If there are 2 Sell orders for same amount the order which is first in time [fractions of milliseconds] is first.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gYU2g.jpg"" alt=""Buy-Sell""></p>

<p>The about is the example as to how the orders would look like on any exchange. 
Now the highest price the buyer is ready to pay is 20.21 and the lowest price a seller is ready to sell for is 20.25. Hence there is no trade.<br>
Now if a new Buy order comes in at 20.25, it matches with the sell and the deal is made.<br>
If a new Buy order comes in at 20.30, it still matches at 20.25.<br>
Similarly if a Sell order come in at 20.21, it matches and a deal is made.<br>
If a Sell order come in at 20.11, it still matches 20.21.  </p>

<p>Incase of market order, with the above example if there is a Buy order, it would match with the lowest sell order at 20.25, if there is not enough quantity , it would match the remaining quantity to the next highest at 20.31 and continue down. Similarly if there is a Sell market order, the it would match to the maximum a seller is ready to buy, ie 20.21, if there is not sufficient buy quantity at 20.21, it will match with next for 20.19  </p>

<p>If say there are new buy order at 20.22 and sell orders at 20.24, these will sit first the the above queue to be matched.</p>

<p>In your above example the Lowest Sell order was at 20.10 at time t1 and hence any buy order after time t1 for amount 20.10 or greater would match to this and the price would be 20.10.<br>
However if the Buy order was first ie at t1 there was a buy order for 20.21 and then at time later than t1, there is a sell order for say 20.10 [amount less than or equal to 20.21] it would match for 20.21.<br>
Essentially the market looks at who was the first to sell at lower price or who was the first to buy at higher price and then decide the trade. </p>

<p>Edit [To Clarify xyz]:<br>
Say if there is an Sell order at $10 Qty 100. There is a buyer who is willing to pay Max $20 and is looking for Qty 500. Your key assumption that the Buyer does not know the current SELL price of $10 is incorrect.<br>
Now there are multiple things, the Buyer knows the lowest Sell order is at $10, he can put a matching Buy order at $10 Qty 100, and say $11 Qty 100 etc. This is painful.<br>
Second, lets say he puts a Buy order at $10 Qty 100, by the time the order hits the system someone else has put the trade at $10 and his order is fulfilled. So this buyer has to keep looking at booking and keep making adjustments, if its a large order, it would be extremely difficult and frustrating for this Buyer. Hence the logic of giving preference.<br>
The later Buy order says ... The Max I can pay is $20, match eveything at the current price and get the required shares. </p>

"Tax implications of 401k regular rebalancing vs a retirement target fund","10041","","<p>This question is in the context of securities held within a 401k. </p>

<p>As I understand it, one of the advantages of a retirement target date fund (like Fidelity's FFFHX, which I am in 100%) is that the fund automatically adjusts its holdings to become more conservative as the target date approaches. This fund has an expense ratio of 0.77%.</p>

<p>For comparison, I looked at two other funds available in a Fidelity 401(k) - the Spartan 500 Index Fund (FUSVX - expense ratio of 0.03%) and the Spartan U.S. Bond Index Fund - Fidelity Advantage Class (FSITX - expense ratio of 0.17%).</p>

<p>Assuming I were to be comfortable regularly (yearly-ish?) rebalancing my portfolio both by changing the percentage of my 401(k) contributions in each fund as well as rebalancing principal as I grow closer to retirement, there seems to be an advantage in this ""do it yourself"" approach with regards to fees.</p>

<p>However, what about taxes? This is something I can't quite wrap my head around. If I rebalance regularly I would expect to incur some sort of tax liability. On the other hand, if I invest in a fund which rebalances itself automatically, would there be any tax implications for me when the fund rebalances? As a result, are such funds a better bet when it comes to taxes?</p>

<p>Ultimately, is there a way to calculate whether a self-reblancing fund with a higher expense ratio that (may) shield me from taxable events (in rebalancing) is worth the premium?</p>
","<p>A 401(k) is tax-deferred. Rebalancing assets in a 401(k) is not a taxable event.</p>

<p>In a taxable non-retirement account, you would figure out what investments have the best return after taxes. In a tax-advantaged account (like a 401(k), Roth 401(k), IRA, or Roth IRA) you simply figure out what investments have the best return. This is why some people advise putting tax-inefficient assets (like bonds) into tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient assets (like stocks) into your regular non-retirement accounts.</p>

"What college degree should I pursue to learn about stock and forex markets?","10031","","<p>What college degree should I pursue to learn the fundamentals of the stock market? Are there way to understand how stocks and foreign exchange markets work, including their strategies and drawbacks?</p>
","<p>There are several paths of study you could undertake. If you want to learn the fundamentals of the stock market and become a financial analyst, then finance, economics, and accounting (yes, accounting) are all good to study either on your own or in an institution. Furthermore, if you want to study a specific industry, it can't hurt to know a fair amount of the science behind that particular industry. For example, if you want to understand the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries, knowledge of clinical trials, the FDA's approval process (in the US, at least), off-label uses for drugs, genetic engineering, etc. are all good to know. You don't have to become an expert, but having a firm grasp on the science is extremely useful when evaluating a company's prospects.</p>

<p>If you're interested in becoming an algorithmic trader or a quant, then physics, certain fields of engineering, signals processing, applied math, computer science, or econometrics will get you much farther than a standard finance or accounting degree. Most people can learn the basics of finance; not everyone can learn advanced mathematics.</p>

<p>A lot of the above applies to learning about the forex market as well. Economics is certainly helpful, especially central bank policy, but since the forex market is so massive and liquid, many mathematical tools are necessary because algorithms play a key role as well.</p>

<p>Per littleadv's suggestion, an MBA with a concentration in finance may be an option for someone who already has a degree. Also, an MSF (Master of Science in Finance) or a degree in financial engineering (called an MFE, or ORFE, for Operations Research and Financial Engineering) are other, potentially better options for someone pursuing a more technical career. A high-octane trading firm may not care that you've taken marketing and management classes; they want to hire someone who can understand complex algorithms and design and implement new ones quickly. </p>

<p><a href=""http://rankings.ft.com/businessschoolrankings/masters-in-finance-pre-experience-2012"" rel=""nofollow"">Some MSF programs</a> are pre-experience programs, which means that in exchange for taking more time to complete, they don't expect you to have significant work experience in the financial industry.

"Where does the money go when I buy stocks?","10018","","<p>Let's say I spent 10k and bought some shares of stock A, where does the cash 10k go? Does it go to the stock broker and then the stock broker gives the money to the company of the stock A?</p>
","<p>When you buy a share of stock, you are almost always buying from someone who previously purchased that share and now wants to sell it. The money -- minus broker's fee -- goes to that other investor, which may be a person, a company (rarely the company that issued the stock, but that will occasionally be the case), an investment fund, the ""market maker"" for that stock (websearch for definition of that term), or anyone else. They owned a small percentage of the company; you bought it from them and gave them the money for it, just as you would buy anything else. You don't know or care who you bought from; they don't know or care who they sold to; the market just found a buyer and seller who could agree on the price.</p>

<p>There are a very few exceptions to that. The company may repurchase some of its own shares and/or sell them again, depending on its own financial needs and obligations. For example, my own employer has to purchase its own shares periodically so it has enough on hand to sell to employees at a slight discount  through the Employee Stock Ownership Program. But you generally don't know that's who you're selling to; it happens like any other transaction.</p>

<p>And during the Initial Public Offering, if you're lucky/privileged enough to get in on the first wave of purchases, you're buying from the investment bank that's managing this process ... though that's an almost vanishingly rare case for ""retail"" investors like us; we're more likely to get the shares after someone has already pushed the price up a bit.</p>

<li>If your supervisor says ""no"" you will do one of the following, depending on the results from step 1:

<ul>
<li>If your state requires a pay stub, mention that to your supervisor. He or she should then provide you the pay stub.</li>
<li>If your state does not require a pay stub, you <a href=""http://www.dol.gov/wecanhelp/day_laborers.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">must keep track of the hours yourself</a>. It would then be a good idea to <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/a/45793/26503"">take @jmg229's advice</a> and <a href=""https://www.paycheckcity.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">calculate what your paycheck should be</a> based on the hours you worked, your tax bracket, and other info.</li>
</ul></li>

<p>For us personally, our state <em>does</em> require a pay stub, so my wife should be able to get a pay stub if she asks for it. (""Approach your supervisor"" in step #2 is the hard part, as some introverts may notice.)</p>

"Will our hefty student loans affect our chances of getting a mortgage?","9996","","<p>My husband and I live simply but we're content.  I'm an avid budgeter and love finding ways to be frugal.  My dilemma right now is that we've been able to keep our living expenses below what we make, but I don't know what our focus should be for using the extra.</p>

<p>We've got $100K in student loans (ug), with rates ranging from 3.3% to 9.1%.  We're just making minimum payments right now.  We'd like to buy a house in the next 5 years or so.  We've been saving in a money market account and have $10K there now.</p>

<p>Our credit scores are excellent, but we're afraid that our hefty student loans could hurt us when it comes time to apply for a mortgage.  Does anyone know how our loans will affect a mortgage rate?  And if it does hurt us, how much should we try to pay off before we're safe?</p>

<p>Basically, should we put our focus on paying off our student loans, or saving for a house?</p>
","<p>As for your chances of getting a new home, those student loans if no longer in deferment will count against your DTI, which is your debt to Income.  The bank/credit union gets this number by taking your total monthly payments of all debt on your credit report and dividing this number by your total gross income each month.  The general rule is that this number including your new house payment should be 35% or less.  Paying off these loans will keep this number low, and at the same time show the institution your ability to pay off your loans in full over a longer period of time.  </p>

<p>I would suggest paying down your student loans first.  The amount to pay off changes from person to person and situation to situation.  The best thing for you to do is figure out your own DTI and pay off loans until you get to the 30% mark.  Then I would suggest saving up for a 20% down payment and to put 3 times your monthly income into a savings account for an emergency savings.  </p>

<p>On another note, since mortgage rates are based on your credit score, paying off that amount of school loans will increase your credit score and lower your mortgage rate.</p>

<p>Last, there are many different orders you could pay off your student loans in.  Another suggestion would be to take the student loan with the lowest balance and pay that off regardless of interest rates.  The reason for this is that it creates a ""snowball effect.""  Basically what this means is that when people pay off one loan they get excited and get a renewed interest in paying them down.  If you start with the lowest and work your way up, it gives you momentum and keeps you wanting to pay them down.</p>

  <p>EE Bonds issued after May 2005 earn interest for up to 30 years. They
  earn a fixed rate of interest. For the first 20 years, EE bonds earn
  the same fixed rate that was set when the bond was issued. We may
  change the rate or the way an EE Bond earns interest for the last 10
  years of the bond's 30-year life. If we make a change, we have to do
  it before that 10-year period starts. (This is different from the type

  <p>EE Bonds continue to earn interest for up to 30 years.</p>
  
  <p>Electronic bonds are sold at face value (not half of face value). They
  start to earn interest right away on the full face value. Treasury
  guarantees that for an electronic EE Bond with a June 2003 or later
  issue date, after 20 years, the redemption (cash-in) value will be at
  least twice the purchase price of the bond.  If the redemption
  (cash-in) value is not at least twice the purchase price of the
  electronic bond as a result of applying the fixed rate of interest for
  those 20 years, Treasury will make a one-time adjustment at the 20
  year anniversary of the bond's issue date to make up the difference.</p>

"Why would anyone want to pay off their debts in a way other than ""highest interest"" first?","9962","","<p>Looking at the math, it is clear to many people that, given a number of debts at different interest rates, if you are trying to eliminate your debt, you will pay less interest overall if you pay off the highest interest rate debt first and work your way toward the debt with the lowest interest rate.</p>

<p>However, it is sometimes suggested that people pay off their debts in order from smallest to largest.  What are the advantages to this method?  Why might it be a good idea to do this?</p>

<hr>

<p>Please note: This question is not ""Which method is the best?""  The question is specifically asking for the advantages, if any, to the ""smallest to largest"" method.</p>

<p>Also note: This question is not a duplicate of ""<a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/q/47193/10997"">Is there any reason to NOT pay the minimum on all but one of our loans?</a>""  The ""smallest to largest"" method still chooses only one debt to focus on at a time; that question is asking about paying extra on multiple loans at once.</p>
","<p>It is true that all else being equal, you will pay a lower amount of total interest by paying down your highest interest rate debts first.  However, all else is not always equal.  I'm going to try to come up with some reasons why it might be better in some circumstances to pay your debts in a different order.  And I'll try to use as much math as possible.  :)</p>

<p>Let's say that your goal is to eliminate all of your debt as fast as possible.  The faster you do this, the lower the total interest that you will pay.  Now, let's consider the different methods that you could take to get there: You could pay the highest interest first, you could pay the lowest interest first, or you could pay something in the middle first.  No matter which path you choose, the quicker you pay everything off, the lower total interest you will pay.  In addition to that, the quicker you pay everything off, the difference in total interest paid between the most optimal method and the least optimal method will be less.  To put this in mathematical notation:</p>

<p>lim<sub>t→0</sub> Δ Interest(t) = 0</p>

<p>Given that, anything we can do to speed up the time it takes to get to ""debt free"" is to our advantage.</p>

<p>When paying large amounts of debt as fast as possible, sacrifice is needed.  And this means that psychology comes into play.  I don't know about you, but for me, gamifying the system makes everything easier.  (After all, gamification is what gets us to write answers here on SE.)</p>

<p>One way to do this is to eliminate individual debts as quickly as possible.  For example, let's say that I've got 10 debts.  5 of them are for $1k each.  3 of them are for $5k each, 1 is a $20k car loan, and 1 is a $100k mortgage.  Each one has a monthly payment.</p>

<p>Let's say that I've got $3k sitting in the bank that I want to use to kickstart my debt reduction.  I could pay all $3k toward one of my larger loans, or I could immediately pay off 3 of my 10 loans.  Ignore interest for the moment, and let's say that we are going to pay off the smallest loans first.  When I eliminate these three loans, three of my monthly payments are also gone.  Now let's say that with the money I was paying toward these eliminated debts, and some other money I was able to scrape together $500 a month that I want to use toward debt reduction.  In four months, I've eliminated the last two $1k debts, and I'm down to 5 debts instead of 10.  Achievement Unlocked!</p>

<p>Instead of this strategy, I could have paid toward my largest interest rate.  Let's say that was one of the $5k loans.  I paid the $3k toward the bank to it, and because I still had all the monthly payments after that, I was only able to scrape together $400 a month extra toward debt reduction.  In four months, I still have 10 debts.</p>

<p>Now let's say that after these four months, I have a bad month, and some unexpected expenses come up.  If I've eliminated 5 of my debts, my monthly payments are less, and I'll have an easier month then I would have had if I still had 10 monthly payments to deal with.</p>

<p>Each time I eliminate a debt, the amount extra I have each month to tackle the remaining debts gets bigger.  And if your goal is eliminating debt quickly, these early wins can really help motivate you on.  It really feels like you are getting somewhere when your monthly bills go down.  It also helps you with the debt free mindset.  You start to see a future where you aren't sending payments to the banks each month.  This method of paying your smaller debts first has been popularized in recent years by Dave Ramsey, and he calls it the debt snowball method.</p>

<p>There might be other reasons why you would pick one debt over another to pay first.  For example, let's say that one of your loans is with a bank that has terrible customer service.  They don't send you bills on time, they process your payment late, their website stinks, they are a constant source of stress, and you are getting sick of them.  That would be a great reason to pay that debt first, and never set foot in that bank again.</p>

<hr>

<p>In conclusion:</p>

<p>If you have a constant amount of extra cash each month that you are going to use to reduce your debt, and this will never change, then, yes, you will save money over the long run by paying the highest interest debt first.  However, if you are trying to eliminate your debt as fast as possible, and you are sacrificing in your budget, sending every extra penny you can scrape together toward debt reduction, the ""snowball"" method of knocking out the small debts first can help motivate you to continue to sacrifice toward your goal, and can also ease the cash flow situation in difficult months when you find yourself with less extra to send in.</p>

"Employer doesn't offer a 401(k).  Where can I invest pre-tax dollars?","9949","","<p>My employer doesn't offer a 401k and it doesn't look like they will anytime soon. I already have a maxed out Roth IRA, so I would really like to do something with pre-tax dollars before I push my money into something else. Can I setup my own 401k and invest into that?</p>
","<p>You are already doing everything you can.</p>

<p>If your employer does not have a 401(k) you are limited to investing in a Roth or a traditional IRA (Roth is post tax money, traditional IRA gives you a deduction so it is essentially pre tax money).  The contribution limits are the same for both and contributing to either adds to the limit (so you can't duplicate).</p>

<p><a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2008/01/23/pf/expert/ask_the_expert.moneymag/index.htm"">CNN wrote an article on some other ways to save</a>:</p>

<p>One thing you may want to bring up with your employer is that they could <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEP_IRA"">set up a SEP-IRA</a>.

"Why would a bank need to accept deposits from private clients if it can just borrow from the Federal Reserve?","9839","","<p>As far as I understand, all banks can borrow money from the Central Bank (Federal Reserve in the US) and the rates are (currently) extremely low (or even <em>negative</em> in some cases). If that is so, why would a bank need to accept deposits from private persons? While some banks do charge fees for keeping deposits, there are also plenty of free-of-charge offers out there.</p>

<p>In order not to make this too broad, assume that the bank is in the US.</p>
","<p>They don't actually need to. They accept deposits for historical reasons and because they make money doing so, but there's nothing key to their business that requires them to do so.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/022416/why-banks-dont-need-your-money-make-loans.asp"">Here's a decent summary</a>, but I'll explain in great detail below.</p>

<p>By making loans, banks create money. This is what we mean when we say the
monetary supply is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogenous_money"" title=""endogenous"">endogenous</a>. (At least if you believe Sir Mervyn King, who used to run England's central bank...) The only real checks on this are regulatory--capitalization requirements and reserve requirements, which impose a sort of tax on a bank's circulating loans. I'll get into that later.</p>

<p>Let's start with</p>

<h2>Pragmatics</h2>

<p>Why should you believe that story--that loans create deposits? It seems like a bizarre assertion. But it actually matches how banks behave in practice. If you go borrow money from a bank, the loan officer will do many things. She'll want to look at your credit history. She'll want to look at your income and assets. She'll want to look at what kind of collateral or guarantees you're providing that the loan will be repaid. What she will <strong>not</strong> do is call down to the vaults and make sure that there's enough bills stacked up for them to lend out. Loans are judged based on a profitability function determined by the interest rate and the loan risk. If those add up to ""profitable"", the bank makes the loan. So the limiting factor on the loans a bank makes are the available creditworthy borrowers--not the bank's stock of cash.</p>

<p>Further, the story makes sense because loans are <em>how</em> banks make money. If a bank that was short of money suddenly stopped making loans, it'd be screwed: no new loans = no way to make money to pay back depositors and also keep the lights on = no more bank.</p>

<p>And the story is believable because of the way banks make so little effort to solicit commercial deposit business. Oh sure, they used to give you a free toaster if you opened an account; but now it's really quite challenging to find a no-fee checking account that doesn't impose a super-high deposit limit. And the interest paid on savings deposits is asymptotically approaching zero. If banks actually needed your deposits, they'd be making a lot more of effort to get them. I mean, they won't turn up their noses; your deposited allowance is a couple basis points cheaper to the bank than borrowing from the Fed; but banks seem to value small-potatoes depositors more as a source of fees and sales opportunities for services and consumer credit than as a source of cash. (It's a bit different if you get north of seven figures, but smaller depositors aren't really worth the hassle just for their cash.)</p>

<h2>What about fractional reserves and reserve ratios?</h2>

<p>This is where someone will mention the regulatory requirements of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional-reserve_banking"" title=""fractional reserve banking"">fractional reserve banking</a>: banks are obliged by regulators to keep enough cash on hand to pay out a certain percentage of deposits. Note nothing about loans was said in that statement: this requirement does not serve as a check on the bank making bad loans, because the bank is ultimately liable to all its depositors for the full value of their deposits; it's more making sure they have enough liquidity to prevent <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_run"">bank runs</a>, the self-fulfilling prophecy in which an undercapitalized bank could be forced into bankruptcy. As you noted in your question, banks can always <a href=""http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/072815/why-do-commercial-banks-borrow-federal-reserve.asp"" title=""borrow from the Fed"">borrow from the Fed</a> at the Fed Discount Rate (or from other banks at the interbank overnight rate, which is a little lower) to meet this requirement. They do have to pledge collateral, but <a href=""https://www.frbdiscountwindow.org/RightNavPages/Pledging-Collateral.aspx"">loans themselves are collateral</a>, so this doesn't present much of a problem.</p>

<p>In terms of paying off depositors if the bank should collapse (and minimizing the amount of FDIC insurance payout from the government), it's really <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_requirement"">capital requirements</a> that are actually important. I.E. the bank has to have investors who <em>don't</em> have a right to be paid back and whose investment is on the hook if the bank goes belly-up. But that's just a safeguard for the depositors; it doesn't really have anything to do with loans other than that bad loans are the main reason a bank might go under.</p>

<h2>The Technical Accounting</h2>

<p>Banks, like any other private business, have assets (things of value) and liabilities (obligations to other people). But banking assets and liabilities are counterintuitive. The bank's assets are <em>loans</em>, because they are theoretically recoverable (the principal) and also generate a revenue stream (the interest payments). The money the bank holds in deposits is actually a <em>liability</em>, because it has to pay that money out to depositors on demand, and the deposited money will never (by itself) bring the bank any revenue at all. In fact, it's a drain, because the bank needs to pay interest to its depositors. (Well, they used to anyway.)</p>

<p>So what happens when a bank makes a loan? From a balance sheet perspective, strangely enough, the answer is <em>nothing at all</em>. If I grant you a loan, the minute we shake hands and you sign the paperwork, a teller types on a keyboard and money appears in your account. Your account <em>with my bank</em>. My bank has simultaneously created an asset (the loan you now have to repay me) and an equal-sized liability (the funds I loaned you, which are now deposited in your account). I'll make money on the deal, because the interest you owe me is a much higher rate than the interest I pay on your deposits, or the rate I'd have to pay if I need to borrow cash to cover your withdrawal. (I might just have the cash on hand anyway from interest and origination fees and whatnot from previous loans.)</p>

<p>From an accounting perspective, nothing has happened to my balance sheet, but suddenly you owe me closing costs and a stream of extraneous interest payments. (Nice work if you can get it...)</p>

<h2>So why...?</h2>

<p>Okay, so I've exhaustively demonstrated that I don't need to take deposits to make loans. But we live in a world where banks do! Here's a few reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Historical inertia.</strong> Banks have always taken deposits, it's what the public expects. Also,</li>
<li><strong>It can be profitable</strong>. I can charge you for having too little money in your account, I can charge you exorbitant returned check fees, I can charge you interest on accidental overdrafts... and so on.</li>
<li><strong>It's a sales opportunity</strong> for other products to existing customers. Depositors are often borrowers. If I can sell you a mortgage, or better yet a credit card, I'm way ahead.</li>
<li><strong>It gives me customer information</strong> that might guide my future loaning behavior--if I know your direct deposit, your cash on hand, your monthly expenses, etc., I've got a lot more insight into what you can pay.</li>
<li><strong>Interbank account settling and reconciliation</strong> is a little easier if I have a lot of clients using me for financial services.</li>
<li><strong>Deposits are still cheaper</strong> than borrowing from the Fed, if marginally so. Not worth going out of my way for unless you're a big client who intends to park the money and not move it much, though, otherwise it's too volatile to be meaningfully predictable.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can probably think of more, but at the end of the day, a bank <strong>should</strong> be designed so that if every single (non-borrowing) depositor withdrew their deposits, the bank wouldn't collapse or cease to exist.</p>

","<p>As a contractor, I have done this exact calculation many times so I can compare full time employment offers when they come. The answer varies greatly depending on your situation, but here's how to calculate it:</p>

<ol>
<li>How much is your <strong>annual</strong> healthcare cost if you don't get it from your employer? A good place to start is <a href=""https://www.healthcare.gov/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">healthcare.gov</a> and look up plans that are appropriate for you. If you have expensive health issues, then the calculation is pretty easy because you can count on maxing out your costs, so the calculation is simply monthly premium * 12 + MOOP (max out of pocket). If you are moderately healthy, you may want to keep track of 3 numbers: best case, expected case, and worst case. Example numbers for a family might be $600 * 12 = $7200/yr for best case, perhaps about $9000/yr for the average case if you don't go to the doctor very often, and $7200 + $12,000 MOOP = $19,200/yr for the worst case.</li>
<li>How much is your annual healthcare cost if you get on your employer's plan? Again, this varies by company, your family situation, and which of your employer's plans you choose. Typically though, your premiums will be lower than if you purchased insurance on the exchange, and the deductible and MOOP options are often lower too. For example, suppose a comparable plan to what you would choose on the exchange is $400/month with a $3000 deductible and $5000 MOOP. In this case your best case is $4800/yr, average case might be $6600, and worst case would be $9800.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, subtracting the two and you get</p>

<ul>
<li>Best case: ($7200 vs $4800) you save $2,400</li>
<li>Average case: ($9000 vs $6600) you save $2,400</li>
<li>Worst case: ($19,200 vs $9,800) you save $9,400</li>
</ul>

<p>I've run many different scenarios with multiple plans and employers, and in my situation with a spouse and 1 child, the employer plans usually ended up saving me approximately $5k per year. So then, to answer your question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...salary is ""100k"", ""with healthcare"", or then ""X"" ""with no healthcare"" - what do we reckon?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I reckon I would want to be paid $5K more, or $105K. This is purely hypothetical though and assumes there are no other differences except for with or without health insurance. In reality, contractor vs employee will have quite a few other differences. But in general, the calculation varies by company and the more generous the employer's health benefits, the more you need to be compensated to make up for not having it.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> the above numbers are very rough, and there are <em>many</em> other factors that come into play, some of which are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Depending on your income, a portion of your premiums on the exchange may be subsidized.</li>
<li>Premiums you pay as part of an employer plan are tax deductible, whereas premiums you pay on the exchange may not be.</li>
<li>Your employer may offer an HSA and may even contribute to it (free money).</li>
<li>If you contribute to your HSA through your employer you could reduce your FICA wages by that amount. (Which could save you up to 7% but also might slightly lower your total SS benefit when you retire.)</li>
<li>Can you get insurance another way? In my case I can get pretty inexpensive health insurance through my spouse's plan, so the true value to me of my employer offering insurance is close to $0. In fact, it actually has a negative value since my spouse's plan has a surcharge if I choose to take her insurance while having the option to take my own.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a side note, many years ago, during salary talks with a company, I was able to negotiate $2K in additional yearly salary by agreeing not to take the health insurance since I had better insurance through my spouse. Health insurance in the US was much cheaper back then so I think closer to $5K today would be about right and is consistent with my above ballpark calculation. I always wondered what would have happened if I turned around and enrolled the following year. I suspect had I done that they could not have legally lowered my salary due to my breaking my promise, but I wouldn't be surprised if I didn't get a raise that year either.</p>

"Declare Bankruptcy or Just Wait Seven Years?","9705","","<p>We've got one family member who is the classic definition of ""ne'er–do–well"". I don't think he is capable of understanding money, issues or contracts. When you talk to him he seems to have good intentions but things rarely work out. He owes lots and lots of organizations money.  He also has a gambling problem. We know enough from Gam-anon to never ever give him money, co-sign on any note for him, or even try to intercede to help him on issues involving money.  </p>

<p>I do have a question though. His current plan to get out of debt is to just wait seven years for the debts to dissolve. He told us that the seven year clock starts from the time of his last payment to that organization. So, that's his excuse for not paying off any bills at all, that if he does that, then the seven year clock starts up again.  </p>

Is there any validity to what this kid is saying on his plan to cheat his creditors... and er... get a fresh start on life?</p>

","<p><a href=""https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0117-time-barred-debts"">Time-Barred Debts</a> and <a href=""http://www.bcsalliance.com/debt-statutes-of-limitation-1.html"">STATE STATUTES OF LIMITATION ON COLLECTING DEBTS</a> are good places to start on the issues of what can be collected and for how long. What seems to be at issue is bankruptcy vs. time-barred debts vs. what creditors (original debt owners, not collection agencies or those who buy debt) can do. You should also check out The Fair Credit Reporting Act which governs some of the question. </p>

<p>The Fair Credit Reporting Act and the section on time-barred debts applies to collection agencies, etc. (so-called <em>debt owners</em> as pointed out by @littleadv, since they buy debt from the creditors) not actual <em>creditors</em> (those the debt is/was originally owed to). Creditors (those to whom the debt was originally owed) have different rules than debt collectors and can do things debt collectors can't. State law generally governs what creditors, as original owners of the debt, can do legally and for how long.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Bankruptcy</strong></p>

<p>Bankruptcy is a legal action that frees someone from paying all or part of debt owed (they are crying ""Uncle!"" and stating they don't have enough money to pay their creditors). On a credit report, accounts will generally be updated to show “included in bankruptcy"" or similar. Debt that is determined to still be owed often will be reduced in amount/payments.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Time-barred Debts</strong></p>

<p>Time-barred debts are debts that are still owed, but cannot be collected through direct legal action (suing). Each state has its own statute of limitations on how long different types of debt can be collected by suing after initial default before being considered time-barred. This period is typically 3-6 years but a few states such as Kentucky allow much longer time periods (up to 15 years).</p>

<p>Being a time-barred debt does NOT prevent a collector from contacting someone about a debt. Collectors can still try to collect a debt forever -- and probably will -- but they can't normally sue and collect payment once the statute of limitations period has passed.</p>

<p>There are gotchas with time-barred debts regarding collection, however, which can make them still legally actionable. <strong>Making any payment, no matter how small, making a verbal commitment to pay or even acknowledging the time-barred debt is often enough to make the debt legally collectable, even if it would normally be past the statute of limitations for collection.</strong> This is again state-dependent, but it is a pitfall for many people. The process of making a debt collectable again is often called ""re-aging"". Re-aging essentially means the clock starts anew on the statute of limitations, extending the time that a creditor may use the courts to collect that debt.</p>

<p>If someone is taken to court over a time-barred debt <em>that is legally noncollectable</em> (has not been legally re-aged), nothing happens to them. However, being time-barred does not <em>prevent</em> legal action in the sense that you still have to prove the debt is time-barred and noncollectable in court if your sued over it. </p>

<p><strong><em>Being time-barred does not mean the debt ""dissolves"". A debt is always owed unless the debt has been forgiven or discharged in bankruptcy court.</em></strong> This means that, combined with the ability of debt collectors to contact someone about out of statute debt and the pitfalls of re-aging, it is entirely possible for a debt collector to get a 20 year old debt actionable again.</p>

<p>Also note that while someone is trying to dodge a debt to make it time-barred (e.g. by not paying <em>anything</em>), creditors and debt collectors can still take legal action to sue over the debt, and if they get a judgment against someone, this can extend the debt indefinitely. Judgements will eventually lapse, but often only after 10 years or more, and many states allow dormant judgements to be ""revived"" within that time period.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Credit Reports</strong>   </p>

<p>Regarding credit reports, whether someone owes a debt and whether it appears on a credit report are two separate things. As previously stated, no debt ""dissolves"" or goes away unless some sort of legal action makes it so. </p>

<p>As far as reporting is concerned, however, most ""bad"" credit stops being <em>reported</em> after seven years (by federal law). That is, accounts on a credit report will be deleted seven years from the original delinquency dates of the accounts regardless of being included in bankruptcy or as time-barred debt. This assumes no legal process allows the account to continue being reported (as is often the case with re-aging). As an FYI, a bankruptcy discharge date has <em>nothing</em> to do with when account information will be removed from your credit report. </p>

<p>Note that some debts, such as tax liens, can be reported indefinitely.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Should bankruptcy be considered?</strong></p>

<p>The decision to do bankruptcy is mostly a matter of how severe the debt is. If it is an extremely large amount and assets are very small, bankruptcy is a good route in so far as it will legally take care of a lot of loose ends and likely relieve most or all of the burden of actually owing the money. Credit-wise, 10 years is the maximum a bankruptcy (specifically) will appear on a credit report. Accounts may drop off a credit report before bankruptcy because they are past the seven years they can be legally reported. Debts owed to the state such as child support, student loans, income tax, etc. generally cannot be written off and aren't subject normal debt statute of limitations on collection. </p>

<p>Finally, bad credit is bad credit -- there is likely to be little difference in terms of ability to get loans between bankruptcy and attempting to dodge legal action to make debts time-barred. If the debt is significant, bankruptcy may be the only sensible option.</p>

"Why would anyone buy a government bond?","9686","","<p>In my country, the interest rates on government bonds are currently 2 - 3%, but I have money in a term deposit at the bank which earns 4% interest. I don't understand how this can be possible. Why are there any buyers of government bonds, either individuals or banks? Why couldn't a bank just deposit its money in another bank instead?</p>

<p>As you can tell from my question, I know very little about economics. I would be really grateful if you could answer in the simplest possible language!</p>
","<p>Great question. There are several reasons; I'm going to list the few that I can think of off the top of my head right now.</p>

<p>First, <em>even if</em> institutional bank holdings in such a term account are covered by deposit insurance (this, as well as the amount covered, varies geographically), the amount covered is generally trivial <em>when seen in the context of bank holdings</em>. An individual might have on the order of $1,000 - $10,000 in such an account; for a bank, that's basically chump change, and you are looking more at numbers in the millions of dollars range. Sometimes a lot more than that. For a large bank, even hundreds of millions of dollars might be a relatively small portion of their holdings. <a href=""http://www.goldmansachs.com/investor-relations/financials/current/annual-reports/2011-annual-report-files/GS_AR11_Complete_Fin.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">The 2011 Goldman Sachs annual report</a> (I just pulled a big bank out of thin air, here; no affiliation with them that I know of) states that as of December 2011, their <strong><em>excess</em> liquidity was 171,581 <em>million</em> US dollars</strong> (over 170 billion dollars), with a bottom line total assets of $923,225 million (a shade under <strong>a trillion</strong> dollars) book value. Good luck finding a bank that will pay you 4% interest on even a fraction of such an amount. GS' income before tax in 2011 was a shade under 6.2 billion dollars; 4% on 170 billion dollars is 6.8 billion dollars. That is, the <em>interest payments</em> at such a rate on their excess liquidity alone would have cost more than they themselves made in the entire year, which is completely unsustainable.</p>

<p>Government bonds are as guaranteed as deposit-insurance-covered bank accounts (it'll be the government that steps in and pays the guaranteed amount, quite possibly issuing bonds to cover the cost), but (assuming the country does not default on its debt, which happens from time to time) you will get back the entire amount plus interest. For a deposit-insured bank account of any kind, you are only guaranteed (to the extent that one can guarantee anything) the maximum amount in the country's bank deposit insurance; I believe in most countries, this is at best on the order of $100,000. If the bank where the money is kept goes bankrupt, for holdings on the order of what banks deal with, you would be extremely lucky to recover even a few percent of the principal. Government bonds are also generally accepted as collateral for the bank's own loans, which can make a difference when you need to raise more money in short order because a large customer decided to withdraw a big pile of cash from their account, maybe to buy stocks or bonds themselves.</p>

<p>Government bonds are generally <em>liquid</em>. That is, they aren't just issued by the government, held to maturity while paying interest, and then returned (electronically, these days) in return for their face value in cash. Government bonds are bought and sold on the ""secondary market"" as well, where they are traded in very much the same way as public company stocks.</p>

<p>If banks started simply depositing money with each other, all else aside, then <strong>what would happen?</strong> Keep in mind that the interest rate is basically <em>the price of money</em>. Supply-and-demand would dictate that if you get a huge inflow of capital, you can lower the interest rate paid on that capital. Banks don't pay high interest (and certainly wouldn't do so to each other) because of their intristic good will; they pay high interest <em>because they cannot secure capital funding at lower rates</em>. This is a large reason why the large banks will generally pay much lower interest rates than smaller niche banks; the larger banks are seen as more reliable in the bond market, so are able to get funding more cheaply by issuing bonds.</p>

<p><strong>Individuals</strong> will often buy bonds for the perceived safety. Depending on how much money you are dealing with (sold a large house recently?) it is quite possible even for individuals to hit the ceiling on deposit insurance, and for any of a number of reasons they might not feel comfortable putting the money in the stock market. Buying government bonds then becomes a relatively attractive option -- you get a slightly lower return than you might be able to get in a high-interest savings account, but you are virtually guaranteed return of the entire principal <em>if the bond is held to maturity</em>. On the other hand, it might not be the case that you will get the entire principal back if the bank paying the high interest gets into financial trouble or even bankruptcy. Some people have personal or systemic objections toward banks, limiting their willingness to deposit large amounts of money with them. And of course in some cases, such as for example retirement savings, it might not even be <em>possible</em> to simply stash the money in a savings account, in which case bonds of some kind is your only option if you want a purely interest-bearing investment.</p>

<p>Thanks, Chirag</p>
","<p>It depends on what you mean by ""break even.""  If you're trying to end up where you started financially before you started the process of buying the house then you're asking a lot.  You're essentially asking to get free housing for the 1 1/2 years.</p>

<p>The only ""income"" you have from this process is the additional equity in the house (the principal reduction of your mortgage).  <em>Everything</em> else is an expense:</p>

<ul>
<li>all of the fees you incurred buying the house</li>
<li>all fees that you will incur selling the house (including a 6% commission possibly, plus closing cost concessions to the buyer in the neighborhood of 3%, which are common these days)</li>
<li>all interest, taxes, and insurance</li>
<li>all improvements</li>
<li>all utilities</li>

<p>Add up all of those expenses, and subtract the increase in equity, and that's the difference in your sales prices and your purchase price.  It's a big difference.  You may have been able to pull this off 6-7 years ago, but probably not now.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
My property is fully mortgaged, so basically this agent was trying to double mortgage it to a different bank. </p>
","<p>It depends on how much equity you have in your home.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario 1:</strong> Your home is worth $100K, and your current mortgage is for $100K (or more which means you are underwater.) In this case you can't get a 2nd mortgage because:</p>

<ol>
<li>It's not legal to use the same collateral (e.g. some or all of your house) for multiple loans without all parties knowing about it.</li>
<li>If you let the parties know, then whoever is not first in line to receive the collateral certainly won't agree to it, since the collateral is not yours to use. (The existing mortgage would already have legal claim to it.)</li>
<li>You couldn't do it even if you tried because any real bank will do a title search to discover if you are trying to do this, before giving you any money.</li>
</ol>

<p>That being said, you can use different portions of equity in your home as collateral for multiple mortgages, as long as none of the equity overlaps, but you may need permission from the primary mortgage bank first, for example:</p>

<p><strong>Scenario 2:</strong> Your home is worth $100K, and your current mortgage is for $80K meaning you currently have $20K in equity. It is possible to get a 2nd mortgage or home equity line of credit for $20K.</p>

"Can a person end up in prison for unpaid debt in the USA?","9618","","<p>Many years ago I read in an article <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/12/world/middleeast/12dubai.html?_r=0"">like this one</a> about expats trying to leave the United Arab Emirates quickly whenever their job contract was cancelled. The reasons behind this behavior was that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Large purchases (automobiles and houses) and rentals made in those countries typically involved paying in advance with a stack of post-dated checks, and</li>
<li>Finding the next job was generally not obvious, and</li>
<li>Writing checks that bounced could lead to a prison term</li>
</ul>

<p>Also the prison terms in UAE could often last until the prisoner pays off the debt, and since it's difficult to have an income in prison, this could translate to a very long time period.</p>

<p>On the other hand, judging from <a href=""http://www.expatsblog.com/news/0101135421/bouncing-cheques-in-uae-no-longer-illegal"">this other article</a> it seems that the law has changed in UAE and people no longer get imprisoned for bouncing checks.</p>

<p>Now I read <a href=""http://www.standard.net/Courts/2016/02/14/Man-who-died-in-Box-Elder-jail-was-there-for-not-paying-a-debt"">this article</a> about a person who had ended up in prison in the USA.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On Christmas Eve 2013, the Bear River City man incurred an ambulance
  bill. Tremonton City won a justice court small claims judgment against
  Iverson in September 2014 that compelled him to pay the city
  $2,376.92.</p>
  
  <p>He never paid the bill and ignored repeated court orders to appear,
  court records show. That led to a county sheriff’s deputy, serving a
  $350 bench warrant issued by the justice court on Dec. 29, 2015,
  arresting him on the morning of Saturday, Jan. 23.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had not heard of people being imprisoned in the USA for unpaid debts before. My impression was that unpaid debt is typically sold to collection agencies who then pester the individual until s/he pays the debt.</p>

<p>Like there is this guy who wrote a book about how to make money <a href=""http://amzn.com/B01494Y990"">collecting judgements</a>. In the book he explains that they can be from cases such as when a landlord has taken someone to court for not paying the rent, and the court decrees that the tenant has to pay. The book does not mention that the tenants can end up in prison for failure to pay (if that was the case it would be useful for a collector to know).</p>

<p><strong>So the question I wanted to ask regarding debt in the USA:</strong></p>

<p>What factors can cause a person to end up in prison for a debt? Is it the type of the debt, the amount, the type of the company/organization the debt is owned to, a combination of these or something else?</p>
","<p>In that case, he was not arrested for being unable to pay his bill. He received a summons to court, failed to appear, and so a warrant was issued for his arrest. The $350 was his bail amount, which is funds that must be provided to the court in order to be released while pending trial (you get this money back once you appear before court). He also wasn't convicted of a crime and sentenced to jail in this case, just arrested. He would be ""kept"" by the courts (if he couldn't post bail) until his court date as a way of being forced to appear.</p>

<p>If a judgement was awarded against him, it still doesn't always mean he has to pay. If someone refuses to pay a judgement (but did show up to court) then typically their wages are garnished, which means the court orders that a certain amount of money be withheld from income, tax refunds, etc. until the judgement is paid. However, if the person ordered to pay can prove that they would not be able to have sufficient money to survive if they are garnished (I'm not a lawyer so I am unclear as to the exact process/standards) then there is a chance that nothing will be garnished at all. </p>

<p>So in short, no, there is no such thing as debtor's prison in the USA. There is definitely such a thing as being arrested / put in jail for defying court orders, and I'm sure if you took out loans while knowing you have no ability to repay them that you might be able to be charged with some sort of fraud, but just not being able to pay your bills doesn't mean you can go to jail. Of course, there is very little protecting you from simply running out of money and becoming homeless, but that's not your question.</p>

"Why don't SPY, SPX, and the e-mini s&p 500 track perfectly with each other?","9589","","<p>These tickers (SPY, SPX, /ES) are all based off the S&amp;P 500 yet the relative lows and highs diverge.  Can someone provide a basic explanation what causes this to happen?  I feel like it may stem from my having a basic lack of understanding on what the tickers represent or how they move. I'm aware SPY has dividends (quarterly?) that will jar its price overnight while the others do not.</p>
","<p>I thought the other answers had some good aspect but also some things that might not be completely correct, so I'll take a shot.</p>

<p>As noted by others, there are three different types of entities in your question:  The ETF SPY, the index SPX, and options contracts.</p>

<p>First, let's deal with the options contracts.  You can buy options on the ETF SPY or marked to the index SPX.  Either way, options are about the price of the ETF / index at some <em>future</em> date, so the local min and max of the ""underlying"" symbol generally will not coincide with the min and max of the options.  Of course, the closer the expiration date on the option, the more closely the option price tracks its underlying directly.  Beyond the difference in how they are priced, the options market has different liquidity, and so it may not be able to track quick moves in the underlying. (Although there's a reasonably robust market for option on SPY and SPX specifically.)</p>

<p>Second, let's ask what forces really make SPY and SPX move together as much as they do.  It's one thing to say ""SPY is tied to SPX,"" but how?  There are several answers to this, but I'll argue that the most important factor is that there's a notion of ""authorized participants"" who are players in the market who can ""create"" shares of SPY at will.  They do this by accumulating stock in the constituent companies and turning them into the market maker.  There's also the corresponding notion of ""redemption"" by which an authorized participant will turn in a share of SPY to get stock in the constituent companies. (See <a href=""http://www.spdrsmobile.com/content/how-etfs-are-created-and-redeemed"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.spdrsmobile.com/content/how-etfs-are-created-and-redeemed</a> and <a href=""http://www.etf.com/etf-education-center/7540-what-is-the-etf-creationredemption-mechanism.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.etf.com/etf-education-center/7540-what-is-the-etf-creationredemption-mechanism.html</a>)</p>

<p>Meanwhile, SPX is just computed from the prices of the constituent companies, so it's got no market forces directly on it.  It just reflects what the prices of the companies in the index are doing. (Of course those companies <em>are</em> subject to market forces.)</p>

<p>Key point: <em>Creation / redemption is the real driver for keeping the price aligned.  If it gets too far out of line, then it creates an arbitrage opportunity for an authorized participant.</em>  If the price of SPY gets ""too high"" compared to SPX (and therefore the constituent stocks), an authorized participant can simultaneously sell short SPY shares and buy the constituent companies' stocks.  They can then use the redemption process to close their position at no risk.  And vice versa if SPY gets ""too low.""</p>

<p>Now that we understand why they move together, why don't they move together perfectly.  To some extent information about fees, slight differences in composition between SPY and SPX over time, etc. do play.  The bigger reasons are probably that (a) there are not a lot of authorized participants, (b) there are a relatively large number of companies represented in SPY, so there's some actual cost and risk involved in trying to quickly buy/sell the full set to capture the theoretical arbitrage that I described, and (c) redemption / creation units only come in pretty big blocks, which complicates the issues under point b.</p>

<p>You asked about dividends, so let me comment briefly on that too.  The dividend on SPY is (more or less) passing on the dividends from the constituent companies. (I think - not completely sure - that the market maker deducts its fees from this cash, so it's not a direct pass through.)  But each company pays on its own schedule and SPY does not make a payment every time, so it's holding a corresponding amount of cash between its dividend payments.  This is factored into the price through the creation / redemption process.  I don't know how big of a factor it is though.</p>

"Tax implications of restricted stock units","9521","","<p>Last May I had been with my company for a year so I got the first grant of restricted stock units (RSUs) that vest over 4 years. Based on this answer to a <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/7647/what-is-my-next-step-with-investing-given-a-signing-bonus-of-restricted-stock-u/7660#7660"">related question</a>, I am thinking I should have sold them immediately. But now I have kept them for over half a year and the stock price has increased. As I understand, the RSUs are taxed as regular income, and my cost basis for the remaining shares (after some were sold to cover tax withholding) is their value at the time of the grant.</p>

<p>So although I'd like to sell them, at this point wouldn't I be better off holding on to them for a year so I get the long-term capital gains tax rate rather than short-term? However, after I have had the stock for a year I will get another grant of RSUs. How does the capital gains tax work when you have some shares that were just just granted and others that you have had for a year? Did I shoot myself in the foot by not selling immediately?</p>

<p>FOLLOW-UP: I am also thinking about participating in an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) which offers a 15% discount, and selling those shares immediately as well. But I think I might have the same issue with newly acquired stock being grouped together with stock held for several months or longer that has gone up in value. How does this work with regard to short- or long-term capital gains taxes?</p>
","<p>RSU are taxed when vested, based on their value at that point, as salary. If you don't sell to cover, you need to pay the taxes, if you sell to cover - you sell the portion that is worth the taxes (brokers do that automatically, and remit the taxes on your behalf).</p>

<p>Once paid your taxes, it becomes a regular stock position - short term gains if you sell within a year after vesting, long term if you wait for more than a year. The consideration whether to wait or sell is as with any other investment, them being previously restricted has no meaning. You calculate the gain for each position, so the fact that you have more than one position is not a problem.</p>

<p>The RSU income and the taxes paid will appear on your W2, so when the broker reports proceeds, you can show the basis and thus calculate the gain.

"What are the downsides that prevent more people from working in high-income countries, and then retiring in low-income (and cost of living) ones?","9499","","<p>Having experienced living in several different countries, the reality of different salary ranges and different costs of living has struck me.</p>

<p>You can work at a high salary country and make huge amounts of money compared to what you would make in a third world country with the same skill set and same job description. </p>

<p>Then you can retire at a country with a low cost of living, and get 2-4x your money's worth vs if you'd spent it back in a country with a high cost of living.</p>

<p>What disadvantages am I missing?</p>

<p>Of course, family, relationships, or property comes to mind. And I do think those reasons are enough for you to stay in a country with a high cost of living. </p>

<p>I was just wondering if, aside from that, am I missing anything else?</p>
","<p>There are two parts to the hack you describe.  One is moving to a high-cost, high-pay country to work, and the other is moving to a low-cost, low-pay country to retire.</p>

<p>As Dilip mentioned in a comment, the first part is not so easy in many cases.  You can't just take a plane to the USA and start making big bucks immediately.  In the first place, it's illegal to work without special visa permissions.  Even if you manage to secure that permission (or take the risk of trying to work illegally), there's no guarantee you'll get a job, let alone a high-paying one.  The same is true in most other high-paying countries.</p>

<p>As for the second part, that takes considerable willpower as well.  After spending X years getting used to a country, investing time and money, you must then have the resolve to uproot your life a second time and move to another country.  For the most part, countries are expensive for a reason.  Even if you in principle reject the cost-benefit tradeoffs of a particular country, it can be difficult to give up some of those benefits when the time comes (e.g., trains running on time, reliable electricity, donut shops, or whatever).  You might ""get soft"" or become co-opted by the rich-country rat race and find it difficult to extricate yourself.</p>

<p>All of these problems are compounded if, as in many cases, you happened to start a family while in the expensive country.  At the least, moving would require uprooting not just you but your family.  Also, quality of education is often one of the main reasons people immigrate permanently to expensive countries.  Even a person who personally would prefer to retire to a cheaper country may be unwilling to transplant their children into that country's education system.  (Of course, they could wait until the children are self-supporting, but that makes the wait longer, and may result in them living far away from their children, which they may not want.)</p>

<p>As JoeTaxpayer notes, the same reasons may work on smaller levels, even within a country.  In theory it's perfectly possible to power through a brief, lucrative career in Silicon Valley and then retire to Idaho, but it doesn't seem to happen as often as the plain numbers might suggest.  A simple way to put it might be that the kind of person who would be happy living in a cheap environment often cannot or will not endure a lengthy ""tour of duty"" in an expensive environment.  Either you like the expensive environment and stay, or you leave, not as a planned lifehack, but because you realize you don't like it.</p>

"Is it possible to make money by getting a mortgage?","9481","","<p>I met with a financial advisor for the first time yesterday (trying to get my things in order for retirement).  During our meeting he told me a story that sounded pretty impressive, but the more I think about it, the more I don't understand how it would work.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have a rich client who is retired.  He was paying a fortune in
  taxes.  I  advised him to take out a mortgage on his already paid off
  house.  Thanks to  the deductions the house gave him, he actually paid
  <em>less</em> on the mortgage and  his taxes than he was before.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(This is all in the US, by the way.)</p>

<p>He went into more detail about how it was tricky to get the mortgage and it all sounded very creative.  But my very limited understanding is that this is impossible.  The deductions you get from the interest on your mortgage will reduce your taxable income, but it's only going to reduce your tax burden by something like 30% (optimistically).  </p>

<p>If I reduce my taxable income by $1, and I'm paying 30% in taxes, I've saved .30 off my taxes, but I still have .70 less than I would have if I just did nothing.  At least, that's how I understand it.</p>

<p>Now, I get that it's different if you are comparing renting a house verse buying a house - because things like the value of the home become a factor.  If the house appreciates or depreciates it changes the numbers drastically - but in this story, the guy already owned the same house, so it has no impact.</p>

<p>This guy is a professional and had a bunch of certifications and what not on his desk....but it just sounds completely wrong to me.  Can someone explain what I'm missing?</p>
","<p>To keep the math simple, say you are in the 25% federal tax bracket. Your 4% mortgage effectively costs you 3%. Did Mr Advisor tell you what he suggests investing the money in? Borrowing at 3% net to put the money in .1% CDs makes little sense. And for most people, investing it in the stock market hoping to come out ahead, also makes little sense. </p>

<p>Credentials or not, people like him give humans a bad name, and make me love my dog even more. I'd stay far away from this guy. Very far away. </p>

<p>Edit - on further reflection (seeing mhoran's reference to $100K) it occurred to me that once a house is paid off, the only deductions allowed is for the first $100K of new mortgage or HELOC, absent a renovation or improvement of some kind. Given the limit and current 4% rates, it would seem to me that a rich retiree paying a <em>fortune</em> in taxes, isn't going to benefit much for a $4000 deduction. </p>

<p>The reason I am confused is if I put something on the card very soon after I receive the statement, say the next day, it actually won't appear until the following statement, and won't be paid off until 30+ days after I made the purchase.</p>

<p>I was surprised that almost all cars advertised as being in good condition were actually worth much less than that, and almost half of them were suspected to have the odometer rewound. We tried to negotiate the price for some but the sellers were always firm. We ended up buying one in a dealership with warranty within the same price and mileage range. Why are people selling cars on Craigslist for so much above the KBB prices, more than they're worth? Are sellers expecting to be negotiated for a lower price more aggressively?</p>

<p>Apparently they are able to get those prices.  If they weren't, they'd compromise eventually.  Look for older advertisements where people may be feeling more desperate.  If you can't find them, then that means that the car is selling.  They're right about the prices; Kelley Blue Book (KBB) is wrong.  </p>

<p>It's interesting that the dealership hasn't caught up yet.  If the used car market on Craigslist is robust, it should carry over eventually.  I would expect dealership prices to be noticeably higher on average.  The warranty if nothing else.  </p>

<p>Perhaps Craigslist has too good a reputation.  People are buying there even though they'd be better off with a dealer.  Easy enough to fix.  Go to a dealer and offer to sell cars for them (for commission).  Advertise on Craigslist.  Buyers should prefer warrantied cars over non-warrantied cars at the same price.  With cars selling like hot cakes, the dealer will increase prices.  KBB will adjust their numbers.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Auction wasn't a good option since we needed the car quickly and quality there varies and we don't really know how to deal in auctions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wouldn't recommend buying a car at auction unless you plan to buy a lot of cars.  The quality is all over the place.  You can get a great deal, but you are just as likely to get a lemon.  If you buy a lot of cars, it will even out over time.  But if you just need one, you can get royally screwed.  </p>

<p>Auctions are designed for buyers who are constantly processing cars.  If one is a lemon, they can make it up on the next one.  The low prices at auction are a sort of reverse insurance.  They charge less because they can't guarantee quality.  So let the dealers buy at auction and fix up the cars with a warranty.  Because they do it often, it works out in the long run for them.  For an individual buying one car, I wouldn't recommend it.  Too much risk with too few options for mitigation.  </p>

<p>I realize this is just reinforcing what you already thought.  I just don't want other people to start diving into auctions without understanding how they work.  Yes, cars can be cheaper there.  But the reason is that auctions sell anything, including cars that the seller is dumping <em>because</em> they are lemons.  In bulk, the risk is manageable.  Individually, it isn't.  You may get lucky, or you may get a turkey that costs you more than it benefits you.  </p>

"why is the money withdrawn from traditional IRA taxed at the ordinary income tax rate?","9427","","<p>When  money is withdrawn from a traditional IRA account, why is the money taxed at the rate same as for ordinary income, instead of capital gain tax rate? In other words, what is the rationale for it?</p>

<p>Is the tax rate for ordinary income higher or lower than the tax rate on (long term and short term) capital gain? </p>

<p>Thanks and regards!</p>
","<p>You are missing something very significant.</p>

<p>The money in a traditional IRA (specifically, a deductible traditional IRA; there is not really any reason to keep a nondeductible traditional IRA anymore) is <em>pre-tax</em>. That means when you pay tax on it when you take it out, you are paying tax on it <em>for the first time</em>.</p>

<p>If you take ordinary money to invest it in stocks, and then pay capital gains tax on it when you take it out, that is <em>post-tax</em> money to begin with -- meaning that you have already paid (income) tax on it once. Then you have to pay tax <em>again</em> on the time-value growth of that money (i.e. that growth is earned <em>from</em> money that is already taxed). That means you are effectively paying tax twice on part of that money.</p>

<p>If that doesn't make sense to you, and you think that interest, capital gains, etc. is the first time you're paying tax on the money because it's growth, then you have a very simplistic view of money. There's something called time value of money, which means that a certain amount of money is <em>equivalent</em> to a greater amount of money in the future. If you invest $100 now and end up with $150 in the future, that $150 in the future is effectively the <em>same money</em> as the $100 now.</p>

<p>Let's consider a few examples. Let's say you have $1000 of pre-tax income you want to invest and withdraw a certain period of time later in retirement. Let's say you have an investment that grows 100% over this period of time. And let's say that your tax rate now and in the future is 25% (and for simplicity, assume that all income is taxed at that rate instead of the tax bracket system). And capital gains tax is 15%.</p>

<ul>
<li>Put it in a Traditional IRA and withdraw it: $1000 grows to $2000, you pay 25% taxes, end up with $1500</li>
<li>Take it in your paycheck, and then invest it in the stock, and withdraw it at the end: $1000, you pay 25% income tax to $750, the investment grows to $1500, but then you pay capital gains tax of 15% x $750 = $112.50. You end up with $1387.50</li>
<li>Put it in a Roth IRA and withdraw it: $1000, you pay 25% income tax on it to $750; it then grows to $1500; you pay no taxes on that</li>
</ul>

<p>You see a few things: Traditional IRA and Roth IRA are equivalent if the tax rates are the same. This is because, in both cases, you pay tax <em>one time</em> on the money (the only difference between paying tax now and later is the tax rate). It doesn't matter that you're paying tax only on the principal for the Roth and on the principal plus earnings for Traditional, because the principal now is <em>equivalent</em> to the principal plus earnings in the future.</p>

<p>And you also see that investing money outside fares worse than both of them. That is because you are paying tax on the money once <em>plus</em> some more. When you compare it against the Roth IRA, the disadvantage is obvious -- in both cases you pay income tax on the principal, but for Roth IRA you pay nothing on the earnings, whereas for the outside stock, you pay some tax on the earnings. What may be less obvious is it is equally disadvantageous compared to a Traditional IRA; Traditional and Roth IRA are equivalent in this comparison.</p>

<p>401(k)s and IRAs have a fundamental tax benefit compared to normal money investment, because they allow money to be taxed <em>only one time</em>. No matter how low the capital gains tax rate it, it is still worse because it is a tax on time-value growth from money that is already taxed.</p>

"Can I take out a loan and invest it at higher interest?","9423","","<p>I noticed today that my bank is offering small loans of up to £15000 at 3.3% interest. Meanwhile, services like Zopa and RateSetter are offering over 6% interest on investments in their platforms.</p>

<p>I feel like there must be some catch here, but what is it? What's to stop me from taking out a loan from the bank, investing it at higher interest and pocketing the difference (presuming I am able to make the monthly loan repayments myself in the meantime)?</p>
","<p><strong>You must consider the different levels of risk associated with each loan.</strong></p>

<p>When the bank loans you money, it does so based on a high degree of information about your financial situation (through your credit report + additional information gathered at the time of granting your request). It feels quite confident that you will repay them, and therefore considers you to be low risk. In order to make a profit off of all its low risk clients, the bank only needs to charge a small rate of interest - competitive with the market but enough to cover the losses from clients who will default.</p>

<p>When you loan money through a peer-to-peer program, you are at two distinct disadvantages from the bank:</p>

<p>(1) <strong>Your loan portfolio will not be diversified</strong>; that is, you may have only a single person or a small handful of people owing you money. Any catastrophic event in their lives may wipe out their loan to you. Whereas the bank can play the averages with a broader client base.</p>

<p>(2) <strong>You have less information, and ultimately less (effective) power to reclaim your losses</strong>. Would you feel confident walking behind the desk at a bank today, and deciding whether to approve someone's loan based on the information that the bank's back-end has already determined is necessary to make that decision? Now how about when you are doing it on your own?</p>

<p><strong>Because of this, you take on more risk from a peer-to-peer loan than a bank takes on from you</strong>. That's why the person is willing (or, required due to market availability) to pay a higher rate; they know they are higher risk. That doesn't mean this is a bad idea, just that there is a specific reason that the difference in rates exists, and it implies that you should consider carefully whether the risks outweigh the benefits.</p>

<p>Note that the concept of taking a buy/sell position on two theoretically identical assets while earning a net profit at no risk is known as 'arbitrage'. Arbitrage situations rarely exist, and never for long. Whenever you see a position that appears to be arbitrage, consider what might make it not so. ie: you could buy inventory in location A, and sell it at 10% higher margin in location B - but have you considered transportation, carrying costs, and interest for the period that you physically held the inventory?</p>

<p>The appearance of arbitrage may (in my opinion) be a sign that you have incomplete information.</p>

As far as endorsement, you should write ""For deposit only"" and sign your name underneath in the area of the back of the check for endorsements.  This will ensure that the check is deposited into your account and cannot be cashed if it is intercepted in the mail.</p>

","<p>The credit card may have advantages in at least two cases:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In some instances (at least in the US), a merchant will put a ""hold"" on a credit card without charging it.  This happens a lot at hotels, for example, which use the hold as collateral against damages and incidental charges.  On a credit card this temporarily reduces your credit limit but never appears on your bill.  I've never tried to do it on a debit card, but my understanding is that they either reject the debit card for this purpose or they <em>actually make the withdrawal</em> and then issue a refund later.  You'll actually need to account for this in your cash flow on the debit card but not on the credit card.</p></li>
<li><p>If you get a fraudulent charge on your credit card, it impacts that account until you detect it and go through the fraud resolution process.  On a debit card, the fraudulent charge may ripple through the rest of your life.  The rent payment that you made by electronic transfer or (in the US) by check, for example, is now rejected because your bank account is short by the amount of the fraud even if you didn't use the debit card to pay it.  Eventually this will probably get sorted out, but it has potential to create a bigger mess than is necessary.</p></li>

","<p>You can make the rollover at a later time without a problem.   If you are rolling from a 401k to a Roth IRA, the timing will affect your taxes.   If you are rolling from a 401k to a Traditional IRA, also called a Rollover IRA in this case, you can do it at any time.</p>

I found out some additional information recently that I wasn't aware of.
Apparently you once the money is in a Rollover IRA, it can be converted into a Roth IRA at any later point without incurring a distribution penalty (of course, you still have to pay that taxes at the point of conversion).
There is no time limit for the conversion either.</p>

"How do top investors pull out 20% ROI?","9363","","<p>
I've been searching the ROI percentage of well known investors.
<ul>
    <li>Warren Buffet - (Berkshire Hathaway) 22% annual return from 1964-2005</li>
    <li>George Soros - (Soros Fund Management) 30% annual return between 1970-2000</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
I was wondering how can they manage to pull this off despite the fact that the average company they invest in does not even come close to a 15% annualized return.  
</p>

<p>
What kind of sorcery are they using, leverage, preferred stocks?<br />
Is it something that I am missing?
</p>
","<p>First of all, the annual returns are an average, there are probably some years where their return was several thousand percent,  this can make a decade of 2% a year become an average of 20% .</p>

<p>Second of all, accredited investors are allowed to do many things that the majority of the population cannot do. Although this is mostly tied to net worth, less than 3% of the US population is registered as accredited investors. Accredited Investors are allowed to participate in private offerings of securities that do not have to be registered with the SEC, although theoretically riskier, these can have greater returns. Indeed a lot of companies that go public these days only do so after the majority of the growth potential is done. For example, a company like Facebook in the 90s would have gone public when it was a million dollar company, instead Facebook went public when it was already a 100 billion dollar company. The people that were privileged enough to be ALLOWED to invest in Facebook while it was private, experienced 10000% returns, public stock market investors from Facebook's IPO have experienced a nearly 100% return, in comparison.</p>

<p>Third, there are even more rules that are simply different between the ""underclass"" and the ""upperclass"". Especially when it comes to leverage, the rules on margin in the stock market and options markets are simply different between classes of investors. The more capital you have, the less you actually have to use to open a trade. Imagine a situation where a retail investor can invest in a stock by only putting down 25% of the value of the stock's shares. Someone with the net worth of an accredited investor could put down 5% of the value of the shares. So if the stock goes up, the person that already has money would earn a greater percentage than the peon thats actually investing to earn money at all.</p>

<p>Fourth, Warren Buffett's fund and George Soros' funds aren't just in stocks. George Soros' claim to fame was taking big bets in the foreign exchange market. The leverage in that market is much greater than one can experience in the stock market.</p>

<p>Fifth, Options. Anyone can open an options contract, but getting someone else to be on the other side of it is harder. Someone with clout can negotiate a 10 year options contract for pretty cheap and gain greatly if their stock or other asset appreciates in value much greater. There are cultural limitations that prompt some people to make a distinction between investing and gambling, but others are not bound by those limitations and can take any kind of bet they like.</p>

"Tax implications of selling part of land associated with main home","9359","","<p>My wife and I are considering splitting off a portion of the land attached to our main residence.  Will this be taxed as a capital gain?  Can the money be put towards the mortgage and not be taxed?  Can the profit from the sale be excluded from capital gains?</p>
","<p>I'm going to answer this question for US taxpayers.</p>

<p>It depends whether you sell your primary residence within 2 years of selling the vacant land next to your home.  If you do not, then this is just a sale of land at the capital gains rate.  If you do sell your residence, then you may be able to exclude the land sale as part of the same sale (even if it was to multiple buyers).</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p523.pdf""><strong>Pub 523, Selling Your Home</strong></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Vacant land.</strong>   The sale of vacant land is not a sale of your main home unless:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>The vacant land is adjacent to land containing your home,</p></li>
  <li><p>You owned and used the vacant land as part of your main home,</p></li>
  <li><p>The separate sale of your home satisfies the requirements for exclusion and occurs within 2 years before or 2 years after the date of the sale of the vacant land, and</p></li>
  <li><p>The other requirements for excluding gain from the sale of a main home have been satisfied with respect to the vacant land.</p></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>If these requirements are met, the sale of the home and the sale of the vacant land are treated as one sale and only one maximum exclusion can be applied to any gain. See Excluding the Gain , later.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Without the primary residence exclusion, the sale of real property will generally be capital gain.</p>

<p>There are ways to avoid capital gain, such as swapping it for another piece of land (a §1031 like-kind exchange or a Starker exchange) - though the cash ""boot"" that changes hands will generally be taxable to recipient and go into the basis of the payor.  I'm not familiar with a way to shield sale proceeds from tax by paying your mortgage (except to the extent that mortgage interest is already deductible).</p>

<p>Don't forget to reduce your gains by your cost basis.  You only pay tax on the gain, not the whole sale price.  And as you allocate your basis between the land the home, remember that allocations to basis of one come at the expense of basis for the other (if you spent $500 buying two items, then allocating $50 to one means you've allocated no more than $450 to the other).</p>

<p>Speaking purely hypothetically, a person who purchased land and a home together with a single price could decide an allocation of basis that nearly eliminated gain on the sale of a parcel.  Then whenever the home finally sold, the primary residence gain exclusion would wipe out $250k ($500k married) of the gain, so the basis is less valuable when allocated to the home.  Of course, the IRS is fully aware of this issue and there would have to be some reasonable basis for allocating the basis in such a way (and no clear documentation showing a different allocation).  </p>

<p>1) newly opened accounts is a bad signal for FICO (damn it!)</p>

<p>2) average age of all accounts dropped </p>

<p>So : if I cancel Discover and Priceline, this should take care of the above two issues, shouldn't it ? I want to get back to my 725 score, or at least to > 700. Will cancelling these new cards help ? </p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","<p>New accounts cause a dip in your FICO score. New credit pulls cause a dip in your FICO score. Applying for a new credit cards triggers a credit pull and a new account report (if approved) - double depth dip. Applying for two of those - double depth double depth dip.</p>

<p>Cancelling an account doesn't trigger any change to your score on its own, the account will remain on the report for many more years. What does cause a dip is a hike in the debt/credit ratio. So cancelling the newly opened accounts will not ""reverse"" the double depth double depth dip you've just caused. It will, however, have a potential to add another dip if opening your accounts improved significantly the debt to credit ratio.</p>

<p>You need to be careful with what accounts you open or close, but you shouldn't be concerned too much about FICO score in that regard. These dips will go away after a few months and your credit score will get back to where it was.</p>

"After consulting HR Block, are you actually obligated to file your taxes with them, if they've found ways to save you money?","9342","","<h3>tl;dr</h3>

<p>HR Block charged me $100 for a ""review""—that is, entering in their system what I myself calculated my returns would be (via TurboTax), and seeing what they could come up with to beat that. If they were able to save me money (after deducing their fees, to my advantage), they said I was obligated to file my taxes with them.</p>

<p>Am I actually obligated? Or is it more an obligation out of courtesy?</p>

<hr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>I'd done my own taxes on TurboTax for years, but this year, relocating from New York to California and working form home (for the same company), I knew my taxes were gonna be a little more complicated. For example I'd always taken standard deductions, and this year I'd have to itemize my deductions to expense Home Office costs.</p>

<p>I used TurboTax as usual, but was disappointed to see that I owed New York State nearly $3,000. I didn't outright reject this figure. How should I know? I'd filed taxes only a handful of times in my life, all in New York State. Plus, I <em>live</em> in California, but I still <em>work</em> for the same company in New York—and in New York City, nonetheless. Maybe I'm obligated to pay taxes in <em>all</em> these jurisdictions. Maybe it's just the cost of being a part-year resident between NYC and another state, and next year will be better. I had no clue.</p>

<p>Still, it seemed imprudent to accept without checking with someone, so I sought a tax professional. This late in the game though, no CPAs were taking clients. (Yes, absolutely my fault, but having never hired a tax professional before, I didn't realize there was such a crunch! I thought there'd always be hands as long as there was work.) Only HR Block was willing to schedule a consultation.</p>

<p>So, as already summarized at top, HR Block was going to charge me $100 for a ""review,"" where they'd see whether they could do any better. And if they <em>could</em>, they stated that I was obligated to file my taxes with them. Regardless the obligation, paying $100 to gain knowledge (and possibly a positive return) seemed more than worth it, so I scheduled a consultation.</p>

<p>Within the first 5 minutes of that consultation, the tax professional immediately noted that my employer made a mistake on my W-2, listing my <em>entire</em> income as New York State income, instead of only the portion earned while I was a resident of New York State. (Hey, I didn't know—I thought maybe since I still worked for a company in New York, that's just how things were done. I never thought to question the very figures printed on my W-2.)</p>

<p>Other than correcting that mistake, a single numeric figure, it seemed everything else was entered exactly as I had on TurboTax. Later, in fact, I logged into TurboTax again and corrected just that one field: I found that I would have received even <em>higher</em> returns than HR Block filed for, because I'd been more meticulous about my itemized deductions at home.</p>

<p>Anyway, I was happy. Instead of owing New York State nearly $3,000, New York State owed <em>me</em> nearly $500. What a difference!</p>

<p>It's too late for me now—I already filed with HR Block. But I still wonder—could I have walked out in the first 5 minutes? (The thing is, even if I wasn't <em>legally</em> bound, I would have felt like an indecent human being to leave after finding out that critical piece of information. But are tax professionals used to that sort of thing?)</p>
","<p>The obligation is contractual, so you need to read the contract to answer your question.</p>

<p>However, since you paid for the service provided, I see no way they can <em>force</em> you buy any other service from them. They cannot file your tax returns without your explicit consent (on a form dedicated to that, dated and having the numbers matching the return filed - not something you can sign before the actual return is ready). Worst case they can claim you owe them more money, but since you paid for the services provided, I can't see how they can have that stand in court as well.</p>

<p>Bottom line - even if the contract has such an obligation, I cannot see how it can be enforced.</p>

<p>As to the mistake they noted... I wouldn't rely on H&amp;R Block advice in any matter. Very likely, the person you were talking to was not even licensed to provide tax advice. You're lucky if the person has passed CRTP exams (in California they're legally required), but I seriously doubt their clerks are EAs or CPAs (the only designations other than a lawyer legally allowed to provide tax advice).</p>

<p>Tax preparers (CRTPs included) are only allowed to provide advice pertaining to the preparation of the tax return they're currently engaged to prepare. Claiming income is sourced or not sourced in NY is borderline, IMHO. If they got it wrong (and to me it sounds as they did) you can sue them for damages.</p>

<p>If your situation is tricky and it is too late to get an appointment with a proper adviser - file an extension (<a href=""http://www.irs.gov/uac/Form-4868,-Application-for-Automatic-Extension-of-Time-To-File-U.S.-Individual-Income-Tax-Return"">form 4868</a>) and deal with it after the April busy season.</p>

"What is the equation for an inflation adjusted annuity held in perpetuity?","9338","","<p>What is the equation relating an initial investment, a fixed rate of return, an inflation rate, and a perpetual payment adjusted for that inflation rate?</p>
","<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> After reading one of the comments on the original question, I realized that there is a much more intuitive way to think about this. If you look at it as a standard PV calculation and hold each of the cashflows constant. Really what's happening is that because of inflation the discount rate isn't the full value of the interest rate. Really the discount rate is only the portion of the interest rate above the inflation rate. Hence in the standard perpetuity PV equation <code>PV = A / r</code> r becomes the interest rate less the inflation rate which gives you <code>PV = A / (i - g)</code>.</p>

<p>That seems like a much better way to get to the answer than all the machinations I was originally trying.</p>

<hr>

<p>Original Answer:</p>

<p>I think I finally figured this out. The general term for this type of system in which the payments increase over time is a gradient series annuity. In this specific example since the payment is increasing by a percentage each period (not a constant rate) this would be considered a geometric gradient series.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""https://eng.ucmerced.edu/people/rbales/Courses/ENGR155files/Week03/Week03_1"" rel=""nofollow"">this link</a> the formula for the present value of a geometric gradient series of payments is:</p>

<pre><code>P = A_1 [1 - (1 + g)^n(1 + i)^-n]/(i - g)
</code></pre>

<p>Where</p>

<p><code>P</code> is the present value of this series of cashflows.
  <code>A_1</code> is the initial payment for period 1 (i.e. the amount you want to withdraw adjusted for inflation).
  <code>g</code> is the gradient or growth rate of the periodic payment (in this case this is the inflation rate)
  <code>i</code> is the interest rate
  <code>n</code> is the number of payments</p>

<p>This is almost exactly what I was looking for in my original question. The only problem is this is for a fixed amount of time (i.e. n periods). In order to figure out the formula for a perpetuity we need to find the limit of the right side of this equation as the number of periods (n) approaches infinity.</p>

<p>Luckily in this equation n is already well isolated to a single term: <code>(1 + g)^n/(1 + i)^-n}</code>. And since we know that the interest rate, i, has to be greater than the inflation rate, g, the limit of that factor is 0.</p>

<p>So after replacing that term with 0 our equation simplifies to the following:</p>

<pre><code>P = A_1 / (i - g)
</code></pre>

<p>Note: I don't do this stuff for a living and honestly don't have a fantastic finance IQ. It's been a while since I've done any calculus or even this much algebra so I may have made an error in the math.</p>

  <p>A trader when buying needs to buy at the ask price and when selling needs to sell
  at the bid price. So how can a trade happen 'in between' the bid and ask?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Saying the <em>trade</em> can happen ""in between"" the bid &amp; ask is simplistic.  There is a time dimension to the market.  It's more accurate to say that an <em>order</em> can be placed ""in between"" the current best bid &amp; ask (observed at time T=0), thus establishing a new level for one or the other of those quoted prices (observed at time T>0).</p>

<p>If you enter a <em>market</em> order to buy (or sell), then yes, you'll generally be accepting the <strong>current</strong> best ask (or best bid) with your order, because that's what a market order says to do: Accept the current best market price being offered for your kind of transaction.  Of course, prices may move much faster than your observation of the price and the time it takes to process your order &ndash; you're far from being the only participant.</p>

<p>Market orders aside, <strong>you are free to name your own price</strong> above or below the current best bid &amp; ask, respectively.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you were to enter an order to <em>sell</em> at a price that is <em>lower</em> than the current best ask, or,</li>
<li>If you were to enter an order to <em>buy</em> at a price that is <em>higher</em> than the current best bid,</li>
</ul>

<p>... then one could say that you are placing an order ""in between"" the bid and ask <em>at the time your order is placed</em>.  However &ndash; and this is key &ndash; you are also <em>moving</em> one or the other of those quoted prices in the process of placing your above-bid buy order or your below-ask sell order.</p>

<p>Then, only if <em>somebody else</em> in the market chooses to accept your new ask (or bid) does your intended transaction take place. And <em>that</em> transaction takes place at the <em>new</em> ask (or bid) price, not the old one that was current when you entered your order.</p>

"Why should we expect stocks to go up in the long term?","9331","","<p>I have read in many personal finance books that stocks are a great investment for the long term, because on average they go up 5-7% every year. This has been true for the last 100 years for the S&amp;P500 index, but is there reason to believe this trend will continue indefinitely into the future?</p>

<p>Look at other markets. The <a href=""https://www.google.com/finance?q=SHA:000001"" rel=""noreferrer"">Shanghai stock index</a> trades much lower today than the same day 10 years ago, and the <a href=""https://www.google.com/finance?q=INDEXNIKKEI:NI225"" rel=""noreferrer"">Japanese stock index</a> has not grown for the last 20 years. Is the standard assumption of 5-7% growth true only for American stocks?</p>

<p>Can we expect the trend for the S&amp;P500 to continue? The last 100 years have been a period of economic prosperity for the US, so it's no surprise that stocks have done so well, but is economic prosperity required for such stock growth?</p>
","<p><strong>Does it make sense for stocks to earn a premium indefinitely?</strong></p>

<p>Yes. There is good reason to think that the stock market will make money indefinitely: the <em>stock market is the primary mechanism through which investors bear market risk, which requires compensation</em>.  If you think of all the owners of firms (stockholders and bondholders, generally) the risk premium that stocks earn stocks is the way bondholders pay equityholders to bear the risk that they do not wish to.</p>

<p><strong>Will stock prices always go up in the long run?</strong></p>

<p>As long as companies pay out less in dividends than their profit, prices will go up.  That could change if we were to change our corporate culture and/or tax practices so that firms paid out more in dividends.  However, for the purposes of your question, I think it doesn't matter much whether the investor makes money as dividends or capital gains.</p>

<p><strong>Does the 5-7% guess apply only to the US market?</strong></p>

<p>I didn't write (nor read) the books in question, but most likely that is a global number.  The US dominates the global equity market, so it's often a good proxy.  However, international returns taken together have no less risk and earn no less over long horizons in general.  The particular examples you have pointed out are special cases that only apply to a part of the global economy and a particular time period.  There are plenty of examples of stock markets and time periods that did much <em>better</em> than the US market to offset your examples.</p>

<p><strong>Is 5-7% a reasonable long-term estimate of equity returns?</strong></p>

<p>Equity will always earn more in expectation than risk-free securities will.  How much more depends on major economic factors.  5-7% has been a good estimate for the market risk premium for many, many decades (stocks should earn this <em>plus</em> whatever the risk-free rate is).  However, that is just an empirical observation, not a rule.  It can change.  Some day technological progress could slow down or stop, we could run out of important resources in a way that we can't compensate for, our population permanently could stop growing, aliens could invade, etc. </p>

<p>Down the road it is certainly possible for expected equity returns to go down and never go back up again.  This would result from a permanent, global, economic shift that I think would be pretty obvious.  That is, you wouldn't have to look at stock prices to know it was happening.</p>

"Closed account, haven't received payment. When has the bank ""stolen"" my money?","9316","","<h3>Background</h3>

<p>I closed a checking account over 40 days ago at a large national bank in the US. I was told I would receive a check for the remainder (>$1000) in one to two weeks. I still have not received the check.</p>

<p>I have called their phone support and visited my local branch several times since with no success. Each meeting ends with a vague reference to ""sorting things out with the back office"". My last meeting was with a branch manager who said he would handle the issue personally and contact me when I could come in, sign an affidavit (that I hadn't received the check), and be paid out by the local branch. This was over a week ago now with no follow-up.</p>

<h3>Question</h3>

<p>What are my options? I'd like to get the check with as few trips/calls as possible from here. Is there a way to put some pressure on them to take this more seriously? Is there a length of time before I can report the money as stolen (I'm sure that isn't the correct term in this case)?</p>

<h3>Additional Info</h3>

<p>My original plan was to close the account in person to receive the funds immediately. Chase's tellers do not have the authority to close an account and there were no bankers available to help me that day so I was referred to the phone support which I used. The only drawback of the phone method appeared to be a 5-7 day delay on receiving the check.</p>

<p>Why did I not withdraw the money before closing the account on the phone? Chase charges a $10/month fee for allowing your balance to fall below a certain minimum ($1500). I did not want to find myself arguing about a $10 charge afterwards for having a 0$ balance for a day between the bank visit and the phone call.</p>

<h2>UPDATE:</h2>

<p>I have taken JohnFx's advice and filed a complaint with the OCC. The process was very straightforward and involved including contact information for all relevant parties and, in my case, an issue summary and timeline of my contact attempts with Chase (with confirmation numbers, names, etc). At this point, OCC will contact the bank on my behalf who will be expected to respond to me and copy them on the correspondence.</p>

They take that into account right from the beginning, along with whether they'll make a profit lending you money, or have to spend something to subsidize your zero percent loan. However unlike your veteran's status, your loan intentions are changeable. So when you get to the end you can ask if the price could be improved by paying cash.

At this point in your life they are more interested in the consumer loyalty of a gainful employed young person than the small chance you might lose your job or lie about your income. They might not give you a high limit, but I suspect it would be approved if applied. And it is probably best to establish your larger limit sooner rather than later.</p>

<ol>

<li><p>Businesses don't offer 0% credit for free, and they don't lose money on the deal.  When you shop at a store that offers 0% credit, you are generally overpaying for the item.  By shopping at a store that does not offer 0% credit, you might be able to get a better price.</p></li>
<li><p>Your savings account is likely earning very little interest.  You might invest the money you intend for your purchases in a place that gets better returns, but in most of these places the returns are not guaranteed, and you might not do as well as you think.</p></li>
<li><p>0% loans typically come with lots of conditions that have very heavy penalties and interest rate hikes for late payments.  You can mitigate this risk by setting up automatic payments, but things can still go wrong.  Your bank might change your account number, making the automated payment fail.

"Why is my student loan balance not going down?","9198","","<p>This will be basic for you pros, please forgive me.</p>

<p>I have been paying the minimum balance on my student loan all year, but the balance shown on the site has barely gone down.  I assumed that this was because they make you pay the interest first, then the principal.  However, when I looked at the payoff amount, it was about the same as the balance!  How is this possible?</p>
","<p>While it's common to think of it that way - pay off the interest first, then the principal - that's not actually how your payments work over time.  It's true of any <em>one</em> payment, though.</p>

<p>Interest is earned over time.  It might be added on daily, weekly, monthly, or any other frequency.  For simplicity's sake, let's assume it is added 1/12*(apr) once per month.</p>

<p>So you have a 6% loan, starting at $10,000 principal balance.  That's 0.5% per month (6%/12).  So each month, you owe .005*(principal) in interest.</p>

<p>Your first month, then, you owe:</p>

<pre><code>$10,000 Principal
$    50 Interest
-------
$10,050 Total
</code></pre>

<p>You will always pay at least the interest every month.  Some payment plans are called ""interest-only""; in those, you pay only that $50 per month, and the $10,000 never goes down for the interest-only period.  (Of course, eventually you have to start paying principal...)</p>

<p>Any amount you pay over $50 per month, either as part of your payment or as extra (and extra designated to go to principal - an important distinction), will lower that principal.  That's what actually pays off the loan.</p>

<p>Since payments to principal reduce the total amount you owe, they also reduce the interest due.  So a $100 monthly payment, with $50 going to interest and $50 to principal, would then leave you with, next month:</p>

<pre><code>$ 9,950.00 Principal
$    49.75 Interest
----------
$  9999.75 Total
</code></pre>

<p>You'd then pay $100 again, with now $49.75 paying interest and $50.25 paying principal.</p>

<p>The reason people think of this as paying interest first, is in particular with some mortgages and longer term repayment plans the far majority (commonly 80%, but in some cases higher) of each payment is allocated to paying the interest on the loan.  The way these plans work is that you have a fixed monthly payment for, say, 30 years - but that's at first nearly entirely interest, because you don't have to pay much principal off to eventually get the loan paid off.  </p>

<p>For example, to pay off that loan in 30 years, you'd only have to pay $60 per month - $50 for interest initially and $10 for principal.  Since that principal will slowly rise over time (as interest slowly drops), you end up paying it off.  (30 years is 360 payments, or about $21,600 - so you're going to pay a lot of interest this way, of course, over 100% interest over the life of the loan).  </p>

<p>Since you're only paying $10 to principal each month to start with, if you add even a small amount to that payment, you pay it off <em>far</em> faster and pay far less interest.  Add $15 to your payment - $75 instead of $60 - and now you're paying $25 to principal instead of $10, meaning you now pay it off in 18 years at that payment structure and pay only a bit over $16,000 in total - saving nearly half of the interest.  Add $40 ($100 per month) and you now pay it off in closer to 10 years, and pay $14,000 in total.  Even just add that for the first few years, and you'll dramatically increase your payoff rate.</p>

<p>I recommend using a mortgage payoff calculator, like <a href=""http://www.bankrate.com/calculators/mortgages/mortgage-calculator.aspx?loanAmount=10000&amp;years=30.000&amp;terms=360&amp;interestRate=6.000&amp;loanStartDate=01+Mar+2016&amp;show=true&amp;showRt=false&amp;prods=1&amp;monthlyAdditionalAmount=40&amp;yearlyAdditionalAmount=0&amp;yearlyPaymentMonth=+Mar+&amp;oneTimeAdditionalPayment=0&amp;oneTimeAdditionalPaymentInMY=+Apr+2016&amp;ic_id=mtg_calc_amortization_btn"" rel=""noreferrer"">this one</a> which I set up with the above loan, to see how things work out.  It shows you the amount going to principal and interest each year, and lets you alter the payments to see how they affect things.</p>

<p>Here are charts of the three options, so you can see visually how your payments break down.  Like above, this assumes interest is calculated and capitalized monthly (which may be an oversimplification for your loan, but it doesn't change the numbers much).</p>

"Is there a reason why someone shouldn't buy into a temporarily cheap currency of an otherwise solid economy?","9185","","<p>As everyone knows, the ruble is falling compared to the euro and <a href=""http://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=RUB&amp;to=EUR&amp;view=2Y"">it has been falling for a long time already</a>.</p>

<p>The way I see it, the ruble will eventually get back up once the political situation around it is resolved. Is it naive to think I can just exchange - say, 500€ - for its equivalent in rubles, wait until the currency is back on its feet and then exchange it back now that it will return me more euros for the same amount of rubles?</p>

<p>For example, if I use €<code>500</code> today and exchange it for rubles at today's rate (<code>0.01349</code>) I receive <code>37064.5</code> rubles (<code>74.1290 * 500</code>).</p>

<p>Taking the rate of about 2 years ago on March 12 2013, we see an exchange rate of <code>0.02500</code>. That would mean I get €1 for every <code>40</code> rubles, resulting in a total of €<code>926.6125</code> (<code>37064.5 / 40</code>).</p>

<p>Aside from the fact that you don't have access to your €500 in that period, is there any reason why someone <em>shouldn't</em> buy a cheap currency of an economy that's bound to bounce back?</p>

<p><em>Edit to address a common remark:</em></p>

<p>Isn't there a significant difference if you look at it from a short term vs a long term perspective? 
I would think that many companies with rubles step away from it so they don't endanger their operations with a shortage of money or being forced to lend more money (and as such incur interest rates).</p>

<p>Myself, on the other hand, can wait for years since it is ""extra"" money and I am not bound to the weak currency. </p>

<p>Does this lower currency rate really indicate that experts don't see much value in the ruble in the long term?</p>
","<p>What you are describing is a <em>speculation</em>. Particularly, a <em>long-term</em> speculation. You propose to place a bet that:</p>

<ol>
<li>Your particular view of the fundamentals is correct (which it might be)</li>
<li>Whatever shorter-term dislocations that cause major market players to price the ruble differently from how they otherwise would are bound to change within your investment horizon (which might happen).</li>
</ol>

<p>But as with all bets, it's better to <em>know</em>, which, for a person like you or me, is kind of problematic.</p>

<p>For example, my wife works in a bank, doing finance, and I myself sort of look at the market, then this happened:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jNuEZ.png"" alt=""Enter image description here""></p>

<p>... Did we see the spike coming? No, we did not. We saw only the general trend, and even that not to real numbers. Can we explain that spike? Well, ""some sort of fishy stuff is going on"" is my best answer. Last time some big and fishy stuff was going on, the oil was up to US$140 a barrel and then down to almost US$30. The big boys were fighting and some of them blew up.</p>

<p>I'd say that betting on the ruble before whatever thing is <em>going to happen in the <strong>West</em></strong> is resolved might be a risky business. And I live in Russia. And I watch things. And I don't really know. What I do know, last time both the ruble and Russian stock market went up after the game in the West was resolved, with exactly zero change of economy or political leadership, so the change of either of that is not strictly required.</p>

<p>Another point is not to hold paper money long-term. I am not sure if you assumed holding paper or having a bank account paying up to 20% yearly (in rubles they do).</p>

<p>With the way this question was asked, my guess is that you are new to this; your best bet would be education. Not necessarily a formal education, self-education will do. Do some research. Make some decisions. Write them down or execute them on some small scale (maybe 500€ is a small enough scale for you; I recall losing real money helps memory and motivation somewhat), then wait and observe. Meanwhile, get good at your primary job.</p>

"Why invest for the long-term rather than buy and sell for quick, big gains?","9175","","<p>Somewhat along the lines of <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/56475/is-it-unreasonable-to-double-your-investment-year-over-year"">this question</a>. I've been putting mostly unmatched money into my 401(k) for a few years. I know that investing is generally seen as a long-term decision, but with volatile stocks, it seems to me that you could make a large amount of money by buying low and selling high just a few months later. I also know I'm far from the first person to think this and there's probably a technical term for this practice.</p>

<p>I was looking at some charts and it seems a lot of companies' stock prices have gone down significantly since around October, which correlates with the market scare around that time. <strong>If</strong> they return to their earlier prices, I could make 20-50% in a short amount of time, and repeat that each time a company goes into a slump. Assuming I don't make too many poor choices, what incentive do I have to invest in relatively stable companies over a long period of time vs. volatile stocks for a few months? Why is this quick-buy-quick-sell-quick-win generally not seen as a good or sensible practice?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> To make this quick buying and selling possible, I would adopt a guideline of ""sell when you've made X%, even if it looks like it might go higher."" Holding the stock for a longer period of time to see how it continues to do is precisely the practice that I'm challenging in this question.</p>
","<p>There are people (well, companies) who make money doing <em>roughly</em> what you describe, but not exactly. They're called ""market makers"". Their value for X% is somewhere on the scale of 1% (that is to say: a scale at which almost everything is ""volatile""), but they use leverage, shorting and hedging to complicate things to the point where it's nothing like a simple as making a 1% profit every time they trade. Their actions tend to reduce volatility and increase liquidity.</p>

<p>The reason you can't do this is that you don't have enough capital to do what market makers do, and you don't receive any advantages that the exchange might offer to official market makers in return for them contracting to always make both buy bids and sell offers (at different prices, hence the ""bid-offer spread""). They have to be able to cover large short-term losses on individual stocks, but when the stock doesn't move too much they do make profits from the spread.</p>

<p>The reason you can't just buy a lot of volatile stocks ""assuming I don't make too many poor choices"", is that the reason the stocks are volatile is that nobody knows which ones are the good choices and which ones are the poor choices. So if you buy volatile stocks then you <em>will</em> buy a bunch of losers, so what's your strategy for ensuring there aren't ""too many""? Supposing that you're going to hold 10 stocks, with 10% of your money in each, what do you do the first time all 10 of them fall the day after you bought them? Or maybe not all 10, but suppose 75% of your holdings give no impression that they're going to hit your target any time soon. Do you just sit tight and stop trading until one of them hits your X% target (in which case you start to look a little bit more like a long-term investor after all), or are you tempted to change your strategy as the months and years roll by?</p>

<p>If you will eventually sell things at a loss to make cash available for new trades, then you cannot assess your strategy ""as if"" you always make an X% gain, since that isn't true. If you don't ever sell at a loss, then you'll inevitably sometimes have no cash to trade with through picking losers. The big practical question then is when that state of affairs persists, for how long, and whether it's in force when you want to spend the money on something other than investing.</p>

<p>So sure, if you used a short-term time machine to know in advance which volatile stocks are the good ones today, then it would be more profitable to day-trade those than it would be to invest for the long term. Investing on the assumption that you'll only pick short-term winners is basically the same as assuming you have that time machine ;-)</p>

<p>There are various strategies for analysing the market and trying to find ways to more modestly do what market makers do, which is to take profit from the inherent volatility of the market. <strong>The simple strategy you describe isn't complete and cannot be assessed since you don't say how to decide what to buy</strong>, but the selling strategy ""sell as soon as I've made X% but not otherwise"" can certainly be improved. If you're keen you can test a give strategy for yourself using historical share price data (or current share price data: run an imaginary account and see how you're doing in 12 months). When using historical data you have to be realistic about how you'd choose what stocks to buy each day, or else you're just cheating at solitaire. When using current data you have to beware that there might not be a major market slump in the next 12 months, in which case you won't know how your strategy performs under conditions that it inevitably will meet eventually if you run it for real. You also have to be sure in either case to factor in the transaction costs you'd be paying, and the fact that you're buying at the offer price and selling at the bid price, you <em>can't</em> trade at the headline mid-market price.</p>

<p>Finally, you have to consider that to do pure technical analysis as an individual, you are in effect competing against a bank that's camped on top of the exchange to get fastest possible access to trade, it has a supercomputer and a team of whizz-kids, and it's trying to find and extract the same opportunities you are. This is not to say the plucky underdog can't do well, but there are systematic reasons not to just assume you will. So folks investing for their retirement generally prefer a low-risk strategy that plays the averages and settles for taking long-term trends.</p>

"Could the loan officer deny me even if I have the money as a first time home buyer?","9118","","<p>As of right now I am a senior in college in the United States. I have managed to secure a job once I graduate in May making around 78K. I started working at my year long internship in May of this year. My plan was to try and buy a small condo/townhouse.  That way I gain equity in the residence I live in rather rent an apartment. I found this $150,000 condo which I planned to put at least $12,000 down. The going rate for a 30-year fixed loan is around 4%. I understand that the rate could change due to my circumstances. My question is, even if I have the money for the down payment, could the loan officer still deny me the loan because I don't have at least a ""year's"" worth of constant income?</p>
","<p><strong>A financial institution is not obligated to offer you a loan.</strong> They will only offer you a loan if they believe that they will make money off you. They use all the info available in order to determine if offering you a loan is profitable. </p>

<p><strong>In short, whether they offer you a loan, and the interest rate they charge for that loan, is based on a few things</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>How much does it cost the bank to borrow money? [aka: how much does the bank need to pay people who have savings accounts with them?];</p></li>
<li><p>How much does the bank need to spend in order to administer the loan? [ie: the loan officer's time, a little time for the IT guy who helps around the office, office space they are renting in order to allow the transaction to take place]; and</p></li>
<li><p>How many people will 'default' and never be able to repay their loan? [ex: if 1 out of 100 people default on their loans, then every one of those 100 loans needs to be charged an extra 1% in order to recover the money the bank will lose on the person who defaults].</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>What we are mostly interested in here is #3: how likely are you to default?</strong> The bank determines that by determining your income, your assets, your current debts outstanding, your past history with payments (also called a credit score), and specifically to mortgages, how much the house is worth. </p>

<p>If you don't have a long credit history, and because you don't have a long income history, <em>and</em> because you are putting &lt;10% down on the condo [20% is often a good % to strive for, and paying less than that can often imply you will need mandatory mortgage insurance, depending on jurisdiction] the bank is a little more uncertain about your likelihood to pay. </p>

<p><strong>Banks don't like uncertainty, and they can deal with that uncertainty in two ways</strong>: (1) They can charge you a higher interest rate; OR (2) They can refuse you the loan.</p>

<p>Now just because one bank refuses you a loan, doesn't mean all will - but being refused by one bank is probably a good indication that many / most institutions would refuse you, because they all use very similar analytical tools to determine your 'risk level'.</p>

<p>If you are refused a loan, you can try again at another institution, or you can wait, save a larger down payment, and build your credit history by faithfully paying your credit card every month, paying your utilities, and making your car and rent payments on time. This will give the banks more comfort that you will have the ability to pay your mortgage every month, and a larger down payment will give them comfort that if the housing market dips, you won't owe more than the house is worth.</p>

<p><strong>My parting shot is this: If you are new in your career with no income history, be very careful about buying a property immediately, even if you get approved</strong>. A good rule of thumb is to only buy a property when you plan on living there for at least 5 years, or else you are likely to lose money overall, after factoring closing costs and maintenance fees. If you are refused a loan, that's probably a good sign that you aren't financially ready yet, but even if a bank approves you for a loan, you might not be ready yet either.</p>

"Isn't the security of credit cards with chip worse than with signature?","9098","","<p>(I'd expect this question to be duplicate, but couldn't find any that matches the point)</p>

<p>It seems to me that the security of credit card transactions got <em>worse</em> by the switch from signing to chip usage. As is well known, nearly all providers in the US do not ask the PIN when paying (supposedly because Americans wouldn't be ble to remember a PIN), so the comparison to me is:</p>

<p><strong>Before</strong>: If I lose the card, the finder needs to fake my signature (not too difficult, but not a freebie); if I mark the card with 'Check ID', there is a <em>chance</em> that he fails.</p>

<p><strong>Now</strong>: If I lose the card, anyone can use it freely anywhere. No limits, zero risk of getting caught.</p>

<p>So we got a new system that is slower, and makes abusing lost / stolen cards <em>easier</em>?? Why?</p>

<p>I am aware that you can call the credit card company and report the card stolen, but that is not always as easy. When you are travelling, roaming can cost you easily 100 $ just while your call is in the wait line, and many 1-800 numbers are not even callable from outside the US. Anyway, that is not the point -</p>

<p><em>why would the industry burn money into a system that makes stealing and then quickly using credit cards easier?</em></p>
","<p>One advantage of the chip cards is that the card information needed to make purchases can't be easily skimmed or ""stolen"".  Another is that it is more difficult to create a fake physical card.  These advantages still exist regardless of what form of verification is used (or even if no verification is used).</p>

<p>The type of fraud you're describing, in which your card is physically lost or stolen, is a relatively small proportion of total fraud (14% according to <a href=""http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/credit-card-security-id-theft-fraud-statistics-1276.php"">this site</a>).  One reason this is not as big a problem is that often, if you lose your card or get robbed, you know the card is compromised and you can cancel it.  (Even if it takes you a while to do this, at least you are on the alert.)  The real danger comes when your card info is stolen without your knowledge, and this is harder to do with a chip card.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that there are more ways for a fraudster to get nabbed than being caught red-handed entering the wrong PIN at the point of sale.  The credit card companies are still tracking card usage and watching for unusual purchases that might indicate fraud.  Also, sometimes fraudsters do surprisingly dumb stuff, like use the card to buy something online and mail it to themselves.  So it's not correct to say that there is ""zero risk of getting caught"".  With both stripe and chip cards, you can catch the person by tracking them via their usage of the card.</p>

<p>The biggest security risk with the new cards is that many vendors don't actually require use of the chip at all -- they still let you swipe.  However, with changes to credit card liability policies, this is a risk for the vendors, not for you.</p>

<p>My friend and I were in Vegas and had two hours to kill before catching our flights. We decided to indulge in some Blackjack&mdash;we figured $100 each, playing at min-bet tables, would entertain us for most of that time. But alas, our ATM cards were buried in our suitcases at the valet&mdash;and we decided it wasn't worth the effort and time retrieving them. <em>But</em>, I said why not a cash advance, and we decided it <em>was</em> worth the fee (which turned out to be 5%, minimum $10) to take a modest cash advance (again, $200), for the fun we'd have for two more hours. Still, we were a bit freaked out by the idea of gambling-on-credit. It was only the fact that we had commited to playing $100 each, <em>before</em> reaching into our pockets and realizing we didn't have our ATM cards, that convinced us we weren't gambling irresponsibly in this case&mdash;only paying a fee for convenience. Yes, one could argue it's a slippery slope, but we feel we're introspective enough to know not to do that again. I hope this post doesn't ever encourage anyone to gamble on credit&mdash;you can't beat the house advantage&mdash;and if you're smart enough to, then you can surely find some other way to raise ""capital"" before you try(&mdash;and if you <em>can't</em>, then you might want to reconsider whether you really <em>are</em> smart enough to beat the house advantage ;-)</p>

<hr>

<p>Anyway, if a cash advance could hurt a person's credit, it definitely wouldn't have been worth it!</p>

<p>I don't see a logical reason that cash advances should be held against anyone, any more than spending on credit (in general) should, especially if the balance is paid in full each month. I feel like either way, you're offered flexibility (whether electronic or cash) according to your credit history, and you've agreed to pay high interest rates if you were to carry that advantage across more than a billing cycle.</p>

<p>So, what does Money.SE think? Does anyone have any personal experience? Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>While 'cash advances' appears on the list of highlighted risk items, I've still not seen this implemented.

"401k withdrawal abroad and state taxation?","9015","","<p>From what I know about 401k's, when it's time to retire, we take our 401k money and pay federal and state tax. Some states don't have taxes on 401k's — Florida is a good example. So many people move to Florida for a retirement, not to pay taxes (that's why people call it heaven's waiting room). The question is - how does it work if a US citizen permanently moves to another country for a retirement (retaining citizenship, but not living in any of the US states)? Are there any state taxes? If yes, then why?</p>
","<p>It essentially works the same. Some states don't have any income taxes at all (like Florida or Wyoming), some only tax income derived in the state, and some tax worldwide income (like New York or California), similarly to the Federal income taxes.</p>

<p>However, if you're <em>living</em> abroad (i.e.: you're a citizen or resident of a foreign country and you live there), you're not considered resident by most of the states (check with your state for specific definitions) for most, if not all, the time of your residency abroad. In such case - you don't pay state taxes, only Federal.</p>

<p>You have to remember that foreign income exclusion doesn't apply to the income from your 401k, so you pay the taxes as if you're in the US. You can not use foreign taxes credit as well (but depending on the tax treaty with the country you're moving to, your 401k income might not be taxable there). In some cases you may end up with double taxation: US will tax your 401k income as you're a US citizen and the income is derived from the US sources, and the foreign country will tax the income based on its own laws.</p>

<p>So if you <em>literally</em> bought two shares, then the SEC added one penny in fees and FINRA added one penny as a ""Trading Activity Fee""</p>

<p>Note that there are several other fees on their schedule that may not apply to you.</p>

<p>If you had bought 100 shares instead, your total fees would have still been only 2 cents, but you would have lost $4 on the trade.  So the fees are minuscule when you start doing larger orders.  </p>

<p>However, That should not discourage you from experimenting and learning.  I'd rather pay 2 cents in fees on a 4 cent loss than 2 cents in fees on a $400 loss.  Just chalk it up to the cost of experience.</p>

"Everyone says save at least 10% of your income. What counts as ""saving""?","8901","","<p>I made a financial planning spreadsheet a while back. Then, I realized that the money I'm saving has specific allocations.</p>

<p>This much goes to the future car payment. This much goes to the new PC I'm building. This much goes to something else I'll be buying in the future.</p>

<p>Should I count the money I'm putting into my future car purchase as ""saving""? Should I count the money I'm putting into a house downpayment as ""saving""?</p>

<p>Or does saving only count for the money I actually save that I don't plan on spending?</p>

<hr>

<p>This looks like quite a subjective question. But, basically the question is, when does saving count? </p>

<p>This is particularly important for me so that I would know if I need to save more than what I actually am saving currently.</p>
","<p>It doesn't really make sense to worry about the details of ""what counts as saving"" unless you also move beyond a simplistic rule of thumb like ""save 10% of your income"".</p>

<p>That said, most of the sources I see pushing rules of thumb like that are talking about saving <em>for retirement</em>.  That is, you need to sock that money away so you will be able to spend it after you retire.  (<a href=""http://money.cnn.com/retirement/guide/basics_basics.moneymag/index7.htm"">This CNN page</a> is one example.)  On that theory, it only ""counts"" if you put it away and don't touch it until you retire, so things like car and computer funds would not count as saving.</p>

<p>Another thing you'll see some people say (e.g., <a href=""http://lifehacker.com/the-20-question-how-much-of-my-pay-should-i-really-sa-1443199935"">this Nerdwallet article</a>) is to use 20% of your income for ""financial priorities"".  This would include retirement saving, but also things like paying off debt and saving for a down payment on a house.</p>

<p>Saving for a small purchase in the near future would not usually be considered ""saving"" at all, since you're not going to keep the money.  If you put $5 in your wallet tonight so you can buy a hamburger for lunch tomorrow, you wouldn't call that saving; likewise setting aside a few hundred dollars for a new computer wouldn't ""count"" as saving under most definitions.  (Some people might ""count"" saving for something like a house, since that is a long-term plan and the house, unlike a computer, may rise in value after you buy it.  But you wouldn't want to fully count the house as part of your retirement savings unless you're willing to sell it and live off the proceeds.)</p>

<p>However, none of these rules will help that much if your goal is, as you say at the end of your question, to ""know if I need to save more than what I actually am saving currently"".  Saving 10% of your income won't magically ensure that you're saving ""enough"".  To assess whether you personally are saving ""enough"", you need to actually start running some numbers on how much money you personally will need in retirement.  This will depend on any number of factors, including where you live, what sources of retirement income you might have besides savings (e.g., pensions), etc.  In short, to know if you're saving enough, you can't listen to the generic stuff that ""everyone says""; you need to consider your own situation in a deliberate, focused way.</p>

","<p>That is the maintenance margin required for that position.  Whenever you trade using your margin account, you must (by law, and also separately often by stricter policies from the brokerage) have a certain percentage of equity - at least 25%, often higher.  That protects the brokerage from significant losses if your position drops in value significantly (hopefully preventing the brokerage from failing outright in the event of a major collapse).  If the amount of equity falls below the maintenance requirement, you will have a margin call and be required to put some cash (or equity) into the account to maintain that level.</p>

However, Rausch Coleman Homes is offering very nice and <code>SUPER CHEAP</code> houses for $75 per square foot. The only problem is they do not have gas. </p>

<p>So I don't understand, is it because Rausch Coleman houses do not have gas that the price is so cheap? Or what? Their prices are very tempting, but I'm hesitating to buy because I don't know where is the catch.</p>

<p>I asked my real estate agent about it, but she was not able to give me a meaningful answer.</p>
","<p>In northwest Arkansas, most of the houses this company offers do cost about 90 - 110 dollars per square foot.  The exceptions use the Whitney plan, which has the following design features (and/or problems) which happen to save the builder a lot of money:</p>

<ul>
<li>Most rooms only have ""light on one side"", not ""light on two sides"".  And the few windows are rather small.</li>
<li>The porch is too shallow to be very useful.</li>
<li>The house is a square box, which reduces material and labor costs.</li>
<li>The house does not have a front walk directly from the sidewalk to the porch.</li>
<li>The builder has aggressively value engineered the house.  The two porch posts are probably perfectly adequate structurally -- but aesthetically, three posts that are wrapped to be thicker would look better.  Similarly, the roof slope is optimal for lower construction cost, but might not be visible enough from the street for optimal curb appeal.  There are probably similar cost saving measures throughout the house.</li>
<li>Two of the bedrooms are over the garage.</li>
<li>Three bedrooms share one bathroom.</li>
<li>In the master bathroom, there is little privacy between the toilet area and the shower area.  In particular, there is no door between them, and the toilet area does not have its own sink.</li>
<li>Would you really find the ""bonus room"" useful?  It counts for a lot of square footage.  (In Seattle, Asian families that custom build tend to include similar rooms, but most other families do not include big central bonus rooms like this on the bedroom floor.)</li>
<li>Do you really need a separate ""Breakfast"" area and ""Dining Room"", neither of which is an actual room?</li>
<li>Almost all of the plumbing is in a very small fraction of the house.</li>
<li>All of the doors are swing doors, even where pocket doors (with visible handles) would make more sense.</li>
</ul>

<p>One very nice feature is the U-shaped stairway in the center of the house.  It is easy to find, and has an angled landing.  It might be a bit narrow, though.</p>

<p>Does the builder bother to put rebar in the brickwork?  Arkansas is in earthquake country.</p>

<p>What are the floors like?  Is the first floor a slab concrete floor with vinyl flooring (and/or carpet on thin pad) immediately above the concrete?  Is the second floor bouncy, due to using long-span joists of code-minimum size?</p>

<p>Does the builder bother to make the rear windows look as nice as the front windows?  As mentioned earlier, the builder only bothers to have one side window.</p>

","<p>Unsecured debt, like credit card debt, will be paid by the estate.  If not enough money exists in the estate (including selling property/etc.) to satisfy the debts, then the debt will be cancelled - it is not continued on to the heirs/etc.</p>

<p>As far as if a charge posts after the death - likely depends on if it was fraudulently used.  If the person owning the card made the purchase and timing just was off, then it'll be just as if they paid beforehand.

"Why is it rational to pay out a dividend?","8862","","<p>Imagine a mature company, which has stable earnings and made a profit this year. The company is planing to pay out a part of this earnings to its shareholders. Assuming the stock price goes down exactly what is paid out per share the shareholders wealth doesn't change.</p>

<p>Now a few weeks later the company decides to start a new project, for which it needs to borrow money (because it paid out its excess returns) and therefore pay some interest for this borrowed money. Even when it would not do any investments it could lend the excess money to someone else and earn a little interest on that.</p>

<p>When the company doesn't pay a dividend the money stays within the company and therefore the company is worth more, which will be reflected in the share price (assuming efficient markets). So when the shareholders need money they could sell some of their (higher priced) stocks.</p>

<p>As we see from the example above the company can either choose to pay out the money and earn nothing, or keep the money and use it for investments or earn some interest on it.
The company has an (opportunity) cost by paying out dividends, and is therefore not the optimal choice to do so.</p>

<p>Also if we assume that the increase in the share price is generally taxed as a capital gain, and capital gains are often taxed at a lower rate than income in the case of dividends.</p>

<p>So my question is: <strong>Why does it make sense, from a <em>economically rational</em> point of view, assuming both the company and also the investors want to maximize the shareholders value, to pay out a dividend?</strong> </p>
","<p>The main reason, as far as I can see, is that the dividends are payments with which the shareholders may do what they want.</p>

<p>Capital that the company has no use for does not make a significant positive return on investment, as you pointed out, yes the company could accrue interest, but that is not going to make the company large sums of cash.</p>

<p>While the company may be great at making shoes - maybe even the best in the world - doesn't mean they are good investors. Sure they could dabble at using their capital to invest in other equities, but they don't, because they just want to focus on making shoes.</p>

<p>If the dividend goes to the investors, they can do what they wish, be it reinvest in the company, or invest elsewhere. Other companies that may make good use of the capital, and create significant returns on it are one such example.</p>

<p>That is the rational answer, beyond that, one of the main reasons is that people like the feeling of receiving dividends - it might not be the answer you are looking for, but many people prefer companies that pay dividends for no rational reason over companies which grow their asset value.</p>

<p>Is it ever a good idea to close credit cards?</p>
","<p>Yes, it can be a good idea to close unused credit cards.  I am going to give some reasons why it can be a good idea to close unused accounts, and then I will talk about why it is NOT necessarily a bad idea.</p>

<p><strong>Why it can be a good idea to close unused accounts</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>""I'd like to close the cards.""  That is reason enough.  </p></li>
<li><p>Simplifying your financial life is a good thing.  Fewer accounts let you focus your energy on the accounts that you actually use.</p></li>
<li><p>Unused accounts still need to be monitored for fraud.</p></li>
<li><p>You mentioned that you have high credit card balances that you are carrying.  This may indicate that you have trouble using credit responsibly, and having more credit available to you might be a temptation for you.</p></li>
<li><p>If these unused cards have annual fees, keeping them open will cost money.</p></li>
<li><p>Unused cards sometimes get closed by the bank due to inactivity.  As a result, the advice often given is that, in addition to not closing them, you are supposed to charge something to it every month.  This, of course, takes more of your time and energy to worry about, as well as giving you another monthly bill to pay.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Why it is NOT necessarily a bad idea to close unused accounts</strong></p>

<p>Other answers will tell you that it may hurt your credit score for two reasons: it would increase your utilization and lower your average account age.  Before we talk about the validity of these two points, we need to discuss the importance of the credit score.</p>

<p>Depending on what your credit score currently is, these actions may have minimal impact on your life.  If you are in the mid 700's or higher, <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/q/59243/10997"">your score is excellent</a>, and closing these cards will likely not impact anything for you in a significant way.</p>

<p>If you aren't that high in your score yet, do you have an immediate need for a high score?  Are you planning on getting more credit cards, or take out any more loans?  I would suggest that, since you have credit card debt, you shouldn't be taking out any new loans until you get that cleaned up.  So your score in the mean time is not very important.</p>

<p>Are you currently working on eliminating this credit card debt?  If so, your utilization number will improve, even after you close these accounts, when you get those paid off.  Utilization has only a temporary effect on your score; when your utilization improves, your score improves immediately.</p>

<p>Your average account age may or may not improve when you close these accounts, depending on how old they are compared to the accounts you are leaving open.  However, the impact of this might not be as much as you think.</p>

<p>I realize that this advice is different from other answers, or other things that you may read online.  But in my own life, I do a lot of things that are supposedly bad for the credit score: I only have two credit cards, ages 2.5 and 1.5 years.  (I closed my other cards when I got these.)  My typical monthly utilization is around 25% on these cards, although I pay off the balance in full each month, never paying interest.  I have no car loan anymore, and my mortgage is only 4 months old.  No other debt.  Despite those ""terrible"" credit practices, my credit score is very high.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Make your payments on time, get out of debt, and your score will be fine.  Don't keep unwanted accounts open just because someone told you that you should.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there a tax advantage to putting 100% of my bonus into 401k?</p>

<p>No. You can adjust your withholding rate using updated form W4, to account for the extra withheld because of the bonus.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From looking at my pay stubs, my bonus gets taxed at a higher rate

</blockquote>

<p>Bonus tax withholding can be upwards of 40% after federal (25%) and state taxes. For some its higher rate, for others it may in fact be lower.</p>

<p>Federal withholding for lump-sum payments is <em>usually</em> <strong>flat</strong> 25% (usually, because the employers can, <em>if they want to</em>, adjust their withholding calculations to account for the bonus, and then withhold the ""regular"" amount. But it usually complicates the accounting and most chose not to). Similarly, State withholding is probably calculated at some State-mandated high (closer to the highest bracket) rate. That makes the lump-sum tax calculation simple, but for most people - the withholding will be higher than the actual tax liability. For some (high earners) it will be the opposite - the flat-rate withholding will be lower than their marginal tax and they'll end up underpaying their taxes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And since traditional 401k contributions are pre-tax, the thinking is
  that contributions from my bonus paycheck will save me more in taxes
  than contributions from my regular paychecks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, because the 25% is the withholding, not the actual tax. The actual tax on your whole compensation is calculated using your marginal rates. You'll get the actual amount when you fill your tax return. If because of the extra withholding on your bonus you ended up paying more than you should have - you'll get a refund from the IRS.</p>

","<p>In 2013, an allowance/exemption is like saying, ""Please don't tax $3,900 this year."" So 8 allowances is $31K not taxed. It doesn't wipe out your tax withholding. </p>

"Is it common in the US not to pay medical bills?","8803","","<p><strong>Context:</strong> As a foreigner in the US for a few months, I'm wondering how to react regarding medical bills. Indeed, I had to go to hospital and received medical bills. Surprisingly, some of my colleagues told me in substance: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Don't worry about these bills, you don't have to pay them, no one is doing it here</em>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>(I must clarify that they are wealthy upscale members, who can afford paying these bills.)<br/>
More recently, I stuck upon <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/79084/should-emergency-funds-be-used-for-infrequent-but-likely-expenses#comment132415_79088"">this comment</a> that triggered me and led me to ask this question. This comment globally says: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>some medical providers [...] figure out what you will owe, and that's how much they require (or at best, <strong>simply ask for</strong>)</em> [highlighting is mine.] </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my understanding, this implies that some are not always <em>required</em> to pay these bills. </p>

<p>Regarding my experience, I'm however considering myself obliged by expenses I do, and thus pay what I owe. I've hence paid above mentioned medical bills. (P.-S.: I've paid them in full, since my home-country insurance reimburses my expenses ex post.)</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Is it common in the US not to pay medical bills? Or do I misunderstood what had been said? </p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Is it common in the US not to pay medical bills?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Certainly not.  What some <em>might</em> do, however, is <em>not</em> pay them immediately, with the intent to negotiate them down or get them written off.  You can also see if there's a discount for paying immediately - I've had moderate success with this, but it was during a time where we <em>couldn't</em> pay them all immediately, so I was more trying to figure out which ones to pay first rather than just haggling.  </p>

<p>The obvious risk is that they go to a collections agency and get reported as unpaid debt to your credit.  I'm with you, however - it's a service that you received and it should be paid.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I must precise that they are wealthy upscale members, who can afford paying these bills.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you certain that they <em>have</em> large medical bills?  I suppose it's possible that they have resources that  can negotiate these on their behalf, or they don't care about the impact to their credit score. But to say ""no one is doing it here"" seems ludicrous.</p>

"How to determine how much to charge your business for rent (in your house)?","8791","","<p>I started a business this year and have a dedicated room in my home for this business.  How do I determine the rate at which I will charge the business rent for the space?</p>
","<p>Your best approach is to assess rent levels in your local area for offices of a similar size. You need to take into account all the usuals - amenities, parking, etc, just as if your home-office was provided by a third-party. Get your $/sq ft and work out the monthly amount.</p>

<p>With this figure, you need to then work out what % of it you can charge. If the space is used exclusively for the business, charge 100%. If it's used about half the time, charge 50%, etc.</p>

<p>I would strongly advise you to do two things - 1. make sure your accountant and your attorney help you get this squared away. 2. document everything about how you arrived at the cost. Nothing fancy, but dates, realtors, addresses, $/sq foot. A simple table will do. By doing these two things, if the IRS should come around to chat, you should be covered.</p>

"How to pay with cash when car shopping?","8783","","<p>I am planning to buy a car with cash this weekend - first time car shopping on my own! I've found a decent used car and scheduled a test drive with a dealership, hoping to make a purchase. They've already lowered the price for me via email/phone negotiations, and the salesperson said there's potential for further discounts after I go there in person. To be honest I am pretty happy with their quoted price as it is, so I'm fairly confident of walking out with a new (to me) ride.</p>

<p>What I'm confused about is how a ""cash"" transaction actually works, particularly if I am not certain of the final price of the car. Should I get a cashier's check for my starting offer, and withdraw cash to cover the difference for the price they've already quoted me? Don't withdraw cash, put the difference on a credit card? Get several smaller cashier's checks - e.g. if they told me 14.5 and I wanted 14, get 10k, 4 x 1k, and 500 cash? (That way if it didn't work out and I went with something cheaper I wouldn't have to go back to the bank.)</p>

<p>I am not totally comfortable carrying around the entire amount in bills, although I could if it really is the best option. I never carry a balance on my credit card and would pay it off immediately if used for this.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDIu7bdZuko"" rel=""noreferrer"">Source link</a></p>
","<p>According to the link below, it does appear that you must take an RMD, or Required Minimum Distribution, from your IRA at age 70½, or face a 50% penalty <strong><em>of the RMD AMOUNT that has NOT been taken</em></strong>, which is going to be much less than 50% of your entire account balance. </p>

<p>Why specifically this happens would be opinion based on my interpretation of the reasoning behind those that enacted the law.</p>

<p>I can tell you penalties like this are used to encourage behavior - you can't just leave your money in a tax-free account forever. The IRA is meant to help you build your savings for retirement, and at age 70½ you should be ready for retirement. </p>

<p>This means you must begin withdrawing the money - but that doesn't mean you have to spend it. </p>

<p>In the link below, there are outlines on what you can do to satisfy the required minimum distribution.</p>

"Should I pay off a 0% interest car loan or put money towards high principal student loans?","8763","","<p>Within the past year my wife and I have paid off approximately $40,000 in debt - from her car loan, my two student loans, and other misc debt (new refrigerator, hardwood floor install). I had a car lease expire so I went to purchase a new one and got a 5 year, 0% interest loan, with approximately $20,000 left.</p>

<p>My wife has her doctorate in healthcare and, unfortunately, the student loans racked up and has about $90,000 over the next 26 years.</p>

<p>Based on my estimates we're slated to pay off her student loans within 7 years. We both work full time and I do freelance consulting work on the side. I currently have enough (after taxes) saved from my freelance work to pay off my car or put it towards her student loan.</p>

<p>Which way is better? Should I pay off my car loan and put the $400 per month towards her student loans? Or should I keep paying the car loan and put all our extra money towards her student loans?</p>
","<p>First of all, congratulations on paying off $40k in debt in one year.</p>

<p>Mathematically, you'd be better off making the standard car loan payments and putting your extra money toward the student loan.</p>

<p>However, there are a few other things that you might want to consider.</p>

<p>Over the last year, you've knocked out a whole bunch of different debts.  Feels pretty good, doesn't it?  At your current rate, you could knock out your new car loan in 6 months.  Then you'd only have one debt left.  If it sounds to you like it would be nice to only have one debt left, then it might be worth the mathematical disadvantage you would get by paying off the car early instead of putting the money toward the last student loan.</p>

<p>The car loan is 0%, but if you are late on a single payment, they will take that opportunity to raise your interest rate to something probably higher than the interest rate of your student loan.  For this reason, you may decide it is not worth the hassle, and you'd rather just eliminate the car loan as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Either choice is fine, in my opinion, as long as you have a purpose behind the choice and you are committed to eliminating both debts as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>As an aside, it is important to remember that even a 0% loan is not really free money, and needs to be paid back.  You know this, of course, but sometimes you see a 0% loan advertized and it feels like free money.  It's not.  You have probably already paid for the loan by forfeiting a rebate.  So although, at this point having already taken this loan and paying for it, you will come out ahead by dragging out your car loan for the full term, in the future do not think that you can make money by buying something at 0% interest.</p>

"How does Robinhood stock broker make money?","8760","","<p>I recently downloaded the Robinhood app that states it charges $0 commission for its trades. If so how do they stay in business by doing this? Is there something they are leaving out? </p>
","<p><em>Robinhood</em> seems interesting. Some say it's a gimmicky site with a nice UI not an investing or trading platform.</p>

<p><strong>From <a href=""http://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/020515/how-robinhood-makes-money.asp"">investopedia</a>:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>1.</strong> <em>For now</em>, the app stays afloat for mainly two reasons. First, the business itself is extremely lean: no physical locations, a small
  staff, no massive public relations campaigns and only one operating
  system platform to maintain. Robinhood also generates interest off of
  unused cash deposits from user accounts according to the Federal Funds
  rate.</p>
  
  <p><strong>2.</strong> <em>Second</em>, venture capitalists such as Index Ventures, Ribbit Capital,
  Google Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, Social Leverage,and “many
  others” have invested <em>more than $16 million</em> in the app.</p>
  
  <p><strong>3.</strong> According to Barron’s, Robinhood plans to implement margin trading in
  2015, eventually charging 3.5% interest for the service. E*Trade
  charges 8.44% for accounts under $25,000. Phone assisted trading will
  also be available at $10 per trade in the future.</p>
  
  <p><strong>4.</strong> Originally, Robinhood planned to make money off of order flows – a
  common tactic used by discount brokerages in the 199﻿0s to generate
  revenue. According to the company's FAQ, Robinhood backpedaled on the
  idea because it executes orders through a clearing partner and, as a
  result, receives little to no payment for order flow. The company is
  willing to return to its original plan in the future if it receives
  order flows directly or begins to generate a lot of revenue from them.</p>

If there was not an employer match, should I just go with a traditional IRA?","8752","","<p>I have maxed out my 401K for the past 6 years or so, always hearing how it is advantaged.

Aside from the employer match, which is an obvious direct benefit, what is the 401K really getting me? ""Tax Deferred"" doesn't seem to matter, because I am paying the tax man now or later, so I don't perceive that as a great benefit as I don't need the extra money now.  Is this benefit that I could use extra money now if I really needed to?</p>

<p>Secondly, if there were no employer match, why wouldn't I just go with a Traditional IRA?  Both are tax deferred, and the biggest difference that I understand is the employer match obviously doesn't exist in the non employer plan.  </p>

<p>Thanks for clearing this up for me!</p>
","<p>The tax deferred status of a 401k plan helps you in theory because your tax rate will be lower once you retire and start drawing the money.  This theory could prove incorrect.</p>

<p>Also the money you add to a 401k lowers your taxable income today so you end up paying less taxes to the government right now.  Depending on where you are in the tax bracket scale that could have the affect of lowering your tax bracket which will save you money in other areas.</p>

<p>Each person's situation is different by my general theory is to contribute towards retirement in the following order:</p>

<ol>
<li>401k - contribute enough to get any free money.</li>
<li>Roth IRA - contribute the maximum allowed under the law.</li>
<li>401k - contribute the additional up to the maximum allowed under the law.</li>
<li>Non-retirement account - any additional you want to save just save it in a non-tax deferred account.</li>

","<p>The Hunt brothers were worried about Nixon taking the US off the gold standard in 1971.  They started to purchase silver as a hedge against the devaluing dollar.  They had to purchase silver because it was not legal for Americans to own gold until 1975.</p>

<p>The two wealthy brothers began purchasing silver futures contracts on the commodity exchanges.  The Hunt brothers took delivery of the silver at the expiration of the contract instead of rolling the contract over into a new contract. In 1974 they had managed to acquire around 55 million ounces of physical silver. They charted three 707 planes to transport 40 million ounces of silver from the US to Switzerland.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fw0zx.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>They continued to purchase silver contracts and taking delivery of the silver at the end of the contract.  They were now borrowing money to purchase the contracts.  By 1979 they had purchased 43 million ounces of silver through COMEX and CBOT – the two major commodity exchanges.  </p>

<p>By 1980 they had 90 million ounces of silver in futures contracts.  COMEX and CBOT started to restrict silver trading since it was widely believed the exchanges did not have all the silver to deliver to the Hunt brothers.  First they raised margin requirements.  Then they set limits with regard to the amount of silver contracts that could be held by any one investor.  </p>

<p>Finally in January, 1980 the exchanges halted all trading of silver and forced contract holders to sell any contracts that were over the individual owner limit.  The buyers knew the sellers were forced to sell so the price of silver came crashing down.  The Hunt brothers declared bankruptcy since they could not cover the loans they used to purchase the silver. </p>

<p>Another major factor in the crash of gold and silver was Volker taking over as the Federal Reserve chairman.  Volker raised interest rates substantially reducing the amount of leverage being used to speculate in the market.

","<p>You can do this through a journal entry in Quickbooks.  It can all be entered as one entry, there's no need to do separate ones for each bill.</p>

<p>The journal entry should <strong>debit</strong> Accounts Payable and <strong>credit</strong> your equity account.  In the line for Accounts Payable, make sure to choose your name in the 'Name' column.  This, in effect, enters a credit to your account, which will offset the bills that were shown there previously.</p>

<p>The last step is to apply those credits to the bills.  Even though they offset each other, your name would still show up in any Payables reports and in the Pay Bills window.  To do this, open the Pay Bills window and select one of the bills owed to you.  There should be an option to choose 'Apply Credits' or something similar (depends on which version of Quickbooks you are running).  Choose that option, and apply credits in the amount of the bill, so that it zeroes out.  Do the same for all of the other bills.  Once they are all checked off, click the button to Pay Bills.

"How to lower my rent when it is listed as less than what I am paying","8680","","<p>I live in a large apartment complex that opened last year. I just moved in mid-July 2013 signing a 12-month lease. As of today, the apartment complex is about 30% occupied. There are many units available. On the apartment's website online the rent listed for my unit is now $180 less than what I am paying and they are offering two months free. Most units' rents are listed at lower prices than what they were a week ago.  However, I'm still paying the same amount even though the value of my unit is now less. </p>

<p>I've been a good resident. For the short time I've been here I've always paid my rent on time and am almost always the first to report any issues (broken garage door, security issues, etc) with the apartment. Since I've moved in I've noticed the integrity of the apartment complex dropping - items breaking more often, managers not meeting me when they said they would, employees of the apartment getting drunk and blacking out at outings, area is completely smoke free yet people are smoking in the garage, and maintenance not repairing items immediately.</p>

<p>I've discussed my concerns and why I'm upset that my rent is listed cheaper than what I am paying with the property manager and her supervisor. I've asked to have my rent lowered. They are not willing to change. They did offer if I extend my lease now, so my lease is two years till September 2015 that I would get 1 month free rent, a guarantee that my rent will not increase next year, and I'll continue to pay the same amount I'm paying now (not the $180 less).</p>

<p><strong>How do I get the property manager to lower my rent in this situation?</strong></p>

<p>My thoughts: their deal sounds decent at first, but they are really just working around the problem and trying to get me to sign a longer lease so they meet their quota. Also, given that apartment has been open for a year and there are many available units makes me think that they will be in a similar situation next year and offering an incentive to stay. If that happens, I'm doubting they would want to raise my rent. Lastly, given how the quality of the apartment is dropping recently makes me question if I really want to extend my lease.</p>

<p><strong>Is there any way to negotiate with my property manager to lower my rent without increasing the length of my lease?</strong></p>
","<p>When you took the apartment you agreed to pay the rent you are paying now, and they agreed to rent you an apartment. If apartments were being listed for more than you were currently paying, and your landlord asked you to pay more rent than you agreed because 'your apartment is worth more now', I'm betting you wouldn't agree to it. That's the way renting works.</p>

<p>If you don't mind extending your lease, you might be able to negotiate something there. Try saying you will extend your lease if he guarantees you the price currently being advertised. That's the basis of negotiation - he can give you something you want (lower rent) and you can give him something he wants (extended lease). All you have to do is find a price which is acceptable to both of you.</p>

<p>You might try applying for one of the listed apartments at the new rate, and paying the penalty to break your existing lease early, but I'm betting your landlord won't allow that. Apart from that, just get on with your life. </p>

<p>Like what happens if your friend is driving your vehicle and they get in an accident? If there was a serious threat of that then letting the insurance company know might be prudent, but then again, maybe just not lending the vehicle to my friend would be just as prudent (and would eliminate the issue). But then again, it seems to me that insurance is something you get not because something is probable but because something is possible.</p>
","<p>Most of this content is gleaned from <a href=""https://www.geico.com/more/driving/auto/car-safety-insurance/hey-can-i-borrow-your-car/"">Geico's website</a>:</p>

<p>There is no need to notify the insurance company about this situation, however there are some rules and liabilities to be aware of before you lend the car to someone. In case of an accident, your insurance will be used meaning YOUR deductible and, if damages exceed your coverage, you could be liable for additional damages.</p>

<p>According to Geico, a large US-based insurer <a href=""https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/insurance/car-insurance-basics/largest-auto-insurance-companies/"">handling 10.8% of the market</a>, ""you should ask a few more questions before letting another driver head into the sunset in your vehicle—or before borrowing someone else’s ride.""</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you’re loaning out your car, ask:</p>
  
  <p><strong>Is the borrower licensed to drive?</strong> If they’re visiting from out of state, you don’t need to worry. If they have a driver’s license from another country, check your state’s requirements—the driver may need to apply for an International Driving Permit before he or she arrives in the U.S.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Does the borrower have a good driving record?</strong> If they have a history of fender benders and you keep your vehicle in pristine condition, it’s OK to not hand over the keys.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Is my insurance up to date?</strong> Every state requires a minimum level of auto insurance coverage, and some stipulate that in case of an accident, the car owner’s auto insurance—not the driver’s—provides primary coverage. (So if the driver rear-ends someone or bumps another car in a parking lot and your insurance has lapsed, you could be liable for damages.) Depending on your state’s regulations, you may also want to verify whether the driver has his or her own car insurance.</p>
  
  <p><strong>What do they plan to use the car for?</strong> If it’s any kind of commercial activity, like driving for a ridesharing program, you’ll need to check your auto insurance policy. Again, in many states, the car owner’s auto insurance provides primary coverage. If the car is being driven for commercial purposes and you only have a personal policy, you may not have sufficient coverage.</p>

You might have a tough time taking out other loans if the lender decides that your debt-to-income ratio or balance-to-credit limit is too high -- even if the payment history is perfect.

"The price dropped on an item I purchased 8 days ago. What can I do?","8628","","<p>I bought a PC for € 2199 (about $2500 USD) 8 days ago. Today I saw that the same store where I purchased it sells the same product for € 130 less. Unfortunately, I can't just bring it back* and re-buy it because I have already littered the packaging. What can I do in order not to have paid too much?</p>

<p><sub>* The market claims that you can give a product with packaging back without providing a reason.</sub></p>
","<p>Two options you can try:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Go to the store and ask them to refund the difference.  They might not, but it doesn't hurt to ask.  Often stores will do this if you are within the return window because it saves them some hassle over you returning the used item and then buying a new item at the lower price.</p></li>
<li><p>Buy the identical item again at the new price, then return it using the old receipt.</p></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>I do not recommend any cheating or fraud.  Please let me explain further what you might do.</p>

<p>First, attempt #1 above.  It is very common for stores to give you a refund shortly after the purchase.  Why?  Because this is an easier and better option for everyone than any of the other options.  The store wants to keep its customers happy; that is why it has the generous return policy in the first place.</p>

<p>If the store employee doesn't go for this, (perhaps he doesn't know how to properly enter this into the register), tell him that you would like to buy the item today at the new price and return it at the old price with your old receipt.  This may not have occurred to the employee as an option, and it might help the employee figure out how to enter this transaction and give you your refund.  </p>

<p>If the store employee doesn't like this, tell him that you are planning on purchasing the new item today and returning the old item tomorrow.  At this point, the store employee might realize that the store is better off keeping their new item on the shelf than they are exchanging a new item for a used item, and allow you to do the second option right there.</p>

<p>It's possible that they won't go for this either.  Now, if you purchase the new item, you'll have a decision to make.  You need to return one of the items with packaging using one of the receipts.</p>

<p>If the store is logging serial numbers on the receipt, it may not be an option to return the new item with the old receipt.  If the receipt does not contain the serial number, I would argue that there is no fraud or cheating going on by returning the new item with the old receipt.  If the receipt does contain the serial number but the packaging does not, then you should be able to use the new packaging to return the old item.</p>

<p>In candlestick charts for example, if you get what is called a Bearish Engulfing Candle (where the open is higher than the previous day's close and the close is lower than the previous day's open) at the top of an uptrend, this could mean that the top may have been reached and the bears are taking over the bulls.</p>

<p>A Bearish Engulfing candle is seen as a bearish reversal pattern, as the bulls start the day by opening the stock at a higher price than yesterday's close, but by the end of the day the bears have taken over as the price drops below yesterday's open. This reversal pattern can be even more pronounced and effective if it coincides with other chart indicators, such as an overbought momentum indicator.</p>

","<p>Lenders may sell your mortgage to other lenders for a fee.  For example,  your lender might sell your mortgage to the highest bidder who may want to purchase your mortgage by making a one time payment.  For your lender that's a quick profit, for the new owner of your mortgage, that's long term returns for a one time fee. </p>

"What US law requires a bank to reopen a closed account if a third party sends money to it?","8582","","<p>I used to have an account with a local credit union. I moved, then closed the account. The credit union mailed me a check for my remaining balance and confirmed the account was closed. This was 14 months ago.</p>

<p>Last week, someone tried to send me money via popmoney to that account. The credit union reopened the account and deposited the money. If the credit union had not started emailing me promotional junk immediately after reopening the account, I would never had known I was sent any money or that the account was reopened. In fact I only learned as much because I tried to log in to their online banking to opt out of the junk mail, and noticed to my surprise that not only could I still log in, but I had an open account with a balance.</p>

<p>I asked the bank why my account was active and the popmoney was not rejected as I expected it should be, and they told me</p>

  <p>Any time there is a deposit request  for a account that has been

  funds.</p>

<p>What law are they referring to and what's the reason for it?</p>

<p>In my case, if it weren't for the junk mail I could easily have never found out about it. What good does closing an account do if any third party can reopen it by trying to deposit money to it? Is there a better way to completely destroy an account that I should ask for next time to prevent this from recurring?</p>
","<p>There is no Federal law that mandates that they must re-open a closed account. They can either refuse the transfer / return the money, or they can optionally re-open your account so they get money (makes more sense for them). It is, however, in one of your agreements that they reserve the right to re-open a closed account in order to receive the deposit. At which point, your account will become active, and the balance may be below the required minimum balance threshold, so you may have maintenance or low-balance fees charged against the account (Credit Unions are less likely to have these fees).</p>

<p>If you want to call them out on their BS, you can ask them to cite the law which mandates the re-opening of closed accounts. They will likely fall back on your Member agreement. There <strong>may</strong> be some state laws that discuss this, but I haven't found anything.</p>

<p>This has become such a problem for some bank customers (where they are charged fees on the money they weren't aware they had) that a law was proposed in Sept. 2013, called the <a href=""https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr3137"" rel=""nofollow"">Freedom and Mobility in Consumer Banking Act</a>, which would essentially only allow the named account holder(s) to re-open a closed account.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No - your profit will be the rents that you collect (minus expenses). You still have an <em>asset</em> that is worth roughly what you paid for it (and might go up in value), so you don't need to recoup the <em>entire</em> cost of the property before making a profit.</p>

<p>From my understanding, most lenders don't separately track ""interest owed"" and ""principal owed"" - they just track the total amount you owe. Even if they did, it wouldn't make a difference whether you paid down the interest account or the principal account, because the total amount you owe (and the total amount of interest you'll have to pay on it) will still be the same.</p>

<p>Why do people say to make sure your payments are applied towards the principal?</p>
","<p>Many lenders in the US  do permit additional payments to be made against the principal. Those will reduce how much you actually owe, which reduces the total interest you will owe over the duration of the loan as well as shortening its duration. It is not uncommon for people to take a 30 year mortgage so they have the option of paying slowly, but to make the additional payments to shorten it to 20 or 15 years... at a total cost not too much more than the shorter loan would have cost.</p>

<p>Not all lenders/loans will let you do this. If yours doesn't, your only option to reduce total cost of the loan is to refinance.</p>

<p>Note that you may need to explicitly say you want the extra applied to principal, or they may count it as just prepaying future installment payments the loan.</p>

<p>and the guy said (at 34 min): If an option has a delta of 34, it has a 34% probability of expiring in the money? Is it possible to understand it intuitively without getting into the math of Black Scholes formula?</p>
","<p>Just for clarification, delta and probability of expiring in the money are <em>not</em> the same thing. What the guy meant was that delta is usually a close enough approximation to the probability.</p>

<p>One way to think about it is to look at the probabilities and deltas of In the Money, Out of the Money, and At the Money options.</p>

<ul>
<li>A deep in the money option has a really high chance of expiring in the money, around 100%, and it has about 100 delta</li>
<li>A far out of the money option has a really low chance of expiring in the money, around 0%,  and it has about 0 delta</li>
<li>An at the money option has about 50% probability of being in the money because there is a 50-50 chance the stock will go up or down, and it has about 50 delta</li>
</ul>

<p>In these cases, the delta and probabilities are about the same. In fact if you look at an options chain with delta and probabilities, you can see that they are all about the same. In other words, there is a linear relationship between delta and probability.</p>

"What is the purpose of property tax?","8522","","<p>I currently rent, but have been looking to buy a home. I always imagined how great it would be to have a dream home, worth, say, $500K, and to have it fully paid off. My thought was the only recurring fee I would have to pay is for utilities to keep the home running.</p>

<p>Then I learned about property tax. It looks like for a $500K home, annual property tax can be anywhere from $3-7K (~$500/month).</p>

<p>What if someone has no income and isn't able to cover the tax? What is the purpose of it? The idea of having to pay a recurring fee on land bought and paid for makes me really uncomfortable. Maybe someone can share some insight to put me at ease?</p>
","<p>Property taxes, where they exist, are generally levied by cities, counties and other local-level administrative bodies like MUDs, and are the primary source of revenue at these levels of government. These taxes pay the lion's share of the expenses for basic services provided by a city or county:</p>

<ul>
<li>Local road maintenance/signs/lights</li>
<li>Utilities infrastructure (water/wastewater/trash are typically city-administered; electrical and telecom it handled more directly by providers but government has a hand in it)</li>
<li>Local first responders (police/fire/EMS)</li>
<li>Local government offices (courts, county clerk, commissioner, animal control)</li>
<li>Mass transit subsidies (lowers the ticket price to encourage ridership by making everyone pay a little from their other taxes whether they ride or not)</li>
<li>Municipal facilities (parks, pools, etc)</li>
<li>Public schools and interscholastic facilities (teachers' salaries, building maintenance/upkeep, administration, athletic facilities)</li>
</ul>

<p>There are federal dollars, other revenue sources (State lottery revenues often go toward public schools for instance), and ""usage fees"" (vehicle registration, utility bills, toll roads) at play as well, but a lot of that money covers larger-scale infrastructure development (freeways/interstates) and specialized ""earmarks"" (political backscratching involving this bridge or that dam in a Congresscritter's home district, a few national initiatives from the President's budget like first-responder technology upgrades for improved disaster/terrorism readiness). Property taxes are the main funding for the day-to-day government operations at the most visible level to the average resident.</p>

<p>The theory behind using a property tax instead of some other form of taxation (like income) is that the value of the property and the quality of services provided to the resident(s) of that property are interrelated; the property is valuable in part because the infrastructure is well-maintained and nearby schools/hospitals are good, and by the same token, affluent residents expect high-quality services. Property taxes are also easier to levy, because most of the work can be done by the tax assessor; monitor recent sale prices, do drive-bys through neighborhoods, come up with a number and send the resident the bill. That's opposed to sales taxes which businesses operating in the jurisdiction have to calculate, collect and turn over, or income taxes which require residents to fill out paperwork to calculate how much they owe.</p>

<p>The justification is eminent domain. It's very simple; when you buy land in the U.S. and a State thereof, you are still a citizen and/or resident of that State and the U.S., and subject to their laws. You're not creating your own country when you buy a house. As such, the government charges you for the facilities and services they provide in your area and your State, which are then your privilege to use. Obviously roads aren't free; a one-mile stretch behind my house is costing the county $15 million to expand it from 2-lane to 4-lane.</p>

<p>Here's the kicker; you've already been paying these taxes. You think your landlord's just going to take the property taxes for the whole apartment complex on the chin? He's out to make money, and doing that requires charging a sufficient amount to cover costs, including taxes he incurs. You just never see ""allocated property taxes"" as an item on your rent statement, just like you don't see ""allocated landowner mortgage"", ""allocated facilities maintenance"", ""allocated gross margin"" etc. You know you're getting shafted, paying someone else's financing with a little extra on the side to boot. That's why you want a house.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, not being able to pay these taxes is a grim reality for some people, old and young, and government generally doesn't go easy on delinquent homeowners. After medical bills and mortgage delinquency, property tax delinquency is the number three reason for bankruptcy, and only a mortgage or property tax delinquency can cause your home to be seized and sold. Well that and using it for criminal enterprise, but unless you're running a meth lab in your half-million-dollar home or financing it with coke money I wouldn't worry about that score. Retirement planners figure property taxes into cost of living, and they do often advise a downgrade from the 2-story house you raised your children in to something smaller (for many reasons, including lower taxes).</p>

<p>There really isn't a way to structure a completely ""pay-as-you-go"" metropolitan area, and you wouldn't want to live in it if there were. Imagine every strip of asphalt in the county being a toll road where your transponder (TollTag, EZ-Pass, etc) or license plate was scanned and you were billed at each intersection. In addition to being a huge invasion of privacy, the cost to maintain this network (and your cost to use it) would skyrocket. Imagine 911 asking for a credit card number before dispatching police, fire or EMS (Ambulance services already do bill on a per-event basis, but you'd be surprised how few people pay and how little power a county EMS has to enforce collection; without a property tax and Medicaid to cover the difference, EMS service could not be provided in most counties).</p>

"Are services provided to Google employees taxed as income or in any way?","8516","","<p>The particular service I want to look at is food (though I think the same ideas should apply to all services). So Let's say that a Google employee spends a dollar on food, purchasing groceries. They got that dollar through working for Google, and their income is taxed, so lets say getting that dollar required $1.3 in income. But if Google bought the groceries for them (I'm aware this isn't how Google's food is provided), it would require only $1 in expenditure from the company. The missing $0.3 in income tax would simply disappear. I believe this is how healthcare for employees works as well.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is this right?</p></li>
<li><p>If it is, why is it that extensive services are provided by high margin companies competing for talent, rather then lower margin businesses looking to boost their profits by reducing their expenditures on employees (by cutting out the government)?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>For example, suppose John Doe makes $100,000 a year taxed at a rate of 20%, for a take home pay of $80,000. He spends $10,000 on food. His employer Corporation decides to give him all of his food and deduct it as a business expense - costing them $10,000. But now they can pay John Doe an amount so his take home pay will be reduced by $10,000 - $87,500 The company is now spending $97500 employing John Doe, for a savings of $2500$. </p>

<p>The lower the margins of the business and the more (in percentage of fixed costs) the company spends on employees, the greater the increase in profits these savings enable.</p>
","<p>Most of this is already regulated. ""Food"" specifically is exempt from taxes if it's done on premise and for the ""convenience of the employer"", whatever that means.

The equity you're trying to increase is the entire right hand side, and in GnuCash this is usually done by increasing your income.  GnuCash will keep track of your overall equity on its own.</p>

"Why was my Credit Limit Increase Denied?","8494","","<p>I applied for a credit line increase from Capital One a few weeks ago.  A few days ago I got a letter indicated that the increase request was rejected.  The two reasons stated were:</p>

<ul>
<li>Primary cardholder current accounts not used enough</li>
<li>Primary cardholder insufficient experience with high lines of credit on Capital One Accounts</li>
</ul>

<p>I have two cards with Capital One, both with roughly the same limit.  That limit is about 10% of my (household) annual income--about 5% each.  I have one other major card, an American Express, which adds roughly another 2.5% of my annual income.</p>

<p>I use one of the cards for everything I possibly can, as it has the better rewards.  I pay it off in full each billing cycle.  I pay off the other cards in full each month, but I only use them for specific purchases (e.g. Costco only accepts Amex, some old subscriptions still charge to my other Capital One card).</p>

<p>My Equifax credit score is 813 (per the letter).</p>

<p>Needless to say, I was surprised to get this rejection letter.  I have excellent credit, no revolving debt and a low (I think) ratio of credit limit to income.  I also use my credit card a lot, regardless of the first bullet point above.</p>

<p>Does the company dislike customers who don't pay any interest or fees?  Or is 12.5% of income a fairly standard credit limit across all cards?</p>
","<p>I think they gave you the answer: You haven't previously shown that you can run that particular card up to (near) its existing maximum and then pay it off, so they don't have a strong indication that you can handle that large an unsecured loan. Generally, requests to have the limits raised when there isn't evidence that the customer is finding the current limit inconvenient are going to be considered suspicious.</p>

<p>Remember, a great credit rating does not <em>require</em> that they consider you a good risk -- it's just one of the things they consider.</p>

<p>Why do you need the limit raised? Have you tried contacting the bank's credit department directly and discussing what they will or won't let you do?</p>

<p>Re paying off the card every month: Remember, they do get a processing fee from the vendor. They'd prefer that we paid interest (I'm told the term of art for those of us who don't is ""deadbeats""), but they certainly don't lose money when we don't. And they'd generally rather have us be loyal customers who MIGHT someday pay interest, and who are bringing in fees, than have us go elsewhere.</p>

"In the USA, why is the Free File software only available for people earning less than $62k?","8437","","<p><a href=""https://www.irs.gov/uac/Free-File:-Do-Your-Federal-Taxes-for-Free"">Free File</a> is a software by the American IRS, which allows one to easily fill out their taxes as long as they earn less than $62k per year. Is there a particular reason for such a restriction?</p>

<p>I assume that the government generally wants its citizens to pay what they're due, so why exclude people from the middle and upper class?</p>
","<p>It is very helpful to understand that Free File is not actually ""by"" the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The IRS does indeed offer access to the program through their website, but Free File is actually a public-private partnership program operated and maintained by the <a href=""http://freefilealliance.org/faqs"">Free File Alliance</a>. Who is the Free File Alliance? Well, according to their <a href=""http://freefilealliance.org/free-file-alliance-members/"">members list</a>: 1040NOW Corp., Drake Enterprises, ezTaxReturn.com, FileYourTaxes, Free Tax Returns, H&amp;R Block, Intuit, Jackson Hewitt, Liberty Tax, OnLine Taxes, TaxACT, TaxHawk, and TaxSlayer.</p>

<p>Why the income restriction? Well, that's part of the deal the IRS struck - <a href=""http://freefilealliance.org/about/"">the program is</a> ""dedicated to helping 70 percent of American taxpayers prepare and e-file their federal tax returns"". Technically the member companies are offering their own software to handle tax preparation, and the rule is that 70% of American's must 'qualify' for at least one product, so this adjusted gross income limit changes periodically so that 70% of the population can use it.</p>

<p>Why restrict it at all? This was part of the give and take involved in negotiation with the businesses involved. If the program was ""everyone files for free"", then it is presumed that many reputable businesses that make the program valuable would choose not to continue to participate. In other words, they want to be able to not give away their services for free to customers who are - at least by income definition - more than capable of paying them. The IRS has said it does not want to be in the tax prep software business, so they are not offering their own free software to do the job that private companies would otherwise charge for.</p>

<p>However, there are other restrictions to being in the program - like the fact that no business in the program can offer ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refund_anticipation_loan"">refund anticipation loans</a>"", offer commercial services more than a certain amount of times (so they can't hound you to upgrade), and so on. Some businesses were making a killing off these, though they are pretty much solely developed to be predatory on people with the lowest incomes (and education levels, and IQ, and with cognitive disabilities, and basically anyone they could sucker into paying what were effectively absurd rates for short term loans along with inflated filing/preparation fees).</p>

<p>Finally, Free File was partly developed as an initiative to increase the amount of digitally filed taxes and reduce the paper-based burdens of accepting and processing turns. In other words: to cut government costs, not to be a government welfare program. Even if it were, one can generally obtain commercial software for $30-$100, so the benefit to those above gross income levels is pretty minor; yearly costs to file taxes with such software for those payers would be less than 0.001% of their yearly expenses. Compared to the benefits obtainable by households living below the poverty line, fighting to cover an extra 5-30% of the population at the potential expense of having the whole program be a failure probably seemed like a more than worthwhile trade-off.</p>

</ul>
","<p>Usually their PE ratio will just be listed as 0 or blank.  Though I've always wondered why they don't just list the negative PE as from a straight math standpoint it makes sense.</p>

<p>PE while it can be a useful barometer for a company, but certainly does not tell you everything.  A company could have negative earnings for a lot of reasons, some good and some bad.  The company could just be a bad company and could be losing money hand over fist, or the company could have had a one time occurrence such as a big acquisition or some other event that just affected this years earnings, or they could be an awesome high growth company that is heavily investing for their future and forgoing locking in profits now for much bigger profits in the future.</p>

<p>Generally IPO company's fall into that last category as they are going public usually because they want an influx of cash that they are going to use to grow the company much more rapidly.  So they are likely already taking all incoming $$ and taking on debt to grow the company and have exceeded all of those options and that's when they turn to the stock market for the additional influx of cash, so it is very common for these companies not to have earnings.   Now you just have to decide if that company is investing that money wisely and will in the future translate to actual earnings.</p>

"What exactly are minimum subsequent investment requirements?","8399","","<p>I was looking at some mutual funds that list amounts for ""initial"" and ""subsequent"" investments under the ""minimum investment"" category.  At first I thought that the ""subsequent"" requirement meant that you had to invest at least that much every year or month.  I looked around online to try to find a good explanation of what it was, but couldn't find anything that directly explained it.  However, I'm inferring from what I read that it simply means that if you ever do invest more money in the fund, they want you to do it in chunks at least that large (presumably so they don't have to process tons of small transactions).  Is this correct?</p>
","<p>It costs money for a mutual fund to accept your money. It doesn't cost as much as it used to, but historically there has been, at a minimum, a modicum of record-keeping associated with it. As such, they will typically have a minimum amount of money they want you to add at a time. They don't want to process 100 transfers of a nickel each; that would be silly.</p>

<p>So if you have a mutual fund with a ""minimum initial investment"" of $10,000 and a ""minimum subsequent investment"" of $100, then that means that you can put in $10k to open it, and then deposit dollars in lots of 100 or more whenever you feel like it.</p>

","<p>Since the deposits into the investment fund are irregular in their timing, there isn't really any single formula that will give the information you want.  Your only hope is a spreadsheet.</p>

<p>Start by guessing at the rate of return.   Yes, GUESS.  Assume that the rate is the annual rate, compounded monthly.</p>

<p>So, you throw in the $1200; it grows, compounded, for 8 months, and then you throw in another $8300.  The new total grows at that same rate monthly until the next payment, and so on.  In the end, you'll have the current value of the investments, assuming that the interest rate guess is correct. (Not too likely!)</p>

<p>This screen clip

<p>The Error is the difference between the calculated value and the actual value;  4% is too low a guess. Since the investment is actually worth more, you need to hike the interest rate and try again.  Eventually you'll zero in on the correct rate...</p>

<p>Fortunately, most spreadsheets have a ""What-If"" function.  In Excel, you can tell the program to fiddle with one cell until another cell has the value you want.  When I do this, this is what I get:

","<p>If you have $10000 and wish to buy 1000 shares of a $10 stock, you risk borrowing on margin if you go over a bit.</p>

"Is it a bad idea to have 3 secured credit card accounts open?","8377","","<p>I initially signed up for a Wells Fargo cash secured credit card, last month, but lately with their changing the ToS and extra fee, I am worried about my choice.</p>

<p>People have asked me not to close that recently opened card just now, because it might affect my history in a very negative way, but recommended that I join some CUs.</p>

<p>I am thinking of getting cash secured credit card from DCU and CUSocal but am thinking - Is it a bad idea to have 3 secured credit card accounts open?</p>

<p>The CU's cash secured credit cards have no annual fee, so unless I am missing something, it should not harm my history just to keep it open (and keep them at ~20% utilization).</p>

<p>I am doing this because there is a risk that I might need to close the Wells Fargo cash secured credit card by year end.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>Let me rephrase my question and put in some numbers:</p>

<p>a. My gross income, as a part-time on-campus worker on an hourly wage, will not likely exceed $1k/month</p>

<p>This does not include the federal tax and other associated taxes I need to pay (would reduce my net pay)</p>

<p>b. If I open up two new cards, I will likely keep a credit limit of $500 on them</p>

<p>This means, then, I have the WF $1k card and two new $500 cards</p>

<p>Now:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>My understanding is that having multiple credit accounts with low
credit lines is better than having fewer credit accounts with higher
credit line. In other words, my understanding is</p>

<ul>
<li>3 cards with a $500 credit line: Good</li>
<li>1 card with a $1500 credit line: Not (so) Good</li>
</ul>

<p>I would like to have a thicker credit report than a thin one, and
perhaps having accounts with multiple lenders is a better way of
doing that?</p>

<p>I think 1 is too less but perhaps 3 is too much and 2 accounts would be sufficient to have a  ""thicker credit report"", or is this ""thin"" and thick credit report all BS </p></li>
<li><p>How is the Debt-to-income ratio calculated?</p>

<p>Is the 'income' my net pay after taxes or gross income, before all

<ul>
<li>Is it the ratio of the oustanding balances you have on your credit
accounts to your income</li>
</ul>

<p>or</p>

<ul>
<li>Is it the ratio of the sum of credit line you have on your credit
accounts to your income</li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, with an income of $1k a month and a balance of $300
on all my credit accounts, would my debt-to-income ratio be:</p>

<ul>
<li>i. 300/1000 (oustanding balance/income) = 0.3</li>
</ul>

<p>or</p>

<ul>
<li>ii. 1500/1000 (sum of credit line/income) = 1.5</li>

<li><p>get a good rate on a loan for a new car</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I am not thinking about mortgage or anything that long term at all.</p>
","<p>I think you should stop for a second and think about what you're trying to achieve.</p>

<p>What do you need the secured cards for? What are you changing the banks for?</p>

<p>If its just because of the fees on the WF checking account - just close that account, its not tied to your secured card in any way (regardless of what the representatives might say, they're paid to make you open more accounts). I had a secured card with WF, and closed my checking account there, and had no problem with the secured card working for another year. When they had to return my deposit - they just mailed me a check.</p>

<p>If you think you need more credit limit - just add to the deposit you already have at WF and ask them to raise the limit.</p>

<p>If you <strong>need</strong> 3 credit cards - then, and only then, it will make sense to have 3 credit cards.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT after your re-editing the question</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My understanding is that having multiple credit accounts with low
  credit lines is better than having fewer credit accounts with higher
  credit line.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not really. With revolving accounts, what matters is the credit to debt ratio. I.e.: how much of the credit available to you is actually utilized. Also, the age of the accounts (the length of the history) is important. The number of accounts is less critical, and can have negative influence if you have too many of them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How is the Debt-to-income ratio calculated?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's not. Income doesn't appear on your credit report. The ratio that is influencing the credit score is debt-to-<strong>credit</strong>. I.e.: how much of the available credit line is utilized (aggregated for all the accounts).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>get an unsecured card with a good rate and nice features in a year</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Usually a secured card will become unsecured automatically after ~1 year in good standing. You shouldn't care about the rate, it's an irrelevant number (unless you're going to accumulate credit card debt, but then again, you seem to be smarter than that), features you will be getting a bit later (although after 1 year you might start getting offers for decent cash-back cards).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>not face issues renting an apartment near work (I had to put down 3
  months rent as deposit with the landlord)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Length of the history is more important here than the number of accounts. Closing one and opening another will actually do more damage then good, because you'll shorten the available history. Also, the previous references play a big role here, as the employment status.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>be qualified for a postpaid wireless/cellular plan (all I am eligible for
  now are prepaid plans)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, length of the history. Once you've got a 1yr worth of history - you won't have issues here.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>get a good rate on a loan for a new car</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Debt-credit ratio, length of the history, and the income. With 1K a month - don't get your hopes high, regardless of how many credit cards you have.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PpWZt.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Let's say I invest in it right now, would I get my initial investment back PLUS the 6.25% coupon interest rate by 15 April 2015? </p>
","<p>There are a few things you need to keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>the coupon is based on the par value of 100 but the bond is currently trading at 102.  At 102 the yield to maturity is 2.5%, not 6.25%</li>
<li>the coupon and yield to maturity are annual rates, so over a holding period of ca. 6 months you are only going to make half that, i.e. 1.2%</li>
<li>and, most importantly, you will only make that return if the company does not default by April 2015 and pays the last coupon and repays the notional as expected. That is not a 100% probability (otherwise the bond would trade at a higher price/lower yield to reflect the lower risk).</li>
</ul>

<p>By buying a short term bond, you significantly reduce your exposure to interest rate moves, but your credit risk (the risk that the issuer may default on its payments) is still there.</p>

<p>So to answer your question no, it is not a zero risk investment, although it is very low in this case (the probability of the Australian government to default is low).</p>

<hr>

<p>Regarding the first bullet point, I took the figures from Bloomberg but I can give you a simplified example that outlines the principle (in practice you need to take the ex-coupon date and settlement date on your trade into account to run an exact calculation).</p>

<p>The bond pays a coupon of $3.125 every 6 months. The half yearly coupon has just been paid (on October 15th) and there is approximately 6 months left in the bond. If the issuer does not default you will receive 100 + 6.25/2 at maturity or 103.125.</p>

<p>If you buy the bond at par ($100), you would make a return of 3.125% over 6 months, or ~6.25% per annum, as you expect. But if you buy the bond at $102 (current price), you will only make a little more than 1% over the 6-month period.</p>

"Saving for retirement: How much is enough?","8319","","<p><strong>How to save</strong><br>
I'm in my late twenties and am trying to get started off on the right foot saving for retirement. I have learned that retirement savings should usually be placed in retirement accounts in the following order:</p>

<ol>
<li>Roth 401(k) - Just enough to get the maximum company match. (if available) </li>
<li>Roth IRA - Up to the annual max. ($5k per person for 2010/2011) </li>
<li>Spouse's Roth IRA - Up to the annual max. ($5k per person for 2010/2011) </li>
<li>Roth 401(k) - The rest of the way up to the annual max. ($16.5k per person for 2010)</li>
</ol>

<p>(Please let me know if you disagree.) My understanding is that the 401(k) and IRA limits are independent, so I can put $5k into my Roth IRA, $5k into my wife's, $16.5k into my Roth 401(k), and $16.5k into my wife's Roth 401(k) if she had one. I can't imagine wanting to save more for retirement than that. </p>

<p><strong>How to calculate ""the number""</strong><br>
But that brings me to my real question: How much do I need to save for retirement? I have other financial goals like saving for a house down payment that need attention. So I tried to sit down and calculate ""my number"" ... how much money I will need to retire ""comfortably."" I'm pretty handy with a spreadsheet for this kind of stuff, but there are just so many factors that by the time I'm done with my calculation I'm not even sure if it's accurate. </p>

<p>So here is what I did. Please help me understand how I can tweak the calculation and/or where there is a <em>good</em> online tool.</p>

<p>My strategy was to first calculate how much money I would have at retirement if I contributed $5000 to a Roth IRA every year until retirement. I assumed a 10-11% average yield. Of course it varies greatly depending on how long I wait to retire. This is where the first problem comes in, because when I retire might depend on how much money is in my retirement accounts. That's no biggie because my spreadsheet lets me see the estimated balance for every year, so I can evaluate my options. The second problem so far is that I haven't factored for inflation: How will contribution limits rise? How much will my money be worth in today's dollars?</p>

<p>My next step was to calculate how long that money will last. For this I assumed an investment yield of 3-5%. (Lower yield since I will invest conservatively during retirement.) I gave myself a salary and subtracted the salary every year until all the money was gone. I also assumed a 3% inflation rate, so I gave myself a 3% raise every year.</p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong><br>
So for example, if I start investing at 27, get a 10% yield, and retire at 65 I will have $2,116,952. Then if I get a 3% yield and give myself a 3% raise with a $70k starting salary, my money will last until I am 96. Not bad. </p>

<p>Based on this it sounds like if my wife and I max out our Roth IRAs and put enough into our 401(k)s to get the company match then we'll be more than fine. But what about inflation? Is $70k enough of a salary? (Of course it would be $140k if my wife did the same.)</p>

<p>Should I increase the annual contribution somehow? Should I use different estimated yields? Am I just <em>way</em> off?</p>
","<p>I'd encourage you to use rules of thumb and back-of-the-envelope. Here are some ideas that could be useful:</p>

<ul>
<li>save at least 10% of your income, but 15% is better. Your savings rate will need to cover everything (retirement, emergencies, houses, cars, kids) and 10% probably isn't good enough for that.</li>
<li>you might withdraw 4% per year in retirement, which implies you might want to reach 25x of whatever you would live on in your 50s... if you save half your income, you don't need to plan to spend 80% of your income in retirement, right? (be sure to keep pretax/post-tax equivalent when calculating this, i.e. either gross or net income on both ends) (also, 4% assumes ""spending down"" a bit rather than living only on principal, I believe)</li>
<li>save an emergency fund first, before anything else</li>
<li>retirement or home downpayment first is sort of a personal call, in my opinion. how soon do you want to own a house?</li>
<li>you can always stop saving in retirement-restricted accounts if you get ""enough"" in there, and the earlier you save the more you benefit from compounding</li>
<li>6-7% is a much safer investment return expectation than 10% (10% might be OK if you're talking nominal and not real, but I think it's easier to just use real returns instead of picking a nominal and an inflation assumption separately)</li>
<li>when you get a raise, divert at least part of it to auto-deposited savings so you don't inflate your lifestyle</li>
<li>for most of us, our time is almost certainly better spent thinking about our income and career than in detailed investment planning - if you do the math, assuming you save 10-15% of whatever you make, then boosting your income 20k is worth a whole lot of money over the years. Of course if you save 0% or something close to it, then you can make a million a year and still be screwed.</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem with any kind of detailed calculations is the number of unknowns:</p>

<ul>
<li>your income and career</li>
<li>emergencies you will face, whether lawsuits or ill health or children</li>
<li>future government policy, for example will you get Medicare / Social Security and how much, tax rates, etc.</li>
<li>real investment returns</li>
<li>""glide path"" of your investment returns (depression right before retirement or bubble right before retirement, for example)</li>
<li>if you panic in a downturn and ""go to cash"" even once, or speculate in a bubble even once, you can <em>completely destroy</em> any calculations and assumptions you might have had...</li>
</ul>

<p>There are some really complex calculators out there, for example see ESPlanner (<a href=""http://www.esplanner.com/"">http://www.esplanner.com/</a>) (caution: horrible user interface, but seemed to work), that will include all kinds of factors and run monte carlo and the whole thing. But in my opinion, it's just as good or better to say save at least 15% of income until you have 25x what you spend, or some other such rule of thumb.</p>

<p>Here's my little blog post on savings and investing fwiw: <a href=""http://blog.ometer.com/2010/11/10/take-risks-in-life-for-savings-choose-a-balanced-fund/"">http://blog.ometer.com/2010/11/10/take-risks-in-life-for-savings-choose-a-balanced-fund/</a></p>

<p>Another note, there's sort of an ""ideology of how to live"" embedded in any retirement recommendation, and you might want to take the time to reflect on that and consciously choose. A book on this topic is Your Money or Your Life by Robin &amp; Dominguez, <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0143115766"">http://www.amazon.com/Your-Money-Life-Transforming-Relationship/dp/0143115766</a> which is a sort of radical ""you should save everything possible to achieve financial independence as early as possible"" argument. I didn't go for their plan, but I think it's thought-provoking. A newer book that may be more appealing is called <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0743270320"">The Number</a>  and it's about your question exactly. It's more designed to get you thinking, while Your Money or Your Life has a particular answer in mind. Both have some math and some rules of thumb, though they aren't focused on that.</p>

<p>A kind of general takeaway from these books might be: first think about your <em>expenses</em>. What are you trying to accomplish in life, how would you like to spend your time? And then ask how much money you absolutely need to accomplish that, and focus on accomplishing your goals, spending your time (as much as you can) on what you'd like to spend it on.</p>

<p>I'm contrasting this with a generic recommendation to save enough to spend 80% of your income in retirement, which embeds this idea that you should spend as much as possible every year, before and after you retire. Lots of people do like that idea, but it's not a law of the universe or something, it's just one popular approach.</p>

"What effect would currency devaluation have on my investments?","8314","","<p>I am curious what effect currency devaluation has on the value of my various investments/assets.</p>

<p>For instance, I have retirement savings in mutual funds, growth stocks, and bonds.
First, let's consider mutual funds that do not contain government bond shares.
It seems to me that these assets should be relatively immune to currency devaluation, because I own a number of shares of different companies, rather than an amount of dollars.
Thus, if the companies whose stocks I have shares of have invested wisely, the stocks' real values would stay relatively the same (and value would increase with respect to the currency), while government bond assets' real values would decrease.</p>

<p>Now, my gut tells me that this is probably incorrect.
Can somebody clarify this for me?
I want to know if I need to be making sure my investments span multiple currencies to protect against a single country's currency failing.</p>

<p>I would ask the same question about my home's value against a devalued currency as well.
Would it keep the same real value.</p>

<p>Now, I'm mainly wanting to get a picture of the affect the currency devaluation has on the values.
I know that there could be some downstream effects where the economy suffers such that the demand for housing goes down, causing decreased value.
If you have simple examples of those downstream effects that would be great, but I'm mainly curious about the immediate effects of the currency devaluation itself.</p>

<hr>

<p>UPDATED QUESTION SUMMARY:
I'm really interested in what happens when a currency quickly devalues. 
For example, treasury bonds are tied to the currency, so the real value would exactly follow the devaluation.
On the other hand, a commodity, like gold, is not tied to the value of any currency.
Thus, it is theoretically <em>immune</em> to the devaluation and its real value would remain constant.</p>

<p>My question boiled down:
Do stock mutual funds behave more like treasury bonds or commodities?
When I think about it, it seems that they should respond the devaluation like a commodity.
I own a quantity of company shares (not tied to a currency), and let's assume that the company only holds <em>immune</em> assets.
Does the real value of my stock ownership go down? Why?</p>

<p>Please don't over-complicate the question, arguing about how nothing is truly immune or stable.</p>
","<p>Stocks, gold, commodities, and physical real estate will not be affected by currency changes, regardless of whether those changes are fast or slow.  All bonds except those that are indexed to inflation will be demolished by sudden, unexpected devaluation.</p>

<p>Notice: The above is true if devaluation is the <strong>only</strong> thing going on but this will not be the case.  Unfortunately, if the currency devalued rapidly it would be because something else is happening in the economy or government.  How these asset values are affected by that other thing would depend on what the other thing is.  In other words, you must tell us what you think will cause devaluation, then we can guess how it might affect stock, real estate, and commodity prices.</p>

"Why does a stock's price fluctuate so often, even when fresh news isn't available?","8308","","<p>I get it that the price of a stock goes up and down as fresh news is released, positive or negative.</p>

<p>However, fresh news is released only at certain times while the price of a stock changes (by minute amounts) almost every second.</p>

<p>What is the cause for the price to fluctuate minute to minute without the input of any fresh news?</p>
","<p>News about a company is not the only thing that affects its stock's price.</p>

<p>There is also supply and demand.  That, of course, is influenced by news, but it is not the only actor.  An insider, with a large position in their company's stock, may want to diversify his overall portfolio and thus need to sell a large amount of stock.  That may be significant enough to increase supply and likely reduce the stock's price somewhat.</p>

<p>That brings me to another influence on stock price: perception.  Executives, and other insiders with large positions in their company's stock, have to be careful about how and when they sell some of that stock as to not worry the markets.  Many investors watch insider selling to gauge the health of the company.</p>

<p>Which brings me to another important point.  There are many things that may be considered news which is material to a certain company and its stock.  It is not just quarterly filings, earnings reports and such.  There is also news related to competitors, news about the economy or a certain sector, news about some weather event that affects a major supplier, news about a major earthquake that will impact the economy of a nation which can then have knock-on effects to other economies, etc...</p>

<p>There are also a lot of investors with varying needs which will influence supply and demand.  An institutional investor, needing to diversify, may reduce their position in a stock and thus increase supply enough that it impacts the stock's price.  Meanwhile, individual investors will make their transactions at varying times during the day.  In the aggregate, that may have significant impacts on supply and demand.</p>

<p>The overall point being that there are a lot of inputs and a lot of actors in a complicated system.  Even if you focus just on news, there are many things that fall into that category. News does not come out at regular intervals and it does not necessarily spread evenly.  That alone could make for a highly variable environment.</p>

I'm at a loss about how to start such a thing, however, and how to maximize its potential.</p>

<p>As I understand it, infinite banking requires whole life insurance to be truly successful, due to the nature of how a whole life insurance policy works. Whole life provides both a term policy as well as a dividends-paying investment. If my understanding is correct, when properly capitalized, you can eventually reach a point where the dividends cover the policy premium, and the account becomes fully self sustaining (not entirely sure about this one...seems the dividends payout is not guaranteed, so if someone understands this part better, I'd be grateful for more insight)? Once you have fully capitalized your policy and it does become self sustaining, you are then able to take loans out up to the cash value of the account, and all principal and interest payments go back into the policy, rather than into some random third party bank. I really love that concept, however I'm not really sure where to start.</p>

<p>My question is, how would I go about actually setting up such an account? For all the individuals and institutions that ""rave"" about this, they do come off as a bit scammish, and I don't want to work with someone who isn't giving me all of the details. Or, if I have to work with such a person, I would rather fully understand what they are trying to sell me, so I can make the decision to bug out if they sound like they are trying to pull a fast one.</p>

<p>Is it possible to do this with any whole life policy, or is it more specialized than that (based on what I've read and heard, it sounds more specialized.) If I am able to start such a policy, how would I go about maximizing its potential? I'm a 30 year old male, currently single, so finding some cash to capitalize with wouldn't be a huge problem. I don't make a ton of money, but more than enough to live comfortably on. </p>
","<p>Can't tell you where to go for a good policy, but I can tell you that most brokers make a hefty commission out of your payments for at least a year before you even start funding the <strong>tax sheltered investment account</strong> that you're trying to buy under the umbrella of life insurance. You'll have to do a lot of homework to hunt down a reputable discount broker or a direct policy purchase from the insurance company.</p>

<p>Life insurance requires insurable need. The description is vague enough, that you can probably still get the account despite being a single male with no apparent heirs to benefit, but it raises the question of why you are buying the insurance. Whole life policies require you to maintain a certain ratio of investment to premium payment and you will likely never be able access all of the money in the account for your own personal usage.</p>

<p>Compare several policies from several brokers and companies. Read all the critical sources you can about the pitfalls and dangers of commissions, fees and taxes eating the benefits of your account. Verify that the insurance company you buy the policy from is financially stable after the market crash. You are paying a commission to pool your money into their investment fund, and if your insurer goes under, you'll have to get a portion of your money (possibly only the principle) back from the state insurance commissioner. Some companies sold pretty generous policies during the bubble and have cut their offerings way down without fixing their marketing literature and rosy promises. </p>

<p>Finally, let us know what you find. It never hurts to see hard numbers and to run multiple eyes over the legalese in these contracts.</p>

"Taxing GoFundMe Donations","8268","","<p>I'm like 99% sure this would not be income for us.  Reason why is because it will never be associated with any of our bank accounts.  This money will be withdrawn directly to my sister's account.</p>

However this money is going to my sister's account and will never touch mine.  But we are likely to have 200 donors.  Will I be held liable for taxes? Or does anyone have more on this? </p>

<p>I mentioned to my uncle that this money will never reach any of my accounts.  He was unsure whether or not I would still be liable.  So I am asking if anyone knows the legality of that? So maybe I should cross post in legal? Thanks! </p>
","<p>I'm going to post this as an answer because it's from the GoFundMe website, but ultimately even they say to speak with a tax professional about it. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Am I responsible for taxes? (US Only)</strong></p>
  
  <p>While this is by no means a guarantee, donations on GoFundMe are
  simply considered to be ""personal gifts"" which are not, for the most
  part, taxed as income in the US. However, there may be particular,
  case-specific instances where the income is taxable (dependent on
  amounts received and use of the monies, etc.).    </p>
  
  <p>We're unable to
  provide specific tax advice since everyone's situation is different
  and tax rules can change on a yearly basis. We advise that you
  maintain adequate records of donations received, and consult with your
  personal tax adviser.    </p>
  
  <p>Additionally, WePay will not report the funds
  you collect as earned income. It is up to you (and a tax professional)
  to determine whether your proceeds represent taxable income. The
  person who's listed on the WePay account and ultimately receives the
  funds may be responsible for taxes.    </p>
  
  <p>Again, every situation is

<p>And here's a blurb from LibertyTax.com which adds to the confusion, but enforces the ""speak with a professional"" idea:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Crowdfunding services have to report to the IRS campaigns that total
  at least $20,000 and 200 transactions. Money collected from
  crowdfunding is considered either income or a gift.</p>
  
  <p>This is where things get a little tricky. If money donated is not a
  gift or investment, it is considered taxable income. Even a gift could
  be subject to the gift tax, but that tax applies only to the gift
  giver.</p>
  
  <p>Non-Taxable Gifts</p>
  
  <p>These are donations made without the expectation of getting something
  in return. Think of all those Patriots’ fans who gave money to
  GoFundMe to help defray the cost of quarterback Tom Brady’s NFL fine
  for Deflategate. Those fans aren’t expecting anything in return –
  except maybe some satisfaction -- so their donations are considered
  gifts. Under IRS rules, an individual can give another individual a
  gift of up to $14,000 without tax implications. So, unless a Brady fan
  is particularly generous, his or her GoFundMe gift won’t be taxed.</p>
  
  <p>Taxable Income</p>
  
  <p>Now consider that same Brady fan donating $300 to a Patriots’ business
  venture. If the fan receives stock or equity in the company in return
  for the donation, this is considered an investment and is not taxable
  . However, if the business owner does not offer stock or equity in the
  company, the money donated could be considered business income and the
  recipient would need to report it on a tax return.</p>

"Choosing between two car deals on the same car - NPV","8243","","<p>This is basic question, but I have starred myself blind on it - I am stuck. I am not sure which formulae I should use. Here is the story. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am looking to buy a car. I have found two dealerships willing to sell the car. </p>
  
  <ol>
  <li><p>XCars can sell the car for 25,000 with a down payment of 2,000 and the balance (25,000 - 2,000 = 23,000) paid in equal monthly installments (annuity) over 3 years - i.e. 36 months of equal loan payments.</p></li>
  <li><p>YCars are willing sell the same type of car for 22,500 if I pay cash, i.e. they give a 2,500 discount.</p></li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>Effective annual discount rate: 7 %. </p>
  
  <p>Which car dealer shoud I choose?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Net present value (NPV) calculation seem like the right way to solve the problem, but I am really unsure if I am on the right path. </p>

<p>Hoping for some help / some pointers.</p>
","<p>The solution is in the comments.</p>

<p>To solve the problem find the effective monthly interest rate <code>r</code> and then calculate <code>NPV</code>:</p>

<pre><code>r = 1.07^(1/12)-1 = 0.00565 
</code></pre>

<p>Next, find the annuity factor for 36 months (AF36) which becomes:</p>

<pre><code>AF36 = (1 - (1,00565)^(36)) / 0,0565 = 32.4898
</code></pre>

<p>Then multiply AF36 with the monthly installments to get the PV and finally add the down payment to get the NPV.</p>

<pre><code> Car price (XCars) = -25000 
 - with a -2000 down payment that gives a remaining amount to be borrowed:
 Loan amount = -23000

 Monthly installment (annuity) = -23000/36 = -638.88

 PV  = AF36 * monthly installment = 32.4898 * -638.88 = -20757.38
 NPV = -2000 + -20757.38 = -22757.38
</code></pre>

<p>Since <code>-22,757.38</code> (XCars) is lower (larger in absolute terms) than <code>-22,500.00</code> (YCars) you should buy the car today at YCars (i.e. do not loan to buy the car at XCars). </p>

<p>On the other hand, if the interest rate <code>r</code> is e.g. <code>8%</code> it would make more sense to take a loan because the NPV of the loan would be higher (i.e. closer to 0).</p>

<pre><code> Interest rate r = 9% =&gt; NPV = -22,194.66.
 Interest rate r = 8% =&gt; NPV = -22,472.13.
 Interest rate r = 7% =&gt; NPV = -22,757.38.
 Interest rate r = 6% =&gt; NPV = -23,050.72.
 ...
</code></pre>

<p>At an interest rate of exactly <code>7.9011%</code>, the NPV of the loan and the ""buy now"" options are equal and both options are equally good. This not taking into account tax perspective like interest rate deductions, though.</p>

<p>This is a constructed example but the interest rate <code>r</code> and <code>car price</code> could easily be applied to the US 30 year mortgage rate, and the formulas used here are valid for real life applications.</p>

<p>Yes, it's possible to get this down to zero, and in fact desirable. Any transactions in there should be reviewed and fixed. You can delete it once you've emptied it, but it will be recreated the next time an unbalanced transaction is entered. Ideally, I figure it should autohide unless there's something in it, but it's a minor annoyance.</p>

<p>Presumably you've imported a lot of data into what's known as a <strong>transaction account</strong> like checking, and it's all going to Imbalance, because it's double entry and it has to go <em>somewhere.</em> Open up the checking account and you'll see they're all going to Imbalance. You'll need to start creating expense, liability and income accounts to direct these into. </p>

<ul>
<li>Does it not make sense to invest in mutual fund because not only my money is there to be used whenever I want to without having to wait till I am 65 but also because it is taxed at a much lower tax bracket than 401k?</li>
</ul>
","<p>Your analysis is not comparing apples to apples which is why it looks like investing money in a non-qualified account is better than a 401k (traditional or Roth). </p>

<p>For the non-qual you are using post tax dollars (money that has already been taxed). Now on top of that original tax you are also going to pay capital gains tax for any growth plus dividend rates for any dividends it throws off. </p>

<p>For the 401k, let's assume for the moment that $10,000 is invested in a traditional and that the marginal tax rate is always 20%. And for growth let's assume 10x. With a traditional your money will grow to $100,000 and then the IRS gets $20,000 as you pull the money out. The result is a net 80,000 for you. </p>

<p>For a Roth 401k, it is taxed first so only $8,000 gets invested. This then grows by the same multiplier to $80,000. (Until you consider changing tax rates the Roth and traditional give the same growth of money).</p>

<p>Considering the non-qual option, like with the Roth we only have $8,000 to invest. However in this case you will not realize the full 10x growth as you will have to pay taxes on $72,000. These are taxes that the 401ks (and also IRAs) do not pay.</p>

<p>There are other reasons to consider non-qual over maxing out your 401k. Liquidity, quality of investments, and fees being some of those. But the capital gains rate vs. ordinary income rate is not one, as the money in the non-qual still has to go through that ordinary income tax first before it is available to even invest. </p>

They also say that I can trade up for no out of pocket expense. </p>

<p>This seems like they would have to simply give people a really long term on the loan in order to finance the higher value. (More payments...more interest overall.) Can anyone with experience explain how this kind of deal works? Something tells me it's not in my best interests. </p>

<p>In reality, they play a shell game and have you focus on your monthly payment. By extending the loan to 4 or 5 years (or longer), they can make your monthly payment lower, sure, but the total amount paid is much higher.</p>

"What is the meaning of ""short selling"" or ""going short"" a stock?","8115","","<p>Can someone please explain the meaning of 'shorting' a stock with an example?</p>
","<p>This is a gross simplification as there are a few different ways to do this. The principle overall is the same though.</p>

<p>To short a stock, you borrow X shares from a third party and sell them at the current price. You now owe the lender X shares but have the proceeds from the sale. If the share price falls you can buy back those shares at the new lower price, return them to the lender and pocket the difference.</p>

<p>The risk comes when the share price goes the other way, you now owe the lender the new value of the shares, so have to find some way to cover the difference.

<hr>

<p>PS: I am not trying to rip off the government. I just want to know if it's legal.</p>
","<p>It seems that counting your father as your dependent shouldn't, in itself, cause him to be ineligible for SNAP.</p>

<p>Eligibility requirements for SNAP can be found on <a href=""http://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/eligibility"">this FNS page</a>. There are upper limits on the ""countable resources, such as a bank account"" that the beneficiary's household may have, and on that household's income. (There are some other requirements, too.) From what I can tell from your question, your father shouldn't be part of your household for SNAP purposes, because:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Everyone who lives together and purchases and prepares meals together is grouped together as one household.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you're transferring him money, I assume he's living and eating somewhere else, so it seems you are not part of his household.</p>

<hr>

<p>According to the IRS's Publication 501, your father is not required to be part of your household for IRS purposes to be your dependent. <a href=""http://www.irs.gov/publications/p501/ar02.html#en_US_2014_publink1000220954"">The test to qualify</a> is that a non-child dependent</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>must either:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li><p>Live with you all year as a member of your household, or</p></li>
  <li><p>Be related to you in one of the ways listed under <a href=""http://www.irs.gov/publications/p501/ar02.html#en_US_2014_publink1000220957"">Relatives who do not have to live with you.</a></p></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>However, by the <a href=""http://www.irs.gov/publications/p501/ar02.html#en_US_2014_publink1000220815"">""Special rule for parent""</a>, you may be able to use your father as your qualifying person (dependent) to be able to file as ""head of household"", so long as you pay more than half their support, and ""more than half the cost of keeping up a home that was the main home for the entire year for your father"".</p>

<p>I don't know if in this case the IRS would consider your father ""part of your household"" or not. Even if the IRS considered your father part of your household based on the way you filed your taxes, I think it's possible, as the IRS and FNS are two different entities, that the definition of your father's household for SNAP purposes could be different from the IRS's.</p>

Additionally, I understand this is not a legal forum wherein I can get legal advice.

<p>So, my soon-to-be ex-wife and I have an exceedingly expensive house with a lot of equity in it.  As part of the divorce settlement, I am going to be bought out of my share of the equity.  The question is, is this payout taxable income, or just a redistribution of my portfolio?  I'm assuming that in many ways, the buyout would be treated as if I were selling the house, but the happiest answer I could receive is, ""No - it's not.""</p>

<p>The controlling section is <a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1041"">IRC §1041</a>.  If the divorce agreement includes cash for transfer of the house, then it's not likely to be taxable.

Would I end up only paying 10% of that remaining $100, so $10, or 10% of the principal?</p>
","<p>First the bank wouldn't allow you to pay off the loan, so quickly, without a severe penalty. And primarily loan is amortized over the whole time period of your payments. The sum you pay goes to a part of the principal and part as interest. </p>

  <p>An interest-only loan is a loan in which, for a set term, the borrower pays only the interest on the principal balance, with the principal balance unchanged. At the end of the interest-only term the borrower may enter an interest-only mortgage, pay the principal, or (with some lenders) convert the loan to a principal and interest payment (or amortized) loan at his/her option.</p>

<p>If you believe this and can remind yourself of this, you will be able to see the down cycles of the market as an opportunity to buy stock ""on sale"". No one knows the future, so many people have found investing on a regular schedule to be helpful. By putting in the same amount of money each period, you will end up buying fewer shares when the market is up, and more when it is down. As long as your time horizon is appropriate, you should be able to wait out the ups and downs.</p>

<p>Stocks are volatile by their very nature, so if you find that you are very concerned by this, you might want to consider whether you should adjust the amount of risk in your investments, since over time, most people lose money by trying to ""time"" the market.

","<p>Dr. Sarwate's answers the need for the W-8BEN, and that's the answer you are looking for.</p>

<p>However, the W-8BEN is only required if the US company is paying you directly (i.e. you appear on the US company's payroll accounts).</p>

<p>This would be weird, in general, because US companies very quickly incorporate as a private entity in a foreign land.</p>

<p>For example, I expect your ""US Bank"" to become a separate ""US Bank India Private Limited"" company in India and reap the various tax subsidies India offers to new companies being setup in India.</p>

<p>I also expect you to get paid from <em>and</em> employed by ""US Bank India Private Limited"" instead of ""US Bank"".</p>

<p>In this general case, the requirement to fill the W-8BEN seems like a H.R. goof-up or paranoia.</p>

<p>Yet, there could be some specific cases, where you, even as an employee of ""US Bank India Private Limited"" might get paid by ""US Bank"".</p>

<p>In either case, filling out the W-8BEN seems to have been mandated by the H.R. and there is no US tax impact on you for filling it out. In case taxes are with-held, they would be in error, but you would have to do all the paperwork.</p>

"Time-Weighted Rate of Return & Money-Weighted Rate of Return","7947","","<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I am trying to figure out the computational difference between Time-Weighted Rate of Return (TWRR) and Money-Weighted Rate of Return (MWRR). </p>

<p>Let's say, I have a portfolio looking like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>2012-Q4</strong> - Begin Market Value (BMV) is $10,000, and End Market Value (EMV) $11,000. So, over the quarter, I made 10% on my stocks.</li>
<li><strong>2013-Q1</strong> - I decide I will invest another $4,000 in Cash Flow (C), so my BMV is now $15,000. If I make 5% this quarter, my EMV is now $15,750.</li>
<li><strong>2013-Q2</strong> - My portfolio didn't go so well last quarter, so I take $2,000 (C) out. My BMV is $11,750. I make 10% over this quarter so my EMV is now $12,925.</li>
</ul>

<h2>MWRR</h2>

<p>If I calculate my MWRR ( <code>(EMV - BMV) / BMV</code> ):</p>

<ul>
<li>2012Q4 = <code>($11,000 - $10,000) / $10,000</code> = 10%</li>
<li>2013Q1 = <code>($15,750 - $15,000) / $15,000</code> = 5%</li>
<li><p>2013Q2 = <code>($12,925 - $11,750) / $11.750</code> = 10%</p></li>
<li><p>MWRR = <code>(2012Q4 x 2013Q1 x 2013Q2) ^ (1/3)</code> = 7.93%</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>TWRR</h2>

<p>Then the TWRR ( <code>(EMV-BMV-C)/(BMV + .5 x C)</code> ):</p>

<ul>
<li>2012Q4 = <code>($11,000 - $10,000 - $0) / ($10,000 + 0.5 x $0)</code> = 10%</li>
<li>2013Q1 = <code>($15,750 - $15,000 - $4,000) / ($15,000 + 0.5 x $4,000)</code> = -19.1%</li>
<li><p>2013Q2 = <code>($12,925 - $11,750 + $2,000) / ($11,750 + 0.5 x -$2,000)</code> = 29%</p></li>
<li><p>TWRR = <code>(2012Q4 x 2013Q1 x 2013Q2) ^ (1/3)</code> = ??</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<p>So, my two questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>As there are negatives in my TWRR's, it doesn't make sense to use a Geometric Mean (nor is it possible with imaginary numbers). The rates are still dependent in time, so a geometric mean would SEEM the appropriate way to weight them. What other ways can I aggregate my TWRR's?</li>
<li>The TWRR numbers seem way off. I certainly wouldn't have lost 20%, even weighted for cash-in/cash-out. What am I doing wrong?</li>
</ul>

","<p>The TWRR calculation will work even with negative values:</p>

<p>TWRR = (1 + 0.10) x (1 + (-0.191) ) x (1 + 0.29) ^ (1/3) = 1.047 which is a 4.7% return.</p>

<p>Your second question concerns the -19% return calculated for the second quarter.  You seem to think this return is ""way-off"".  Not really.  The TWRR calculates a return by accounting for cash that was added or deducted to/from the account.  So if I started with $100,000, added $10,000 to the account, and ended up with $110,000, what should be the return on my investment?  My answer would be 0% since the only reason my account balance went up was due to me adding cash to it.  Therefore, if I started with $100,000, added $10,000 in cash to the account, and ended up with $100,000 in my account, then my return would be a negative value since I lost the $10,000 that I deposited in the account.</p>

<p>In the second quarter you started with $15,000, deposited $4,000, and ended with $15,750.  You essentially lost almost all of the $4,000 you deposited.  That is a significant loss.</p>

"Why are businesses allowed to deduct expenses from their income, while individuals generally cannot?","7925","","<p>In general, it's an accepted principle that businesses should be allowed to deduct expenses. How did this principle come about? And why doesn't it appear to apply to individuals to the same extent?</p>

<p>Now I understand that businesses can't willy-nilly deduct every single expense they incur. I also understand that individuals are able to take certain expense deductions (like mortgage interest and a standard deduction in the U.S.) Despite that, it seems like businesses are able to deduct far more expenses than individuals can. Examples:</p>

<ol>
<li>Businesses are allowed to deduct salaries, but individuals can't deduct what they pay their gardener or housekeeper (at least in the U.S.)</li>
<li>Businesses are allowed to deduct utility expenses as overhead, while individuals cannot.</li>
<li>Food, shelter, clothing, and medical care are fundamental human needs, but we still pay for them with after-tax money, and pay additional sales tax. Only interest (and not principal) on a mortgage is deductible in the U.S., which is great for people who take out mortgages (and helps banks get more business), but you're out of luck if you pay cash for your house, or are renting.</li>
</ol>

<p>Why is this?</p>
","<p>In the US there's no significant difference between what a business can deduct and what an individual can deduct. However, you can only deduct what is <strong>an expense to produce income</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Businesses are allowed to write off salaries, but individuals can't
  write off what they pay their gardener or maid (at least in the US)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you're a sole proprietor in the business of managing properties - you can definitely deduct payments to gardeners or maids. Business paying for a gardener on a private property not related to producing the income (like CEO's daughter's house) cannot deduct that expense for tax purposes (although it is still recorded in the business accounting books as an expense - with no tax benefit).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Businesses are allowed to deduct utility expenses as overhead, individuals cannot</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Same thing exactly. I can deduct utility expenses for my rental property, but not for my primary residence.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Food, shelter, clothing and medical care are fundamental human needs,
  but we still pay for them with after-tax money, and pay additional
  sales tax. Only interest (and not principal) on a mortgage is
  deductible in the US, which is great for people who take out mortgages
  (and helps banks get more business, I'm sure), but you're out of luck
  if you pay cash for your house, or are renting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sales taxes <strong>are</strong> deductible. You can deduct sales taxes you paid during the year if you itemize your deduction. You can chose - you either deduct the sales taxes or the State income taxes, whatever is more beneficial for you.</p>

<p>BTW in many states food and medicine are exempt from sales tax.</p>

<p>Medical expenses <strong>are</strong> deductible if they're significant compared to your total income. You can deduct medical expenses in excess of 10% of your AGI. With the ACA kicking in - I don't see how would people even get to that. If your AGI is low you get subsidies for insurance, and the insurance keeps your expenses capped. For self-employed and employed, insurance premiums are pre-tax (i.e.: not even added to your AGI).</p>

<p>Principle for mortgage is not deductible because it is not an expense - it is equity. You own an asset, don't you?</p>

<p>You do get the <strong>standard</strong> deduction, even if your itemized (real) deductions are less - business don't get that. You also get an exemption amount (for your <em>basic</em> living needs), which businesses don't get. You can argue about the amounts - but it is there.</p>

<p>In some States (like California) renters get tax breaks for renting, depending on the AGI. CA renters credit is phasing out at AGI of about $60K, which is pretty high.</p>

<p>Say I had a hunch that a certain stock was going to fall next week, how could I effectively make a profit on this.</p>
","<p>The three normal ways profit on falling stock prices are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Short sale: Borrow someone else's shares. Sell at current price. Wait for price to fall. Buy back at lower price. Return shares to owner.</li>
<li>Buy put options with a strike price lower than current price. When stock drops below strike price of put, either buy shares at new low price and exercise the option to sell at a high price, or sell the option.</li>
<li>Sell/write call options with strike price above current share price. As share price goes down no one exercises the call options. When they expire, keep the money made from selling them.</li>
</ol>

<p>However, all three of the above are extremely dangerous for a novice investor and are not recommended to anyone without significant experience and understanding of derivatives, as well as the willingness to risk unlimited amounts of money.</p>

<p>I have saved up some money (around $80,000) and I'm currently investigating strategies for using market corrections as an investment opportunity. </p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> What's the best strategy for investing money during a correction? </p>
","<p>What's the best strategy? Buy low and sell high.</p>

<p>Now. A lot of people try to do this. A few are successful, but for the most part, people who try to time the market end up worse. A far more successful strategy is to save over your entire lifetime, put the money into a very low-cost market fund, and just let the average performance take you to retirement.</p>

<p>Put another way, if you think that there is an obvious, no-fail, double-your-money-due-to-a-correction strategy, you're wrong. Otherwise everyone would do it. And someone who tells you that there is such a strategy almost surely will be trying to separate you from a good amount of your money. </p>

<p>In the end, $80K isn't a life-altering, never-have-to-work-again amount of money. What I think you ought to do with it is: pay off any credit card debts you may have, pay a significant chunk of student loan or other personal loan debts you may have, make sure you have a decent emergency fund set aside, and then put the rest into diversified low-cost mutual funds. Think of it as a nice leg-up towards your retirement. </p>

"What prevents investors from buying high yield stocks and selling them as soon as their dividend is paid out?","7896","","<p>What prevents investors from buying high yield stocks and selling them as soon as their dividend is paid out? </p>

<p><strong>I guess I am confused:</strong> If you know the yield and when the dividend will be paid out, why not buy a share an instant before the dividend is paid out and then sell it?</p>

<p>Do you have to have held the share for some amount of time to get the dividend?
Is there too much volatility in the instant the dividend is paid out?</p>
","<p>You have to be the owner of record before the <em>ex-dividend date</em>, which is not the same day as the date the dividend is paid. This also implies that if you sell on or after the ex-dividend date, you'll still get the dividend, even if you no longer own the stock. </p>

<p>Keep in mind, also, that the quoted price of the stock (and on any open orders that are not specifically marked as ""do not reduce"") on its ex-dividend date is dropped by the amount of the dividend, first thing in the morning before trading starts. If you happen to be the first order of the day, before market forces cause the price to move, you'll end up with zero gain, since the dividend is built into the price, and you got the same value out of it -- the dividend in cash, and the remaining value in stock. As pointed out in the comments (Thanks <strong>@Brick</strong>), you'll still get a market price for your trade, but the price reduction will have had some impact on the first trade of the day.</p>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=""http://nyserules.nyse.com/nyse/rules/nyse-rules/chp_1_3/chp_1_3_8/chp_1_3_8_5/default.asp"">NYSE Rule 118.30</a></p>

<p>Also, remember that the dividend yield is expressed in annualized terms. So a 3% yield can only be fully realized by receiving all of the dividend payments made by the company for the year. You can, of course, forget about individual companies and just look for dividends to create your own effective yield over time. But, see the final point...</p>

<p>Finally, if you keep buying and selling just to play games with the dividends, you're going to pay far more in transaction fees than you will earn in dividends. And, depending on your individual circumstances, you may end up paying more in capital gains taxes.</p>

"What are some creative ways to run up my credit card bill without any cost to me?","7888","","<p>I got a new credit card with a very large signup bonus - as long as a minimum amount is spent on the card in the first 3 months.  I usually don't go for things like this but in this case the bonus is so large that it's worth the hassle.  The amount I have to spend is probably about $5000 more than I would normally spend in this time.</p>

<p>What are some creative ways that I can ""spend"" this money, without:</p>

<ul>
<li>taking on extra cost (I could just send my friend $5000 via paypal, pay the 3% or whatever, and be done with it - but I don't want to lose that 3%)</li>

<ul>
<li>Pre-buy gifts.  Do your Christmas shopping now.  Even if you don't know what to buy, you can get gift cards to the stores you are likely to buy from.</li>
<li>Pre-buy non-perishables.  This would include cleaning supplies, and wrapping for gifts.</li>
<li>Pre-buy auto maintenance.  You'll probably have to change your oil two or three more times this year.  If you DiY get GC to your favorite auto parts store, if you have it changed does your service station offer GCs?  What about tires, etc?</li>
<li>On your utilities that do not charge a fee for CCs, why not pay extra?  If your cell phone is 100/mo, why not pay for the next 12 months or so?  Then use that $100 to replenish savings.</li>
<li>if you are paying car or renter insurance monthly, you can prepay them also and save some $30 on car insurance alone.</li>

<p>So how then does Fidelity make money off a customer like me?</p>
","<p>The Fidelity funds have an expense ratio, and while some funds may have little to no profit, having you as a customer lets them try to sell you on their managed account/portfolio and other services. </p>

<p>It's possible they don't make much or any money from you at all, but with so many accounts it's fine as long as it averages out. Similar to having a credit card and never paying interest on it, but reaping the rewards anyway. Averaged out, they make plenty of money across all accounts.</p>

<p>An <a href=""http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expenseratio.asp"">expense ratio</a> is usually given as a percentage, and it's the amount you pay for the fund per year. If it has a 1% ER, and you have $1,000 invested in it, then it costs you $10 for the year (a very simplified example). You won't notice this as a direct transaction since it gets taken from the funds assets directly, but this is lowering the return (or worsening the loss) on the fund.</p>

<p>You can find the ER in your Fidelity account for any funds that are available to you.</p>

"What happens if pending charges total more than my ""total available credit""?","7806","","<p>I have what I think is an easy question, but I can't find the answer to it either here or through my credit card company's website.</p>

<p>I have an available credit of some amount, let's say $5000. If two separate charges of $3000 go on that credit card, then I will be above my total credit. Theoretically this is bad, but I'm not entirely sure what that means.</p>

<p>My actual question has to do with these charges as they're pending, however. When these charges first go on my card, they are pending for a few days. <strong>1)</strong> If, during those few days, I pay off $3000 on my credit card, can I still get in trouble for having had >$5000 in <em>pending</em> charges? <strong>2)</strong> If I pay off the $3000 during this period, but this transfer is still pending when both charges go through and are no longer pending, what happens? <strong>3)</strong> How about when only one charge goes through before my transfer?</p>

<p>Update - Daniel's answer made sense to me. As to what actually happened: my payment went through several days before the incoming charges went through (so I had a temporary balance of -$3000 on my card) even though both charges were pending before my payment. Even though I had paid off $3k when both charges were pending, I had an available credit of $0, and so couldn't use my credit card for anything else. No extra fees, no long-lasting issues, just a tied-down credit card for several days.</p>
","<p>This can be a tricky question, because every bank has its own way of handling such situations.</p>

<p>When a charge is <em>""pending""</em>, it means the bank has issued a temporary authorization to a merchant for a charge, but the charge itself hasn't yet been posted.  Sometimes that can take several days, during which the charge still shows as ""pending"", because it's possible the merchant may cancel the transaction or modify the amount of the transaction.  This is why most banks will not let you dispute a pending charge.  For instance, let's say you make a charge at a store, and that store obtains an authorization for a pending charge against your card.  Typically when you dispute a charge, the bank will force a chargeback on the merchant and credit your card back, thus making you whole again.  But there's always the possibility that the merchant can still cancel the transaction, which releases the authorization hold, in which case you've benefitted doubly (once when the bank refunded your money and again when the merchant cancels the charge).  To prevent this, banks will request that you wait until the pending charge actually posts before they will process a dispute claim (I recently experienced this with my Discover card).</p>

<p>Your bank may have a policy where it will allow authorizations to occur which exceed your credit line, because they are not yet considered actual transactions until the merchant charge is processed.  In the scenario you've laid out, whichever merchant posts their transaction first wins, and the second authorization, which would now exceed your limit, could be rejected by the bank when the merchant tries to post it.  Your bank may also have a policy for allowing you to go over limit by a certain amount or percentage of your credit limit, but with some <strong>very</strong> stiff penalties and fees.</p>

<p>To the next leg of your question, your payment may or may not actually post before the merchant transaction, but assuming the two are processed simultaneously, most banks apply credits first and then debits next, so your payment would be posted to your account first, then any charge debits would be applied.  <strong><em>This assumes that your payment and one of the two charges are posted at the same time.</em></strong></p>

<p>Nobody can give you a specific answer outside of you calling your bank to find out what's been received and how it will be posted, because we don't have enough detail (both about your transactions and Bank of America's internal accounting procedures) to give you a definitive answer.  Every bank is different.</p>

<p>Is it possible this was not the correct form for the executor to have used to report the inheritance?</p>
","<p>Sounds like your grandmother's estate had taxable income and the estate did not pay the estate ""INCOME"" tax.  Rather the estate shifted the burden to pay that tax on the beneficiaries which is why you received a K1.  If that K1 reports income received by you, then YES you would have to amend your tax return.  I am in exactly that same situation now.  After the October 15 deadline to file 2012 tax returns, I received a K1 for income received from my dad's estate.  I now have to file a late amended 2012 income tax return and pay income tax on what I inherited. My dad had a small estate, but the money that made up that small estate all came from an IRA he had.  He designated the estate as his beneficiary.  So when the stocks in the IRA were sold, that all became taxable income to the beneficiaries of the estate.</p>

<p>I'm not currently putting any money <em>into</em> my savings because I'm trying to pay off that loan first.  </p>

<p>Alternately, I could dump <em>some</em> of my savings into the loan so that I'm not left without a safety net in case of emergencies - but I'm not sure how much I should reasonably keep in Savings for such emergencies.  </p>

There's $100/mo for 2 month-long bus passes, $185 for health insurance including dental (going independent right now would be insanely expensive, so we're planning to switch once my company's open enrollment starts) and 3% of my pre-tax paycheck going into a deferred compensation plan.  </p>
","<p>Keep 3-6 months (or more if you need to, for me the number is 9 months) worth of expenses in an emergency fund.  Put the rest against the student loan.  </p>

<p>The length of time depends on your situation.  I have family, and work in IT.  Changing jobs takes me longer, because ... reasons.  Having less than 6-9 months of buffer means that I have to rush and possibly take a position that is not a good fit, or get behind on payments.</p>

<p>So, set aside your emergency fund, add to it if you need to.  Once it is fully funded, take the money you were using to fund the emergency fund and budget that to clearing student loans.  Also, don't start new credit cards, and be sure to never carry a balance on them.</p>

<p>I know it seems like a lot, but keep in mind that yours is small, and you'll likely be able to knock it out in a very short time.</p>

<p>Edit (after OP listed expenses): Taking into account the expenses you listed, it looks like you have about 2000 per month in expenses (if you're in emergency fund mode, luxuries can wait, and you can tighten the belt on food, so go with the lower end of your estimate.)  Lets say you have 600 a month to work with.  <strong>My suggestion would be bring savings up to $6000.  That will take you two months.  Then pay 850 a month to student loans.  You'll be paid off in a year, and still have 6000 for emergencies.</strong></p>

<p>Once you're done, you will have 850 a month to save and invest.  With patience, persistence and care, you can start a nest egg that will allow you to remain financially independent.  Search around for FIRE (financial independence, retire early) and other strategies for retirement savings and investing.  Be sure to save for retirement.

is between 1% and 2%) then after five years when you are fully vested,
you have the right to get 5x% of your salary starting from the full retirement
date (as stated in the pension plan rules).</p>

<p>Another meaning of vesting is about 401k plans where you cannot
take the employer match with you if you quit or are fired before
full vesting occurs.  Your own contributions are yours to take
at any time, but the employer's contributions can be taken
only after vesting.</p>

<p>Partial vesting means you are entitled to the fraction vested
of the full benefit.  For example, for a 401k plan,
after one year you are entitled to take 20% of the matching
funds contributed by your employer, after two years, 40% etc.
Remember that over 5 years your employer will likely contribute
increasing amount, but even if not, you will be entitled to
20% of first year match, 40% of two years' match (including
earnings), 60% of three years.... etc.</p>

"Pros/cons for buying gold vs. saving money in an interest-based account?","7736","","<p>Over the years, I have noticed a certain pattern when it comes to money and gold.</p>

<p>For example, my father bought a house 30 years ago for $20,000, and today that house is worth $200,000.  If my father did not buy the house 30 years ago, and just stored the money in a zero interest account, he would not be able to buy that same house today for $20,000.</p>

<p>If he had stored the money into an interest based account, the stored money would have increased, but no way would it have increased enough to buy the same $200,000 house today.</p>

<p>Anyway, what I have noticed about gold is that my wife has some gold which she inherited 4 years ago where the value was estimated at $3,000.  Today the same gold seems to be estimated at around $8,000, in just 4 years...</p>

<p>So why store money in a bank account, would it not be better to buy gold instead of storing money in an interest based account?</p>

<p>What am I overlooking?  I get the feeling I am overlooking something, otherwise everyone would be buying gold like mad instead of sticking money into bank accounts.</p>
","<p>As Michael McGowan says, just because gold has gone up lots recently does not mean it will continue to go up by the same amount.</p>

<p>This plot:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jS720.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>shows that if your father had bought $20,000 in gold 30 years ago, then 10 years ago he would have slightly less than $20,000 to show for it.</p>

<p>Compare that with the bubble in real estate in the US:

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I was curious about <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/users/187/joetaxpayer"">JoeTaxpayer's</a> question: how do US house prices track against US taxpayer's ability to borrow?  To try to answer this, I used <a href=""http://www.jparsons.net/housingbubble/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the house price data from here</a>, <a href=""http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/pmms30.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the 30 year fixed mortgages here</a> and <a href=""http://www.measuringworth.com/datasets/uswage/result.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the US salary information from here</a>.</p>

<p>To calculate the ""ability to borrow"" I took the US hourly salary information, multiplied by 2000/12 to get a monthly salary. I (completely arbitrarily) assumed that 25 per cent of the monthly salary would be used on mortgage payments.  I then used Excel's ""PV"" (Present Value) function to calculate the present value of the thirty year fixed rate mortgage.</p>

<p>The resulting graph is below.  The correlation coefficient between the two plots is 0.93.</p>

"Help me understand the oddity of percentage gains and losses?","7728","","<p>If you start with $100K, and you get a 50% gain, it's $150K.  Then, you get a 50% loss: now it's $75K. Reverse the order (i.e. lose 50%, gain 50%), it's the same thing (a 25% loss).  So, 50% up then 50% down, or 20% up then 20% down, you don't get back to ""even""; it's a loss.</p>

<p>My question is: how can one make this notion work to their advantage, instead of to their disadvantage?  I'm wondering if you have any strategies/thoughts/ideas on how to make this effect work for you, instead of against you. Or is my thinking on this as a strategy somehow incorrect?</p>

<p>The effect seems to diminish with lower swings in returns.  E.g. the +20% / -20% case, results in a 4% loss.  I.e. 100K -> 120K -> 96K.  Not clear what the formula for it is, but it's not linear.</p>
","<p>Other answers have pointed out the mathematics behind this ""notion"", as you put it &ndash; and I hope the explanations were helpful &ndash; while failing to answer with a potential strategy (save for duffbeer703).  Here it is:</p>

<p>The way you take advantage of <strong>swings in the market</strong> (to generalize) is to:</p>

<ul>
<li>invest more cash in the market before the up moves, and</li>
<li>remove cash from the market before the down moves.</li>
</ul>

<p>As you've seen, if you start with $100K <em>fully invested</em>, with the market dropping 50% first and then gaining 50% from there while <em>remaining</em> fully invested, then you're down $25K.  <strong>But what if you were to add $100K when you are down?  Then you are ahead of the game by $25K after the 50% gain.</strong></p>

<p>Next, consider the opposite ordering of the moves: the market gaining 50% first, then dropping 50%. Similarly, with the $100K fully invested, you end up down $25K.  <strong>But what if you take half your stake out at the top?  Then you are ahead of the game by $12.5K.</strong> Or you could be ahead the full gain if you sell everything at the top.</p>

<p>Of course, this ""buy low, sell high"" or ""market timing"" strategy is easier to <em>describe</em> than actually <em>perform</em>, and the market isn't likely to deliver X% gains followed by X% losses (or vice versa) consistently .. it is more temperamental than that. In fact it often goes exactly where you didn't expect it: down when you are fully invested, and up when you aren't.</p>

<p>But, successful trading is the way to take advantage of moves in the market that would otherwise do damage to a fully-invested portfolio ...  <strong>""successful""</strong> being the highly elusive secret ingredient.</p>

<p>Many of my friends said I should invest my money in stocks or something else instead of putting it in the bank forever. I do not know anything about finance, so my questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is my financial status OK? If not, how can I improve it?</li>
<li>Is now a right time for me to see a financial advisor? Is it worth the money? How would she/he help me?</li>
</ul>
","<p>Whether your financial status is considered ""OK"" depends on your aspirations.  You aren't spending more than you earn and have no debt.  That puts you in the category of OK in my book, but the information in your post indicates that you would benefit from some financial advice--100 grand sounds like a lot of money to have in a bank unless you are on the verge of spending it.</p>

<p>Financial advisors come in various shapes and sizes.  Many will charge you a lot for what turns out to be helpful advice in the first meeting, but very little value-added thereafter.  Some don't have the best incentives (they may be incentivized to encourage you to put your money into certain funds, for example).</p>

<p>There are many financial advisors (of sorts) that you have access to that won't cost you anything.  For example, if you have a 401(k) at work, I bet there is a representative from the plan administrator that will meet with you for free.  If you open a brokerage account or IRA at any place (Fidelity, Vanguard, etc.) you can easily talk with one of their reps and get all sorts of advice.  My personal take is to meet with anyone who will meet with me for free, but not to pay anyone for this service.  It's too easy to get good advice and paying for it doesn't guarantee that you get better advice.</p>

<p>Your financial situation will depend primarily on a few things you have not mentioned here.  For example,</p>

<ul>
<li><p>How much are you setting aside for retirement and what are your retirement goals?  This is something lots of people can give you advice on, but we don't know what market returns will be going forward so we don't really know.  One bit of advice that may benefit you is how to set aside money for retirement in the most tax advantaged way.</p></li>
<li><p>How much do you feel that you need saved up for large expenses?  Thinking of starting a family?  How many months worth of income are you comfortable having set aside?</p></li>
<li><p>What is your tolerance of risk?  If you put your money in risky assets, you may make more, but you may also actually lose money. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Those are the questions a financial advisor will ask about.  Once you have his/her advice--and preferrably after talking to a few advisors--you can make your own decision. Basically, your options are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Keep saving in banks or other safe assets (make sure you are using the highest interest-rate paying bank you can find)</li>
<li>Put additional money into an IRA or other retirement vehicle in order to save on taxes</li>
<li>Open a (normal, taxable) brokerage account and start buying financial assets.</li>
<li>Buy real assets, like real estate, gold<sup>1</sup>, collectibles, guns<sup>1</sup>, etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>Rules of thumb: Save only what makes sense to save in banks given your expected needs for cash. Put a lot in tax advantaged accounts (don't give Uncle Sam any gifts). Then look at financial and real investments.</p>

<p>There are a number of free resources on the internet.  For example <a href=""http://www.futureadvisor.com"">FutureAdvisor</a>.  Or you can hit up the forums at <a href=""http://www.bogleheads.org"">BogleHeads</a>.  Those guys give and receive financial advice as a hobby.  They aren't professionals, but you can get a lot of varying ideas and make up your own mind, which to me is better than (just) asking a professional.</p>

<p>BTW, regarding the ESPP: these plans often give you a discount on stock and can therefore be a good idea.  Just be sure you don't hold the stock longer than you need to.  It's generally a bad idea to concentrate your wealth in <em>any</em> single investment, especially one highly correlated with your background risk (i.e., if the company does poorly you will already be worse off because you may lose your job or see fewer advancement opportunities. No need to add losses in your savings to that).</p>

","<p>Foreclosure is at a high level the bank declaring that the debtor cannot pay their <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promissory_note"" rel=""nofollow"">promissory note</a> (their debt).  This is shortly followed by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_%28finance%29"" rel=""nofollow"">default</a>, which is the removal of debtors rights to the property.  After the debtor has defaulted, he either chooses to voluntarily remove himself and his belongings from the property, or is forcibly <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eviction"" rel=""nofollow"">evicted</a>.  In the US eviction is carried out by local law enforcement, such as the sheriff's office.  </p>

<p>The bank is now the sole owner of the property, and proceeds to sell it, in an attempt to recoup their investment.  If the bank cannot recoup their investment by selling the house, the rest may be converted to unsecured debt against the debtor.

","<p>As long as you are disciplined about it, you can certainly have your emergency fund and other savings funds in one account.  Multiple accounts may incur added costs, since you may not have the minimum balances to avoid the fees.  Some banks provide tools or account features to help track separate ""buckets"" of funds within one account.</p>

<p>One important principle for an emergency fund is liquidity.  Those funds should be easily accessible, ideally without withdrawal penalties or transaction costs.  For this reason, certificates of deposit (CD) or money market funds should be avoided for this purpose.</p>

<p>Another important principle, for any savings fund, is capital preservation/safety.  That money should not be held in risky assets.  Depending on the purpose of the fund, you may consider other options beyond just a savings account.  For example, you may consider placing funds for a house in CD(s) early on, before you are actually looking for the house.  As you get closer to having enough for a down payment, you would shift that money into a savings account.  One drawback of such an approach is the extra management that this requires on your part.</p>

<p>A spreadsheet is a simple way to track these funds, though that requires more manual management and discipline to do that tracking.  It also requires some knowledge of spreadsheets, but it provides you with flexibility so you can create a process that works well for you.  Any accounting software should allow you to do this in some fashion with (hopefully) less effort than maintaining a spreadsheet, though you may have to do things in a certain way that may be awkward in some cases.</p>

<p>Those are the basic principles that come to mind.  I am sure others can provide more specific suggestions, like banks which allow you track buckets of funds or accounting software that can help you track the funds.</p>

"What are some tips for getting the upper hand in car price negotiations?","7557","","<p>My family wheels are pushing 200K miles and lights are starting to come on, noises are starting to come out, and I want to investigate a newer car before I sink money into repairing mine.</p>

<p>What are some tips when purchasing a new car?</p>

<p>I am going to get pre-approved for a loan from a bank or credit union, but I will still let the car dealer see if they can beat my existing offer.</p>

<p>I more than likely won't buy a new car, and whatever I do buy I expect to be able to pay off in cash in less than six months.  (I hope to save up enough to do a cash deal and get myself a 2005+ model; but I am planning in case my current car up and dies sooner than later).</p>

<p>Any thoughts on negotiating over email with a dealership?</p>
","<p>I read a really good tract that my credit union gave me years ago written by a former car salesman about negotiation tactics with car dealers. Wish I could find it again, but I remember a few of the main points. </p>

<p><strong>1) Never negotiate based on the monthly payment amount.</strong><br>
Car salesmen love to get you into thinking about the monthly loan payment and often start out by asking what you can afford for a payment. They know that they can essentially charge you whatever they want for the car and make the payments hit your budget by tweaking the loan terms (length, down payment, etc.) </p>

<p><strong>2) (New cars only) Don't negotiate on the price directly.</strong><br>
It is extremely hard to compare prices between dealerships because it is very hard to find exactly the same combination of options. Instead negotiate the markup amount over dealer invoice. </p>

<ul>
<li>For common cars that they have a lot
of competition on or
too many of them on the lot, you
might be able to get away with as
little as $100 over invoice.   </li>
<li>In most situations you will pay between $300-$1000 markup over invoice.  </li>
<li>For high-demand or special order cars you
might have    to pay several thousand
over invoice.</li>
<li>Ask to see the actual dealer
invoice for the car before closing
the deal. Sometimes they will claim
they don't have it or can't show it
to you. This is a lie. Walk away if
they insist that it isn't available
to show you. Something crooked is
afoot.</li>
<li>Don't listen to sob stories about how
much it costs to market and sell the
car. The car dealership will 90% of
the time make more money on the deal
than the difference between the
dealer invoice and the purchase
price. The manufacturers have
""holdbacks"" which are extra bonuses
for selling the cars, also they make
money on the financing and other
aspects of the deal.</li>
<li>This tactic requires you have a reasonably good idea of the invoice price walking into the deal so you aren't negotiating blind. Luckily this information is available in numerous places like <a href=""http://www.kbb.com"">NADA</a> and <a href=""http://www.edmunds.com/"">Edmunds.com</a>  </li>
<li>This tactic also basically requires you to pretty much know what car you want when you walk into the dealership, or at least that you narrowed it down to a few.  If you are still making up your mind, do not buy the car that day. You are at too much of an information disadvantage. Decide what you want; go home and research it on the Internet; then go back and buy it.  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3) Negotiate one thing at a time</strong><br>
A favorite shell game of car dealers is to get you to negotiate the car price, trade-in price, and financing all at one time. Unless you are a rain-man mathematical genius, don't do it. Doing this makes it easy for them to make concessions on one thing and take them right back somewhere else. (Minus $500 on the new car, plus $200 through an extra half point on financing, etc). </p>

<ul>
<li>To keep them from trying to mix the financing in the deal, just tell them you already have your financing worked out or are paying cash, even if you don't. It isn't like they are going to complain if you change your mind after agreeing on a price for the car to go with them for financing. </li>
<li>Don't let them re-open the negotiations on other items when discussing the trade-in, new car price, or financing terms.  </li>
<li>See handling the trade-in below  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>4) Handling the Trade-In</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Before you even look at a new car, get a firm written quote for your trade-in.   </li>
<li>Alternately, you can do the same trick as the financing and claim you aren't trading in a car until you have completed negotiation on the new car price.  </li>
<li>It is a good idea to bring with you quotes on your trade-in from other dealers to help your negotiating power. </li>
<li>Most car dealers will buy your trade-in even if you don't buy a car from them. They will argue that you will save on sales taxes by doing both transactions at the same time (reducing the purchase price by the trade-in amount). It is true that you will save money, but when you do the math the amount is trivial. </li>
<li>They want your trade more than they want to sell a new car, they make a much higher profit on turning around used cars than new ones.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>5) 99.9999% of the time the ""I forgot to mention"" extra items are a ripoff</strong><br>
They make huge bonuses for selling this extremely overpriced junk you don't need.   </p>

<ul>
<li>Scotch-guard <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00006IA8O"">you can buy for less

<li>Rust proofing - Often just an overpriced wax job. If you read carefully the factory warranty usually protects you against rust for a number of years anyway. </li>
<li>Pin striping - Usually just a decal applied to the car, also very cheap to have done elsewhere.</li>
<li>Extended warranty - Usually a rip-off, but not as frequently as the other items mentioned. If it is 3rd party , not from the manufacturer, it is always a rip off.</li>
<li>Financing ""Insurance"" - For a few dollars more a month, they will give you insurance to make your car payment in case you become disabled or unable to make your payment for some other prescribed reason. Think about it, YOU are paying for insurance to prevent the LOAN COMPANY from losing money in the event you get into trouble. Not worth the money.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>6) Scrutinize everything on the sticker price</strong><br>
I've seen car dealers have the balls to add a line item for ""Marketing Costs"" at around $500, then claim with a straight face that unlike OTHER dealers they are just being upfront about their expenses instead of hiding them in the price of the car. Pure bunk. If you negotiate based on an offset from the invoice instead of sticker price it helps you avoid all this nonsense since the manufacturer most assuredly did not include ""Marketing costs"" on the dealer invoice.</p>

<p><strong>7) Call Around before closing the deal</strong><br>
Car dealers can be a little cranky about this, but they often have an ""Internet sales person"" assigned to handle this type of deal. Once you know what you want, but before you buy, get the model number and all the codes for the options then call 2-3 dealers and try to get a quote over the phone or e-mail on that exact car. Again, get the quote in terms of markup from dealer invoice price, not sticker price. Going through the Internet sales guy doesn't at all mean you have to buy on the Internet, I still suggest going down to the dealership with the best price and test driving the car in person. The Internet guy is just a sales guy like all the rest of them and will be happy to meet with you and talk through the deal in-person.</p>

<p>Update: After recently going through this process again and talking to a bunch of dealers, I have a few things to add:<br>
  <strong>7a)</strong> The price posted on the Internet is often the dealer's bottom line number. Because of sites like AutoTrader and other car marketplaces that let you shop the car across dealerships, they have a lot of incentive to put their rock-bottom prices online where they know people aggressively comparison shop.<br>
  <strong>7b)</strong> Get the price of the car using the stock number from multiple sources (Autotrader, dealer web site, eBay Motors, etc.) and find the lowest price advertised. Then either print or take a screenshot of that price. Dealers sometimes change their prices (up or down) between the time you see it online and when you get to the dealership. I just bought a car where the price went up $1,000 overnight. The sales guy brought up the website and tried to convince me that I was confused. I just pulled up the screenshot on my iPhone and he stopped arguing. I'm not certain, but I got the feeling that there is some kind of bait-switch law that says if you can prove they posted a price they have to honor it. In at least two dealerships they got very contrite and backed away slowly from their bargaining position when I offered proof that they had posted the car at a lower price.</p>

<p><strong>8) The sales guy has ultimate authority on the deal and doesn't need approval</strong><br>
Inevitably they will leave the room to ""run the deal by my boss/financing guy/mom"" This is just a game and negotiating trick to serve two purposes:<br>
 - To keep you in the dealership longer not shopping at competitors.<br>
 - So they can good-cop/bad-cop you in the negotiations on price. That is, insult your offer without making you upset at the guy in front of you.<br>
 - To make it harder for you to walk out of the negotiation and compromise more readily. </p>

<p>Let me clarify that last point. They are using a psychological sales trick to make you feel like an ass for wasting the guy's time if you walk out on the deal after sitting in his office all afternoon, especially since he gave you free coffee and sodas. Also, if you have personally invested a lot of time in the deal so far, it makes you feel like you wasted your own time if you don't cross the goal line. As soon as one side of a negotiation forfeits the option to walk away from the deal, the power shifts significantly to the other side.</p>

<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Don't feel guilty about walking out if you can't get the deal you want. Remember, the sales guy is the one that dragged this thing out by playing hide-and-seek with you all day. He wasted your time, not the reverse.</p>

"Why don't some places require a credit card receipt signature, and some do?","7543","","<p>I'm thinking of certain places (Subway, McDonalds, etc.) that do not require a signature on a receipt after swiping your card.  Why do these places not require a signature on the receipt, while others do?</p>
","<p>This is basically done to reduce costs and overhead, with agreement of the credit card issuers. When the card is physically present and the charge is low, the burden of keeping the signed receipts and of additional delays at the cash register is not worth the potential risk of fraud.</p>

<p>Depending on the location and the specific charge-back history of the business, the limit above which signature is required differs. In one supermarket in the area I live they require signatures only on charges above $50. In another, 10 miles away from the first one, they require signatures on charges above $25.</p>

"Is there a way to convert from a monthly rate to annual?","7510","","<p>This might seem like a silly question, but I'm trying to work out how much something will cost  if I pay for it on my credit card instead of paying monthly to the company at their interest rate. The problem is that my online card account only shows the rates in monthly (1.2916%), and the company offering credit only show theirs annually (23.46%).</p>

<p>Do I simply multiply the monthly rate by 12 – giving me 15.49% - or does it not work like that?</p>

<p>If that's the case, then there's something very weird going on with my maths.</p>

<pre><code>(11 instalments * £78.63) = £864.93
£864.93 * 1.2346 = £1067.82

"Is it normal to hold and pay for two apartments at once when moving?","7509","","<p>Let's say you're moving out of an apartment and your lease is up September 30th. Is it typical to rent an apartment available September 1st (assuming most apartments are available at the beginning of the month)?</p>

<p>This gives you a whole month to move, which seems wasteful to me since you're paying for two apartments during September.  Or is it more typical to move out on the last day of your old lease and move in the first day of your new one?</p>

<p>In this case how is the lease structured?  Do you have to take a hotel for a night and put your stuff in storage for a day?  </p>
","<p>The usual arrangement that I have seen, when moving in the same area, is to overlap the apartments by a few days.  Generally, the first months rent on the new apartment is prorated for the time you actually have possession of it.  So you take possession of the new place on 9/25 and turn over the old place on 9/30.  This has the advantage of making moving a bit less stressful since everything doesn't have to happen all at once (moving, cleaning, etc). If moving more than a day's drive away, it is less of an issue because you will be spending the night in a hotel (or your car) anyway.</p>

"Cash in retirement accounts to buy a house?","7503","","<p>My husband and I are looking to buy our first home.  He is 39 and I am 37.  We live in a major city and house prices are terrible.  We are probably looking at a 500K-600K home.  We were late bloomers, so to speak, so took a while to graduate and actually make steady income.  We now both have good jobs (combined salary of $150K) with pending raises (maybe 15K total) and good prospects for the future.  We also have 200K in student loan debt (which will be erased by the government--theoretically--in 8-9 years due to the type/field of loan) and about 45K in credit card debt (I know, but we are paying it off at approximately 2K/month)  </p>

<p>Our assets are:</p>

<ul>
<li>$8000 in savings (we can start bumping this up if we invest in it rather than paying down credit cards, but not by much)</li>
<li>Spouse 1 401K of $5000</li>
<li>Spouse 2 401K of $8000</li>
<li>Spouse 2 IRA of $28000</li>
</ul>

<p>The only way we can get a house right now is to cash in most or all of these accounts to put down a down payment, which would also slow down our credit card payments.  Part of me thinks that these accounts are pretty meager and it's a better investment than throwing money away on rent each month.  Part of me says I should suck it up and get a cheaper house outside of the city rather than repeat the mistakes of my youth, but I don't know how that will affect resale value.</p>

<p>We also are eager to start a family, and we're not getting any younger.  Our apartment is way too small for just the two of us, much less a child.  We'd have to move before we had a child and we'd like to live in our own house when we do.</p>

<p>EDITED to add:  When I say house, I mean condo.  I see that makes a difference based on some of the (great) answers.  And yes, a cheaper condo makes a car a necessity, which we have gotten by without so far.</p>
","<p>It is normally a bad idea to cash in retirement accounts to buy a house, in your case it is a horrible idea because you are way behind on saving for retirement.</p>

<p>Other fallacies in your reasoning:  </p>

<ol>
<li>A house is not an investment, it is an expense.   </li>
<li>Paying rent is not throwing your money away. </li>
<li>A cheaper house affects the resale value. That argument makes no sense to me. In terms of resale value the only number that matters is the difference between what you paid and what you later get back. Of course a cheaper house will have a lower resale value because it is worth less, that seems irrelevant to the decision process.</li>
</ol>

<p>My advice, increase the amount you are saving for retirement considerably, and also put some money aside to save for a down payment on a house. Buy the house when you have enough non-retirement money to afford the down payment. If you can't wait that long, buy a house you can afford.</p>

<p>It may help to think of it this way: Visualize yourself as a 65 year old retired person with very little income, and living on your retirement account. Would you as a 39 year old ask that person to give you $175,966 (the amount you are talking about withdrawing compounded annually at 6% interest for 25 years with no additional contributions) so that you could put a down payment on a house? Because that is what you would be doing. When you hit retirement age would you kick yourself for making such a decision? Because unless you die young, that person is sitting out there in your future needing that money to live off of.</p>

<p>Don't take this the wrong way, but the tone of your question seems like you are looking for support to make what you already know is a bad financial decision.</p>

"irr calculation on stock with dividends","7491","","<p>I want to calculate IRR (internal rate of return) for stock purchases. Not sure if I am doing it right, hope some of you might confirm it.<br>
Lets say I bought stock JNJ in 2005, 20 shares for $50 each. JNJ pays dividends quarterly. I am trying to differentiate two cases:  </p>

<ol>
<li>I get dividends in cash</li>
<li>I reinvest dividends and buy some extra JNJ (DRIP)</li>
</ol>

<p>I am using XIRR calculation - dividends might be paid irregularly or I might get cash and reinvest dividends on random occasion.
So I pass these data to calculate it:</p>

<ol>
<li>(date of purchase, -20x$50)</li>
<li>(date of dividend, dividend amount * stock price) #if I take cash</li>
<li>(date of dividend, dividend amount * stock price) #if I take cash</li>
<li>...</li>
<li>(today, today's value * shares)</li>
</ol>

<p>In case I reinvest dividends, I will include it in next rows in number of shares and also any future cash withdrawal will be higher (since I own more shares = more dividends).<br>
<strong>Question #1</strong>: Is this calculation ok?<br>
<strong>Question #2</strong>: If I buy 20 shares every year, how do I get proper IRR? I can not just include it to existing calculation, because XIRR calculates difference between date of purchase and dividend date (I would have multiple purchase dates). Or may I? Would I calculate average with respect to today's value of single purchase?<br>
<strong>Edit1:</strong><br>
Thanks for answer @Chris, but I don't think you understood my question, so I am posting examples:<br>
<strong>Question #1</strong>: I bought 20 shares of JNJ on 2014-01-01 for $89. Here is table of dividends and stock price on the dividend date:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/t8FUA.png"" alt=""jnj latest dividend history""><br>
If I <strong>cash out all</strong> dividends, will my XIRR function get these data:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eYtrm.png"" alt=""xirr simple table""><br>
Column C shows what is actually calculated in column B. Number of shares times dividend amount. This is how I calculate XIRR if I get dividends paid out in cash, correct (XIRR = 13%)?<br>
If I <strong>do not cash out, but reinvest these dividends</strong>, XIRR table looks like this:<br>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yHgNi.png"" alt=""xirr drip""><br>
Since I did reinvest my dividends, I do not have 20 shares on 2015-03-08
, but 20.707 - adds up to 2070.7 portfolio value and XIRR is 13.7%. Correct?<br>
<strong>Question #2</strong>:<br>
I bought 20 shares of JNJ on 2014-01-01 for $89 and 10 shares of JNJ on 2014-06-01 for $89 as well. This is my table:<br>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aBCOk.png"" alt=""miltiple xirr""><br>
Is this correct? In my point of view, XIRR calculates difference between initial date of purchase and date of each transaction(=dividend date). So for every next stock purchase, it will not calculate it's date to t(t in your formula), but date from first purchase as t.<br>
I can not describe it properly. Basicly, can I just add all next purchases like I did in Question #2 or do I need to calculate XIRR for seperate stock purchases and then combine them somehow. </p>

<p>Use the money-weighted return calculation:</p>

<p>where <code>t</code> is the fraction of the time period and <code>Ct</code> is the cash flow at that time period.</p>

<p>For the treatment of dividends, if they are reinvested then there should not be an external cash flow for the dividend.  They are included in the final value and the return is termed ""total return"".  If the dividends are taken in cash, the return based on the final value is ""net return"".</p>

<p>The money-weighted return for question 2, with reinvested dividends, can be found by solving for <code>r</code>, the rate for the whole 431 day period, in the NPV summation.</p>

<pre><code>From 2014-01-01 to 2015-03-08 is 431 days.
From 2014-01-01 to 2014-06-01 is 151 days.

NPV = 1780 + 890/(1 + r)^(151/431) - 3000/(1 + r) = 0

∴ r = 0.140739

<p>Now annualising</p>

<pre><code>(1 + r)^(365/431) - 1 = 0.117967 = 11.8 % total return per annum

","<p>Good question! It seems to me that there is no minimum order size for shares trading on the LSE. Please note, I couldn't find an definite answer, but:</p>

<p>According to the ""International Order Book"" document (see: <a href=""http://www.londonstockexchange.com/traders-and-brokers/rules-regulations/change-and-updates/stock-exchange-notices/2010/n2210_attach1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.londonstockexchange.com/traders-and-brokers/rules-regulations/change-and-updates/stock-exchange-notices/2010/n2210_attach1.pdf</a>) from the LSE (page 7):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Question 7: Would respondents support a revision of the minimum order 
  size of 50 units?   Whilst there was
  limited support for a low value based
  minimum order size the  majority of
  respondents requested its complete
  removal.  This was  incorporated into
  the September 2010 quarterly review as
  per Service  Announcement 001/100910
  and as from 20 September 2010, the

  securities has been 1 unit</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even though not all trading on the LSE is performed on this IOB system, it would be very wierd if the international stocks can be traded in any size, while domestic stocks will have an minimum size.</p>

<p>Further, consider looking to the times and sales of various stocks (here you can find an example <a href=""http://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/prices-and-markets/stocks/exchange-insight/trade-data.html?page=0&amp;fourWayKey=GB0006731235GBGBXSET1&amp;formName=frmRow&amp;upToRow=-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/prices-and-markets/stocks/exchange-insight/trade-data.html?page=0&amp;fourWayKey=GB0006731235GBGBXSET1&amp;formName=frmRow&amp;upToRow=-1</a>). Those trades also suggest that there is no minimum order size (for example, I just saw an executed trade with an size of 13).</p>

<p>At last, look at the Interactive Brokers (no relationship with) Exchange List at <a href=""http://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/exchanges.php?exch=lse&amp;showcategories=&amp;ib_entity=llc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/exchanges.php?exch=lse&amp;showcategories=&amp;ib_entity=llc</a>. Here you can click on various stock names, and in the popup window that opens, look for 'size parameters' and the size increment. I could only find stocks with an size increment of 1 (i.e. you can trade anything with a minimum of 1 stock, and more needs to be in steps of 1 stock).</p>

<p>Even though I couldn't find official information on the LSE site (like a leaflet for beginners or such), it does seem to me that you can trade any size you want on LSE. </p>

<p>Please note that mutual funds and illiquid OTC stocks which don't have an continuous market can have different rules, so double-check with your broker.</p>

You are going to have a tough time getting another 50k unsecured personal loan at anywhere near student-loan rates.  </p>

"How to report $27 in cap gains affordably","7445","","<p>I'm preparing my taxes using TurboTax's basic free tier. Last year I had <strong>$26.62</strong> in realized long term capital gains. To report this using TurboTax, I need Premier, which is a <strong>$54</strong> add on. </p>

<p>Even in a fairly low tax bracket, I'm assuming the IRS cares about every cent.  Is it possible to file that single form aside from the rest of my return? Do I have to fill out my whole return by hand to avoid this surcharge?</p>

<p>How do I keep this trade profitable despite tax season?  </p>

<p>An annoying conflating factor that applies to me and probably not most people trying to do this:  I already sunk $30 or so into the ""we retain your filings for you securely"" add-on, and I'd like to get some utility out of that money I spent. </p>
","<p>You are not the only one with this problem. When Intuit changed their pricing and services structure in 2015 <a href=""https://consumerist.com/2015/01/23/changes-to-turbotax-lead-to-consumer-revolt-opportunity-for-competitors/"">a lot of people got angry</a>, facing larger fees and having to go through an annoying upgrade just to get the same functionality (such as Schedule D, capital gains).</p>

<p>You have several options:</p>

<p>(1) Forget Turbo Tax and just use paper forms. That is what I do. Paper is reliable.</p>

<p>(2) Use <a href=""https://ttlc.intuit.com/questions/1914350-how-do-i-switch-to-forms-mode-in-the-turbotax-for-windows-software"">forms mode in Turbo Tax</a>. Of course, that may be even more complicated than simply filing out paper forms.</p>

<p>(3) Use a different service. If your income is below $64,000 the IRS has a free electronic filing service. Other online vendors have full taxes services for less than Turbo Tax.</p>

<p>(4) Add the amount to ordinary income. Technically, as long as you report the income, you cannot be penalized, so if you add the capital gain to your ordinary income, then you have paid taxes on the income. Even if they send you a letter, you can send an answer that you added it to ordinary income and that will satisfy them. Of course you pay a higher rate on your $26 if you do that.</p>

<p>(5) If you are in the 15% or below income bracket you are exempt from capital gains, and you can omit it. Don't believe the nervous Nellies who say the IRS will burn your house down if you don't report $26 in capital gains. Penalties are assessed on the percentage of TAXES you did not pay (0.5% penalty per month). Since 0.5% of $0 is $0 your penalty is $0. The IRS knows this. The IRS does not send out assessment letters for $0.</p>

<p>(6) Even if you are above the 15% bracket, there is likelihood it is still a no-tax situation (see 5 above).</p>

<p>(7) Worst case scenario: you are making a million dollars per year and you omit your $26 capital gains from your return. The IRS will send you an assessment letter for about $10. You can then send them a separate check or money order to pay it.</p>

<p>In all honesty I have omitted documented tax items, like taxable interest, that the IRS knows about many times and never gotten an assessment letter. Once I made a serious math error on my return and they sent me an assessment letter, which I just paid, end of story. And that was for a lot more than $26.</p>

<p>The technical verbiage for something like this in IRS lingo is <a href=""https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc652.html"">CP-2000, underreported income</a>. As you can see from this official IRS web page, basically what they do is guess how much they think you owe and send you a bill. Then you pay it. If you do so in time, you don't even get a 0.5% interest penalty on your $6.75 owed or whatever it is.</p>

<p>(8) Go hog wild. As long as you are risking an assessment on your $26, why not go hog wild and just let the IRS compute all your taxes for you? Make a copy of your income statements, then mail them to the IRS with a letter that says, ""Hi, I am Mr. Odinson, my SSN is XXX-XX-XXXX. My address is XYZ. I am unable to compute my taxes due to a confused state of mind. I am hereby requesting a tax assessment for the 2016 tax year."" Make sure you sign and date the letter. In all probability they will compute the full assessment and send you a bill (or refund).</p>

"Why do people buy new cars they can not afford?","7424","","<p>This question in particular refers to the U.S. It has always baffled me and I am looking for diverse viewpoints to help understand the issue. </p>

<p>Every day as I drive to work I see lots of new cars. US automakers regularly report bumper sales. Even Mall parking are packed with new (1-3 years old) cars. </p>

<p>I believe the ballpark estimate is that 90-95% of Americans use auto loans to finance car purchases. </p>

<p>I also estimate new cars cost on average $20-25K. Depending on loan term, I would estimate average payment (after all fees, interest, etc) at around $300-400/mo. I would estimate around $300/mo in gas. </p>

<p>Factoring in license/registration, oil changes, other occasional maintenance you are out at least $5K/yr. And you don't even own it until it's paid off. And it's guaranteed to be worth a lot less by then because of depreciation. How is that a smart investment or use of debt financing?</p>

<p>In contrast, suppose you buy a 5-year old compact sedan with about 60K miles for around $8-9K. Assuming similar annual financial outlay, you would pay it off in about 2-2.5 years. After that you are free and clear for the rest of the car's life. That's reasonably 20 years. If you buy a new car as soon as you pay off the old one, that's $100K over 20 years. </p>

<p>Considering this math, I am wondering why isn't it a norm in the U.S. to buy used cars and drive them to death for 20-25 years? Why doesn't the overwhelming majority of the U.S. population subscribe to a frugal mindset of using a car only as a means of basic transportation from point A to point B. Why are people willing to take out car loans that are easily 50%-75% of their take-home net annual pay? </p>

<p>Does everybody know something that I am missing? It would be great to hear a few perspectives. </p>
","<p><strong><em>There are many reasons for buying new versus used vehicles. Price is not the only factor.</em></strong> </p>

<p>This is an <em>individual decision</em>. Although interesting to examine from a macro perspective, each vehicle purchase is made by an individual, weighing many factors that vary in importance by that individual, based upon their specific needs and values. I have purchased both new and used cars, and I have weighted each of these factors as part of each decision (and the relative weightings have varied based upon my individual situation).</p>

<p>Read <strong><em>Freakonomics</em></strong> to gain a better understanding of the reasons why you cannot find a good used car. The summary is the imbalance of knowledge between the buyer and seller, and the lack of trust. Although much of economics assumes perfect market information, <em>margin (profit) comes from uncertainty</em>, or an imbalance of knowledge.  Buying a used car requires a certain amount of faith in people, and you cannot always trust the trading partner to be honest.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Price</em></strong> - The price, or more precisely, the value proposition of the vehicle is a large concern for many of us (larger than we might prefer that it be).</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Selection</em></strong> - A buyer has the largest selection of vehicles when they shop for a new vehicle. Finding the color, features, and upgrades that you want on your vehicle can be much harder, even impossible, for the used buyer. And once you have found the exact vehicle you want, now you have to determine whether the vehicle has problems, and can be purchased at your price.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Preference</em></strong> - A buyer may simply prefer to have a vehicle that looks new, smells new, is clean, and does not have all the imperfections that even a gently used vehicle would exhibit. This may include issues of pride, image, and status, where the buyer may have strong emotional or psychological needs to statisfy through ownership of a particular vehicle with particular features.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Reviews</em></strong> - New vehicles have mountains of information available to buyers, who can read about safety and reliability ratings, learn about problems from the trade press, and even price shop and compare between brands and models. Contrasted with the minimal information available to used vehicle shoppers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Unbalanced Knowledge</em></strong> - The seller of a used car has much greater knowledge of the vehicle, and thus much greater power in the negotiation process. Buying a used car is going to cost you more money than the value of the car, unless the seller has poor knowledge of the market. And since many used cars are sold by dealers (who have often taken advantage of the less knowledgeable sellers in their transaction), you are unlikely to purchase the vehicle at a good price.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Fear/Risk</em></strong> - Many people want transportation, and buying a used car comes with risk. And that risk includes both the direct cost of repairs, and the inconvenience of both the repair and the loss of work that accompanies problems. Knowing that the car has not been abused, that there are no hidden or lurking problems waiting to leave you stranded is valuable. Placing a price on the risk of a used car is hard, especially for those who only want a reliable vehicle to drive. Placing an estimate on the risk cost of a used car is one area where the seller has a distinct advantage.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Warranties</em></strong> - New vehicles come with substantial warranties, and this is another aspect of the Fear/Risk point above. A new vehicle does not have unknown risk associated with the purchase, and also comes with peace of mind through a manufacturer warranty. You can purchase a used car warranty, but they are expensive, and often come with (different) problems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Finance Terms</em></strong> - A buyer can purchase a new vehicle with lower financing rate than a used vehicle. And you get nothing of value from the additional finance charges, so the difference between a new and used car also includes higher finance costs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Own versus Rent</em></strong> - You are assuming that people actually want to <em>'own'</em> their cars. And I would suggest that people want to <em>'own'</em> their car until it begins to present problems <em>(repair and maintenance issues)</em>, and then they want a new vehicle to replace it. But renting or leasing a vehicle is an even more expensive, and less flexible means to obtain transportation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Expense Allocation</em></strong> - A vehicle is an expense. As the owner of a vehicle, you are willing to pay for that expense, to fill your need for transportation. Paying for the product as you use the product makes sense, and financing is one way to align the payment with the consumption of the product, and to pay for the expense of the vehicle as you enjoy the benefit of the vehicle.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Capital Allocation</em></strong> - A buyer may need a vehicle (either to commute to work, school, doctor, or for work or business), but either lack the capital or be unwilling to commit the capital to the vehicle purchase. Vehicle financing is one area banks have been willing to lend, so buying a new vehicle may free capital to use to pay down other debts (credit cards, loans). The buyer may not have savings, but be able to obtain financing to solve that need.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Remember, people need transportation. And they are willing to pay to fill their need. But they also have varying needs for all of the above factors, and each of those factors may offer value to different individuals.</p>

"As a 22-year-old, how risky should I be with my 401(k) investments?","7417","","<p>As a 22 year old guy, how should I plan my financial life regarding my 401(k) investments? How much risk should I be taking?</p>

<p>Also, is it a good idea to invest in a dynamic portfolio with smart beta ETF's managed by an active portfolio manager?</p>
","<p>At 50 years old, and a dozen years or so from retirement, I am close to 100% in equities in my retirement accounts.  Most financial planners would say this is way too risky, which sort of addresses your question.  I seek high return rather than protection of principal.  If I was you at 22, I would mainly look at high returns rather than protection of principal.</p>

<p>The short answer is, that even if your investments drop by half, you have plenty of time to recover.  But onto the long answer.</p>

<p>You sort of have to imagine yourself close to retirement age, and what that would look like.  If you are contributing at 22, I would say that it is likely that you end up with 3 million (in today's dollars).  Will you have low or high monthly  expenses?  Will you have other sources of income such as rental properties?  </p>

<p>Let's say you rental income that comes close to covering your monthly expenses, but is short about 12K per year.  You have a couple of options:</p>

<ol>
<li>You could work one more year and save some cash outside of retirement.</li>
<li>Maybe 3-5 years before retirement you could direct the majority of your contributions to cash equivalents.</li>
<li>A combination of 1 and 2.</li>
</ol>

<p>So in the end let's say you are ready to retire with about 60K in cash above your emergency fund.  You have the ability to live off that cash for 5 years.  You can replenish that fund from equity investments at opportune times.  Its also likely you equity investments will grow a lot more than your expenses and any emergencies.  There really is no need to have a significant amount out of equities.  In the case cited, real estate serves as your cash investment.</p>

<p>Now one can fret and say ""how will I know I have all of that when I am ready to retire""?  The answer is simple: structure your life now so it looks that way in the future.  You are off to a good start.  Right now your job is to build your investments in your 401K (which you are doing) and get good at budgeting.  The rest will follow.  After that your next step is to buy your first home.</p>

<p>Good work on looking to plan for your future.</p>

"Electric car lease or buy?","7416","","<p>I know the conventional wisdom for leasing vs. buying, but are the economics of an electric car significantly different than other vehicles?</p>
","<p>There are some who argue that you should lease an electric car. These factors are in addition to all the normal pros and cons of leasing vs. buying.</p>

<p>The technology is still new and is advancing rapidly. In 2-3 years, the newer model may have significantly improved features, range, and efficiency, as well as lower prices. If you are the type of person to upgrade regularly to the latest and greatest, leasing can make it a smoother transition.</p>

<p>It is hard to predict the depreciation of the vehicles. This is both because of the above factors, but also because these kinds of cars are newer and so the statistical models used to predict their future values are less refined. The models for predicting gas car prices have been honed for decades. EV Manufacturers have in the past made some mistakes in their residual value estimations.</p>

<p>When you lease a car, you get essentially an option to buy the car at the future predicted residual value. If, at the end of the lease, the market value of the car is higher than the residual value, you can purchase the car at the predetermined price, making yourself some extra money. If the value is lower than the residual, you can return the car or renegotiate.</p>

<p>I know a relatively large number of electric vehicle owners. Most or all of the ones who got the vehicle new leased it. The rest bought used vehicles coming off lease, which can also be a good deal.</p>

"How exactly does dealing in stock make me money?","7409","","<p>Soon I will be coming into a bit of extra money. Rather than simply sticking it in a savings account I would like to make my money work for me and getting into stock seems to be a good way to do that.</p>
","<p>This is a very good question!</p>

<p>The biggest difference is that when you put money in a savings bank you are a lender that is protected by the government, and when you buy stocks you become an owner.</p>

<p>As a lender, whether the bank makes or loses money on the loans it makes, they still maintain your balance and pay you interest, and your principal balance is guaranteed by the government (in the USA). The bank is the party that is primarily at risk if their business does not perform well.</p>

<p>As an owner, you participate fully in the company's gains and losses, but you also put your money at risk, since if the company loses money, you do too. Because of this, many people prefer to buy funds made up of many stocks, so they are not at risk of one company performing very poorly or going bankrupt. When you buy stock you become a part owner and share in the profitability of the company, often through a dividend.</p>

<p>You should also be aware that stocks often have years where they do very poorly as well as years when they do very well. However, over a long period of time (10 years or more), they have historically done better in outpacing inflation than any other type of investment. For this reason, I would recommend that you only invest in the stock market if you expect to be able to leave the money there for 10 years or more, ideally, and for 5 years at the very least. Otherwise, you may need to take the money out at a bad time.</p>

<p>I would also recommend that you only invest in stocks if you already have an emergency fund, and don't have consumer debt. There isn't much point in putting your money at risk to get a return if you can get a risk-free return by paying off debt, or if you would have to pull your money back out if your car broke down or you lost your job.</p>

"Why do banks require small businesses to open a business bank account instead of a cheaper personal one?","7404","","<p>I understand the need to separate personal finances and the business finances, be it sole-proprietorship or incorporation. I also understand that in the former it's optional, but in the latter it is required.</p>

<p>What I don't get is why do I have to pick from the bank's selection of ""business accounts"" (I am talking chequing and savings accounts). Most of the times, those business accounts are more expensive than personal ones, with no extra features that would benefit a small business or contractor-type incorporation.</p>

<p>Can't I just open a separate personal account and use that for business? If not, why not?</p>

<p>I am interested to hear the answer for both, sole-proprietorship and incorporation.</p>
","<p>The bank won't let you because:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Differences in required account features</strong> &mdash; Business accounts have different features (many of them legal features) that are required by businesses. For instances:</p>

<p>Do you want to be able to deposit cheques that are written out to your business name? You need a business account for that.</p>

<p>Your business could be <em>sold</em>. Then it wouldn't be <em>your</em> business, so it wouldn't make sense to put the business account under <em>your</em> personal name. The bank account and the cash it holds is a business asset and should be owned by the business, so when the business is sold the account goes with it. This is especially the case for a corporation that has shareholders, and not a sole proprietorship.</p>

<p>For a business, you could also, in theory, assign other people as signing authorities on the business account (e.g. your corporate treasurer), and the individuals performing that role could change over time. Business accounts allow for this kind of use.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Market segmentation</strong> &mdash; The bank has consciously undertaken to <em>segment</em> their product offerings in order to maximize their profit. Market segmentation helps the bottom line. Even if there were zero legal reasons to have separate personal vs. business accounts, banks would <em>still</em> make it their policy to sell different account types according to use because they can make more money that way.</p>

<p>Consider an example in another industry: The plain-old telephone company also practices segmentation w.r.t. personal/business. Do you want a telephone line for a business and listed as such in the phone book? You need a business line. Do you want a phone line hooked up at a non-residential address? You need a business line. Here it's clear it is less of a legal issue than with the bank account, and it doesn't matter that the technical features of the phone line may be identical for the basic product offerings within each segment. The phone company has chosen to segment and price their product offerings this way.</p></li>

"Leased a car but did not use the mileage - what options do I have","7393","","<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>

<p>About three years ago I was victim of carjacking. My car (Honda) which I owned got totaled and after a month of working with insurance I got a equivalent value of my car from insurance and the next day I leased a Chevy for 3 years / 36K miles. I was really upset because of the incident, so I did not negotiated very well with the dealer and I believe I did not get a good deal.</p>

<p><strong>But most importantly</strong> I grossly overestimated the mileage that I believed I could use in three years. The reason was I tried to avoid using my car or driving due that carjacking incident. I am always worried something can happen and I become a victim again. So, I primary used public transportation, Uber and Taxi during the past three years.</p>

<p>Long story short, I have a few months until my lease and I have not used even 5K miles yet.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong>
I understand that it was my mistake to overestimate the mileage but how can I control the damage?
I (believe) I have few options:</p>

<ol>
<li>pay the amount written on lease agreement and buy the car</li>
<li>extend the lease for one or two more years</li>
<li>(if it is possible) get an incentive from the dealer to lease another car</li>
</ol>

<p>I talked with the dealer last week (I felt he is not very honest with me) and he said: <em>option #3 is not possible under any circumstances</em>.</p>

<p>Please let me know if there are other options that I do not know it about. Thanks.</p>
","<p>The most important question is: What's your buyout price and what's your car worth?</p>

<p>If your 3 year old car has less than 5K miles on it, most likely it's worth  more than your buyout price. If it's a car you would consider purchasing with 36K miles on it, then you're getting a great bargain if you can pay the same amount for a car with 5K on it. If you're not interested in purchasing the car for yourself, you should still be able to buy and sell it for a profit. If you don't want to deal with trying to find a buyer before your lease is up, you could try taking it to CarMax or somewhere similar and see what they offer you for your car. If the amount they offer you is more than your buyout they will assist you with the entire process and you could walk away with some cash. If your car is in great condition I'd bet you come out ahead.</p>

<p>Also, regarding your option #3 - you don't have to necessarily lease another car. If the car is worth significantly more than the buyout, any dealer would want it, so you could ""shop around"" and see who offers you the most for your car. Note you can also return your car to any GM dealer, so talk to other Chevy dealers too. Your dealer may be downplaying your options with the hopes that you'll just turn it in to them.</p>

"Why pay for end-of-day historical prices?","7391","","<p>Recently I've started gathering some end-of-day (EOD) prices data for my testing. The first obvious place where such data is freely available is Yahoo Finance site. However I've noticed that many data providing companies sell this data, and not so cheap. So my question is: why would anyone purchase this data if it is freely available on Yahoo? One of my assumptions would be the data packaging (as Yahoo only allows you to download the data file-by-file) but then there are dozens of downloaders freely available on the nets. So do I miss something? Is this Yahoo data not reliable enough?</p>
","<p>There are several reasons to pay for data instead of using Yahoo Finance, although these reasons don't necessarily apply to you if you're only planning to use the data for personal use. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Yahoo will throttle you if you attempt to download too much data in a short time period. You can opt to use the Yahoo Query Language (YQL), which does provide another interface to their financial data apart from simply downloading the CSV files. Although the rate limit is higher for YQL, you may still run into it. An API that a paid data provider exposes will likely have higher thresholds. </p></li>
<li><p>Although the reliability varies throughout the site, Yahoo Finance isn't considered the most reliable of sources. You can't beat free, of course, but at least for research purposes, the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) at UChicago and Wharton is considered the gold standard. On the commercial side, data providers like eSignal, Bloomberg, Reuters also enjoy widespread popularity.</p></li>
<li><p>Although both the output from YQL and Yahoo's current CSV output are fairly standard, they won't necessarily remain that way. A commercial API is basically a contract with the data provider that they won't change the format without significant prior notice, but it's reasonable to assume that if Yahoo wanted to, they could make minor changes to the format and break many commercial applications. A change in Yahoo's format would likely break many sites or applications too, but their terms of use do state that Yahoo ""may change, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of the Yahoo! Finance Modules at any time, including the availability of any Yahoo! Finance Modules. Yahoo! may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict your access to parts or all of the Yahoo! Finance Modules or the Yahoo! Web site without notice or liability.""</p></li>
<li><p>If you're designing a commercial application, a paid provider will probably provide technical support for their API. </p></li>
<li><p>According to Yahoo Finance's license terms, you can't use the data in a commercial application unless you specifically use their ""badges"" (whatever those are). See <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/badges"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. In <a href=""http://developer.yahoo.com/forum/General-Discussion-at-YDN/Using-Yahoo-Finance-API-Not-RSS-/1250246255000-0b82f8f0-7f48-3af2-8fe2-e73a138cbfaa"" rel=""nofollow"">this post</a>, a Yahoo employee states:</p></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Finance TOS is fairly specific. Redistribution of data is only
  allowed if you are using the badges the team has created.</p>
  
  <p>Otherwise, you can use YQL or whatever method to obtain data for
  personal use.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/badges/tos"" rel=""nofollow"">license</a> itself states that you may not:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>sell, lease, or sublicense the Yahoo! Finance Modules or access
  thereto or derive income from the use or provision of the Yahoo!
  Finance Modules, whether for direct commercial or monetary gain or
  otherwise, without Yahoo!'s prior, express, written permission</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In short, for personal use, Yahoo Finance is more than adequate. For research or commercial purposes, a data provider is a better option. Furthermore, many commercial applications require more data than Yahoo provides, e.g. tick-by-tick data for equities, derivatives, futures, data on mergers, etc., which a paid data source will likely provide.</p>

<p>Yahoo is also known for inaccuracies in its financial statements; I can't find any examples at the moment, but I had a professor who enjoyed pointing out flaws in the 10K's that he had come across. I've always assumed this is because the data were manually entered, although I would assume EDGAR has some method for automatic retrieval. If you want data that are <em>guaranteed</em> to be accurate, or at least have a support contract associated with them so you know who to bother if it isn't, you'll need to pay for it. </p>

<p>However, if you notify them in writing to dispute the debt, the debt collector has to stop collection of the debt and send you written verification of it (which they already should have anyway). Per the act:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>b) If the consumer notifies the debt collector in writing within the thirty-day period described in subsection (a) that the debt ... is disputed, or that the consumer requests the name and address of the original creditor, <strong>the debt collector shall cease collection of the debt ...  until the debt collector obtains verification of the debt or any copy of a judgment</strong>, or the name and address of the original creditor, and a copy of such verification or judgment, or name and address of the original creditor, is mailed to the consumer by the debt collector. </p>
  
  <p>c) The failure of a consumer to dispute the validity of a debt under this section may not be construed by any court as an admission of liability by the consumer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for debt collectors that don't follow the act, <a href=""http://www.ftc.gov/os/statutes/fdcpa/fdcpact.shtm#813"" rel=""nofollow"">section 813</a> (<strong>Civil Liability</strong>), lays out the consequences clearly. I won't quote it because it's a little long, but it's important to realize that per the title, these are <strong>civil penalties.</strong> That means they normally require a suit to be filed against the debt collector; if you read this section of the act, you can readily see that the penalties will occur <em>as the result of civil legal action.</em></p>

<p>In short, yes, the debt collector is required to send you verification within a short time period after initially informing you. If they don't, <strong>you need to talk to a lawyer</strong> if you feel civil action is the best recourse. Since I'm not a lawyer, I can't, and don't, pretend to provide any meaningful legal advice.</p>

<p><strong>Side note:</strong> I should add that one <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Debt_Collection_Practices_Act#By_consumer_groups"" rel=""nofollow"">criticism</a> of the FDCPA is that it limits the civil penalties the court can award an individual, above and beyond the damages caused by the debt collection agency, to $1,000. The act was passed in 1977, so inflation has reduced the real amount and purchasing power of that award.</p>

"How is yahoo finance P/E Ratio TTM calculated?","7378","","<p>I'm a beginner in all these stats, but I understand PE Ratio as displayed on google finance, e.g for BP.L it's nearly 6.</p>

<p>However the stat seems different in yahoo finance, because it's PE TTM,  where it is reported as 363!  Then they have a ""forward"" P/E but that seems different too.</p>

<p>So how can/should the P/E ttm be interpreted?  I presume the TTM is key and is what difference is to google finance.  But having looked around i'm struggling to see why / how it's calculated.

<p>Thanks, Dan</p>
","<p>The correct p/e for bp.l is 5.80.</p>

<p>Bp.l is on the London stock exchange and prices are in local currency. The share price of 493 is reported in pence (not dollars). The EPS is reported in pounds. Using .85 pounds = 85 pence, you calculate the EPS as follows:</p>

<p>493.40/85 = 5.80 PE</p>

<p>Yahoo totally screwed up. They converted the .85 pounds into US dollars ($1.34) but didn't convert the 493 pence. By using the 493 as dollars, they got 493.9/1.34 = 368 pe!</p>

<p>Notice that Yahoo reports the American Depository Shares (symbol 'BP') with an EPS of $8.06. That correctly reflects that there are 6 shares of BP.l per ADS (1.34 * 6 = 8.04). But why is the share price listed at $46.69? Well... </p>

<p>493 GBp (pence) = 4.93 pounds</p>

<li>Sell all the shares using a limit order of any amount between $1 to $2 above your original purchase price.</li>
</ol>

<p>What are the downsides of this investment strategy? How can this strategy be improved?</p>

<h1>EDIT</h1>

<hr>

<p>John Bensin, pretty much answered most of my concerns. However, I never specified that the trades have to be done within the same day. Also, according to my ""algorithm"" a sale only takes place once the stock rises by 1 or 2 points; otherwise the stock is held until it does. So to revise:</p>

<ol>
<li>Let the investor open up 5 brokerage accounts at 5 different firms (for safeguarding against being labeled a ""Pattern Day Trader"").</li>
<li>Each account may only hold 1 security at any time, for the span of 1 business week.</li>
<li>Once the funds settle--this usually takes up to 5 business days--place a limit sale order, of any amount between $1 to $2 above your original purchase price .</li>
</ol>

<p>Assuming one has the funds, couldn't such a system generate some sort of passive income? Having 5 securities at one time benefits from diversification. Of course a bigger number would be preferable.</p>

<p>To address the commission fee problem, assuming a fee of $8 per trade (I was actually able to find firms with  fees ranging from <a href=""http://www.optionshouse.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">$4</a> to <a href=""https://www.tradeking.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">$5</a> per trade), and a minimum of $100 profit per sale, we get $100 - $16 (1 buy, 1 sell) = $84. Still acceptable.</p>
","<p><strong>Yes.</strong> There are several downsides to this strategy:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You aren't taking into account commissions. If you pay $5 each time you buy or sell a stock, you may greatly reduce or even eliminate any possible gains you would make from trading such small amounts. This next point sounds obvious, but remember that you pay a commission on <em>every</em> trade regardless of profit, so every trade you make that you make at a loss also costs you commissions. Even if you make trades that are profitable more often than not, if you make quite a few trades with small amounts like this, your commissions may eat away all of your profits. Commissions represent a fixed cost, so their effect on your gains decreases proportionally with the amount of money you place at risk in each trade.</p></li>
<li><p>Since you're in the US, you're required to follow the <a href=""http://www.sec.gov/answers/patterndaytrader.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">SEC rules on pattern day trading</a>. From that link, ""FINRA rules define a “pattern day trader” as any customer who executes four or more “day trades” within five business days, provided that the number of day trades represents more than six percent of the customer’s total trades in the margin account for that same five business day period."" If you trip this rule, you'll be required to maintain $25,000 in a margin brokerage account. If you can't maintain the balance, your account will be locked.</p></li>
<li><p>Don't forget about <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_gains_tax_in_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">capital gains taxes</a>. Since you're holding these securities for less than a year, your gains will be taxed at your ordinary income tax rates. You can deduct your capital losses too (assuming you don't repurchase the same security within 30 days, because in that case, the <a href=""http://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/washsale.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">wash sale rule</a> prevents you from deducting the loss), but it's important to think about gains and losses in real terms, not nominal terms. The story is different if you make these trades in a tax-sheltered account like an IRA, but the other problems still apply.</p></li>
<li><p>You're implicitly assuming that the stock's prices are skewed in the positive direction. Remember that you have limit orders placed at the upper <em>and</em> lower bounds of the range, so if the stock price decreases before it increases, your limit order at the lower bound will be triggered and you'll trade at a loss. If you're hoping to make a profit through buying low and selling high, you want a stock that hits its upper bound before hitting the lower bound the majority of the time. Unless you have data analysis (not just your intuition or a pattern you've talked yourself into from looking at a chart) to back this up, you're essentially gambling that more often than not, the stock price will increase before it decreases.</p></li>
<li><p>It's dangerous to use any strategy that you haven't <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtesting"" rel=""nofollow"">backtested</a> extensively. Find several months or years of historical data, either intra-day or daily data, depending on the time frame you're using to trade, and simulate your strategy exactly. This helps you determine the potential profitability of your strategy, and it also forces you to decide on a plan for precisely <em>when</em> you want to invest. Do you invest as soon as the stock trades in a range (which algorithms can determine far better than intuition)? It also helps you figure out how to manage your risk and how much loss you're willing to accept. For risk management, using limit orders is a start, but see my point above about positively skewed prices. Limit orders aren't enough.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>In general, if an <em>active</em> investment strategy seems like a ""no-brainer"" or too good to be true, it's probably not viable.</strong> In general, as a retail investor, it's foolish to assume that no one else has thought of your simple active strategy to make easy money. I can promise you that someone <em>has</em> thought of it. Trading firms have quantitative researchers that are paid to think of and implement trading strategies <em>all the time</em>. 
If it's viable at any scale, they'll probably already have utilized it and arbitraged away the potential for small traders to make significant gains.</p>

<p>Trust me, you're not the first person who thought of using limit orders to make ""easy money"" off volatile stocks. The fact that you're asking here and doing research before implementing this strategy, however, means that you're on the right track. It's always wise to research a strategy extensively before deploying it in the wild.</p>

<hr>

<p>To answer the question in your title, since it could be interpreted a little differently than the body of the question: No, there's nothing wrong with investing in volatile stocks, indexes, etc. I certainly do, and I'm sure many others on this site do as well. It's not the <em>investing</em> that gets you into trouble and costs you a lot of money; it's the rapid buying and selling and attempting to time the market that proves costly, which is what you're doing when you implicitly bet that the distribution of the stock's prices is positively skewed.</p>

<h3>Update (In response to your edit:)</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>To address the commission fee problem, assuming a fee of $8 per trade ... and a minimum of $100 profit per sale</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Commissions aren't your only problem, and counting on $100 profit per sale is a <strong>significant</strong> assumption. Look at point #4 above. Through your use of limit orders, you're making the implicit assumption that, more often than not, the price will trigger your upper limit order <em>before</em> your lower limit order.</p>

<p>Here's a simple example; let's assume you have limit orders placed at +2 and -2 of your purchase price, and that triggering the limit order at +2 earns you $100 profit, while triggering the limit order at -2 incurs a loss of $100. Assume your commission is $5 on each trade. </p>

<p>If your upper limit order is triggered, you earn a profit of 100 - 10 = 90, then set up the same set of limit orders again. If your lower limit order is triggered this time, you incur a loss of 100 + 10 = 110, so your net gain is 90 - 110 = -20. This is a perfect example of why, when taking into account transaction costs, even strategies that at first glance seem profitable mathematically can actually fail. </p>

<p>If you set up the same situation again and incur a loss again (100 + 10 = 110), you're now down -20 - 110 = -130. To make a profit, you need to make two profitable trades, without incurring further losses. </p>

<p>This is why point #4 is so important. <strong>Whenever you trade, it's critical to completely understand the risk you're taking and the bet you're <em>actually</em> making, not just the bet you <em>think</em> you're making.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also, according to my ""algorithm"" a sale only takes place once the stock rises by 1 or 2 points; otherwise the stock is held until it does.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does this mean you've removed the lower limit order? If yes, then you expose yourself to downside risk. What if the stock has traded within a range, then suddenly starts declining because of bad earnings reports or systemic risks (to name a few)? If you haven't removed the lower limit order, then point #4 still stands. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, I never specified that the trades have to be done within the same day. </p>
  
  <p>Let the investor open up 5 brokerage accounts at 5 different firms (for safeguarding against being labeled a ""Pattern Day Trader"").</p>
  
  <p>Each account may only hold 1 security at any time, for the span of 1 business week.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How do you control how long the security is held? You're using limit orders, which will be triggered when the stock price hits a certain level, regardless of <em>when</em> that happens. Maybe that will happen within a week, or maybe it will happen within the same day. Once again, the bet you're actually making is different from the bet you <em>think</em> you're making.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can you provide some algorithms or methods that do work for generating some extra cash on the side, aside from purchasing S&amp;P 500 type index funds and waiting?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I purchase index funds, it's not to generate extra liquid cash on the side. I don't invest <em>nearly</em> enough to be able to purchase an index fund and earn substantial dividends.</p>

<p>I don't want to get into any specific strategies because I'm not in the business of making investment recommendations, and I don't want to start. Furthermore, I don't think explicit investment recommendations are welcome here (unless it's describing why something is a <em>bad</em> idea), and I agree with that policy. I will make a couple of points, however.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Understand your goals. Are you investing for retirement or a shorter horizon, e.g. some side income? You seem to know this already, but I include it for future readers. </p></li>
<li><p>If a strategy seems too good to be true, it probably is.</p></li>
<li><p>Educate yourself before designing a strategy. Research fundamental analysis, different types of orders (e.g., so you fully understand that you don't have control over when limit orders are executed), different sectors of the market if that's where your interests lie, etc. Personally, I find some sectors fascinating, so researching them thoroughly allows me to make informed investment decisions as well as learn about something that interests me.</p></li>
<li><p>Understand your limits. How much money are you willing to risk and possibly <em>lose</em>? Do you have a risk management strategy in place to prevent unexpected losses? What are the costs of the risk management itself?</p></li>
<li><p>Backtest, backtest, backtest. Ideally your backtesting and simulating should be identical to actual market conditions and incorporate all transaction costs and a wide range of historical data.</p></li>
<li><p>Get other opinions. Evaluate those opinions with the same critical eye as I and others have evaluated your proposed strategy.</p></li>

<p>Does the value of the car depreciate because it is last year's model, even though it has not been used? This year's model is 2015 which will become old in 4 months.</p>
","<p>Accounting principles aside, the way to think about depreciation is to ask ""what could I sell it for?"". The depreciation over a year is the difference between wht it's worth now and what it is worth in a year. Taking cars as an example, on the day you drive it off the dealer's lot it becomes a used car, and is worth less than a new car, so it depreciates quite a bit.</p>

<p>Assuming you are asking 'will my 2014 car be worth less in a year's time than a 2015 model bought at the same time', the answer is probably yes (unless it turns out that everyone hates the 2015 model). On the other hand, you should be able to get the 2014 model for less than the 2015 model; so the 2014 model may have depreciated less. </p>

Suppose this couple is not yet ready for marriage but they want to buy a house together. </p>

<p>Chances are only Clayton will get approved for a mortgage because he has income and credit. In this case can the title of the home still be held by both? </p>

<p>Would the lender (bank) have any reservations about this since a party not on the mortgage has ownership of the property?</p>
","<p>It is highly unlikely that this would be approved by a mortgage underwriter.  </p>

<p>When the bank gives a loan with a security interest in a property (a lien), they are protected - if the borrower does not repay the loan, the property can be foreclosed on and sold, and the lender is made whole for the amount of the loan that was not repaid.  </p>

<p>When two parties are listed on the deed, then each owns an UNDIVIDED 50% share in the property.  If only one party has pledged the property as surety against the loan, then in effect only 50% of the property is forecloseable.  This means that the bank is unable to recoup its loss.  </p>

<p>For a (fictional, highly simplified) concrete example, suppose that the house is worth $100,000 and Adam and Zoe are listed on the deed, but Adam is the borrower for a $100,000 mortgage.  Adam owes $100,000 and has an asset worth $50,000 (which he has pledged as security for the loan), while Zoe owes nothing and has an asset worth $50,000 (which is entirely unencumbered).  If Adam does not pay the mortgage, the bank would only be able to foreclose on his $50,000 half of the property, leaving them exposed to great risk.  </p>

<p>There are other legal and financial reasons, but overall I think you'll find it very difficult to locate a lender who is willing to take that kind of risk.  It's very complicated and there is absolutely no up-side.  </p>

"Where should I put my will so that it can be easily found when the time comes?","7241","","<p>This has been puzzling me for a while. What is the best place to keep a last will and testament so that it can easily be found and executed obviously without any help from me?</p>

<p>I've seen a lot of people suggest safety deposit boxes, but I've also seen people say those can't be opened until an executor is named (which is specified in the document itself), so that seems like a bad answer. Also, there are thousands of banks out there. How will anyone ever know which one I picked to store this important document?</p>

<p>I've also heard that giving a copy to my attorney or financial planner is an alternative, but I don't exactly keep either of those on retainer and the same problem exists as the bank. How would anyone find the right one even if they were looking?</p>

<p>As for family members, I don't know if I feel comfortable initiating the conversation of who is getting what prematurely. So giving them copies is undesirable too.</p>

<p>Is there some kind of service or agency where you can file this sort of thing that the courts will know to check as a matter of routine?</p>
","<p>In your will you name your executor[s]. When you write your will, talk with your executor (""are you willing to be my executor?""). Tell your executor where to find your will (""My will was done by such-and-such a lawyer, who has a copy""), even if you don't tell them what the contents of the will are. You might also have paper files which you keep at home (e.g. which list your bank accounts, have your tax returns for previous years, records of any real estate you own, etc). One of these files can be labelled (Last Will and Testament) and say where to find it (e.g. at the lawyer's, or at the bank, or wherever it is). Rules and laws about probate courts and advice about how to deal them are locale-specific (you could ask your lawyer about what your executor needs in order to be prepared). My experience is that the lawyer who writes your will will charge a single lump sum for that service, and then keep a copy of it for you (or for your executor) indefinitely after that without being 'on retainer'. The lawyer (or the lawyer's firm, if you outlive your lawyer) might be the executor; or a family member might be the executor, and hire a lawyer. A Texas will that I saw mentioned paying the executor's costs and/or fees from the estate. Also I think that there can be more than one copy of the will.</p>

"Is it a bad idea to buy a motorcycle with a lien on it?","7237","","<p>I was curious why is it considered a ""bad idea"" to purchase a motorcycle/vehicle with a lien on it? </p>

<p>It started when I came across an ad on Craigslist where I'm interested in buying a used vehicle. However, the seller mentioned that there is a lien on it. When I searched what a lien was, many people mentioned that it was a really bad idea to buy something with a lien on it, without going into too much detail why. </p>

<p>From what I understand so far, a lien is basically an asset that is owned by an individual but that individual still owes money to a lender. Why is this known to be a ""really bad"" or ""avoid at all cost"" type of deal (which was the general consensus)? Can't I ask how much there is left on the lien and negotiate that into the final price?</p>

<p>Update*: I purchased the bike. Pretty simple (so far), I went to the seller's credit union and paid the bike's lien with my cash. The bank clerk signed off the lien on the title and then the seller put my name on the title. I just need to take the title and change it to my name (I'm holding onto the original title and bike). Thanks to all who helped! </p>
","<p>In the case of a vehicle with a lien, there is a specific place on the title to have a lien holder listed, and the holder of the lien will also hold the title until the lien is cleared.</p>

<p>Usually this means you have to pay off the loan when you purchase the vehicle. If that loan is held by a bank, meet the seller at the bank and pay the loan directly with them and have them send the title directly to you when the loan is paid. This usually involves writing up a bill of sale to give to the bank when paying the loan.</p>

<p>The only thing you're trying to avoid here is paying cash to the seller--who then keeps the cash without paying the lien holder--who then keeps the title and repossesses the motorcycle. Don't pay the seller if they don't have the title ready to sign over to you.</p>

The article also claims that Clooney paid the taxes on all of it so his friends could accept the money tax-free.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The friend group, dubbed “The Boys,” reportedly helped support Clooney

  and offering additional support. The Ocean’s Eleven star said he
  wanted to let them know how important they were to him.</p>
  
  <p>As a kicker, Gerber added, Clooney said <strong>he also had paid the group’s taxes</strong>.</p>

<p>How is this possible?
First of all, how did Clooney know everyone's tax rate, and second of all, if he paid the taxes for them, isn't that an additional gift - incurring yet additional gift taxes?</p>
","<p>Clooney may have been confused or misquoted. </p>

<p>When he gives a friend a large gift, gift tax is owed. The giver pays this tax, not the recipient. Clooney would have been required to pay this tax. The gift is not considered income for the recipient, so it shouldn't impact their income taxes. </p>

<p>This is a little different then when, for example, Oprah gives all of her audience members a new car. In that case, the ""gift"" is considered a prize, which is a business expense for Oprah, but is considered income for the recipient, with income tax due. In that case, if Oprah wants the recipients to not have a tax burden, she needs to give additional cash to each recipient so that they can pay their taxes. </p>

"How do dividends of the underlying security in a security futures contract affect the security futures price?","7180","","<p>I would assume that increases in any dividends would increase the price of the underlying security, therefore causing a relative increase to the security future price. Or is this relationship more like that of interest rates and bond prices?</p>

<p>My textbook states that any dividend increase in the underlying security would cause a decrease relative to the price of the underlying stock. </p>

<p>Thanks in advance for your responses.</p>
","<p>The owner of a long futures contract does not receive dividends, hence this is a disadvantage compared to owning the underlying stock. If the dividend is increased, and the future price would not change, there is an arbitrage possibility.</p>

<p>For the sake of simplicity, assume that the stock suddenly starts paying a dividend, and that the risk free rate is zero (so interest does not play a role). One can expect that the future price is (rougly) equal to the stock price before the dividend announcment. If the future price would not change, an investor could buy the stock, and short a futures contract on the stock. At expiration he has to deliver the stock for the price set in the contract, which is under the assumptions here equal to the price he bought the stock for. But because he owned the stock, he receives the announced dividend. Hence he can make a risk-free profit consisting of the divivends.</p>

<p>If interest do play a role, the argument is similar.</p>

"Will a 7/1 ARM be better vs a 30yr fix rate for a mortgage if I am prepaying part of the principal every year","7169","","<p>I am a 1st time home buyer and I have just accepted a counter offer from a seller for a house that I like. The next step was to apply and get a mortgage for buying this house. Some background on the house and type of loans that I was offered by a lender:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>loan amt: ~200k</p></li>
<li><p>down payment: 15%</p></li>
<li><p>closing cost and any other fees paid in cash and not included in the loan amount.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>loan choices:</p>

<ol>
<li>7/1 ARM @ 3.5% with 5%/2%/5% for initial/periodic/lifetime rate caps
monthly payment ~929 (excl pmi, insurance, taxes, utilities, ...)
monthly prepayment 1.1k</li>
<li>4.75@30 yrs monthly payment ~1079 (excl pmi, insurance, taxes,
utilities, ...) monthly prepayment 1k</li>
</ol>

<p>I do not plan to stay in this house for more than 6-8 yrs (hopefully). Also, I am willing to prepay the loan by 1k every month, so eventually the interest that I pay out is very less.</p>

<p>My question is that, under these circumstances, is the 7/1 ARM a better option than the 30yr fixed? </p>

<p>If I do go with the 7/1, and due to different circumstances, I continue to stay in the same house, I would plan to refinance it as a 10yr fix, since by that time I would have paid more principal with the 7/1 than with the 30yr fixed.</p>

<p>Does this strategy make any financial sense?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
Thanks for all the suggestions and comments. The cautious me eventually won over the riskier me and I went along with the 30yr fixed. Also, another reason was that I got even better rate now that we have the upheaval about the downgrade going on.</p>
","<p>The big problem with ARM's is they can turn into traps.  If interest rates have gone up significantly in 7 years time, and especially if you are pushing things to the limit JUST to pay the mortgage, then you can find yourself stuck in a situation where you can't afford to refinance (because the rates are higher) and can't afford to pay the rising costs in an arm. So you might be forced into selling into a unfavorable market instead of having the option to hold and let the market recover. </p>

<p>Another nightmare scenario is if housing prices have fallen, and you can't refinance because the property is under-water and nobody will write a loan for more than the house is worth. You'd then be stuck paying higher payments on a property that is worth less.  (just set the wayback machine to say 2005 and imagine if you'd made a similar investment to what you are considering, with a plan to plan to sell in 6 years.)</p>

<p>In your case it seems you have ample cash flow to sustain an increase in the payments. So unless your income changes in that time, 'making the new payments' may not be a big risk for you. However being faced with higher interest rates than you'd have on a fixed may still be an issue. As could be the property being under-water value wise.</p>

<p>OTOH if you can afford to pay a larger amount, and plan to do so every month, you might want to just look at a shorter term fixed rate loan, which will have a lower interest rate than a standard 30 year loan would.  Because it doesn't take that much of an increase in principle payments to drastically shorten a loan, the payments on a 15 year loan may be lower than you'd expect.  (many folks just assume, due to bad math, that it will be twice as large a payment as a 30 year loan) </p>

<p>Personally, if you DO decide to go with the ARM, I'd suggest you strongly consider what your REAL cost (interest minus your tax deduction) of the money is, and if it would make more sense to be investing that extra each month somewhere else rather than only earning the effected few percent you'd get by prepaying on the loan.  Even with something fairly conservative like ladder of 5 year CD's or a Ginny=mae fund, you might be able to earn more than you'd be saving in interest. </p>

<p>With a fixed rate loan you know what your payments will look like in the future.  With an ARM you trade a lower rate now, for the risk of a substantially higher rate later. </p>

"Why might it be advisable to keep student debt vs. paying it off quickly?","7167","","<p>As of a couple weeks ago, I paid off all of my student debt. Hooray...</p>

<p>But I have a friend named A who has a friend named B who is a financial advisor (a young so therefore perhaps ignorantly malicious one). B has convinced A that he should take a very long time to pay off his student loans. </p>

<p>This makes no sense to me. Even if your money can be invested to produce value faster than your debt will accrue interest, there are still obvious problems. For example, if you lose your job, you're potentially in trouble. Any financial setback could turn into a terrible credit score. </p>

<p>Is there some reason somebody would and should willingly take a long time to pay off student debt and why?</p>
","<p>There are several ways you can get out of paying your student loans back in the USA:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You become disabled and the loan is dismissed once verified by
treating doctor or the Social Security Administration.</p></li>
<li><p>You become a peace officer.</p></li>
<li><p>You become a teacher; generally K-12, but I have heard from the DOE that
teachers at state schools qualify as well.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So the ""<em>malicious</em>"" friend B is prescribing to the theory that if one of those conditions becomes true, friend A will not have to pay back the loan. The longer you drag it out, the more chance you have to fulfill a condition. Given that 2 of these methods require a commitment, my guess is that they are thinking more along the lines of the first one, which is horrible.</p>

<p>Financially, it makes no sense to delay paying back your loans because deferred loans are only interest-free until you graduate and are past your grace period, after which they will begin accruing interest. Unsubsidized loans accrue interest from the day you get them, only their payback is deferred until you graduate and exhaust your grace period. Anytime you ask for forbearance, you are still accruing interest and it is capitalizing into your principal &mdash; you are just given a chance to delay payback due to financial hardship, bad health, or loss of job. Therefore, at no point are you benefiting beyond the time you are in school and getting an education, still looking for a job, or dealing with health issues.</p>

<p>In the current market, no CD, no savings account, and no investment will give you substantially more return that will offset the loss of the interest you are accruing. Even those of us in the old days getting 4.X % rates would not do this. There was a conditional consolidation offer the DOE allowed which could bring all your loans under one roof for a competitive 5.x-6.x % rate allowing you a single payment, but even then you would benefit if you had rates that were substantially higher. From a credit worthiness aspect, you are hurt by the outstanding obligation and any default along the way, so you really want to avoid that &mdash; paying off or down your loans are a good way to ensure you don't shoot yourself in the foot.</p>

"How can I avoid being fined or penalized because my accountant might have failed to file my taxes on time?","7164","","<p>I decided to use a CPA because my tax situation got complicated this year.  I have attempted to contact my accountant several times and cannot get a response from him at all.  It is now after the filing date, and I am concerned that he has failed to file my taxes and that I may now face some kind of penalty.</p>

<p>I feel that if he was unable to accomodate my taxes this year he should have communicated that to me so that I could have sought out an alternative means to filing my taxes properly.</p>

<p>So, my questions are:</p>

<p>First, what can I do about my tax situation?  Is it possible to avoid being fined or penalized?</p>

<p>Second, are CPAs held to some any kind of practicing or licensing laws?  If so, is there a complaint process?  Is it possible to hold him accountable for any fines or penalties that I might incur?</p>
","<p>Contact the IRS to see if your return has been filed.  If you can, try to obtain information on your CPA prior to calling, like the PTIN, CAF (if any), CPA number, etc.  It may be in other documents you've gotten from the CPA - particularly previously filed IRS documents.  The IRS has a process and <a href=""http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f14157.pdf""><strong>form</strong></a> for complaints against CPAs and preparers.</p>

<p>I would be careful not to do much against the CPA until your taxes are filed, either by this CPA or by another CPA (or preparer or by yourself).  If you're resolved to go somewhere else now, then pull that trigger and don't pay the CPA's bills until the full amount due is negotiated (presumably down to zero due).</p>

<p>You can ask for forgiveness from late penalties if you can show ""<a href=""http://www.irs.gov/uac/Newsroom/Eight-Facts-on-Late-Filing-and-Late-Payment-Penalties""><strong>reasonable cause</strong></a>"" for the lateness.  You can also freeze any interest from accruing by estimating and paying your taxes now through <a href=""https://www.eftps.gov/eftps/""><strong>eftps</strong></a>.</p>

<p>If the CPA has not told you an amount due, then there's good reason to believe the return was not filed.  However, if you had some arrangement or prior discussion of the amount due, then it may be possible that he submitted your taxes and attached a bank account payment number (did you provide him one?).</p>

<p>You really need to get in contact with the CPA to understand what's been done, if anything.  Try contacting other people in the enterprise, if there are any.  If you know other clients of the CPA, contact them.  If you were referred by friends or family, use them.  If you know where the office is, try going down there (be direct but never aggressive).</p>

<p>Remember to file a complaint with the IRS for ""preparer misconduct"" on Form 14157.  You can file compaints with the state board of accountancy or other responsible licensing agency (e.g. <a href=""http://www.dca.ca.gov/cba/consumers/complain.shtml""><strong>CA</strong></a>, <a href=""http://www.tsbpa.state.tx.us/enforcement/filing-complaint.html""><strong>TX</strong></a>, <a href=""http://www.nysscpa.org/page/public-ethics-resource-center""><strong>NY</strong></a>).  I believe <a href=""http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f843.pdf""><strong>Form 843</strong></a> is the appropriate form to request abatement of the late penalties (with brief explanatory attachment), but you can review the <a href=""http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i843.pdf""><strong>instructions</strong></a> and let your next CPA consider it.</p>

"In the donut hole of assistance, Should I buy a home?","7155","","<p>I heard that there are a ton of credits and assistance for my county/state for first time home buyers, so I started to casually look at the assistance programs. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, because I would be living with my (unmarried) partner, we make barely too much combined to qualify for most of state and county assistance programs. I think the only program we qualify for is Pennsylvania's closing costs loan.</p>

<p>I net 70k, gross ~60k last year. Partner grossed ~40k last year. We both have 700+ credit scores and no credit card dept. Rent is currently $1,345. My partner's finances mostly break even, even with me footing ~75% of rent, foot, etc; though I still save $200-400/mo for a down payment.</p>

<p>Between us I could wrangle a ~$20k down payment from our savings. If a PA loan can cover closing costs, I hope to keep some of the savings for actual moving costs and initial home improvements (painting, carpeting, etc).</p>

<p>So my questions are: </p>

<p>How much home is realistic for me? I was looking at around $250k, or monthly payments around $900. Would it make sense for taxes or assistance programs to formally get a marriage license or domestic partnership?</p>

<p>I also have an unusual arrangement with my parents where I pay $500 a month for the student loans they co-signed. Its a big expense for me, without the tax advantages, since I'm just sending money to my parents bank account. Is this going to come up in the loan application process?</p>
","<p>You're making $100k together per year: you're not in the donut hole, you're in the <a href=""http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_14_5YR_S1901&amp;prodType=table"">top 25%</a> of all households, and the top 10% of non-family households (as yours would be).  To be blunt, you're not in the ""rely on assistance"" area: you're in the ""save up for your downpayment"" sector.</p>

<p>My suggestion would be to figure out a way to save more than $200-$400 a month for now.  $100k gross income means you have about $8k net income per month; $2k for rent and other necessities means you have $6k <em>per month</em> that you can potentially save.  Even half of that - $3k per month - means you have $24000 saved by the end of this year, and $36000 on an annual basis.</p>

<p>As far as marriage or domestic partnership - I wouldn't get into one based on whether it helps you afford a home.  It might be a good idea because it helps you handle some of the details arising when you have joint property, perhaps, but not solely for the financial aspect.</p>

<p>And as far as how much home is realistic?  $250k is certainly realistic if you can save up enough for a good down payment.  Try to get to the 20-25% range.  If you're already halfway there, another year of renting won't kill you, and it will mean no PMI and much better rates.  </p>

<p>Also consider a 15 year mortgage; we're in the same general income category as you and manage a 15 year on a $250k range house quite nicely.  It doesn't add all that much to your monthly payment amount, compared to what you'd expect - particularly since the monthly payment includes property taxes which won't increase based on the length of the mortgage.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now that we have actual numbers from the OP:</p>

<pre><code>$5000 actual paycheck income (post-tax, health insurance, 401k)
-$1345 Rent
-$ 710 Student Loans
-$ 300 Car Payment
-$ 100 Car Insurance
-$ 140 Cable TV
-$  90 Cell Phone
-$ 300 Food/Groceries
-----------------------
 $2025 Remaining
</code></pre>

<p>So, without cutting anything, you have $2k yourself you can be saving.  (This assumes your rent number of $1345 is your portion of rent, and not the 100% amount.)  That's $24000 per year, just by yourself.  On top of that, you've got another $40k or so coming from your partner, at least some of which should be available as well if he/she is going to be co-owning?  But if not, at least you have about $2000 a month you can be saving.  You could also downsize the car, cut cable TV, downsize the phone, and have another $500 or so available - but it doesn't really look like you need to do that, given how much you have available now.</p>

<p>I'd look at what you're doing with that ~$2000 per month right now, and see how you can free most of it up.  You haven't mentioned a few things like utilities, not sure if that's just forgetfulness or if your partner is paying them; so perhaps not all of it is available.  But - even $1000 a month is $12000 to add to the $20000 you have now, which makes a big dent in that down payment.</p>

It seems that if there is a low-volume stock, even with significant daily swings in stock price (e.g. 10-15%), one really can't take advantage of that to make any significant amount of money.  In the previous post, I outlined a naive trade intended to make $1,000 off a $10k buy, but it was shown this would likely fail, even if the stock price <em>would have</em> increased by 10% had I not placed the trade.  Another way to state this is that my trade would disrupt the stock price, and not in my favor at all.</p>

<p>So, that means I'd have to settle for a smaller trade.  If I bought $100 worth of the stock, that size of a buy wouldn't be too disruptive.  I might succeed and get $10 out of the trade (10% of $100).  But my trade fee was $8 or so, so I only made $2 on this trade, despite the stock price changing by 10%, which is very high.  I'd have to repeat this process 25,000x/yr in order to make $50k/year as a swing trader in this way.  Maybe with computers I could do that, but it seems unlikely.</p>

<p>So, I would think there is some middle number between $100 and $10k that will produce a better return.  However, I've shown that I cannot expect to get $1,000/trade.  Probably not even $500/trade.  So let's say I can make $200/trade.  I'd still have to do this 250x/yr to make $50k/yr swing trading.  That's about 5x/week, with no losses.  Totally unrealistic.</p>

<p><strong>Does anyone make significant money trading low volume stocks?</strong>  I'm not sure this is the case - I've never heard of a hedge fund trading in the pink sheets, for example.</p>

<p>Second, if your assumption is valid, here are a few ideas how it might work:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Accumulate slowly, exit slowly</strong>.  This won't work for short-term swings, but if you feel like a low-volume stock will be a longer-term winner, you can accumulate a sizable portion in small enough chunks not to swing the price (and then slowly unwind your position when the price has increased sufficiently).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Create additional buyers/sellers.</strong>  Your frustration may be one of the reasons low-volume stock is so full of scammers pumping and dumping (read any investing message board to see examples of this).  If you can scare holders of the stock into selling, you can buy significant portions without driving the stock price up.  Similarly, if you can convince people to buy the stock, you can unload without destroying the price.  This is (of course) morally and legally dubious, so I would not recommend this practice.</p></li>

"Charging the company I work for to rent from myself","7146","","<p>I have a Vacation Rental By Owner (VRBO) rental in a city that the company I work for (large company - W2) requires I travel to regularly. I am authorized to use either hotels or VRBO/AirB&amp;B rentals when I travel.</p>

<p>Is there any financial / tax reason NOT to stay at my own VRBO rental? Any negative I'm not thinking of?</p>

<p>I have not told them it's mine, and I see no reason to as it's owned under my company name / not myself directly and managed solely (along with other rentals) by my spouse. I only plan to rent it to them when: 1) I can rent it to them cheaper than a local hotel and 2) it's already vacant.</p>
","<p>Your biggest problem is that this may be seen as a <strong>conflict of interest</strong> - in other words there is potential for you to make decisions about company money that benefit <em>you</em>, rather than the company. Fortunately <strong>it's not a very big problem, handled rightly.</strong></p>

<p>In order to prevent any possibility that this might be a problem, I
    recommend that you:</p>

<ol>
<li>Go and tell whoever approves your travel expenses
about the arrangement. Be up front that the place you are staying is
yours. (That it is technically run by your wife will make no
difference.) You might need to come with evidence that you aren't
overcharging, i.e. rates of other places you might stay, but they probably know the rates in this city pretty well. However note that they will be comparing prices at other places you might reasonably stay, not necessarily places with the same facilities.</li>
<li>Get a written statement that they are OK with the arrangement, and that they are OK with the price you are charging. If you really are cheaper than the local hotels they will probably be OK with it. Getting their agreement removes any possibility that you are trying to do something shady.</li>
</ol>

<p>People have been fired for trying to rip off their companies through deals like this, but if you are up front about everything and aren't overcharging there shouldn't be a problem. And this is likely not a big enough amount of money to be a real problem anyway.</p>

<p>I don't see any tax issues in this. However check with the company that there might not be some more tax efficient way of doing things.</p>

"Can I do a Roth 401k rollover to Roth IRA and withdraw contributions I've made this year?","7146","","<p><strong>I am leaving my current job. Can I do a rollover from my existing Roth 401k, to a Roth IRA, and then withdraw my contributions and vested employer contributions from this year and stick them into a savings account <em>without penalties</em>?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Extra context for those who are curious</strong>: I live in a major metropolitan area and have received an excellent job offer in a rural area with a low cost of living.  That being said, I just bought a place last year in a great neighborhood in the metro area for dirt cheap (Mortgage + PITI + HOA fees + Utils are around $750/mo).  I have a private buyer lined up and can at least recover the money I put in, but would like to hold on to it as a vacation and possibly rental property.  But over the past year, in addition to buying this place I also bought a car and remodeled the bathroom, so my cash reserves are much lighter than I feel they should be.  So I'm looking for creative ways to beef up my savings account without selling, hence rolling over to Roth IRA and trying to get my contributions back.</p>
","<p>According to <a href=""http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p4530.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">IRS Pub 4530</a>, there are two (potential) problems with doing what you suggest. </p>

<p>First, the employer contribution is pre-tax, and is treated just like a normal 401(k) contribution. </p>

<p>Second, unless you meet the usual criteria for distribution (age or disability), some of the distribution would be subject to income tax. That would be the case if the value of the account exceeds the elected contribution amount. For example, if the account is worth 25% more than the contributed amount, the basis of the withdrawal would be 1/1.25 = 0.80 (or 80%) of the amount, and hence you'd pay income tax on 20% of the distribution.</p>

<p>Edited to add:</p>

<p>It would seem that the second problem above is only applicable for non-qualified direct distributions from the 401(k). After a little more research, I found an IRS FAQ on <a href=""http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/Retirement-Plans-FAQs-on-Designated-Roth-Accounts#rollovers"" rel=""nofollow"">Designated Roth Account Rollovers</a>. It appears from example 1 in the linked section that you <em>can</em> do what you propose, as long what you withhold from the rollover is less than the amount of the designated contribution. (It's an interesting loophole that contributions to the Roth 401(k) are irrevocable until you roll them over to a Roth IRA, at which point you're subject to the more lenient IRA rules.)</p>

<p>Not usually a good idea to touch retirement funds. Just pay your savings account from your new paychecks for a while to rebuild your cash cushion.</p>

<p>I reside in the State of Nebraska.</p>
","<p>If the employer provides housing to the employee, the <strong>employer</strong> has to identify whether it is taxable or not. If it is - the amounts would be added to the taxable income on your W2. All the withholding and FICA tax calculations will be performed based on that taxable income. If the employer fails to do that, and you get audited, you can be left on the hook for the unpaid taxes on the unreported income.</p>

<p>In some cases, employee housing is a non-taxable fringe benefit, in others it is taxable. Your tax adviser will help identify which case applies to you.</p>

"Are savings counted as part of expenses in a personal budget?","7103","","<p>When I budget for me, I usually count savings part of the expenses.</p>

<p><strong>Is it the correct way to do it?</strong> Because of this, when I look at my budget at the end of the month, it feels like my expenses are a bit high.</p>
","<p>I have found it useful to have four (yes, four) categories in a budget, rather than the traditional two (income and expenses). This may not be the ""correct"" way to do it, but it makes sense to me.</p>

<p>First, <strong>income</strong>. This one is a no-brainer and is needed in any budget. In this scheme income also includes money taken out of deferred-spending savings (see below). I don't consider money taken out of savings ""income"", however.</p>

<p>Second, <strong>expenses</strong>. This is the money you actually <em>spent</em> in the given period (month, with most budgets, but if you are paid on a different schedule it may be bi-weekly, quarterly, or whatever else makes sense in your particular situation). Plain and simple whatever goes into ""expenses"" is money that is no longer available to you in any way shape or form. I'd put credit card spending into this category as well (treat it the same as debit card spending) but as long as you aren't carrying a balance, that's simply a matter of taste. I'd also put loan payments into this category since ""getting the money back"" then means taking out a new loan.</p>

<p>Third, <strong>deferred spending</strong>. This category is for setting money aside for big-ticket items that you know are coming and which you either aren't sure exactly when they will turn into real expenses (money spent), or know when they will and they are simply too large to handle comfortably with the day-to-day cash flow. An example of the former might be a new car fund, and the latter might be something like my buying dog food about once every four months; the cost for such a batch is too large to handle comfortably within a single month's budget without making large adjustments elsewhere, so I set money aside each month and then use it every four months (or thereabouts). In this categorization, <em>setting the money aside</em> classifies as deferred spending, and <em>taking it back out</em> classifies as income. If done right, this category will trend toward zero over time, but may hold a substantial balance at times and will rarely or never actually <em>be at</em> zero. When you are just starting out, it may very well be negative unless you compensate by taking money from elsewhere. Note that some may refer to this category as targeted savings, which to me certainly is an overlapping term but does not carry quite the same meaning.</p>

<p>Fourth, <strong>savings</strong>. This is long term savings and investments that are not earmarked for a particular purpose or the purpose for which it is earmarked is very far into the future. How you define ""particular purpose"" and ""very far into the future"" are really a matter of definition, here, and you will have to come up with distinctions that work for you. <strong>The point is</strong> to separate saving for the future (savings) from saving to cover upcoming expenses <em>that you have already decided on or committed to</em> (deferred spending).</p>

<p>The deferred spending and savings categories can be further subdivided in much the same way as income and expenses, so you can keep track of the money going into your ""new car"" fund and your ""travelling around the world"" fund separately. The actual place where the money ends up is on your balance sheet, not the budget. (If you really want to keep track of your money, you will need both.)</p>

<p>In the end, the budget's bottom line becomes <strong>(income + money out of deferred spending) - (expenses + money into deferred spending + savings)</strong>. Just like a regular income/expenses budget, this will be zero if your budget is balanced.</p>

","<p>In short - if you can't get the job without incorporating, then incorporate!</p>

<p>Some clients will require you to be incorporated (which is why I did it 10 years ago).  Essentially, for them, it's a way of distancing themselves from you to ensure they are not responsible for any monies if you don't pay your taxes.

<p>For Ontario you can start here:
<a href=""http://www.ontario.ca/en/services_for_business/index.htm"">http://www.ontario.ca/en/services_for_business/index.htm</a></p>

<p>At a high level, there are some costs for being incorporated, and some tax savings.  At a minimum, costs would include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Incorporation costs - from memory this is a few hundred dollars</li>
<li>Name Search around $50 (you are not required to pick a name, and can simply use the numbered company from the incorporation, so this is optional)</li>
<li>Bank Account in the business's name (RBC is good for new companies as they have the lowest charges currently - see <a href=""http://www.redflagdeals.com"">http://www.redflagdeals.com</a> forums for a more indepth  discussion.</li>

<p>You may need the help of an account to help set things up, but it's quite easy to maintain all the records, etc that are required.  </p>

<p>Some other minor things I enjoy are writing myself expense cheques so that I get money back immediately (and effectively only pay 60% of the cost after writing it off in the company). I can decide how much to pay myself and push income from year to year.</p>

"Alternatives to Intuit's PayTrust service for online bill viewing and bill payment?","7098","","<p>I've been a long-time user of <a href=""http://www.paytrust.com"">PayTrust</a>. The idea behind the service is great: I can receive bills through PayTrust, view them online and set up payment rules to pay them automatically. However, Intuit (its parent company) has allowed the service to decay to the point where it has become simply unbearable: e-bill retrieval fails silently, paper bills are wrongly assigned (or not at all), the system fails to follow payment rules. I've had enough, and I'm cancelling my PayTrust account.</p>

<p>What are my alternatives?</p>

<p>So far, I see these options:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Billpay through my bank</strong>: It's free, but it doesn't receive bills for me. I would have to go to the payee's websites each month to find out how much I owe, or I would have to receive paper bills in the mail (something I definitely don't want). My bank does support e-bills; however, none of my payees are on their list. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Auto-pay through the payees</strong>: Many payees, especially credit card companies, offer a service to debit my checking account automatically each month. I don't feel comfortable with this option. I'm concerned that I lose leverage in the event of fraud or a merchant dispute.  Since the payees already have my money (via a direct debit authorization), they're less inclined to resolve a billing dispute.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I'm looking for a way to pay bills automatically, but in a way that still allows me to intercede in the event of fraud. In essence, a service that tells me that I received a bill for $1,000 from my MasterCard on the 5th, and if I take no further action, it will be automatically paid from my checking account on the 20th -- just what PayTrust does today, but in a reliable way.</p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>
","<p>Ally bank has a free billpay service where you have the option of paying bills via eBills.</p>

<p>From Ally's site:</p>

<p>What are eBills?
An eBill is an online version of a bill or statement that can replace a traditional paper copy. Many large companies, like your electric, phone, cable and major credit card companies have the ability to send you eBills.</p>

","<h3>Growth phase</h3>

<p>When you're estimating how much you'll have saved at retirement, subtract the average rate of inflation from your estimate of how much your savings will grow each year. For example, if you expect your retirement account to grow at 8% a year, and you expect inflation to be 3% each year, use 5% as the estimated growth rate instead of 8%.</p>

<h3>Withdrawal phase</h3>

<p>Once you reach retirement, <em>add</em> an estimate for the inflation rate to your annual withdrawal rate. For example, say you've reached retirement with $1 million. If you expect to withdraw 4% each year, but you expect inflation to average 1% each year after you retire, plan on withdrawing 5% a year instead of 4%.</p>

<p>This lets you adjust for the decrease in the purchasing power of your money. For example, you may spend $40K/year to maintain your current lifestyle.

I have never charged amounts to my card where I have a balance due at the end of my billing cycle, so I have never paid any interest/always have the card paid in full.</p>

<p>I did not want to get a credit card but realized I needed to build my credit score somehow, so I got this one. I am used to paying everything in cash (which I still do for the most part). I found this method easiest for me because I do not need to keep track of my purchases or when payment is due.</p>

<ol>
<li>Am I building a credit score using my credit card this way?</li>
<li>Is this helping/hindering my goal of establishing credit?</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I mistakenly misused positive balance for negative balance. 
It appears I am using 0% utilization of my available credit.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 3/2017:</strong> Coming back here to update for any future readers.</p>

<p>My original question was asked because of my reluctance to use a credit card, and ignorance of what 'good credit card usage' habit really is. I was confused to when you have to pay your balance, how much you have to pay, and what the interest rules were. I basically did not understand any of this and made a plan to pay the card in full before using it.</p>

<p>In hindsight, I agree with the sentiment from the responses below: this was wasted effort. I went the long way around using a credit card because I did not know how everything worked! Wasted effort borne from ignorance.</p>

<p>If you are using a credit card as a debit card, and are wondering what are the effects on your credit score, you are doing the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Payment On Time - GOOD</li>
<li>Credit Card Utilization 0% - BAD</li>
<li>Credit History - GOOD</li>
</ol>

<p>I have an approximate credit score of right under 770. I spent 4 years with 1 credit card and no other form of debt. I have paid in full every month and have paid $0.00 in interest for the history of my account. At this phase in my life, I now have multiple lines of credit (student, auto) and am considering getting a second credit card to diversify my credit history.</p>
","<p>I strongly suggest you look at <a href=""http://CreditKarma.com"" rel=""nofollow"">CreditKarma</a> and see how each aspect of what you are doing impacts your score. Here's my take -</p>

<ol>
<li>Active account - Good</li>
<li>Zero Balance/Utilization - Actually bad</li>
<li>Building length of credit history - Good</li>
<li>On time payment history - Good</li>
<li>Credit score requests - Good (as you appear to not be applying for more accounts. The credit requests falls off after 2 years)</li>
</ol>

<p>There's an anti-credit approach that many have which, to me, is over the top. ""Zero cards, zero credit"" feels to me like one step shy of ""off the grid."" It's so far to the right that it actually is more of an effort than just playing the game a bit. You are depositing to the card frequently to do what you are doing. That takes time and effort. Why not just pay the bill in full each month, and just track purchases so you move the cash to the account in advance, whether that's physical or on paper? 
In your case, it's the same as charging one item every few months to keep the card active. If that's what you'd like to do, that's fine. I'd just avoid having the card take up too much of your time and thought. </p>

<p>(Disclaimer - I've used and written about Credit Karma. I have no business relationship with them, my articles are to help readers, and not paid placement.)</p>

<p>mhoran's response is in line with my thinking. His advice to use the card to build your score is what the zero-credit folk criticize as ""a great debt score."" Nonsense. If you use debt wisely, you'll never pay interest (except for a mortgage, perhaps) and you may gain rewards with no cost to you. </p>

","<p>No, futures do not carry a premium. The premium on an option contract exists because the rights and obligations of the parties involved are not equivalent. On an option, one party has an obligation while the other party has a right to buy or sell at a price (with no obligation to do so). This difference in obligation is why the side that sells the contract receives the premium while the side that buys the contract pays it.

<p>2) Pay Strong attention to Taxes! You can't predict most things, but you CAN predict what you'll have to pay in taxes, it's one of the few known quantities.  Be smart and trade so you pay as little in taxes as possible </p>

<p>2A)If you live someplace where taxes on Long term gains are lower than short term (like the USA) then try really really hard to hold 'winners' till they are long term.  Even if the price falls a little, you might be up in the net compared to paying out an extra 10% or more in taxes on your gains.  Obviously there's a balancing act there between when you feel something is 'done' and the time till it's long term.. but if you've held something for 11 months, or 11 months and 2 weeks, odds are you'd be better off to hold till the one year point and then sell it. 
 2B) Capture Losses when you have them by selling and buying a similar stock for a month or something.  (beware the wash sale rule) to use to offset gains. </p>

","<p>Most of the gold prices at international markets are USD denominated. Hence the prices would be same in international markets where large players are buying and selling.<br>
However this does not mean that the prices to the individuals in local markets is same. The difference is due to multiple things like cost of physical delivery, warehousing, local taxation, conversion of Local currency to USD etc.<br>
So in essence the price of Gold is similar to price of Crude Oil. The price of Oil is more or less same on all the markets exchanges, though there is small difference this is because of the cost of delivery/shipment which is borne by the buyer.<br>
However the cost of Oil to retail individual varies from country to country.</p>

"I am failing to see the purpose of a Traditional IRA for someone who already has access to a 401(k)","7025","","<p>If I understand correctly, the Traditional IRA, if you have 401k with an employer already, has the following features per <a href=""https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/2017-ira-deduction-limits-effect-of-modified-agi-on-deduction-if-you-are-covered-by-a-retirement-plan-at-work"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">IRS</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Your contributions are taxed</li>
<li>Your contributions are NOT taxed upon withdrawals.</li>
<li>Your earnings are taxed upon withdrawals.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you do not have an employer 401k or your income qualifies, the time at which you are taxed switches per IRS <a href=""https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/2017-ira-deduction-limits-effect-of-modified-agi-on-deduction-if-you-are-not-covered-by-a-retirement-plan-at-work"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">documentation</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Your contributions are pre-tax, e.g. not taxed.</li>
<li>Your contributions are taxed upon withdrawals.</li>
<li>Your earnings are taxed upon withdrawals.</li>
</ol>

<p>So you are paying taxes on your contributions regardless, the timing is just different.  </p>

<p>I am failing to see why would a person get an IRA, instead of just putting the same amount of money into a mutual fund (like Vanguard) or something like that.  </p>

<p>What am I missing?</p>
","<p>To keep it simple, I will keep the focus between a Trad IRA and a normal Taxable account (Roth's and 401(k) add more complications that make another problem). </p>

<p>I will also assume, based on the question, that you aren't able to deduct the IRA contributions. Also, a Roth is better in every way than a non-deductible Trad IRA so the ""backdoor Roth"" mentioned in other answers is probably the way to go and this is more of an academic exercise. </p>

<p>Ok, so why bother with the IRA if you're taxed anyway? </p>

<p>Because you aren't taxed as you go!</p>

<p>With a normal non-tax-advantaged account you have to pay taxes every year on any realized capital gains and dividends (including fund distributions). Because of the compounding nature of savings, delaying paying taxes is in your best interest. </p>

<p>Simple example: </p>

<ul>
<li>$1000/yr investment for 35 years   </li>
<li>15% taxes on all gains and investment income (yes, it's really much
more complicated, but I'm feeling lazy...)  </li>
<li>15% taxes on IRA earnings upon withdrawal. (also more complicated depending on other income sources and ""working through the tax brackets"")</li>
<li>5% investment growth (conservative, but again, I'm lazy)</li>
</ul>

<p>Taxable Account:</p>

<ul>
<li>Final Balance: $77,459</li>
<li>Taxes owed: $0 (you paid as you went)</li>
</ul>

<p>IRA Account:</p>

<ul>
<li>Final Balance: $90,320</li>
<li>Earnings: $55,320</li>
<li>Taxes owed: $8,298</li>
<li>Net Balance: $82,022</li>
<li>IRA Advantage: $4,562</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, this is a very simplified example. If you're more tax-conscious (i.e. more buy-and-holding), you can delay paying some of the long-term cap gains in the taxable account, but any short-term cap gains (including distributions from the underlying funds) will be at your marginal income tax rate. </p>

<p>A few other observations:</p>

<ul>
<li>The longer the time horizon, the greater the IRA advantage (in the above example, after 10 years, the difference is less than $45)</li>
<li>The greater the expected return on investment, the better the IRA route performs</li>
<li>Higher tax rate = more advantage for the IRA</li>
<li>If you'll be paying a higher tax on the withdrawal than the gains in the taxable account, the taxable account may be better</li>
<li>You can deduct losses in the taxable account, reducing some of the yearly tax pain. </li>
<li>It really depends on a lot of factors that will vary considerably person to person and situation to situation. Hope you have a good crystal ball. ;)</li>
</ul>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>I set up a spreadsheet where each year I deposited $1000 for 35 years. Each year, the balance in the IRA account grows by 5%, but the taxable only by 5%*(1-0.15) = 4.25% due to the effect of taxes. At the end of 35 years, my simulation assumes you pay 15% on all the gains in the IRA, which would likely not be the case, but easier than forecasting through retirement and demonstrates what I'm trying to show. Here's plot showing the balance in the various accounts, the blue is the IRA account, orange the taxable account, and grey is the effective balance of the IRA, after paying taxes on the gains: </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/effmU.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/effmU.png"" alt=""IRAvTax""></a></p>

<p>And here's a plot of the advantage of the IRA (after paying taxes on the gains), vs the taxable account:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BwSkW.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BwSkW.png"" alt=""IRAAdv""></a></p>

<p>Whether that's worth it to you or anyone depends on some the assumptions in the simulation, especially effective tax rates, and growth rates, as well as any personal issues. Some people may be less likely to raid an IRA account, for example, than a normal account. Conversely, if you have a project coming up, you may need something a bit more liquid than an IRA. </p>

"Why can't I short a stock that sells for less than $5? Is there another way to ""go short"" on them?","7012","","<p>I don't like satellite radio as a business and I want to short Sirius (SIRI).</p>

<p>The stock sells for less than $5, so my broker won't let me short it.</p>

<p>Is this a limitation of my broker? Or some SEC rule?</p>

<p>Are there funds that bundle up shares of companies like SIRI that I could short instead? Or are options the best way here?</p>
","<p>I think George's answer explains fairly well <em>why</em> the brokerages don't allow this - it's not an exchange rule, it's just that the brokerage has to <em>have the shares to lend</em>, and normally those shares come from people's margin, which is impossible on a non-marginable stock.</p>

<p>To address the question of what the alternatives are, on popular stocks like SIRI, a deep In-The-Money put is a fairly accurate emulation of an actual short interest.  If you look at the <a href=""http://quote.morningstar.com/Option/Options.aspx?ticker=SIRI"">options on SIRI</a> you will see that a $3 (or higher) put has a delta of -$1, which is the same delta as an actual short share.</p>

<p>You also don't have to worry about problems like margin calls when buying options.  The only thing you have to worry about is the expiration date, which isn't generally a major issue if you're buying in-the-money options... unless you're <em>very</em> wrong about the direction of the stock, in which case you could lose everything, but that's always a risk with penny stocks no matter how you trade them.</p>

<p>At least with a put option, the maximum amount you can lose is whatever you spent on the contract.  With a short sale, a bull rush on the stock could potentially wipe out your entire margin.  That's why, when betting on downward motion in a microcap or penny stock, I actually prefer to use options.  Just be aware that option contracts can generally only move in increments of $0.05, and that your brokerage will probably impose a bid-ask spread of up to $0.10, so the share price has to move down at least 10 cents (or 10% on a roughly $1 stock like SIRI) for you to just <em>break even</em>; definitely don't attempt to use this as a day-trading tool and go for longer expirations if you can.</p>

"When are payroll taxes due in the US?","7003","","<p>What are the rules surrounding when to make payroll tax payments for small businesses with 1 or 2 employees?  </p>
","<p>It depends on the size of the payroll, not on the number of employees.  Probably you need to file Form 941 quarterly under this scenario.  You may or may not need to deposit taxes more frequently.  If you must deposit, then you need to do it electronically.</p>

<p>I excerpted this from the instructions for Form 941:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If your total taxes (line 10) are less than $2,500 for
  the current quarter or the preceding quarter, and you
  did not incur a $100,000 next-day deposit obligation
  during the current quarter. You do not have to make a deposit. To avoid a penalty, you must pay the amount in full with a timely filed return or you must deposit the amount timely. ... If you are not sure your total tax liability for the current quarter will be less than $2,500 (and your liability for the preceding quarter was not less than $2,500), make deposits using the semiweekly or monthly rules so you won't be subject to failure to deposit penalties.</p>
  
  <p>If your total taxes (line 10) are $2,500 or more for the
  current quarter and the preceding quarter.  You must
  make deposits according to your deposit schedule. See
  section 11 of Pub. 15 (Circular E) for information and rules
  about federal tax deposits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would say that <em>probably</em> for two employees, you need to deposit by the 15th of each month for the prior month, but <em>you really need to check the limits above and the deposit schedule in Pub 15 (as referenced above) based on your actual payroll size.</em></p>

<p>Note that if you have a requirement to deposit, that must be done either through EFTPS or by wire-transfer.  The former is free but requires registration in advance of your first payment (they snail-mail you a PIN that you need to log-in) and it requires that you get your payment in by the night before.  The latter does not incur a charge from the IRS, but your bank will likely charge you a fee.  You can do the wire-transfer on the due date, however, so it's handy if don't get into ETFPS in time.</p>

<p>This is all for federal.  You may also need to deposit for your state, and then you'll need to check the state's rules.</p>

<p>What sort of indicators should I be looking for to evaluate if my rate of return is better or worse than average for the market I am in?  What is the best way to make that evaluation while considering my tolerance for risk?  Is there a general formula or research site I can use?</p>
","<p>A good way to measure the performance of your investments is <strong>over the long term</strong>.</p>

<p>25-30% returns are easy to get! It's not going to be 25-30% in a single year, though. You shouldn't expect more than about 4% real (inflation-adjusted) return per year, on average, over the long term, unless you have reason to believe that you're doing a better job of predicting the market than the intellectual and investment might of Wall Street - which is possible, but hard. <em>(Pro tip: It's actually quite easy to outdo the market at large over the short term just by getting lucky or investing in risky askets in a good year. Earning this sort of return consistently over many years, though, is stupidly hard. Usually you'll wipe out your gains several years into the process, instead.)</em></p>

<p>The stock market fluctuates like crazy, which is why they tell you not to invest any money you're likely to need sooner than about 5 years out and you switch your portfolio from stocks to bonds as you approach and enter retirement.</p>

<p>The traditional benchmark for comparison, as others have mentioned, is the rate of return (including dividends) from the <strong>Standard and Poors 500 Index</strong>. These are large stable companies which make up the core of larger United States business.

"Do Americans really use checks that often?","6962","","<p>That might sound a bit silly to people from USA but is it really that common to use checks in America?</p>

<p>I am from Austria and here (Austria, Germany, Switzerland) checks play practically no role in daily life. I haven't actually held a single check in my hands in my entire life.</p>

<p>So is it really common to get a paycheck in the sense that you get a piece of paper?</p>

<p>It would be nice if someone could explain the practice of ""money handling"" in America a little bit because I think it's really interesting how different cultures can be regarding money. </p>

<p>And I also have had the experience that most people believe that how it's done here, it's done in the whole world. :)</p>

<p>Edit: </p>

<p>I think it would only be fair if I just explain briefly how it is handled here. Maybe it's interesting to other people.</p>

<p>You usually have an account at your bank. Your payment as an employee is deposited there once a month. From there you can transfer money to other accounts. So instead of paying a bill by sending a check to the one getting the money you will send a form to your bank (or more commonly you will just go to the bank) ordering them to transfer money to the account of the other person.</p>

<p>Bills (esp. regular ones) are most often payed by issuing an ""Einzugsermächtigung"" (collection authorisation) and the companies will more or less just ""take"" the money from your account.</p>

<p>Today most people with a computer issue the transfer of money through the internet. </p>
","<p>When you start at a new job here in the U.S., the <em>default</em> means of payment is usually a paper check. Most folks will quickly set up direct deposit so that their employer deposits their paycheck directly into their personal bank account - the incentive to do so is that you receive your funds faster than if you deposit a paper check.  Even if you set up direct deposit on your first day on the job, you may still receive your first paycheck as a paper check simply because the wheels of payroll processing turn slowly at some (large) companies.</p>

<p>A counter example is a self-employed contractor - perhaps a carpenter or house painter.  These folks are paid by their customers, homeowners and such.  Many larger, well established contracters now accept credit card payments from customers, but smaller independents may be reluctant to set up a credit card merchant account to accept payment by card because of all the fees that are associated with accepting credit card payments.  3% transaction fees and monthly service fees can be scary to any businessman who already has very thin profit margins.  In such cases, these contractors prefer to be paid by check or in cash for the simple reason that there are no fees deducted from cash payments.</p>

<p>There are a few folks here who don't trust direct deposit, or more specifically, don't trust their employer to perform the deposit correctly and on time.  Some feel uncomfortable giving their bank info to their employer, fearing someone at the company could steal money from their account. In my experience, the folks who prefer a paper paycheck are often the same folks who rush to the bank on payday to redeem their paychecks for cash.  They may have a bank account (helps with check cashing) but they prefer to carry cash.</p>

<p>I operate in a manner similar to you - I use a debit card or credit card (I only have one of each) for nearly all transactions in daily life, I use electronic payments through my bank to pay my regular bills and mortgage, and I receive my paycheck by direct deposit.  There have been periods where I haven't written or received paper checks for so long that I have to hunt for where I put my checkbook!</p>

<p>Even though I use a debit card for most store purchases, the bank account behind that debit card is actually a checking account according to the bank.  Again, the system defaults to paper checks and you have the option of going electronic as well.</p>

<p>Before we judge anyone who doesn't use direct deposit or who prefers to be paid in cold hard cash, consider that <strong>direct deposit is a luxury of stability</strong>. Steady job, home, etc.  Direct deposit doesn't make sense for a contractor or day laborer who expect to work for a different person each day or week.</p>

<p>I don't think this is all that unique to the US.  There are people in every city and country who don't have long-term employment with a single employer and therefore prefer cash or paper check over electronic payments.  </p>

<p>I'd be willing to bet that this applies to the majority of people on the planet, actually.</p>

","<p>You have interpreted the instructions correctly.</p>

<p>The issue with two jobs at the same time, is that that second job will be taxed at the highest rate; but the second employer has no idea what the other position is paying you. </p>

<p>If you make enough to be in the 15% tax bracket for your main job that means: some of the money from each paycheck is  taxed zero; some is taxed at 10% and the last dollars are taxed at 15%. But the second job should withhold for taxes to cover all the income at 15%.</p>

<p>To avoid problems you should look at the tax form you are filling out this year. Look at the total tax you paid. Not the refund or the amount you owed when you filed but your total tax paid. The government allows a safe harbor if you make sure that in 2016 you have the same amount withheld this calendar year. If that isn't enough, you will owe money in April 2017, but you will not have to pay a penalty.</p>

<p>After you have a couple of paycheck from your main employer, check to see that if you work the rest of the year at that same rate that the federal withholding will make the safe harbor.

They estimate it using the W4 form you turn in that utilizes pretty much the same formula on the website you listed. The reason that mortgage interest deductions (or any others) aren't listed is that not everyone can take the deduction and many people won't itemize deductions (making it a moot point). The W4 isn't intended to be a 100% accurate picture of what you will owe, it is just a blunt estimating tool.</p>

There are also some marginal difference between banks about how records are kept and when the amount is deducted from your account.  The records keeping probably works to your advantage if they ever claim you missed a payment (you have record it was sent, even if they never cash it).  The variation in deduction from your account (i.e. when it is sent vs when it is cashed) could play out different ways and isn't anything that big to worry about.</p>

"How many days do I have to hold a stock before it is considered a capital gain by the CRA?","6921","","<p>I want to sell a Canadian stock from my investment account that I bought a month ago. The stock makes about 20% gain and I am afraid it might go down in the further. If I sell it now, will Canada Revenue Agency consider that 20% gain as capital gain and only tax on half of it.</p>
","<p><strong>You don't have to wait.</strong>  If you sell your shares now, your gain can be considered a <strong>capital gain</strong> for income tax purposes.</p>

<p>Unlike in the United States, Canada does <strong>not</strong> distinguish between <em>short-term</em> vs. <em>long-term</em> gains where you'd pay different rates on each type of gain.  Whether you buy and sell a stock within minutes or buy and sell over years, any gain you make on a stock can <em>generally</em> be considered a capital gain.</p>

<p>I said <em>generally</em> because there is an exception:  If you are deemed by CRA to be trading <em>professionally</em> -- that is, <strong>if you make a living</strong> buying and selling stocks frequently -- then you could be considered doing day trading as a business and have your gains instead taxed as regular income (but you'd also be able to claim additional deductions.)  Anyway, as long as your primary source of income isn't from trading, this isn't likely to be a problem.</p>

"Dependent care FSA and child care provider Social Security Number","6916","","<p>We signed up for a full dependent care FSA ($5000) through my wife's employer at the end of last year knowing we'd need child care this year in some form.</p>

<p>This year we've found a local older woman who watches our child part time in our home about 15 hours a week.  She is married and otherwise retired I believe, but does this for some spare money.  (Don't fully know her financial situation though.)  We do not have her Social Security Number, and the general understanding is that she may not be reporting this money either.</p>

<p>I wasn't aware the dependent care FSA submission through an employer required knowing the babysitter's Social Security Number, just an informal invoice/receipt and name/address of babysitter.  </p>

<p>Is it required now for us to get her SSN?  If she has it will she have a large tax notice due if she then fails to report her income? </p>

<p>Is it possible not to include the SSN, but her name/address?  And if that's the case, will they still track her down if she doesn't report the income?</p>

","<pre><code>Is it possible not to include the SSN, but her name/address?
</code></pre>

<p>No. Similar to how the hospitals now get you a social security number for your newborn, so you can leave with a little crying tax deduction, the IRS has cracked down on FSA reimbursements. They expect to be able to <em>follow the money</em> from your tax deduction to a nanny/sitter's income. 
Your last line is the choice you face, and User58220's warning shouldn't be ignored. </p>

<pre><code>If she has it will she have a large tax notice due if she then fails to report her income?

<p>She will need to declare the income. The tax due depends on many factors. Not reporting it can result in penalties and prosecution.</p>

<pre><code>Is it possible not to include the SSN, but her name/address?

<p>The last I dealt with this, the employer required the SSN of the provider. No exceptions.</p>

"Best way to make sure my son has an income after I have died","6893","","<p>I have a son with special needs, he is autistic and has learning difficulties. It is unlikely he will ever have a 'normal' life or be able to financially support himself.</p>

<p>to give some more information as requested. I'm 39 years old, his mother is 34, we are separated and getting divorced. my son is 3 years old and he has an older brother who is 7 years old.</p>

<p>I own a house which is worth about £135,000 with an £88,000 mortgage left to pay. I earn £50,000 a year, i think my income can increase to between £70,000 - £75,000 over the next 10 years.</p>

<p>I'm in the UK</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","<p>Typically a trust is the solution to this.  You set up a trust fund, and either fund it with money now, or (more likely, in your situation given your income) make it the beneficiary of a life insurance policy.</p>

<p>The trust would invest in something with a reasonable return; say assume 3% to be safe.  So you'd need £24,000 per year, so you need at least £800,000 capital; let's say an even  £1 million would be better (that way if there are a few lean years your son still has plenty of wiggle room to draw off of capital).  Obviously more is safer, and means you can use safer investments;  £500k would be enough if you assumed a 5% return, but that requires more aggressive investments and more risk.</p>

<p>Trusts also are probably taxable, depending on various details (I don't know UK law, in particular), so you may need a bit more to take taxes into account.</p>

<p>You'd need to set up a trust (which incurs administrative and legal expenses), designate a trustee (hopefully you already have a will which designates a particular person as guardian for your son if you and your wife both pass away; you can either designate this person trustee, or someone else, depending on how you prefer to do things).  Make sure the trustee(s) you choose are reliable and will have your son's best interests in mind; you can certainly write the trust documents in such a way as to require that of the trustee(s), but it's very hard to enforce such a provision, particularly after you've died.</p>

<p>In the US, we have a concept called an Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust; that is one possibility for you, if the UK has the same concept - this is a trust that specifically exists to be the beneficiary (and, technically, owner) of the life insurance policy.  From a quick google search, it looks as if the UK does have similar concepts, but please consult a specialist to get the complete information, and to set it up.</p>

<hr>

<p>Also, don't forget to take into account your other son.  Until he's finished with school, his needs should be considered as well; either in a separate trust with a separate life insurance policy, or perhaps using funds from your pension or savings.  He's not in a much better position than his brother if you pass away when he's 9, after all.  </p>

<p>You'll also want to make sure that he understands why this trust exists, and why his brother will presumably inherit substantially more than he will, regardless of when that actually happens. Being open about financial decisions is important, especially when on face they appear to be imbalanced. It's the sort of thing that if you discuss it, and the reasons for it, over the course of your son's childhood, he'll be much more understanding when you do eventually die, than if it's a surprise to him.</p>

I realize that you can't just give someone money unless it's under X amount (last I checked I thought it was 14k), but what are the rules around loaning someone money? I read up on it and saw that the IRS can ""charge"" the loan provider on interest even if the loan provider doesn't charge interest, but this is normally mitigated by the 0% interest being considered a gift and as long as it's below X amount your fine. </p>

<p>I was curious if there were any other laws around this? What defines a loan vs a gift in terms of the IRS, is it simply that the loan will be paid back, or is it only considered a loan if a promisary note is made? Are there any limits on how big a loan can be?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes, this sums it up. X is the amount of the gift exemption, the $14K.</p>

<p>However, you must differ between loan with no interest and loan with no paying back. With loan with no interest you're still giving a statutory gift of the IRS mandated minimum interest. However, the principal is expected to be repaid to you and you must show that this expectation is reasonably fulfilled. If you cannot (i.e.: you gave a ""loan"" with no intention of it being paid back), then the IRS will recharacterize the whole amount as the gift, and you'll be on the hook for gift tax for the amounts above the exemption.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What defines a loan vs a gift in terms of the IRS, is it simply that
  the loan will be paid back, or is it only considered a loan if a
  promisary note is made?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I said - you must be able to show that the loan is indeed a loan, even if it is with no interest. I.e.: it is being repaid, it is treated as a loan by all parties, and is not an attempt to evade gift tax. Promissory note is not a must, but will definitely be helpful in showing that. But without the de-facto repayment of the loan, it will be hard to argue that it is not a gift, even if you have a promissory note. That means, you should make a loan in such a way that the borrower will (begin) repaying it reasonably soon, so that you can show payment schedule being followed and money moving back to you.</p>

<p><em>Reasonably</em> soon is not of course defined in a statute, so do consult with a EA/CPA licensed in your state on how to structure the loan so that it will not appear as an attempt to evade the gift tax.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are there any limits on how big a loan can be?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, but keep in mind that even with <a href=""http://apps.irs.gov/app/picklist/list/federalRates.html"" rel=""nofollow"">statutory interest charges</a> (published by the IRS monthly, see the link), with large enough loan you can exceed the gift tax exemption.</p>

"Using Emergency Fund to Sell Upside-down Car","6781","","<p>My husband and I have an upside-down car loan, which means that we owe more on the loan (about $10,000) than the car is worth (only about $7,000). We are paying a pretty substantial amount each month in insurance and car payments (over $300 a month) to keep this car with 8% interest on the loan.</p>

<p>We can afford these expenses however, we don't use the car. My husband now has a work vehicle paid for by his job and the upside-down car sits unused. We feel silly paying so much a month for a car that goes unused.</p>

<p>We have an emergency fund of $5,000, and a lot of available credit on credit cards (currently no credit card debt at all) if an emergency arose.</p>

<p>We are considering dipping to the emergency fund to get rid of this car. We figure it will probably take us around 6 months worst case scenario to pay ourselves back into the emergency fund. </p>

<p>Is it better to dip into the emergency fund to unload this extra debt and expense or bite the bullet and keep the car while trying to save up money outside of our emergency fund to get rid of the vehicle?</p>
","<p>As well as paying 8% interest on your loan (i.e. $800/year), you're also wasting money on the car: depreciation, insurance etc. So it's worth a lot to you to get out of it.</p>

<p>Set against that is the risk of having to borrow the $3000 you'll be taking from your emergency fund at a higher interest rate (say 30%?) for at most 6 months, which would only cost you $300-$400 even if it happens. You'll also be giving up a small amount of interest on the $3000, but at current interest rates that pretty much negligible.</p>

<p>There is a small chance that an emergency would also cause the available credit on your credit cards to disappear, but in the short term that should be pretty unlikely.</p>

<p>So I think the balance is overwhelmingly in favour of getting out of the loan as soon as you can.</p>

<li>Student loan 1: $1200 @ 5%  </li>
<li>Student loan 2: $1100 @ 4.25%  </li>
<li>Car Loan: $4000 @ 6%</li>
</ul>
","<p>Your comment regarding your existing finances is very relevant and helpful. You need to understand that generally in personal finance circles, when a strong earning 22 year-old is looking for a loan it's usually a gross spending problem. 
 Their car costs $1,000 /month and their bar tabs are adding up so the only logical thing to do is get a loan.  Most 22-year-olds don't have a mortgage soaking up their income, or a newborn.  </p>

<p>With all of this in mind I essentially agree with DStanley and, personally, and many people here would probably disagree, I'd stop the 401(K) contribution and use that money to pay the debt.  You're still very young from a retirement standpoint, let the current balance ride and forego the match until the debt is paid.  I think this is more about being debt free at 22 quickly than it's about how much marginal money could be saved via 401(k) or personal loan or this strategy or that strategy.  I think at your age, you'll benefit greatly from simply being debt free.</p>

<p>There are other very good answers on this site and other places regarding the pitfalls of a 401(k) loan.  The most serious of which is that you have an extremely limited time to pay the entire loan upon leaving the company.  Failure to repay in that situation incurs tax liability and penalties.  </p>

<p>From my quick math, assuming your contribution is 8% of $70,000 /year, you're contributing something in the neighborhood of $460/month to your 401(k).  If you stopped contributing you'd probably take home a high $300 number net of taxes.  It'll take around 20 months to pay the loan off using this contribution money without considering your existing payments, in total you're probably looking at closer to 15 months.  You'll give up something in the neighborhood of $3,500 in match funds over the repayment time.  </p>

<p>But again, you're 22, you'll resume your contributions at 24; still WAY ahead of most people from a retirement savings standpoint.  I don't think my first retirement dollar was contributed until I was about 29.  Sure, retirement savings is important, but if you've already started at age 22 you're probably going to end up way ahead of most either way.  When you're 60 you're probably not going to bemoan giving up a few grand of employer match in your 20s.</p>

<p>That's what I would do.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>I actually like stannius's suggestion in the comments below.  <strong><em>IF</em></strong> there's enough vested in your plan that is also available for withdrawal that you could just scoop $6,500 out of your 401(k) net of the 10% penalty and federal and state taxes (which would be on the full amount) to pay the debt, I'd consider that instead of stopping the prospective contributions.  That way you could continue your contributions and receive the match contributions on a prospective basis.  I doubt this is a legitimate option because it's very common for employers to restrict or forbid withdrawal of employee and/or employer contributions made during your employment, but it would be worth looking in to.</p>

","<p>Keeping a receipt does allow you to verify that the expected amount was charged/debited it also can help when you need to return an item. </p>

<p>Regarding double charging, the credit card companies look for that. If the same card is used at the same vendor for the same exact amount in a short period of time the credit card company will flag the transaction. They assume either a mistake was made, or fraud is being attempted. The most likely result is that the transaction is denied. </p>

<p>A dishonest vendor can write down the card number, expiration date and CVV number. Then after you leave make up a new transaction for any amount they want. You of course wouldn't have a paper receipt for this fraudulent transaction. The key is reviewing your transaction history every few days: looking for unexpected amounts, locations, or number of transactions.</p>

"Will a credit card issuer cancel an account if it never incurs interest?","6727","","<p>I have a few credit cards that are currently carrying some larger ""promotional"" balances. These are purchases that I decided to put on a 6, 12, or 18 month 0% APR financing offer vs. taking any points or cash back offers. (Best Buy being my most used card of this type.) These are purchases such as a laptop or TV.</p>

<p>I <strong>always</strong> pay these purchases off in time (usually a month or two early). I have been told that by only making these 0% financing purchases on the card and never incurring interest is not recommended - that I may be putting myself at risk of the credit card issuer canceling my account since they aren't really making a profit off of me. </p>

<p>Is this true? Should I make some smaller purchases with these cards and incur some interest here and there, or is this simply not true?</p>
","<p>While technically true, a card issuer can cancel your card for almost any reason they want, it's highly unlikely they'll cancel it because you pay your bills!</p>

<p>There are many, many people out there that pay their bills in full every month without ever paying a cent in credit card interest. I wouldn't ever purposefully incur any interest on a credit card.</p>

<p>Related anecdote: I used to have a credit card that I only used for gas purchases because they gave 5% off for fuel. The issuer eventually discontinued the program (I assume because people like me took advantage of it.) So while they didn't cancel my card, the bonus eventually went away. I miss that card.</p>

<p>My conclusion: if you can take advantage of promotional rates, by all means, go for it. You don't owe them any favors. Enjoy it as long as it lasts.</p>

"The difference between Islamic Banks and Western Banks","6699","","<p>I have been doing some reading on the differences between Islamic Banks and Western Banks lately and found that the main difference is that Islamic Banks do not charge interest when they lend out money and do not issue interest when they take in deposits.</p>

<p>Instead of interest they choose to have an agreement with the depositor or lender to share in the profits for which the money is used to generate. So if I am a borrower looking to say buy an investment property or start a new business, I would go to the bank and sign up an agreement to borrow the funds and pay back the principal plus X% of my profits after Y years. Similarly if I was a depositor I would take my money to the bank and sign up an agreement that after Z years the bank would pay me back my deposited funds plus W% of the profits the bank generated with my funds.</p>

<p>The thing I found strange was that the risk lies totally with the party lending the money (i.e. the bank as the lender and the customer depositing the funds). In other words if the borrower buying the investment property or starting a new business makes a loss during the agreed period then they can just walk away and all they have lost is their time, whilst the bank absorbs the full loss. Similarly if the bank makes a loss with the depositor’s funds then the depositor will absorb the full loss.</p>

<p>It seems that the Islamic Bank’s philosophy is twofold; to make profits and to be socially responsible, and they view the charging of interest to be socially irresponsible. </p>

<p>The first part of my question is: If Islamic Banks have no problems in making a profit (as without making a profit they would not be able to stay open and operate), why are they against charging interest? After all interest is basically compensation to the lender for the opportunity cost of lending the money.</p>

<p>The second part of my question is: If the lender is bearing all the risk in relation to the borrowed funds, won’t the borrower be enticed to start taking unnecessary risk in order to achieve higher and higher profits? And won’t this end up creating a bubble environment where the whole house of cards can come crashing down, causing the Islamic Banks to absorb all the loses and close down.</p>
","<p>I'm not sure of the theological basis against usury in sharia law. IIRC, sharia forbids excess compensation, and the modern interpretation of this includes interest. </p>

<p>Rules about banking are common in religious faiths. The Catholic church viewed interest as the ""selling of time"", and since time is a force controlled by god, charging interest was a heretical practice.</p>

<p>For private transactions, modern Islamic banking is a relatively new phenomenon that emerged in the postwar period. I don't think this method of banking is a ""house of cards"", it's just different. Some US states, like California, also subject lenders to higher levels of risk. (ie. borrowers can walk)</p>

<p>Being a non US Citizen and on a student Visa, I am unauthorized to work off campus, and so I am restricted to work upto 20 hours a week on a hourly wage and have no fixed monthly income.</p>

<p>I have a SSN through my on campus job and have been working on-campus for 6 months now, depositing my pay cheques monthly to my account at Chase.</p>

<p><strong>I would like to establish credit history - have heard it's useful to gain employment and makes it easy to rent an apartment?</strong></p>

<p>When trying to apply for credit cards, the forms from the banks assume you are working on a monthly salary or a guaranteed number of hours - hence I have not applied for any cards till now as I am likely to be turned down.</p>

<p><strong>Is it safe to assume that this implies I have no history whatsoever?</strong></p>

<p>I have approached a local credit union that suggested that I take out a cash-secured loan.</p>

<p><strong>Is taking out a secured loan the only way for me?</strong></p>

<p>If so, I have a few questions:</p>

<p>The minimum loan they give out is $250</p>

<p>The rep there recommended that a larger loan amount is more favourable to my history.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In that case maybe a $1k would be a good balance?</p></li>
<li><p>Should I take out $1k as a single loan or four $250 loans? Would this decision matter?</p></li>

<li><p>This CU can give me a rate of 4%, but I was wondering if there are other CUs that have better rates for a rank newbie like myself?</p></li>

<p>Am I making a right decision by taking out this cash-secured loan?</p>

<p><strong>Would it make much better sense to wait till I get a job</strong> (then I would have a fixed monthly salary and can apply for a regular CC directly)</p>

<p>This is going to cost me a lot of money and effort and I wanted to be sure that this route is really worth it.</p>
","<blockquote>

<p>Higher credit scores will make it easier with landlords, that's true. As to employment - they do background checks, which means that they usually won't like bad things, but won't care about the good things or no things (they'll know you're a foreigner anyway).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Probably, but you can verify pulling through <a href=""https://www.annualcreditreport.com/cra/index.jsp"">AnnualCreditReport</a>, don't go around giving your personal information everywhere.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is taking out a secured loan the only way for me?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, but it's one of the easiest. Better would be getting a <strong>secured Credit Card</strong>, not loan. For loan you'll have to pay interest, for a credit card (assuming you pay off all your purchases immediately) you will only pay the credit card fees (for secured credit cards they charge ~$20-100 yearly fees, so do shop around, the prices vary a lot!). If you're using it wisely, after a year it will be converted to a regular credit card and the collateral will be returned to you with interest (which is actually very competitive, last I heard it was around 2%, twice as much as the online savings accounts).</p>

<p>As to a secured loan - you'll be paying 4% to CU for your own money. Doesn't make any sense at all for me. For credit cards you'll at least get some value for your money - convenience, additional fraud protection, etc. The end result will be the same.</p>

<p>Usually the credit starts to build up after ~6-12 months (that's why after a year your secured CC will be converted to a regular one).</p>

<p>Make sure to have the <strong>statement</strong> balance in the range of 10-30% of your credit limit, to get the best results.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You can apply, but you'll probably be rejected. As I mentioned in another answer elsewhere, the system in the US is such that you're unable to get credit if you don't already have credit. Which is kindof a magic circle, which you can break with the secured credit card as the least costly solution.</p>

"Is there a rule that a merchant must identify themself when making a charge","6688","","<p>Recently I sent several credit card payments online. The company that charged my card is a multi-billion dollar company, so not just a small start-up. However on the statements the charges appeared as a bunch of random letters and numbers for the description and location. All other merchants that have ever charged this card appear correctly on the bill.</p>

<p>Since I make probably 30-50 transactions on my card each month, I had no idea who these charges were from, so I disputed them with my card issuing bank and reported the card as stolen. After the company received the dispute, they contacted me and are basically blaming me for not having matched up the amount charged with what my bill from them was.</p>

<p>So my question is, is there any sort of regulation (e.g. PCI) or law that says that a merchant must attempt to properly identify themself when charging their clients' credit cards?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>I think some people were a bit confused about this question thinking that the charge shows up with the name of an umbrella corporation, or third party, but it is literally a bunch of random characters. Here's a screenshot of the bill:</p>

","<p>Here's an excerpt from VISA's <a href=""http://usa.visa.com/download/merchants/card-acceptance-guidelines-for-visa-merchants.pdf"">Card Acceptance Guidelines for Visa Merchants (PDF)</a> </p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>Merchant Name</h2>
  
  <p>The merchant name is the single most important factor in cardholder
  recognition of transactions. Therefore, it is critical that the
  merchant name, while reflecting the merchant’s “Doing Business As”
  (DBA) name, also be clearly identifiable to the cardholder. This can
  minimize copy requests resulting from unrecognizable merchant
  descriptors.</p>
  
  <p>Merchant applications typically list the merchant name as the merchant
  DBA. This may differ from the legal name (which can represent the
  corporate owner or parent company), and may differ from the owner’s
  name which, for sole proprietorships, may reflect the business owner.</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Keep in mind that the purpose of the merchant name is to identify the merchant to the cardholder.</li>
  <li>Work with your acquirer to ensure your name is clear and discernible to cardholders when they read their statement.</li>
  <li>To verify that you are using the merchant name that is most recognizable to the cardholder, compare the merchant name that you
  want to use to:  * Signage in the site photo  * Advertisements or
  brochures, and/or  * A telephone directory listing</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that the key statement above is ""<em>Therefore, it <strong>is critical</strong> that the
merchant name [...] be clearly identifiable to the cardholder.</em>"" Since this merchant was not clearly identifiable to the cardholder, they are in breach of a critical point in these guidelines.</p>

<p>This is from VISA, but I would assume that all other major credit cards would have similar guidelines for their merchants. However keep in mind that these are ""guidelines"", and not (necessarily) rules.</p>

"Using fiancée's money to pay off my student debt","6682","","<p>I have a student loan in my name and I just got engaged (Yay!) about 2 months ago. My fiancée has been saving up and is really interested in helping us get out of debt before the wedding. I think we can do it but I would most certainly need her help. </p>

<p>Question:</p>

<p>Are there any tax issues (or any issues for that matter) with her transferring me money to pay off the loans or should I add her on my loans and directly take it out of her account? I don't want to make it seem like I made that money. </p>
","<p>Congratulations on your engagement, and on your desire to begin your marriage debt free.</p>

<p>Your fiancée can give you up to $14,000 per year as a gift without having to pay any gift tax.  Above that, there are lifetime gift/estate tax exclusions that apply.  You, as the recipient of the gift, do not pay any tax on it.  (It is not considered income for you.)</p>

<p>Having said that, I would not advise the two of you to have her pay money on your debt before you are married.  The reason is this: You aren't married until you are married.  If something happens between now and then and the wedding is postponed/called off, you do not want to feel like you are in debt to her, and you do not want her to feel that she lost money because of you.</p>

<p>Obviously, you do not want or expect that to happen.  So, instead, I recommend that your fiancée saves up her income.  I'm assuming that the two of you don't want to go into debt paying for the wedding/honeymoon, so make sure that you have enough cash to pay for that.  After that is covered, she can save money toward your student loans, but keep the money in a savings account.  Once you are married, the money and the debt both belong to both of you.  The day after the two of you get back from the honeymoon, she can write the check to pay off the debt, and you've got a great start to your future.</p>

Usually, one has to enter each stock sale that is made during the year.  So my question is do people who make frequent stock trades have to account for every single trade they make or is there a less time consuming way to complete this?</p>
","<p>There are two ways to handle this. The first is that the better brokers, such as Charles Schwab, will produce summaries of your gains and losses (using historical cost information), as well as your trades, on a monthly and annual basis. These summaries are ""ready made"" for the IRS. More brokers will provide these summaries come 2011.</p>

<p>The second is that if you are a ""frequent trader"" (see IRS rulings for what constitutes one), then they'll allow you to use the net worth method of accounting. That is, you take the account balance at the end of the year, subtract the beginning balance, adjust the value up for withdrawals and down for infusions, and the summary is your gain or loss.</p>

<p>A third way is to do all your trading in say, an IRA, which is taxed on distribution, not on stock sales.</p>

<p>What can I do to get the highest rating in this category of account quantity?</p>

<p>Note: this question is only regarding the category of quantity of open accounts in a credit score rating. Every other category is maximized (except for age of credit, which all I can do for that is wait)</p>
","<p>First, you need to be aware that the credit score <a href=""https://credit.mint.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">reported by Mint</a> is <a href=""http://www.equifax.com/equifax-credit-score/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Equifax Credit Score</a>. Equifax Credit Score, like FICO, Vantagescore, and others, is based on a proprietary formula that is not publicly available.  Every score is calculated with a different formula, and can vary from each other widely.  Lenders almost exclusively only use FICO scores, so the score number you have is likely different than the score lenders will use.</p>

<p>Second, understand that the advice you see from places like Mint and Credit Karma will almost always tell you that you don't have enough credit card accounts.  The reason for this is that they make their money by referring customers to credit card applications.  They have a financial interest in telling you that you need more credit cards.</p>

<p>Finally, realize that credit score is just a number, and is only useful for a limited number of things.  Higher is better to a point, and after that, you <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/q/59243/10997"">get no benefit from increasing your score</a>.  </p>

<p>My advice to you is this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Don't stress out about your credit score, especially a free score reported by Credit Karma or Mint.  If you really have a desire to find out your score, <a href=""http://www.myfico.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">you can pay FICO</a> to get your actual score, but it's not cheap.  You can also sometimes get your FICO score by applying for a loan and asking the lender.  I last saw my FICO scores (there were three, one from each credit bureau) when I applied for a mortgage a couple of years ago, and the mortgage rep gave them to me for free.  But honestly, knowing your score doesn't do much for you, as the best way to increase it is to simply make your payments on time and wait.</p></li>
<li><p>Don't give in to bad conventional advice from places that are funded by the financial services industry.  The thing that makes your credit score go up is a long history of paying your bills on time.  Despite what you commonly read about credit scores, I'm not convinced that you can radically boost your scores by having lots of open credit card accounts.  At the time I applied for my last mortgage, I only had 2 open credit cards (still true), and the oldest open account was about 1.5 years old.  The average of my 3 scores was just over 800.  But I've been paying my bills on time for at least 20 years now.

In the US many colleges and professional sports teams will market a credit card with the team or universities colors and logo. The bank handles the details and the team/university gets a flat fee or a portion of the fees. Many even have annual fees. They market to people who want to show their favorite team colors on their credit card, and are willing to pay extra.</p>

<p>Some of these branded cards do come with extra perks: Free shipping, discounts on tickets, being able to buy tickets earlier. </p>

<p>There are 4 other types of cards that have limited usage:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gift cards: They can either be general and have a logo like a credit card. Some are rechargeable. They aren't linked to a bank account. Others can only be used at one store. You can't turn the value into cash. Some have monthly fees.</li>
<li>Local debit cards. Used on college campuses and in the nearest town. the limited usage area makes parents feel better.</li>
<li>Store credit cards. Can only be used at that store. A third party bank handles the details. They are generally used to tap into store rewards, or to lock in loyalty. </li>
<li>Payroll cards. Used by some companies to pay employees. Some do it only for those without bank accounts. Other for all employees. They can be a pain for some employees to use.</li>
</ul>

<p>What makes it confusing is that large business can actually turn a portion of the corporation into a bank. Walmart has been doing this, and so have casinos. </p>

"Is a car loan bad debt?","6583","","<p>I've heard people saying that a car loan is considered a bad debt, while a house mortgage is a good debt and so on.</p>

<p>My bank is offering 1.49% interest for a 36 month loan or 2.49% for a 37-60 month loan.</p>

<p>I need help with calculation here because if I calculate this correctly I don't see any 'bad debt' here.</p>

<p>If I buy a car for $15k, I end up paying only $223.50 more within 36 month. Or $373.50 more in 5 years.</p>

<p>This doesn't seem to be a bad loan. To pay $373 more in 5 years is definitely worth keeping savings and instead finance a car. </p>

<p>Note: So I realized that the amount $223.50 is annual rate. So in 3 year it will be $670. Or $1865 in 5 years. Still pretty good for relatively new car. I normally spend $3k servicing an older car bought by cash.</p>
","<p>Here is another way to look at it. Does this debt enable you to buy more car than you can really afford, or more car than you need? If so, it's bad debt.</p>

<p>Let's say you don't have the price of a new car, but you can buy a used car with the cash you have. You will have to repair the car occasionally, but this is generally a lot less than the payments on a new car. The value of your time may make sitting around waiting while your car is repaired very expensive (if, like me, you can earn money in fine grained amounts anywhere between 0 and 80 hours a week, and you don't get paid when you're at the mechanic's) in which case it's possible to argue that buying the new car saves you money overall. Debt incurred to save money overall can be good: compare your interest payments to the money you save. If you're ahead, great - and the fun or joy or showoff potential of your new car is simply gravy.</p>

<p>Now let's say you can afford a $10,000 car cash - there are new cars out there at this price - but you want a $30,000 car and you can afford the payments on it. If there was no such thing as borrowing you wouldn't be able to get the larger/flashier car, and some people suggest that this is bad debt because it is helping you to waste your money. You may be getting some benefit (such as being able to get to a job that's not served by public transit, or being able to buy a cheaper house that is further from your job, or saving time every day) from the first $10,000 of expense, but the remaining $20,000 is purely for fun or for showing off and shouldn't be spent.  Certainly not by getting into debt. Well, that's a philosophical position, and it's one that may well lead to a secure retirement. Think about that and you may decide not to borrow and to buy the cheaper car.</p>

<p>Finally, let's say the cash you have on hand is enough to pay for the car you want, and you're just trying to decide whether you should take their cheap loan or not. Generally, if you don't take the cheap loan you can push the price down. So before you decide that you can earn more interest elsewhere than you're paying here, make sure you're not paying $500 more for the car than you need to. Since your loan is from a bank rather than the car dealership, this may not apply. In addition to the money your cash could earn, consider also liquidity. If you need to repair something on your house, or deal with other emergency expenditures, and your money is all locked up in your car, you may have to borrow at a much higher rate (as much as 20% if you go to credit cards and can't get it paid off the same month) which will wipe out all this careful math about how you should just buy the car and not pay that 1.5% interest.</p>

<p>More important than whether you borrow or not is not buying too much car. If the loan is letting you talk yourself into the more expensive car, I'd say it's a bad thing. Otherwise, it probably isn't.</p>

"Is there a general guideline for what percentage of a portfolio should be in gold?","6579","","<p>I have some gold (GLD), but not much - a little over 1% of my net worth, and about 2% of my non-retirement investments.  I'd like to increase this position as an inflation hedge and to have something that is less correlated with the market as a whole, but I'm not sure how much I should have.  My initial gut feel was to get up to somewhere between 5 and 10% of my net worth, but that's not really based on anything.  Is there any general rule?  Or at least what do you personally recommend?</p>
","<p>I think most financial planners or advisors would allocate zero to a gold-only fund. That's probably the mainstream view. Metals investments have a lot of issues, more elaboration here: <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/7938/what-would-be-the-signs-of-a-bubble-in-silver/7940#7940"">What would be the signs of a bubble in silver?</a></p>

<p>Also consider that metals (and commodities, despite a recent drop) are on a big run-up and lots of random people are saying they're the thing to get in on. Usually this is a sign that you might want to wait a bit or at least buy gradually. </p>

<p>The more mainstream way to go might be a commodities fund or all-asset fund. Some funds you could look at (just examples, not recommendations) might include several PIMCO funds including their commodity real return and all-asset; Hussman Strategic Total Return; diversified commodities index ETFs; stuff like that has a lot of the theoretical benefits of gold but isn't as dependent on gold specifically. Another idea for you might be international bonds (or stocks), if you feel US currency in particular is at risk. Oh, and REITs often come up as an inflation-resistant asset class.</p>

<p>I personally use diversified funds rather than gold specifically, fwiw, mostly for the same reason I'd buy a fund instead of individual stocks.</p>

<p>10%-ish is probably about right to put into this kind of stuff, depending on your overall portfolio and goals. Pure commodities should probably be less than funds with some bonds, stocks, or REITs, because in principle commodities only track inflation over time, they don't make money. The only way you make money on them is rebalancing out of them some when there's a run up and back in when they're down. So a portfolio with mostly commodities would suck long term.</p>

<p>Some people feel gold's virtue is tangibility rather than being a piece of paper, in an apocalypse-ish scenario, but if making that argument I think you need physical gold in your basement, not an ETF.  Plus I'd argue for guns, ammo, and food over gold in that scenario. :-) </p>

","<blockquote>

<p>No, and no. The bank doesn't report to the IRS. In the US - the bank will probably report to FinCEN. It has nothing to do with your tax return.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the US, what documents do we need to prepare in case our large sum
  withdraw from the bank triggers a flag in relevant government (local
  and/or federal) divisions and they decide to investigate?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Depending on what the investigators request. FinCEN would investigate money laundering, the IRS would investigate tax evasion, the FBI would investigate terrorism sponsorship, etc. Depending on who's investigating and what the suspicions are - different documents may be required. But the bottom line is that you should be able to explain the source of the funds and the destination. For example ""I found $1M in cash and sent it to some drug lord because he's such a good friend of mine"" will probably not fly.</p>

<p>The government cares about taxes, and illegal activities. Stashing money under a mattress is not illegal, but earning cash and not paying income tax on it usually is. In many cases money stashed under the mattress was obtained illegally and/or income taxes were not paid.</p>

<p>Yes, reportable transactions will be reported. Also spreading around in multiple accounts/transactions to avoid reporting is called ""structuring"" and is on its own a crime.</p>

<p>This is for cash/cash equivalent transactions only, of course.</p>

"What is the best asset allocation for a retirement portfolio, and why?","6544","","<p>Based on financial conversations I've had with trusted family members, I believe that asset allocation is one of the more critical things to ""get right"" during retirement savings. </p>

<p>Based on an aggressive investing portfolio and timeline, where can I find more information about what asset allocation is right for me? </p>

<p>One example article comes from the New York Times, <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/17/business/17swensen.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=swensen%20investment&amp;st=cse"">linked here</a>. </p>

<p>Of interest would be:</p>

<ol>
<li>articles to read </li>
<li>books to read</li>
<li>general investing paradigms.</li>
</ol>

<p>Specifically, most asset allocation engines (e.g. Vanguard) will recommend a mostly stock-based (not bond based) asset allocation plan with an aggressive time horizon. I'm looking for indexes to invest in, and classifications (small cap, large cap, mid cap, international developed or international developing) stocks. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
What I'm really looking for here is the following: </p>

<ol>
<li><em>Why</em> should I invest 20% in domestic large cap and 10% in developing markets instead of 10% in domestic large cap and 20% in developing markets? Should I invest in REITs? Why or why not? </li>
<li>What mutual funds or index funds should I investigate to implement these strategies?  </li>
<li>Any resources that help to answer questions like this above. </li>
</ol>
","<p>You're right, the asset allocation is one fundamental thing you want to get right in your portfolio.  I agree 110%.  If you <strong>really</strong> want to understand asset allocation, I suggest any and all of the following three books, all by the same author, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Bernstein"">William J. Bernstein</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0071362363""><strong>The Intelligent Asset Allocator</strong></a>,</li>
<li><a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0071747052""><strong>The Four Pillars of Investing</strong></a>,</li>
<li><a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0470505141""><strong>The Investor's Manifesto</strong></a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>They are excellent &ndash; and yes I've read each.  From a theory perspective, and being about asset allocation specifically, the <em>Intelligent Asset Allocator</em> is a good choice.  Whereas, the next two books are more <em>accessible</em> and more <em>complete</em>, covering topics including investor psychology, history, financial products you can use to implement a strategy, etc.  Got the time? Read them all.</p>

<p>I finished reading his latest book, <em>The Investor's Manifesto</em>, two weeks ago.  Here are some choice quotes from Chapter 3, ""The Nature of the Portfolio"", that address some of the points you've asked about.  All emphasis below is mine.</p>

<p>Page 74:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The good news is [the asset allocation
  process] is not really that hard:  The
  investor only makes two important
  decisions:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li><strong>The overall allocations to stocks and bonds.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>The allocation among stock asset classes.</strong> </li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Page 76:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rather, younger investors should own a
  higher portion of stocks because they
  have the ability to apply their
  regular savings to the markets at
  depressed prices.  More precisely,
  <strong>young investors possess more ""human capital"" than financial capital</strong>;
  that is, their total future earnings
  dwarf their savings and investments. 
  From a financial perspective, <strong>human
  capital looks like a bond whose
  coupons escalate with inflation.</strong> 
  &nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Page 78:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The most important asset allocation
  decision is the overall stock/bind
  mix; start with age = bond allocation
  rule of thumb.</strong>  <em>[i.e. because the younger you are, you already have bond-like income from anticipated employment earnings; the older you get, the less bond-like income you have in your future, so buy more bonds in your portfolio.]</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He also mentions adjusting that with respect to one's <em>risk tolerance</em>.  If you can't take the ups-and-downs of the market, adjust the stock portion <em>down</em> (up to 20% less); if you can stomach the risk without a problem, adjust the stock portion <em>up</em> (up to 20% more).</p>

<p>Page 86:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>[in reference to a specific example where two assets that zig and zag are
  purchased in a 50/50 split and adjusted back to targets]</em> &nbsp;
  <strong>This process, called ""rebalancing,""
  provides the investor with an
  automatic buy-low/sell-high bias that over the long run usually &ndash;
  but not always &ndash; improves returns.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Page 87:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The essence of portfolio construction
  is the <strong>combination of asset classes
  that move in different directions at
  least some of the time.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, this gem on pages 88 and 89:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Is there a way of scientifically picking the very best future
  allocation, which offers the maximum
  return for the minimum risk?  No, but
  people still try.</strong> &nbsp; <em>[...
  continues with description of
  Markowitz's ""mean-variance analysis""
  technique...]</em> &nbsp; <strong>It took
  investment professionals quite a while
  to realize that limitation of
  mean-variance analysis, and other
  ""black box"" techniques for allocating
  assets.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I could go on quoting relevant pieces ... he even goes into much detail on constructing an asset allocation suitable for a large portfolio containing a variety of different stock asset classes, but I suggest you read the book :-)</p>

"When is employer 401(k) match not worth it?","6523","","<p>I have always read to take full advantage of your employer 401(k) match.  But what if the match is lower than most?  My employer will match 10% of my contributions, up to the legal contribution limit. I understand that an immediate 10% return on my investment is certainly better than nothing, but what considerations should I make when weighing this against other options?  Limited investment options with the employer plan, higher fees, and risk of leaving before the match vests come to mind as things that may outweigh the benefits of the match.</p>

<p>When is a match not worth the investment?</p>
","<p>To compare apples-to-apples, let's pretend that you are considering saving $5,500 each year ($458 per month), which is the current IRA contribution limit.  And we'll compare your 401(k) to a traditional IRA, which is pre-tax just like your 401(k).  Let's assume the rate of growth on your investment is 8%.</p>

<p>In the 401(k), when you contribute $458 per month, your employer kicks in another $46 with your 10% match. After 5 years of investment at a rate of growth of 8%, your account is worth $37,032.</p>

<p>In the traditional IRA, with no match, after 5 years of investment at $458 per month and a rate of growth of 8%, your account is worth $33,652.  </p>

<p>If the rate of growth and expenses are equal between the 401(k) and the IRA, the match makes a big difference.  However, as you noted, 401(k) accounts typically have a limited investment options and higher expenses.</p>

<p>To beat the 401(k) with the IRA in 5 years, you would need to earn about an 11.6% growth rate in the IRA.  This is a difference of 3.6%, which can cover a lot of 401(k) expenses.</p>

<p>The longer you are investing, the easier it is for the IRA to beat the 401(k).  Looking 10 years into the future, the IRA would only need to earn 9.7% (or 1.7% higher) to meet the 401(k), and a 20 year outlook only requires that the IRA earn 8.75% (only 0.75% higher).</p>

<p>It is important to remember that once you leave your job, you can roll your 401(k) funds into an IRA.  So the timeframe you need to look at for this comparison is how long you will be at your current job.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the answer to this problem depends on how long you plan on staying with this employer (which determines how long you will be getting this match) and how bad the 401(k)'s investment options are.</p>

<p>You also mentioned the vesting period.  Obviously, if you are planning on leaving the employer before the vesting period is complete, this entire discussion on the match is moot, as you won't be receiving any of the match.</p>

"Start a business or remain an employee?","6520","","<p>I am a web programmer with a family and all the accompanying expenses.  I am trying to decide whether to:</p>

<ul>

<li>continue with my current occupation making simple stuff and dragging clients to work with me normally.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you were in my position what would you do?</p>
","<p>My general rule of thumb with start-ups is don't quit your day job until you can afford to quit your day job. If you were a single man, or your wife also could provide income for the family, then you would have more flexibility but if you are the single income provider I suggest a more cautious route.</p>

<p>It may be frustrating to deal with the drudgery of work, but if you really want to see that start up I would suggest getting started to work on it with what you can while working at your other job, until you have enough money saved and enough work done that you can fully launch the start-up full time. It will be a lot of work, (so would a start-up) but it is less risky, especially considering your family situation.</p>

<p>If you really hate what you are doing, I would suggest looking for other opportunities in your field of work. Maybe there is something that you have overlooked, and don't hesitate to apply for jobs you are not sure if you are qualified for-- as long as it doesn't involve time away from your current job an application is fairly painless and the worst case is you keep doing what you are still doing.</p>

"Primerica: All it claims to be?","6510","","<p>I've recently been contacted and had a conversation with a <a href=""http://www.primerica.com/public/"" rel=""nofollow"">Primerica</a> representative.  Their claims of having the absolute best life insurance and getting above average returns on investments sounded too good to be true, which of course made me instantly suspect of Primerica.  </p>

<p>Considering I know next to nothing about finances, I don't know how to verify or contradict their claim.  A google search is less than helpful.  While there does appear to be a good deal of disagreement over Primerica, most of the negativity is towards working for them, not buying a product from them.  So my question is simply:</p>

<p><strong>Does Primerica really have the best insurance and receive high returns on investments as they claim?</strong></p>
","<p>Primerica's primary value proposition is that switching from whole or universal life to term life, and investing the difference is a good idea for most people. However, there are a number of other important factors to consider when purchasing life insurance, and I would also be wary of anyone claiming that one product will be the ""best"" for you under all circumstances.</p>

<p><strong>Best Insurance?</strong></p>

<p>Without getting into a much larger discussion on how to pick insurance companies or products, here are a few things that concern me about Primerica:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>They have a ""captive"" sales force, meaning their agents sell only Primerica products. This means that they are not shopping around for the best deal for you. Given how much prices on term life have changed in recent years, I would highly recommend taking the time to get alternate quotes online or from an independent broker who will shop around for you.</p></li>
<li><p>Their staff are primarily part-time employees. I am not saying they are incompetent or don't care, just that you are more likely to be working with someone for whom insurance is not their primary line of work.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have substantial reason to believe that you may someday need whole life, their products may not suit you well. Primerica does not offer whole life as far as I am aware, which also means that you cannot convert your term life policy through them to whole life should you need to do so. For example, if you experience an accident, are disabled, or have a significant change in your health status in the future and do not have access to a group life policy, you may be unable to renew your individual policy.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Above Average Returns?</strong></p>

<p>I am also highly skeptical about this claim. The only possible context in which I could find this valid would be if they mean that your returns on average will be better if you invest in the stock market directly as compared to the returns you would get from the ""cash value"" portion of a life insurance product such as universal life, as those types of products generally have very high fees. Can you clarify if this is the claim that was made, or if they are promising returns above those of the general stock market?</p>

<p>If it is the latter, run! Only a handful of superstar investors (think Warren Buffet, Peter Lynch, and Bill Gross) have ever consistently outperformed the stock market as a whole, and typically only for a limited period of time.</p>

<p>In either case, I would have the same concerns here as stated in reasons #1 and #2 above. Even more so than with insurance, if you need investment advice, I'd recommend working with someone who is fully dedicated to that type of work, such as a fee-only financial planner (<a href=""http://www.napfa.org/"">http://www.napfa.org/</a> is a good place to find one). Once you know how you want to invest, I would again recommend shopping around for a reputable but inexpensive broker and compare their fees with Primerica's.</p>

<p>Kudos on having a healthy level of skepticism and listening to your gut. Also, remember that if you are not interested in their offer, you don't have to prove them wrong - you can simply say ""no thank you.""</p>

<p>Best of luck!</p>

"Why would someone who thought they will work until they die contribute to a pension plan?","6491","","<p>One of the shocking graphs going round at the moment is from <a href=""http://www.cnbc.com/2016/05/31/many-millennials-expect-to-work-until-they-die.html"">many millennials expect to work until they die</a>:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q3cpK.png""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q3cpK.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Now I'm a UK millennial who wants to retire early, however if I did think I were going to work until I die, <strong>why do I have to contribute* to a pension plan at all?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>*According to <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/workplace-pensions/what-you-your-employer-and-the-government-pay"">gov.uk</a> I have to put in, and that contribution rate will rise to 4% of my qualifying earnings:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The law says a minimum percentage of your ‘qualifying earnings’ must be paid into your workplace pension scheme.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The minimum you pay: 0.8% of your ‘qualifying earnings’ rising to 4% by 2018</p>
</blockquote>
","<p>Why? Simply: because it has been mandated as <strong>law</strong>, and so you may have no choice in the matter whether to contribute or not. Quoting from <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/workplace-pensions/about-workplace-pensions"">GOV.UK &ndash; Workplace pensions</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>‘Automatic enrolment’</strong>  </p>
  
  <p>A new law means that every employer must automatically enrol workers
  into a workplace pension scheme if they:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>are aged between 22 and State Pension age</li>
  <li>earn more than £10,000 a year</li>
  <li>work in the UK</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Next: even if you think you will work ""until you die"", you can still access the money saved in the pension scheme when you attain the required minimum age for withdrawals under your scheme. For instance, that may be age 55, but it may also vary by scheme.</p>

<p>Becoming fully retired &mdash; as in <strong>stopping all work</strong> &mdash; is <em>not</em> a requirement to access retirement income from your pension scheme. In the eyes of a pension scheme, <em>retirement</em> is typically when you elect to take your income benefits according to the established rules of the scheme. Quoting from <a href=""https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/working-past-state-pension-age"">nidirect &ndash; Working past State Pension age</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Continuing in work and your workplace pension</strong>  </p>
  
  <p>If you reached the age at which you can start claiming your workplace
  pension scheme, you don't need to stop work in order to claim. You have
  a number of options, including taking some of the pension you've built
  up while continuing to work for the same employer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As to why things are set up this way: While some younger folk may, today, <em>expect</em> to continue working until death, for a variety of reasons that isn't always possible. Two typical such reasons are: disability, and involuntary unemployment (i.e. willing and able but still can't land the next job). Moreover, <strong>plans change</strong>. Young workers with health and vitality may expect they'll always feel invincible, but end up learning otherwise over time, and may come to appreciate the savings that were forced upon them.</p>

<p>The ""forced savings"" aspect of state and state-sponsored pension schemes are meant to provide <strong>some</strong> safety net for those later years when it is a strong possibility that one can't continue to work. The alternative is to be a 100% burden on family and/or society.</p>

"Retirement Funds: Betterment vs Vanguard Life strategy vs Target Retirement","6488","","<p>I'm a 20 something grad student and would like to open a hands off retirement account with beta exposure to the market and would make monthly contributions. I'm fairly illiterate when it comes to investing, and the betterment account seems so user friendly. However, I realize Betterment is the more expensive fund; and higher fees can have reduce my earnings in the long-term. However, I like that betterment re-balances it self and I <strong>really like</strong> that it allows one to easily change the allocation of stocks and bonds. I know I said I wanted a hands off account, but what if the stock market crashes and I want to allocate more to bonds??? Does Vanguard re-balance and allow you to reallocate?</p>

<p>So far, I'm am leaning towards Vanguard? Does Betterment have advantages? Which Vanguard fund is more appropriate for a hands off investment account for retirement?  Both Vanguard accounts (Life strategy vs Target retirement) seem to have very similar fees and returns over the last 5 years. 
Thank you in advance.</p>
","<p>First, congratulations on choosing to invest in low cost passively managed plans. If you choose any one of these options and stick with it, you will already be well ahead of most individual investors.</p>

<p>Almost all plans will allow you to re-balance between asset classes. With some companies, sales agents will encourage you to sell your overweighted assets and buy underweighted assets as this generates brokerage commissions for them, but when you only need to make minor adjustments, you can simply change the allocation of the new money going into your account until you are back to your target weights. Most plans will let you do this for free, and in general, you will only need to do this every few years at most.</p>

<p>I don't see much reason for you to be in the Target funds. The main feature of these plans is that they gradually shift you to a more conservative asset allocation over time, and are designed to prevent people who are close to retirement from being too aggressive and risking a major loss just before retirement. It's very likely that at your age, most plans will have very similar recommendations for your allocation, with equities at 80% or more, and this is unlikely to change for the next few decades.</p>

<p>The main benefits of betterment seems to be simplicity and ease of use, but there is one concern I would have for you with betterment. Precisely because it is so easy to tweak your allocation, I'm concerned that you might hurt your long-term results by reacting to short-term market conditions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I know I said I wanted a hands off account, but what if the stock market crashes and I want to allocate more to bonds???</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the biggest reasons that stock returns are better than bond returns on average is that you are being paid to accept additional risk, and living with significant ups and downs is part of what it means to be in the stock market. If you are tempted to take money out of an asset class when it has been ""losing/feels dangerous"" and put more in when it is ""winning/feels safe"", my concerns is that you will end up buying high and selling low.</p>

<p>I'd recommend taking a look at <a href=""https://www.snideradvisors.com/blog/index.php/2013/03/you-and-your-emotions-friends-or-enemies/"">this</a> article on the emotional cycle of investing. My point is simply that it's very likely that if you are moving money in and out of stocks based on volatility, you're much less likely to get the full market return over the long term, and might be better off putting more weight in asset classes with lower volatility.</p>

<p>Either way, I'd recommend taking one or more risk tolerance assessments online and making sure you're committed to sticking with a long-term plan that doesn't involve more risk than you can really live with.</p>

<p>I tend to lean toward Vanguard Life Strategy simply because Vanguard as a company has been around longer, but betterment does seem very accessible to a new investor.</p>

<p>Best of luck with your decision!</p>

"Should you always max out contributions to your 401k?","6485","","<p>I am a year out of college, and therefore, i don't have any real retirement/investment plans kicked off.</p>

<p>I was having a discussion with my boss, and he was making a few claims I would like to get some input on.</p>

<ol>
<li>There is no better investment than a 401k. The tax deferral will always come out ahead in the end.</li>
<li>Hence, you should always put 15,000(max) into your 401k if you can.</li>
</ol>

<p>My observations is that this seems like hardly enough to kill inflation.
Is he right? Or are there better ways to invest?</p>

<p>BTW, I am already maxing out a roth IRA.</p>

<p>EDIT: my company does 100% matching up to 6%.
I would be crazy not to take advantage of this. Thats a given.
This question is suppose to concentrate on whether one should be going above and beyond this 6% up to the max contributionss</p>
","<p>To be clear, a 401K is a vehicle, you make investments WITHIN it, if you choose poorly such as say putting all your money into company stock when working for the next Enron, you can still get hurt badly.  So it is important to have diversity and an appropriate risk level based on your age, tolerance for risk, etc.</p>

<p>That said, as vehicles go it is outstanding, and the 'always max your 401K' is very very common advice for a large number of investing professionals, CFA's, pundits, etc.  That said there are a few priorities to consider here.</p>

<p>First priority, if there is some level of company matching, grab that, it's hard to beat that kind of 'return' in almost any other case.</p>

<p>Second, since you never want to tap into a 401K (if you can at all avoid it) before you are ready to retire, you should first be sure you have a good 'emergency fund' set aside in the event you lose your job, or some other major catastrophy happens.  Many recommend setting aside at least 6 months of basic living expenses.  </p>

<p>Third, if you have any high interest debt (like credit card debt) pay that stuff down as fast as you can.  You'll save a ton of interest (it's pretty much the same as investing the money you use to pay it down, and getting a return equal to the interest rate you are paying, with zero risk.. can't be beat.  You'll also end up with a lot better cash flow, and the ability to start saving first and spending out of savings, so you earn interest instead of paying it.</p>

<p>Once you have those things out of the way, then it is time to think about fully funding the 
401K.  and keep in mind, since you don't pay taxes on it, the 'felt effect' to you pocket is about 80% or even less, of what goes into the account, so it's not as painful as you might think, and the hit to your take home may be less than you'd expect. </p>

<p>Contributing as much as you can, as early as you can also lets you benefit from the effect of compounding, and has a far larger affect on the balance than money put into the account closer to retirement.  So if you can afford to max it out, I surely would advise you to do so.  </p>

","<p>[This answer has been updated to reflect changes to Yahoo's historical prices.  It is accurate as of 2017/12/15.]</p>

<p>Yahoo adjusts all historical prices to reflect a stock split.  For example, ISRG was trading around $1000 prior to 2017/10/06.  Then on 2017/10/06, it underwent a 3-for-1 stock split.  As you can see, Yahoo's historical prices divided all prices by 3 (both prior to and after 2017/10/06):</p>

<p>For dividends, let's say stock ABC closed at 200 on December 18.  Then on December 19, the stock increases in price by $2 but it pays out a $1 dividend.  In Yahoo's historical prices for XYZ, you will see that it closed at 200 on Dec 18 and 201 on Dec 19.  Yahoo factors in the dividend in the ""Adj Close"" column for all the previous days.  So the Close for Dec 18 would be 200, but the Adj Close would be 199.</p>

<p>For example, on 2017/09/15, SPY paid out a $1.235 dividend.  Yahoo's historical prices say that SPY's closing price on 2017/09/14 was 250.09, but the Adj Close is 248.85, which is $1.24 lower.  The Adj Close for the previous days was reduced by the dividend amount.</p>

Usually there is no ""common"" property.  Therefore, the fence is located on one of the neighbor's property who will be responsible for the fence.  If the other neighbor damaged the fence, however, that neighbor may be held responsible for repairing the fence.</p>

<p>The reason I am asking this is because if I want to use it as normal salary, the bonus will be taxed with the highest tax bracket of my income and adding the FICA &amp; local taxes to that would take away a very big chunk of it (~35-40%).</p>

"Better to rent with or without utilities?","6391","","<p>By the end of the year, I will be renting a small apartment with one other person and we will be splitting the costs. I am a college student so I've only lived either at home or in dorms.</p>

<p>In general, is it usually cheaper to rent an apartment with the utilities included at a set fee, or is it better to pay for the utilities yourself? I know that this will vary from property to property, but I want to know which is generally better.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if I should include this in this question, but I'm also wondering if it's possible to estimate how much certain utilities would cost if we were paying for them separately from rent. That way I could make a more educated comparison between properties with and without utilities included.</p>

<p>Edit: I forgot to mention in the question originally that I will be living in New England. Between this and the fact that I easily get cold, I would expect to be using heat more than average in the winter.</p>
","<p>I am from Australia, so don't know how relevant my answer will be for the US, but I'll try anyway.</p>

<p>If you are having your utilities (electricity, gas and water usage) included as a set fee as part of the rent, I would say that the landlord has taken the average cost for these utilities and added a buffer incase you and your house-mate use more than the average. They would probably then review the costs after a certain period to see if they need to incease them or not.</p>

<p>If you think you are a low user of the utilities (ie use water sparingly, turn off the lights when you leave a room, etc.) then you may be better off paying for the utilities separetly. However, since you are sharing with someone else, and if you don't know whether they are a high user or low user, then you may end up paying for some of their usage as well. These are the things you may wish to consider.</p>

<p>In the end you will have to decide if you want to pay one single bill each week or month, or have all your costs separated so you know you are not over paying for something you may not be using. Some people feel that not knowing and making one single payment is easier and less stressful, while others may be concerned about not knowing and need to know all the amounts to put their minds at ease. You have to decide which type of person you are.</p>

<p>Personally, I would be the type that wanted to know the exact amounts to pay, but as mentioned earlier, this is made harder by the fact that you will be sharing with someone else.</p>

<p>To estimate the amount for each utility you will need to firstly estimate what your usage is for each utility and then multiply this by the rates charged by each utility company (this can be found on one of the utility company's previous bills). Maybe you can ask the Landlord that you wish to pay the utilities separately for the first couple of months and then decide if you wnated them included with the total rent after that. That way you can work out actual costs and decide which outcome is better for you. There is no harm in asking.</p>

"Payroll tax on wheat given as wages","6382","","<p>We have a farm in the US, with an employee paid with wheat rather than money. He is an ordinary employee that receives a W2. My accountant said that we don't have to withhold income tax or pay either employee or employer portions of FICA tax on his income, because it is ""payment in kind"".</p>

<p>Its hard to say why this sounds iffy, but in my experience with taxes, usually something that creates an obvious loophole is not correctly understood. For example, I could just operate the farm as a corporation, make myself an employee, take all profit as ""payment in kind"", and not pay self employment tax. Obvious loophole = I think my accountant is wrong about this.</p>

<p>Is my accountant wrong about ""payment in kind"" not being subject to payroll tax?</p>

<p>If not, is she partially correct in any way, in that, are there any changes to payroll tax requirements relating to ""payment in kind"", which might explain her position?</p>

<p>Would the situation be different if he was also paid in cash, like 50% cash reimbursement and 50% wheat reimbursement?</p>

<p>Please state the experience you have that justifies your answer. Thanks.</p>
","<p>The CPA is mostly correct. Her use of ""in kind"" may be confusing, but it appears that while our gut would call this ""bartering"" and refer to the rules regarding same, there's a different set of rules that apply to farm workers. </p>

"US ISA equivalent for tax exempt investment & savings","6375","","<p>In the UK you can put up to £11,520 per year into an Individual Savings Account (ISA).  This account allows you to invest in stock, unit trusts, index funds etc.  and all income and capital gains are free of tax.</p>

<p>Crucially, there is no requirement for this investment to be used for retirement and there is no penalty for withdrawal.</p>

<p>I view this as quite an efficient short/medium term saving mechanism.  It also puts your money away in a place that makes it slightly harder to get at (have to sell your investments to get the money out etc) so you aren't tempted to use it in the short term.</p>

<p>Is there any equivalent in the US?  IRA is basically the same thing, but of course this has penalties for withdrawal before retirement.</p>
","<p>As far as I know, there is no direct equivalent.</p>

<p>An IRA is subject to many rules.  Not only are there early withdrawal penalties, but the ability to deduct contributions to an IRA phases out with one's income level.  Qualified withdrawals from an IRA won't have penalties, but they will be taxed as income.  Contributions to a Roth IRA can be made post-tax and the resulting gains will be tax free, but they cannot be withdrawn early.</p>

<p>Another tax-deductable investment is a 529 plan.  These can be withdrawn from at any time, but there is a penalty if the money is not used for educational purposes.</p>

<p>A 401K or similar employer-sponsored fund is made with pre-tax dollars unless it is designated as a Roth 401K.  These plans also require money to be withdrawn specifically for retirement, with a 10% penalty for early withdrawal.  Qualifying withdrawals from a regular retirement plan are taxed as income, those from a Roth plan are not (as with an IRA).</p>

<p>Money can be made harder to get at by investing in all of the types of funds you can invest in using an IRA through the same brokers under a different type of account, but the contribution will be made with post-tax, non-deductable dollars and the gains will be taxed.</p>

"Is it a good idea to ask for a credit limit increase on a new credit card?","6373","","<p>I just opened a credit card like a month ago. I have another credit card that I've been using for about a year now. But I was wondering if it is a bad idea that I raise credit on the new credit card that I just got a month ago. </p>

<p>Also, would it be possible if I raise credit line on my old CC together?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>So I went ahead and raised my credit card limit. Don't know what maximum I could've gotten, but after a few days. It did raise my credit card limit. However, I had credit karma, and it emailed me telling me that there was a hard check of some sort. So I'm assuming that raising the credit limit, they performed this hard check before giving me the amount.</p>
","<p>Perhaps the right question you should be asking yourself is <em>why</em> you need the higher limit.</p>

<p>If you pay your credit card off in full every month, and you need a higher limit just to give you the extra flexibility and cash flow, then that seems sensible.</p>

<p>If you want a bigger limit just for the sense of security of being <em>able</em> to draw that much credit, but don't have plans to use it, that also seems like a legitimate rationale, however many credit cards seem to increase your limit automatically over time (presuming you've got good credit, etc.) so it may not be worth worrying about too much.</p>

<p>If you need additional credit limit to help pay for a one-time purchase or are simply wanting to improve your credit rating, you should really explore other debt options such as a line of credit at your bank, or a personal loan.  Particularly these days you can get a <em>much</em> better interest rate than you can with credit cards.</p>

<p>It's ironic but true that to get a higher credit rating you need to incur debt.  At least, in the US.  What I've been told by loan specialists is that showing responsible credit card use is okay but the best kind of debt for maximizing your credit rating is not credit cards but rather fixed loans like a car, house, college, or etc. that will have a specific monthly payment.  Credit agencies apparently like to see evidence that you can use debt responsibly and demonstrate making payments reliably over a period of time.  So, like join a local credit union and tell the teller you want to take out a small loan for purposes of building your credit rating, and buy a new computer, stereo, or whatever.  Then make regular payments on that over a few years.  Not only will this look better than credit card debt, it'll also be at a lower rate.</p>

<p>If you've accumulated a large amount of credit card debt, and are wanting the higher limit in order to accumulate additional debt, that may be a red flag that your finances are out of balance.  It is seductively easy to rack up an enormous debt, but it can be extraordinarily laborious to get it paid off.  Two of my family members fell into this trap (one while in college, the other while between jobs).  At typical credit card interest rates of 15%, 20%, and even 25%, if carrying debt month to month the debt is going to grow very quickly.  If you're in this case I'd say count your blessings for having a low credit limit and get some help getting the debt in control.</p>

<p>Finally, to actually answer your question, yes it's been my experience most credit card companies are <strong>quite</strong> happy to increase your credit rate.  Often you can call their customer service phone number and get it raised instantly.  And I think they'd send you a free noose as well.  ;-)</p>

"What is the logic behind a 50% of X% 401(k) contribution match?","6364","","<p>In the situation where an employer is contributing a match to a 401(k), apparently a common formula is to match 50% of employee contributions up to a percentage of their salary. I have also seen this phrased as ""50 cents for every dollar"".</p>

<p>If the amount is 50% match up to 6% of salary, this equates to ""you put in 6% and we'll put in 3%"".</p>

<p>Why would they choose to do this, instead of simply offering a match up to 3%? </p>

<p>The <em>match</em> is not more or less either way. It instead forces the employee to put in more money, which has no benefit to the employer. I don't see any advantage to the employer to do it this way, there is only disadvantage to the employee.</p>

<p>What is the logic behind offering a ratio match instead of a 1:1 match?</p>
","<p>Many employees don't contribute enough to maximize the match, so the cost to the employer is not the same.  Under the 50% of 6% strategy an employee contributing 5% would get a 2.5% match not a 3% and that saves the company 0.5%.</p>

<p>@TTT provided an excellent <a href=""https://financialengines.com/docs/financial-engines-401k-match-report-050615.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">link</a> in the comments below to a study titled ""<a href=""https://financialengines.com/docs/financial-engines-401k-match-report-050615.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">How much employer 401(k) matching contributions do employees leave on the table?</a>"" performed by Financial Engines, an independent financial advisory service.

<li><p>792,389 Received some match funds, but not the full match available</p></li>

  If you want to play ball offer them $80k.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is it reasonable to offer so much less than the listed price? I initially thought that an offer at $85k was reasonable while my better half suggested $78k. Also, from what I've read it seems that sellers will cover closing costs a lot of the time. Is this normal? Is this something to ask for initially or later on? How would I go about it?</p>
","<p>Well it all kind of depends.  </p>

<p>The Realtor is your pro, and you should communicate further with him.  Is this a neighborhood on the decline?  Is there a good reason to make such a low offer?  Are you totally off base when you think 85K is fair, and if so why?  Is he just working his tail off for you (a great thing)?</p>

<p>One thing that is a key to this negotiation is financing.  What does your financing status look like?  A reasonable cash offer with no contingencies and a quick close might be less than 70K.  A person with strong financing can get a better discount then a person that is questionable.</p>

<p>It could be that the Realtor is testing the waters to find the bottom price.  The home selling season is closed (typically the summer), and the home has been on the market for a bit.  Offering 70K might mean a counter at 82K, so you can work on an offer between 80 and 82.  </p>

<p>To me, it sounds like this guy is working for you.  You should thank him.  It is pretty hard to find a realtor that is willing to negotiate his pay down in order to save you money.  </p>

"Timing of selling shares of mutual funds with respect to tax and investment income distribution","6354","","<p>When planning to buy shares of a mutual fund, if I understand correctly, it is better not to buy at a time right before the fund distributes its investment income to its shareholders, since the new shareholder has to pay tax on the investment income before his share value actually increases.</p>

<p>Similarly, when a shareholder plan to sell his shares of a mutual fund, I was wondering if there is some consideration about the timing of selling with respect to the timing of investment income distribution by the fund? For example, do you suggest to sell the shares right before or after the fund distribute its investment income?</p>

<p>Thanks and regards!</p>
","<p>I will give a somewhat different answer from JoeTaxpayer's answer, though I fully agree with his first sentence.</p>

<p>What is it you want to do? </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Sell a fixed number, say 100, shares 
of a mutual fund regardless of the price?  </p></li>
<li><p>Sell enough shares to 
raise $1000 cash? </p></li>
<li><p>Or sell your entire investment in the mutual
fund because you just want out?  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>In the days leading up to a distribution from a 
mutual fund (which, by the way, is announced
ahead of time together with an estimated amount
of the distribution), the price of shares in the
fund includes the value of the distribution.
Suppose that it is a long-term capital gain
distribution.
Some share holders will have told the fund that 
they will take the distribution as cash, others
that they will reinvest in the fund, and so the
fund will be holding some cash to pay out to
folks taking the distribution as cash.  Suppose
the fund has announced that it will be distributing
a $1 dividend per share, and the current share
price is $11. <strong>Immediately after the distribution,
the share price will be $10.</strong>  If you hold 500 shares
and opted to take cash, you will get a check for $500,
and of course you will continue to hold the same 500
shares which are now worth only $10 each. But no
change in wealth: you had $5500 invested in 500 shares
before the distribution, and you have $5000 invested in
the same 500 shares and $500 cash.
If you opted to reinvest, you will be sold 50 shares
($500 divided by new share price of $10) and now be the
proud owner of 550 shares valued at $10 per share.
So, before the distribution, you had $5500 invested
in 500 shares in the fund; afterwards you have $5500
invested in 550 shares at $10 each, that is, no
change in wealth.  And in either case, you have
$500 taxable long-term capital gain.</p>

<p>So, if you want to sell 100 shares, you will get
$1100 before the distribution, but only $1000 afterwards.
Whether you have a capital gain or loss resulting
from the sale depends on
which shares you choose to sell and at what 
price you bought them.</p>

<p>If you want to raise $1000, you will need to sell
fewer shares before the distribution and more
afterwards (unless you took the distribution as
cash and are counting it towards the
$1000 to be raised).  Again, capital gain or loss from the 
sale depends on
which shares you choose to sell and at what 
price you bought them.</p>

<p>If you want out completely, you will get $5500 either
way, before the distribution or afterwards. If you 
bought all 500 shares for $10 each, then you will
have a long-term capital gain of $500 upon selling 
them for $11 each just before the distribution. You will get a
Form 1099-B from the fund and report this gain 
on Schedule D.  Selling the
550 shares right after the distribution (or taking
the distribution in cash and selling the 500 shares
after the distribution) will give you no capital gain
<strong>from the sale</strong> but you will have a $500 long-term
capital gain from the distribution that will be 
reported on a Form 1099-DIV and will also be
reported on Schedule D on a different line (but be
taxable nonetheless).  On the other hand, if you
had bought the shares for $11 each, then there is
no capital gain if you sell before the distribution,
while if you sell after the distribution (at $10
per share), then you have a capital loss of $500
on the sale which will cancel out the capital
gain from the distribution, that is, no gain
or loss regardless of which choice you make:
sell before the distribution or after.  Have fun
working out what happens in you bought those
shares in dribs and drabs and at different
prices over the years.</p>

<li>Will my with holding be now for the tax from the new state?</li>
</ul>
","<p>Both states will want to tax you. Your tax home is where you maintain
a domicile, are registered to vote, etc. and you will probably want
to keep this as MA since you state that MA is your permanent residence
and you are staying in a rented place in PA. But be careful about voter
registration; that is one of the items that can be used to determine
your state of residence.  OK, so if you and your spouse are MA residents, 
you should file jointly as residents in MA and as nonresidents in PA.<br>
Do the calculations on
the nonresident return first, and then the calculations on the resident 
return.</p>

<p>Typically, on a nonresident tax return, the calculations are effectively the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Report all your income (usually AGI from the Federal return).  Call this
$X. Compute the PA state tax due on $X.  Note that you follow the rules
for nonresidents in doing this, not the calculations used by PA residents.<br>
Call the amount of tax you computed as $Y.</p></li>
<li><p>What part of the total income $X is attributable to PA sources? If this
amount is $Z, then you owe PA $Y times (Z/X).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>On the resident return in MA, you will likely get <em>some</em> credit for
the taxes paid to PA, and this will reduce your MA tax burden.
Usually the maximum credit is limited to the lesser of actual tax
paid to PA and what you would have had to pay MA for the same
income.</p>

<p>As far as withholding is concerned, your employer in PA will withhold
PA taxes as if you are a PA resident, but you can adjust the amount
via the PA equivalent of IRS Form W4 so as to account for any additional 
tax that might be due because
you will be filing as a nonresident.  Else you can pay estimated
taxes via the PA equivalent of IRS Form 1040ES. Similarly, your wife
can adjust <em>her</em> withholding to account for the MA taxes that you
will owe on the joint income, or you can pay estimated taxes to MA too.
Note that it is unlikely that your employer in Pennsylvania will withhold 
Massachusetts taxes (and send them to Massachusetts) for you, e.g.
if it is a ma-and-pa store, but there may be special deals available if 
your employer does business in both states, i.e. is a MA-and-PA store.</p>

If you're planning to contribute to one (and you should, they're amazingly powerful tools for saving for retirement and for reducing your tax burden), you will have to have some revenue in order to have something to pay yourself with.</p>

<p>I don't believe you <em>have</em> to charge him, though, if it makes more tax sense not to (for example, if his business is operating at a loss and cannot benefit from expensing it, but you'd then have to pay taxes on your own income from it).</p>

"Tracking Gold and Silver (or any other commodity investment) in Quicken 2010?","6310","","<p>I am an avid Quicken user, and I have pretty much every account, investment, liability, and asset tracked in it. I recently started purchasing gold and silver as an alternative, ""backup"" investment, and I'm not really sure how to track that in Quicken. Is there an official way to do such a thing? </p>

<p>When I try to add a new investment, the only options are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Standard Brokerage</li>
<li>IRA or Keogh Plan</li>
<li>401(k) or 403(b)</li>
<li>529 Plan</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't think any of these fit the bill for a commodity investment. None of the other account types, such as a normal savings account, really seem to have an adequate way to track the value of the commodity and adjust the balance of the account. I'm not really sure if a commodity investment works as an asset?</p>

<p>Is there an official way to track commodity investments in Quicken? If not, what would the best approach be?</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>Here is more specifically what I would like to do. As I understand it, gold can be viewed as any other ""stock"" or ""index"", wherein you have shares, value, and a cost basis. I would like to create a ""gold investment"" account, wherein I can track the value of my gold ""shares""...i.e. the actual amounts of gold I have in weight by ounces, as well as the cash value cost basis of the account. I've been trying to do this with a ""standard brokerage"" investment, however I have not had much luck yet (which is partly due to the fact that I can't seem to find a decent index that tracks the ""USD value"" of gold in ounces.) I don't need 100% accuracy, however I would like to have some basic, automatic tracking of my gold and silver investments based on an index of some kind.</p>

<p>One of the indexes I have looked at is the <a href=""http://www.kitco.com/kitco-gold-index.html#RT"" rel=""nofollow"">Kitco Gold Index</a> (KGX), which aims to provide a more real-world ""actual value"" index of gold per ounce. This index doesn't seem to be tracked via the KGX ticker on anything that Quicken has access to, though. The normal GLD ticker does not seem to directly reflect the USD value of gold.</p>
","<p>You don't need to use a real stock like GLD.  You can just create a ""stock"" called something like ""1 oz Gold"" and buy and sell them as if they were shares.  It won't auto-update the price like GLD, but that's not a big deal to update manually once a month or so. I prefer to have accurate data that is correct at a particular point in time to having data that is 2-3% off, or that requires entering the ounces as 10x reality.  YMMV.</p>

<p>This is very similar to how you track US Savings Bonds in Quicken (and might be described in the help under that topic.)</p>

"taxes, ordinary income, and adjusted cost basis for RSUs","6296","","<p>My company offers RSUs — restricted stock units — as a benefit. These vest after a certain amount of time, and in 2013, my first chunk vested with a value of about $6400. As I understand it, at that time, when I accepted the distribution, that was reported as income, and Fidelity even sold some fraction to cover withholding, leaving about $4000.</p>

<p>Slightly more than a year later, I sold the entire lot; the stock price had gone up, so the total amount was $5200.</p>

<p>I'm new to all of this, but my understanding was that this would be a long term capital gain of about $1200.</p>

<p>You should be concerned if you cannot explain the source of the money (legally...). If you withdrew cash from your own account and paid your credit card with it, in case of questions asked you can show the account statement with the matching withdrawal, and you're done.</p>

<p>The point in this report is to point at people who move around large amounts of cash. Usually, people pay credit cards with checks or ACH transactions, but if you want cash - it's your right, as long as the cash was obtained legally. But if you're paying your credit cards off with the cash you got as a bribe or by selling cocaine on the streets, then you should be worried.</p>

<p>By the way, breaking into smaller payments may not save you from being reported to the money laundering detection agencies. The report is per transaction, not per payment, so if the credit card statement is $11K and you pay $5K and $6K - the transaction is still $11K.</p>

<p>Also, the bank can file a report even if it is not required (it was clarified in the other answer to the same question you're referring to), if the clerk thinks the transaction is suspicious. This leaves the decision on filing a report solely on the banks ""common sense"" and internal policies which you don't know. So even paying $10 in cash may trigger a report if the bank suspects wrongdoing.</p>

"Multiple loans, multiple payers - how to snowball fairly","6199","","<p>My brother and I both have a large sum of student loan debt. I have more than he does and my interest rates are slightly larger as well. We are both attempting to snowball our debt separately. It occurred to me that we may be able to accelerate paying off our student loan debt if we snowballed together. We could both tackle one loan together and then focus on the next and as a result, both end up with less interest to pay in the long run.</p>

<p>However, I'm stuck on how to implement this idea in a fair way. We both pay different amounts each month. <strong>Is there a way we can take into account our total balances, interest rates, and the amount paid to keep track of what percentage of payments are going towards each other's loans?</strong></p>

<p>As an example let's say I have four loans at $10,000 at 10% APR (A, B, C, and D), and he has four loans at $5,000 at 5% APR (E, F, G, and H). So we have a total of $60,000 due, $40,000 of which is mine.</p>

<ol>
<li>Does anyone have an equation for this or can anyone better explain why this will or will not work?</li>
<li>Do we have to pay proportionally to our debt at all times in order to make this work? If we pay equal amounts, at a certain point he should stop paying because he's done with his portion and I should continue; how will we know when that point is?</li>
<li>This should help cut the amount of interest we pay. Will it actually do that or will it only benefit the person with the higher interest rates?</li>
</ol>
","<p>First off, your commitment to paying down debt and apparent strong relationship with your brother is admirable. However, <strong>I think you are overcomplicating your situation and potentially endangering your relationship</strong> by attempting to combine debts in this way.</p>

<p>You could consider a simple example where you have interest bearing at 5% and your brother has interest bearing debt at 10%. If you both pay down his higher interest debt first, and then both pay down your debt after, then clearly you will have paid less interest combined. But, by waiting to pay off your debt until later, you have accrued more interest yourself. So who has saved money by doing this? Your brother. You will have paid (let's say, without getting into balances) $50 extra interest to save your brother $70 in interest.</p>

<p>So why would you want to give your brother $50? Total interest savings between both of you in this simplified example are $20. So, in theory your brother could pay you $60 after the fact, effectively meaning you end up $10 ahead, and your brother ends up $10 ahead. Here, you end up in a position where you could still say, in theory 'we both came out ahead'. But what if your brother loses his job while you're both paying off your debt, and he can't help any more? Does he accrue some type of calculated interest until he pays you back? What if he's off work for 2 years and still owes you 30k? What if he just never makes his payments to you on time? At what point do you resent your brother for failing to uphold his end of the deal?</p>

<p><strong>Money and friends don't mix. <em>Money and family mixes even worse</em>.</strong></p>

<p>In rare circumstances where you absolutely <em>must</em> mix family and money, get everything in writing. Get it signed, make it legal. Outline all details of the transaction, including interest rates, and examples of how the balances calculate. In 5 years when things go haywire, following the letter of the law is what will keep you from becoming enemies. But with family, often people have an expectation that ""while we agreed I would pay x, he's my brother, so he should take pity on me and allow me to pay only y, if I need to"".</p>

<p>Finally, to your question about how to calculate amounts to pay: it will be very complicated. You will need to track minimum balance payments, interest rates, and even potentially the <em>lost income</em> which one of you gives up to pay down the other's debt. You could do these things in a simplified way close to what I've set out above, but then ultimately one of you <em>will</em> lose out. If you pay down your debts first, how can you calculate the lost living potential for your brother, who might want to buy a house but can't save for a down payment for an extra year? What if he has to move, and without sufficient down payment, he needs to pay extra Mortgage Insurance on his loan from the bank? Will you compensate him for that?</p>

<p>My recommendation, if you haven't caught it yet, is <strong>Do not do this.</strong> Your potential savings are not going to be worth the potential heartache of breaking your relationship with your brother. </p>

<p><strong>Instead, look at joining your minds, not your money</strong>. Set goals for yourselves individually, and hold each other accountable. Make this an open conversation between yourselves, as it can be difficult to talk about finances with other people. Your support will help the other person, and hopefully help keep you on track as well.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>To provide numerical context for potential savings, which you appear to still want</strong>, consider the numbers you've provided [you have 40k debt at 10%, your brother has 20k of debt at 5%]. Let's assume you each can pay up to 20k against the principal of your loans each year. Finally assume for simplicity that you also have enough to pay off interest as it gets charged [so no compounding], and you pay in even instalments each year. Mathematically that means your interest each year is equal to your interest rate * your average annual balance.</p>

<p><em>If you each go alone</em>, then you will accrue 10% on an average balance of [(40k+20k)/2] = 30k per year, which equals 3,000 in interest in year 1, then [(20k+0)/2] = 10k * .10 = 1,000 interest in year 2. Total interest for you = 4,000. Your brother will accrue [(20k+0k)/2] = 10k * .05 = 500 in interest in total. <strong>Total interest for both of you combined would be 4,500.</strong></p>

<p><em>If you pool your debt snowball</em>, then you will clear your debt first. So the interest on your debt would be [(40k+0k)/2] = 20k * .1 = 2,000. Your brother's debt would fully accrue 5% of interest on the full balance in year 1, so interest in year 1 would be 20k * .05 = 1,000. In year 2, your brother's debt would be cleared half way through the year; interest charged would be [(20k+0k)/2] = 10k * .05 * 50% = 250. You would then owe your brother 10k, which you would pay him over the remainder of year 2. His total interest paid to the bank would be 1,000 + 250 = 1,250. <strong>Total interest for both of you combined would be 3,250.</strong> </p>

<p><strong>In a simplified payment example using your numbers, maximum interest savings would be about $1,250 combined</strong>. How you allocate those savings would be pretty subjective; assuming a 50:50 split, this yields $625 in savings to each of you. If you aren't able to each save 20k per year, then savings would be greater for snowballing, because otherwise it will take you even longer to pay off your high interest debt. This is similar to your brother loaning you 20k today that you can use to pay off your debts, after which you pay him back so he can pay off his. Because you will owe him 20k for 2 years, but an average of ~10k at any one time [because he slowly advances it to you today, and you slowly pay him back until the end of year 2], at $650 in benefit passed to your brother, this is roughly equivalent to him loaning you money at 6.5% interest.</p>

"Opportunity to buy Illinois bonds that can never default?","6198","","<p>Today Illinois bonds were downgraded to 1 above junk. <a href=""http://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/illinois-downgraded-near-junk-by-moodys-sandp-over-budget-delay/ar-BBBMN1S?li=BBnbfcN&amp;ocid=mailsignout"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The article</a>.
Citation from article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Despite the lack of a budget, Illinois has continued to cover payments
  due on its bonds, and, like other states, has no ability to resort to
  bankruptcy to escape from its debts. A downgrade to junk, though,
  would add further financial pressure by increasing its borrowing costs
  and preventing many mutual funds from buying Illinois’s securities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If ""Illinois cannot go bankruptcy"", is it safe to buy its bonds and wait until they mature?</p>

<p>After reading your 4 answers, I learned that Illinois can default without going bankrupt. If they do that what do I (and other bond holders) do? My understanding is that without bankrupt, Illinois will owe me the money forever. Can I sue Illinois and ask Illinois to sell building, lands and rise taxes to pay me back?</p>

<p>Has any state in USA ever declared bond default in the past?</p>
","<p>""Can't declare bankruptcy"" isn't the same as ""can't default"".  Bankruptcy is a specific legal process for discharging or restructuring debts.  If Illinois can't declare bankruptcy, that means it will still <em>owe</em> you the money for the bonds no matter what, but it doesn't guarantee that it will actually <em>pay</em> you what it owes.</p>

<p>If Illinois should run out of money to pay what's due on its bonds, then it <em>will</em> default.  Unlike the federal government, Illinois can't print money to make the payments.</p>

"Why do people always talk about stocks that pay high dividends?","6183","","<p>Isn't it true that on the ex-dividend date, the price of the stock goes down <em>roughly</em> the amount of the dividend? That is, what you gain in dividend, you lose in price drop. </p>

<p>(Of course, sometimes it just happens that the price does not drop as much as the dividend is worth, but then again there are times when the price actually drops more, so the average drop is equivalent to the dividend amount.)</p>

<p>Why is everyone making a big deal out of the amount that companies pay in dividends then? Why do some people call themselves ""dividend investors""? It doesn't seem to make much sense.</p>

<p>Edit: Before you answer, please have a look at the most common myths debunked <a href=""http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/the-smarter-mutual-fund-investor/2014/02/04/7-myths-about-dividend-paying-stocks"">http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/the-smarter-mutual-fund-investor/2014/02/04/7-myths-about-dividend-paying-stocks</a></p>
","<p>It has little to do with money or finance.  It's basic neuroscience.  When we get money, our brains release dopamine (read <em>Your Money and Your Brain</em>), and receiving dividends is ""getting money.""  It feels good, so we're more likely to do it again.</p>

<p>What you often see are rationalizations because the above explanation sounds ... irrational, so many people want to make their behavior look more rational.  <em>Ceteris paribus</em> a solid growth stock is as good as a solid company that pays dividends.</p>

<p>In value-investing terms, dividend paying stocks may appear to give you an advantage in that you can keep the dividends in cash and buy when the price of the security is low (""underpriced"").  However, as you realize, you could just sell the growth stock at certain prices and the effect would be the same, <em>assuming you're using a free brokerage like Robin Hood.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can easily sell just a portion of the shares periodically to get a
  ""stream of cash"" like dividends. That presents no problem whatsoever,
  so this cannot be the explanation to why some people think it is
  ""smart"" to be a dividend investor.</p>

<p>Yes, if you're using a brokerage like Robin Hood (there may be others, but I think this is the only one right now), then you are right on.</p>

"Is the delivery price of a forward contract different from the forward price?","6182","","<p>Is there any difference between the delivery price and the forward price of a forward contract? From the definition Investopedia gives of <a href=""http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forwardprice.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">forward price</a> and <a href=""http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deliveryprice.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">delivery price</a>, they appear to be the same. Is there any difference?</p>
","<h1>Short answer</h1>

<p>The second article you linked to (on <a href=""http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deliveryprice.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">delivery price</a>) states it best:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In forward contracts, the forward price and the delivery price are identical when the contract begins, but as time passes, the forward price will fluctuate and the delivery price will remain constant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In short, the forward price only equals the delivery price the moment the contract is created. After that, they can, and almost certainly will, differ. </p>

<h1>Long answer</h1>

<p>My somewhat longer answer to this question addresses each of the three time periods in the life of a forward contract; the following uses three assumptions/pieces of notation. </p>

<ol>
<li>The delivery price is <em>fixed</em>.</li>
<li>The contract matures at time <strong><code>T</code></strong>.</li>
<li><strong><code>t</code></strong> is just a parameter that represents the current time.</li>
</ol>

<p>Those points look exceedingly basic, and they are. I point them out merely for the sake of completeness.</p>

<p>The three key periods are the moment the contract begins (<code>t = 0</code>), the life of the contract (<code>0 &lt; t &lt; T</code>), and the contract at maturity (<code>t = T</code>). In each of these periods, different factors affect the forward price, and the implications for the relationship between the forward price and the delivery price are different in each period.</p>

<h3>Contract begins (<code>t = 0</code>):</h3>

<p>This is the simplest case. Two parties agree on the contract and create it. As the Investopedia article states, <strong>the forward price equals the delivery price.</strong></p>

<h3>Life of the contract (<code>0 &lt; t &lt; T</code>)</h3>

<p>Over the life of the contract, the forward price depends on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_price#Forward_Price_Formula"" rel=""nofollow"">multiple factors</a>, especially the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot_price"" rel=""nofollow"">spot price</a> of the underlying asset. Because constantly-changing factors like supply and demand affect the spot price, the forward price can, in turn, vary considerably over the life of the contract. The same rationale applies for other factors that affect the forward price, like the risk-free interest rate, the cost of carry, etc.</p>

<p>This implies that in this time period, <strong>the delivery price is still fixed at the price specified in the contract, but the forward price is fluctuating as the spot price and other values change.</strong> In other words, they aren't equal.</p>

<h3>Contract matures (<code>t = T</code>)</h3>

<p>At maturity, the forward price converges to the spot price of the underlying asset. Investopedia has a <a href=""http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/futuresconvergespot.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">nice summary of why this convergence occurs</a>, but a quick explanation is that if these two prices <em>didn't</em> converge, an arbitrage opportunity would exist, and traders would quickly act on this and remove any price differential.</p>

<p>Forward contracts are non-standard, however, so it's completely possible that multiple contracts on the same underlying asset, each specifying a different delivery price, are maturing on the same date (presumably with different parties and counterparties involved). Since there can be multiple delivery prices somewhere in the market, but only <em>one</em> spot price of the underlying asset, these won't be equal for all forward contracts maturing on the same date. Therefore, <strong>at maturity, the forward price/spot price (which are now the same) won't necessarily equal the delivery price.</strong></p>

"Why are there income limits for Roth IRAs?","6181","","<p>Why does the IRS establish a Modified AGI limit for contributions to Roth IRA accounts? I can understand having a limit for Traditional IRA accounts because the government doesn't want to lose out on taxes in a high tax bracket, but Roth IRA contributions are after-tax anyway.</p>
","<p>Because Congress said so. Now, if you're asking for the legislators' rationale, it's something along the lines of:</p>

<ol>
<li>We only create tax shelters when we ""need"" to; otherwise we just make our deficit worse for no reason. Absent a particular need, better to just lower the tax rate in general.</li>
<li>It's a national priority that people be able to secure their retirements.</li>
<li>High income earners already have secured retirement, so no further tax shelter of retirement income needed.</li>
<li>Middle income earners need the tax shelter, both for practical help saving, and to encourage them to do so in the first place.</li>
<li>end result... income limit on IRA contributions.</li>
</ol>

<p>Of course, not everyone in Congress agrees with all of the above reasons. I'm sure there are PLENTY of legislators that vehemently disagree with the idea of income limit for contributions.</p>

<p>But like everything else, it's the result of lots of compromises over a host of issues. But that's the general idea that most legislators could rally around, or they wanted something else in the bill, or they wanted to provide political support to their party leader, and didn't object to this enough to fight it, so that's what the majority approved.</p>

"Calculating payroll taxes & take-home pay: Is provincial income tax deducted from gross salary, or after federal taxes salary?","6163","","<p>I am trying to calculate my paycheck for 2014. I used to use an online calculator but the one I used seems to be disabled now. So, I found the tax slabs for 2014 but its been a few years since I calculated my paycheck... last in grade 10, I think.</p>

<p>My rationale is that <code>(gross - tax)/26</code> will give me my bi-weekly paycheck.</p>

<p>If I understand the tax calculation correctly, I have to break my gross salary into slabs according to the <a href=""http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/ndvdls/fq/txrts-eng.html"" rel=""nofollow"">CRA tax slabs</a> and then calculate how much tax I would have to pay for each slab.</p>

<p>My question is: Should I calculate both provincial and federal tax based on my gross, or does either federal or provincial get calculated from my gross and the other one from the remaining salary? Does that make sense?</p>
","<p>The provincial and federal tax rates are both calculated on your gross income, after certain allowed deductions.</p>

<p>But, don't waste your time trying to calculate your take-home pay that way &mdash; it's a lot of work, as you're discovering. Even if you succeed in figuring the federal and provincial income tax rates for your salary, you'll still need to factor in deductions for Employment Insurance (EI) and Canada Pension Plan (CPP), and the rate at which tax is withheld from your pay may ultimately differ from the tax you owe when you file.</p>

<p>Rather, you should know that the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) offers a definitive <strong><a href=""http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/esrvc-srvce/tx/bsnss/pdoc-eng.html"">Payroll Deductions Online Calculator</a></strong>. This is the same tool that a small employer could use to determine exactly how much in payroll taxes to withhold from your paycheck:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Payroll Deductions Online Calculator (PDOC) calculates federal and
  provincial payroll deductions for all provinces (except for Quebec),
  and territories <strong>based on the information you provide.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Using the tool and inputting the correct information, you should be able to figure out, to the penny, what your take-home pay will be for each pay period.</p>

<p>Note 1: While the PDOC will calculate an employee's payroll deductions, some of the amounts reported by the tool will be employer-paid amounts that aren't deducted from your salary, such as the employer's portion of your Canada Pension Plan and EI contributions. This should be evident in the tool, but I wanted to point it out since the tool is geared more towards employers, rather than employees.</p>

<p>Note 2: Your first paycheck of the year and your last paycheck of the year may <em>not</em> necessarily be the same amount, even if your salary remained constant. Both EI and CPP deductions are front-loaded. That is: your take-home pay may go up at the point where you max out each of your EI and CPP contributions for the year.</p>

<p>Also, bear in mind that the tax you pay through payroll deduction isn't exactly the amount of tax you might end up owing to the government. Payroll deductions are a <strong>deposit</strong> against your actual tax liability, which will get figured when you file an income tax return after the year is over. Once your income tax return is filed, you may owe more (if your payroll deductions weren't sufficient, e.g. if you had another income source), or get a refund (if too much had been withheld, e.g. if you had tax credits or deductions to claim.)</p>

<p>Bear in mind that your employer may have other deductions from your pay (e.g. supplemental health insurance, long term disability insurance, life insurance, etc.) so the CRA's tool may not exactly match your take-home pay. Check with your company's HR department to learn what other deductions might be taken from your pay.</p>

"What is ""financial literacy"" and how does one become ""financially literate""?","6161","","<p>How does one become ""Financially Literate""?  Also, on a side question; what does ""Financially Literate"" even mean?</p>
","<p>Wikipedia has a nice definition of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_literacy"">financial literacy</a> (emphasis below is mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[...] refers to <em>an
  individual's ability to make informed

  finance is now a focus of state-run
  programs in countries including
  Australia, Japan, the United States
  and the UK. [...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p><hr/>
As for <strong>how you can become financially literate</strong>, here are some suggestions:<br/><br/></p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Learn about how basic financial products works:</strong> <em>bank accounts</em>, <em>mortgages</em>, <em>credit cards</em>, <em>investment accounts</em>, <em>insurance</em> (home, car, life, disability, medical.)</p>

<p>Free printed &amp; online materials should be available from your existing financial service providers to help you with your existing products.  In particular, <strong>learn about the fees, interest, or other charges you may incur with these products</strong>.  Becoming <em>fee-aware</em> is a step towards financial literacy, since financially literate people <strong>compare costs</strong>.  Seek out additional information on each type of product from unbiased sources (i.e. sources not trying to sell you something.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Get out of debt and stay out of debt.</strong> This may take a while. Focus on your highest-interest loans first. Learn the difference between <em>good debt</em> and <em>bad debt</em>.   <strong>Learn about compound interest.</strong>  Once you understand compound interest, you'll understand why being in debt is bad for your financial well-being.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>If you aren't already saving money for retirement, start now</strong>.  Investigate whether your employer offers an advantageous matched 401(k) plan (or group RRSP/DC plan for Canadians) or a pension plan.  If your employer offers a good plan, <strong>sign up</strong>.  If you get to choose your own investments, keep it simple and favor low-cost balanced index funds until you understand the different types of investments.  Read the material provided by the plan sponsor, try online tools provided, and seek out additional information from unbiased sources.</p>

<p>If your employer doesn't offer an advantageous retirement plan, open an individual retirement account or IRA (or personal RRSP for Canadians.)  If your employer does offer a plan, you can set one of these up to save even more.  You could start with access to a family of low-cost mutual funds (examples: <a href=""https://investor.vanguard.com/home"">Vanguard</a> for Americans, or <a href=""http://www.tdcanadatrust.com/mutualfunds/tdeseriesfunds/index.jsp"">TD eFunds</a> for Canadians) or earn advanced credit by learning about <em>discount brokers</em> and <em>self-directed</em> accounts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Understand how income taxes and other taxes work.</strong>  If you have an accountant prepare your taxes, <em>ask questions</em>.  If you prepare your taxes yourself, <em>understand what you're doing and don't file blind</em>.  Seek help if necessary.  There are many good books on how income tax works.  Software packages that help you self-file often have online help worth reading &ndash; read it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Learn about life insurance, medical insurance, disability insurance, wills, living wills &amp; powers of attorney, and estate planning.</strong>  Death and illness can derail your family's finances.  Learn how these things can help.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Seek out and read key books on personal finance topics.</strong>  e.g. <em><a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0140167153"">Your Money Or Your Life</a></em>, <em><a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1439163367"">Why Smart People Make Big Money Mistakes</a></em>, <em><a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0071747052"">The Four Pillars of Investing</a></em>, <em><a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/039332639X"">The Random Walk Guide to Investing</a></em>, and <a href=""http://canadianfinanceblog.com/recommended-personal-finance-books/"">many more.</a></p></li>

Or perhaps I can specify in my offer that they should reduce their fees to the seller by the commission amount if the offer is accepted, in order to make my offer more attractive?  Are these types of deals ever done, and if so, is there a conventional way to make it happen?</p>

How should I pay myself, given my situation?","6148","","<p>I do a ton of freelance web design and decided to setup a simple LLC so I could have a credit card to make business purchases with. From my limited understanding, I can choose to be taxed as an S-corp or a C-corp. I believe that as an S-corp my earnings before taxes will not include what I pay myself out of the company's income.</p>

<p>If I were to do a C-corp, would I need to submit a W2 for myself and pay myself some amount of money each month? Then the money I paid myself would be a business expense, and lower the actual amount of money the LLC would have to pay taxes on, with the caveat that I then pay personal taxes on the money paid to me via W2.</p>

<p>My wages are currently under $100,000, and I am the only employee of my LLC. Income varies drastically month to month. How do you recommend I structure the method that I use to pay myself? C-corp or S-corp? In the past I've filed as an S-corp I believe, and had my business income lumped into my personal tax return.</p>

<p>Also, I am looking to buy a home in the next couple of years. Does this affect anything?</p>
","<p>You're conflating LLC with Corporation. They're different animals. LLC does not have ""S"" or ""C"" designations, those are just for corporations.</p>

<p>I think what you're thinking about is electing pass through status with the IRS. This is the easiest way to go. The company can pay you at irregular intervals in irregular amounts. The IRS doesn't care about these payments. The company will show profit or loss at the end of the year (those payments to you aren't expenses and don't reduce your profit). You report this on your schedule C and pay tax on that amount. (Your state tax authority will have its own rules about how this works.)</p>

<p>Alternatively you can elect to have the LLC taxed as a corporation. I don't know of a good reason why someone in your situation would do this, but I'm not an accountant so there may be reasons out there.</p>

<p>My recommendation is to <strong>get an accountant</strong> to prepare your taxes. At least once -- if your situation is the same next year you can use the previous year's forms to figure out what you need to fill in. The investment of a couple hundred dollars is worthwhile.</p>

<p>On the question of buying a home in the next couple of years... yes, it does affect things. (Pass through status? Probably doesn't affect much.) If all of your income is coming from self-employment, be prepared for hassles when you are shopping for a mortgage. You can ask around, maybe you have a friendly loan officer at your credit union who knows your history. But in general they will want to see at least two years of self-employment tax returns. You can plan for this in advance: talk to a couple of loan officers <strong>now</strong> to see what the requirements will be. That way you can plan to be ready when the time comes.</p>

<li>My score has generally improved since the beginning of the year.  It was around 570 on all three credit rating agencies at that point.  I subsequently disputed most of the entries on the credit report.  On Equifax and Experian, the score slowly improved to 650 and 675, respectively.  On TransUnion, the score jumped around madly, at one point reaching 720 before settling at 690.  Part of fixing the score included paying off things that my ex has accumulated in the final year of marriage (but didn't pay).</li>
<li>Besides the foreclosure, there is still the credit card debt (down to $15k from $60k at the beginning of the year).  There is also a collection account from 2008 in the amount of $2,500.  In my opinion, it's not mine, but the collection agency won't budge, so for the time being, the entry is on the credit report.  I am pondering just giving in and paying it and be done with it.</li>
<li>I do have a credit card that I use regularly and pay off completely at the end of the month.</li>
</ul>

<p>Not sure what else I can share that is relevant.  </p>

<p>So, given the situation, what can I realistically do to raise my credit score?</p>
","<p><strong>Time</strong>:  you will simply have to wait because as far as the computers are concerned, you are a credit risk and only time will heal those wounds.</p>

<p><strong>Be credit worthy</strong>:  during the waiting time you have to build the credit worthiness.  Standard things are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pay your bills on time, every time.</li>
<li>Live within your means</li>
<li>Fix past mistakes you are responsible for, or work it out with the lender when you are not.</li>
<li>If you still have a credit card, use it carefully and be sure to pay it off every month on time.  (if you don't have a credit card, visit your local credit union to see what product they have that will best fit your situation.)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Monitor</strong>: get your once a year free credit reports.  Don't pay for a monitoring service, but watch the yearly ones.  I would also freeze your credit to put yourself on hold.</p>

<p>I hate to put it so bluntly, but there really isn't a better way.  There are pretty bad reports from people who pay to have their reports fixed, and if what you say is true the rating agencies will certainly mark you down.</p>

<p>The only thing I would suggest is that if you don't need to apply for a mortgage in the near future, feel free to apply for good 0 interest credit cards and pay down balance on your higher interest accounts.</p>

<p>Edit: I just looked at my recent credit report and I see the factors that are not in favor of a high credit score. E.g.</p>

<ul>
<li>too many inquires last 12 months</li>
<li>too many accounts with balance</li>
<li>length of time accounts have been established</li>
<li>too many accounts recently opened</li>
<li>lack of recent installment loan information</li>

<p>No other delinquencies, no mortgage, significant student loans, $30k car loan within 18 months of being paid off (0% interest, ~8k left). </p>

<p>Thank you very much for your input.</p>
","<p>First, before we talk about anything having to do with the credit score, we need the disclaimer that the exact credit score formulas are proprietary secrets that have not been revealed.  Therefore, all we have to go on are broad generalities that FICO has given us.</p>

<p>That having been said, the credit card debt utilization portion of your score generally has at least two components: an overall utilization, and a per-card utilization.</p>

<p>Your overall utilization is taken by adding up all your credit card debt and all your credit limits and dividing.  Using your numbers above, you are sitting at about 95%.  The per-card utilization is the individual utilization of each card.  Your five cards range in utilization from 69% to 100%.</p>

<p>Paying one card over another has no affect on your overall utilization, but obviously will change the per-card utilization of the one you pay first.  So, to your question: Is it better on the credit score to have one low-util card and one high-util card, or to have two medium-util cards?  I haven't read anything that definitively answers this question.</p>

<p>Here is my advice to you: The big problem you have is the debt, not the credit score.  Your credit card debt should be treated like an emergency that needs to be taken care of as quickly as you possibly can.  Instead of trying to optimize your credit score, you should be trying to minimize the number of days until all of your credit cards are completely paid off.  The credit score will take care of itself once you get your financial situation back on track.</p>

<p><a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/q/48073/10997"">There is debate</a> about the order in which one should pay off their debts, but the fact of the matter is that the order is not as significant as the intensity at which you pay them all off.  Dedicate yourself to getting rid of the debts as fast as possible, and it won't matter much which order they get paid off in.</p>

<p>Finally, to answer your question, I recommend that you <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/q/66510/10997"">attack the card debt one at a time</a> instead of trying to pay them off evenly.  Not because it will optimize your credit score, but because it will help you focus your debt-reduction energy as you work on resolving your debt emergency.  Fortunately, the <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/q/56512/10997"">credit utilization portion of the credit score has no history</a>, so once you pay all of these off, the utilization portion of your score will get better immediately, and the path you took to get there will be irrelevant.</p>

<p>After the credit cards are completely paid off, and you have resolved never to spend money that you don't have again, it is time to work on the student loans....</p>

<li><p><strong>Same day clearing</strong>, which means the sender's account is debited and your account is credited on the same day</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Irrevocable.</strong>  Once a FedWire is sent, the originator/sender cannot send a reversing transaction.  This is a huge advantage of using FedWires because it mitigates risk of reversals.</p></li>

<p>ACH Credit (aka Direct Deposit)</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Next day clearing.</strong>  Settlement or clearing typically takes place <em>Next Banking</em> day.</li>
<li><strong>Inexpensive</strong>.  Little or no cost to send and receive.  (Costs, if any, depend on your banking relationship and the fees your financial institution may charge)</li>
<li><p><strong>Allows for Reversals.</strong>  Sender/originator does have the ability to perform reversals or correcting entries.</p></li>

"How to get a down payment for your next home?  Use current home as the down payment on the new one?","6127","","<p>I bought my first home last year; it's my primary (and only) residence. I intend to pay off the mortgage in 5 or 10 years, then sell the house and buy a bigger one. The new one would cost 2 to 3 times as much as my existing home, so I'd have to get a mortgage to buy it.</p>

<p>For a down payment on this second mortgage, I could simply continue living in my current home until I've saved up 20% for the new one. But this could take awhile.</p>

<p>A faster option would be to sell my current home and use the proceeds as the downpayment. But if I sell the home to get the cash, then of course I'd have no place to live until I close on the new home. And that could take months.</p>

<p>I'm wondering... Would a mortgage lender accept my current home in lieu of a cash down payment? The estimated value of the home could be used as a ""pending"" down payment, and when the home is eventually sold, the final sales price would be used as the actual down payment. Does this ever happen? If not, what is typical for this situation?</p>
","<p>This is of course a perfectly normal thing to happen. People trade up to a bigger house every day.</p>

<p>When you've found a bigger house you want to move to and a buyer for your existing one, you arrange 'closing dates' for both i.e. the date on which the sale actually happens. Usually you make them very close, either on the same day or with an overlap of a few weeks. You use the equity (i.e. the difference between the house value and the mortgage) in the old house as the down payment on the new house. You can't of course use the part of the old house that is mortgaged.</p>

<p>If the day you buy the new and sell the old is the same, your banks and lawyers do everything for you on that day. If there is an overlap then you need something called 'bridge financing' to cover the period when you own two houses. Banks are used to doing this, and it's not really that expensive when you take into account all the other costs of moving house. Talk to them for details.</p>

<p>As a side note, it is generally reckoned not to be worth buying a house if you only intended to live there one or two years. The costs involved in the process of buying, selling and moving usually outweigh any gains in house value. You may find yourself with a higher down payment if you rent for a year or two and save up a down payment for your 'bigger' house instead.</p>

<p>Cash is a tool to them that they use only if they get benefit of it being a cash transaction (one of my friends is a re-seller and he gets a 10% discount from suppliers for settling lines using cash).</p>

<p>Everything else they place on a line of credit.</p>

<p>For people who ""dislike"" credit cards and pay using ATM or debit cards might actually have a very poor understanding of leverage. I assure you, the wealthy people have a very good understanding of it!</p>

<p>Frankly, wealthy people pay less for everything, but they deserve it because of the extreme amount of leverage they have built for themselves.</p>

<p>Their APRs are low, their credit limits are insanely high, they have longer billing periods and they get spoiled by credit card vendors all the time.</p>

<p>For example, when you buy your groceries at Walmart, you pay at least a 4% markup because that's the standardized cost of processing credit cards.</p>

<p>Even if you paid in cash!</p>

<p>A wealthy person uses his credit card to pay for the same but earns the same percentage amount in cash back, points and what not.</p>

<p>I am sure littleadv placed the car purchase on his credit card for similar reasons!</p>

<p>The even more wealthy have their groceries shipped to their houses and if they pay cash I won't be surprised if they actually end up paying much less for fresh (organic) vegetables than what equivalent produce at Walmart would get them!</p>

"Ontario gas prices & HST: What will happen to prices at the pump on July 1, 2010?","6115","","<p>When the HST comes into effect on July 1, 2010 will gas prices at the pump be affected immediately?</p>
","<p>I found a page, <a href=""http://www.ontariogasprices.com/Can_Tax_Info.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Canada Gasoline Tax Information - Ontario Gas Prices</a>, listing fuel taxes by province.  Ontario's gas prices already includes 14.7 cents per litre of provincial fuel tax, and comments noted ""Additional taxes include 5% GST.""  For Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, where HST is in effect, comments noted ""Additional taxes include 13% HST.""</p>

<p>That would seem to <em>imply</em> that if Ontario is introducing the HST, then there <strong>will</strong> be an additional 8% added (Ontario's current PST) to the price at the pump.  I wanted <strong>definitive</strong> information, though, so I did a little more digging:</p>

<p>First, I came across <a href=""http://www.rev.gov.on.ca/en/BULLETINS/gt/gas1_2003.html#Tax"" rel=""nofollow"">Gasoline Tax in Ontario</a>, at the Ontario Ministry of Revenue, confirming fuel tax of ""14.7 cents per litre of unleaded gasoline"".  While it confirmed the fuel tax, it didn't mention GST or HST.</p>

<p>Next I found <a href=""http://www.rev.gov.on.ca/en/taxchange/changetaxstatus.html"" rel=""nofollow"">How are consumers affected by the HST?</a>, also from the Ontario MoR.  That page lists goods &amp; services that <em>won't</em> be affected because they are already subject to both GST + PST, and then goes on to list those that <strong><em>will</em></strong> be affected since they aren't currently subject to PST.  One item listed under ""Change in Taxable Status"" is <strong>gasoline</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...
  <em>some goods and services that were not subject to the PST will be subject
  to the provincial portion (eight per cent) of the HST for the first time.</em> ...</p>
  
  <p><strong>Change in Taxable Status</strong></p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Electricity</li>
  <li><strong>Gasoline</strong></li>
  <li>Heating Fuels</li>
  <li>Internet Access Fees</li>
  <li>Personal Services (e.g., Hairstyling)</li>
  <li>Professional Services (e.g., Legal, Accounting and Real Estate Fees
  and Commissions)</li>
  <li>Tobacco</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>So: <strong>I expect all-in fuel prices in Ontario to jump on July 1st, 2010, when HST takes effect.</strong></p>

<p>Finally, here's one more resource I came across:  Petro Canada has a blog called <a href=""http://www.pumptalk.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">PumpTalk</a> with this post: <a href=""http://www.pumptalk.ca/2009/03/hst-fuel-whats-happened-in-other-provinces.html"" rel=""nofollow"">HST &amp; Gasoline.

  for fun.  If nothing were to change,
  simply adding the 8% Ontario PST and

  Ontario would add 6.6 cents in tax to
  a litre of gasoline.  That means a
  pump price of about 92 cents per litre

<blockquote>
  <p>Another ploy is that children's life insurance is cheap. It is inexpensive compared to adult life insurance because, plain and simply, children rarely die. While the numbers that the sales agent puts together may make children's life insurance sound like a great deal, take the time to run what you'd have if you instead invested the exact same amount used on the insurance fees into a Roth IRA and you'll find the true cost of purchasing this type of life insurance. </p>

"Does the sale of personal items need to be declared as income on my income taxes?","6099","","<p>I have been selling some books that I own.

Do I need to declare this as income on my taxes? I live and pay taxes in Canada.</p>
","<p>Books would be considered <em>Personal-Use Property</em> according to Canada's income tax laws.  The most detailed IT I was able to find is <a href=""http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/formspubs/prioryear/it332r/it332r-e.html"" rel=""nofollow"">IT-332R</a>, which says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>GAINS AND LOSSES</p>
  
  <p>3&#46; A gain on the disposition of personal-use property is normally a capital gain within the meaning of paragraph 39(1)(a). Where the property is a principal residence, the gain > is computed under paragraph 40(2)(b) or (c).</p>
  
  <p>4&#46; Under subparagraph 40(2)(g)(iii), a loss on a disposition of personal-use property, other than listed personal property, is deemed to be nil. [...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This part of the bulletin indicates that a gain might be considered a capital gain - not income.  However, you don't get to book a loss as a capital loss.  This is the first hint that your book sale - which is actually an exempt capital loss - shouldn't go on your tax return unless it's one of the ""listed"" items:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>LISTED PERSONAL PROPERTY</p>
  
  <p>7&#46; Listed personal property is defined in paragraph 54(e) to mean personal-use property that is all or any portion of, or any interest in or right to, any</p>
  
  <p>(a) print, etching, drawing, painting, sculpture, or other similar work of art,</p>
  
  <p>(b) jewellery,</p>
  
  <p>(c) rare folio, rare manuscript, or rare book,</p>
  
  <p>(d) stamp, or</p>
  
  <p>(e) coin.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So unless you're selling <em>rare</em> books, the disposition (sale) of them is essentially exempt as income, regardless of whether you sold it at a profit or at a loss.  If it <em>is</em> rare, then you might be able to consider it a capital loss, which doesn't help you much unless you had other capital gains, but you can carry over capital losses to future years.</p>

<p>There's also a newer IT related to hobbies and ""collecting"" items, <a href=""http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/tp/it334r2/it334r2-e.html"" rel=""nofollow"">IT-334R2</a>.  This one says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>11&#46; In order for any activity or pursuit to be regarded as a source of income, <strong>there must be a reasonable expectation of profit.</strong> Where such an expectation does not exist (as is the case with most hobbies), <strong>neither amounts received nor expenses incurred are included in the income computation for tax purposes</strong> and any excess of expenses over receipts is a personal or living expense, the deduction of which is denied by paragraph 18(1)(h). On the other hand, if the hobby or pastime results in receipts of revenue in excess of expenses, that fact is a strong indication that the hobby is a venture with an expectation of profit; if so, the net income may be taxable as income from a business. The current version of IT-504, Visual Artists and Writers, discusses the concept of ""a reasonable expectation of profit"" in greater detail. Where a hobby consists of collecting personal-use property or listed personal property, dispositions should be accounted for as described in the current version of IT-332, Personal-Use Property.</p>

<p>In other words, if it's not the type of thing where you'd make a tax <em>deduction</em> when you bought it in the first place, then you clearly don't need to report it as <em>income</em> when you sell it.</p>

<p>Just to be absolutely clear here: <strong>The fact that you are selling them at a loss is not actually what's important here.</strong> What's important is that, if the books aren't collectibles, then you would have had no <strong>expectation</strong> of profit.  If you did have that expectation then you could have made a tax deduction when you first purchased them.</p>

<p>So <em>in this case</em>, it is probably not necessary for you to report the income; however, for the benefit of other readers, in <em>some</em> cases you <em>might</em> need to report it under ""other income"" or book it as a capital gain/loss, depending on <em>what</em> those personal items are and whether or not you made a net profit.</p>

"Joint bank account - is this normal?","6096","","<p>I've recently opened a joint bank account with my fiancee. And yet, everything seems to be in his name, with me tacked on as an afterthought. Is this the normal way of doing things? If I were to move to a different bank (I'm not sure I like this one), would it be the same end result?</p>

<p>For illustrative purposes, today I went online to check my balance. I logged in with his username, had to answer security questions I'd never seen before about my fiancee's childhood, and was greeted by his name, all because I'm told there's no way to have two separate logins. His name appears either solely or first on every document as well. I registered my phone for text banking and it doesn't appear to let me register his (thankfully he has a smartphone and I don't, so he can download the app instead). It basically feels like it's his account that I have access to, like when I was underaged and my parents could access my account.</p>
","<p>I had a joint account at Chase, and each of us had own on-line login, and could access the account (each of us also had non-joint accounts in Chase, and with the same login we already had we could access the joint accounts, but not the other's non-joint accounts).</p>

<p>It seems like your bank is really backwards on this, change the bank.</p>

<p>By the way, in joint accounts you have the option of requiring both partners to sign on every document, so that every check or order you write will only be valid with <strong>both</strong> of your signatures. I don't know if that's what you need, but some may want that (it is quite uncomfortable, IMHO).</p>

"Is there an advantage to keeping a liquid emergency fund if one also has an untapped line of credit?","6091","","<p>I've seen several financial advice websites and books that recommend keeping some amount of money (usually a function of your monthly expenses) in cash as an emergency fund. See for example questions <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/30686/how-risky-is-it-to-keep-my-emergency-fund-in-stocks"">here</a>, <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/22625/when-determining-the-size-of-ones-emergency-fund-do-you-also-count-hypothetica"">here</a>, and <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/83/as-a-general-rule-how-much-in-liquid-emergency-savings-should-i-have"">here</a></p>

<p>My question centers around the possibility of using an unsecured line of credit for a liquid emergency fund. It seems to me this has essentially the same pros and cons as storing funds in a savings account, with the extra tricks being that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Any cash you would otherwise have kept sitting in a low interest account can now be invested somewhere better.</p></li>
<li><p>Actually using the funds now entails paying a modest interest rate</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It seems to me that if an emergency fund's purpose is to hold you over in the event of an emergency, then the extra interest one pays is a minor concern. Obviously you might wish to keep some of the fund in actual hard currency in case of a real ""ATMs are down"" emergency, but for the remainder, why would one not just rely on the line of credit? </p>
","<p>People treat an emergency fund as some kind of ace-in-the-hole when it comes to financial difficulty, but it is only one of <em>many</em> sources of money that you can utilize.</p>

<p><strong>What is an emergency?</strong></p>

<p>First, you have to define what an emergency is.  Is it a lost job?  Is it an unplanned event (pregnancy, perhaps)?  Is it a medical emergency?  Is it the death of you or your spouse?</p>

<p>Also, what does it mean to be unplanned?  Is being so unhappy with your job that you give a 2-week notice an emergency?  Is one month of planning an emergency?  Two?</p>

<p>Only you can answer these questions for yourself, but they significantly shape your financial strategy.  Planning is highly dependent on your cashflow, and, for some people, it may take them a year to build enough savings to enable them to take 3 months off work.  For others, they may be able to change their spending to build up enough for 3 months in 1 month.</p>

<p>Also, you have to consider the length of the emergency.  Job-loss is rarely permanent, but it's rarely short as well.  <a href=""https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/UEMPMEAN/"">The current average</a> is 30.7 weeks: that's 7 months!</p>

<p><strong>Money in an Emergency</strong></p>

<p>There are six main places that people get money during a financial emergency:</p>

<ol>
<li>Savings accounts (included in this is CDs or other guaranteed financial instruments)</li>
<li>Investment accounts (stocks, bonds, etc.)</li>
<li>Secured debt (Equity loan)</li>
<li>Unsecured debt (credit cards, LoC)</li>
<li>Insurance</li>
<li>Supplemental income (Social security, unemployment, side job)</li>
</ol>

<p>A good emergency strategy takes all six of these into account.  Some emergencies may lean more on one source than the other.  However, some of these are correlated.</p>

<p>For example, in 2008, three things happened:  the stock market crashed, unsecured debt dried up, and people faced financial emergency (lost jobs, cut wages).  If you were dependent on a stock portfolio and/or a line of credit, you'd be up a creek, because the value of your investments suddenly decreased, and you can't really tap your now significantly limited line of credit.</p>

<p>However, if you had a one or more of cash savings, unemployment income, and unemployment insurance, you would probably have been OK.</p>

<p><strong>Budgeting for an emergency</strong></p>

<p>When you say ""financial emergency"", most people think job loss.  However, <a href=""http://www.cnbc.com/id/100840148"">the most common cause of bankruptcy in the US is medical debt</a>.  Depending on your insurance situation, this could be a serious risk, or it may not be.  </p>

<p>People say you should have 3x-6x of your monthly income in savings because it's an easy, back-of-the-envelope way to handle most financial emergency risk, but it's not necessarily the most prudent strategy <em>for you</em>.</p>

<p>To properly budget for an emergency, you need to fully take into account what emergencies you are likely to face, and what sources of financing you would have access to given the likely factors that led to that emergency.</p>

<p>Generally, having a savings account with some amount of liquid cash is an important part of a risk-mitigation strategy.  But it's not a panacea for every kind of emergency.</p>

"Should I use a Roth 401K rather than 529 to save for children's college?","6084","","<p>I have set up a 529 for my child's college fund but the more I look at it the less useful it seems compared to alternatives. The 529 is quite restricted -- What if she doesn't go to college? What if she gets a full scholarship? What tuition benefits will my wife get as a professor?</p>

<p>I will keep the fund if people want to give her gifts, but I think I have a better alternative.</p>

<p>My wife and I fully fund both our Roth IRAs. My employer also offers a 401k plan, and I contribute up to their match, which ends up about $6500 401K contribution annually and $10k to the IRAs (increasing annually). </p>

<p>However, it seems to me like the major value in the Roth 401K offering is that <strong>it can be rolled into a Roth IRA</strong> when I change jobs. Children's education expenses are not qualified distributions from 401K but they <strong>are</strong> from a Roth IRA if you've passed the 5-year threshold (and you take only contribution, not earnings)</p>

<p>I'm planning on saving more into my Roth 401K under the assumption that I'm not going to be at this job in 18 years. As such, I will be able to roll the entire Roth 401K into my Roth IRA.</p>

<p><strong>In this way, I can transfer the funds, without penalty, into my personally directed account which has much fewer restrictions on distributions.</strong></p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> There seems to be some confusion about my strategy here. I hope this clarifies.</p>

<p>We currently max out the contributions in both Roth IRAs, we will continue doing this. This amounted to $10,000 in 2012 and will be $11,000 for 2013 <br>
We currently contribute to the Roth 401K up to my employer's match, we will continue doing this. This amounts to $7500 for 2013.<br> The contribution limit for a 401K in 2013 is $17,500... so we can contribute roughly $10,000 more in 2013.</p>

<p>This, separately from mortgages etc our retirement contributions for 2013 will be $18,500, leaving $10,000 additional capacity in the 401K.</p>

<p>In addition, we want to start contribution to a college fund. Instead of contributing to the 529, we would contribute <strong>more</strong> to the Roth 401k. Eventually we can roll the Roth 401K into the Roth IRA. So let's say I want to save $6000 for my daughter's college this year... <strong>I think it's advantageous for me to invest it into the Roth 401K rather than the 529</strong></p>
","<p>Yes, your plan makes sense for the reasons you cite. The 529 has limited investment choices, along with fees that are often higher than an exact ETF equivalent. A .5% annual expense, even just .4% higher than the ETF, still will cost you an average 4% over the 2 decades of savings.</p>

<p>You currently seems to be saving enough, but once your wife's income starts rising, I might have some concerns. The current dollar limit on the 401(k) may not be as high a percent as you'd like. But, for now, it looks fine. </p>

<p>You should also note that at higher incomes, you might not be permitted to deposit to a Roth IRA, and might have to go the 'back door' route, depositing to a traditional IRA and converting to Roth each year.</p>

<p>Also - you seem focused on Roth. I'd suggest that leaning toward Roth is fine, 100% Roth, not so much. Consider, a retired couple today has $12,200 standard deduction, and a combined $7800 in exemptions, for a very round $20,000 in income that has zero tax in retirement. Even a couple in the 15% bracket benefits by some pretax savings that's withdrawn at zero. In your case, I don't know the rest of your details, just offering something now that you might be missing. $500K pretax funds to generate the $20K/yr withdrawal. Less than that, and you've missed an opportunity. </p>

"RESP withdrawals: What are the eligible/qualified education costs or expenses, other than tuition?","6077","","<p>A few years ago, my wife and I started an RESP to help us save for my daughter's eventual post-secondary education.  We're doing well with it: we take advantage of the maximum government match, and invest the funds in a diversified portfolio of low-cost index-based mutual funds.  (We may eventually use ETFs, when the portfolio is larger to support the trading costs.)  We also rebalance once per year, usually when new money has been added.</p>

<p>This got me to wondering:  If we do very well, we're going to have a lot of money in that account by the time my daughter is old enough for post-secondary education.</p>

<p>My questions is: Other than <em>tuition</em>, what exactly would we be able to use the RESP funds for when my daughter is attending college or university?  Do withdrawals need to be made with respect to specific expenses? If so, what kinds of expenses qualify?</p>
","<p>From what I understand (I never had an RESP but would consider one for a future child), with the right type of withdrawal, you can use the RESP money for anything education related.</p>

<p>Basically, know that the RESP is considered to have three compartments within it: (1) your contributions, (2) contributions from the government through the <a href=""http://www.canlearn.ca/eng/saving/resp/brochure/resp.shtml#ga"" rel=""nofollow"">Canada Education Savings Grant (CESG)</a>, and (3) the return on the investment, or accumulated earnings. The government contributes an extra 20% on top of your contributions annually by way of the CESG, up to a $500 max.</p>

<p><strong>Tuition</strong><br />
As you noted, official tuition fees, reported on a fee slip, is where one large chunk of the RESP will go. This will be pulled out of your original contributions and is known as a <em>Post-Secondary Education (PSE) Withdrawal</em>. Different RESP administrators (bank, discount brokerage, etc) determine what sort of proof of enrolment would be required, but it ought to be similar between them and different educational institutions. This withdrawal is not taxable by either you or the student, since the contributions were made with after-tax dollars.</p>

<p><strong>Educational Assistance Payments (EAPs)</strong><br />
EAPs are for other expenses that the student would incur by being at university. In the first 13 weeks of studies, you can request up to $5000 in EAP withdrawals (full-time studies, $2500 for par-time), after which there is no limit. Each EAP payment is made up of the CESG and accumulated earnings portions of the RESP, whose proportions <a href=""http://www.woodgundy.com/wg/reference-library/topics/milestones-and-purchases/resp/eap-withdrawals.html"" rel=""nofollow"">are determined based on the EAP amount</a>. This is considered taxable income for the student, or beneficiary, in the year the EAP withdrawal is made.</p>

<p>It gets a bit fuzzy here, from my understanding. The student would ostensibly be able to purchase anything that they could rationalize as education-related, and I'm not sure what sort of proof different banks would need. Maybe just the confirmation of enrolment is enough.</p>

<p>This is the part of my post that should directly answer your question which, using this terminology, boils down to <em>what sorts of expenses can I use the EAP withdrawals for?</em> To this, from what I've read out there, I would say that you could probably purchase anything. From the student's point of view, they <em>are</em> enrolled in a qualifying education institution, and if they don't spend the money on education-related purchases, money required for those purchases will have to come from somewhere else anyway. </p>

<p><strong>Other withdrawals</strong><br />
Any other type of withdrawal is like walking through a minefield. You can withdraw the original contributions without paying tax on them, but you would need to pay back the corresponding CESG back to the government. Other types of withdrawals would be taxable and may incur a 20% penalty. I don't have any more details on that.</p>

<p>As I mentioned, this is from what I've read and looked into for future RESP purposes. A new concept that has popped up is RESP vs TFSA. The TFSA provides the same tax shelter (after-tax dollar contributions, no tax on the gains), but also allows for no tax on the withdrawals. To add to that, the TFSA withdrawals are tax-free as well. The main benefit that the RESP offers that the TFSA doesn't is the CESG. My current opinion (and I could be wrong) is that you should contribute $2500 annually to the RESP in order to get the $500 max CESG, and anything else that you'd like to contribute should go in a TFSA. But I digress.</p>

<p>Hopefully my long-winded response makes some sense. Enjoy.</p>

I don't know what I'd do if I was put in the same position as the one asked.  What are the risks?  What are things to consider?  Would you recommend co-signing, and under which circumstances?</p>
","<p>My thoughts on loaning money to friends or family are outlined pretty extensively <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/119/what-are-the-pitfalls-of-loaning-money-to-friends-or-family-is-there-a-right-wa/238#238"">here</a>, but cosigning on a loan is a different matter.  It is almost never a good idea to do this (I say ""almost"" only because I dislike absolutes).  Here are the reasons why:</p>

<ol>
<li>If the borrower doesn't pay the loan, you are on the hook for the loan. </li>
<li>If you can't won't/pay it in such a case as (1), it your credit score will be trashed.</li>
<li>If they default on the loan and the asset they bought doesn't cover the loan balance, your own assets could be in danger (this could mean garnished wages, property liens, lawsuits or other legal trouble)</li>
<li>When you apply for other loans of your own, this loan will apply to your debt/income ratio, and apply to your credit score, possibly negatively effecting your ability to borrow in the future</li>
<li>If they default on the loan, not only will you be mad at them for not holding up their end of the agreement, they may be mad at <em>you</em> for not taking over payments for them.</li>
<li>If they need a co-borrower, it means the bank thinks that they are not a good loan risk, and by their calculations <strong>they won't be able to pay back the loan</strong>.  Usually when someone is unable to pay a loan, it isn't for lack of trying.  Thus, your knowing their good character probably counts for little when the chips are down.  If the bank thinks the math won't work out, it probably won't and you will be the one left to pick up the pieces.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, all that said, if my sister or parents were dying of cancer and cosigning a loan was the only way to cure them, I might consider cosigning on a loan with them, if that was the only option.  But, I would bet that 99.9% of such cases are not so dire, and your would-be co-borrower will survive with out the co-signing.</p>

","<p>Generally, I would say that you should pay it off if you have the money available. Why pay interest if you have the money? That is, of course, if your money can earn you more than the interest you pay (which can happen if you got a very low APR for your car loan, but then you probably have excellent credit already and shouldn't care about the history of the loan on your report).</p>

"what happens if you don't start collecting social security until you're 75?","6048","","<p>My father recently turned 70 and distrusts banks somewhat. He doesn't feel he currently needs the extra income that social security would provide and that if he took the extra money now that that money could disappear in a hypothetical lawsuit.</p>

<p>It's his understanding that if he doesn't collect his retirement income immediately that when he starts collecting it he'll get a one time lump sum back payment for the payments he didn't collect since he was 70. Like if he started collecting when he was 75 his first social security check would include five years worth of payments.</p>

<p>It's also his understanding that if he dies without ever having collected social security the estate can ask for back payment on his unclaimed social security payments.</p>

<p>Is that correct or is my father basically just throwing away free money?</p>
","<p>You'd need to talk with an attorney familiar with Social Security, or an appropriately qualified SSA representative to be sure - but all signs point to the idea that unfortunately Social Security does not work the way your father was told it would. And if he doesn't file to receive benefits the reality is actually much worse than ""throwing away free money""! However, this is not due to a complete misunderstanding of the system! Social Security does work the way he thinks in some instances, just that the rules don't apply to his exact situation!</p>

<p>First of all, retroactive benefits come in a few forms:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href=""http://time.com/money/2886680/how-to-get-social-security-lump-sums-without-the-lumps/"">File and suspend to get a lump only if you really need it</a> - BEFORE the age of 70 only! In this method you apply for retirement, but you tell the SSA to suspend/delay your benefits. You are entitled to full lump sum of the payments you deferred...but at a cost of getting lower monthly benefits permanently (and that also lowers spousal and dependent children's benefits, too - if those could apply to your dad). But note that at the age of 70, <a href=""https://www.ssa.gov/planners/retire/suspend.html"">Social Security will stop deferring the payments and start paying you the full maximum retirement benefit monthly</a>, with no lump sum. This is a kind of emergency insurance policy for those who want to try to defer retirement benefits, but who want the opportunity to cash out and get the money they would have been getting ""just in case"".</p></li>
<li><p>You can get <a href=""https://www.ssa.gov/planners/retire/delayret.html"">up to 6 months of retroactive benefits</a>, such as if you wait past your exact retirement age to apply for benefits. But no more: ""we cannot pay retroactive benefits for any month before you reached full retirement age or more than 6 months in the past"".</p></li>
<li><p>As for after-death benefits, an estate can only get benefits that were already due to be paid, which generally means a person died and did not get their benefits for that month, so SSA can re-issue a check to the estate <a href=""https://www.socialsecurity.gov/forms/ssa-1724.html"">following these rules</a>. But as a person cannot be due a lump sum payment after age 70 (for more than 6 months at most), the estate will only be able to get at most 1-6 months of payments (and 6 months is doubtful - you'll need to ask a lawyer if that much would even be possible). If your father was below 70 and wanted to file-and-suspend, the question of lump on death would be more complex and I don't know that answer - but once you are past 70 this doesn't matter any more as you aren't due a lump anymore.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>What about lawsuits?</h2>

<p>Given the above, we've established pretty clearly that if you don't claim your benefits within 6 months after age 70, any months of payment you would have gotten are just forfeited to the system. But if you claim the benefits and stick them in the bank, can they be taken?</p>

<p>Well, if a lawsuit is really a worry, then yes these accumulated funds can required to pay a debt - but this potential for loss can be protected against without forfeiting the benefits entirely! This is not very common, but if your father doesn't need the money now he may be able to deposit some of the money into a special partially-lawsuit protected format of the Roth IRA (which has no age limits) <a href=""http://www.bankrate.com/finance/retirement/contributing-to-an-ira-during-retirement.aspx"">as detailed here</a>. If he never gets sued, that's OK - it's still his money! If he passes away, the value goes to his estate and does not disappear. And he doesn't forfeit any of his earned retirement benefits.</p>

<h2>It's Not Free Money - It's His Money</h2>

<p>Finally, I would like to share one last thing with you and your father. These benefits aren't free - he has been paying a portion of his paycheck for decades into Social Security, and now he is eligible for the maximum amount of benefits per month that he will qualify for - and if he wants to keep working he loses no benefit and <a href=""http://www.bankrate.com/finance/retirement/apply-for-social-security-past-age-70.aspx"">the amount could potentially even go up</a>. That's up to him.</p>

<p>But not filing for benefits now will mean that all this money he's been paying in for decades will just be lost - they'll basically just be a tax he's paid out to other retirees. His estate (which means you kids) won't get any of it, either. That'd just be a waste for everyone involved.</p>

<p>If you have continued doubts or questions, I wouldn't hesitate to consult a specialist lawyer or talk with the SSA directly to make sure this is all correct. It's his money, and he has earned his benefits for many years. I very much hope he gets to enjoy as much of them as he can!</p>

He did it again and the state apparently refused to withhold income taxes.</p>

<p>Why is this happening? I am not necessarily a fan of paying taxes, but I don't want to pay a giant amount at the end of the year.</p>

<p>What can I do about it?</p>
","<p>In states which have an income tax and require withholding (like Utah), the employer which issues the pay check is responsible for deducting the tax from your pay and sending it to the state.  This is just like the procedure for U.S. federal taxes; the employer deducts the federal tax and sends it to the U.S. Treasury.</p>

<p>If you are employed in Utah, your employer is responsible for doing this.  The amount typically does depend on various factors, including the number of exemptions declared by you on your W-4 form, and can in some cases be zero.  (Even in that case, it is normal to have a deduction listed on your pay stub, just with a zero amount).  You need to check with your company's payroll department or pay accountant.</p>

"How to know when to buy british pound","6028","","<p>I will have to pay a tuition fee of 6000 British Pound by the end of August and I own Euros.
How can I decide if I should convert my currency now or if I should wait a few months. I have absolutely no clue in this area.</p>

<p>I am not asking for a binary answer a la ""do it now"" vs. ""wait until fall"", although that is appreciated. Rather I would like to know on what rationale such a decision should be based. When you were in my position, what information would tell you how the euro/gbp will likely perform?</p>

<p>I am aware that only educated guesses are possible. However I don't even know what I should read to educate myself about this.</p>
","<p>My usual advice is to monitor longer term trends.  For example, I convert Euros to US Dollars or vice versa on a somewhat regular basis.  I know that for the last few years, the typical annual cycle has been to vary between an exchange rate of $1.22 per 1 euro to $1.35+ per 1 euro.  It's taken on average 6 to 8 months to cycle between the highs and lows.  If the exchange rate is on the higher side, I try to wait for it to cycle back down to at least the mid point.</p>

<p>The situation right now is more complicated than usual.  The attitude of the Greek government and the new ECB policy of buying government bonds make it difficult to predict how the value of the Euro will evolve.  The Euro is quite low right now, but it has been fairly stable the last few days in spite of the large uncertainty around Greece.  One strategy could be to wait a month or two to see how the Greek situation plays out while assuming that the Euro won't go much lower than it is today even if things look bad.  If it looks like the crisis will deepen, you might just convert immediately and accept a poor exchange rate to avoid uncertainty.  If it looks like the Greek situation will resolve amicably, you might wait until later in the summer to see if the Euro recovers.</p>

"Ontario HST: How to calculate new homebuyer's HST housing rebate?","6026","","<p>I'm buying a home from a develpoer, and I qualify for the first time homebuyer rebate. I'm wondering how Ontario's HST rebate for first time homebuyers is calculated. </p>

<p>The paragraph below is taken from <a href=""http://www.rev.gov.on.ca/en/notices/hst/02.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rev.gov.on.ca/en/notices/hst/02.html</a> and I thought I'd check with you financial gurus, because its not entirely clear.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The effect of the enhanced rebate
  would be to apply the provincial
  portion of the single sales tax at a
  rate of two per cent on the first
  $400,000 of the purchase price of a
  new home and at a rate of eight per
  cent on the portion above $400,000.
  The rebate would be calculated as 75
  per cent of the provincial portion of
  the single sales tax payable on the
  purchase of a new home, up to a
  maximum rebate of $24,000.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What exactly is the 'provincial portion'? Is it the old PST? (8% of purchase price)?</p>

<p>So does that mean if I'm buying a place for $300,000 before taxes, the rebate would be </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>0.75 x 0.08 x $300,000 (to a max of $24,000) = $18,000 rebate ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>Short answer: Your calculations are right, the rebate is 6% of your purchase price. Which is $18,000</p>

<p>Long answer: HST will not affect new home prices below $400K.  Which is confirmed by the 2nd paragraph under the Enhanced New Housing Rebate heading</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The new housing rebate would be enhanced so that new homes purchased as primary residences across all price ranges would qualify for a rebate of up to $24,000, while continuing to ensure that, on average, <strong>new homes priced up to $400,000 would not be subject to additional tax compared to the retail sales tax (RST) currently embedded in the price of new homes.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So there will be no extra taxes compared to when you purchase it now versus pre-HST in June 31, 2010.  However, at the time of sale, you'll still pay the tax of 300K * 0.13 = 39K but get a rebate when you file your taxes of 300K * 0.06 = 18K </p>

<p>Should I worry about an IRA at this age? Are there smarter investment options at this age?</p>

<ul>
<li>Is there a certain amount I need to invest in an IRA in order to qualify for the deduction?</li>
<li>What kind of IRA should I get?</li>
<li>Would it be more advantageous to open one through my employer?</li>
<li>Is a 401K a better option?</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>One of the reasons I'm considering an IRA is because I'm learning about minimizing my taxes, and am making it a goal to pay as little to the IRS as possible.</p>

<p>I'm leaning toward whatever option will require me to pay the least in taxes.</p>
","<p>There are lots of sub-parts to your question. Let's takle them one at a time.</p>

<p><strong>Should I worry about an IRA at this age?</strong><br>
Absolutely! Or at least some form of retirement account. When you are young is the BEST time to start putting money into a retirement account because you have so much time for it to grow. <a href=""http://www.tuliptreepress.com/lesson1.htm"">Compounding interest is a magical thing</a>. Even if you can only afford to put a very small amount in the account, do it! </p>

<p>You will have to put a heck of a lot less money into the account over your working career if you start now.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a certain amount  you need for the IRA deduction?</strong><br>
No. Essentially with a traditional IRA you can just subtract the amount you deposited (up to the contribution limit) from your income when calculating your taxes. </p>

<p><strong>What kind of IRA should I get?</strong><br>
I suggest a ROTH IRA, but be warned that with that kind you get the tax breaks when you retire, not now. If you think taxes will be higher in 40 years or so, then the Roth is a clear winner. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Traditional IRA:</strong> Tax deduction this year for contribution; investment
  plus gains are taxed as income when
  you take the money out at retirement.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Roth IRA:</strong> Investment amount is taxed in the year you put it in; no
  taxes on investment amount or gains
  when you take it out at retirement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given the long horizon that you will be investing, the money is likely going to at least double. So the total amount you are taxed on over your lifetime would probably be less with the ROTH even if tax rates remain the same.</p>

<p><strong>Is the 401K a better option?</strong><br>
If they offer a match (most do) then it is a no-brainer, the employer 401K always comes out on top because they are basically paying you extra to put money into savings. </p>

<p>If there is no match, I suggest a Roth because company 401K plans usually have hidden fees that are much higher than you are going to pay for setting up your own IRA or Roth IRA with a broker.</p>

","<p>These numbers are way for the company to identify the transaction.</p>

<p><strong>It's never a bad idea</strong> to store them. If you do have to speak with someone again it's often pretty convenient to just give them this number, it allows the company rep to pull up the information fairly quickly.</p>

<p>Most of my confirmation numbers are emailed to me so I just hit archive instead of delete.</p>

<p>I would also like to add if you do lose the number, don't worry it's not the end of the world because most companies have another way of identifying you, it just might take a little longer.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Does it provide you any help to identify the transaction?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It might, for instance if I pay Chase and they email me a confirmation(which they do) I can search my email using ""chase"" or even auto-filter these emails into a label(gmail)/folder(if not gmail). You can in a way do this with the confirmation number, it would be more difficult since you would have to write these down and then search that number.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is a company going to believe your confirmation number if they can't find it using an internal search?</p>

<p>They wont tell you your a lair, but no your confirmation number won't assist them in finding your transaction. They will probably try to find it some other way instead.</p>

Paying on those debts will refresh them and they will harm you longer.  We can debate the ethics of that advice in the comments, but if you want your score to raise, I suggest just waiting about anything over six years old while you tackle the newer ones.</p>

<p>This is a SLOW process.  Your credit score will still take a couple years to heal once you fix your report.  But that is the point of the score after all.  It is a history of how you handle money and debt.</p>

"If Bernie Madoff had invested in Berkshire Hathaway, would the ponzi actually have succeeded?","5986","","<p>Bernie Madoff operated the largest known Ponzi scam in history, defrauding people of an estimated $20B for almost 3 decades. From Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rather than offer high returns to all comers, Madoff offered modest but steady returns to an exclusive clientele. ... to deliver 12% annual returns to the investor, Madoff needed to earn 16% gross, so as to distribute a 4% fee to the feeder fund managers, who would secure new victims, be ""willfully blind, and not get too intrusive"".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If Bernie Madoff had simply invested everything into Berkshire Hathaway, and forged his 12% annual returns as he did, would the ponzi actually have succeeded?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Berkshire Hathaway averaged an annual growth in book value of 19.7% to
  its shareholders for the last 49 years (compared to 9.8% from the S&amp;P
  500 with dividends included for the same period), while employing
  large amounts of capital, and minimal debt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You could say that Berkshire Hathaway was only a good investment in hindsight, but it had a 14-year track record of success at the time when Bernie was starting his ponzi (1980). Doesn't seem like a bad gamble. Of course it's still fraud, but I thought the idea was puzzling. If it makes sense, why didn't Bernie actually invest his clients' money... into anything at all? I understand that he was running a ponzi and trying to defraud people, but he could still do all that while having a reasonable chance of making everybody happy. Or am I missing something?</p>
","<p>I could be wrong, but I doubt that Bernie <em>started out</em> with any intention of defrauding anyone, really.  I suspect it began the first time he hit a quarter when his returns were lower than everyone else's, or at least not as high as he'd promised his investors they'd be, so he fudged the numbers and lied to get past the moment, thinking he'd just make up for it the next quarter.  Only that never happened, and so the lie carried forward and maybe grew as things didn't improve as he expected.</p>

<p>It only turned into a ponzi because he wasn't as successful at investing as he was telling his investors he was, and telling the truth would have meant the probability that he would have lost most of his clients as they went elsewhere.  Bernie couldn't admit the truth, so he had to keep up the fiction by actually paying out returns that didn't exist, which required constantly finding new money to cover what he was paying out.  The <em>source</em> of that money turned out to be new investors who were lured in by people already investing with Bernie who told them how great he was as a financial wizard, and they had the checks to prove it.</p>

<p>I think this got so far out of hand, and it gradually dragged more and more people in because such things turn into black holes, swallowing up everything that gets close.</p>

<p>Had the 2008 financial crisis not hit then Bernie might still be at it.  The rapid downturns in the markets hit many of Bernie's investors with margin calls in other investments they held, so they requested redemptions from him to cover their calls, expecting that all of the money he'd convinced to leave with him really existed.  When he realized he couldn't meet the flood of redemptions, that was when he 'fessed up and the bubble burst.</p>

<p>Could he have succeeded by simple investing in Berkshire?  Probably.  But then how many people say that in hindsight about them or Amazon or Google, or any number of other stocks that turned out similarly? (grin)  Taking people's money and parking it all in one stock doesn't make you a genius, and that's how Bernie wanted to be viewed.  To accomplish that, he needed to find the opportunities nobody else saw and be the one to get there first.  Unfortunately his personal crystal ball was wrong, and rather than taking his lumps by admitting it to his investors, his pride and ego led him down a path of deception that I'm sure he had every intention of making right if he could.  The problem was, that moment never came.</p>

<p>Keep in mind one thing:  The $64 billion figure everyone cites isn't money that really existed in the first place.  <em>That</em> number is what Bernie claimed his fund was worth, and it is not the amount he actually defrauded people out of.  His actual cash intake was probably somewhere in the $20 billion range over that time.  Everything else beyond that was nothing more than the fictionalized returns he was claiming to get for his clients.  It's what they <em>thought</em> they had in the bank with him, rather than what was really there.</p>

"What percent of the profit do you get from selling a home with a mortgage?","5954","","<p>This is a very simple question, but I've had a hard time finding a simple answer.</p>

<p>Suppose Bob has a home that's worth $100k, with a mortgage, with $50k of the principal paid off (so he still owes the bank $50k for the house). Now say he sells it for $150k. Does the bank get the $50k it's owed, and Bob gets the remaining $100k from the sale?</p>

<p>On the surface, this would seem to make sense: Bob's only in debt for $50k, so that seems like the amount the bank should take. On the other hand, the bank obviously wouldn't have loaned Bob money in the first place if it didn't expect to make money on the loan (in the form of the interest payments).</p>

<p>So how much <em>does</em> the bank get, generally speaking? Is the profit somehow split based on how much principal Bob had paid off before the sale?</p>
","<p>A mortgage is simply a loan backed by a property (and, because it's both very large and very common, covered by some specific laws).  As such, the bank isn't an ""investor"" in your house; it simply is lending you money with the property as collateral.  So, it doesn't get any share of the profit.</p>

<p>As long as you sell the house on your own, for more than you owe, most of the time in the US you will get about 92-94% of the sale price back, minus whatever you owe on the house.  The 6-8% you don't get will go to the realtors as commission (unless you sell by owner <em>and</em> don't sell to someone with a buyer's agent), and to pay some of the costs of the sale (how much of those you pay depends on the deal you make with the buyer, but it's common to pay some of them in some areas).  You also will owe taxes (potentially).  You then pay the bank back from that amount.</p>

<p>As such, in your example, let's say Bob owes $50k on his house, and sells it with a realtor for $150k.  He gets $150k-0.06*150k = 141k after commission.</p>

<p>He then hands the bank a check for the current payoff of the loan: that amount is usually slightly higher than the remaining principal, because you owe the interest that's accrued between [last payment you made] and [day of sale].  Let's say this is a 6% loan, which works out to around 0.5% per month, and it's been half a month since his last payment, so he owes another 0.25%, or another $125.  Some mortgages also may have prepayment penalties (check your note).  In this case there isn't a penalty, so the bank gets $50,125 from the sale.  Usually, the bank would get that immediately at closing - ie, he doesn't get the full $141k or $150k and then write a check, instead the title/closing company gets that amount, and gives the $9k to the realtors, the $50,125 to the bank, and the remaining $90,875 to him.  </p>

<p>Don't forget he may also owe income taxes, and sometimes other local taxes, on the profit on the sale. In this case the IRS wouldn't get anything (as it's under $250k), assuming it's a primary residence, but keep that in mind.</p>

<p>Also - in the case of a foreclosure, the bank will get some extra money to pay for the costs it incurred in foreclosing on and selling the house.</p>

I originally forgot to include daycare expenses for my daughter which would have provided an additional several hundred dollars to my return. I amended my return, but it was rejected because I forgot to include my 1098-T to back up my college expenses. I've found that I don't have receipts to corroborate my expenditures on books, so my amended return would provide &lt; $100. Since I initiated an amended tax return, am I obligated to continue, or will the IRS make me file the amended return or try to audit me? At this point it's not worth my time.</p>
","<p>Answer to question as amended by OP's comment.</p>

<p>Since you did not sign the amended return paperwork, there 
is <em>no</em> amended return that has been submitted to the IRS 
(even if IRS kept a copy of the submitted paperwork in its 
files).</p>

<p>At this point, you have several options.  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>You can just forget the whole thing.  Your accepted return is
your tax return for 2011.  But see below for what acceptance means.</p></li>
<li><p>You can submit a properly signed amended return together
with the 1098-T.  If there are other changes
in your amended return, the IRS will typically accept the
ones that are properly validated and reject the rest.  In this
case, you will get a letter telling you what changes the IRS has 
made to your submitted (amended) return, and what to do
if you disagree with the changes.  If additional tax, interest,
or penalties are due, the IRS will tell you to how to pay the
amount due.</p></li>
<li><p>Note that in the normal scheme of things, once a tax return
(whether original or amended) showing a refund is due
is keyed into the IRS computers, you might get the refund within
a few weeks of submission if no <em>arithmetic errors</em> are found in 
the numbers you submitted.  The IRS will take a closer look at your
return somewhat later, and the letter
saying that upon closer examination, some changes have been
made to your return, might come much later.  When a
tax return is <em>accepted,</em> it merely means 
that the return has been found to have no
obvious numerical errors.  The IRS has three years
from the due date of the original return (including extensions
of time to file, if requested) to examine the return
in detail.  If the return is amended, a new three-year
clock starts from the date of filing the amended return.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>As a final comment, if you amend your Federal return,
you might need to amend your State income tax return also,
so don't forget that part.  If you submitted your
amended return to the State when you sent in your
unsigned Federal amended return, and the State amended return
has been accepted already, then if you
now decide to <em>not</em> amend your Federal return after all,
you will need to file yet another amended State return 
saying put everything back the way it was.</p>

"Is there any reason to buy shares before/after a split?","5929","","<p>I understand the basics of stock splits. My question is, all else being equal is there any benefit to buying shares prior to versus subsequent to a split? As a hypothetical, imagine Apple's price stays the same between now and their split in June. Does it make more sense to buy before June 9th or on-or-after June 9th or does it not make any difference?</p>
","<p>Assuming you plan to buy a whole number of shares and have a maximum dollar value you intend to invest, it may be better to wait for the split if the figures don't quite work out nicely.</p>

<p>For example, if you are going to invest $1,000 and the stock pre-split is $400 and the split is 2 for 1, then you'd buy 2 shares before the split unless you have an extra $200 to add. Meanwhile, after the split you could buy 5 shares at $200 so that you invest all that you intend.</p>

<p>Aside from that case, it doesn't really make a difference since the split is similar to getting 2 nickels for a dime which in each case is still a total value of 10 cents.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The median for all families in the U.S. is just $5,000, and the median
  for families with some savings is $60,000.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I find this very hard to believe. Nobody can retire with 5k in the U.S. The money will be gone within a year. Is it possible? What is the actual figure? </p>

<p>If indeed 5k is an accurate figure, how do 50% of old Americans survive in their old age? Do most old Americans rely on their children for financial support?</p>
","<p>Social security and pensions make up a big part of it.  You may want to look at the source of the data.  If a person, has 5K at Vanguard, 5K at Fidelity and 100K at the bank; Fidelity will report on that person as having only 5K.  Vanguard will do the same.</p>

<p>The opening pitch of a life insurance salesman sometimes includes the ""100 man story"".  Before retirement age:  26% of people will die, 54% will be broke, 5% will work, 4% will be secure, and 1% will be wealthy.  Then they sell you life insurance which is a horrible product for retirement savings.</p>

<p>If you further dig into this subject you will find a great disparity between the mean and median retirement savings.  That is because many Americans have none, and those that do skew the average upward and have no where near mean or average.</p>

<p>Its like this with other things in personal finance.  For example those with actual credit card debt have much higher than the average.  As those with none, or even no credit cards skew the average downward. </p>

<p>In my opinion it is like this because of behavior.  If one saved half of the average car payment over their working life in a growth stock mutual fund, they would make it to that 4% category.  If they also had a good salary, kept debt to a minimum, and saved a healthy amount they would make it to that 1% category.  It was a daily choice that was made many years prior to retirement. </p>

"Is it true that it's better to have bad credit than no credit?","5918","","<p>There's a popular saying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>It's better to have bad credit than no
  credit.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is this true?</p>
","<p>There are flaws in the risk models regarding no credit status. They don't take into account the fact that someone who lives in society and responsibly meets their obligations for years is more likely to pay off loans than someone who has no history of paying off their loans. People with very poor credit will still be able to get some RTO and auto loans, but they pay high interest, and the lender expects collateral property to have value when it's repossessed.</p>

<p>Initial credit is not that difficult to obtain if you plan and put some time into it. A cell phone contract, utility bills and bank accounts (especially those overdraft ""accounts"" that you should opt out of) are ways to establish credit without a credit card. Secured credit cards should be more than sufficient to establish credit within a few years. A No Credit standing can be verified at <a href=""https://www.annualcreditreport.com/cra/index.jsp"">annualcreditreport.com</a>, and should be checked whether you believe you have credit or not because of identity theft concerns.</p>

<p>In summary, it's only better to have bad credit if you want to get a small, high interest loan right now. That's a good way to be even more in debt, and pay lots of money to creditors rather than yourself. If you are patient, good credit is easier to obtain than repairing really bad credit. Either way, you won't be able to get a mortgage for a few years.</p>

"Why are bank transactions not instant?","5918","","<p>I asked myself why bank transactions take 2-6 business days to complete.
How does the internal process of a transaction look like?
Isn't it possible to redesign the process so that transactions are instant?</p>
","<p>If you want your bank to pay $1 to a beneficiary Bob, then the service (no matter how implemented) needs to result in Bob's bank saying to Bob ""Hey, I owe you $1"".   </p>

<p>The usual way how this is done consists of two parts - your bank needs to somehow tell Bob's bank ""hey guys, do us a favor and please give Bob $1 with a message from the sender"", and your bank needs to convince the other bank that they'll pay for (cover) that. This is the main source for the delays in international payments - there are thousands of banks, and most of possible pairs have no legal contact between themselves whatsoever, no bilateral agreements, no trust and no reasonable enforcement mechanism for small claims.</p>

<p>If I'm Bob's bank, then a random bank from anywhere from Switzerland to Nigeria can send me an instruction ""give Bob $1, we'll make it up for you"", the SWIFT network is a common way of doing this. However, most likely I'm going to give Bob the money only after I receive the funds somehow, which means that they have given the money to some institution I work with. For payments within a single country, it often is a centralized exchange or a central bank, and the payment speed is then determined by the details of that particular single payment network - e.g. UK Faster Payments or the various systems used in USA.</p>

<p>For international payments, it may require a chain of multiple intermediaries (correspondent banks) - for example, a payment of $1mm from Kazakhstan to China will likely involve the Kazakhstan bank asking their main correspondent in USA (some major bank such as Chase JPMorgan) to give the money to the relevant chinese bank's correspondent in USA (say, Citi) to then give the money to that chinese bank to then give the money to the actual recipient. Each of those steps can happen because those entities have bilateral agreements, trust and accounts with each other; and each of those steps generally takes time and verification.</p>

<p>If you want <em>all</em> payments to happen instantly, then you need all institutions to join a single binding payment system. It's not as easy as it sounds, as it is a nightmare of jurisdiction - for example, if you'd want me (as Bob's bank) to credit Bob instantly, then the system needs to provide solid guarantees that I would get paid even if (a) the payer institution changes its mind, made a mistake or intentional fraud; (b) the payer institution goes insolvent; (c) the system provider gets insolvent. Providing such guarantees is expensive, they need to be backed by multi-billion capital, and they're unrealistic to enforce across jurisdictions (e.g. would an Iranian bank get recourse if some funds got blocked because of USA sanctions). The biggest such project as far as I know is SEPA, across most of Europe. Visa and MasterCard networks perform the same function - a merchant gets paid by the CC network even if the payer can't pay his CC bill or the paying bank goes insolvent.</p>

"Can I pay past expenses using an FSA opened midyear?","5908","","<p>In my old job I had a HDHP and HSA. Midyear, I started a new job and switched to a standard insurance plan and an FSA.</p>

<p>Can I submit receipts for expenses from January to the FSA that I just opened in October? (These would be expenses I did not use the HSA for).</p>

<p>Relatedly, can I still put money in my HSA until the end of the year? Or did I instantly become ineligible for that the day my new insurance kicked in?</p>
","<p>The FSA can only pay for expenses incurred after it was open.  This also applies in case of a mid-year change in election (such as due to marriage, divorce, child birth, etc.)</p>

<p>For example, according to <a href=""http://www.flexaccounts.com/election.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this page</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can only be reimbursed for qualifying expenses, from the election that was in place at the time the expense was incurred.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, say you had $500 available from January to June, then on July 1 had a qualifying event, you then elected $2000.  You can be reimbursed for up to $500 in expenses incurred prior to July 1, and then an additional $1500 in expenses incurred after (up to $2000 if you didn't use your full $500).</p>

<p>More specifically, from the <a href=""http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">IRS Publication</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Generally, distributions from a health FSA must be paid 
  only to reimburse you for qualified medical expenses you 
  incurred during the period of coverage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>--</p>

<p>The HSA question is more complicated. I would talk to a tax accountant, or at minimum your benefits coordinator.  Also read the publication I linked above, the first part is about HSAs.  The short answer to your specific question: stop contributing to the HSA, unless you were contributing well under the limit of the HSA.  If you know your limit, and you know you're under it, you <em>can</em> continue contributing until April 15 of next year:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you fail to be an eligible individual during 
  2013, you can still make contributions, up until April 15, 
  2014, for the months you were an eligible individual.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The general rule is you can contribute up to <code>(1/12)*(your limit)*(number of months you were eligible)</code>.  So, if you changed jobs Oct 1, and you're single, then you could contribute <code>(3250)*(1/12)*(9)</code>, or just over $2400 in total for the year.  If you've contributed less than that to date, you may continue contributing up to that amount - but again, contact your benefits coordinator or preferably a tax accountant, as the rules can be complicated.</p>

<p>You definitely cannot deduct any expenses from the account that you incur after you are no longer eligible, and the rules on distributions are pretty complicated - and if you get it wrong, you may owe a 10% penalty on top of the tax you would normally owe, so there is significant incentive not to get it wrong.</p>

<p><strong>Can they find out?</strong> Absolutely! <a href=""http://www.whatsmyscore.org/getscore/faq.php"">Answering a question wrong</a> (according to Visa), or in some other way tripping a security alert (such as if the person has intentionally put a ""freeze"" on their account and opted-in to some identity theft protection scheme, <a href=""https://www.experian.com/freeze/center.html"">such as one requiring a special pin</a>), will cause your attempt to fail and often require calling the company directly to provide additional verification information (which of course you may not have and is less predictable). Depending on the <a href=""http://www.money-zine.com/financial-planning/debt-consolidation/credit-report-monitoring/"">monitoring scheme</a>, a monitoring service might even send an email or letter to a person directly if such an attempt is made (but this does vary by service and bureau).</p>

<p>Even if you do it correctly, all requests are logged and often are noted on credit reports regarding past inquiries - so if in the future they run their credit report they may see the inquiry they will know they didn't request (that's weird, this is the first time I've ever checked my credit...). If the person is using a mailing address you don't know about, like a PO Box or a friend's house to get mail (so you don't know about their card/statements/loans), then you will almost certainly lock the account and a fraud alert will be sent in a way you can't intercept.

You can bribe them with getting them a for-fee credit score and analysis at your expense, or extort them by demanding that if they don't like it they can live somewhere else...how you play it is up to you.</p>

<p>But horror stories are easily avoided, and you can use the opportunity to actually get a credit report and sit down and go over it together. Do they know what a report is and what's on it? Most adults twice their age sure don't! </p>

<p><strong>Parenting tip bonus</strong>: if you are open and honest and explain why you'd like to get a credit report and sit down with them to discuss it and they freak out - bingo, you've got an answer that something is wrong and it didn't cost you a dime and you didn't break the law.</p>

<p>Now, <strong><em>to be completely clear</em></strong>, if they don't respond well to the credit report that isn't evidence of some kind of guilt or impropriety (a thanks to the comments for pointing out this potential misinterpretation). However, what it <strong>does</strong> indicate is your relationship may be out of whack - imbalanced or unhealthy in some way. You could be in a co-dependent situation where you are covering for them so they don't have to be responsible or independent (bad for both of you), or they may be hiding from reality, or you may have have developed serious trust and boundary issues that need to be addressed, or any of dozens of other possibilities!</p>

<p>All of  these are possible - they might be really screwing up, or maybe you are, or maybe you both are, or maybe it's all ok and you can relax.

<p>I do not understand this. Is it not the party who sells the products or services that blocks the money? Or is the money being blocked by my bank or by the Visa company?</p>
","<p>It is the people who you bought the ticket from. Blocking is frequently done by hotels, gas stations, or rental car companies. Also, for anything where the credit card might be used to cover any damages or charges you might incur later as part of the transaction.</p>

<p>In essence, they are reserving part of your credit limit, ostensibly to cover charges they reasonably expect you might incur. For example, when you start pumping gas using a credit card they may block out $100 to make sure you don't pump a full tank and your credit card is declined because you ran over your limit at $3. </p>

<p>In general, the blocks clear fairly quickly after you settle up with the company on your final bill. You can also ask the company to clear the block, but I don't think they are required to by law in any specific time period.

"Child care expenses: How much deduction can be claimed on tax return? [Canada]","5791","","<p>How much deduction can be claimed for child care expenses on a Canadian income tax return, for 2009?</p>

<p>Does it vary by province?</p>

<p>Are receipts required to claim a child care expenses deduction?</p>
","<p>Refer to the <strong><a href=""http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pbg/tf/t778/t778-11e.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Information Sheet and Form T778-11E - Child Care Expenses Deduction [PDF]</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Here are the numbers for tax year 2011:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>For a child born in 2005 or later, for whom the disability amount cannot be claimed: <strong>$7,000</strong><br>
<em>(i.e. children <strong>under 7 years old</strong>)</em></p></li>
<li><p>For a child born in 2011 or earlier for whom the disability amount can be claimed: <strong>$10,000</strong><br>
<em>(i.e. a <strong>disabled dependent child, regardless of age</strong>)</em></p></li>
<li><p>For a child born in 1995 to 2004 (and born in 1994 or earlier, with a mental or physical impairment, for whom the disability amount cannot be claimed): <strong>$4,000</strong><br>
<em>(i.e. children <strong>from 7 to 16 years old</strong>)</em></p></li>
</ul>

<p>On the subject of varying by province:  All provinces (and territories) <em>except Québec</em> calculate provincial tax on the basis of the Canadian federal income tax return's <strong>taxable income</strong> (line 260).  And, since child care expenses are a <em>deduction</em> from total income used to arrive at taxable income, the provincial calculations (other than Québec) implicitly use the same deduction.</p>

<p>Details on Québec's own ""refundable tax credit for child care expenses"" can be found here: <a href=""http://www.revenu.gouv.qc.ca/en/citoyen/credits/credits/credit_remb/credit_enfant/conditions.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Revenu Québec - Requirements for claiming the tax credit for child-care expenses</a>.</p>

<p>On the subject of receipts:  <strong>Yes, receipts are required:</strong>  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Supporting documents</strong> – The individual or organization who received the
  payments must give you a receipt showing information about the
  services provided. When the child care services are provided by an
  individual, you will need the social insurance number of the
  individual. Do not send receipts with your return, but keep them in
  case we ask to see them. If you file your return electronically using
  EFILE, show your receipts to your EFILE service provider.

","<p>You do not report the Roth IRA on your 1040 because it has no implication to your current tax situation (as you fund it with after-tax dollars).  Your IRA custodian(s) would report the contributions to the IRS on form <a href=""http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f5498.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">5948</a>, which would then be used to determine if all of your contributions for the tax year were under the Roth IRA limits.</p>

<p>If you did over-contribute, you are subject to a penalty, per year, of 6% of the above-the-limit amount; so if you contributed $6,000, and your limit was $5,500, you may be subject to a penalty of .06*500 or $30 per year until you correct the over-contribution (by withdrawing the over amount plus its portion of the IRA's gains, paying taxes on the gains, and paying any early withdrawal penalties if applicable).

","<p><strong>- In a quote driven market, must every investor trade with a market
       maker? In other words, two parties that are both not market makers

<p>In a way yes, all trades go through a market maker but those trades can be orders put in place by a ""person"" IE: you, or me.</p>

<p><strong>- Does a quote driven market only display the ""best"" bid and ask
       prices proposed by the market makers? In other words, only the
       highest bid price among all the market makers is displayed, and

       only the lowest ask price over all market makers is displayed, and
       other higher ask prices by other market makers are not?</strong></p>

<p>No, you can see other lower bid and higher ask prices.</p>

<p><strong>- In a order-driven market, is it meaningful to talk about ""the current stock price"", which is the price of last transaction?</strong></p>

<p>Well that's kind of an opinion. Information is information so it won't be bad to know it. Personally I would say the bid and ask price is more important. However in the real world these prices are changing constantly and quickly so realistically it is easier to keep track of the quote price and most likely the bid/ask spread is small and the quote will fall in between. The less liquid a security is the more important the bid/ask is. -- This goes for all market types.</p>

<p><strong>- For a specific asset, will there be several transactions happened at
   the same time but with different prices?</strong></p>

<p>Today with electronic markets, trades can happen so quickly it's difficult to say. In the US stock market trades happen one at a time but there is no set time limit between each trade. So within 1 second you can have a trade be $50 or $50.04. However it will only go to $50.04 when the lower ask prices have been exhausted.  </p>

<p><strong>- Does an order driven market have market makers?</strong> </p>

<p>By definition, no.</p>

<p><strong>- What are some examples of quote driven and order driven financial markets, in which investors are commonly trading stocks and derivatives, especially in U.S.?</strong></p>

<p>Quote driven market: Bond market, Forex.</p>

<p>Order driven market: NYSE comes from an order driven market but now would be better classified as a ""hybird market""</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>

<p>If you are asking in order to better understand today's stock markets then these old definitions of Quote market or Order market may not work. The big markets in the real world are neither. (IE: Nasdaq, NYSE...)</p>

<p>The NYSE and Nasdaq are better classified as a ""hybird market"" as they use more then a single tactic from both market types to insure market liquidity, and transparency. Markets these days are strongly electronic, fast, and fairly liquid in most cases.</p>

"Why do credit cards require a minimum annual household income?","5751","","<p>When applying for a new credit card recently, I saw that different cards <a href=""http://www.tdcanadatrust.com/products-services/banking/credit-cards/td-reward-cards/compare-reward.jsp"" rel=""nofollow"">require different amounts</a> of minimum annual household income.</p>

<p>In the link above, for example, a TD Drivers Reward visa requires a minimum household income of $12,000 while a TD Gold Elite visa requires $35,000. I certainly understand that the bank may be unwilling to extend you a <em>credit limit</em> of $100,000 with a household income of $12,000, but given that you could get either card and request, say, a $6000 credit limit, why the differences? Why not base credit limit on your household income, but leave type of credit card entirely to the customer?</p>
","<p>Here's one reason that's being overlooked in answers so far. (@ChrisInEdmonton, this is for your comment on @Chad's answer.)</p>

<p>How do credit card companies make money? Sure, there's interest charges, but those are offset significantly by the cost of borrowing money, and by people defaulting on their debt / entering bankruptcy. The other way they make money is by <strong><em>processing transactions</em></strong>. They get a cut of whatever you buy.</p>

<p>If you're a high-income person, and you're going to process a lot of expenditures with this credit card, your business is worth more. They will be willing to bribe you with things like cash-back, frequent flier miles, and insurance on your auto rentals, so that they can be your #1 go-to card. </p>

<p>(This works in concert with the way that some credit card vendors with richer clientele overall - American Express - get to charge higher merchant fees for access to these customers' wallets. But that was mentioned in other answers.)</p>

<p>If you're not a high-income person, your business is worth less. If you go somewhere asking for credit, they're going to try and give you a card which will earn <strong>them</strong> the most money - which probably isn't the one where they give you back 50% of their transaction fee in rewards. It's a calculated risk, since they still have to compete against cash, debit cards, and all the other credit card companies, so they don't have you totally over a barrel, but you shouldn't expect as many freebies, either.</p>

"Why do most banks in Canada charge monthly fee?","5740","","<p>I am not sure about other countries, but here in the UK we mostly don't need to pay a monthly fee. But I was a bit surprised to learn that most Canadian banks do charge monthly fees that some of them advertise a free first year as a special offer!</p>

<p>It does make sense to me the UK way because banks are making use of our money already to grow their business, so I don't see a justification for taking monthly fees. Yeah, it would make sense to take monthly fees if the banks only save the money for us, but that's not the case; otherwise, the bank will have no business.</p>
","<p>Arguably, ""because they can"". </p>

<p>Canada's banking industry is dominated by five chartered banks who by virtue of their size, pretty much determine how banking is done in Canada. Yes, they have to abide by government regulation, but they carry enough weight to influence government and to some extent shape the regulation they have to follow. While this situation makes Canada's financial system very stable and efficient, it also permits anti-competitive behavior. </p>

<p>There was a time (when U.S. banks were not permitted to operate across state lines) when the smallest of Canada's ""big 5"" was bigger than the biggest U.S. bank, despite our economy having always been about 1/10 the size of the U.S. That scale and their small number gives the ""big 5"" the ability to invest heavily in and collaborate on whatever they decide to be in their own interest.</p>

"Can I use Canada ""permanent"" postage stamps, usually for lettermail, towards higher postage rates?","5725","","<p>For a couple of years, Canada's had ""permanent"" postage stamps, whereby instead of printing a fixed value in cents on the regular lettermail stamp there is simply the letter ""<strong>P</strong>"" for <em>permanent</em>.</p>

<p>You used to buy 1 or 2 cent stamps to make up for any year's price increase if you had stamps left over from the previous year.

<p>My question is:  Can the Canada ""<strong>P</strong>"" stamps be used as part postage when sending other kinds of mail, e.g. internationally, or oversize?  Each of those is a higher postage rate than the ""<strong>P</strong>"" stamp's value.</p>

","<p>Please realize that your issuer can close the account for any number of reasons. </p>

<p>Inactivity is one, as having a credit line open costs them money and if you never charge anything, the company doesn't get any transaction fees from vendors nor does the company get to charge you any interest. An occasional charge is likely to keep your card from being closed automatically, but it is not a guarantee.</p>

<p>Another reason they may close the account is that you have other bad marks show up on your credit score, or their criteria for offering you the card change so you no longer match their target demographic.</p>

<p>I have a credit card issued by my credit union that I have not used for a couple of years. They will not close the card account because my other accounts are still very profitable for them.

<p>In the meantime, we're living paycheck to paycheck and I don't know what to do with the 50K I have inherited (I don't want to squander it).</p>

<p>BTW, we can't buy anything just yet because our credit scores are about 550! Any advice would be appreciated.</p>

<p>I live in California.</p>
","<p>The basic optimization rule on distributing windfalls toward debt is to pay off the highest interest rate debt first putting any extra money into that debt while making minimum payments to the other creditors.</p>

<p>If the 5k in ""other debt"" is credit card debt it is virtually certain to be the highest interest rate debt. Pay it off immediately. Don't wait for the next statement. Once you are paying on credit cards there is no grace period and the sooner you pay it the less interest you will accrue.</p>

<p>Second, keep 10k for emergencies but pretend you don't have it. Keep your spending as close as possible to what it is now.</p>

<p>Check the interest rate on the auto loan v student loans. If the auto loan is materially higher pay it off, then pay the remaining 20k toward the student loans.</p>

<p>Added this comment about credit with a view towards the OP's future:</p>

<p>Something to consider for the longer term is getting your credit situation set up so that should you want to buy a new car or a home a few years down the road you will be paying the lowest possible interest.</p>

<p>You can jump start your credit by taking out one or two secured credit cards from one of the banks that will, in a few years, unsecure your account, return your deposit, and leave no trace you ever opened a secured account. That's the route I took with Citi and Wells Fargo. While over spending on credit cards can be tempting, they are, with a solid payment history, the single most important positive attribute on a credit report and impact FICO scores more than other type of credit or debt. So make an absolute practice of only using them for things you would buy anyway and always, always, pay each monthly bill in full.</p>

<p>This one thing will make it far easier to find a good rental, buy a car on the best terms, or get a mortgage at good rates.</p>

<p>And remember: Credit is not equal to debt. Maximize the former and minimize the latter.</p>

","<p>Your #1 is essentially correct except that the doubling of the SS tax rate is actually two different taxes in equal amounts; the SS tax that you pay as an employee (of yourself) and the SS tax that your employer (you again!) pays on the wages paid to an employee. 
Both of these taxes are computed on <a href=""http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040sse.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Schedule SE</a> (as well as the employee's and employer's
share of Medicare taxes) and included in the amount that you list on page 2 of Form 1040 
as self-employment taxes that are due.</p>

<p>On the other hand, you get to deduct half of the SS 
(and Medicare) tax computed on Schedule SE from your income in arriving at your Adjusted Gross Income (AGI), and hence from taxable income.</p>

<p>To ameliorate matters a little more,
you (as an employer) don't need to issue a W-2 form to yourself (as an employee)

each of the <em>other</em> employers paying you W-2 wages 
must withhold Social Security taxes until the wages that <em>each</em> is paying exceeds
the limit, without regard to what any other employer (including you) might be paying
you.</p>

<p>The excess withholding, if any, gets credited to you  on your Form 1040
(thus reducing the income tax due or increasing the refund). To the best of my

Social Security tax that they paid to the IRS on the wages that they paid you.</p>

<pre><code>+---+-----------------+----------------+-------+
|Yrs| Monthly Payment | Interest Saved | Ratio |
+---+-----------------+----------------+-------+
| 2 | $1,576.89       | $7,467.49      | 4.74  |
| 3 | $1,061.26       | $5,530.73      | 5.21  |

</code></pre>

<p>The first two columns give the time frame (in years) in which all loans would be paid off using the given monthly payment amount. The third column gives the amount of interest saved compared to choosing the standard 10-year repayment plan. The last column gives the ratio of Interest Saved / Monthly Payment.</p>

<p>My interpretation of the ratio column is that a higher ratio combines the best total interest savings amount with the lowest monthly repayment amount. In other words, I could choose to pay <strong>$1,576.89</strong> each month (about <strong>42%</strong> of my take-home pay each month) for <strong>2 years</strong> and maximize interest savings...or I could pay <strong>$659.94</strong> per month (about <strong>17%</strong> of my take-home pay) for <strong>5 years</strong>, which loses me <strong>$2,668.04</strong> in total but gives me a much healthier budget for other things each month.</p>

<hr>

<p>So...</p>

<ol>
<li>Do these figures look reasonably correct?</li>
<li>Am I overcomplicating this? Should I go with the 5-year plan I described, or try to pay as high a monthly payment as I can realistically afford each month?</li>
</ol>
","<p>As you noticed, there are diminishing returns on the interest savings as you get closer to paying off the loan.  Certainly, the quicker you pay off the loan, the more interest you save.  However, the total interest under the normal <a href=""http://www.bankrate.com/calculators/mortgages/mortgage-calculator.aspx?loanAmount=34558&amp;years=10.000&amp;terms=120&amp;interestRate=4.877&amp;loanStartDate=18+Jan+2016&amp;show=true&amp;showRt=false&amp;prods=388&amp;monthlyAdditionalAmount=0&amp;yearlyAdditionalAmount=0&amp;yearlyPaymentMonth=+Jan+&amp;oneTimeAdditionalPayment=0&amp;oneTimeAdditionalPaymentInMY=+Feb+2016&amp;ic_id=mtg_calc_amortization_btn"">10 year terms</a> is fixed at $9178, and you can't save more interest than that.  Therefore, the rate of increase of the interest savings gets smaller and smaller with each month you take off the loan period.  This becomes more obvious when you look at the numbers at the far end of the scale:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.bankrate.com/calculators/mortgages/mortgage-calculator.aspx?loanAmount=34558&amp;years=0.500&amp;terms=6&amp;interestRate=4.877&amp;loanStartDate=18+Jan+2016&amp;show=true&amp;showRt=false&amp;prods=388&amp;monthlyAdditionalAmount=0&amp;yearlyAdditionalAmount=0&amp;yearlyPaymentMonth=+Jan+&amp;oneTimeAdditionalPayment=0&amp;oneTimeAdditionalPaymentInMY=+Feb+2016&amp;ic_id=mtg_calc_amortization_btn"">6 months</a>; Monthly Payment: $5842; Total Interest: $493; Interest Saved: $8685; Ratio: 1.49</li>
<li>1 payment; Monthly Payment: $34588; Total Interest: $0; Interest Saved: $9178; Ratio: 0.27</li>
</ul>

<p>To go from 6 month repayment to 1 month payment, your payment amount has gone up 6 times, but the difference in interest savings is only $493.</p>

<p>As for what you should do, it really depends on what your goals are.  There are many people that do not like being in debt.  Their goal is to become debt free as fast as possible.  So if that person was comparing the 5 year plan to the 2 year plan, he might notice that the difference is $2688 in interest, but the important difference to him is 3 years.  He has a big payment for 2 years, but is completely debt free after that.  The sacrificing in the budget might be tough, but after 2 years, he can do whatever he wants with that extra income.</p>

<p>Looking at it another way, if you go with the 5 year plan, paying less on your loan and having more room in your budget, what do you plan to do with that extra money?  If you plan your budget/lifestyle with the $1577 monthly payment, you will live more frugally, and in 2 years when the loan is done, you will have an extra $1577 that you were not used to spending that you can do whatever you want with.  If, instead, you plan your budget around the $660 payment, you will become accustomed to spending more money, and in 5 years when the loan is finished, you will only gain $660 in the budget.</p>

<p>Paying the debt as fast as possible encourages thrift.</p>

"How can I check whether old foreign currency paper bills or coins still have value / considered legal tender?","5701","","<p>Collectible value aside, let's say I have some old currency &ndash; bank notes and coins &ndash; from another country, perhaps acquired from a relative who visited many years ago.</p>

","<p>This is usually a piece of information obtainable from the central/government bank of that country. Each country has its own laws, and each currency release has its own laws.
I've lived in a place that changed bills to coins, and the bills can still be returned to any bank for replacement, but are not considered ""legal tender"" in the sense that you can go and buy stuff with them (anyone who is not a bank has a right not to accept them as money). Same country had a currency change 10 years prior (not just bills, the whole currency including the currency name), and the old bills are no longer valid and cannot be exchanged (I have some left).</p>

<p>So to answer your question directly - central bank of that country (if it exists, if it doesn't the currency is probably just a collectible item).</p>

"Dad gifting me a house for 2 years, how to deal with taxes?","5680","","<p>My dad is moving to Florida. He loves the house he has in New York. He wants it to stay in the family but I can't quite afford the mortgage yet. I have a wealthy cousin who said he'd hold the NY house for us for 2 years by purchasing my dad's house in Florida and have my dad just gift me the NY house. (Following?) </p>

<ul>
<li>House is worth <code>$430k</code> and my dad purchased it 30+ years ago for
<code>$97k</code></li>
<li>My wife and I plan to live in the house for the next 10+ years</li>
</ul>

<p>I have 2 years to be able to afford the mortgage and give my cousin/dad the money back. Here is my understanding:</p>

<ol>
<li>He files a 709 gift form (I understand <code>$14k/yr $5.4M max</code>)</li>
<li>My dad then puts the title of the house in my name</li>
<li>In two years, I take a mortgage out on the house for the full amount </li>
<li>I give my cousin/dad <code>$430k</code> from the mortgage</li>
<li>Live happily ever after</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Where are the tax warnings in all of this? </li>
<li>Is it true that I don't pay capital gains if I lived in the house for 2+ years and sell it for more than the <code>$430k</code>?</li>
<li>Will a bank be willing to take out a mortgage on a house that I technically own for the full amount?</li>
<li>What do I need a lawyer to do?</li>
</ul>

<p>Edits to answer questions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why doesn't he just buy the NY house and rent it to you? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Insurance would go up for me if I couldn't get the multi-line discount. The taxes would be in HIS name and property taxes would go up. He also doesn't want to be bothered by collecting rent.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are you and your dad married? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both my dad and I are married... to wives, not each other. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can your dad sell it to you for what you can afford, or does he need the full $430k to buy the FL house (hence the cousin's involvement)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He needs the full amount for the home in Florda. </p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>I understand $14k/yr $5.4M max</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn't the right way to say it.  Your dad has a $5.4 million estate tax exclusion that can be used for gift tax.  In addition to that (not instead or as part of), he and his wife each have a $14k/year gift tax exclusion.  So if you aren't paying for two years from today, you actually have three years of gift tax exclusion:  2017; 2018; 2019.  So that's <code>3 * 2 * $14k = $84k</code> that he (and his wife) can give you without using any of the estate tax exclusion.  But </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I give my cousin/dad $430k from the mortgage</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to this, you don't want your dad to give you any money.  You want to pay the entire $430k.  In that case, don't file gift tax forms.  He's not giving you money.  He's loaning you money.  </p>

<p>I agree with the others.  The cleanest solution is for your cousin to loan you money to buy the house from your dad.  Pay a lawyer (or have your cousin/dad do it) so that it's legally written as a mortgage and you can get your interest deduction.  You start paying off the loan in two years.  Until then, interest accrues.  So instead of a $430k debt, you'd owe something like $470k.  Maybe more if your cousin pays the property taxes as well.  </p>

<p>Your cousin is out $430k plus possibly property taxes, but apparently he can afford that.  You have a house and a mortgage.  Your dad has money to buy his Florida house.  </p>

<p>Note that if your dad wanted to give you money, he could.  He could collect $346k from you (borrowed from your cousin) and give you $28k equity immediately and then two more payments in 2018 and 2019.  But that assumes that $346k is enough for him to buy his Florida house.  If not, just do the mortgage.  He can give you money by check which you can send to your cousin if he wants to do that.  </p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","<p>It is a good idea to keep the receipts.
The reason being that the dispensation from the ATM and the debit to the account are async process. There are multiple handshakes during this process between the hardware of the ATM, the software controlling the ATM and the core banking software.
like any software programming, there are chances of errors, ie amounts being debit wrong due to bugs, or duplicate of transactions being posted.
Altough such errors would normally get caught during recon between the ATM software and the Core Banking postings, its advisable to keep the receipts and verify erroneous debits. In such cases, the receipts would provide additional information required by the Bank to rectify the errors promptly.</p>

<p>It <em>doesn't</em> cost XYZ this second. The market price only reflects the last price at which the security traded. It doesn't mean that if you'll get that price when you place an order. The price you get if/when your order is filled is determined by the bid/ask <em>spreads.</em></p>

<p>Someone may be willing to sell at an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ask_price#Stock_exchange"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ask price</a> of $47 simply because that's the best price they think they can sell the security for. Keep in mind that the ""someone"" may be a computer that determined that $47 is a reasonable ask price.</p>

<p>Remember that bid/ask spreads aren't fixed, and there can be <em>multiple</em> bid/ask prices in a market at any given time. Your buy order was filled because at the time, someone else in the market was willing to sell you the security for the same price as your <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bid_price"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bid price</a>. Your respective buy/sell orders were matched based on their price (and volume, conditional orders, etc).</p>

"Why use credit when you have the cash?","5665","","<p>I've heard several people state that they get loans even when they have the money to cover the cost in the bank, and it befuddles me why they would pay interest instead of using their own money.</p>

<p>This seems especially true in small business where I hear people say that business runs on revolving credit.</p>

<p>Why do people choose to pay to use someone else's money when they could use their own?</p>
","<p>There are a few reasons, particularly for businesses.</p>

<p>The first is <strong>opportunity cost</strong>. That chunk of money they have could be used to get higher returns somewhere else. If they can borrow from a bank at low interest rates to finance their ongoing operations, they can use their cash to get a higher return somewhere else.</p>

<p>The second is <strong>credit rating</strong>. For public companies, ratings companies give high emphasis to companies with large reserves. This strengthens their ability to pay back the loan should it become necessary. A good credit rating in turn let's the company borrow money at lower rates. When a company can borrow money at low rates, it circles back to the first point where they can now put their reserves to better use.</p>

<p>The third is <strong>leverage</strong>. Companies can use the cash they have built up to leverage into a larger investment. Assuming the investment works out, it will pay for the cost of borrowing over time. For instance let's say I have $1 million to invest. I can pay all cash for a $1 million apartment building or I can leverage that into a $3 million building. Assuming I run it well, the tenants will pay for the cost of borrowing $2 million and at the end of the term I'll be left with my $3 million building.</p>

Am I doing something wrong?","5658","","<p>I am a graduate student and I receive a stipend that pays my living expenses, through a national fellowship that I was awarded. The fellowship never withholds taxes of any kind, and so I have been making quarterly estimated payments throughout the year. This is the second year of paying taxes with this fellowship, so I've done this once before, but this year things seem odd.</p>

<p>I earned roughly $31,000 in income from this fellowship (monthly stipends of around $2600). This was reported to me on a 1099-misc form in box 3 ""other income.""</p>

<p>When I fill out my information in the web-portal through H&amp;R Block, however, it says that my base taxes owed are about $6500. This works out to be almost a 21% tax rate, which doesn't seem plausible for someone earning such a small amount and working only as a full-time student. </p>

<p>But I can't see where my error might be coming from. I just put in the information as if it was from a Schedule C (this is what the H&amp;R Block interface suggested that I do). I believe it is treating me as though I qualify for some very high ""self-employment"" tax rate. But I don't think this can be correct because I'm not really self-employed. This just happens to be the manner in which my funding agency delivers their tax data (basically just so they can avoid worrying about deducting taxes from student stipends across many states and in many unique situations).</p>

<p>My tax rate certainly wasn't this high last year, but I filled out the H&amp;R Block online forms exactly the same way.</p>

<p>Any suggestions on what's going wrong / how I should report this?</p>

<p><strong>Added</strong></p>

<p>When I read the tax document provided by my funding agency, it specifically says that I am treated as an independent contract, <em>but not self-employed</em>. That's the specific wording. How do I communicate that I am being paid as an independent contractor, but that I am not supposed to be paying the self-employment tax? (I'm fairly sure this kind of arrangement is common for science fellowships and research grants.. that is, you're not taxed for self-employment (a silly thing to do to a student already barely able to pay bills... why would they accept the fellowship and earn less than peers who don't accept fellowships?), but you do receive a 1099-misc).</p>
","<p>according to this <a href=""http://www.aktcpa.com/assets/blogger/ohsu-phd-presentation-combined.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">presentation</a> (page 13)</p>

<p>The current ruling is that you DO NOT have to pay the SE taxes.</p>

<p>Here is a <a href=""http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-wd/0113020.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">link</a> to the actual IRS ruling.</p>

<p>I would suggest manually entering the amount in the other income line of form 1040 (line 21) with FELLOWSHIP as the explanation, but perhaps someone else has a better solution.</p>

"Which is better: Employer-sponsored HSA or opening an HSA individually?","5654","","<p>So I know that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Employer-sponsored HSA's allow you to deduct contributions directly from your paycheck, pre-tax</li>
<li>With individual HSAs, you must contribute using post-tax dollars, then deduct those contributions from your taxable income when you do your taxes</li>
</ul>

<p>Given those facts, I guess it's marginally better to use an employer-sponsored HSA because it means the government doesn't temporarily hold on to your taxed income, only to return it later after you do your taxes; you could theoretically put that money to work in an investment vehicle instead of having the government hold it hostage for a while.</p>

<p>But are there any other benefits (either way) that I'm not aware of? The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_savings_account"">HSA Wikipedia page</a> kind of threw me with the following statement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The main advantage of making pre-tax contributions is the Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax (FICA) and Medicare Tax deduction, which amounts to a savings of 7.65% each to the employer and employee (subject to limits of the Social Security Wage Base).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I'm not really sure what that's telling me.</p>

<p>My employer is offering an HSA, <strong>but is not offering to contribute to the HSA or match my contributions</strong>. So if it's all pretty much the same, I'd rather use the bank of my choosing and manage it privately.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
","<p>The big difference for me is that my contribution thorough a cafeteria plan also skips Social Security and Medicare taxes. That is a 6.2% (SS) + 1.45% (Medicare) tax on those contributions if done outside a cafeteria plan.</p>

<p>Some companies make a contribution to a the HSA. If you handle your contributions outside of their channels they may see you as a non-participant, and not make any matching contributions. You might have to put a minimum amount into the company setup HSA. </p>

<p>The non-company HSA may also charge fees that the company one doesn't.</p>

<p><strong>Regarding the taxes:</strong>
If you contribute $3,000 to the HSA via post tax, your paychecks would have had an extra $229.50 paid into social security/Medicare. There is no mechanism to get this refunded.</p>

<p>EDIT: My tax advisor says that you can withdraw only one time / yr without penalty. More than once, and there will be penalty</p>

<p>There is no penalty for withdrawing money from a TFSA as such. You can withdraw from it at any time. The only restriction is that you can't put the money you took out back in the same year (unless you have sufficient contribution room for it to be considered an additional contribution). <a href=""https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/examples-tfsa-contribution-room.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This scenario</a> explains it.</p>

<p>There may be penalties for withdrawing money from the <strong>investment vehicle</strong> into which you paid the TFSA contents. For example your TFSA contents may be in a mutual fund, or in an interest-bearing savings account. If those have restrictions on how much you can withdraw, or have penalties for withdrawl, then you will have to abide by the rules and pay any penalties.</p>

"Is the Investopedia simulator an accurate representation of real stock trading?","5638","","<p>I've been trying out trading stocks on Investopedia, and I made a decent, consistent rate of return. I'm wondering if the simulator is accurate of real stock trading? What factors between the two would be different, and would the differences negatively impact my results</p>

<p>edit: I also wonder if the volume impacts my trading as well..usually on the simulator my trades almost always go through at the price I want..is it the same in real life?</p>
","<p>Using any simulator will never be exactly the same as real trading.  One reason is that a simulator will always execute your trades at the exact price you want, but that may not always happen in real life.</p>

<p>For example, if you place a limit order to buy 1000 shares of a stock at 10.50, and the price drops down to exactly 10.50, then the simulator will execute your trade and you will have 1000 shares at 10.50.  But in real life, the price of the stock may drop to 10.50, but other people may have buy orders ahead of you.  If the price of the stock drops to 10.50 but then starts going up again, you may not get all the shares that you wanted (or you may not even get any shares at all) due to the fact that people were ahead of you.</p>

<p>In real trading there is also <a href=""http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/slippage.asp"" rel=""noreferrer"">slippage</a>, which you don't see in a simulator.  For example, if you have a stop order to sell 1000 shares of a stock if it drops to 7.50, then the simulator will sell all 1000 shares at 7.50 if the price drops to 7.50.  But in real trading, if the price drops to 7.50, then you may not be able to sell all 1000 shares at 7.50 if there's not enough liquidity or the market is moving very fast.  You may end up selling 100 shares at 7.50, 100 shares at 7.49, 100 shares at 7.48, 50 shares at 7.47, 50 shares at 7.46, 200 shares at 7.45, and 400 shares at 7.44.</p>

<p>Another thing is that you don't experience the emotional aspect of trading with a simulator.  If you buy a stock in a simulator and it goes down, it's not real money, so you may be more willing to hold it and wait for it to come back up.  But if you are trading real money and the stock goes down, you may not be so willing to hold if it goes down.  You may be more apt to sell the stock for a small loss before the loss gets too big.</p>

"How does mortgage payoff work logistically?","5614","","<p>Let's say I am in a position to pay off a mortgage. I understand that there is a ""payoff amount"" that may not correspond to my balance due to various escrow and interest calculations. What I'm not clear on is how the process actually works in terms of sending in money and scheduling. Here are my sub-questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Does the process basically just involve sending in money or are there other documents that must be exchanged?</li>
<li>Is the payoff usually paid with a regular check or with a cashier's check, bank wire, etc.?</li>
<li>I see that a payoff amount is associated with a particular date, presumably because of interest calculations. Does this imply that checks are usually send by overnight delivery in order for them to arrive exactly on the designated date, and what happens if they arrive late?</li>
<li>Let's say my mortgage balance is $4500, and my monthly payment is usually $1000. What would happen if I just continued to pay monthly bills instead of requesting a final payoff? Would the mortgage company eventually send me a final bill that would work like a final payoff?</li>
</ol>
","<p>Start the process by contacting the company that services the mortgage. They can answer all your questions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Does the process basically just involve sending in money or are
  there other documents that must be exchanged?</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>They should have a form that needs to be submitted. You will want to get from them the most up-to-date payoff amount X days from now. The amount changes each day.</p>

<p>They will be sending you a document signifying that the debt has been met. They will also be filing paperwork with the county/city/township releasing the property from the mortgage obligation. </p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Is the payoff usually paid with a regular check or with a cashier's
  check, bank wire, etc.?</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Because all my mortgage payoffs have either been or refinancing or I have sold the property, the balance due was significant and the lender required a cashiers check. Contact them to ask. If it only a few thousand left they might take a regular check.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>I see that a payoff amount is associated with a particular date, presumably because of interest calculations. Does this imply that
  checks are usually send by overnight delivery in order for them to
  arrive exactly on the designated date, and what happens if they arrive
  late?</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Sending the checks via overnight delivery speeds up the process, and cuts down on the uncertainty of the delivery date. Ask for a return receipt so that you have proof of the date it was received. Overpay by a couple of days. They will refund the overage.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Let's say my mortgage balance is $4500, and my monthly payment is usually $1000. What would happen if I just continued to pay monthly
  bills instead of requesting a final payoff? Would the mortgage company
  eventually send me a final bill that would work like a final payoff?</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>If you let the mortgage run its course, you will still get a document back from them; they will still file the documents with the local government; and they will refund any overage. If you look at the coupon book, or the paperwork they gave you at settlement the last payment is usually a different amount due to rounding of the monthly payments. </p>

<p>Of course if you have been making extra payments or larger than required payments the numbers on the original coupon book are moot so contact the company for the last payment amount.</p>

"What are the costs to establish an LLC and to maintain it?","5604","","<p><strong>What's the average (approximately) cost to open a basic LLC in Florida state or in NY state?</strong> (FYI in my case is to buy an house in Miami and rent it. I already have a bank account in the U.S.)</p>

<p><strong>What's the average cost to maintain it?</strong> I mean accounting + bookeeping + tax filing costs, etc.</p>

<p>Side questions: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>If I come to Florida or NY state., where do I generally have to go to open/maintain an LLC? Here
in Italy we usually ask a CPA (Certified Public Accountant) /
tax advisors. Where do I look for them? On the web? What do I need to
look for: ""CPAs"" or ""Tax Advisors"" or ""Lawyers""?</p></li>
<li><p>How much paper work do I have to do every year to keep my LLC
running? Do people in US usually do this on
their own, or do they go to places like lawyers or CPAs to manage
the LLC book-keeping/accounting/tax-filing and all the paperwork.</p>

<p>(<strong>I
would like to be sure I do not make errors. I don't want to end up
in jail just because I forgot to pay taxes or added nondeductible costs to the economic income.</strong>)</p>

<p>For instance: I have a small company in Italy and every 3 months I
have to bring cost/revenues invoices to the CPA. The CPA registers them
and at the end of the year he does the tax filing. So basically he
takes care of all the paper work/accounting/tax-filing, etc.</p></li>
</ol>
","<ol>
<li><p>The cost will be around $300-$500 if you do it correctly it in Florida and can be over a $1,000 if you do it in New York (New York is more expensive due to a publication requirement that New York has for LLC’s). 
The price ranges I’ve given include filing, state fees, getting a tax ID number (EIN), operating agreement, membership certificates, registered agent fees and publication fees if done in New York.</p>

<p>Each state also have licensing boards and city fees that are applicable, so you would want to also make sure that you are keeping compliant there.</p></li>
<li><p>Yearly paperwork to keep the LLC running won’t be so expensive, expect the state to charge a yearly fee and require some basic information to be submitted.  I had a quick look at Florida, and with someone filing it for you, expect around $200 to $250 a year, plus registered agent fees.  If you are late in Florida the penalty is $400 so you definitely would want a service that provides compliance calendar notifications to make sure you are on time with fees.</p>

<p>In regards to bookkeeping and taxes, yearly tax filing will start at $250 to $500 for an LLC and move up from there depending on the services being offered and the amount of time of work.  I recently referred someone to an accountant that will charge $250 to file an almost zero tax return on an LLC.  I think $40 an hour is a little low for a bookkeeper but it all depends on where you are.  I know in some major cities bookkeepers expect $75 an hour or higher. So the expectation in Miami and Manhattan will probably be more expensive than Jacksonville and Albany. If you doing a little business don’t expect the cost to be too much on the bookkeeping.</p>

<p>So, breakdown:</p>

<p>$300-$500 (FL) - $1,000 (NY) Registration of LLC + any business license, city or other registrations</p>

<p>$250 Yearly Fee + Yearly Registered Agent + any business licenses, city or other fee</p>

<p>$500 Tax Return + Bookkeeping Fee</p>

<p>Banks will charge more than a personal account so expect $120 a year plus.</p>

<p>In regards to service I would look at companies that specialize in foreigners setting up  businesses in the US, because they will have services designed to help you more than services that primarily specialize with US clients. You are going to have some different needs, based on not having a Social Security Number or establishing from overseas. </p></li>

"When do I need to pay interest on my short sell position?","5588","","<p>For example, if I deposited $3000 into the account, and I short sell $3000 worth of VXX(a non-dividend paying etf). Do I need to pay any interest on my short sell position in this case?</p>
","<p>Yes, you pay interest, but the interest is applied to the price of the underlying shorted not the amount of cash proceeds of the sale since the underlying is what's borrowed not underlying.  The interest will increase the value of the short liability and will contribute to a diminishing maintenance margin.</p>

<p>The cash is posted as collateral, so the net of interest charged by borrowing the underlying less the interest received from the cash collateral is what's paid.  Sometimes, when there is no demand to short a particular underlying, and a broker passes these rates through less a fee, the loan balance can actually decrease because the interest received from the cash collateral exceeds the interest paid on the underlying.</p>

<p>While interest is charged and applied daily between brokers, the broker may charge this on nearly any basis they please.</p>

<p>When is it wise or unwise to open a line of credit?</p>
","<p>With the information you have given, I would say never. Remember the banker is a salesman, and the line of credit is the product. If you don't need to borrow the money for something specific, then you don't need the line of credit in the first place. Even if you did need something I would tell you to save up and pay cash for it.</p>

<p><strong>On the tax advantage:</strong> There is none, in the US you can deduct your mortgage interest on your taxes but it's not a tax credit it's a tax deductions. Let me explain further:</p>

<p>You spend $10,000 on mortgage interest, and you're in the 25% tax bracket.</p>

<p>You send the bank $10,000 in return you get at tax savings of $2500.</p>

<p>You are still in the hole $7500</p>

<p>You would have been better off not taking out the loan in the first place.</p>

<p><strong>On the Emergency Fund</strong>: You should have 3 - 6 months of expenses in cash, like a money market account. </p>

<p>This money isn't for investing, it's like insurance, and you don't make money on insurance. The last thing you want to do is have to go into debt right in the middle of an emergency. Say you lost your job, the last thing you would want to do is borrow money, right at the time you have no income to pay it back. The bank is under no obligation to maintain you credit limit and can without notice reduce it, they can in most cases call the loan balance due in full with little or no notice as well. Both of those are likely scenarios if the bank were to become aware of the fact that you were unemployed.</p>

I live in Raleigh, NC with about 3-4 dependents.  Roughly how much could I expect to be making an 80 hr pay period after taxes?</p>
","<p>There are way too many details missing to be able to give you an accurate answer, and it would be too localized in terms of time &amp; location anyway -- the rules change every year, and your local taxes make the answer useless to other people.</p>

<p>Instead, here's how to figure out the answer for yourself.</p>

<p>Use a tax <strong>estimate</strong> calculator to get a ballpark figure. (And keep in mind that these only provide <strong>estimates</strong>, because there are still a lot of variables that are only considered when you're actually filling out your real tax return.) There are a number of calculators if you search for something like ""tax estimator calculator"", some are more sophisticated than others. (Fair warning: I used several of these and they told me a range of $2k - $25k worth of taxes owed for a situation like yours.)</p>

<p>Here's an estimator from <a href=""http://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tools/calculators/taxcaster/?s=1"" rel=""nofollow"">TurboTax</a> -- it's handy because it lets you enter business income. When I plug in $140K ($70 * 40 hours * 50 weeks) for business income in 2010, married filing jointly, no spouse income, and 4 dependents, I get $30K owed in federal taxes. (That doesn't include local taxes, any itemized deductions you might be eligible for, IRA deductions, etc. You may also be able to claim some expenses as business deductions that will reduce your taxable business income.) So you'd net $110K after taxes, or about $55/hour ($110k / 50 / 40).</p>

<p>Of course, you could get an answer from the calculator, and Congress could change the rules midway through the year -- you might come out better or worse, depending on the nature of the rule changes... that's why I stress that it's an <strong>estimate</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: (some additional info)</p>

<p>If you plan on doing this on an ongoing basis (i.e. you are going into business as a contractor for this line of work), there are some tax shelters that you can take advantage of. Most of these won't be worth doing if you are only going to be doing contract work for a short period of time (1-2 years). These may or may not all be applicable to you.</p>

<p>And do your research into these areas before diving in, I'm just scratching the surface in the notes below.</p>

<ul>
<li>Retirement plan. You can set up an Individual 401(k) account and stash ""up to"" $49k tax-free (you wouldn't qualify for this much though). Or you can open a SEP IRA (which is a bit cheaper and simpler to set up), and save around $35k tax-free.</li>
<li>Health care. You don't mention if you have a spouse who works, and if you have health care through that employment. If you get a high-deductible health plan and establish a Health Savings Account, the premiums for the insurance should be deductible, and you can save up to $6150 in the HSA which is deductible. (To be clear, I think the health care premiums you pay are deductible whether you have HDHP+HSA or not, but check with your accountant first.)</li>
<li>Disability insurance. It will take you a couple of years to have a track record before you'll be able to buy it, but disability insurance premiums may be deductible. Be sure to talk to your accountant first, though, because choosing to deduct these premiums can have large consequences in the event that you need to collect on this insurance.</li>

","<p>You will pay at your top marginal rate in general, but there are a couple of other factors that may add to the tax:</p>

<ol>
<li>This additional income may bump you into the next tax bracket, in which case you'll pay a higher marginal rate on the portion that falls into that next higher bracket.</li>
<li>You probably have to pay self-employment tax in addition, which will mean ""both halves"" of your social security and medicare. (For people with ""regular"" jobs getting a W-2, the employer pays SS and Medicare as a payroll tax in addition to what they withhold from your paycheck.)</li>
<li>If you're sufficiently underpaid on your tax, then you may have to pay some interest in addition to just the tax.</li>
</ol>

<p>Without knowing too much about your situation, 46% doesn't sound crazy since you said you're in the 25% bracket and the combined rate for SS and Medicare is 15.3%, which already puts you around 40.3% just based on my bullet #2 above.</p>

"What Was ""A Lot of Money"" In 1971?","5567","","<p>In 1971 before the United States left the gold standard, the median home price was approximately $24,000.  Now, the median home price is approximately $180,000.</p>

<p>For people who were alive then and remember the zeitgeist, what was considered ""a lot of money"" then, like my generation tends to think about one million dollars being ""a lot of money""?</p>

<p>Or, more precisely - what would have put a person in the top 10% of incomes a year in those days?</p>
","<p>To answer your specific question about income, the answer is: about <strong>$20,000</strong> (or a little less) in yearly income put you in the top 10% of income earners in the United States in 1970. This information is provided by <a href=""https://www2.census.gov/prod2/popscan/p60-104.pdf"">this US Census Document</a> (PDF page 13, labeled as page 11, table 1, document entitled ""Household Money Income in 1975 and Selected Social and Economic Characteristics of Households""). </p>

<p>The census data also has a breakdown by race of head of household, and note that this is household income and not individual income (so 2 income households are included in this data, though 2-income families were more rare then than today). Median income was around $9,000 per year at this time, so a little more than double the average family would put you in the top 10%. There was also much less inequality in both income and wealth during this time period as compared to now.</p>

<p>To <a href=""http://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/demo/tables/p60/252/table3.pdf"">compare this to the 2014 census</a>, and you'll need a household income over <strong>$150,000</strong> to get into the top 10%. Note that this link also shows 1970 information, but everything is inflation adjusted to make it more easily comparable dollar-for-dollar - sort of.</p>

<h2>What Was ""One Million Dollars"" In 1970? About $100,000 (by income -sort of)</h2>

<p>If you are a top-10% earner with a yearly income of $150,000 now, 1 million bucks is a little less than 7 years of income. If we apply this multiple to 1970s income of $20,000 per year, that means that 7 years of income is $140,000. </p>

<p>So I suppose in a very rough estimate sort of way, you could say that $100,000 in 1970 is kind of like $1,000,000 today - about 7 years of income if you are just barely making enough to be in the top 10% of wage earners.</p>

<h2>Why Not Use Inflation?</h2>

<p>The problem with inflation is it is generally defined in terms of a specific ""market basket"" of consumer goods, to try to compare general buying power over time. The problem is that this is a really rough, problematic estimate, because things change in price relative to each other over time. JoeTaxpayer makes a very good point about interest rates and houses, and another example is consumer electronics. Not only are today's electronics actually cheaper than they use to be, but they are difficult to compare at all because they are more powerful and useful than ever before. Similarly, cars are safer, have less emissions, and are more fuel efficient - so a simple inflation calculation based on macroeconomic changes can provide a very distorted and inaccurate picture.</p>

<p>It's up to you if you think an income-based estimate is more helpful to you in actual 1970s dollar amounts, or if you'd prefer to think costs and use measures of inflation as your guide.</p>

<h2>Side Note: Income Inequality Has Changed a Lot Since 1970</h2>

<p>In 1970, half of households made more than $10,000 a year and only 4% made over $25,000 (more than 2.5X as much as the median). In 2014 about half of households make over $50,000 a year, while 5% make over $200,000 a year (more than 4X as much as the median). These numbers are all rounded to convenient numbers, but the reason I mention this is that the difference in the top 10% of wage earners now compared to the ""average"" American is far greater (in absolute dollar terms) than it was during the 1970s. There is also a greater proportion of the population now that earns more than 2.5X as much as the median - about 11% of households in 2014 - which suggests perceptions of what is ""a lot of money"" will vary more now than it would have in 1970. </p>

<p>In 1970 our top-10% family needed around 7 years to make $100,000, while the median family needed 14 years to make that much. In 2014 the top-10% family needs around 7 years to earn a million, yet the median family needs more than 20 years to earn the same amount.</p>

"Are Forex traders forced to use leverage?","5558","","<p>I heard today that all Forex traders are forced by the Forex companies to use large leverages.</p>

<p>Is this true? I understand this might be good for some companies, but possibly bad for the traders. How come that all Forex companies do this (if true), and no company allows to just trade without leverage?</p>
","<p>While it's not true that you have to use leverage to participate in Forex, the alternative makes it impractical for most people to be able to do so.  You need to be able to put a lot of money into it in order to not trade on leverage.</p>

<p>The fact is, most accounts for ""normal"" people require leverage because the size of the typical contract is more than the average person can afford to risk (or usually more than the average person has).</p>

<p>Leverage, however, in the Forex market is not like Leverage in the stock or commodities market (well, they're the same thing in theory, but they are executed differently).  In Forex, the broker is the one lending you the money in nearly all cases, and they will cash out your position when your account balance is exhausted.  Thus, there is no risk for them (barring fraud or other illegal issues).  Technically, I don't believe they guarantee that you will not accrue a debt, but I've never heard of anyone having their position cashed out and then owed more money.  They've very good about making sure you can only spend money you've deposited.</p>

<p>To put this another way, if you have $1,000 in your account and you are leveraged to 100,000.  Once your trade drops to $1000 in losses your position is automatically cashed out.  There is no risk to the broker, and no risk to you (other than your $1000)... So trading without leverage has little value, while traiding with leverage has lots of potential gain and no downsides (other than a faster rate of loss, but if you're worried about that, just trade smaller lots.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Personal Investment Performance (PIP) — The rate of return earned by your entire account during the 12-month period ending on the date indicated on your annual statement or on your Account Balance page of the TSP website. The PIP is a time-weighted return that has been calculated using a modified-Deitz method (a method used by many financial institutions and an industry standard). The PIP adjusts for the distorting effects of cash flows into or out of your account. It is an estimate; therefore, your PIP may not be the same as the 12-month performance of the TSP funds, which are time-weighted returns.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let's pretend that you had a starting value of $10,000 and an ending value of $20,000. The simple calculation would imply that you doubled your money. But you and the government put in a total of $7,000. To calculate the return do you base it on the 10K or the 17K? The answer is that you need to know when the deposits were made. With deposits every 2 weeks, this become very complex. So don't expect to be able to calculate it without a lot of work.</p>

Does the signing partner take on additional risk by not co-signing with the other partner? Answers listing pros and cons of both situation would be preferred. Thanks.</p>
","<p>I have been through some of this recently. These are the Ontario rules as I know them, and since my searches led to some other provinces' rules, it seems likely they are the same in the rest of Canada with the possible exception of Quebec.</p>

<p>First, if one of the people buying the house actively can't qualify for the mortgage due to bad credit, their name can't be on the deed. If someone else needs to cosign with you to improve the amount you can borrow or the rate you'll be charged, their name needs to be on the deed. These things are not negotiable - the lender doesn't want to lend you $200,000 to only buy half of a $250,000 house. (Your cosigner doesn't need to own an equal share, but they need to be on the deed.)</p>

<p>Second, if you are legally married, and you will live in the house together, it doesn't matter whose name is on the deed, you both own all of the house. Many couples who aren't married may also choose to take on this arrangement. This is the ""as joint tenants and not as tenants in common"" wording you may see on documents. You don't each own half the house the way a brother and sister might, you each own all of it. Neither can sell it without the other's permission, or rent it out, or change the locks. There is simply no impact on any future divorce proceeding of whose name you put on the deed/mortgage, with the possible exception of some extra legal expenses if one person thinks they can do something they can't do and the other person has to get a court order to prove they can't. As long as you both know what you can't do, you're cool. Keep in mind this does not apply to common law couples. For them, whose name(s) is/are on the deed is the only thing that matters (in the absence of a cohabitation agreement.)</p>

<p>Whenever you ""don't need to"" be listed as a borrower, it is very much to your advantage to be so listed. You get the benefit of improving your credit score if the loan is managed properly, and any loan that either one of you can afford alone is certain to be managed properly. So while the unneeded spouse may not be taking any risks by not being included on it (assuming it's a marital home) they are possibly giving up some benefit.</p>

"Should Emergency Funds be Used for Infrequent, but Likely, Expenses?","5545","","<p>Say we break down non-monthly costs into the following three categories.</p>

<ul>
<li>High level of predictability: This would include oil changes that may
be needed every 2 to 4 months depending on usage, car insurance (if
paid every 6 month), car registration, etc.</li>
<li>Medium level of predictability: There are some expense which one can
reasonable assume will occur on an infrequent basis.  For example,
car repairs, house repairs, or even doctor visits during flu season.</li>
<li>Low level of predictability: For example, losing a job, significant
medical expense, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Which of these categories are emergency funds meant to cover?</p>

<p>I think it is pretty clear that a high level of predictability costs should not use emergency funds while a low level of predictability should.  But medium level of predictability costs seem different, and it left me wondering what is generally defined as an ""emergency"".  While you do not know when these costs will occur or how much they will be, you could devise some pretty good rules of thumb on frequency and cost. Say you know your 2007 Volvo should have a repair cost averaging out to $100 per month.  Conceptually you could save $100 each month and when your car breaks, not have to spend any emergency funds on the repair.  Is doing this ""double-saving"" and not suggested if you already have the 6 month emergency fund saved up?</p>

<p>Note: this is a question on how to save money for expenses.  It is not a question about if you should spend emergency fund money to fix a car when you have no other money set aside.</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Which of these categories are emergency funds meant to cover?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Emergency funds are for <em>emergencies</em>, which to me means expenses that are unanticipated and can't be covered out of ""normal"" cash-flow.  Oil changes are not an ""emergency"" and should be part of your normal budget.  Car/house repairs and doctor visits <em>might</em> be an emergency depending on the severity and the urgency (e.g. do I need to fix this <em>now</em> or can I save up and fix it?)</p>

<p>For known, predictable expenses that are infrequent (Christmas, birthdays, car insurance, home insurance/taxes if it's not part of your mortgage payment), I use an <em>escrow account</em>.  I calculate how much I'll need for all of those things put together over the year and set aside a fixed amount each paycheck to ensure that I have enough to cover each item.  You could do something similar for minor doctor visits, car repairs, etc.  Estimate how much you might spend and set aside some money each month. If you find you're spending more than you thought, just increase the amount.  You can use envelopes for each type of expense, have a separate checking account for those, whatever.  The point is to <em>set it aside</em> and make sure you have enough left over to cover your <em>known expenses</em>.</p>

<p>The whole point of an emergency fund is to be able to pay <em>cash</em> for emergencies rather than borrowing to pay them and dealing with interest, late fees, etc.</p>

"What to do when a job offer is made but with a salary less than what was asked for?","5543","","<p>I got a job offer this morning from a place I interviewed at yesterday for a front end developer position in nyc.

I know a lot of people start at a higher number and then come down to the amount they would settle for. Perhaps this is what the HR person assumed and now they are offering me the job for 70k.</p>

<p>I told them on the phone this morning that I really want 75k and she said she will see what she can do, I just called her back and she still says she isn't able to get that approved and that 70k is really the highest for anyone they hire no matter who it is.</p>

<p>It's just frustrating because I assume if they responded to the initial email then it is understood that they are willing to pay me the amount I was asking for. What are your experiences on the matter, did you end up accepting or declined?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>They just called and they accepted the 75k :D. I did learn a lesson though, next time I will ask for more than I want, then ""agree"" to a lower offer.</p>
","<p>In my experience of doing software development for a little longer than I care to remember, salaries are <em>always</em> assumed to be negotiable. I know you said you don't like haggling (a lot of people don't) but you'll have to get used to that and you might have to be a little more flexible. Being able to negotiate something as important as your salary is a very important skill.</p>

<p>That said, there might be several reasons why they're not willing to offer more:</p>

<ul>
<li>A lot of large companies have salary bands based on both experience and role. You might be bumping against the top of the salary band here and it's often impossible to get exemptions in larger corporations.</li>
<li>They might - as rude as this sounds - think that you're asking for too much money given your skills and experience. I'm not saying that this is the case but sitting on the other side of the table I do unfortunately see this with reasonable frequency.</li>
<li>They simply might not have the budget to pay you more than $70k.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's what I would do:</p>

<ul>
<li>First rule of negotiations, BE PREPARED TO WALK.</li>
<li>Figure out what your absolute bottom dollar is that you're willing to accept</li>
<li>If they're not willing to up their cash offer - which I think is not out of the question, they're probably coming in a little lower than they can afford - see if they're willing to throw in some perks/benefits that would counteract the lower salary. Say, they pay you $70k but throw in a $5k annual rail ticket for you to get to work or something like that. Anything that basically would reduce your expenditure or provide something you wouldn't necessarily be able to afford but that's a benefit to you.</li>

"How much of my income should I put towards paying off student loans vs saving for a house?","5507","","<p>New grad here. I finally got all the wonderful mail from the student loan companies informing me I need to start making loan payments. I never realized how much the interest on these things could come out to; 5% seems like such a small number. I also want to save up to buy a condo eventually, but I don't want to lose money on the interest of the student loans. I have a 3 year goal to save up for the down payment of a $500k condo. I have $26k in loans at about 5%. I have an income of $95k not including health care and retirement savings and I'm estimating about $800 in monthly payments. </p>

<p>My question is, how quickly should I be trying to pay off these loans? Should I just forget about saving for a condo until they are paid off?</p>
","<p>In my opinion, you should pay off the student loans as soon as possible, before you start saving for the house downpayment.</p>

<p>$26k is a big number, but you have a great salary.  (Nice!)  Up until now, you have been a poor college student, accustomed to a relatively low standard of living.  Your $800 per month plan would have you pay off the loan in 3 years, but I would challenge you to pay off this entire student loan in 1 year or less.  A monthly loan payment of $2226 will pay off your loan in 12 months.</p>

<p>After that is done, if you take the same amount you had been paying toward your student loans and save it for your condo, in less than two years you'll have a 10% down payment saved ($50k).  The whole thing will take less than three years.</p>

<p>There are three reasons why I recommend paying off the loan first before saving for the condo: one is practical and two are philosophical.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Practical: You will save money on interest.  Paying off the loan in 1 year vs. 3 years will save you $1343.  You won't find a short-term safe investment that will beat 5% in interest.</p></li>
<li><p>Philosophical: The loan is something current and concrete that you can focus on.  Your condo is a dream at this point, and there is lots of time to change your mind.  If the $2k+ per month amount is at all a sacrifice for you, then in a few months, you might be tempted to say to yourself, ""This month I really want a vacation, so I'll just skip this month of saving.""  For the loan, however, if you establish a concrete goal of 12 months to pay off the loan, it will hopefully help motivate you to allocate this money and stick to your plan.</p></li>
<li><p>Philosophical: Getting used to borrowing money, making payments to a bank, and paying interest is not a great way to live.  It is better, in my opinion, to eliminate your debt as fast as possible and start getting accustomed to saving cash for what you want.  Clean up your debt, and resolve not to borrow any more money except for a reasonably-sized mortgage on your home.</p></li>

"How to understand adding or removing ""liquidity"" in stock markets with market/non-market orders?","5505","","<p>Most explanations on this topic <a href=""http://ibkb.interactivebrokers.com/article/201"" rel=""nofollow"">about adding and removing liquidity</a>
simply state that market orders remove liquidity and limit orders add liquidity. Is it possible to have a bit more elaborate explanation as to why this is so?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Marketable orders REMOVE liquidity.<br>
  Non-Marketable orders ADD liquidity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I guess before understanding the above, I need to understand what exactly is liquidity as applied to stock markets?  Does it simply mean stocks which are trading frequently and there is a huge number of buyers and sellers?</p>
","<p>Not all limit orders add liquidity, but all market orders remove liquidity presuming there is liquidity to remove.</p>

<p>A liquidity providing order is one that is posted to the limit book.</p>

<p>If an order, even a limit order, is filled before being posted to the limit book, it removes liquidity.</p>

<p>Liquidity is measured by a balance and abundance of quantities posted on the limit book and the best spread between the lowest ask and the highest bid.</p>

"Mortgage Due Date versus Late Payment Penalty - Can the loan company call me daily?","5504","","<p>My mortgage is due on the 1st.  I was told paying a week after the 1st to match my paychecks wouldn't be a problem.  In fact each and every statement has a date where if I pay after that date, I owe a small penalty but I am not reported on my credit history as late.</p>

<p>The past couple of months I have been getting a phone call from the loan company wanting to know when I would be paying starting on the 2nd of each month.  The first couple of times I informed them that my track record of paying on the 10th or 11th for the past 24 months won't be changing, but they call every day anyway so I quit answering.</p>

<p>I don't want to go nuclear and send a <a href=""http://clarkhoward.com/topics/drop_dead_letter.html"" rel=""nofollow"">drop dead letter</a> (and I am not sure I am legally allowed) but I do want to convince them to quit calling me until I am actually late.</p>

<p><strong>I want to write a letter, but what should I cite as the reason why they need to quit hassling me?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I have never been late, but I have used the late charge</li>
<li>I have been paying on the middle of the month for 24+ months</li>
<li>I have a near perfect credit report</li>
</ul>
","<p>If the collector is the 1st party (the employees doing the collection calling are actually employed by the party who owns the loan), then yes, they can call you daily, as they are not restricted by the FDCPA (Fair Debt Collections Practices Act).  </p>

<p>It is very likely that they are 1st party, because you are paying before you are 30 days delinquent (most 3rd party collection work begins well over 30 days), and it would be very risky for a 3rd party collection agency to call daily.</p>

<p>The foreclosure rate of the past 18 to 24 months have changed the way mortgage servicers conduct ""early"" collections.  Prior to a couple of years ago, not many calls went out before a loan was 16 days delinquent.  Now, they begin collections at day 1 with text-to-voice reminder calls and predictive dialers.  It doesn't cost them much, so I would expect them to continue calling.  Plus, the collector probably loves you, since he/she may get some kind of credit for the payment you eventually make - makes them look good. </p>

<p>I would refrain from sending a letter.  You can continue to pay late, as long as you pay before 30 days late - the options for credit reporting are: current; 30+ days; 60+ days; 90+ days, etc. - so anything less than 30 days delinquent at the end of the month is considered current.  If your letter sounds like some kind of dispute or refusal to pay, they could report your status as some other derogatory status that would hurt your credit.</p>

<p>Depending on the capabilities of their software, you could request to have your payment be paid by ACH on the 10th.  Their predictive dialer software may be configured to eliminate ACH accounts.  Or the collector may have some way of postponing your account to after the ACH draft date - the collector may realize you are setup for ACH, and perhaps they don't get bonused for ACH accounts.</p>

"Buying a new home and having 'equity' in it","5484","","<p>I viewed a model home that was originally priced at about $207,000. The builder is offering it for $173,000 since it was a model. He says that for this reason the home will already have over $30,000 in equity when I purchase it. Is this true, and if so, what does that mean for me? Equity is foreign language in my mind.</p>
","<p>This statement is a come-on, an attempt to impress you with the ""wonderful deal"" you would be getting if you bought the house.  It is not a reality-based statement. </p>

<p>Equity is just a fancy word for how much something you own is worth in cash to you.  If you own a bicycle, you could maybe sell it for say $20, so you have equity of $20 in it.  This is despite the fact that you paid $100 for it long before, and despite it having more utility for you than $20 would, and despite it being emotionally priceless to you; the equity is $20 since that is all the cash you could get for it in the market.</p>

<p>In the case of houses, you have to account for the fact that you (presumably) have borrowed much of the money to buy the house (via a mortgage), and have to pay off the borrowing.  You also have to assess how much you could <em>actually</em> sell the house for.  This selling price is the hard thing to determine, and depends on hard-to-assess factors, such as economic conditions locally and how effective the salesman or broker is.  So for a house that you already own, your equity (estimate) is how much you would be left with after selling it and paying off the borrowings on the house.</p>

<p>In this case, the salesman is trying to imply that the house would be worth $30,000 to you the day you bought it, which is patently absurd.  He is implying it is ""really worth"" $207,000 despite the fact that the builder can't sell it at that price (because he would do so if he could).  If you tried selling it in the months after buying it, you probably could not get more than$173,000 for it (and maybe less), and like most buyers you would start out with an equity, or net worth to you, of slightly less than your down payment.</p>

"3 car garage vs. 2 car garage home ?","5480","","<p>I am choosing between buying a brand new house. I have two options. Both houses are exactly the same, but one has a 3 car garage, and the other one has a two car garage. The 3 car garage house is $285K, and the 2 car garage house is $280K. I'd love to have a 3 car garage, but I'm not sure if the $5K is a fair price difference. My realtor says $5K is a good markup. Is it ? </p>

<p><strong>I googled how much it would cost me to install a garage, and it turns out to be starting at $7K for a 1 car garage. So, will I win $2K at the time of resale ?</strong> </p>
","<p>This question brings back memories. Short answer: get the three car garage! It's the best $5k you'll ever spend.</p>

<p>Long answer: I bought my house many years ago, new construction, and made a choice to get the model with the 2-car garage instead of the one with the 3-car garage across the street because the price difference was $15k. The houses were otherwise identical. My thinking at the time: ""No way I'm spending $15k for a garage spot!""</p>

<p>Oh, the regrets I have today! I envy my neighbors with the extra garage space. Yes, I only have two cars, but storage space is tight, my workbench is impossible to use without backing the car out to the driveway, and I wish I had spent the money. There will be another driver in the house in a few years and I don't have the option of garaging a third car. How I wish I could go back in time and slap some sense into my younger self.</p>

<p>For $5k, I think it's a no-brainer. In 10+ years, my guess is that the houses with the 3-car garage will have appreciated much more than $5k in value than the houses with just 2-car garages. Like I said, I have regrets.</p>

"Can I claim GST/HST Input Tax Credits (ITCs) on Uber, taxi, or limousine fares?","5476","","<p>Uber invoices do not include a GST/HST number, and tax is not separated. On the other hand, Uber drivers ARE required to be registered for GST/HST and collect &amp; remit the tax.</p>

<p>Can I rely on the fact that the driver is required to be registered, and assume that they are in fact including the tax, and therefore claim an input tax credit?</p>

<p>Note: CRA provides instructions for working backwards to calculate GST/HST on a tax-included fare here:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/bsnss/tpcs/gst-tps/txlmsn/menu-eng.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/bsnss/tpcs/gst-tps/txlmsn/menu-eng.html</a></p>
","<p>The Canada Revenue Agency describes in detail <a href=""http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/bsnss/tpcs/gst-tps/bspsbch/itc-cti/nvc-eng.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> what information businesses must generally include on their invoices so that GST/HST registrants can claim Input Tax Credits (ITCs) for the expenses. Quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Sales invoices for GST/HST registrants</strong></p>
  
  <p>You have to give customers who are GST/HST registrants specific
  information on the invoices, receipts, contracts, or other business
  papers that you use when you provide taxable goods and services. This
  information lets them support their claims for input tax credits
  (ITCs) or rebates for the GST/HST you charged. [...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The page quoted continues with a table describing what, specifically, needs to be on a sales invoice based on the total amount of the invoice; the requirements differ for: total sale under $30, total sale between $30 to $149.99, and total sale $150 or more.</p>

<p>For the total sale under $30 category, the only things a sales invoice <em>must</em> contain to support an ITC claim are (1) the provider's business name, (2) the invoice date, and (3) the total amount paid/payable. i.e. When the total sale is under $30, there is no requirement for any GST/HST amount to be indicated separately, nor for a business number to be present on the invoice.</p>

<p>Hence, IMHO (and I am neither an accountant nor a lawyer), if your Uber rides are for $30 or less, then you shouldn't expect a GST/HST number anyway, and a simple invoice as described should be enough for you to claim your ITCs. Whether or not the provider is registered in fact for GST/HST is beside the point.</p>

<p>For amounts over $30, you need a bit more. While the page above specifies that the provider's business number should be included beginning with the next level of total sales,  there are exceptions to those rules described at another page mentioned, <a href=""http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/bsnss/tpcs/gst-tps/bspsbch/itc-cti/xcptnstnvc-eng.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Exceptions to invoice requirements</a>, that specifically apply to the taxi/limousine case. Quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Exceptions to invoice requirements</strong></p>
  
  <p>GST/HST registrants are required to keep the necessary documentation
  to support their claim for ITCs and rebates. In certain circumstances
  the documentation requirements have been reduced.</p>
  
  <p>[...]</p>
  
  <p><strong>For taxi or limousine fares your books and records must show:</strong></p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>the supplier's name or trade name;</li>
  <li>the date of the supply;</li>
  <li>the fare; and</li>
  <li><em>the amount of GST/HST charged, or a statement that the fare includes GST/HST.</em>  [emphasis mine]</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>So at a minimum, for fare in excess of $30 total, you should ask the driver to note <em>either</em> (a) the amount of GST/HST charged, or (b) a statement that the fare includes GST/HST. The driver's business number need not be specified. Consequently, if your receipt for a ride in excess of $30 does not contain any such additional information with respect to GST/HST, then I would expect the receipt does not satisfy the CRA's requirements for supporting your ITC claim.</p>

<p>i.e. Keep your individual rides under $30 each, or else get a better receipt from the driver when it is above that amount.</p>

<p>p.s. It should go without saying, but your rides, of course, must be considered reasonable business expenses in order to qualify for GST/HST ITCs for your business. Receipts for rides of a personal nature are not eligible, so be sure to maintain proper records as to the business purpose and destination for each ride receipt so claimed.</p>

"Moving money from my savings account to an IRA - why am I paying taxes on it?","5475","","<p>I'm planning to move money from my savings account to a new IRA account, but I don't understand why I'll be charged penalties for withdrawing the money. </p>

<p>Why do I have to pay extra taxes to take my money out of a retirement account as a opposed to my savings account?</p>

<p>Why shouldn't I just keep my money in the savings account and earn the same amount (both accounts have the same APY in this case)?</p>
","<blockquote>
  <p>Why shouldn't I just keep my money in the savings account and earn the same amount (both accounts have the same APY in this case)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I will assume that you are transferring money from your savings account into
a Traditional IRA and deducting the contribution from your income.  While
you may think that the money that is being transferred is yours already --
it is sitting in your savings account, for Pete's sake! -- you are deducting
that amount in getting to your taxable income, and so you are effectively
contributing it from current income and <strong>not paying taxes on the amount
contributed.</strong></p>

<p>So, consider the same amount of money sitting in your savings account
versus the same amount of money sitting in your Traditional IRA account.
While you will earn the same amount of interest in both accounts, you <em>will</em> have 
to pay <strong>taxes</strong> each year on the interest earned in the savings account. You might 
choose, <em>as most people do,</em> to not take money out of the savings account to pay theses
taxes but just pay them from ready cash/checking account/current income etc., or these
taxes might just reduce the refund that you will getting from the IRS and your
State income tax authority, but in either case, you <em>have</em> paid taxes on the interest
earned in your non-IRA savings account, and of course, long ago, you also
paid taxes on the original amount in the non-IRA savings account.  So, if you
take any money out of the non-IRA savings account, you don't pay any taxes
on the amount withdrawn except possibly for the interest earned from January 1
till the date of withdrawal (which you are paying from ready cash).
On the other hand, consider the Traditional IRA. The original deposit was not
taxed in the sense that you got a deduction (reduced tax or increased refund)
when you made the contribution. The annual interest earned was not taxed each
year either.  So when you make a <em>qualified</em> withdrawal (after age 59.5 or
by meeting one of the other exceptions allowing withdrawal before age 59.5),
you are taking money on which you have not paid any taxes at all, and the
IRS wants its cut.  The money withdrawn is taxable income to you.
Furthermore, the money withdrawn is not
eligible for any kind of favorable treatment such as having it count as
qualified dividends or as long-term capital gains even if your IRA
was invested in stocks and the money in the account is all qualified
dividends or long-term capital gains.  If you make an unqualified
withdrawal, you owe a <em>penalty</em> (technically named an <em>excise</em> tax)
in addition to income tax on the amount withdrawn.</p>

<p>If you are investing in a <em>Roth</em> IRA, you will not be getting a deduction
when you make the contribution, and qualified withdrawals are 
completely tax-free, and so the answer is completely different
from the above.</p>

","<p>As said in the comment, check with the international students office in your school about getting CINTAX/GLACIER access. Most (the larger) schools provide this service for free.</p>

<p>Whether through GLACIER, or in some other way, what you need to do is to file a <em>tax return</em> - form 1040NR to the IRS, and similar form to your State (in California - FTB form 540).</p>

<p>Note that you'll need to check a possibility of treaty benefits (if your country has a tax treaty with the US, you're likely allowed to exclude at least some portion of your income and not pay tax on it).</p>

<p>Usually GLACIER software (developed specifically for international students and visiting scholars) takes care of all these things and provides you with the forms you then need to mail to the IRS and the State. If your school doesn't provide access to GLACIER - you can try the <a href=""http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/Free-Tax-Return-Preparation-for-You-by-Volunteers"">IRS free assistance program</a>. If that is not an option, then you probably should ask a professional help you with this, but ask for references from other international students who've been here for a while already, because most US tax preparers know absolutely <strong>nothing</strong> when it comes to international taxation issues.</p>

<p>If your country doesn't have a tax treaty, or your school provides you with tax treaty exclusion (i.e.: the income shown in W2 is less than what you were actually paid because you're a foreigner and signed some paper with HR), then you can fill the forms yourself, it would be pretty straight forward. You'll need to check with the payroll department about form 1042-S for that.</p>

<p>But pay attention to these points:</p>

<ol>
<li>Assuming its your first year in the US (in fact - first 5 years, as long as you keep your F1 status and don't apply for green card), and you're not a US citizen or permanent resident (which is safe to assume since you mentioned you're F1 student), you <strong>should not</strong> file form 1040/1040A/1040EZ, you should file either 1040NR or 1040NR-EZ. The ""NR"" is important: you're <strong>non</strong>-resident, the taxation is different. You should also remember to fill form 8843 with your tax return (part III).</li>
<li>The fact that you're non-resident for Federal taxes (IRS) has no bearing on your State tax liability, so pay attention as there are differences. Depending on the State, you may be considered a resident for tax purposes from when you came, and will need to file a dual status return. Also, some states don't recognize treaty benefits. California is an example for a State where both the issues would come up.</li>
<li>You <strong>should not</strong> use the tax preparation software sold in stores (Turbo Tax, H&amp;R Block At Home, etc), as it will not provide the right forms for you. Standard retail software doesn't support your situation, and is useless for you. Similarly, retail chain tax preparers (like H&amp;R Block, Liberty, etc) will probably not know how to handle it unless they're specifically targeting international students and have proper training and expertise. Most likely they don't.</li>
</ol>

<p>When you have your return done, the ""leaves"" of W2 get sent with it to the tax authorities - one copy to the IRS, another to the State.</p>

<p>You can start familiarizing yourself with <a href=""http://www.irs.gov/publications/p519/index.html"">IRS publication 519 - U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens</a>, if you want to be able to prepare or understand your tax returns yourself.</p>

"Why are there many small banks and more banks in the U.S.?","5461","","<p>I'm a Canadian and here in Canada, we don't have a ton of banks. We have around 5 or 6 major banks (Scotiabank, Royal Bank of Canada, CIBC, etc.) and basically no others (except a couple of credit unions). The branches of these banks are also pretty far apart.</p>

<p>I have travelled to the U.S. and what I see there is very different. Looking out the window driving up a main drag in a random Floridan town I counted four Bank of Americas in 7-8 minutes.</p>

<p>Also, there are more small banks. I travelled to Maine and there are these tiny banks such as ""Bar Harbour Bank and Trust"" or ""Bangor Savings Bank"" or ""Machias Savings Bank"". There are many branches of these banks. It just puzzles me how there are literally as many banks in Maine as there are in all of Canada.</p>

<p>I hypothesised that these little banks are owned by a bigger bank and are just local things to make them feel more local. But I have really no idea.</p>
","<p>As an addendum to PeterK's answer, once upon a time, there were many <em>Savings and Loan Associations</em> (S&amp;Ls) that acted as small banks, accepting savings deposits from people and lending money for home mortgages to local residents. Some of these S&amp;Ls were chartered Federally with deposits insured by the FSLIC (similar to the FDIC which still insures deposits in banks) while others had State charters and used the State equivalent of FSLIC as the insurer. To induce people to save with S&amp;Ls instead of banks, S&amp;Ls paid higher rates of interest on their savings accounts than banks were permitted to do on bank savings accounts. Until 1980, S&amp;Ls were not permitted to make consumer or commercial loans, have checking accounts, issue credit cards, etc., but once the US Congress in its wisdom permitted this practice, this part of the business boomed. (Note for @RonJohn: Prior to 1980, S&amp;Ls offered <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negotiable_Order_of_Withdrawal_account"" rel=""noreferrer"">NOW accounts</a> on which ""checks"" (technically, <em>Negotiated Orders of Withdrawal</em>) could be written but they were not checks in the legal sense, and many S&amp;Ls did not return these paid ""checks"" with the monthly statement as all banks did; writing a ""check"" while pressing hard created a carbon copy that could be used as proof of payment). In just a few years' time, many S&amp;Ls crashed because they were not geared to handle the complexities of the new things that they were permitted to do, and so ran into trouble with bad loans as well as outright fraud by S&amp;L management and boards of directors etc.</p>

<p>After the disappearance of most S&amp;Ls, many small banks (often with State charters only) sprang up, and that's why there are so many banks in the US. Mortgage lending is a lucrative business (if done right), and everyone wants to get into the business. Note that 4 branches of Bank of America in a Florida town is not a sign of many banks; the many <em>different</em> banks that the OP noticed in Maine is.</p>

However, I've also heard you need to hold the stock for a year to avoid some sort of capital gains tax, and exercising early gets the clock ticking earlier. What is the math here? How can I tell if it's worth it?</p>
","<p>Despite a fair number of views, no one besides @mbhunter answered, so I'll gather the findings of my own research here. Hopefully, this will help others in similar situations. If you spot any errors, please let me know!</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Exercising your options and taxes</strong>: If the strike price for your stock is S and the current fair market value is F, then the difference (F - S) is subject to taxes, even if you don't actually sell the stock and realize that profit.</li>
<li><strong>Non-qualified stock options</strong>: are subject to income taxes, which roughly means you take the ""profit"" from (1) and add it to your income, as if it was part of your salary. This means it gets taxed at whatever tax bracket your salary + profit end up in, usually in the 10-35% range.</li>
<li><strong>ISO stock options</strong>: are not subject to income taxes, but they <em>do</em> get counted when calculating AMT. Although most people aren't typically subject to AMT, if you make enough profit from (1), you may be. Not sure what the rate is for AMT, but seems to be around 25%.</li>
<li><strong>AMT calculation</strong>: fill out form 6251 or use software such as TurboTax (it takes just a couple minutes using the latter).</li>
<li><strong>Selling your options</strong>: if you sell your options at price P, the difference between (P - F) also has tax implications. If (P - F) is negative - that is, you lost money - you can write it off. I believe the maximum write off is $3k per year. If (P-F) is positive - that is, you made a profit - it gets taxed.</li>
<li><strong>Short term capital gains tax</strong>: if you sell your options less than one year after exercising, the profit is subject to short term capital gains tax. Similar to (2), this roughly means the profit is tacked onto your income as if it was part of your salary and depending on what bracket you end up in, gets taxed at 10-35%.</li>
<li><strong>Long term capital gains tax</strong>: if you sell your options more than one year after exercising (and two years after the options were granted), the profits are subject to long term capital gains tax, which is typically 15%.</li>
<li><strong>Exercising options early</strong>: some companies allow you to exercise all your options early - that is, before they actually vest (though you still won't be able to actually sell them until they vest).  </li>
<li><strong>Advantages of exercising options early</strong>: as soon as you exercise, the ""clock starts ticking"" for when you get into long term capital gains territory and consequently, pay far less taxes when you sell your options. Moreover, if the fair market value is increasing, exercising sooner minimizes (F - S) and consequently, minimizes the ""profit"" that gets taxed at the relatively high rates of income/AMT taxes as described in (1) and (2). Exercising when F == S and waiting at least one year to sell your options keeps taxes to an absolute minimum.</li>
<li><strong>Disadvantages of exercising options early</strong>: to exercise your options, you must pay (S * N) + (F - S)(N)(income tax or AMT rate) where S = strike price, F = fair market value, N = number of shares. This may be a lot of money up front, especially given that you might not actually be able to sell these options for a long time.
Moreover, by the time you can sell, it's possible that the stock tanks - or perhaps the company doesn't go public in the first place - at which point you're out a lot of money.</li>

"Can a friend put up collateral for my secured loan?","5452","","<p>I'm the friend. My mom needs a loan from me and figures involving a bank might avoid some headaches.
She wants me to lend her 20K. Wire it to the bank. Then the bank will (presumably) lend her 20K.
Do banks do this?</p>
","<p>Short answer: yes, you can put up collateral for someone else's loan. The bank will be happy to take your money, give it to the other person, and return it to you on completion of the loan (keeping the interest the security makes on the money market <em>and</em> the interest they're charging the other person for themselves).</p>

<p>If the above doesn't sound very appealing (you don't see any benefit from your investment, and can be left holding the bag if your friend defaults on their loan), it really isn't a great way to spend your money. However, as assistance to someone else, it provides several advantages over directly transferring the money:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The lendee gets a better rate than they normally would from the bank</strong> - Basically, from the bank's perspective, the loan's covered, so there's very little risk of a default leaving them holding the bag. As such, they can typically offer rock-bottom, cost-of-capital rates.</li>
<li><strong>The lendee builds credit history</strong> - Since the lendee is making payments on a legitimate, structured loan to an entity that reports to the credit agencies, this is a very good way to help the lendee build good credit.</li>
<li><strong>You avoid the gift tax</strong> - If you lend over $13k, unless there's a contract between the two of you stipulating a schedule of payments, it's a ""gift"" as far as the IRS is concerned and you will be taxed on the amount above the exemption.   EDIT: The $13k figure (going up to $14k for 2013) is only the limit if the loan is not a loan, but in fact treated as a gift (i.e. no reasonable prospect of repayment).  For bona fide loans, there is no fixed upper limit on the amount you can loan, but the gift tax will be determined based on the difference between the interest charged and the ""applicable federal rate"" (this rule is found in IRC Sec. 7872; check IRS.gov for monthly Rev. Proc.'s listing newest AFR's).  Last time I checked the short-term and medium-term rates were around 0.2%, so if this still holds it's an excellent time right now to ""gift"" your credit at little to no gift tax cost.  One can even take advantage of this by making so-called ""back-to-back"" loans- taking out a HELOC at 4% and subsequently loaning proceeds to your child at .2% (or whatever the current AFR), producing no taxable gift on the 3.8% difference.</li>
<li><strong>The lendee may be able to deduct interest</strong> - depending on the type of loan (maybe the $20k is the 15% of an 80-15-5 mortgage), the interest paid on that loan can be tax-deductible. A personal loan between friends? No way.</li>

"How much does credit score matter?","5450","","<p>The higher your credit score, the better. If you ever had the choice of two different credit scores, you are always better off preferring the higher one.</p>

<p>However, while the utility of a higher score is always positive, it is not always large. Sometimes it may even be minuscule. Since having a higher score takes effort (and possibly money) it's not uncommon to end up in a situation where increasing your credit score isn't worth it, since the benefits are too little.</p>

<p>For example, <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/a/59178/7131"">in this answer</a> it is claimed that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>there is no difference between a 750 score and an 850 score; you are already eligible for the best loan rates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was curious: What are the major breakpoints of credit scores where it does matter? Are there major score thresholds, that once you pass them, you suddenly experience tremendous noticeable benefits (like suddenly qualifying for a whole class of better credit)? Are there ranges of score (like the 750-850 asserted above) where, it doesn't really matter which part of the range you are in, you still enjoy the same benefits financially?</p>
","<p>There are lots of opinions on the meaning of different credit scores.  Each lender can ultimately choose whatever cutoff they want for their products.</p>

<p>Creditscoring.com has a fascinating page that they call <a href=""http://www.creditscoring.com/pages/bar.htm"">The Bar</a>.  It is a series of quotes from different credit reporting agencies, news outlets, and lenders about what different scores mean.  The quotes are sorted by score, and it is interesting to see the different opinions about what is considered an <em>excellent</em> score, what is considered <em>average</em>, and what is a <em>poor</em> score.</p>

<p>Looking at the list, you can find quotes on the bottom cutoff for <em>excellent</em> scores anywhere from 760 down to 620.  Similarly, the opinion on the top cutoff for a <em>poor</em> score ranges from 650 all the way down to 580.  There is no consensus.</p>

<p>I know when I was looking for a new credit card a year ago, most credit card sites had you select a range of credit card scores so that you would know which cards you might be eligible for.  I think when I looked at CapitalOne's website last year, they described excellent credit as a score of 720+, eligible for every one of the credit cards they offer.  Looking at their website now, they don't even list ranges of scores anymore.  They simply describe excellent credit as this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""I have never declared bankruptcy or defaulted on a loan. I have not been more than 60 days late on any credit card, medical bill, or loan in the last year.
  - AND -
  I have had a loan or credit card for 3 years or more with a credit limit above $5,000.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I wrote the ""no difference between 750 and 850"" answer, I had this 720+ score in mind.  Once you get in that range, you aren't going to be turned down for any loan because of your score.  (You might get turned down for something because of a lack of income, but that is different.)  Remember, financial institutions do not want to reject people for loans.  Loans are how they make money.  If they had a loan product that required a score of 820, there would not be a large market of people eligible for it.</p>

I have no debt at all and aside from a few deferred expenses, no immediate needs.

I went to my bank to open a savings account but the person there suggested I get a short term (3 month) CD since the interest rate for it is 1.0% compared to .02% for the savings account.

"Optimal way for withdrawing vested company match from my 401k?","5430","","<p>It's possible that I'll be laid off in a few months.</p>

<p>Currently I have <code>x + y</code> in my 401k.</p>

<pre><code>x = my personal contribution
y = my company match --&gt; which is vested
</code></pre>

<p>Soon I'll make a fairly big personal, but important purchase. When I leave my job, I plan to withdraw my company's match. Plus I'm young, and have future earnings potential.</p>

<p>My logic is that I'd like to have the spare cash, plus I'll have my degree from an Ivy league school with solid work experience in software engineering.</p>

<p>Is there an ideal way to withdraw the company match 401k, or must I simply accept the 30% hit?</p>
","<p>Why would you want to withdraw only the company match, and presumably leave your personal contributions sitting in your ex-company's 401k plan? <strong>Generally,</strong> 401k plans have larger annual expenses and provide for poorer investment choices than are available to you if you
<em>roll over</em> your 401k investments into an IRA. So, unless you have <em>specific</em> reasons
for wanting to continue to leave your money in the 401k plan (e.g. you have access to
investments that are <em>not</em> available to nonparticipants and you think those investments
are where you want your money to be), roll over part (or all) of your 401k assets into
an IRA, and withdraw the rest for personal expenses.  If your personal contributions
are in a Roth 401k, roll them over to a Roth IRA, but, as I remember it,
company contributions are not part of the Roth 401k and must be rolled over into
a Traditional IRA. Perhaps this is why you want to take those in cash to pay for
your personal purchase?</p>

<p>Also, what is this 30% hit you are talking about? You will owe income tax on
the money withdrawn from the 401k (and custodians traditionally withhold 20%
and send it to the IRS on your behalf) plus penalty for early withdrawal
(which the custodian may also withhold if you ask them), but the tax
that you will pay on the money withdrawn will depend on your tax bracket,
which may be lower if you are laid off and do not immediately take on a
new job. That is, the 30% hit may be on the cash flow, but you may get
some of it back as a refund when you file your income tax return.</p>

"Credit cards: How is a cash advance different from a purchase? Why are the fees so high?","5419","","<p>I have a couple of questions about the notion of ""cash advance"" on credit cards. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>How does the credit company decide if some transaction is a ""cash advance""? Does the merchant tell the credit company it's ""cash"" or does it depend on the type of the merchant (e.g. anything I buy from certain merchant is considered ""cash"")? For example, if I buy a foreign currency from some merchant, would it be ""cash"" (even though I can't use that currency to buy stuff until I go to a country where it is valid)? What if it's a collector's item (but also a circulating currency in some country)? i.e., who decides that and by which rules?</p></li>
<li><p>Why do credit companies charge high fees on ""cash advances""? i.e., why do they care how I used the balance &ndash; if I directly exchanged it for an item or took cash and then bought an item? I understand it may be the loss of the transaction fees in the second case but the fees they charge and the interest they charge are much higher than any transaction fees. Is it just the case of charging extraordinary fees to discourage certain behavior? </p></li>
</ol>
","<ol>
<li>It has more to do with who is paying the credit processors for the service, than what the goods really are.</li>
</ol>

<p>Essentially speaking, when you purchase goods worth $100 using your card, the store has to pay about $2 for the transaction to the company that operates that stores' credit card terminal. </p>

<p>If you withdraw cash from an ATM, you might be charged a fee for such a transaction. However, the ATM operator doesn't pay the credit processor such a transaction fee - thus, it is classified as a cash transaction. </p>

<ol>
<li>It's an attempt to discourage certain behavior. It is also used (at least deciding to accrue interest immediately) to prevent users from paying back one CC using a cash advance from another - this way one could run on grace periods indefinitely. </li>
</ol>

<p>Additionally, performing cash advances off a CC is a rather good indicator of a bad financial health of the user, which increase the risk of default, and in some institutions is a factor contributing to their internal creditworthiness assessment. </p>

"Advantages of paying more of your mortgage while you know you won't continue to live there your whole life","5404","","<p>Recently I bought a house for 140k in the Netherlands. It had a mortgage of 110k (3,0% interest) and a startersloan of 30k (4,0% interest, no payments/interest the first 3 years). </p>

<p>I am getting married this year and once that's done, I will have about 300 euros each month to put to my mortgage or startersloan. There will be no penalties if i pay it earlier. </p>

<p>Problem I am having is that I will live in this house for about 10 years and I will never pay off the mortgage before selling it.</p>

<p>I can imagine there are advantages of paying more to your mortgage even though you are not planning to live in that house for 30 years. What are those advantages? Are there more smart choices to make except for paying other loans of first?</p>
","<p>In the Netherlands specifically, there are several reasons to pay extra off on your mortgage.</p>

<p>First, house prices have dropped significantly in the last several years.  They are rising slowly now, but it's region specific and you can still borrow more than 100% of the price of the house.  Under these conditions, if you choose to sell your house and the outstanding mortgage amount is greater than the value of your house, you are left with a gap (restschuld) to finance.  I think the rules have changed recently around this, allowing you to finance this gap with a new mortgage, but this is not a good idea.  The tax implications of this are likely to be complicated in the long run and your new house may not cover this gap for some time.</p>

<p>Second, the less you owe on your house, the lower mortgage rates you can get.  Mortgages in the Netherlands usually fall into categories based on percentage of the auction price at a foreclosure sale (executiewaarde).  If you pay more of your mortgage off, you may qualify for a lower interest rate, possibly making refinancing interesting.  This is especially important if interest rates continue to drop but the value of your house does not increase or even decreases.</p>

<p>Third, if you choose to keep your house and rent it out, the banks in the Netherlands have very strict rules on this if you want to do it above board.  I've read that some banks require the mortgage amount (NB not the value you may have built up in a linked savings or insurance account) to be less than 50% of the foreclosure auction price (executiewaarde).  Also, related to point 2, if you have something other than a linear or annuity mortgage, you will need to refinance to do this as the tax advantages around savings mortgages ([bank]spaarhypotheken) do not apply if it is not used as your own residence.</p>

<p>Finally, if you choose to sell and you are in the happy position of having the value of your house be greater than the value of your mortgage (you have an overwaarde), there may still be some obstacles.  Any value you have accumulated in a linked savings or life insurance account is not available until <strong>after</strong> you sell your house.  Extra value derived purely from the difference between mortgage value and sale price may be easier to deal with.</p>

<p>EDIT: As a final note, I've made extra payments on both a ""Spaarhypotheek"" (linked life insurance) and a ""Bankspaarhypotheek"" (linked savings account).  In one, the principal paid each month reduced and the mortgage lifetime stayed the same.  In the other, the principal paid each month stayed the same and the lifetime reduced.  In both cases, interest payments were less each month.  I would contact your mortgage provider to understand what the expected impact of extra payments will be.</p>

Who has the power to do that and why would anyone buy or sell like that?</p>
","<p><strong>If you do not understand the volatility of the fx market, you need to stop trading it, immediately</strong>. There are many reasons that fx is riskier than other types of investing, and you bear those risks whether you understand them or not. Below are a number of reasons why fx trading has high levels of risk:</p>

<p>1) <strong>FX trades on the <em>relative</em> exchange rate between currencies</strong>. That means it is a zero-sum game. Over time, the global fx market cannot 'grow'. If the US economy doubles in size, and the European economy doubles in size, then the exchange rate between the USD and the EUR will be the same as it is today (in an extreme example, all else being equal, yes I know that value of currency /= value of total economy, but the general point stands). </p>

<p>Compare that with the stock market - if the US economy doubles in size, then effectively the value of your stock investments will double in size. That means that stocks, bonds, etc. tied to real world economies generally increase when the global economy increases - it is a positive sum game, where many players can be winners. On the long term, on average, most people earn value, without needing to get into 'timing' of trades. This allows many people to consider long-term equity investing to be lower risk than 'day-trading'. With FX, because the value of a currency is in its <em>relative</em> position compared with another currency, 1 player is a winner, 1 player is a loser. By this token, most fx trading is necessarily short-term 'day-trading', which by itself carries inherent risk.</p>

<p>2) <strong>Fx markets are insanely efficient</strong> (I will lightly state that this is my opinion, but one that I am not alone in holding firmly). This means that public information about a currency [ie: economic news, political news, etc.] is nearly immediately acted upon by many, many people, so that the revised fx price of that currency will quickly adjust. The more efficient a market is, the harder it is to 'time a trade'. As an example, if you see on a news feed that the head of a central bank authority made an announcement about interest rates in that country [a common driver of fx prices], you have only moments to make a trade before the large institutional investors already factor it into their bid/ask prices. Keep in mind that the large fx players are dealing with millions and billions of dollars; markets can move very quickly because of this.</p>

<p>Note that some currencies trade more frequently than others. The main currency 'pairs' are typically between USD and / or other G10 country-currencies [JPY, EUR, etc.]. As you get into currencies of smaller countries, trading of those currencies happens less frequently. This means that there may be some additional time before public information is 'priced in' to the market value of that currency, making that currency 'less efficient'. On the flip side, if something is infrequently traded, pricing can be more volatile, as a few relatively smaller trades can have a big impact on the market. </p>

<p>3) <strong>Uncertainty of political news</strong>. If you make an fx trade based on what you believe will happen after an expected political event, you are taking risk that the event actually happens. Politics and world events can be very hard to predict, and there is a high element of chance involved [see recent 'expected' election results across the world for evidence of this]. For something like the stock market, a particular industry may get hit every once in a while with unexpected news, but the fx market is inherently tied to politics in a way that may impact exchange rates multiple times a day.</p>

<p>4) <strong>Leveraging</strong>. It is very common for fx traders to borrow money to invest in fx. This creates additional risk because it amplifies the impact of your (positive or negative) returns. This applies to other investments as well, but I mention it because high degrees of debt leveraging is extremely common in FX.</p>

<p><strong>To answer your direct question:</strong> There are no single individual traders who spike fx prices - that is the impact you see of a very efficient market, with large value traders, reacting to frequent, surprising news. </p>

<p><strong>I reiterate: If you do not understand the risks associated with fx trade, I recommend that you stop this activity immediately, at least until you understand it better</strong> [and I would recommend personally that any amateur investor never get involved in fx at all, regardless of how informed you believe you are].</p>

I'm just a few chapters shy of being able to write a book about the <a href=""https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/63560/using-a-non-fee-only-financial-planner/63561#63561"">incorrect advice</a> I'd heard bank people give their customers. The second bit of advice is that you don't need to pay interest to have credit cards show good payment history. i.e. if you choose to use credit cards, use them for the convenience, cash/rebates, tracking, and guarantees they can offer. Pay in full each bill. </p>

<p>Last - use a free service, first, <a href=""https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">AnnualCreditReport.com</a> to get a copy of your credit report, and then a service like <a href=""http://www.CreditKarma.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Credit Karma</a> for a simulated FICO score and advice on how to improve it. As member @Agop has commented, <a href=""https://www.creditscorecard.com/registration"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Discover</a> (not just for cardholders) offers a look at your actual score, as do a number of other credit cards for members. </p>

"Can you pay off lease early?","5391","","<p>If I pay off lease amount early for a car, is there any impact on my credit?</p>

<p>Let's say I'm paying $400/month for 36 months, which is 14,400 total. If I pay 14,400 within 6 months, are there any disadvantages on my credit?</p>
","<p>In general the answer is yes, you can pay it off early. However, check the terms of your lease for a ""prepayment penalty."" They are becoming less common, but if you have such terms in your lease, you might incur a fee for paying early. Even then, if the prepayment penalty is less than the interest you would otherwise pay, it would still be worth it.</p>

<p>Paying off loans is a positive thing for your credit. It won't negatively impact your credit to prepay.</p>

"Why is OkPay not allowed in the United States?","5386","","<p>For those of us who deal with freelance foreign clients, <a href=""https://www.okpay.com/en/"">I've heard of this company</a> from clients, but can't figure out why it's not allowed in the United States.  The reason I ask is that they advertise that they are in 200 countries - yet aren't in the largest economy in the world?  That makes very little sense.</p>

<p>Just as a comparison, when I tried to sign up in the US, it gave me a warning that it wasn't available, yet when I choose China or Venezuela - <em>communist countries</em> - it's fine.</p>
","<p>The U.S. requires money transfer services to be licensed under 31 USC 5330 in addition to any applicable laws at the state level.  According to multiple sources online, including the thread referenced by MD-Tech's answer, OkPay either cannot or will not get a license, so they are out.</p>

<p>I dug on this a bit more because I thought it was interesting, and OkPay has other issues with U.S. and other regulators related to its interaction with Bitcoins, which themselves are a hot potato for regulation right now and may explain the licensing problem.  It seems to also be facing regulatory pressure in other countries, by the way, so it's not strictly a problem they face in the U.S.  Just for whatever reason, the problem is greater here.  Some interesting summary points:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With mounting pressure on online money exchanges from US regulators, payments processor OKPay has announced that it is suspending processing for all Bitcoin exchanges, including industry leader Mt. Gox.</p>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p>Earlier this month, the US Department of Homeland Security seized Mt. Gox's account with mobile payment processor Dwolla, on allegations that the account was in violation of US Code 18 USC § 1960 by operating an ""unlicensed money transmitting business.""</p>
  
  <p>Just where the Bitcoin market falls under US law is unclear, because the legality of Bitcoin transactions has yet to be tried in court and law enforcement has refused to comment on ongoing investigations, such as the Dwolla case.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The UK bank that we used before did not make a final decision on whether to handle transactions in favour of crypto-currencies or not. Therefore the compliance department of the bank asked us to restrict such transfers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This apparently allowed them to reverse a policy in the UK:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>OKPAY's policy shift comes just months after it stipulated that GBP users check a box, verifying that their funds would not be spent on cryptocurrency, a feature that further incited users.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>OKPAY are quite paranoid about AML and another problem is that their support people seem to be very bad at English, so their replies are often hard to understand. Their support are also slow [sic]. However in my experience they are an honest company.</p>

<p>I found at least one case where rumors that the entire company were going to shut down were traced back to a poorly translated message issued by the company.</p>

"How to pay bills for one month while waiting for new job?","5368","","<p>I recently, and unexpectedly, lost my job.  Because I had summers off (no paychecks either), I've been using my credit cards for most purchases, saving what cash I had saved from the previous year to pay bills (rent/car/etc.).</p>

<p>I am in the middle of interviewing for several positions, and expect to have a job within 30 days. My question is: what to do until then?</p>

<p>My monthly expenses (including credit card minimum payments) are about $3500.  Seeing as my credit cards don't have that much room on them, and my bank account is painfully empty, I am left with what feels like the following two options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Take out a new credit card.</li>
<li>Ask the bank for a loan.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now I have no idea how loans work, and am not even sure I could take out a loan so small. But that certainly seems preferable to opening my third credit card, and the high interest rates that entails.  So I have several related questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are these my only two options?</li>
<li>What is my best course of action, trying to minimize future debt?</li>
<li>Assuming I receive this $3500, am I better off using the bulk to pay off my credit cards, or should I keep as much cash available as I can?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Just a few details I thought might be pertinent:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>My credit is very good.  I've never missed a payment on my credit card or any bills. The last time I checked (roughly 18 months ago), my credit score was a 710 out of 790.</p></li>
<li><p>The $3500 in expenses covers both items I can use credit or cash for (e.g., groceries), and items I can only use cash for (rent).  The split between ""cash only"" and ""either"" is approximately 50/50.</p></li>
</ul>
","<p>A traditional bank is not likely to give you a loan if you have no source of income. Credit card application forms also ask for your current income level and may reject you based on not having a job.</p>

<p>You might want to make a list of income and expenses and look closely at which expenses can be reduced or eliminated. Use 6 months of your actual bills to calculate this list. Also make a list of your assets and liabilities. A sheet that lists income/expenses and assets/liabilities is called a Financial Statement. This is the most basic tool you'll need to get your expenses under control.</p>

<p>There are many other options for raising capital to pay for your monthly expenses:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Sell off your possessions that you no longer need or can't afford</p></li>
<li><p>Ask for short term loan help from family and friends </p></li>
<li><p>Advertise for short term loan help on websites such as Kijiji</p></li>
<li><p>Start a part-time business doing something that you like and people need. Tutoring, dog-walking, photography, you make the list and pick from it.</p></li>
<li><p>Look into unemployment insurance. Apply as soon as you are out of work. The folks at the unemployment office are willing to answer all your questions and help you get what you need.</p></li>
<li><p>Dip into your retirement fund.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>To reduce your expenses, here are a few things you may not have considered:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you own your home, make an appointment with your bank to discuss renegotiation of your mortgage payments. The bank will be more interested in helping you before you start missing payments than after. Depending on how much equity you have in your home, you may be able to significantly reduce payments by extending the life of the mortgage. Your banker will be impressed if you can bring them a balance sheet that shows your assets, liabilities, income and expenses.  </p></li>
<li><p>As above, for car payments as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Call your phone, cable, credit card, and internet service providers and tell them you want to cancel your service. This will immediately connect you to Customer Retention. Let them know that you are having a hard time paying your bill and will either have to negotiate a lower payment or cancel the service. This tactic can significantly reduce your payments.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>When you have your new job, there are some things you can do to make sure this doesn't happen again:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Set aside 10% of your income in a savings account. Have it automatically deducted from your income at source if you can. 75% of Americans are 4 weeks away from bankruptcy. You can avoid this by forcing yourself to save enough to manage your household finances for 3 - 6 months, a year is better.</p></li>
<li><p>If you own your own home, take out a line of credit against it based on the available equity. Your bank can help you with that. It won't cost you anything as long as you don't use it. This is emergency money; do not use it for vacations or car repairs. There will always be little emergencies in life, this line of credit is not for that. </p></li>
<li><p>Pay off your credit cards and loans, most expensive rate first. Use 10% of your income to do this. When the first one is paid off, use the 10% plus the interest you are now saving to pay off the next most expensive card/loan.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a budget you can stick to. You can find a great budget calculator here: <a href=""http://www.gailvazoxlade.com/resources/interactive_budget_worksheet.html"">http://www.gailvazoxlade.com/resources/interactive_budget_worksheet.html</a></p></li>

"How are part-year California resident income taxes calculated?","5364","","<p>For the sake of simplicity, let's suppose that a person's total yearly income is $100,000, all as W2 wages from the same employer.  That person lived in one state from January 1 - June 30, and then moved to California on July 1, and lived there for the remainder of the year.</p>

<p>A quick reading of the <a href=""https://www.ftb.ca.gov/individuals/fileRtn/Nonresidents_PartYear_Residents.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">official California tax site</a> suggests that the CA income tax would be based on $50,000 (i.e. the amount of yearly income the person earned while a resident of the state, which was for exactly 1/2 of the year).</p>

<p>But then I found <a href=""http://sweatingthebigstuff.com/california-tax-calculation-steals-money-from-partyear-residents/"" rel=""nofollow"">this site</a>, which suggests something very different (that the amount of tax is based on the $100,000 yearly income, but simply divided by 2 due to the half-year residency).</p>

<p>So which one is correct?  Do the progressive brackets ""reset"" when one takes up residency?</p>
","<p>Progressive tax brackets do <em>not</em> reset when you switch residency in most States.</p>

<p>In California, specifically, the tax is calculate on the total income and then the portion of the income that is attributed to California is calculated. Out of the total tax you calculated (see <a href=""https://www.ftb.ca.gov/forms/2013/13_540nrlongins.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">instructions for line 31</a>), you pay the prorated amount based on the rate of the income attributed to California out of the total income (see <a href=""https://www.ftb.ca.gov/forms/2013/13_540nrlongins.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">instructions for line 37</a>).</p>

<p>The income attributed to California is income earned in California, or worldwide income while CA resident. So you cannot just divide your total income by 2 because you lived half a year elsewhere, you need to check each item of income, and see to which State (or States) it should be attributed to.</p>

<p>If you earned $100K a year, moved to CA on July 1st, and out of the 100K you earned 90K in August - you cannot say that only half of the income is attributed to California just because of the half-year residency.</p>

"Are you allowed to have both a 401(k) and a SIMPLE IRA? If so, what about limits?","5347","","<p>Are you allowed to have both a 401(k) and a SIMPLE IRA?  And what would the limits be on the combined total? </p>

<p>I have two employers but I am maxed out at one.  My understanding is that I can't use a SIMPLE at the other - is this true? (The other is a small business I run.)</p>
","<p>I am not 100% sure, but I think the answer is this:  You can't max out both.  You could theoretically max out the SIMPLE IRA ($11,500) and then contribute $4,000 to your 401k, but your total can't exceed the 401k limit of $16,500.  This also means you could max out your 401k at $16,500, but you couldn't contribute anything to the SIMPLE IRA.  Note that no matter what, you can't contribute more than $11,500 to your SIMPLE IRA.</p>

<p>(Note that this is all independent from your Traditional or Roth IRA, which are subject to their own limits, and not affected by your participation in employer-sponsored plans.)</p>

<p>As I understand it, a 401k and a SIMPLE IRA both fall under the umbrella of ""employer-sponsored plans"".  Just like you can't max out two 401k's at two different employers, you can't do it with the 401k and the SIMPLE IRA.  The only weird thing is the contribution limit differences between SIMPLE IRA and 401k, but I don't think the IRS could/would penalize you for working two jobs (enforcing the lower SIMPLE IRA limit for all employer-sponsored retirement accounts).</p>

<p>You should probably run the numbers, factoring in the employer match, and figure out which account-contribution scenario makes the most financial sense for you.  However, I'm not sure how the employer match helps you when you're talking about a small business that you own/run.  You may also want to look at how the employer match of the SIMPLE IRA affects the taxes your business pays.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer #1:</strong>  I couldn't find a definitive answer on your specific scenario at irs.gov.  I pieced the above info from a few different ""SIMPLE IRA info"" sites.

<p>What is this ""Revenue Credit""? Why is it a credit?</p>

","<p>A quick search via google shows that some 401K programs are refunding money to the employees if the cost of running the program were lower than originally estimated.</p>

<p>Here is one such explanation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As was communicated in the plan transition guide in September 2012,
  the University of Washington has negotiated a fee credit from
  Fidelity. Beginning in January 2013, a credit was allocated to
  participants who invest in mutual funds for which Fidelity receives
  revenue to offset administrative costs. (See Appendix). </p>
  
  <p>Revenue
  credits are commonly negotiated for and given to plan sponsors in
  order to help them offset plan expenses. Rather than keep this credit,
  however, the UW has chosen to reallocate it back to the participants
  who actually hold the funds. </p>

""Beans and rice and rice and beans"" is his catch phrase for illustrating that living below your means and never borrowing now will keep you from ever having to borrow.  Better to learn to live without if you can't pay cash.  Ramsey, in my opinion, treats debt like an addiction and wants to 12 step you out of it.</p>

"How do amortization schedules work and when are they used?","5325","","<p>Specifically, I notice that on a mortgage statement, my payment is ""amortized"" so that at the beginning of the loan, I am paying almost entirely interest and very little principal.</p>

<p>However, on a credit card balance, it seems interest is only charged on the balance.</p>

<p>Why do amortization schedules work the way they do, and are they typically used for most loans, and why?</p>
","<h2>What is Amortization?</h2>

<p>An amortization schedule is often used to produce identical payments for the term (repayment period) of a loan, resulting in the principal being paid off and the debt retired at the end of the loan. This is in contrast to an interest only, or balloon loan. These loans require little or no payment against the balance of the loan, requiring the loan to be paid indefinitely if there is no term, or requiring the loan to be entirely paid off from cash or a new loan at the end of the term.</p>

<p>A basic amortization formula can be derived from the compound interest formula: 
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fmth5.png"" alt=""Amortization formula from Wikipedia:  P = A*(1-(1/(1+r))^n)/r""></p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortization_%28business%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This formula comes from the Wikipedia article on amortization</a>. The basics of the formula are the periodic payment amount, A (your monthly payment), can be determined by the principal loan, P, the rate, r, and the number of payments, n. </p>

<h2>Why Amortize?</h2>

<p>Lenders lend money to make a profit on the interest. They'd like to get back all the money they lent out. Amortization schedules are popular because the fixed low payments make it easier for borrowers to pay the loan off eventually. They also tend to be very profitable for lenders, especially at the start of the term, because they make a lot of profit on interest, just like the start of your mortgage.</p>

<p>The principal of a mortgage has more meaning than the principal of a revolving debt credit card. The mortgage principal is fixed at the start, and represents the value of the collateral property that is your home. You could consider the amount of principal paid to be the percentage of your home that you actually own (as part of your net worth calculation). </p>

<h3>Credit Card Amortization</h3>

<p>A credit card has a new balance each month depending on how much you charge and how much you pay off. Principal has less meaning in this case, because there is no collateral to compare against, and the balance will change monthly. In this case, the meaning of the amortization schedule on your credit card is how long it will take you to pay off the balance if you stop charging and pay at the proscribed payment level over the term described. Given the high interest rate on credit cards, you may end up paying twice as much for goods in the long run if you follow your lenders schedule.</p>

<h2>Who Amortizes?</h2>

<p>Amortizing loans are common for consumer loans, unless a borrower is seeking out the lowest possible monthly payment. Lenders recognize that people will eventually die, and want to be paid off before that happens. Balloon and interest only bonds and loans are more commonly issued by businesses and governments who are (hopefully) investing in capital improvements that will pay off in the long run. Thousands of people and businesses have gone bankrupt in this financial crisis because their interest only loans reached term, and no one was willing to lend them money anymore to replace their existing loan.</p>

Does it make sense to use that ratio?</p>
","<h1>Short answer</h1>

<p>That ratio is a decent approximation of the market cap distribution in VTSMX, although it's not perfect because the two funds you have access to, VIIIX and VIEIX, overlap somewhat in their holdings. The S&amp;P 500 and the completion index don't. Using the S&amp;P 500 and the completion index as relative weights gives you (14.7+3.4)/14.7 = 81.2% and 1-0.812 = 18.8% for VIIIX and VIEIX, respectively.</p>

<p>We can verify that this is close to the best allocation using either of the two methods below. Based on that, it's safe to say that an allocation of 81% to VIIIX and 19% to VIEIX should replicate VTSMX pretty well. Remember that because of expense ratios (among other factors), the returns to your replicated portfolio may not match the returns to the target portfolio exactly.</p>

Large                    36.20         5.38

</code></pre>

<p>We want to find allocations for VIIIX and VIEIX, i.e. two percentages that sum to 1, that give us a portfolio with a market cap distribution as close to that of VTSMX as possible. There are several methods that would work for this; both return the same solution:</p>

<h3>Method 1: Goal-seeking in Excel</h3>

<p>Using the goal-seek feature of Excel, I found that allocating 80.5712423979149% of your portfolio to VIIIX and the remainder (19.4287576%) to VIEX yields this distribution (shown in the ""replicated"" column), which is pretty close. The second data column is VTSMX, the fund you're trying to replicate. </p>

<pre><code>Market Cap           % (replicated)       % (VTSMX)       ""% Error""
Giant                  41.40                 41.42         0.0471
Large                  30.21                 30.50         0.9441
Medium                 19.35                 19.47         0.6037
Small                  6.41                  6.20          3.3899
Micro                  2.62                  2.41          8.9139
</code></pre>

<p>This gives me the allocation of approximately 81% to VIIIX and 19% to VIEIX that I listed in the short answer above. The percent error, which is calculated as the absolute value of the difference between the allocations divided by the allocation in VTSMX, increases as market capitalization decreases, but that shouldn't bother you. Since allocation decreases as market cap decreases, even though the error grows as market cap decreases, that error represents an increasingly small amount of the fund's actual value. </p>

<p>This isn't a perfect system, because I'm abusing the notion of ""weighted percent errors"" a little here, but hopefully the idea is clear.</p>

<h3>Method 2: Matrices</h3>

<p>In this specific case, matrices provide a much more robust, and arguably logical, strategy. From a mathematical perspective, this is the problem we're trying to solve:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eqZEJ.png"" alt=""system of equations""></p>

<p>where <code>w1</code> and <code>w2</code> are the percentage allocations of VIIIX and VIEIX, respectively, that you want in your 401K portfolio. At first glance, it looks like you can simply solve the last equation for <code>w2</code> and substitute that value into any of the first four equations to solve for <code>w1</code>; unfortunately, if you try this strategy with the fourth equation, you get a value of <code>w1 = 4.2816</code>, but if you try this with the third equation, you get <code>w1 = 0.87716</code>. If you try using the value of <code>w1</code> that came from the fourth equation in any of the other equations (besides the fifth one, in which it doesn't matter) you'll find it won't work. The same goes for the <code>w1</code> that came from the third equation, or the second, or the first.</p>

<p>It seems we have a problem. All is not lost, however. If you've ever taken an algebra course, you can see that the system of equations above looks like this matrix equation:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/n46hW.png"" alt=""matrix equation""></p>

<p>I labeled the numerical matrix on the left-hand side of the equation <code>A</code> to save space. The linear algebra theory probably isn't exciting to everyone as it is to me, so I'll keep it short. Since <code>A</code> is a 5x2 matrix with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank_%28linear_algebra%29"">rank</a> 2, it therefore has a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_element#Matrices"">left inverse</a>, which we can calculate like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xkiwb.png"" alt=""left inverse""></p>

<p>With our left-inverse in hand, we can quickly find the solution to the matrix equation like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6Sq8r.png"" alt=""solution""></p>

<p>which gives us the same solution that we found with Excel. It's also important to understand that this is the ""best"" solution to the problem; in other words, we have found the weights of VIIIX and VIEIX that replicates the market cap distribution of VTSMX as closely as possible. </p>

<p>If you've ever taken a statistics or econometrics course, you might recognize the calculation and application of the left-inverse as the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression#Least-squares_estimation_and_related_techniques"">ordinary least squares (OLS)</a> estimation of the weights; that means that in this case, ""closest"" implies that the weights we found minimize the sum of the squares of the differences (""errors"" or ""residuals"") between our replicated portfolio and VTSMX.</p>

<p>While the matrix/OLS method seems more complicated, I include it because it may be much quicker computationally than using Excel if you attempt to replicate a portfolio using more than two funds. The matrix/OLS method also scales very well in situations where more than two funds are used in the replication. Also, in this case, we had the relative weights of the S&amp;P 500 and the Completion Index to use as guides, but once we start adding more funds with potentially more overlapping holdings between them, calculating a simple ratio may not work nearly as well. In the more complex case, however, even a simple linear regression may not work, and you would need to use methods of constrained regression and linear/quadratic programming to make this work (if it works at all). </p>

<h3>Result/portfolio comparison</h3>

<p>If you substitute the weights <code>w1</code> and <code>w2</code> you found, either in Excel or using matrices, into the left-hand side of the original system of equations or the matrix equation (in statistical parlance, you're calculating the linear predicted values)</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1Qddr.png"" alt=""predicted values""></p>

<p>you can see that your replicated portfolio doesn't match the market cap allocation in VTSMX exactly; specifically, it over-allocates to giant, small, and micro cap stocks while under-allocating to large and medium cap companies. </p>

<p>I was curious how the replicated portfolio would perform against VTSMX, so I ran a quick simulation in MATLAB to compare the performance of each portfolio. First, I made a few assumptions:</p>

<ol>
<li>At the start of a ten-year period, you invest $10,000 in each portfolio. For each month in the same period, you invest an additional $1,000. </li>
<li>I de-annualized the <a href=""http://www.fatpitchfinancials.com/2071/returns-by-market-capitalization-over-the-past-decade/"">average annual return</a> for giant/mega, large, medium/mid, small, and micro cap stocks using the formula <code>1 + annual = (1 + monthly)^12</code>. Another option would be to find a set of weights that hit the <a href=""https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0085&amp;FundIntExt=INT#tab=1"">average 10-year return</a> for VTSMX.</li>
<li>I calculated the weighted expense ratio for the replicated portfolio in the same way I calculated the predicted values. Using the expense ratios of <a href=""https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0854&amp;FundIntExt=INT"">VIIIX</a> (0.02%) and <a href=""https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0856&amp;FundIntExt=INT"">VIEIX</a> (0.12%), this gives me a weighted expense ratio of 0.039%. </li>
<li>I ignored inflation, since it should apply equally to both VTSMX and the replicated portfolio</li>
<li>I ignored transaction costs; I think this is a safe assumption to make when purchasing mutual funds.</li>
</ol>

<p>The results of the simulation:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hqKGd.png"" alt=""comparison between VTSMX and replicated portfolio""></p>

<p>As you can see, the replicated portfolio closely matches VTSMX. The final value of the VTSMX portfolio is $185,561.89; for the replicated portfolio, it's $185,992.72. </p>

<p>The replicated portfolio outperforms the VTSMX portfolio partly because the replicated portfolio is comprised of <em>institutional</em> shares, which have much lower expense ratios than the investor shares the VTSMX uses (the market cap distribution also makes a difference). Even if you invested in the <a href=""https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0585&amp;FundIntExt=INT"">VTSAX</a>, the Admiral Shares equivalent of VTSMX, which has a much lower expense ratio of 0.05%, the weighted expense ratio is <em>still</em> lower at 0.039318 and your return <em>still</em> outpaces the benchmark fund (VTASX in this case). The final results are $185,580.43 and $185,992.72 for VTSAX and the replicated portfolio, respectively. The distance has narrowed, but it's not enough for the Vanguard fund to beat your portfolio. </p>

<h3>Caveats</h3>

<p>Although these average returns may not accurately represent the holdings in VTSMX or your replicated portfolio and the average returns statistics for each market cap may represent slightly different holdings than those of the Vanguard funds, these nuances don't pose a problem in this example because I'm using the <em>same</em> benchmark to estimate the returns on VTSMX and the replicated portfolio.</p>

<p>Here is the MATLAB code for the simulation; I made the chart in Excel. </p>

"Received federal student loan collection letter, but never had one. What to do?","5315","","<p>Yesterday I received an unexpected letter in the mail, a federal student loan collection letter from ConServe collections.  I've never had a federal student loan, so it was quite surprising to receive such a gift!</p>

<p>The letter is a little strange.  It has my full name on the address header, but <em>not</em> my correct address.  After some family research, the address on the letter is my grandmother's, and I never lived at this address before.  It seems that my grandmother received the letter, and then penciled in my correct address and forwarded it along.  I can still see her handwriting peeking out from under the yellow US post office forwarding sticker.</p>

<p>I googled ConServe, and they seem like a real company.  The NY Times did an article on student loan collection practices, and a significant portion was dedicated to the company.  </p>

<p>After verifying ConServe was a real company, I called the number on ConServe's website to investigate.  After explaining the situation, I gave the customer representative the account number on the letter, but carefully did not reveal any personal information.  She then requested my name, to which I responded that, to verify that this was not fraud, could she please tell me the name on the account.  She gave me the first name, which was indeed mine.  I thought this sufficient, so I completed with my last name, and this matched up.  </p>

<p>Next she asked for the last four digits of my Social Security Number. I believe that these are safe to reveal, so I did.  They did <em>not</em> match the account (phew)!</p>

<p>Finally, I pulled my credit reports from all three major reporting agencies.  This loan and collection do <em>not</em> appear on my report as of yesterday evening (June 29th).  The letter I received is dated June 12th.</p>

<p>So my questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Should I take any defensive steps to protect myself?</li>
<li>What could have happened to cause me to receive this letter?</li>
</ul>
","<p>You've already done everything I would suggest:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Contact the collections agency, being careful in what personal information you provide.</p></li>
<li><p>Check all three of your credit reports, for any trace of incorrect information.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>At this point, since you've confirmed that the social security number that the collections agency has does not match yours, and you've confirmed that you have nothing in your credit report about this debt, I don't think you need to worry about it.</p>

<p>Collections agencies employ a number of tactics to try to collect on bad debt.  The first dilemma they have is finding the debtor.  Sometimes this is easier than other times.  In this case, they obviously don't know where this person is, so they just started contacting people that have the same name as the debtor, hoping that they will get lucky.  Intimidation is a major collections agency tactic, so I'm sure the letter you got was strongly worded.</p>

<p>Your phone call to them may or may not have convinced them that they have the wrong person.  (Believe it or not, people sometimes lie to collections agencies.)  So the biggest thing you may have to deal with is continued harassment by the agency.  If they think you are lying to them, you can expect more phone calls and more harassment.</p>

<p>The FTC has <a href=""https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0149-debt-collection"">a FAQ page about debt collection</a>.  If you hear from them again, don't fall for any intimidation tactics that they might say to you.  Just tell them not to contact you again, and report them if they do.  They will eventually get the message and go away.</p>

"Should there be a copay after ""out-of-pocket maximum""","5312","","<p>I have individual health insurance and have met my out-of-pocket maximum due to a surgery earlier this year.</p>

<p>I saw my (in-network) PCP this week and was still charged the regular $30 copay. Should that have been waived, will I get a check back, or does it not matter that I've met the ""maximum"" and still have copays for covered expenses?</p>
","<p>Generally speaking, under an standard Obamacare plan, you should not have to pay any copays or coinsurance on any <a href=""https://obamacarefacts.com/essential-health-benefits/"" rel=""noreferrer"">essential benefits</a> once you have met your out-of-pocket maximum (<a href=""https://obamacarefacts.com/health-insurance/out-of-pocket-maximum/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Obamacarefacts.com</a>).</p>

<p>In practice, however, there are a few complicating factors:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Did the money you spend so far count towards your out-of-pocket maximum?</strong> If you payed for uncovered out-of-network care, or other non essential benefits, your insurance company may not count that towards your maximum out of pocket expenses.</li>
<li><strong>Have all the claims been processed?</strong> While you often pay your co-pay at the time of service, the insurance claims process is much slower. Your insurance company may not have caught up with all of your bills, and so have not yet calculated your total out-of-pocket costs so far.</li>
<li><strong>Is your insurance company making a mistake?</strong> Be sure to review your EOBs and bills and make sure everything seems to match up and make sense according to your insurance contract. Insurance companies can make mistakes, and those mistakes usually aren't in your favor (at least that is my personal experience). Keep an eye out for possible mistakes, and call your insurance company if you think you have found one.</li>
<li><strong>Even if your insurance company doesn't think you owe a co-pay, your doctor doesn't know that:</strong> Your doctor's office probably just bills whatever co-pay they see written on your card. It is unlikely that they can tell that you already met your maximum-out-of-pocket until the claim is processed by your insurance company. If you know you met your maximum-out-of-pocket already, just explain that to the receptionist (or whoever does the billing) when they ask you for your co-pay.</li>
</ol>

<p>As for unnecessary co-pays you already payed: In my experience, the insurance company will pay the claim without applying a co-pay, and leave it up to the doctor to refund your co-pay. However, you should call <em>your</em> insurance company to verify this. If they do tell you to get a refund from your doctors office, wait until you get the EOB for the vist (which should show you owe no copay) and bring it in to your doctor's office when you ask for a refund.</p>

"Calculating the profit earned from a leveraged futures contract","5302","","<p>How do we calculate the profit/loss of Futures contract? For example, If I had a Futures contract that had $10 000 as the underlying, it had $1000 margin and the Futures contract itself was worth $3. Then I would safe to say that current amount money I can make is $10 000 * $3 = $30 000. Therefore, if the price the price of the stock goes up by $1 then I have effectively made another $10 000$ because $4 * $10 000 = $40 000.</p>

<p>In other words is the current profit/loss of a Futures contract:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>P_underlying * P_futures</p>
</blockquote>
","<p>I'm not entirely sure about some of the details in your question, since I think you meant to use $10,000 as the value of the futures contract and $3 as the value of the underlying stock. Those numbers would make more sense.</p>

<p>That being said, I <em>can</em> give you a simple example of how to calculate the profit and loss from a leveraged futures contract. For the sake of simplicity, I'll use a well-known futures contract: the <a href=""http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/us-index/e-mini-sandp500_contract_specifications.html"">E-mini S&amp;P500 contract</a>. Each E-mini is worth $50 times the value of the S&amp;P 500 index and has a tick size of 0.25, so the minimum price change is 0.25 * $50 = $12.50. </p>

<p>Here's an example. Say the current value of the S&amp;P500 is 1,600; the value of each contract is therefore $50 * 1,600 = $80,000. You purchase one contract on margin, with an <a href=""http://www.cmegroup.com/clearing/margins/#e=CME&amp;a=EQUITY+INDEX&amp;p=ES"">initial margin requirement</a><sup>1</sup> of 5%, or $4,000. If the S&amp;P 500 index rises to 1,610, the value of your futures contract increases to $50 * 1,610 = $80,500. Once you return the 80,000 - 4,000 = $76,000 that you borrowed as leverage, your profit is 80,500 - 76,000 = $4,500. </p>

<p>Since you used $4,000 of your own funds as an initial margin, your profit, excluding commissions is 4,500 - 4,000 = $500, which is a 500/4000 = 12.5% return. If the index dropped to 1,580, the value of your futures contract decreases to $50 * 1,580 = $79,000. After you return the $76,000 in leverage, you're left with $3,000, or a net loss of (3,000 - 4000)/(4000) = -25%.</p>

<hr>

<p>The math illustrates why using leverage increases your risk, but also increases your potential for return. Consider the first scenario, in which the index increases to 1,610. If you had forgone using margin and spent $80,000 of your own funds, your profit would be (80,500 - 80,000) / 80000 = .625%. This is smaller than your leveraged profit by a factor of 20, the inverse of the margin requirement (.625% / .05 = 12.5%). In this case, the use of leverage dramatically increased your rate of return. </p>

<p>However, in the case of a decrease, you spent $80,000, but gained $79,000, for a loss of only 1.25%. This is 20 times <em>smaller</em> in magnitude than your negative return when using leverage. By forgoing leverage, you've decreased your opportunity for upside, but also decreased your downside risk.</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1) For futures contracts, the margin requirements are set by the exchange, which is CME group, in the case of the E-mini. The 5% in my example is higher than the actual margin requirement, which is currently $3,850 USD per contract, but it keeps the numbers simple. Also note that CME group refers to the initial margin as the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_bond"">performance bond</a> instead.</sup></p>
