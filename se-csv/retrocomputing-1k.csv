"How can I figure out how much caffeine is in my cup?","53773","","<p>I haven't been able to find a good way to approximate the amount of caffeine in the coffee I make. Googling yields information like <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/caffeine/art-20049372"">this Mayo Clinic article</a> that mixes serving sizes and brewing methods, and it reports one 8 oz coffee contains ""95-200 mg"" of caffeine, which is a huge range. If I have three cups of coffee in a day, is that 300 or 600 mg of caffeine?</p>

<p>There are so many variables in prepared coffee, different extraction methods, beans, roasts, serving sizes, mixed with different amounts of water or milk. </p>

<p><strong>Is there a general method for calculating the caffeine in prepared coffee?</strong> Something like ""most brewing methods extract <em>X</em> mg of caffeine from each <em>Y</em> grams of ground coffee""?</p>

<p>Or more specifically, what method would I use to accurately estimate how much caffeine is in an 8oz serving from my 10 oz french press, made with medium- (not course-) ground medium-roast arabica beans, brewed 4 minutes before decanting?</p>
","<p>I read everyone's answer and did some of my own research to find an estimation method that satisfies me and might be helpful to others too. I think it should be roughly ±20% accurate.</p>

<h1>For any amount of ""good strength"" American-style coffee by any brew method, weigh the dry coffee in grams and multiply by 0.008, or 80mg of caffeine for each 10g of dry coffee.</h1>

<p>Weakly extracted coffee might yield 0.6% of its weight in caffeine and very strongly extracted coffee might get close to 1% caffeine. </p>

<p>These numbers are for typical 100% Arabica or mostly Arabica blends. 100% Robusta beans (uncommon) could be about double the caffeine.</p>

<p>Explanation below:</p>

<h2>Maximum caffeine content</h2>

<p>Typical premium roasted Arabica coffee beans like mine contain <a href=""http://www.academia.edu/6246212/Analytical_Methods_Measurement_of_caffeine_in_coffee_beans_with_UV_vis_spectrometer"" rel=""noreferrer"">close to 1% caffeine by mass when measured by spectrophotometer (p 311)</a>
though Robusta (less common and usually blended with Arabica in cheaper coffees) has
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robusta_coffee"" rel=""noreferrer"">roughly twice that
much</a>. </p>

<p>If you have a health concern like wanting to stay under the 300 mg guideline for pregnant women, you should be able to use this as the upper limit: <strong>each 10g of Arabica coffee contains about 100mg of caffeine.</strong></p>

<p>I use a 2 Tbsp scoop to measure beans before I grind them. One scoop of
beans weighs about <strong>12 grams</strong> (yes I tared the scoop, but I did only weigh
once and am not comparing light or dark roasts which will vary in weight
and volume).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NwqDW.jpg"" alt=""2Tbsp scoop of beans weighing 12g""></p>

<p>So if I <em>eat</em> that scoop of beans or grind them finely and drink them
with any amount of water I will be consuming the <strong>120 mg (1% of 12g) of caffeine</strong>
present in them. That should be an upper limit to this estimation
exercise. <em>The strongest <strong>or</strong> biggest/weakest cup of coffee I can brew with
that scoop of beans will have <strong>no more than</strong> 120mg caffeine</em>. </p>

<h2>How strong is my cup?</h2>

<p>Typical American-style brewing methods and water ratios result in 
<a href=""http://www.mountaincity.com/brewing-1.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">1% (weak) to 1.65% (too strong) disolved coffee solids, with 1.25%
considered optimal</a> whereas 
<a href=""http://www.coffeechemistry.com/brewing/brewing-fundamentals.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">""a typical espresso will contain on average 1.8-2.2%""
solids</a></p>

<p>So 1 fl oz of brewed coffee or espresso weighs almost the same as water
(29.57 g) and contains 1-2% coffee solids (so about 300-600mg, or 380mg solids for optimal brewed coffee and 600mg solids for espresso). That would be the upper limit if the coffee solids were pure caffeine, but they can't be. </p>

<p>On the other hand,the caffeine is probably more soluble than the other parts of the bean,so even though it's only 1% of the mass of the beans it's probably more than 1% of the dissolved solids. That's the hard part. Coffeechemistry.com says brewed coffee ends up with <a href=""http://coffeechemistry.com/caffeine/caffeine-content-in-espresso-vs-drip-coffee1.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">8-15 mg caffeine per oz and espresso 30-50 mg caffeine per oz</a>. That's a pretty huge range. It means caffeine is 2.5-4.0% of the solids (380 mg) in an ounce of ""optimal"" brewed coffee or 5.0-8.3% of the solids (600 mg) in an ounce of espresso.</p>

<p>So: I typically make a nice strong 10 oz cup of coffee with my 12g of
beans containing a maximum of 120mg (or 1% of the coffee mass) caffeine. So let's say this maximum 12 mg caffeine per each oz of coffee corresponds to 1.65% or 500 mg solids (1.65% of 29.57 gr = 500 mg). In this case the 12 mg caffeine is 2.4% of the solids. If I brew it ""too weak"" and it ends up 1% solids (or 300 mg per oz) I would guess I'd proportionally get no more than 60% of the max caffeine, 7.2 mg (again 2.4% of the solids) per oz or 72 mg for a 10oz cup. So that narrows the range to 72-120 mg of caffeine in my cup depending on the brew strength.</p>

<p>I'm guessing a good cup ends up somewhere in the middle, so I'm going to estimate my typical cup contains <strong>around 100 mg of caffeine from its 12g dry coffee,</strong> or about 80% of the maximum caffeine present in the beans. From this I would suggest a decent rule of thumb for ""optimal"" strength American-style brewed coffee is around <strong>0.8% (or 0.008) of the mass of the beans used, or 80mg of caffeine for each 10g of dry coffee.</strong></p>

<h3>Bonus corollary/sanity check</h3>

<p>Using the same method, a shot of espresso made with <a href=""http://www.coffeeforums.com/forum/coffee-drinks/2733-how-much-grounds-used-make-espresso.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">7g of ground
coffee</a> maxes out around 70mg caffeine (77mg if 10% Robusta sometimes typical for Espresso blends), but the serving size and strength are more standardized than brewed coffee, so the <strong>64mg/shot</strong> reported by <a href=""https://www.google.com/#q=caffeine%20in%20espresso"" rel=""noreferrer"">the USDA and others</a> also ends up being 80-90% of the caffeine present in the beans.</p>

"End result of Americano vs Long Black?","39958","","<p>There have been a few questions now asked about the difference between a Caffe Americano vs a Long Black and the merits of each (<a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/164/when-making-a-long-black-how-long-should-hot-water-cool-before-adding-espresso"">here</a> and <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/402/procedure-for-making-a-caffe-americano/404#404"">here</a>).  The main difference seems to be that the Long Black method of adding the espresso after the hot water preserves the crema better.</p>

<p>I conducted an experiment and created an Americano and a Long Black simultaneously using a La Marzocco. Immediately after brewing the result was as expected with the Long Black having more crema.  However, by the time they had sat a bit and cooled enough to drink (approximately 2 minutes), the crema had broken down and they looked almost identical.</p>

<p>Does the crema breaking up during brewing (Americano) or shortly thereafter (Long Black) really make a difference/affect the taste?  If not, is the difference merely academic or is there some other reason why the order of operations matters?</p>
","<p>The crema definitely affects the initial taste of the coffee, that's where the concentrated notes of whatever bean you're using is going to be found. </p>

<p>I make a long black by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pour 3/4 cup of hot water (right from the machine)</li>
<li>Wait 2 - 3 minutes</li>
<li>Pull a double shot into it, holding it <em>right</em> under the group to minimize splashing</li>
<li>Let sit for about 30 seconds, serve</li>
</ul>

<p>In contrast, I make an Americano by just pulling a double shot into a cup while also taking care to minimize splashing, then I serve it with a small steel or ceramic carafe of hot water (everyone likes a little more or a little less than everyone else).</p>

<p>In both instances, I heat the cup, and that's important because the crema will quickly break up on the walls of the cup if you don't. Most good espresso machines allow you to heat cups on the top of them. </p>

<p>Now, my testing is somewhat limited because I drink good quality Arabica beans pretty much exclusively. Arabica has some subtle flavors and it's easy to tell when they're more pronounced. Long blacks <em>do</em> hit the caramel notes more, in my experience. But, I usually just make myself an Americano because it's easier and the taste isn't all <em>that</em> different. </p>

<p>Done at home using a <a href=""http://www.brevilleusa.com/the-barista-expresstm.html"">Breville Barista Express</a> in manual mode. You don't really need a super expensive machine to replicate this, you just need the ability to pre-infuse, warm the cup, and be able to wrangle one under the group to minimize splashing. </p>

<p>Concluding, I think there's some substance to this. However, I'm not sure how much it really matters to someone kind of fumbling around to get their first cup of the day. It took close to a dozen tries to finally get a process down where the taste was noticeable and I could reliably reproduce it. </p>

<p>If you order either at your average coffee shop, I don't know that you'd be able to tell the difference, I never have. </p>

"Milk quantity and consistency in cortado, cappuccino and latte","37017","","<p>I am often asked whether these three drinks have the same milk quantity and/or consistency and where the difference really lies between these preparations.</p>

<p>I would assume that quantity is increased respectively (cortado &lt; cappuccino &lt; latte) but some claim that there is more milk in the cortado than the cappuccino.</p>

<p>As for the consistency, wouldn't the cappuccino have a more foamy milk than the other two?</p>

<p>There could be some argument over cappuccino vs. latte as to which is ""creamier"" as the cappuccino certainly has more mil foam, but the latte has much more milk by volume and by ratio. On the whole though I'd say the latte is a less strong drink with a creamier texture even if the cappuccino is thicker. </p>

<p>Is there a difference in grind, extraction time, amount of coffee used, temperature, volume of water?</p>

<p>If so, what are the differences?</p>
","<p>A long (luongo) and a short (ristretto) shot have two key differences.</p>

<p>The amount of coffee used virtually stays the same although it can increase slightly with a ristretto shot, as the grind is finer.</p>

<p>The key similarity between these two shots and a normal shot is that the <strong>extraction time stays the same</strong>. <em>The grind is altered</em> to achieve this - coarser for a long shot and finer for a ristretto shot.  This, ideally, alters the volume of water which can pass through the coffee.</p>

<p>For a long shot, the volume should be <strong>twice</strong> that of a standard espresso shot and for a ristretto shot, the volume should be <strong>half</strong> that of a standard espresso shot.</p>

"Why isn't coffee commonly sold in sachets, like tea bags?","28222","","<p>I was wondering why single serving coffee <a href=""http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sachet"">sachets</a> never really took off the way tea bags have. The only explanation I could find was that steeping coffee too long makes the coffee taste bad, but it seems like that could be avoided by removing the bag.</p>

<p>Why would the end result be terribly different than a french press, Turkish brew, or cowboy coffee? </p>
","<p>As a matter of fact, coffee is ""commonly"" sold in some kind of sachets.</p>

<p>In Japan, there is what is called ""one-drip bag coffee"". It consists of a flat sachet that you can unfold to deploy a small scaffold. The scaffold adapts to any mug-like cups. It unveils a filter containing ground coffee, as it unfolds. You just need to pour hot water in the filter to get a decent cup of coffee.</p>

<p>I will not link to any maker or brand, but most coffee dealers in Japan offer these bags---pretty convenient and offering a decent cup for the price. These bags seem somewhat popular in Japan.</p>

<p>I am not sure about global availability, though. Several countries do not sell them (e.g. Europe, perhaps because of the French / Italian influences).</p>

"Is it safe to use paper towel as a filter when brewing?","26499","","<p>Are there any chemicals or dyes in most common paper towels that would be harmful if I brewed my coffee using the towel as a filter?</p>

<p>In this <a href=""https://lifehacks.stackexchange.com/a/5642/2475"">answer</a> in Lifehacks.SE, the accepted answer includes instructions to create a coffee filter out of paper towels. The full instrctions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I tried to create a similar filter device with a paper towel and it worked perfectly.</p>
  
  <p>Here is what I did:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><em>First</em>, make sure you have paper towels... seems foolish to mention, but hey... its true!
  
  <ul>
  <li>Approximate the size of your basket with your hand and tear a circle out of the paper towel bout an inch (+/- 2cm) wider than the basket size.</li>
  <li>Place the paper into the basket and push the center down to touch the bottom.</li>
  <li>the ""buckled"" edged should then be folded into an accordion (similar to the shape of a normal filter) -- this will help to maintain a ""wall"" for the water and grounds so they do not overflow into the drink.</li>
  <li>Place the coffee grounds into the basket in a normal fashion and brew.</li>
  </ul></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>My formatting skills are rather rusty... So in conclusion, it's safe to use paper towels with no risk or worry! But I'll answer your concerns for you.</p>

<p><del>Since when do paper towels need dye? They're white, so no need for artificial colors here, all they need is some machine to make the cool patterns and all the other cool stuff. Same goes for chemicals.</del> Read the comments for that answer for more information about chemicals that may be inside the paper towel. White paper towels are usually the ones with the lowest chemical content compared to other colored paper towels. </p>

<p>According to the comments, brown paper towels will make your coffee taste like one. Not good at all. Bleached towels should be avoided as they contain bleach or CI (chlorine). And who knows what hidden chemicals could be used in the non-bleached ones, any from A-Z really. So use the paper towels with caution as you might be drinking bleached coffee instead...</p>

"Brewing with the same coffee grounds twice?","26453","","<p>My new job has me buying my own coffee for the first time in my professional career.  I'm amazed at the amount of coffee I consume.  I brew at my desk using an aeropress.  Has anyone tried to use the grounds more than once?  Any tips as I try it out?</p>
","<p>In general, I argue that <strong>you <em>shouldn't be able to</em> re-use the grounds.</strong> That is, for any brewing session, your goal is to extract exactly what you want from the beans. If you do this optimally for your method and taste, there's nothing left in the beans that you want; re-extracting will give you a different result. The second brew might be drinkable and even tasty, but it will have a disproportionately small amount of stuff you might want, like caffeine and other flavour compounds. </p>

<p>That said, @Madmanta's answer makes a good point: it might work in some cases, such as Aeropress or espresso. But this suggests <strong>you might want to change other parameters of your brewing</strong>. If you can re-brew your coffee with a result that you like, you might be able to, for example, use less grounds. This saves money, which sounds like it's part of your goal. Alternatively, you could brew a larger cup of coffee with the same amount of beans, or increase the extraction time. In the case of AeroPress, for example, I find that many of the recipes are decidedly under-extracted, so this might be an explanation for why a second brew works for you; see <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1564/what-do-the-terms-extraction-and-strength-mean"">this Q/A for what I mean by extraction</a> in this case.</p>

<p>You could <strong>try this experimentally</strong> also: brew a cup of Aeropress or pour-over as you usually do, then brew another batch in the same way. For example, I find the last few drops of pour-over brew to be watery and off-tasting but the entire batch tastes better together than either of the two parts separately. If you like it, go for it. Or use half the amount of grounds the next time. :)</p>

<p>As a practical note, you might also consider simply to <strong>brew a larger batch of coffee all in one go</strong>. You'll get a slightly different product but, for example, I find that I use way less grounds for a 10-cup thermal carafe than for 10 individual cups.</p>

"Is Nespresso 'real' espresso?","22672","","<p>When I use an espresso coffee pod, I'm a little skeptical that it qualifies as real espresso. The contents of the cup don't seem to be compressed or 'tamped' in any way, and obviously there's no portafilter involved. As far as I know, steam is simply pumped through the capsule to produce coffee.</p>

<p>It does come out very strong, and with a decent amount of crema, but is it actually espresso?</p>
","<p>Akin to the simultaneous fates of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schroedinger&#39;s_cat"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Schrödinger's Cat</a>, answers to your question include <strong><em>no</em></strong>, <strong><em>maybe</em></strong>, and <strong><em>it doesn't matter</em></strong>. I have furthermore been unable to avoid philosophical diversion and hypothetical questions in this answer; please forgive me. :)</p>

<p>As @EricPlaton noted in comments, the answer depends on a slightly different question: <strong>What characteristics define real espresso?</strong> Here I merely compare the beverages produced by the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>a <em>traditional espresso machine</em> (See <a href=""http://sydney.edu.au/engineering/it/~bob/Coffee/timeline.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this history of espresso machines and production techniques</a> for one view of what is <em>traditionally</em> espresso), and </li>
<li><em>capsule-based ""espresso"" systems</em>. There are several capsule-based espresso machines (<a href=""http://www.coffeereview.com/three-new-capsule-espresso-systems/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here's a review of Nespresso and three others</a>). You place a small coffee-filled capsule (a.k.a. ""pod"", made of aluminium, plastic, paper-wrapped, compressed puck, or other material) into the machine and press a button; seconds later it produces a coffee beverage. </li>
</ul>

<p>My answers:</p>

<h2>No.</h2>

<p>In simple point of fact, <strong>espresso is not <em>traditionally</em> made with a coffee-filled capsule</strong>, so the beverage produced by capsule-based machines might be disqualified from being called espresso on that trivial issue alone. :)</p>

<p>If you subscribe to the <a href=""http://www.espressoitaliano.org/en/The-Certified-Italian-Espresso.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">INEI</a> being a benchmark of <a href=""http://www.espressoitaliano.org/files/File/istituzionale_inei_hq_en.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">espresso production standards (PDF)</a>, <strong>capsule systems may not meet INEI parameters... so if they don't, they're not an espresso on technicality alone</strong>, with regard to ""Certified Italian Espresso"" at least. For example: </p>

<ol>
<li>quantity of coffee (e.g., <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nespresso"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Nespresso might be light</a>); </li>
<li>hot water should be used for espresso (some do use pressurized water; but it's not INEI espresso if the capsule system uses steam); </li>
<li>Some capsule systems (as noted by @EricPlaton below) <em>do</em> produce espresso-machine pressures, but there could be benefit (or problems) by <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/296/downsides-of-brewing-espresso-with-high-pressure"">using pressure that is too high</a>, or on the other hand <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/1563/262"">too low</a> for extraction and crema. That said, <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/58/whats-the-most-effective-way-of-generating-crema-from-an-aeropress"">it seems that AeroPress can create crema</a> at lower pressures, so perhaps the capsule systems produce a beverage more like AeroPress than espresso.[1]</li>
</ol>

<h2>Maybe.</h2>

<p>There have been several taste-tests of questionable ""legitimacy"" between capsule-based machines and traditional espresso machines. <a href=""http://aeon.co/magazine/culture/julian-baggini-coffee-artisans/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">One four-subject test</a> gave <em>higher marks</em> to the beverage produced from a capsule-based machine than a traditional espresso machine. <a href=""http://www.airtightinteractive.com/2008/09/starbucks-versus-nespresso-taste-test/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This one</a> agrees. Another test disagreed, <a href=""http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2013/04/nespresso-coffee-overpriced-rubbish/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">giving a capsule-based machine a scathing review</a>. Maybe there are better reviews out there; these are mostly useful for anecdotes.</p>

<p>As you note, the resulting beverage from a capsule-based espresso system is similar to traditional espresso, crema and all. However, if you ordered an espresso from a proper cafe, and they gave you a beverage that was brewed using a capsule-based machine, would you feel cheated on principle? What if the beverage was indistinguishable from traditional espresso... or if you like the capsule-based system's result better?</p>

<h2>It doesn't matter.</h2>

<p>This is my personal conclusion. The result of the beverage produced by a capsule-based system is a decent replica of proper espresso. Capsule systems also are likely to produce a <em>consistent</em> result. If you like the beverage that results (see above...), <strong>what difference does it make if it's <em>""real""</em> espresso or not?</strong></p>

Lately it's been having a lot of trouble pushing the water through the coffee.  We can hear the pump pumping, but the water just barely drips out.  We end up having to pull it 2 or 3 times to get a full shot (or just wait for the drips to fill up the shot glass).</p>

<p>How do I fix my machine so that the shots come out in a single pull?  I wonder if my pump just can form enough pressure anymore - can I measure the pressure?</p>

<p>A note on the grounds:  We have the grinder set to the finest grind, which comes out like a fine sand.  We've had it this way for a long time and not had any problems.  We fill the basket to about 1/2 full (it's a double shot basket, and we only need one shot - the single shot basket was fed to the garbage disposal years ago) and tamp.  I've been tamping more lightly recently, thinking that the problem was grounds that are too compressed to let the water through.</p>

","<p>As suggested in comment above, <a href=""https://www.seattlecoffeegear.com/service/tech-tips/descaling-home-espresso-machine"" rel=""nofollow"">descaling</a> or decalcifying your machine may solve your problem. We just run straight distilled white vinegar through ours to do so. Running the machine with distilled water rather than tap water helps keep mineral deposits to a minimum.</p>

<p>Also, running it without water can create an airlock (which makes it take a while for the water to pull through), and allows the pump to spin freely, and so can wreak havoc on, or at least weaken the pump. (I don't know what specific pump is employed by your machine, but <a href=""https://keithspecialty.wordpress.com/2011/04/14/can-i-damage-my-pump-if-i-run-out-of-water/"" rel=""nofollow"">this page</a> may apply.) </p>

<p>Moreover, in the event that the pump has become weakened, it can be helpful to keep the reservoir completely full of water. I do not believe that a normally working machine would be affected too much by the grinding coarseness selected. </p>

<p>Edited to add: While commercial descaling/decalcifying solutions are available (and might work really well) for this application, the staff on a <a href=""https://www.seattlecoffeegear.com/full-circle-single-cup-cleaning-descaling-liquid"" rel=""nofollow"">website</a> selling such reports in the Q&amp;A, ""Breville actually recommends using vinegar to descale their machines while you're under their warranty."" </p>

<p>When deciding what to use, it may be to one's advantage to research whether the product is under warranty, and what the specific manufacturer recommends.

"Why is it not recommended to drink coffee immediately after it's roasted?","20483","","<p>The rule of thumb is that you first drink coffee approximately 3 days after it is roasted, but what is the exact reason for this?</p>
","<p>Fresh off the roast, coffee has high levels of carbon dioxide and nitrogen (based?) gasses. These gasses will greatly contribute to <em>retro-nasal activity</em> as well as initial flavors (think carbonated water). The most apparent flavor one gets from this is <em>metallic</em>. At my work, 4 days is considered minimum for serving and tasting, although there's always exceptions. </p>

"What is the basic differences between espresso, cappuccino, and latte?","18714","","<p>I'm just getting into the coffee world, and I'm assaulted with words such as latte, espresso, etc. What are the basic differences between coffee preparations like espresso, cappuccino, and latte? Is the difference a matter of coffee-to-milk ratio or are there other aspects involved such as bitterness, acidity, caffeine amount, and serving size?</p>
","<p>I am answering here as it applies to Italy, elsewhere it can be different.</p>

<p>Cappuccino in Italian means little cappuccio, which in turn means little cap.
It is a milk-and-coffee drink with a peculiar topping:  a milk foam obtained with steam. You might ask to add also some chocolate powder. Apart from the taste, the powder filling the foam pore gives a pleasant look to the drink. When travelling abroad, I see this as a standard feature, but here it is on request.</p>

<p>The steam is produced from a pump part of quite a large coffee machine, which is the  standard equipment of any  Italian bar. Because of the high pressure involved it is normally not possible to produce a cappuccino at home, at least not using a standard stove. Anyway nowadays they are selling cut down versions of the bar machine, which can produce bar-like cappuccinos (and coffee) even at home. </p>

<p>Temperature is crucial for cappuccino. Hot temperature is necessary to produce the foam, but a too hot cappuccino will hurt your tongue. Contrary to a hot cup of tea, where you can wait for it to become  colder, here when the hot goes away also the foam does, so what you drink is not a cappuccino anymore.</p>

<p>Espresso means express, as you might guess. It is a coffee made with the big machine I mentioned above.
Contrary to the coffee made at home on the stove, with the so called moka machine, this machine can make a good coffee instantly. That anyway requires this appliance to be already setup (with proper pressure and temperature levels), which takes time but it is done only once, in the morning, when the bar opens. it might help observing that breakfast is almost inexistent in Italy, as it consists for many of a fast and frugal espresso  or cappuccino with a croissant, taken  standing still at the bar before commuting  to you workplace. So speed in brewing pays.</p>

<p>Besides Italian approach to coffee as a drink is radically different. For what I have seen, in the rest of the world the coffee is drunk in mugs similar to those used for the tea (I am thinking to American coffee for example); here  the size of a coffee cup is extremely small and  this is because the drink is concentrated. To brew the coffee like  this you need water at  high pressure and  high temperature forced  through a  tier of coffee by the coffee machine. </p>

<p>Big espresso machines found in bars are ideal, given their power, to obtain this and generally their output is considered better than moka coffee made at home.</p>

<p>Note that contrary to cappuccino, here the higher the temperature the better the taste. To make it drinkable bars use special cups very thick. The final results is that you don't hurt your lips when you drink, also the volume of liquid  going through your mouth is less, and you don't burn your tongue.</p>

<p>I have read that the total caffeine in an American coffee is higher, anyway the sensation that you have with an espresso is like you are taking something stronger and we even amplify this effect by drinking it fast, often in one shot.</p>

<p>Given the high temperature and pressure, if one does not make the espresso daily, it is very easy to make it  <em>burned</em>, producing something that is  bitter and distasteful. I have seen many  used  to American coffee (big cups), disliking espresso and vice versa. 
Anyway, before deciding that the strong taste of espresso is not for you, make sure you have tasted a professionally  made one.</p>

<p>As I said before, there are now home espresso machines, which are also easy to operate. </p>

<p>Latte is short for latte macchiato, stained milk. The stain is the a little quantity of coffee.</p>

<p>Strange as it may seem, in Italy the word espresso is a sort of foreigner word not used at all. Perhaps it was in 1800, when the espresso was invented, but now we just say: ""A coffee, please"".   </p>

A day? A week? If the milk is the limiting factor, could I make a batch of espresso, chill that, and add milk as and when to get the same drink, or would it taste different if prepared this way?</p>
","<p>When I worked in a coffee shop and we prepared a beverage similar to an iced latte, we always mixed the milk in with the chilled espresso. Keep in mind this was a beverage prepared ahead of time and not server to the client right away.</p>

<p>We <strong>NEVER</strong> added dairy to espresso and then chilled it for later.  It has been shown that 1 liter of milk can develop harmful bacteria after being in a room temperature space for as little as half an hour.</p>

<p>I would highly recommend that you <strong>do not</strong> prepare your iced lattes completely with milk and then chill them.</p>

<p>I recommend making the espresso, adding whatever sugar or flavor you want while it is still hot, chilling it in the fridge, and then adding milk to the espresso once it has been chilled or when you are looking to drink it. <strong>This will keep for a maximum of 48 hours.</strong></p>

<p>As with all coffee, the fresher the better, but if you are indeed looking for a quick way to grab an iced latte, I would do so in the manner I described.</p>

"Did people actually drink coffee off the saucer?","15813","","<p><a href=""http://en.ilovecoffee.jp/posts/view/83"">This website</a> has a claim that seems somewhat ludicrous nowadays. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""[People] used to pour coffee into the saucer to cool it off, and slurped it off the saucer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seems laughably silly by modern standards - enough so to make me question its veracity.</p>

<p>Did people actually do this in the 18th century? If so, why? We drink coffee out of cups now - what changed?</p>
","<p>In fact, it seems that people would drink both from the cup <em>and</em> from the saucer: After being served a hot beverage (e.g., coffee or tea) in a cup on top of a saucer, some would pour a small amount of the beverage onto the saucer, and then drink from the saucer. There's evidence that this was reasonably common into the 20th century, and evidence that some still do, for a variety of possible reasons! Though I've never seen this practice in person, the following is what I have aggregated from a bit of online searching.</p>

<p>A <a href=""http://organon.jimhufford.com/2010/03/things-ive-always-wondered-about-cooling-saucer-edition/"">blog post</a> contains some good links about the topic. I find the most compelling of them to be an article that discusses <a href=""http://www.americancenturies.mass.edu/classroom/curriculum_12th/unit3/lesson8/bkgdessay.html"">the use of <em>deep</em> saucers</a> for this practice; the saucer is larger and deeper like a shallow bowl, alleviating some of the awkward logistical aspects of drinking from a flat or shallow saucer. Another anecdote, <a href=""http://www.senate.gov/legislative/common/briefing/Senate_legislative_process.htm"">according to US government legend</a>, George Washington (in a discussion with Thomas Jefferson) used the literal practice (cooling-off beverages in a saucer) as a metaphor for the cooling-off that occurs in the upper house of a bicameral legislature. Even if this exact exchange is embellished, it still suggests that the practice was common enough to be in the vernacular.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, pouring part of a hot beverage into a saucer would help cool it down faster. Many anecdotal sources have that as an assumed motivation; if you're in a hurry to start drinking your beverage (and are a bit careful about the pouring and the saucer-sipping) it's a practical way of doing so. Some other anecdotes suggest that it was fashionable or polite (maybe even fun?) -- perhaps like <a href=""http://resources.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/customs/behaviourfood.html"">eating peas off the back of one's fork</a>. Cooling a portion in the saucer would alleviate the need for potentially-impolite-seeming slurping or blowing across the beverage to cool it, substituting instead acrobatic-prowess-demonstrating yet possibly-more-polite sipping off of a saucer.  Other discussion forums (<a href=""http://aforum.genealogi.se/discus/messages/2450/91396.html?1269309231"">one example</a>) contain some additional anecdotes and pictures.</p>

"What are these spots on the inside of my moka pot? Do I need to remove them?","13793","","<p>I've got these spots on the inside the bottom section of my Bialetti Moka Express:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y21rR.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y21rR.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>They are placed pretty evenly around the ridgy part toward the edge of the bottom of the circle, with a few toward the middle. They are only on the bottom of the pot as far as I can tell, not the sides. They look sort of like black mold, but I gave the pot a gentle scrub with warm water and a mild soap and they didn't budge.</p>

<p>I don't normally use soap on my pot. Generally I make a cup of coffee, rinse all components, and allow them to air dry. Sometimes when I'm pressed for time, the just-used pot sits in the sink for a few hours without getting disassembled or rinsed. I have a hunch that that moisture may be contributing here. I use filtered water, so I don't think they are mineral deposits (unlike in <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1847/moka-pot-buildup"">this case</a>). The pot is pretty new. It's been used 1-3 times per day for about three weeks.</p>

<p>So what are these spots? If they aren't affecting the flavor of the result, do I need to worry about them? If so, how can they be removed?</p>
","<p>Short story: <strong>They are probably aluminum oxide</strong>, but almost certainly some kind of metal oxide. <strong>You don't need to take any action unless they're affecting the taste of your coffee</strong>, and it shouldn't be. You probably <em>can't</em> (or <em>shouldn't</em>) really permanently remove them even if you wanted to.</p>

<p>Longer story...</p>

<p>This is a <a href=""http://www.bialetti.com/coffee/stovetop/moka-express-c-1_7_22.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">classic Bialetti</a> model, and a classic Bialetti symptom. The vessel is probably made out of alumin[i]um alloy (though there are similar models that are made of stainless steel, your picture seems to be looking down into the bottom heating vessel, and it looks like the classic aluminum species). Unfortunately the symptoms you're seeing, from my perspective, is a classic <em>failure</em> of the Bialetti design. Aluminum tarnishes (oxidizes) somewhat readily, especially when it is hot and in contact with water. Correspondingly, the only way to use this thing is, indeed, to heat it with water.</p>

<p><strong>The vessel, especially, needs to be rinsed and <em>dried thoroughly</em> in The Right Way.</strong> The <a href=""http://www.bialetti.com/coffee/stovetop/moka-express-c-1_7_22.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""care"" page for Bialetti</a> (follow that link, then click on the ""Care Use"" tab; I can't figure a direct link) suggests to <em>dry thoroughly</em> and most tellingly ""Do not reassemble the product until all parts are completely dry to avoid oxidation."" Even if you're meticulously drying the thing, it's still going to be a little hot and a little damp; this is going to invite oxidation. </p>

<p>Standard ways of removing tarnish are even more damaging in the long term than just leaving them alone. Aluminum oxide generally protects the metal from further oxidation (unlike rust -- iron oxide -- which flakes off and <em>facilitates</em> further oxidation).</p>

<p>I have a stainless steel moka pot, and it's terribly tarnished on the outside from heating on a gas burner hundreds of times, but the inside is clean (and clean<em>able</em>) as the metaphorical ""whistle"".</p>

<p>For completeness: It's also possible that they are mineral deposits; <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/1849"">this answer</a> to the other question that you linked has some additional info about that possibility. It would come from a buildup (""scale"") from using ""hard"" water, and more so when nearly boiling dry (also not a good idea); filtered or distilled water is much less likely to do this. However, I think it's unlikely that you'd see scale buildup over the span of a couple dozen uses.</p>

"What's the most effective way of generating crema from an Aeropress?","12644","","<p>I know a number of people have become fairly capable at getting a nice amount of crema at the end of the process of making a cup with their Aeropress.</p>

<p>I, however, am getting just a very thin, partial layer at best. I've experimented with pressure, and somewhat with water temperature.</p>

<p>Wondering if there's a magic bullet, or a good list of bullet points of things to do to maximize crema?</p>
","<p>Here's a quick rundown of the Aeropress method I use every morning. I end up with a relatively crema-y shot. You'd never mistake it for one from an espresso machine, but there's a good layer all across the top. </p>

<p>This is completely unscientific and I can't identify which steps here are the relevant ones for the good results, but maybe if you experiment with some of these adjustments you can identify what works and what doesn't. </p>

<h2>The Equipment</h2>

<ul>
<li>Aeropress</li>
<li>Scoop that came with the Aeropress</li>
<li><a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00A1GVVMY"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ultra fine mesh filter</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>The Coffee</h2>

<p>The beans I use vary; I generally grab a light or medium roast off the shelves at Trader Joes and grind it one click down from the finest setting on the in-store grinder. (The finest setting purports to be for Turkish coffee; the one I use is labeled 'espresso'.) </p>

<p>I store the ground coffee in its can in the fridge for up to a week or a week and a half, depending on how long it takes me to drink it all. Today I'm using Trader Joe's <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00GK5R8IG"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee</a>, a delightful medium roast. (I just now learned that Serious Eats says <a href=""http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2014/01/worst-and-best-coffee-at-trader-joes-which-coffee-to-buy-tj.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">it's the best bet</a> for Trader Joe's coffee.)</p>

<h2>The Water</h2>

<p>Melted snow from the Wasatch Mountains, filtered through whatever the county of Salt Lake does before it gets to my kitchen tap, and heated on the stove until just before the boil. There are tiny bubbles forming on the bottom of the kettle, but few of them are rising to the surface of the water.</p>

<h2>The Method</h2>

<p>I'm pretty loosey-goosey about my brewing method, but the results are very consistent. This leads me to believe it's the equipment and the beans that are generating the great results, not anything I'm doing right.</p>

<ol>
<li>Set up the Aeropress for <a href=""http://ineedcoffee.com/upside-aeropress-coffee-brewing-tutorial/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">inverted brewing</a>.</li>
<li>For one shot, use a generous scoop of ground coffee. Tap the assembly on the counter so the mound of coffee flattens out.</li>
<li>Slowly add your just-off-the-boil water. (I use a <a href=""http://districtbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Hario-Buono-Kettle.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">gooseneck kettle</a> for easy, controlled pouring.) Rotate the Aeropress as you pour and do so until you can no longer see any dry grounds. (The chamber should be about 2/3 full when this is complete.)</li>
<li>Stir slowly until you get that lovely uniform light brown color on the top of the mixture. I use the handle of the scoop for stirring.</li>
<li>Place the cap and filter on top of the assembly and wait 15-60 seconds. (My own brewing time varies wildly, depending on what distracts me during that time.)</li>
<li>Press. With this fine grind and filter, you'll have to press a little harder than with the coarser grind. As you press you'll see foamy buildup gather on top of the grounds. You'll have to press extra hard at the end to squeeze all of that through, but it will drip down onto your shot at the end and form that delightful crema.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Edit:</h3>

<p>As I pay more attention each morning, I've noticed a couple more things:</p>

<ul>
<li>My results vary significantly. I <em>think</em> the contributing factors are the grind and how hard I press at the end.</li>
<li>I never use soap on my Aeropress equipment. I rinse it with tap water after each use, but never run it through the dishwasher. There may be buildup of coffee oils on the surfaces that helps (or hinders??) the foam making process.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Edit Redux:</h3>

<p>For the past few weeks I've been casually experimenting with my morning coffee and coming up with very inconclusive results. (As I <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/58/whats-the-most-effective-way-of-generating-crema-from-an-aeropress/165#comment772_165"">mentioned below</a>, all I've come up with are a bunch of totally surefire ways to absolutely demolish the crema, and no methods of preserving it.)</p>

<p>This half-butted casual science ends now! I just bought a hand grinder and <a href=""http://aeropresstimer.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">an app full of AeroPress recipes</a>; thusly armed, I'm going to experiment more formally. Well, a little more formally. I'll track the results <a href=""https://docs.google.com/a/stackoverflow.com/spreadsheets/d/1tKJx-io7Zk71vrcn0SBcCHRxw2ui5UGpmDaPtViXXec/edit#gid=0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> and update this answer when and if I come up with a reliable way to generate and preserve the foam on my AeroPress shots.</p>

<h3>Edit The Third:</h3>

<p><a href=""https://docs.google.com/a/stackoverflow.com/spreadsheets/d/1tKJx-io7Zk71vrcn0SBcCHRxw2ui5UGpmDaPtViXXec/edit#gid=0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The results are in</a>: I've figured out how to stop killing my crema. It turns out that the combination of <strong>freshly ground beans</strong> and <strong>the mesh metal filter</strong> is somehow stopping the crema from getting through to the cup. Eight attempts with hand-ground beans failed miserably, and my first attempt after reverting to store-ground beans (with the 'somewhat loosey-goosey' method above) generated a nice layer of foam in the cup.</p>

<p>However, the plot thickens. My <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/users/137/robert-cartaino"">colleague Robert</a> asserts:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Never had a problem getting crema with aeropress. Lots of fresh coffee ground to a powder, very little very hot water. Makes my ubercoffee syrup shots I talked about a year or more ago... with plenty o crema. Dilute to taste (which I never did &lt; jitter >).</p>
  
  <p>...and I'm not entirely sure, but if memory serves, switching to the fine metal mesh filter meant bye-bye to crema. It's been a bit too long to remember for certain. I just reused the same paper filter over and over for months (actually, I used two to keep them from blowing out).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it would seem that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Freshly, very finely ground coffee + paper filter + not much water = crema city</li>
<li>Coffee ground fine in the store + metal filter + water = crema town</li>
</ul>

<p>I'd be interested to see others' results from experiments like these.</p>

<li><p>The machine seriously needs to be de-scaled. I would recommend running a solution of 25% lemon juice and 75% water through the machine.

"What coffees are the least acidic?","11347","","<p>I don't like coffees with an acidic/sour taste. However, when buying coffee, the only ""rating"" one gets is often how ""strong"" the coffee is, and that does not help me. Is there something else I can go on? Say, place of origin, or certain varieties that aren't acidic in taste?</p>
","<p><strong>Lets answer this question with some data!</strong> My company uses machine learning, data science, and sensory science to build flavor profiling and quality control tools for the craft beverage industry. </p>

<p>I will use a lot of graphs, because a picture is worth a thousand words but a graph can communicate a concept, to dispel a lot of the myths about acidity in coffee. </p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Roast level is the Primary determinant of sour and acidity in coffee, where lighter roast has more natural acid compounds left unbroken from maillard reaction and strecker degradation (non-enzymatic browning).  This is closely followed by Altitude, green processing, and finally age of the coffee.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Differences by Region</h2>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5FChz.png"" alt=""Sour &amp; Acidity in coffee by Country""></p>

<p>Based on 10,000+ reviews, their seems to be little indication that you can determine the sourness or acidity of a coffee simply by where its grown! </p>

<p>Now, this lack of effect would disappear if we controlled for the altitude the coffee was grown at. Why? Because higher altitude plants are under more stress, forcing them to be more efficient - less leafs, less fruit, but each leaf has a higher respiratory rate, and each fruit is more potent! </p>

<hr>

<h2>Green Processing</h2>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UE9Xa.png"" alt=""Distribution of Sour and Acidity by Green Processing""></p>

<p>This graph shows the difference in distribution of Sour &amp; Acidity of washed coffee vs natural processed coffee. There is a very small difference in the skew and kurtosis, but it is statistically significant. </p>

<p>Washed Coffee brewed in a Chemex is on average more acidic than its natural washed counterpart. Why? This is most likely a cognitive, not chemical, effect. Because natural processed coffees ferment with bits of remnant fruit (the coffee cherry) they retain more sugars, some of which are preserved though the roasting process. The increase in fruity esters and sugar compounds masks the acidity - so even though there's about equal amounts, you taste it less in the natural processed coffees. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Age of the Coffee</h2>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gn6eJ.png"" alt=""Acid Degradation over Time""></p>

<p>If you really want to avoid any acidity in coffee, you could drink it stale! But I don't suggest it - stale coffee lacks the caffeine and interesting flavors that make coffee wonderful. </p>

<p>This plot shows the rate of acid degradation in coffee from its first day since roast. The red line marks the 14th day from roast, when the average coffee goes stale. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Level of Roast</h2>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uajzo.png"" alt=""Acidity VS Level of Roast""></p>

<p>This graph shows Sour and Acidity as a function of the level of roast; as roast increases, the average perception of acidity decreases (in coffee brewed in a chemex). The grey field shows the Standard Error within the fit. </p>

<p>You should note, why is the error so high at the highest level of roast? These are coffees considered ""French"" or ""Italian"" or even ""Spanish"" roasts - you should consider these coffees burnt. The fruity and interesting acids such as malic, phosphoric, and citric have been destroyed by prolonged heat exposure in the roaster, <strike>and these coffees contain acrylamide, a carcinogen, which is not only bad for you, but also tastes terrible.</strike> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The levels of acrylamide, a known carcinogen, peak early in the
  roasting process (at about 120 sec).  While acrylamide is still
  detectable in fully roasted and burnt coffees, it most likely don’t
  contribute to the unpleasant, burnt flavor in over-roasted coffee. 
  Multiple studies suggest that the main chemicals that cause bad
  flavors in burnt coffee are heterocyclic aromatic amines and
  polyaromatic hydrocarbons.  These increase with roasting temperature
  and time and many compounds that fall into these categories are known
  or suspected carcinogens.</p>

<p>A major coffee chain, seen on almost every other corner in some places, is known for their very dark, ""burnt"" roast. Many people like this sharp taste and associate it with caffeine and their morning pick-me up.</p>

<p>Other people find this ""burnt"" roast to be overwhelming and consider this heavy roast to be destructive when using high-quality beans. In any case the burning happens at roast - not when brewing.</p>

"Does using two paper filters in a drip machine strengthen flavour?","8719","","<p>From time to time, I find myself somewhere, where I have to make coffee using a drip machine. Often it is one that takes flat-bottom, paper filters.</p>

<p>When I am in this situation, I am usually working with a weak coffee. To strengthen the taste of the coffee, I reason that using two paper filters instead of one will increase the extraction time of the coffee (which I prefer in this setting).</p>

<p><strong>My question:</strong></p>

<p>Will using two paper filters actually have a significant change on coffee extraction time? Or is the difference insignificant? </p>
","<p>Yes, because it allows more time for coffee to be extracted as it stored in a longer time for coffee to drip. However, other parameters also have effect regarding this issue (such as, type of bean, roasting profile, temperature, brewing method)
But using double filter since it also filter the ""flavor"", making it stale (you may lose the pleasant acidic, fruity flavor, or other unique flavor your bean may offered) and double filter can make your coffee over extracted thus unpleasant bitter flavor. 
If you want your coffee strong you may want other experiment</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Use fresh coffee bean</strong>
the older the coffee, they tend to lose their flavor. The fresher, the better. You have to store your bean properly too, keep it in air-tight container, avoid direct sunlight</li>
<li><strong>wait  to grind your bean, until the last minute</strong> coffee lose a bit of its flavor after grinding. Ground coffee is also more sensitive to the moisture</li>
<li><p><strong>Use different kind of bean</strong> You may use robusta, it naturally has more ""caffeine"" compared to Arabica, therefore can ""hit"" you harder</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use different kind of roasting profile</strong> the darker the roast, the bitter it is, but it has less caffeine.</p></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>when brewing</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Pre-warming the equipment or insulating it</strong> basically the hotter the temperature you get bitter flavor, to avoid the ""upleasant bitter"" you may adjust the water temperature according to your preferences. Temperature loss often occurs as a result of heat absorption by the equipment itself (and therefore stale flavor), so pre-heat the equipment would prevent it</li>
<li><strong>Use finer grind</strong> Coarser grind can make your coffee under extracted</li>
<li><strong>Adjust the amount of your coffee</strong></li>
<li><strong>Adjust the steeping time</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>In the end it comes down to your preference(s). No single technique is right for everyone. Enjoy your coffee immediately after brewing</p>

<p>My explanation might not answer your question directly, double filter affect your coffee, yes it is. But other factors simply can be neglected</p>

"Why is my drip-coffee machine making watery coffee lately?","8102","","<p>Lately, coffee from my very basic Mr. Coffee 5-cup drip brewer has been watery tasting, and I am hoping for some troubleshooting help.</p>

<p>I recently purchased of a Cuisinart DBM-8 (a basic automatic grinder) to replace an even more basic blade grinder. This grinder has allows for a grind amounts in increments of ""2 coffee cups"" starting from 4 cups.</p>

<p>My coffee did not become watery upon first use of the DBM-8. I usually brew using 16 to 20 fluid oz of water, and I have switched between the 4-cup and the 6-cup setting on the grinder. I found that the 6-cup setting tasted pretty good, but seemed to use up a lot of beans.</p>

<p>With all that said, what has happened for the past week is that coffee made using my brewer has been tasting watery, no matter if I use the 4-cup or the 6-cup grind setting, and whether I try more or less water. I have set the coarseness of the grind to medium, which I believe is appropriate. All I am getting is colored hot water.</p>

<p>When I inspect the coffee filter and the grounds after brewing with the 6-cup grind, I observe a portion of the coffee grounds appear dry on top, although beneath that, the coffee grounds appear wet. It's as if the hot water is going directly through the filter without soaking enough in the grounds.</p>

<p>Is my coffee maker broken? I tried cleaning with diluted vinegar, but this did not change things.</p>

<p>Is it the beans? I do switch around, but the beans I buy are in the 10-20$ range per pound. I keep the beans in the closed hopper of the grinder.</p>
","<p>Well this is a strange problem but it seems to have to do with the new grinder you are using or the way you use it since the grind is the only variable that has changed (according to your story).</p>

<p>Watery coffee most often means that you don't use enough ground coffee. Try using 6g of coffee per 100ml of water for a medium roast. If the roast is very light you may use a slightly higher coffee to water ratio. If it is not the quantity of coffee it is probably the grinder setting. Try a finer grind, something between table salt and sand (probably just the medium-fine setting on your grinder, however do check with your fingers). The problem may be what was suggested in the comments. If the grind is too coarse, the water is just running through the coffee and doesn't leave the time to spread and steep. This is in line with the hole in the center of the coffee bed you are describing. Maybe try to measure the time the coffee needs to run through and see if it changes if you grind finer.</p>

<p>If this doesn't help then I'd suggest you properly clean the spout and make sure the water is dripping out the way it is supposed to. Maybe scale has built up which is channeling the water, forcing it through the spout in a stream that hits the coffee grounds with too much pressure.</p>

<p>I suggest you try all of the above which will most likely solve your problem. Additionally however you could cut up some standard paper filters and place them on the ground coffee so that it is completely covered. In theory the water should then distribute much more evenly through the grounds. I'd suggest you do this only <strong>after</strong> you have solved the general problem as a means to improve the flavor. It'd definitely be a quite ""hacky"" solution and I think first of all your machine should work the way it is supposed to.</p>

"How to (re-)calibrate an espresso machine and grinder setup?","8042","","<p>When you're starting your shift at your coffee shop and take over the bar from another barista, the machine and grinder can be in varying states of cleanliness and calibration. How do you quickly and correctly get back to pulling good shots from clean equipment?</p>
","<p>This answer addresses a ""standard"" semi-automatic espresso machine with a separate grinder. Specifically the LaMarzocco and Astoria grinder, but the ideas should generalize to other machines of the same class.</p>

<h2>Cleaning</h2>

<p>Of course, wipe down everything and get all pitchers and spoons clean. Blast out all the milk and ""wetness"" from the steam wands. Inspect and clean all portafilters* (get one clean, and then use it while you clean the others), and if necessary backflush the groups with water (with ""bumping"" so you blast water around the seals to get any buildup there clean).</p>

<p>*especially <em>under</em> the basket.</p>

<h2>Calibrating</h2>

<p>The abstract procedure here is described using the Hackers' terms <a href=""https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/frob"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Frob, Twiddle, and Tweak</a>. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6v8sh.png"" alt=""frob quote from Hackers&#39; Dictionary""><br>
<a href=""http://catb.org/esr/jargon/html/F/frob.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://catb.org/esr/jargon/html/F/frob.html</a></p>

<p>To fully calibrate the setup, we'll need to make three passes over all the controls. </p>

<ol>
<li>Frob. In the <em>frob</em> pass, we make just ""coarse"" adjustments to get everything roughly correct. (reinterpreting the hacker usage. This isn't <em>aimless</em>.) </li>
<li>Twiddle. In the <em>twiddle</em> pass, we adjust each parameter up and down a little, in a more ""scientific"" manner: while adjusting any one parameter, the rest are left alone so they behave as ""controls"" for the quick little ""experiments"" to check each change.  </li>
<li>Tweak. In the <em>tweak</em> pass, everything should be mostly correct by now. Just apply any finishing touches.</li>
</ol>

<p>The controls we have available are the <strong>grind</strong>, <strong>dose</strong>, and <strong>water quantity</strong>. Following the David Schomer method, I strongly advise that the tamping pressure should be <em>constant</em>. Always tamp the same way: from the elbow, so you don't stress your wrists.</p>

<p>In the David Schomer method, the dose is controlled by counting ""clicks"" of the doser. You keep the doser compartment as empty as possible, grinding only what you need so everything stays fresh, locked in the bean). Count how many clicks gets you to ""full"", maybe a little heaping. This number is your <em>base</em> dose. Keep it constant for now. And this constitutes the ""frob"" of the dose.</p>

<p>Set the group in programming mode and Pull a shot, setting the water level to yield 2 oz. This is the ""frob"" of the water quantity.</p>

<p>If the extraction time was off, adjust the grind. This the ""frob"" of the grind, so you can make bigger movements if you need to (exercise your judgement), but remember only adjust finer while grinding, so you don't lock the burrs on a tough bean. Pull a few shots until the time is (roughly) correct.</p>

<p>So, we've done our ""frob"" pass. Now ""twiddle."" Adjusting the grind to control the extraction time probably threw off the water quantity a little bit. So do a ""twiddle"" of the water quantity by entering programming mode and pulling a shot. Actually, you shouldn't need to ""twiddle"" per se: there's no *up and down"" here, but I think the terms still represent a useful mnemonic for the general procedure.</p>

<p>Then do a ""twiddle"" of the grind. You want the grind to be as coarse as possible within its ""range"", if you know what I mean. All the grounds in the doser are quickly going stale. A coarser grind yields little pieces of coffee bean that are slightly larger, with a lower surface/volume ratio. Lower surface area means less interaction with the air, and the grounds resist going stale a little better.</p>

<p>There should be no need to ""twiddle"" the dose at this point. We're adjusting the other controls so the dose remains at comfortable spot. </p>

<p>Now, one final pass to ""tweak"". Pull a shot, and examine its quality. Particularly look for the tell-tale white ""overextraction stain"" where the last drips struck the crema. You want to tweak the water quantity to stop <em>just before</em> the color changes. This tweak gives you ""ristretto-quality"" shots.</p>

<h2>Adjusting on-the-fly</h2>

<p>Remember that we did not mess with the dose much in the above steps. But the other parameters were setup so the dose is ""comfortable"". This lets us make small adjustments to the dose in order to ""ride the wave"" of the machine and keep all the shots in the time range. Remember not to brew shots while the boiler is cycling.</p>

<p>The same three adjustments, <strong>frob</strong>, <strong>twiddle</strong>, and <strong>tweak</strong>, apply also to dynamic adjustments. <strong>Frob</strong>, the <em>coarsest</em> control is the water quantity, which should no longer need adjusting at this point. <strong>Twiddle</strong>, the <em>medium-grain</em> control is the grind setting. Unless a freak thundershower rolls-in and totally changes the pressure and humidity of the atmosphere, you should only need to make small adjustments and only to recalibrate the dose to a comfortable level. <strong>Tweak</strong>, the <em>finest</em> control is the dose.</p>

<p>If a shot pulls 1-second too long, <strong>tweak</strong> your dose ever-so-slightly shorter. Either count 1-fewer click, or count your clicks just a hair faster.</p>

<p>If a shot pulls 1-second too short, <strong>tweak</strong> your dose ever-so-slightly longer. Either count 1 more click, or count your clicks just a hair slower.</p>

<p>If the dose gets too low (by visual inspection: exercise your judgement), <strong>twiddle</strong> the grind a little coarser so you can achieve the same <em>density</em> with more <em>mass</em>.</p>

<p>If the dose gets too high (exercise judgement), <strong>twiddle</strong> the grind a little finer so you can achieve the <em>density</em> with less <em>mass</em>. (Volume is constant.)</p>

<hr> 

<p>I actually haven't worked on this machine in almost 10 years. So this is all based on my memory of that one amazing day when I pulled 20sec (+/-1) shots for eight solid hours.</p>

<p>On a different day, I recalibrated after a thunderstorm started by pulling the grinder 8 clicks (!) coarser. And got it back to 20sec after 2 or 3 pairs.</p>

<p>That's how I know. But I learned this all from David Schomer's book.</p>

<h2>Appendix: The ""David Schomer"" method or ""ritual""</h2>

<p>This is what I remember from the amazing book, <em>Espresso Coffee: Professional techniques</em> by David Schomer. And hey Matt, I want my copy back!</p>

<h3>A. <strong>Preheat and Clean.</strong></h3>

<li><p>Wipe the basket and run a splash of water through the group without the portafilter to rinse the upper screen. <em>(You can catch this water with the portafilter before wiping to rinse more of the grounds so your clean towel stays clean longer.)</em></p></li>
</ol>

<h3>B. <strong>Grind and Dose.</strong></h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Turn on grinder to start to fill the doser (which should be as empty as practical).</p></li>
<li><p>Immediately start pulling clicks of the doser until the basket is full, or <em>a little</em> heaping.</p></li>
<li><p>Turn off grinder.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>C. <strong>Distribute and Tamp.</strong></h3>

<ol>
<li><p>With clean hands, distribute the grounds evenly with a finger (I use my ring finger, but whatever works).</p></li>
<li><p>Tamp lightly to shape the puck.</p></li>
<li><p>Tap the edge with the handle end of your nice aluminum tamper that you bought yourself and brought to work to help. This gets the little bit of coffee around the edge that the tamper missed.</p></li>
<li><p>Tamp firmly, from the elbow. About 30 pounds of pressure.</p></li>
<li><p>Reinsert the portafiler.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>D. <strong>Brew.</strong></h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Click the button to start brewing. </p></li>
<li><p>Immediately discard the hot water from the shot glasses which is still there from step A.1.</p></li>
<li><p>Watch the pour and stop it early if you need to, to catch the <em>sweet spot</em>.</p></li>

"What is the science (if any) behind bulletproof coffee?","7904","","<p>Over the past few years I've been slowly starting to dabble in the caffeinated arts.  I'm far from being knowledgeable, but I'm definitely very curious about this favourite beverage of mine.  So, I occasionally read up on it.</p>

<p>Not long ago I discovered something called <strong>Bulletproof Coffee</strong>.  It seems to be associated with the Paleo diet movement.  It involves adding butter to your coffee.</p>

<p>I asked around at a few coffee shops but nobody seems to know why anyone would do this!</p>

<p>Articles such as <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2014/nov/25/bulletproof-coffee-is-adding-butter-to-your-morning-coffee-a-step-too-far"">this</a> one claim it gives an energy boost.</p>

<p>Is this true?  If so, what is the science behind this?</p>
","<p>Another view on this:</p>

<p>Bulletproof coffee is often used with a low-carb diet, often referred to as the ""keto diet"", which has some similarities with Paleo, but is quite different. The diet requires you to cut out as many carbohydrates as possible out of your diet in order to get your body into a state of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketosis"" rel=""nofollow"">ketosis</a>, where most of the energy in the body is produced by processing fat instead of carbohydrates.</p>

<p>When following the keto diet, you need to eat a lot of fat, minimum carbohydrates and a reasonable amount of protein. The goal is to get most of your calories from fat. Getting in all the fat that is required is often difficult, so in that context, bulletproof coffee is nothing more than a delivery method for fat. There's nothing special about it, it's just easier to drink a spoonful of butter melted in coffee than eating it on its own.</p>

"Is it possible to feel any effects after chewing one coffee bean?","7752","","<p>The question title says it all: My colleague wanted to try my coffee, so he grabbed one bean of coffee (roasted) and chewed it up.</p>

<p>After several minutes, he claims, that it has positive effects on him (feels ""juiced up)</p>

<p>Obviously, I am wondering now: Is it just placebo effect, or is there any possibility to feel this after chewing up only one bean?</p>
","<p>First I want to draw a comparison between how much caffeine is in a coffee bean versus a cup of coffee, a cup of tea, or a double espresso.</p>

<p>In a standard cup of coffee, there is approximately 150 mg of caffeine. In a cup of black tea, steeped for 3 - 5 minutes there is approximately 50 mg of caffeine. In a double espresso there is approximately 60 - 90 mg of caffeine depending on the roast, grind, extraction time, etc.</p>

<p>In one dark roasted espresso bean there is approximately 6 mg of caffeine according to <a href=""http://www.caffeineinformer.com/caffeine-content/coffee-beans"">this source.</a></p>

<p>If a person is <strong>extremely sensitive</strong> to caffeine, they would probably be able to feel the effect of 6 mg of caffeine. However, if someone is a coffee drinker, the likelihood that this caffeine is actually affecting them is <strong>very</strong> unlikely.</p>

<p>If your friend never ingests soda, coffee, tea, or caffeine in any form then he <strong>may</strong> have felt some of the effects. In my opinion, the majority of the way your colleague was feeling was probably a placebo effect.</p>

<ul>
<li>How does its taste differ from more traditionally processed coffee from the same region?</li>
<li>Are there other coffees with similar tasting notes?</li>
</ul>

<p>I am aware that such a question may be considered opinion-based, but using some sort of external reference, or analysis of its traits, it could receive a more objective answer.</p>
","<p>I've had this <em>on the farm where it was harvested</em>, and was able to verify for myself that wild, happy civets were left to their own selection process and merely followed around by farmers eager to find the drops.</p>

<p>It's not unlike any other Arabica bean. What I had was single-source, but that's rarer - farms doing it <em>correctly</em> don't produce a lot, so packagers and marketers will usually buy from dozens. That brings me to the first thing that determines the taste of it:</p>

<h3>The Roast</h3>

<p>Some farmers roast themselves, others just sell the beans. Many sell directly to people <em>and</em> to packagers, so unless you get it single-source, you're probably going to have a bag of beans roasted anywhere from blonde to nearly dark. If you're serious about tasting it, find a place that offers single-source, or roasts their own. You want it <em>just at</em> the second 'crack'. A comparable color is a Starbucks 'blonde' roast, or the usual color of illy in the red can.</p>

<h3>The Brew</h3>

<p>I've had it two ways, as espresso and in a press. I <em>prefer</em> to have it in a press, despite not getting nearly as much crema. A coarse grind, hot clean water and about 4 minutes to brew. <strong><em>Drink it immediately with a clean palette</em></strong>. Make sure you're not thirsty, make sure you're not hungry, and make sure there's nothing going on with your taste buds other than the coffee. You want to sip slow and enjoy it. Don't let it get cold, but slow down.</p>

<h3>The Taste</h3>

<p>While debates are quite hot regarding whether or not the civet's digestion of the bean adds anything to flavor, I'm quite confident that the selection process <em>does</em>. Good Arabica coffee is known for the subtle nutty / caramel hints, and you know it when you drink this. I couldn't detect any difference in acidity, but the flavors that the bean is known are definitely more present than usual. This makes a lot of sense given the selection process, civets are <em>very</em> picky cats.</p>

<p>But, that's not to say that a very discriminating and trained picker couldn't get you something close. In fact, illy (red) comes <em>very</em> close to the same quality and presence of flavor undertones that I've experienced with alamid (kopi luwak).</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Don't raise your expectations <em>too</em> high, it's not really <em>that</em> much better than any other very high quality Arabica. You're paying for the process (make sure you're dealing with an 'honest' source) as much as you are the quality of bean, novelty and experience.</p>

<p>It tastes very good, but so do the illy beans I grind every day. </p>

"Advantages and disadvantages of French press","6689","","<p>Asking around, I've noticed that public opinion about the french press is rather mixed. I've heard people shun it and others praise it. I have never actually seen a decent explanation why though.</p>

<p>As for advantages, I can tell that it's obviously pretty simple to use. Only hot water and ground coffee is required to operate it, but I'm sure that this process of making a cup of coffee must have some effect on the taste.</p>

<p>What effect does this have then, does this change the bitterness, dilute the taste? Is the pour-over method superior?</p>
","<p>It depends on the press. I personally use a double-walled (which means air-insulated) press with very very fine screens in the plunger. This means my coffee stays hot for quite some time, and I don't commonly have issues with grounds at the bottom of the second cup (it's a 2-cup press). </p>

<p>I also spent over $300 for it, hand made in Japan by expert crafters with some beautiful stainless steel hardware framing it. It's actually <em>guaranteed</em> to resonate at a certain frequency if you wet your finger and run it around the rim. I digress. </p>

<p>Most presses can have some or all of the following issues:</p>

<ul>
<li>Grinds leak through the screen on the plunger quite easily, even with a good coarse grind</li>
<li>Coffee can fall below serving temp before you plunge it if you're not careful</li>
<li>They are a bit of a pain to clean, most can't go <em>near</em> a dishwasher</li>
<li>They tend to be rather fragile</li>
<li>They can stain with certain kinds of water, depending on the glass used</li>
<li>Some argue that the taste of a coarse grind is inferior to finer grinds (a matter of taste is difficult to document)</li>
</ul>

<p>The actual mechanics of making the coffee is very simple. Mix the grinds and water, then using a screen, separate the grinds from the water. The taste is going to depend more on how clean the press is, the quality and temperature of the water, the quality of the bean, grind, how long you let it brew, etc. The same holds true for pour-over brews, provided that the filter is decent and doesn't add its own taste.</p>

<p>I personally prefer my press, but it's really a matter of preference. I don't mind cleaning it, in fact one of the reasons I went with a press a while back was in hopes that the prospect <em>of</em> needing to clean it would slow down my consumption. Didn't work.  I love the consistently-good brews I get out of mine, and I love that it keeps my second cup hot long enough for me to enjoy the first.</p>

<p>Some people <em>do</em> mind the quirks, and prefer not to use them. Something decent usually starts at around $40, so they're not prohibitively expensive for experimentation. All I can say is try both and see what you think.</p>

"Why does coffee taste better out of ceramic cups compared to a paper cup?","6555","","<p>I usually drink double espressos and they always seem to taste much better out of a ceramic cup compared to take-away paper cups. I ordered 2 back to back from the same shop within half an hour yesterday, one in a ceramic cup and one to go (I have a coffee drinking problem...) and the difference was still there - so same barista, machine, beans etc. Why is this? For sushi you are told not to eat it with a metal fork since it will supposedly taint the taste, so could this be similar?</p>
","<p>Both <strong>cup material</strong> and <strong>temperature</strong> are in play here, I think.</p>

<p>A big part of the coffee taste (and experience as a whole) is the aroma. I personally find that <strong>paper cups (not surprisingly) <em>smell and taste like paper</em></strong>. Ceramic (or glass, porcelain, etc.) should be practically neutral. Any smell you get from the cup could affect the perception of taste of the contained beverage. If the cup has a plastic lid, that could contribute both to its own smell, or holding-in / reducing the coffee aroma that you smell, also. (Aside: there are some interesting links to the physiology of smell and taste interplay at the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste"">Wikipedia article on taste</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>The very experience of drinking from a paper cup versus a ceramic cup is different</strong>; heft, shape, handle, other aesthetics, etc., though this probably reduces to personal preference.  For example, I find sometimes that my lip sticks to the outside of the paper cup, which is unpleasant (to me, anyway :). A plastic lid could be a factor here as well.</p>

<p>Temperature may also be a factor. For example, <a href=""http://www.foodnavigator.com/Science/Food-temperature-affects-taste-reveal-scientists"">temperature can affect the perception of bitterness</a>. A properly pre-heated ceramic cup/demitasse will help the brewed coffee be at a consistent temperature (without shocking it after pull) and keep it warmer for longer (so it doesn't cool down too quickly). Such temperature changes could result in a difference in taste; <strong>keeping brewed coffee at a consistent temperature is recommended</strong> -- <a href=""http://www.thecoffeefaq.com/1thebasics.html"">that and some other general properties are listed here</a>. Temperature stability of the brew will probably be different between paper and ceramic.</p>

"Aeropress metal filters, are they worth it?","6288","","<p>I was wondering (other than the long term saving of not having to buy paper filters), what are the advantages of using a metal filter such as <a href=""http://www.hasbean.co.uk/products/able-disk"">this</a>?</p>

<p>In the copy is states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fuller body cup of coffee</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>But is this something the average Joe would notice or is it marketing spiel?</strong></p>

<p>My main thought would be you would get less of a papery taste, but after rinsing the filter, I can;t say that I've ever noticed the taste of paper from a filter (maybe if I had did an A/B test between the 2 I would?).</p>

<p><strong>Would like to hear any thoughts from people that have one?</strong></p>
","<p>I have used both the paper filters and the ""Able"" brand metal AeroPress disk that you linked. They are a bit different, and I use both the metal disk and paper filter based on my mood. To my taste, <strong>the metal disk does produce a ""fuller"" bodied cup</strong> (because more ""stuff"" comes through the filter -- oils and macro-particles or whatever). I believe that ""an average user"" (by my definition) would be able to tell the difference in a side-by-side test, and probably enough to determine preference.</p>

<p>That said, <strong><em>I prefer the paper for a few reasons</em></strong>.</p>

<p>First, the <strong><em>simple convenience</em></strong> is better for me. After brewing, I plunge the filter and spent grounds directly into my compost container. After a quick rinse of the unit, it's clean enough for me.</p>

<p>As for my (personal) taste and preferences, <strong><em>I think the paper produces a better quality and more enjoyable cup.</em></strong> Since the perforations are larger, there is more grit in the output when using the metal disk, so you end up with a (small amount) of ""sludge"" in the bottom of your cup, and it will turn bitter more quickly because of longer contact with the grounds after brewing.</p>

<p>As an aside, I also prefer it for the marginal (and debatable) ""health"" reasons. Paper filters remove some compounds (such as cafestol) that have purported cholesterol-affecting properties. For more of ""my opinion"" on that, see <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1571/whats-the-difference-between-paper-and-long-lasting-filters"">this question about general comparison between paper and re-usable filters</a> and <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/1578/262"">my answer</a> about the topic in general.</p>

"What water temperature and pour speed are best for pour-over method?","6002","","<p>I had a recent discussion with a friend of mine, which is the right <em>method</em> to brew the coffee for pour-over.</p>

<p>I read that it's best to pour in hot (but not boiling) water into the filter and moisten the coffee powder. After that I should pour in the water until it is round about 1 cm over the coffee powder. After that I should let it flow out and fill the water up until it's reached the 1 cm mark over the powder.</p>

<p>His method is a bit different. He just pours the hot (even if it's still boiling) water into the filter. He briefly moistens the coffee and then lets the rest of the water pour into the filter until his water can is empty. He only pauses from pouring if it reaches the top of the filter. </p>

<p>I said that his method isn't good, as the water will flow faster through the filter and the coffee won't be as aromatic as it would be with my method.</p>

<p>The brewing process I'm using is using the hand-filter with the Hario V60.</p>

<p>Which method is better? Does it matter how fast to pour the water in? Does it matter if the water is just hot or still boiling?</p>
","<p>You're highlighting two differences between the two methods:</p>

<ul>
<li>temperature of the water, and</li>
<li>rate of pouring the water (equivalently, how ""full of water"" is the cone).</li>
</ul>

<p>Short story: Use water just off the boil (about 96°C / 205°F). I prefer your ""slower"" pour method over your friend's... read on for why.</p>

<p>Longer story:
Keeping all other factors identical, here's my take on each. I aggregate information from my own experience and from several other sites (including <a href=""https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/drip"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Blue Bottle</a> and <a href=""https://www.stumptowncoffee.com/brew-guides/bee-house"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Stumptown</a> and <a href=""http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/06/make-better-pourover-coffee-how-pourover-works-temperature-timing.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Serious Eats</a> and <a href=""http://coffeegeek.com/guides/howtouseapourover"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Coffee Geek</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Temperature.</strong> Most agree that water for pour-over should be <strong>just off the boil</strong>, but exact temperature is both difficult to <em>measure</em> and to <em>maintain</em>. Exact recommendations differ, but most (including the 4 above) are approximately in the range of <strong>93-97°C / 200-207°F</strong>. At this temperature, you extract the best balance of the ""right stuff"" from the beans. Much hotter or colder than this and it will have an ""off"" taste, such as more bitter. For example, try brewing coffee at 80°C / 175°F and see how it tastes compared to coffee brewed with 96°C / 205°F water.</p>

<p>With <em>my</em> technique and equipment, anyway, it would be essentially impossible for me to measure or maintain a temperature this accurately. Removed from the heat, the kettle itself will immediately start to cool; the water will cool between the pour spout and when it hits the grounds in the cone; the water will cool more when sitting on the grounds. For this reason, <em>I take water from a boiling kettle and begin to pour at my leisure.</em> It might be a few degrees too hot at first, but it will probably finish a few degrees too cool.</p>

<p><strong>Rate of pouring the water.</strong> This seems to have more debate, e.g., on the 4 sites I listed above. Some pour only enough water at a time to have water just covering the grounds (like you and Blue Bottle), and some pour all the way up to the top of the cone (like your friend and Stumptown) -- however, a disadvantage of this all-at-once method is that some of the coffee will get pinned to the side of the cone for the final ""drainage"" and will not spend as much time in contact with the water; therefore some of your friend's coffee grounds will be underextracted. <strong>I do something of a hybrid: pour at such a rate as to keep the <em>output</em> at a steady rate.</strong> The dripping rate will decrease as the filter gets somewhat clogged with grounds, so I keep very slowly raising the water level in the cone (just exceeding the rate of output); I find this produces the best result. Other ideas are to stir (as Coffee Geek suggests) or pour in batches (as Serious Eats suggests).</p>

<p>All that said, other factors (e.g., the quality and freshness of beans) are overwhelmingly more significant than the manner of pouring.</p>

"What does a coffee cherry taste like?","5085","","<p>Do they keep long enough to ship? Can they be ordered from somewhere? Can they be dried/preserved/candied?</p>

<p>Can the flavor be used ... perhaps in a coffee beverage?</p>

<p>In the washed and semi-washing processing, the fruit is completely removed and discarded (and presumably not recoverable). In the dry processing, the fruit is allowed to ferment before removal, which presumably contributes much of the <em>fruit</em> and <em>wine</em> notes in dry-processed coffees like Sanani from Yemen and some single-origin Ethiopian coffees (eg. Starbucks Ethiopia Shirkina). If the fruit can do this ..., there must be more potential there, right?</p>
","<p>Lots of questions! Starting from the top...</p>

<p><strong>Taste?</strong> Coffee cherries are mild in flavour and slightly sweet. The flavour is somewhat reminiscent of other red fruits, like a mild mix of fruits like raspberry, red mulberry, currant, cranberry, cherry, raisin. I've only had them dried, so they have a little bit of a ""dried fruit"" taste (e.g., as raisins are to grapes). To me, they also have a little bit of a mild taste of tobacco leaf. When steeped in water to make a drink called <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/451/yemenite-tea-like-coffee""><em>cascara</em> (see this question/answers)</a>. The beverage tastes to me a bit like rooibos (red bush tisane). Some coffee shops sell the beverage.</p>

<p><strong>Shipping?</strong> I've only seen <em>dried</em> coffee cherries for sale. Perhaps ""fresh"" coffee fruits are available in the coffee belt, but the seeds (i.e., coffee beans) are so valuable that I think the whole fruit doesn't make it very far outside of production regions.</p>

<p><strong>Availability?</strong> Various specialty retailers sell the dried fruit pulp and skins (some call them the ""husks"") -- here's <a href=""http://www.vervecoffeeroasters.com/products/cascara-coffee-cherry-tea"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">one example from Verve</a>. Searching for coffee berries, cherries, husks, or for beverages like <em>cascara</em> or <em>qishr</em> may reveal more outlets.</p>

<p><strong>Other preservation?</strong> Coffee skins/pulp dry well. Rehydrating is possible but underwhelming. I have tried to make a kind of marmalade out of them; see <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1508/what-variety-of-coffee-berries-are-good-for-jam"">this seminal question</a>, and also <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/54942/how-should-i-make-jam-out-of-coffee-cherries-or-coffee-cherry-husks"">a follow-up question of mine at Seasoned Advice</a>.

"How does drinking coffee after a heavy meal counteract the drowsiness?","4582","","<p>General knowledge tells you that eating a heavy meal will make you drowsy since blood is being redirected for use in the digestion.</p>

<p>At the same time coffee does make you more alert because of some chemical effects.</p>

<p>Can the chemical properties of coffee really overcome the need of blood for the brain to be more active? I think that the blood flow is fundamental to avoid feeling drowsy but whenever I drink coffee after a meal I get really alert and almost feel no post-meal drowsiness.</p>
","<p>I am by no means a biochemist/physiologist, but I will give this my best scientific go.</p>

<p>The main reason people get sleepy after eating large meals, ""get the 'itis"" as many call it, simply has to do with homeostasis. The average person's diet usually consists mostly of carbohydrates. Carbs, especially when eaten in large quantities, causes a large spike in our blood sugar. In order for your body to bring the sugar levels back down to normal, the body releases insulin. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This stimulates movement of tryptophan (an amino acid in the brain), which then leads to the increased production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter responsible for sleep. And this increased level of serotonin triggers sleepiness after a meal. - See more at: <a href=""http://blog.zocdoc.com/get-sleepy-meal-weird-science-daily-life/#sthash.fseXW9aA.dpuf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://blog.zocdoc.com/get-sleepy-meal-weird-science-daily-life/#sthash.fseXW9aA.dpuf</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dangerously enough, constant spiking and falling of the blood sugar levels in the human body can lead to T2 Diabetes (most associated with processed sugars).</p>

<p>Tryphtophan is the same amino that is found abundantly in turkey may be why some people take snoozes after large Thanksgiving day meals!</p>

<p>Now, this brings us to the coffee portion. Coffee has caffeine which is a CNS stimulant. It increases blood pressure, metabolism, causes natriuresis (increase in saline secretion), but most obviously, may cause jitteriness, mild anxiety and alertness.</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine#Pharmacodynamics"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This is because when caffeine is consumed, it antagonizes adenosine receptors; in other words, caffeine prevents adenosine from activating the receptor by blocking the location on the receptor where adenosine binds to it. As a result, caffeine temporarily prevents or relieves drowsiness, and thus maintains or restores alertness.</a></p>

<p><strong>It is not the blood in your body that affects sleepiness/alertness, rather the neurotransmitters and their chemical synapses</strong>
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/r7mcd.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/r7mcd.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Does the AeroPress simply make ""stronger"" coffee with regards to caffeine content?</p>
","<p>Aeropress coffee (hearby called Aerpresso in this post) is more concentrated than regular drip coffee.  However, if you are using similar amounts of grounds as you would in a drip machine, you shouldn't notice any difference.  Caffeine is highly soluble in hot water and most any extraction method utilizing hot water will result in nearly full extraction of caffeine from grounds.</p>

<p>Aerpresso ends up somewhere in caffeine concentration between espresso (very concentrated) and drip coffee (less concentrated).  However, the total amount of caffeine is dependent more on the amount of grounds used that the extraction method (with the above listed methods). </p>

"Why is drinking Espresso in the afternoon fine, while milk coffee is not?","3857","","<p>I have often heard and seen, especially in Italy, recommendations to avoid coffee with milk like Latte or Cappuccino in the afternoon, while Espresso is widely consumed during this time of day. </p>

<p>What is the reason for this? Why would one avoid milk-based coffee drinks during the afternoon?</p>
","<p><strong>It is a cultural issue, not a health one.</strong></p>

<p>Traditionally, rich, big coffee drinks like a cappuccino are drunk in the morning in Italy with breakfast whereas espresso is what is drunk in the afternoon. The reasoning for this is that you can take your time and savor a cappuccino in the morning because presumably you are not at work yet, but in the afternoon you are just in and out for a quick energy infusion on a 15 minute break and you don't have the time to drink anything but a shot or two of espresso. </p>

<p>In America people tend to do just the opposite or just drink what they want, when they want which can lead to some judgement when visiting Italy. </p>

"What is a café allongé, and how is it pronounced?","3679","","<p>My question is actually in reference to a JavaScript book by Reg Braithwaite titled ""JavaScript Allongé"". Obviously JavaScript has almost nothing to do with coffee, but the author maintained a coffee barista metaphor throughout the book and stated that allongé is some coffee variant. So for the uninitiated coffee drinkers out there among his readers, can you explain what an allongé is, what makes it unique, and how to actually pronounce it? </p>

<p>The author does offer a brief description quoted from <em>Caffe Molinari</em> linked <a href=""https://leanpub.com/javascriptallongesix/read#leanpub-auto-a-pull-of-the-lever-prefaces"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>, but as a coffee newbie much of what is being described escapes me. Here is the quoted text from Braithwaite's preface:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Café Allongé, also called Espresso Lungo, is a drink midway between
  an Espresso and Americano in strength. There are two different ways to
  make it. The first, and the one I prefer, is to add a small amount of
  hot water to a double or quadruple Espresso Ristretto. Like adding a
  splash of water to whiskey, the small dilution releases more of the
  complex flavours in the mouth.</p>
  
  <p>“The second way is to pull an extra long double shot of Espresso. This
  achieves approximately the same ratio of oils to water as the dilution
  method, but also releases a different mix of flavours due to the
  longer extraction. Some complain that the long pull is more bitter and
  detracts from the best character of the coffee, others feel it
  releases even more complexity.</p>
  
  <p>“The important thing is that neither method of preparation should use
  so much water as to result in a sickly, pale ghost of Espresso.
  Moderation in all things.”</p>
</blockquote>
","<p><strong>Café allongé</strong> is the French for Italian <strong>cafe lungo</strong>, or in English, <strong>long espresso</strong>.</p>

"What's The Difference Between Paper and Long-Lasting Filters","3646","","<p>Lots of people use lots of filters for drip- or filter-brewed coffee. Some use paper and others use these durable filters. The performance to me is the same but many people argue that. They do have their pros and cons as said this <a href=""http://www.welovecoffeemakers.com/permanent-coffee-filter-vs-paper/"">website</a>. So paper filters are easy to use and bad for the environment and long lasting filters last longer and are more environmental friendly... The site has somewhat decent amount of information, but not a lot of information.</p>

<p>What are the significant differences between long-lasting filters and paper filters for drip or filter coffee?  </p>
","<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> Permanent filters win on cost over time. Paper filters win on performance, clean-up, and health. Flavour is personal preference. Composting paper filters and spent grounds alleviates most of the environmental benefit of permanent filter.  <strong>My conclusion: paper filters, discarded into a compost pile, win hands down.</strong></p>

<p>Use of permanent versus one-time-use filters is a perennial question, with both concrete and personal-preference arguments. In addition to the link in the original post, there are a few other online articles with comparisons, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>[1] pretty good <a href=""http://www.air-n-water.com/coffee-filters-information.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pro/con overview from air-n-water</a> (obscure?);</li>
<li>[2] from <a href=""http://worldofcaffeine.com/2011/06/20/filter-drip-coffee-paper-vs-metal-filters/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">World of Caffeine</a>;</li>
<li>[3] from <a href=""http://www.livestrong.com/article/281062-health-effects-of-gold-coffee-filters/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">LiveStrong</a>, which advocates permanent filters (but has other statements with which I disagree);</li>
<li>[4] from <a href=""http://www.melitta.com/en/Why-We-Filter-1662.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Melitta</a>, but this may need a grain of salt, because they're in the business of making paper filters :)</li>
</ul>

<p>From those and my personal experience, I extracted an overview and conclusions, below. Unfortunately I've written <em>a lot of text</em> here, but there's a lot of facets. I've focused basically on <strong><em>paper versus metal mesh</em></strong>, as the most common types; I maintain the conclusions are similar regardless of material.</p>

<p><strong>Material.</strong> There are several materials used for permanent filters, including the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>metal mesh (stainless steel or ""gold tone"");</li>
<li>nylon (or other plastic) mesh;</li>
<li>perforated metal (thin metal sheet with holes);</li>
<li>fabric (e.g., flannel, muslin, hemp).</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these surely have different properties, but properties that I focus on here are common to most.</p>

<p>One-time-use filters are predominantly paper, but could also be bamboo, natural fibre, or other material. See also <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1524/how-do-brown-and-white-paper-filters-compare"">this question for a comparison of brown versus white paper filters</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Performance.</strong> Paper filters are a finer filter; a permanent filter will permit some larger particles through to the cup. I find that a pot brewed with a permanent mesh filter will have a fine silt of coffee grounds at the bottom. For this same reason, some recommend to use a coarser grind for permanent filters.</p>

<p>Paper filters are also claimed to filter out some compounds (e.g., diterpenes such as <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/414/262"">cafestol, which may increase blood cholesterol levels</a>). Coffee brewed by other (non-paper-filter) methods have a higher concentration of cafestol in the resulting beverage.  See article [2] for more health claims of paper filters. On the other hand [3] says that paper filters filter out some <em>good</em> things, such as antioxidants, but I haven't seen that claim anywhere else.</p>

<p><strong>Flavour.</strong> Link number [4] claims better taste on paper filter than permanent filter (I happen to agree).  Permanent filters should also allow more oils to pass through, which will certainly have an impact on flavour; this is probably personal preference. The grit that passes through will also have a bittering effect over time, but probably not significant if you're drinking right away. Some (e.g., [1]) say nylon/plastic mesh will retain off-flavours over time.</p>

<p><strong>Cost.</strong> Varies greatly, but one can find permanent filters that are said to last for ""years"" for a few quid ($/€/£) up to 20-30 quid. Though dependent on usage and other factors, you'll have reasonable expectation of saving money over time by using a permanent filter.</p>

<p><strong>Clean-up.</strong> Clearly, the spent grounds from re-usable filters must be cleaned out; paper filters and their spent grounds can be pitched wholesale.  See another question about <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1518/do-i-need-to-clean-my-drip-brew-coffee-makers-filter-every-time"">how often and how much to clean a permanent filter</a>. On the other hand, [3] claims that permanent filters are cleaner, but I don't agree.</p>

<p><strong>Waste / environmental issues.</strong> I couldn't find any data on how much energy is used to produce a paper filter versus a reusable filter, but many uses would certainly be necessary to break even! As far as waste volume though, you'll make up the difference with paper filters pretty quickly (but composting the paper instead alleviates this!). Cleaning permanent filters additionally requires water and detergent. Though, you may wish to <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1551/should-i-rinse-paper-coffee-filters-before-use"">rinse your paper filters</a>, so water use is debatable. Ultimately, reusable filters will eventually wear out and need to be replaced.</p>

<p><strong>My Conclusion.</strong> For my money, personally, <strong>I prefer the paper filter:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Better flavour and texture (less bitter, less grit);</li>
<li>Convenience (easier to use and keep clean);</li>
<li>I compost the whole thing (paper filter, grounds and all), so the environmental impact is basically on the production end, which I'm okay with.</li>
<li>Marginal health concerns (cafestol/cholesterol; avoiding plastic whenever possible).</li>

"How long does it take to reset caffeine tolerance","3615","","<p>I've read on different websites, mainly fitness related, about cycling a pre-workout due to a build up of caffeine tolerance. 
The suggestions generally range in 1-2 weeks, but I think this would be a great question to have here.  Some links would be nice, if you could point me to some studies.</p>

<p>So, How long does it take to reset caffeine tolerance to pre-caffeine levels? </p>

<p>Can lowering down caffeine for a period of time work as a partial caffeine tolerance recalibrator? </p>
","<p>If you are looking at cycling your caffeine naivety with an eye for fitness  benefit (caffeine increases exercise tolerance), I think you should first look into whether there is any true benefit to the cycling.  You are talking about purposefully inducing a cycle of addiction/dependence and withdrawal, however, I am not sure I have ever heard that the exercise tolerance from caffeine decreases as caffeine tolerance increases.</p>

<p>In cycling (a sport I am familiar with) most pros maintain some level of caffeine tolerance.  I've the routine before the day's workout is an espresso or two.  I've never heard of cycling that caffeine intake.  With a doping and performance maximization such a ever present in cycling, it seems like if there was really benefit to cycling, it would be happening.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.livescience.com/5374-coffee-lessens-pain-exercise.html"" rel=""nofollow"">This article</a> suggests that the exercise tolerance is the same or similar regardless of the level of caffeine dependence. (<a href=""http://users.clas.ufl.edu/msscha/premed/caffeine_musclepain.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">actual study here</a>) The most I could find online for cycling was some bodybuilding forums talking about cycling their pre-workout stimulants.  Not really any specific information about what is contained in the mess of supplements they are taking. </p>

<p>Based on that study and the lack of information for cycling caffeine tolerance, I'd suggest that the withdrawal symptoms and side effects of caffeine consumption on naive individuals are not worth the purported but undocumented benefit of cycling your caffeine consumption.  I think while it's true that some of the mental stimulation and other effects of caffeine may taper off with tolerance, the exercise tolerance benefit does not.  However, individuals ignorant of this, or seeking mainly the mental stimulant part of caffeine effects, may resort to cycling their caffeine intake.  </p>

<p>TL;DR The bottom line is for physical performance, there is not a reason to cycle.  For mental performance there is a build up of tolerance and off periods would provide a benefit at the cost of symptoms encountered during the withdrawal period.</p>

"Chemically, what's happening to coffee after it's brewed?","3493","","<p>So I've prepared my coffee in the morning, and transferred it to a thermos flask, where it will only cool down negligibly over the course of the day.</p>

<p>Is anything happening to the coffee in the flask? Will the taste of the coffee change over the course of the day, or will a cup poured at 5pm taste essentially the same as one poured first thing in the morning?</p>

<p>If I had a perfect flask that lost no heat, how long would my coffee stay tasting as fresh as possible?</p>
","<p>The biggest chemical change that is going to occur is going to be <strong>oxidation.</strong></p>

<h2>Oxidation</h2>

<p>Chemically, oxidation is defined as the following from <a href=""http://www.blackbearcoffee.com/resources/81"" rel=""noreferrer"">this source.</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oxidation is any reaction in which one or more electrons
  are moved from one chemical to another, producing two different
  compounds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Specifically related to coffee, oxidation is further elaborated upon as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In coffee, the most common process is that an oxygen molecule donates
  two electrons to a compound, forming a new (differently perceived)
  compound and bonding with hydrogen to form water.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oxidation of coffee occurs when oxygen molecules (present in the air in your flask and also dissolved in the water used to brew the coffee) come into contact with different compounds in the coffee. Even if you had no air whatsoever in the flask, this process would still happen due to the dissolved oxygen in the water used to make the coffee.</p>

<p>The process of oxidation occurs much more readily at higher heats, hence the reason why cold brewed coffee does not go stale as quickly. </p>

<p>When the oxygen combines with the hydrogen, water is created. That hydrogen ion, when it was free, was adding to the acidity of the coffee. Once it is no longer free and connected to the oxygen, in the form of water, the pH of the coffee will rise slightly, making the coffee more bitter. This is can be perceived as 'staleness'.</p>

<p>The compounds which are oxidized are the acids, aromatics, and oils.  All of these give your coffee it's great taste.</p>

<h2>Loss of heat</h2>

<p>As the coffee cools, the molecules will vibrate more slowly. This leads to a drop in temperature and will occur in any container, no matter how good it is. Since you have described a situation with minimal heat loss, this process is negligible.</p>

<h2>In Conclusion</h2>

<p>The oxidation causes the coffee to become stale. This is a bean roasters worst nightmare. For the brewed coffee, it dismantles aromatics, acids, and oils - all key contributors to the coffee's flavor. It also raises the pH to make it more bitter and adds water to the mix.</p>

<p>So no, it won't taste the same at 5 pm as it would poured first thing in the morning. The taste of the coffee will change over the course of the day.</p>

<p><strong>Answering your final question about duration of freshness:</strong></p>

<p>How long will your coffee stay fresh in a perfect flask? That is a matter of opinion. Every coffee shop has a different standard for how long they let their brewed coffee sit. It can be 15 minutes to an hour.</p>

<p>As soon as you roast a bean, it begins to stale. As soon as you grind coffee, it begins to stale. As soon as you brew coffee, it begins to stale. It's hard to qualify what you will consider to be 'fresh'. A purist will tell you that unless you consume the coffee immediately, your coffee will be stale.</p>

<p>As I said, it is a matter of opinion, and if you have the perfect flask, I would say you could wait about an hour before your coffee becomes stale. That's just me though. <strong>The sooner you drink it the better.</strong></p>

<h2>What You Can Do</h2>

<p><strong>Ensure there is little to no air left in your flask.</strong> You might also look into cold brewing.</p>

"Differences between Chemex & V60","3424","","<p>I currently use a V60, but I'm interested in using a Chemex (primarily because of the bigger capacity for guests).</p>

<p>Assuming all variables are correct for the specific brew method (grind size, weight of coffee, filters etc) but the coffee &amp; water used are from the same source.</p>

<p><strong>What would be the differences between the taste of a cup of coffee from a Chemex and a cup from a V60?</strong></p>
","<p>Here's a few more things to add to @fredley's answer.</p>

<p>Since the water is going to be in contact with the grounds for a longer time (1- using greater volume of water, and 2- Chemex filter will be slower) you're going to get more of the bitter notes that you get (in general) by using a longer brewing time. Acidity will be offset somewhat by the bitterness. I find Chemex to be like a filter-coffee version of the body of a French Press preparation, though with no sediment. Compared to the throughput of V60 filters, @fredley hit it on the nose.</p>

<p>Though you are asking about taste specifically, there are other factors.</p>

<p>Like @fredley said, the filter paper in Chemex is <em>much</em> thicker and water drains through it <em>significantly</em> more slowly. You'll probably want to use a coarser grind (and very even grind) than you would for V60 or Melitta-style filters. Fines are the enemy of Chemex, causing the filter to clog and welling (see <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1658/why-does-the-filtrate-sometimes-well-up-in-the-upper-cone-when-using-the-chemex"">this question about ""welling up"" in a Chemex</a> for more on that). Certainly use the best burr grinder you can and don't delay in the pouring action.</p>

<p>Technique is ""more important"" (read as: ""finicky"") with Chemex, I think, than other pour-over systems. See preparation guides such as from <a href=""http://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com/brewing-product-care-instructions"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Chemex itself</a>, or <a href=""https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/chemex"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Blue Bottle</a>, or <a href=""https://www.stumptowncoffee.com/brew-guides/chemex"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Stumptown</a>, or search for others.</p>

"Does sweet coffee exist?","3422","","<p>I am looking for a coffee type that is naturally sweet, like sugar snap peas. So there is no need to add sugar, when I drink it.</p>
","<p>This question is probably best answered in two directions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you feel the need to add sugar to your coffee, it may simply be that the coffee that you are drinking is not very good. Sugar makes a lot of things taste better in addition to the sweetness that it adds. There are many ways to improve the quality of your coffee, like buying better and fresher beans, grinding right before brewing instead of buying pre-ground coffee, etc. Whether any of that is feasible depends on your coffee drinking circumstances - e.g., if you need to use your office's drip coffee machine with the coffee bought by the kitchen management, there is not a lot that you can do.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to add sweetness because you like it sweet, but you still want to avoid adding sugar for some reason, you can try the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>There are a couple of <strong>coffee bean types that have a slightly sweet flavour</strong>. For example, I have a some ""Starbucks 2015 Christmas Blend Espresso"" here, which is described by the producer by ""Cedar and herbal spiciness with an intense caramelly sweetness"". When using the beans in a pump-driven espresso machine, the espresso indeed has some sweetness. <strong>But don't expect too much.</strong> Coffee is natually low-calorie, which means that there can only be a little bit of sweetness. There are some coffee types that are naturally sweeter than others. According to a book that I have, lightly roasted <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_coffee"" rel=""nofollow"">Arabica Bourbon</a> coffee beans should have a ""fine sweetness"". Panama Volcan Baru Coffee is also listed as particularly sweet. Against, don't expect too much - ""particularly sweet"" means in comparison to other beans!</p></li>
<li><p>In case you prefer to drink your coffee with milk, you may want to switch to lactose-free milk. In that type of milk, the lactose has been split into shorter sugar molecules, which makes the milk taste quite sweet without a noticeable change in calories. </p></li>

<p>According to <a href=""http://teeccino.com/images/uploads/pages/File/DECAF.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">this source</a>, the nature of the beans used to make decaf coffee are higher in acidity in any case, because these beans are used due to their ability to retain flavor after treatment.</p>

<p>If you ever want to branch out into espresso or french press coffee, I recommend returning it and getting a better one.</p>

<h2>Final Notes</h2>

For the civet to choose a bean, it has to be <em>just right</em> when it comes to the aroma, and given the sensitivity of this creature's nose, said aroma means the bean is perfect. Some say the digestive process itself lends to better flavor, it can be a matter of heated debate depending on where you ask ;)</p>

<p>The thing is, the cat doesn't digest the whole bean, just the outer pulp. Farmers follow them around and wait for nature to take its course, then the beans are processed in a very safe manner. Farmers typically get just a kilo or so a day, it's quite an intensive process.</p>

<p>I drink it as often as I can afford to do so, and I have never gotten sick. It's a partly fruity, partly nutty and just an all over <em>cozy</em> and relaxing taste that I highly recommend if you're able to get the coffee. Just be prepared to pay quite a bit, and ready to consume it quickly after getting it home (it does not keep as well as others, probably due to local transportation issues prolonging the time it takes from roasting to actually get to market).</p>

<p>If you have a hand-powered burr grinder, I recommend using it and grinding pretty gingerly, even the heat of most ceramic grinders is enough to lose a little bit of the fruity taste you'd otherwise get. Really, treat these beans like royalty, they're that good.</p>

<p>If you buy some, try to avoid buying from farms with captive civets - the growing popularity of this coffee has led to a cottage trapping industry, which is (unfortunately) likely to seriously endanger them soon.</p>

"Why is a cup of coffee not 6 oz.?","3339","","<p>According to Google, a cup is 8 oz.</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cup_%28unit%29#Metric_cup"" rel=""noreferrer"">According to Wikipedia</a>, a cup of coffee as measured on the coffee maker is only 5.07 oz.</p>

<p>Every brand of coffee I buy shows directions for 1 tbsp. per 6 oz..</p>

<p>So, why is a cup of coffee only 5.07 oz. when nobody (that I know of) uses a cup that small? In fact, in most establishments, you can't even buy a ""small"" cup of coffee that is less than 8 oz. </p>

<p>Is this just a conspiracy so that the coffee maker companies can exagerate their capacity while the coffee companies dupe people into using too much coffee per cup or is there another reason? </p>

<p>Why not just make it 6 oz.? </p>
","<p>Do not blame the coffee makers for what has akways been an ambiguous meassure - or rather, not a unit for meassuring at all. Only in some areas of the world a ""cup"" has evolved into a fixed unit.</p>

<p>First and foremost, a cup is a drinking vessel for usually hot beverages and usually with a handle.</p>

<p><em>How big</em> a cup is, is primarily a cultural thing. To showcase two extremes:</p>

<p>An espresso cup <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yL69b.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yL69bm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>(<a href=""http://deals.simplyshellie.com/6-jumbo-coffee-mugs-999/"" rel=""noreferrer"">source</a>) </p>

<p>I am from Germany. We typically use [ml] for volumetric meassurements. Whenever I come across a recipe quoting ""cups"" I start my research: Where did it originate? Is it from the US? I use 245 ml. From current Germany? Probably 200 ml. From my Granny's time? 150 to 180 ml probably fits the bill.</p>

<p>Similar rues apply for coffee, from a small espresso or mokka cup in southern Europe or the Arab world to a mug of filtered coffee in the US. </p>

<p>There seems to be one correlation though - the ""stronger"" (=more concetrated) a coffe is customarily prepared, the smaller the cup. The amount of ground coffee per ""serving unit"" seems surprisingly constant for the various preparation styles - about a heaping teaspoon per ""cup"". The rest is a matter of taste.</p>

"Whats special about the Hario V60 filterpapers?","3290","","<p>I'm using the Hario V60 for quite some time and I always used the V60 filterpapers which are stated to be the best for my ceramic dripper. I never thought about it, until a friend of mine ask me whats special about them and why I don't use normal papers which will quite fit into them too and are much cheaper.</p>

<p>Honestly, I couldn't answer it for sure. I just thought about it, that I read something about a different paper structure but as I said. I'm not sure with this. </p>

<p>Is there any real difference between the V60 paper and normal filters or is it just the fact that they will fit better into my ceramic dripper?</p>
","<p><strong>Short version:</strong> The Hario brand filters are <strong><em>thinner than other paper filters</em></strong> and seem to have <strong><em>more texture</em></strong> than other types of filters. I assume this has some, but perhaps slight, impact on the <strong><em>rate at which water passes through the filter</em></strong> and also <strong><em>what ""stuff"" passes through the filter</em></strong>, which impacts the resulting brew and its taste.</p>

<p><strong>Longer version:</strong> The rest of this response is basically a comparison of the Hario filters to other types of filters. This isn't particularly authoritative nor scientific. I don't immediately find any good online resources on this; one video that I don't care to link or watch, and another article from <a href=""http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/11/best-ceramic-coffee-dripper-pourover-hario-bonmac-bee-house-kalita-reviews.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Serious Eats on dripper styles</a> but it doesn't compare the filters themselves as such. So, I'm going rogue.</p>

<p>The different cone (and filter) manufacturers each have their own shape, presumably to ensure product lock-in for consumables (in this case, primarily filters). Here are the three primary ones that I'm aware of:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NqO7d.jpg"" alt=""brown paper filters"">
Clockwise from upper left: off-brand Melitta-style #2, Hario brand V60 02, Chemex brand pre-folded bonded. All are ""natural"" brown (unbleached, etc.) varieties.</p>

<p>My basic summary, having looked at these three examples from my own stockpile (certainly, this is a small sample) in order from thickest to thinnest:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Chemex filter is very thick; almost more like like a thin pressed cotton cloth or fabric. Almost completely opaque. <a href=""http://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com/filters.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Chemex filter page</a> states that they are ""20-30% heavier"" than other filters and removes finer sediment and ""undesirable oils and fats"".</li>
<li>The Melitta-style is in the middle, and is similar in nature to most other Melitta-style and basket-style filter paper. Thick enough to be mostly opaque, but noticeably thinner than Chemex. The <a href=""http://www.melitta.com/en/2-Cone-Filter-Paper-Natural-Brown-40-Count-1428,64752.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Melitta brand filters</a> have claimed ""flavor enhancing perforations.""</li>
<li>The Hario brand is the thinnest by a fair margin. It's almost translucent through most of the filter, with a somewhat leaf-vein-like pattern to it, presumably from paper fibre and production method. This brown (""natural"") style seems to be called ""Misarashi"" for reasons I don't understand. There's little information on the Hario (<a href=""http://www.hario.co.uk/coffee/v60-filter-papers.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">.co.uk</a> / <a href=""http://www.hario.jp/product/list.php?middelclass=2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">.jp</a>) pages about the nature of the filters.</li>
</ul>

<p>Frankly, I don't notice a significant difference in coffee draining rate (throughput), but I suspect there is. I (personally) think there's a slight difference in taste and output of the brew, but perhaps I'm fooling myself into legitimizing more coffee gear.</p>

<p>As stated in <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/1969/262"">this other question about Hario V60 filters</a> off-brand filters do not seem common (in our regions).</p>

"What grind setting should I use for french press using a Capresso Infinity conical burr grinder?","3254","","<p>After years of suffering through with a blade grinder, I have finally bought a Capresso Infinity conical burr grinder. Now I need to figure out the settings to get the best cup of coffee I can from my French press.</p>

<p>So I know that I need a coarse grind for a French press. There are four coarse settings on the grinder. I also know that there are a lot of dependencies (especially brew time, types of beans, etc.). What experience have people had with the coarse settings of this particular grinder, and are there any good rules of thumb here?</p>

<p>I'm a coffee lover, but am new to the finer points of coffee making (just switched to a French press from drip in the last year) and am looking for any advice that may be pertinent. Many thanks in advance.</p>
","<p>I would recommend looking for which coarse setting seems to produce the most even grind. Really, the only potential danger you have is grinding so fine that you can't push the screen down.</p>

<p>The reason I recommend this is, like you mentioned, because everything else can be altered to your coffee's grind - the water temperature and extraction time. So you'll want to dial in a grind that's going to be evenly extracted. If your most coarse setting gives you big chunks and a lot of fine particles as well, then you're either going to over extract the fine and under extract the coarse, or vice versa depending on your brew time.</p>

<p>I hesitate to give you a dogmatic answer because I don't want to mislead you, but I also understand that it takes time to recognize even grinding and the grind size that is appropriate for the brew method. So I'll say that somewhere around medium to medium-coarse is going to be better. With smaller burr grinders, the coarsest setting has pretty uneven results.</p>

<p>Also, try playing with the extraction time. Start with two minutes, then try 3, on up to 5. If you keep everything consistent, you should be able to find exactly what works/tastes best for your situation.</p>

"Why do we need to fold the border of filters?","3202","","<p>Standard and V60 paper filters require we fold the border before spreading them for dripping.</p>

<p>I believe this is just because of their manufacturing process. But would there be any other reason?</p>

<p>Folding that border makes the surface uneven in the end, and it can sometimes be harder to control the water flow.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/R6Tms.jpg"" alt=""Folded border on a V60 filter""></p>
","<p>Here is what I found:</p>

<ul>
<li>Trying to tear out a proper filter is difficult. Filters do resist to boiling-water temperature.</li>
<li>Trying to tear out a proper filter <em>along the seam</em> is quite easy.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, by folding the filter on the seam, it seems we kind of hide the seam from direct contact with hot water. The seam glue is <em>not</em> weak these days, but this way there is no risk of tearing (e.g. if there is a defect in the seam), and the surface area inside the filter is also more uniform---the filter stands well in place.</p>

<p>There is a seam in the first place, because it is easy to manufacture fold-able filters this way (I am looking for a citation here).</p>

"Why would anyone want to hand grind their coffee?","3063","","<p>I often buy pre-roasted beans so that they last longer in storage. This means I have to grind the beans.</p>

<p>I have a cheap spice grinder that does a great job at preparing the beans into ground coffee. It is easy to use, takes 5-15 seconds to process half a dozen cups worth of beans, and I have  good control over how fine a powder to make the beans into. I'm pretty sure this is a similar story for almost everyone with an electric grinder.</p>

<p>Many grinders are lighter and smaller than electric ones. They are portable and can easily be packed for use when traveling.</p>

<p>As to the consistency, a conical grinder (electric or manual) will generally create a more consistent grind than a electric blade ""grinder"".

","<p>(Note: With a general perspective, you may classify coffee as a spice.)</p>

<p>I imagine you mention the hand grinders. In that case, the main difference is the size of the canals of the grinders. E.g. in a black pepper grinder, the average diameter of the canals are a bit wider than the average diameter of black peppers.</p>

<p>However, this diameter is far narrower for coffee beans. So, you cannot grind coffee in a pepper grinder effectively as the beans cannot fit in the canals.</p>

<p>Summary: proper grinder for proper spice.</p>

<hr>

<p>After Burhan added the image, I think I should make an edition to this answer.</p>

<p>This grinders are called blade grinders. The main disadvantage of these is the grounds are not homogenously grinded after the process. As the blades randomly cut the beans, some of them may stay intact on the sides.</p>

<p>Burr grinders doesn't have this possibility. All grinded pieces have a maximum volume after the process.</p>

<p>Otherwise, I can't think of a difference. However, you shouldn't use the same grinder for both. You don't want the aroma of your coffee to be mixed with spices and herbs. :)</p>

<p>So what else makes diner coffee taste like diner coffee? Examples of the kinds of places that serve this include chains like Waffle House, but also individual / locally owned diners.</p>

<p>The cheapest coffee suppliers usually mix beans from all over the place and they all store them way past any freshness date. Diners run on small budgets and generally buy the cheapest stuff, thus they all have the same ""flavor"".</p>

<p>Is there a documented process (not additive) to reduce the bitterness of coffee and any research in why that's the case?</p>
","<p>There are a lot of factors that contribute to the bitterness of coffee. Some of these have to do with the concentration of various compounds in the coffee and the roasting process, but the way you brew the coffee can make a big difference as well.</p>

<p>Assuming that you are not going to be harvesting and roasting your own coffee, we can focus on the brewing process.</p>

<p><strong>Buying Beans:</strong> Robusta vs Arabica</p>

<p>To decrease perceived bitterness in coffee, the best choice is Arabica. Arabica beans are often sweeter with notes of sugars and fruits and a somewhat wine-like acidity. Robusta on the other hand tends to be harsher with more bitterness. This difference in quality is reflected in cost however, as Arabica tends to be more expensive than Robusta.</p>

<p>In terms of roast level, medium roasts generally contain fewer soluble solids, more acidity and a stronger aroma than dark roasts. All of these should contribute to making medium roasts on average less bitter than dark roasts.</p>

<p>You have to find the sweet spot when it comes to temperature, a little trial and error can be used here depending on the blend and brewing method. For example, the people at AeroPress recommend a much lower temperature to reduce bitterness that what you would use in a french press.</p>

<p>In general research has shown that coffee brewed in hot water is perceived to be less bitter than when cold water is used. Additionally, bitterness is reduced when hard or soft water is used when compared to distilled water.</p>

<p><strong>Brewing [Extraction]</strong></p>

<p>Bitterness is strongly correlated with the amount of dissolved solids in the brewed coffee. To ensure that the amount of dissolved solids and the overall extraction is correct (and minimally bitter), make sure to use the correct grind coarseness, water temperature, and brew time for your chosen method. Over extraction can be a major cause of bitterness.</p>

<p>Drip and pour-over brewing methods tend to have less bitterness than a french press or other immersion methods. This can be attributed to less dissolved solids in the coffee. </p>

<p><strong>SCIENCE</strong></p>

<p>Much of this section will be outside the control of most, but it is interesting nonetheless. </p>

<p>Research has found that the introduction of polyphenols reduces the bitterness of coffee. The metallic bitterness found in some coffee has been attributed to  dicaffeoylquinic acids. Trigonelline is perceived as bitter at concentrations of 0.25% and its degredation is proportional to roast level. Roasting Trigonelline produces a byproduct called pyridines and helps create the roasty aroma found in some coffee.</p>

<p>Chlorogenic acid is also found in coffee, higher concentrations in Robusta than Arabica, and that contributes to the bitterness as well. Additionally, Quinic acid is a product formed from the degradation of Chlorogenic acid and is present in coffee at twenty times its taste threshold, contributing to the bitterness.</p>

<p>Furfuryl alcohol is also known to increase the bitterness of coffee.</p>

"How often do I need to change the filter on a siphon?","2492","","<p>Many siphons use a small piece of metal wrapped into a fine cloth. The piece of metal makes them robust, and it seems to me they can be used for a long time. The piece of cloth is usually of enough quality to remain in good condition for long. A piece of cloth can however get dirty, rough, etc.</p>

<p>How long do you recommend to use a siphon filter? What would be the criteria to drive for change?</p>
","<p>I've typically used the same cloth filter on a hario syphon for several (2 - 3 probably) months of continuous use (1 or 2 syphons daily). We clean the cloth after each use using a mild detergent, hot water and a soft scrubbing brush. Rinse very well after each wash. Typically, after a week or so we soak the cloth in oxyclean or similar for a couple of hours to get it super clean and then follow this up with a normal wash and thorough rinse. The coffee <strong>will</strong> stain the cloths after the first use, so don't expect it to return to the same colour it was originally no matter how often or well you wash it.</p>

<p>When we first bought a syphon about five years ago we were recommended to store the filter in a glass jar of water in the fridge to prevent it drying out between uses. If we aren't planning to use the filter for a while, we toss the cloth, clean the metal part and let it dry.</p>

<p>You can also clean the filter (with or without the cloth) in the dishwasher but I'd still recommend giving it a thorough rinse afterwards.</p>

<p>The cloths are fairly cheap and in my experience easy to find online so use your judgement - if you think it's time to switch cloths, it's probably time to use a new cloth!</p>

"How does one descale an espresso machine (and how often to do it)?","2352","","<p>One of the common regular maintenance items for an espresso machine is to descale it, to remove the buildup of minerals inside the machine (particularly the heating element).</p>

<ul>
<li>How often should I do this?</li>
<li>What are the benefits of regular descaling?</li>
<li>What do I need to do this?</li>
<li>How do I actually go about descaling the machine?</li>
</ul>
","<p>You can use a solution of citric acid and some espresso machine manufacturers will sell this specifically, you can use general purpose descaler, for which there should be instructions on how much to dilute it by.</p>

<p>Talking from experience it depends on how hard the water is where you live and you should really do it every month if it is a hard water area.</p>

<p>I also found that I need to remove the fine filter where the coffee is pumped out to remove the gasket seal and clean all of the above, I was lazy and neglected my Gaggia for about 6 months and after a couple years the solenoid pump died.</p>

<p>The less hassle method would be to use bottled soft mineral water. For instance I have started to only use this with my kettle and there is no limescale build up since switching 1 1/2 months ago, whilst before, using Brita filtered water would start to show limescale after a week and I'd need to descale after 3 weeks.</p>

<p>These are the instructions on my descaling solution for a coffee machine:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Add 100ml of solution to 500ml of water and add to water reservoir,
  turn on and run through the machine. Then run 2 full reservoirs of
  water before using again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I remember with citric acid you had to pump it through and then leave for 30 minutes and then fully flush a few times.</p>

<p>Here is a youtube video from Gaggia about performing this: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SPkjWJzUJQ"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SPkjWJzUJQ</a></p>

<p>The key thing here is that if you don't do it then limescale starts to form on the metal filter and gasket seals which will affect the flow rate. This isn't the worst bit though, like with any heating system that uses hard water, the hard limescale will inhibit the heating and pumping performance which can lead to a complete pump failure which is what happened to my machine, I recommend using citric acid (which is a weak acid and safe to consume in diluted form) and/or bottled mineral water.</p>

"Which type of coffee grinder is the quietest?","2305","","<p>Perhaps my question should be ""What is the best type of grinder to use at my desk if I work in a cubicle and use a French Press?"". </p>

<p>I have tried finding decibel measurements on Amazon's website, but most of the coffee grinders listed don't specify them.</p>
","<p>First, lets ignore blad grinders entirely.  Any grinder that doesn't have a motor will be relatively quiet.  You'll be at the mercy of the crunching beans, but that's it.  Add to this that the more the grinder weighs, or the more ""heft"" it has to it, the quieter it will typically be to the additional mass damping any vibration.  When adding a motor to the mix, each step between the motor and the burrs adds an opportunity for noise.  As such, a direct drive grinder will typically be quieter than anything involving a gearbox.   </p>

<p><strong>The pecking order is basically...</strong></p>

<p>Hand Grinder --> Direct Drive Flat Burr --> Direct Drive Conical Burr --> Gear-Reduced Burr</p>

<p>While Decibel ratings are available from most manufacturers, they're difficult to translate into a subjective estimate of ""harshness.""  I deal with these regularly and found that some of my favorite grinders are technically louder than several others, including the Baratza Vario; The difference is that they have a much more mellow drone rather than the gear motor's quieter whine.</p>

"What is the optimal brewing technique for extracting caffeine?","2293","","<p>I was wondering what process, or processes, would yield the highest caffeine quantity at a fixed drink size (Say 200ml).</p>

<p>Assuming the same variety of bean, same roast, same quantity, same water temperature and same extraction time. </p>
","<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I thought about this more. In sum, I believe that this question (as asked) is not answerable (but it <em>is</em> interesting!). With just about <em>any</em> selected brewing method, you'll be able to extract almost all of the caffeine from the beans. However, depending on the method chosen, you need to use different parameters to get full extraction (time, pressure, temperature, etc.). For example: Espresso is certainly the fastest to get full caffeine extraction, but you need a fine grind.  Filter/drip or French press are slower, but espresso-fine grind just won't work correctly; you need to use a coarser grind. Given the same beans, and the right technique for the given method, you can achieve almost 100% caffeine extraction.  </p>

<p>As an example of drip versus espresso, the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia article on caffeine</a> (and the two cited references that include figures on both espresso and drip caffeine content -- <a href=""https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/caffeine/caffeine_info1.shtml"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> and <a href=""http://www.caffeineinformer.com/the-caffeine-database"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a>) claim nearly the same caffeine content for drip versus espresso; in fact, they list that drip coffee has <em>slightly more</em> caffeine than espresso. I can't fully accept these, however, because there's no way to know if they're using arabica or robusta, light roast or dark roast, how much ground coffee was used to brew -- there's just too many unknowns that back those figures. Since arabica, for instance, is ~1% caffeine, with 7g of coffee (""standard dose"", from INEI) you'll be able to get ~70mg caffeine. Those are pretty consistent with the cited figures -- meaning 100% caffeine extraction.</p>

<p>So, you'd have to ask a different question in a different way (e.g., what's the fastest extraction method? or How to get 100% caffeine extraction with cold brew?) or so.</p>

<hr>

<p>I agree with most of @Chris in AK's answer (and +1!), but I wanted to add another take on this.</p>

<p>I don't think solubility is a big factor here; caffeine is <em>very</em> soluble in hot water -- approaching 66g/100mL (~150g/cup) in boiling water, and even at room temperature nearly 2g/100mL (~5g/cup) (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine#Chemical_properties"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">citation listed at Wikipedia</a> and <a href=""http://www.chemicalbook.com/ChemicalProductProperty_EN_CB0202769.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>). Yes, those are listed as <em>grams</em>, which means that water could dissolve <em>tens to hundreds of times</em> as much caffeine, as compared to the caffeine dose in an average cup/demitasse of strong coffee or espresso (which contain perhaps ~50mg-200mg per cup; see also questions on caffeine content, such as <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/79/how-can-i-figure-out-how-much-caffeine-is-in-my-cup"">this</a> and <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/94/how-much-caffeine-is-in-an-espresso-shot"">this</a>; also keep in mind that the <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/469/262"">lethal dose of caffeine</a> is somewhere in the 10g-20g range.)</p>

<p>Back to your actual question, I do agree that you've restricted yourself quite a bit; pressure is one of the few variables you didn't eliminate. To that end: a comparison of extraction of pressure-brewed (e.g., espresso) versus filter/drip follows.</p>

<p>In general, caffeine is quickly extracted from coffee beans (and tea leaves); most is extracted within 30 seconds of water contact (though this certainly depends on fineness of grind and other factors). Here's a visualization of <a href=""http://www.espressoplanet.com/espresso-coffee-machine/pressure_brewed_coffee_extraction.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">extraction of comparison of pressure-brewed and drip versus time</a>, which depicts the quantity of caffeine (and other stuff) extracted over time. I found it amusing that the context of that article is actually advocating for espresso as a way to brew <em>lower</em> caffeine content coffee; the point being that the ""other stuff"" (aroma, colour, flavour) is extracted even more quickly with pressure-brewed (versus drip) coffee.  So, if you extract for only 10 seconds (which is <em>very</em> short indeed) you'll get most of the ""other stuff"" but less caffeine. On the other hand, a finer grind will permit faster extraction of caffeine and everything else; <a href=""http://www.kickinghorsecoffee.com/en/blog/caffeine-myths-espresso-vs-drip"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this article suggests that espresso is higher in caffeine based on the grind factor</a>; I think there are too many other variables for that conclusion.</p>

However the ceramic V60 is the most visually appealing of the V60's (in my opinion) and it stays at my home on the counter so I prefer it.

"How does the temperature of the water affect the taste of the coffee","2139","","<p>Many methods of brewing coffee differ in the temperature of the water among other factors. Some people swear by cold-brewing, others do slow pour overs with piping hot water.</p>

<p>How exactly is coffee flavor changed by cold, warm, and hot water?</p>
","<p><strong>Temperature affects extraction rate, but also varies between compounds in the coffee beans.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Coffee grounds contain a hodgepodge of volatile and non-volatile components, such as various oils, acids, and other aromatic molecules [2]. Collectively, these compounds that are found in coffee grounds are referred to as “coffee solubles” and significantly contribute to coffee flavor [2]. Brewing is the process of extracting these components from the grounds, so coffee beverages are technically a solution of coffee solubles and water. Given that coffee grounds are used in both of our brewing methods, the principle variables are temperature and time.</p>
  
  <p>Temperature affects the solubility and volatility of the coffee solubles. Relative to brewing, solubility describes the ability of the solubles to dissolve out of the grounds and into the water; volatility refers to their ability to evaporate into the air. Coffee solubles dissolve best at an optimal temperature of 195-205°F [3]. With more coffee solubles extracted, hot brew coffees are described as more full-bodied and flavorful when compared to cold brew. Moreover, due to increased volatility with higher temperatures, the aromatics are more readily released from coffee, giving rise to that beloved scent of freshly-brewed coffee.</p>
  
  <p>On the downside, oxidation and degradation also occur more rapidly at higher temperatures. The oils in coffee solubles can oxidize more quickly at elevated temperatures, causing coffee to taste sour. Acids also degrade, the most notable of which is chlorogenic acid into quinic and caffeic acid, causing coffee to taste bitter [2].</p>
  
  <p>Where cold brew lacks in temperature, it makes up for in time. Coffee solubles have markedly decreased solubility in room temperature water. Increasing the brew time from a few minutes to many hours aims to maximize extraction of the solubles from the grounds. Even over twenty-four hours, not all the coffee solubles will have dissolved; this is why the amount of coffee grounds is doubled, in an effort to make up for the lower extraction rate. In comparison with hot brew, cold brew is sometimes described as tasting “dead” or “flat” due to the lower yield of coffee solubles [3]. Further, decreased volatility prevents aromatics from escaping from coffee as easily, so cold brew is much less perfumed than its hot brew counterpart.</p>
  
  <p>Oxidation and degradation will still occur in cold brew methods, but this happens much more slowly; bitterness and acidity are just about absent in cold brew coffee, especially if it is kept cold. Though, cold brew doesn’t merely taste like hot brew without the bitterness. Fans of the cold brew method have emphasized that cold brews contain a completely different flavor profile that can’t be found with hot brews. Going back to the idea of solubility, not all flavor compounds of coffee solubles are equally soluble. A good majority of the coffee solubles are still able to leach out of the grounds, even in colder water. The compounds that don’t dissolve are the ones often attributed to unfavorable flavors [4]: these stay in the grounds that are subsequently tossed away. Consequently, cold brews take on a much sweeter, floral profile.</p>
  
  <p>To note, brew time does not determine caffeine content, nor does bitterness indicate coffee strength. Caffeine is extracted early in the brewing process, so extending brew time, by either method, would only result in over-extracted coffee [1]. Coffee “strength” is defined as the amount of dissolved coffee solubles per unit of coffee volume [1]. On that train of thought, cold brew certainly produces stronger coffee, given that the brewing process purposely concentrates the coffee solubles. Though, keep in mind that rarely anyone drinks cold brew coffee straight up; many enjoy this smooth drink diluted with milk or water. - <a href=""https://scienceandfooducla.wordpress.com/2014/08/19/coffee-brewing-chemistry-hot-brew-and-cold-brew/"" rel=""nofollow"">Coffee Brewing Chemistry: Hot Brew vs. Cold Brew.</a></p>

","<p>If you stop washing your mocha pot completely, you'll see a bit of a residue buildup  on the inside of the pot from many past cuppas imparting their special oils to surface.

<p>Whether this effect can be quantified by a perceptible difference in taste, I see no reason to part with tradition; it is a badge of honor and the sign of a well-used pot. At the very least, you are saving yourself a lot of trouble in having to clean it out each time. You can certainly clean the <em>outside</em> with an appropriate cleaner if the patina isn't to your liking, but I would just rinse the inside with hot water.

"Difference between inverted and normal aeropress?","2106","","<p>Can someone tell me the difference between a coffee made using the ""normal"" aeropress technique and an inverted technique?</p>

<p>I know it can vary depending on coffee and brew time etc and overall it's down to personal taste. I'm just looking for the basic difference, eg</p>

<p><strong>Normal</strong> is, <em>this</em>, <em>this</em> &amp; <em>this</em>
<strong>Inverted</strong> is <em>this</em> &amp; <em>this</em></p>
","<p>The differences are minor, but there are differences.  When brewing normally, water begins to drip through the paper filter immediately when poured over the grounds.  After stirring I usually have to add more water after the bloom recedes.  Inverted, all the water stays with the grounds until you flip it over and start extracting.  The extra water added with the normal process is hotter, and I believe will tend to over extract bitter notes more easily, not only because of the higher temperature, but by virtue of the added volume of water passing through the grounds.</p>

<p>Inverted, however, the volume of water is less, and because of that, the temperature of that water will be lowered a bit.  You can extract quickly, or wait as long as you want to extract the coffee.  Additionally, I have seen it claimed that with the inverted method, oils that will rise to the top of the column will be forced through the filter first and flavor the coffee more than with the regular method where they tend to get trapped in the grounds.  </p>

<p>I have gone back and forth but always seem to go back to the inverted method. It provides more control of the variables and for me gives a better flavor, even when using the same beans, same roast, same water temperature.  Your mileage may vary of course.   </p>

<p>I imagine leaving the lid on will cause the water to heat up faster as the hot air inside the chamber cannot escape as easily, and I wonder if this affects the flavour or general coffee experience.</p>
","<p>So what I've been taught is that you should keep the lid open while brewing. This is so you can watch the progress of the extraction, and cut the heat at the appropriate time. It gives you much more control over your brew this way - for example, I cut the heat (and run the base under the cold tap for larger pots) as soon as I see the coffee running from the spout turn lighter, rather than waiting for the gurgle.</p>

<p>However, as for lid open/closed during brewing, I don't imagine this has any effect on the extraction. The amount of heat lost will be tiny in comparison to other variables.</p>

<p>If I want to go bigger am I going to have to do something custom?</p>
","<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>It sounds like you're starting a small business, in which case, you will quickly outgrow 5 gallon batch sizes as you begin distribution. </p>

<p>Depending on your needs, I would suggest purchasing industrial beer brewing equipment, such as conical fermenters and brite tanks. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Use of Conical Fermenter</h2>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JtmjA.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JtmjA.jpg"" alt=""Conical Fermenter""></a></p>

<p>The conical fermenter would allow you to long brew a batch, bubble nitrogen or CO2 up from the bottom for agitation (increasing extraction and preventing oxidation), and will let the grinds settle into the bottom shoulder of the tank when the brewing process is complete. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Use of Brite Tanks</h2>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iggKD.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iggKD.jpg"" alt=""Large Brite Tank""></a> </p>

<p>Brite tanks come in a range of sizes from ~1 gallon up to tens of thousands of gallons. They are primarily used as a glycol jacketed pressure rated storage vessel for keeping beer (and similar beverages) in optimial conditions before storage. They may also be used as part of the forced carbonation of the liquid in the tank.  A brite tank will be useful for your cold brew business as you scale up because it will give you an intermediary vessel to blend out and store batches before packaging. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Scaling up your production</h2>

<p>Depending on your business plans and packaging / distribution ability, 
you will probably want to start with a slightly larger setup that gives you 1) room to grow and 2) the ability to expand without changing process or systems. Beer equiptment is well suited to meet these goals. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Quality, consistency, and some notes on process:</h2>

<p>The majority of consumers demand a consistent product with an interesting flavor-profile that they can enjoy <em>every</em> time they purchase your product. Flavor-profile deviations will cause you to loose consumers to a more consistent product in the long run. The following points will help ensure a more consistent product: </p>

<ol>
<li>blend out batches of cold brew from the fermenters into a single brite tank</li>
<li>use CO2 or nitrogen to prevent oxidation</li>
<li>manual agitation is inconsistent - use a bubbler with CO2 or nitrogrn instead. This will also help with goal 2. </li>
<li>Packaging lines make a huge difference. Invest for growth in a rotary topper, not a 4 or 6 head. </li>
<li>Don't attempt to use the same blend of beans for cold brew, draft cold brew, and nitro. </li>

"When does coffee go off?","1966","","<p>If I've ground a batch of coffee, I know I should use it as soon as possible, but if I store it (in an opaque, air-tight, slightly-below-room-temp container), how long have I got to use it? Are there any key points at which the quality will degrade (e.g. after a day, after a week)?</p>
","<h1>Whole Bean Coffee Degradation Over Time</h1>

<p>Whole bean coffee will go stale within 14 days - on average. The graph below shows the quick 1.5 standard deviation drop in quality within the first 14 days (marked in red). <sub>*See note below for details</sub></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0Zu5y.png"" alt=""Degradation of Perceived Quality Over Time""></p>

<p>Staling in the context of coffee has a commonly agreed on definition - the loss of volatile aromatic compounds and the oxidation of surface oils on the roasted coffee beans. The loss of aromatics affects the flavor profile because: 1) they are both part of the same degradation process and 2) the majority of what you taste in coffee is flavors from volatile aromatics through retronasal olfactory sensation.</p>

<p>This graph was created using data from <a href=""https://gastrograph.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Analytical Flavor Systems</a> where we build quality control and flavor profiling tools for craft beverage producers. <em>Perceived Quality</em> is a non-hedonic assessment of a product's quality. This time series is taken from a degradation study.  </p>

<p>Ground coffee, on the other hand, will stale within minutes. 70 cc of ambient air is enough to render one pound of coffee stale. On average, this process takes seven minutes. </p>

<p>Interestingly, the degradation curve looks about the same! </p>

<h1>Data Analysis Minutia (notes)</h1>

<p>This time series model was segmented using daily <em>Perceived Quality</em> means from a random selection of 15,000 coffee reviews. All coffees included are whole bean, freshly ground, third wave coffee brewed in a Chemex with a bleached filter. </p>

<p>Certain other brewing methods, particularly methods optimized for older coffee such a Nel, may show a different degradation curve. </p>

<p>The <em>staling point</em> was selected by a parametric statistical change point analysis, which searches for shifts in the mean and variance of a time series. This time series was modeled for change point analysis using a Poisson distribution as  we're searching for the average number of coffees that go stale within a specific time-point, and the model was set to find <em>at most one change</em>.</p>

"Avoid clumps in finely ground coffee","1927","","<p>I am currently using a Baratza Encore grinder with my Saeco Aroma espresso machine.  I know that neither of these are very high quality products, but I really don't have the budget to upgrade.  The Encore is able to grind sufficiently fine and I have been quite happy with it, however, I get a lot of clumping when grinding for espresso.  It can be difficult to evenly distribute the coffee when you get these clumps, so it would be nice if there was an easy way to avoid this.  Anyone have any suggestions?  I've heard people say that a doser can solve this problem as the rotating sections will break up the clumps.  This is a nice solution, but I don't believe the encore is capable of being upgraded to have a doser.</p>
","<p>I wouldn't go so far as to say that it's not a very high-quality grinder, it does extremely well for the price. The clumping is an artifact of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Humidity</li>
<li>Heat from grinding</li>
<li>Type and roast of the bean</li>
</ul>

<p>Grinders that produce almost no heat while grinding, to the point that they do it reliably enough for it to be a listed feature cost <em>ten times</em> the amount that you paid for your grinder. Heat during grind isn't an indication of a low-quality grinder, rather, little to no heat is simply an indicator of a <em>very</em> high-quality grinder. There isn't much you can do about this other than purchase a manual burr grinder and grind by hand <em>very</em> gingerly, which takes lots of time.</p>

<p>Tamping alone should be sufficient to deal with any clumps (at approximately 15kg of force) - if it's not, then you want to take a very close look at the beans you're using, and the level of humidity they're exposed to in storage. Is your grinder normally close to anything that produces steam? Is your kitchen air really humid? Are the beans stored in air-tight containers? If you have clumps that tamping won't take care of, you probably have a moisture problem.</p>

<p>It can also be the bean, some roasts just <em>do not</em> do well for espresso, no matter how fine the grind or how dry the storage. </p>

<p>Both <a href=""http://www.lavazza.us/us/products/blends/espresso/qualita-oro/"">Lavazza</a> and <a href=""http://shop.illy.com/online/store/product_coffee-all-us_whole-bean-medium-roast_us"">Illy</a> produce a <em>very</em> pleasant medium arabica bean that should work very well in your grinder. They are <em>very</em> consistent in production, delicious, and should give you a good baseline to select other beans that would work similarly well. You <em>can</em> get beans that weren't specifically produced with espresso in mind to work, but it takes a bit of tinkering. I recommend the above beans very often to people just getting started because they're delicious and very easy to work with.</p>

<p>Anyway, try one of those, see what comes out of the grinder. If you're still getting clumps that don't immediately break down when you tamp (tap the portafilter on the sides a few times before you tamp to help this) you could try cleaning the grinder, changing how you store the beans, or looking at a de-humidifier in the area that you keep them. </p>

"How V60 and Aeropress affect flavor","1881","","<p>I've heard that the V60 is better for light roasts and the Aeropress is better for Medium to Dark roasts, but could someone describe how these two brewing devices affect the flavor of coffee brewed for the different roasts (and which, in turn, would be preferable)?</p>
","<p>That sounds like the generalization that drip or pour over brewing is better for light roasts and stronger brewing methods are better for darker roasts.  </p>

<p>I'll counter that by saying that I often use my Aeropress for lighter roasts and my Clever Dripper for dark roasts and those cups come out just fine.  </p>

<p>The Aeropress makes a sort of quasi-espresso cup that isn't true espresso, but is much stronger than just strong coffee.  I've found that it is unsuitable or less than satisfactory for beans that aren't recommended for espresso brewing.  While the Aeropress allows less control over ""brew"" strength.  The V60 should be more flexible.  Varying the grind and pour speed should allow a level of control not present with an Aeropress.  </p>

"Instant coffee to powdered milk ratio?","1874","","<p>I'm going backpacking in a few weekends, and in order to save on pack weight I've been dehydrating a lot of my meals. As I think about breakfast, I'm settling on carrying only powdered milk and instant coffee for my breakfast cup of joe. I was wondering if anyone has done this and what a good instant coffee to hot water to powdered milk ratio would be. What would the steps for making it look like? Would I add the powdered milk first or the coffee first, or both at the same time? Thanks!</p>
","<p>As a disclaimer, I've never done this, but here's the way I would do it if I were you:</p>

<p>First, determine how you like your coffee when its a regular cup of joe.  Once you know how much milk you use to however much coffee, determine how much powdered milk reconstitutes to the equivalent amount of regular milk.  Then determine how much instant coffee in a glass of hot water makes a comparably sized cup of regular black coffee.  When you've done that, you should have measurements for how much instant coffee and how much powdered milk you need for one cup of coffee.  (Be sure to make a test cup!) </p>

<p>Then for ease of use on the trail I would scale up the amounts based on how long of a trip and how many cups of coffee you think you'll want and combine the coffee and milk powders.  Thoroughly mixed, they can be stored in a single container, and since you know how much instant coffee and how much powdered milk to use separately in a given amount of hot water, you can add those amounts to know how much of the mix to put in your cup on the trail.  </p>

<p>I would do powder mix first, then hot water, and stir to combine/dissolve completely.</p>

"Is it necessary to keep a portafilter in the grouphead when not in use?","1854","","<p>Some say that keeping a portafilter in the grouphead is both beneficial for the machine <em>and</em> affects the quality of the espresso (by keeping the portafilter warm).</p>

<p>Is this accurate? If so, what are the benefits of doing so?</p>
","<p>Keeping the portafilter warm (and receiving / tamping a dose within a warm portafilter) is supposed to result in additional oils being released in the extraction, which in theory leads to a fuller pull and more crema. It's also supposed to add to the benefits of pre-infusion.</p>

<p>I have experimented at length with this, and <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/137/does-pre-heating-a-puck-on-the-group-head-produce-more-crema"">can detect positively no difference between a shot extracted from a cold filter, and one extracted from a warmed one</a>. It might only be noticeable on higher-end (larger) machines, or simply larger filters. </p>

<p>Mechanically, it's a sound enough practice as it would help keep the group head and portafilter from warping independently, even ever so slightly. Even though the seal they make is assisted by the inclined plane the filter travles to reach the head, it's still good for the filter to mate properly with the machine.</p>

<p>I asked my barista about this after Joel mentioned it, and he also said it's a good practice to keep. </p>

<p>tl;dr; It can't hurt, and it might help, but YMMV on lesser machines.</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong></p>

<p>Experiments in various presses, and the amount of crema they produce have shown that pre-warming <em>metal</em> filters produces more crema. This eluded me because I own a pretty good machine that heats the filter quickly after it has been attached to the machine.</p>

<p>The accuracy would depend on your machine. The result <em>could</em> be more crema, and everything that a fuller extraction entails. </p>

<p>Furthermore they are mentioning <em>""over 1000 aroma compounds""</em>. Do they dissolve?</p>

<p>All together, is a cup of coffee a solution or an emulsion? If it is a solution, is there such thing as a maximum saturation level for a cup of coffee?</p>
","<p>A cup of coffee is definitely a solution, in the sense that it is composed of dissolved solutes. The solvation occurs once water is introduced. While, there is always a limit to how much of a substance can be solvated in a given amount of solvent, with coffee you're likely to not reach the point of creating a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersaturation"">super-saturated solution</a> in normal conditions. If you were to take a pot of brewed coffee, and boil it, removing the solvent (water) you will likely reach a point as to where the solution is supersaturated, followed by precipitation of a crude extract.</p>

<p>Now is coffee an emulsion? I have heard that typical brewed coffee contains oils from the bean (likely oils that can be seen on darker roasts). If this is the case, then we could say that coffee is both a solution <em>and</em> an emulsion!</p>

<p>As an Italian desert, I believe that an Italian roast of some blend is best to match the rich mascarpone and alcohol tastes.</p>

<p>Is there a ""standard"" roast or blend combination?</p>
","<p>From a cooks perspective, I think it should be ""espresso"", or ""caffè"" not ""coffee"" in any good tiramisu recipe, which in turn would already suggest a type of beans and roast. </p>

<p>Note that the Italian term caffè denotes the strong black liquid you get from an esspesso machine or a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moka_pot"">moka</a>. </p>

<p>The coffee in a tiramisu has to be concentrated to supply enough flavour without soaking the ladyfingers or other bisquits used. (The same principle applies when you use a liquor.)</p>

<p>When choosing the beans /the roast, the same rule as for wine applies: Use what you drink. And seriously, unless you are making an insane amount of tiramisu, you will be using only very little of one pack of coffee.<br>
I use whatever I choose for my Espresso (if I feel rich, I'll splurge on something from my local roaster, in a pinch the usual suspects like Illy or Lavazza, sometimes even a Starbucks Espresso roast <em>cough</em>) and call it a day.</p>

I feel as if it is common knowledge that espresso coffee is superior to percolator coffee. Why is it different? What are the scientific reasons for this?</p>
","<p>Espresso tastes different than percolator coffee, but not necessarily better.  Espresso extraction produces a more concentrated drink with a different set of compounds that you would get with percolator extraction.  With a shorter extraction time and higher pressure, espresso will have a slightly different set of compounds than you would get from the same coffee with percolation.  </p>

<p>Some people prefer a more concentrated taste, however, some do not (many people think espresso is ""too strong"" when drank straight, thus the popularity here in the US of mixed espresso drinks).  This doesn't mean it's necessarily better.  Some types of beans are not well suited to espresso extraction and will actually produce a better cup when brewed with other methods.  </p>

<p>All coffee can be benefited or hindered by brew/prep method, but the quality of the bean and it's roast have quite a bit of influence in the matter.  Badly grown, processed and roasted coffee will not magically be made better by espresso extraction.  It might actually end up worse because concentrating it can highlight it's flaws.</p>

<p>Is there more to know about ""coffee silver skin""? For example, I wonder if all or part of the husk is part of it, and also why the term is ""silver"" (this could be a different question---please comment or ask it yourself).</p>
","<p>TL;DR Silver skin is recycled/re-purposed coffee skin also called <em>coffee chaff</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before coffee beans are roasted they contain about 11% internal
  moisture, if you look at a green (unroasted) coffee bean next to a
  roasted one you will notice the green bean is much smaller and has a
  thin skin, called silverskin or chaff.</p>
  
  <p>The heat of the roasting process converts the internal moisture into
  steam causing the skin to heat up and the bean to expand. When
  roasting is completed the chaff falls off and is removed from the
  roaster. Like coffee, chaff contains a high nitrogen content which
  makes it a valuable product for environmental purposes, and each roast
  produces about 3.2 pounds of chaff. As part of our commitment to
  consciously great coffee we have found a way to recycle the chaff from
  every roast instead of tossing it into the dumpster. Since 2008 we
  have partnered with a company called Reconserve that converts bulk
  food waste materials into animal feed and who’s guiding philosophy is:
  recycle, reprocess, resource conservation. Reconserve picks the chaff
  up from our roasting facility in Sacramento, blends it with other
  bakery byproducts, and produces a feed supplement for dairy cows. We
  currently produce about 4,000 pounds of chaff each month, this means
  since 2008 we have recycled about 320,000 pounds of chaff into feed
  for cattle. We take our commitment to sustainability seriously and
  make sure that we are constantly evaluating every step of our process
  to see where we can make improvements. When you purchase ecoGrounds
  coffees we want you to know you are choosing a high quality coffee

"Amount of milk in a macchiato beverage","1634","","<p>What is the correct amount of milk to put into a macchiato? Does it depend on the amount of espresso? </p>
","<p>The Italian word <em>macchiato</em> literally means ""marked"" or ""stained"" (related to the word ""immaculate"" [<a href=""http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=immaculate&amp;allowed_in_frame=0"">1</a>]), so really it is an indication to add a small quantity of the ""staining"" liquid, be it espresso or milk.</p>

<p>A <em>caffe macchiato</em> (also called <em>espresso macchiato</em>) is a shot of espresso (or two) with a ""stain"" of steamed milk and sometimes a little foam to indicate there is milk hiding under the espresso's <em>crema</em>.</p>

<p>A <em>latte macchiato</em> is the opposite concept, where steamed milk is ""stained"" by a shot of espresso.</p>

<p>As with any of these drinks, the variations are endless, so recipes and even ratios would be specific to a particular cafe.</p>

"Procedure for making a Caffe Americano","1613","","<p>When making a Caffe Americano, does it matter whether you put the hot water or espresso in first?  This is not a complicated drink to make, but I've seen it prepared both ways.</p>

<p>If it does matter, why does the order affect the taste of the coffee?</p>
","<p>Yes.  Adding water to Espresso is considered an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caff%C3%A8_Americano"">Americano</a>.  Doing it the other way around is called a Long Black.</p>

<p>According to that article and below sources, the Long Black preserves the crema, whereas the Americano preparation should not.  The manner in which the pour is done can contribute more to preserving or destroying the crema than the order.  An Americano should have no crema and the crema should be preserved in a Long Black.  It is the preservation or destruction of the crema that will affect the taste (and thus the pour) more than the order.</p>

"How long will cold brew keep?","1581","","<p>After making a big batch of cold brew, I'd like to be able to keep it around for an extended period of time-- one month, let's say. Assuming I keep it in an airtight container in the refrigerator, how long will my batch of cold brew remain fresh, flavorful and bacteria-free?</p>
","<p><strong>From anecdotal experience freshness and flavor begins to fade within ~7 days with regular storage methods</strong>. Many people brewing cold brew online state between 5 days and 2 weeks is okay to keep cold brew for. In my opinion you will have coffee that you won't want to drink long before you run into harmful bacteria <em>as long as you are keeping things sanitary</em>.</p>

<p><strong>How you store the coffee will determine how long it keeps</strong>.
To improve storage look into bottling it in individual bottles with little headspace, or even kegging the coffee. Exposing coffee to oxygen will negatively impact flavor and expose coffee to more bacteria. Creating a concentrate of the coffee may help to prevent bacteria from forming. Splitting batches up into multiple sterile containers and keeping them sealed may also help it to last longer. </p>

<p><strong>Getting your coffee to last you a full month is almost definitely going to be much more of a hassle than brewing coffee more frequently.</strong> The taste will always be better from fresher coffee and cold brewing coffee is one of the simplest methods. Unless you absolutely can't make coffee more frequently I would recommend making smaller batches you can consume quickly.</p>

"Why are lattes often served in big, wide cups?","1564","","<p>Lattes are often served in a cup that looks like this:</p>

I'm assuming it's the same here, so what is it about a latte that makes it suited for this shape of mug?</p>
","<p>It may be just me, but I think it has to do with aiming for a ratio of foam to liquid in each sip.</p>

<p>Basically a taller cylindrical cup with the same amount of foam on it would cause the first couple of sips to be mostly, if not entirely, foam. With a shorter wider cup you can have a lot of foam, but in a thinner layer, allowing for a more balanced sip and better mouth feel through the duration of the cup.</p>

"How much weight reduction occurs after roasting coffee beans?","1563","","<p>Does the roasting process lead to weight reduction? If so, what are determining factors? type of coffee? type of roast(dark, medium etc) ? </p>

<p>If you have X lbs of unroasted coffee beans, how much (average) roasted coffee beans you get after roasting?</p>
","<p>The roasting process leads to water loss in all types of beans. Most beans start off at about 10-12% moisture and end up around 3%.
My experience gives about 15% weight loss (shrinkage) for light roasts and around 20% on dark roast profiles.</p>

<p>Example of a dark roast weight loss in my roasterie would be: 
Starting weight: 240#
Roasted weight: 195#
Shrinkage = 195/240 = 81% of start weight so 19% loss.</p>

"When making a long black, how long should hot water cool before adding espresso before combining?","1521","","<p>A long black is made by pouring espresso into hot water-- effectively the reverse of an americano.</p>

<p>Is there an ideal amount of time, or an ideal temperature, at which the hot water should be allowed to cool to avoid burning the espresso during the combination process?</p>
","<p>As an American, I've never heard of a long black, but it sounds like a great idea. I normally drink brewed coffee black, but I enjoy an occasional Americano. The only problem is that they're generally served around 400,000° and I can barely hold them and have to wait hours for them to cool down enough to drink. Sometimes I ask for ice or something to cool it quickly. If I just wait for it to cool, it tends to taste rather old and stale by the time I can handle it. Or maybe I just can't taste it because my tongue is crispy from preliminary attempts. But the crema and freshness is always long gone.</p>

<p>I think that must secretly be the real reason for a long black—by adding the espresso to the top of drinkable-temperature water, you still have a chance at the best flavors and aromas. As <a href=""http://www.fivesenses.com.au/blog/2011/12/19/the-espresso-menu-explained"" rel=""nofollow"">the Australian coffee roasters Five Senses put it,</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Regardless of the crema, the long black tastes best as it cools slightly from boiling to a drinkable temperature. Only then will you be able to perceive some of the finer nuances and sweetness of the coffee.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, I would shoot to <strong>have the cup around the same temperature as good brewed coffee by the time it hits the drinker's lips</strong>. According to <a href=""http://www.coffeedetective.com/what-is-the-correct-temperature-for-serving-coffee.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Coffee Detective,</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[American-style brewed] coffee is best served at a temperature between 155ºF and 175ºF (70ºC to 80ºC). Most people prefer it towards the higher end, at about 175ºF.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That means, depending on cup type and ambient temperature, if you draw 200°F hot water from the machine before you start making the espresso and leave it uncovered, it will be roughly the right temperature to serve by the time the shots are ready.</p>

"How does pressure affect the flavor of espresso?","1520","","<p>I've noticed the water pressure from espresso machines varies from about 12 psi to 22 psi. What effect does this have on flavor? </p>
","<p>Working on a Synesso (prototype), I was lucky enough to be able to play with controlled pre-infusion. <a href=""http://www.fivesenses.com.au/blog/2014/06/19/pressure-profiling-using-the-synesso-hydra"" rel=""nofollow"">They state</a> that their pre-infusion has a pressure of 3-4 bars and "" bring[s] an extra textural element to your brew in the form of a greater volume of crema. It can also lead to a more syrupy mouth-feel overall."" I find this to be mostly true if the pre-infusion was used for about 5 seconds.</p>

<p>What I found through personal experience was that, if I kept the pressure consistent, not switching to the full 9 bars, the shot pulled at the same extraction rate, finishing at my desired time. So Keeping dose, time, and extraction the same, the only variable was pressure. I found that the most notable change was a <em>reduction in brightness.</em> The more pronounced acidity and citric flavors were <em>dulled</em>. There was however a silver-lining that gave the pre-infusion a redeeming quality: Because of the reduction in brightness, I found that when using <em>really fresh</em> coffee ( &lt; 4 days old), the pre-infusions reduction in brightness took away from the character metallic taste found with fresh coffee. For that reason, when I am dealing with fresh coffee, I may increase the pre-infusion time (from 5 to 9 seconds for example) and this helps make the espresso palatable. </p>

<p>There should be no problem with the white part. This is typical of washed coffee beans (vs. the ""natural"" beans that are, well, not washed, and the same part is then black).</p>

<p>Also, when grinding beans, there is production of chaff that does affect the taste of the final drink. This should be the light-coloured flecks you have noticed.

"How should I store whole bean coffee?","1480","","<p>I just got a pound of microroasted, local coffee and am curious what the optimal way to store it is (what temperature, humidity, etc)</p>
","<p><strong>In a cool, dark, dry, place and whenever possible vacuum sealed.</strong></p>

<p>The oils in roasted coffee degrade as they are exposed to air (oxidization) as well as heat. As with just about any foodstuff moisture accelerates the spoiling process as well. You should store your coffee in completely sealed, insulated, opaque containers. If you have the ability, vacuum pump the air out of the container for ultimate shelf-stability. Even without vacuum storage you can preserve beans for a long time by placing them inside a ziplock bag or coffee bag with a 1-way air seal and pushing as much air out as possible and then following the above method of airtight, dark and cool storage. Following these guidelines should help to ensure the freshness and flavor of the beans for as long as possible. </p>

"Does adding milk to coffee reduce it's antioxidant properties","1475","","<p>I heard this a while back, the milk binds with the antioxidant molecules of the coffee and renders them useless.

The individual compounds, (+)-catechin (60%), (-)-epicatechin (60%), kaempferol (33%) and quercetin-3-rutinoside (29%) decreased after 24h in the yoghurt made with the strawberry preparation. During the remaining period of storage these compounds increased by 47%, 6%, 4% and 18%, respectively. Pelargonidin-3-glucoside decreased 49% after 28 d. Immediately after the addition of the strawberry preparation to yoghurt, β-lactoglobulin decreased to values lower than the limit of detection and α-lactalbumin by approximately 34%, and was reduced further slowly throughout yoghurt self-life. An immediate interaction between the carrageenan present in the strawberry preparation and β-LG was observed. The variations of both polyphenols and protein in the presence of carrageenan and the potential interactions were discussed</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chlorogenic acids (CGA) are antioxidants found in coffee. They are becoming of interest for their health-promoting effects, but bioavailability in humans is not well understood. We hypothesized that adding whole milk or sugar and nondairy creamer to instant coffee might modulate the bioavailability of coffee phenolics. Nine healthy participants were asked to randomly drink, in a crossover design, instant coffee (Coffee); instant coffee and 10% whole milk (Milk); or instant coffee, sugar, and nondairy creamer already premixed (Sugar/NDC). All 3 treatments provided the same amount of total CGA (332 mg). Blood was collected for 12 h after ingestion and plasma samples treated using a liquid-liquid extraction method that included a full enzymatic cleavage to hydrolyze all CGA and conjugates into phenolic acid equivalents. Hence, we focused our liquid chromatography-Electrospray ionization-tandem MS detection and quantification on caffeic acid (CA), ferulic acid (FA), and isoferulic acid (iFA) equivalents. Compared with a regular black instant coffee, the addition of milk did not significantly alter the area under the curve (AUC), maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), or the time needed to reach Cmax (Tmax). The Cmax of CA and iFA were significantly lower and the Tmax of FA and iFA significantly longer for the Sugar/NDC group than for the Coffee group. However, the AUC did not significantly differ. As a conclusion, adding whole milk did not alter the overall bioavailability of coffee phenolic acids, whereas sugar and nondairy creamer affected the Tmax and Cmax but not the appearance of coffee phenolics in plasma.</p>

","<h1>Cold Brew Coffee - A Brief look at Flavor Profiles</h1>

<p>My company builds flavor profiling and quality control tools for the craft beverage industry, using machine learning, data science, and analytical chemistry - let's use some of our 20,000+ coffee reviews to answer this question with <strong>data</strong>.</p>

<p>It has been claimed for some time that cold brew as a method of extracting coffee only exists to minimize the amount of acidity in the flavor profile. This is only a third of the story, and may not be true for the coffee you brew or consume! </p>

<p>So what is the full story? Read on! </p>

<hr>

<h2>Acidity in Cold Brewed vs Hot Brewed Coffee</h2>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lVwmT.png"" alt=""Sour &amp; Acidity in Cold Vs Hot Brewed Coffee""></p>

<p>These two beautiful graphs show the difference in sour &amp; acidity in cold Vs hot brewed coffee. The graphs show that hot brewed coffee has a much larger range in the perception of acidity - and is on average <em>more</em> acidic than its cold brewed counter part. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Differences in Average Flavor Profile</h2>

<p>But what about the rest of the flavor profile? Are people really planning to cold brew for hours in advance just for marginally less sour acids in the brew? </p>

<p>No. Higher-end cafes and roasters are producing cold brew coffee to target consumers who want a different flavor profile- optimized for consumption at a different temperature. </p>

<p>For this section of the analysis, I will be using the Gastrograph to communicate complex flavor profiles consistently and simply. On the Gastrograph, the intensity is shown ranging from 0, the center of the graph, to 5 (the outer most point).  </p>

<p>Let's look at the difference in flavor profiles below: </p>

<p><strong>Full Immersion Cold Brew Coffee</strong>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BHdhv.png"" alt=""Average Cold Brew Full Immersion Coffee"">
This is the Gastrograph of the average Cold Brew Full Immersion Coffee. </p>

<p><strong>Full Immersion Hot Brew Coffee</strong>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NdOob.png"" alt=""Average Hot Brew Full Immersion Coffee"">
This is the Gastrograph of the average Hot Brew Full Immersion Coffee. </p>

<p>As you can see, these coffees differ on a much greater number of axis than simply sour and 
acidity - the goal is to make a different product with its own unique flavor profile, not to simply reduce acidity.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Differences in Flavor Profile by Brewing Method</h2>

<p>Finally, Cold Brew is actually an entire class of production methods that involve infusing coffee into cold water. There are 2 primary types: </p>

<p>(<strong>Reminder:</strong> Coffee brewed with hot water, and then iced is <em>not</em> Cold Brew coffee.) </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Full Immersion Cold Brew</p>

<ul>
<li>Fresh </li>
<li>CO2 Draft</li>
<li>Nitrogen Draft </li>
<li>Bottled </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Ice Drip </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Let's look at the 2 most interesting types of cold brews from the list above:</p>

<p><strong>Stumptown Draft Cold Brew</strong> </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xyNjr.png"" alt=""Cold Brew Draft"">
 This coffee is served from a beer keg and pressurized with CO2. </p>

<p><strong>Stumptown Nitro Cold Brew</strong> </p>

<p>This coffee is served from a beer keg and pressurized with nitrogen; the effect is a much smoother and fuller coffee, with a very thick and present mouth feel. 
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PR6CJ.png"" alt=""Nitro Cold Brew""></p>

<p>The cold brew coffee you make at home will be much closer to the average cold brew shown in the previous section, as I suspect few of the readers here will be making batches large enough to keg! </p>

<h3>Update: Very Short Chemical Analysis</h3>

<p><strong>How do the concentration of compounds salicylic acid, phenolic acids, and amino acids differ between cold brew and hot brewed coffee?</strong></p>

<p>It is not so much concentration that matters - it's perception. For example, phenolic acids are mostly volatile; in hot coffee more are evaporating, thus you can more easily perceive them. The same is true for salicylic acid (a precursor to aspirin, which is acetylsalicylic acid). </p>

<p>Also, These acids are more readily soluble and easier to extract in hotter environments. In cold brew not only do you extract fewer molecules of the acid, but the ones that you do extract will trigger a less potent olfactory response.</p>

<p>Amino acids are a trickier issue. The chemical nature of amino acids greatly varies (like in polarity and size, functional groups, etc). Most free amino groups will be consumed during roasting via Maillard non-enzymatic browning. On average, the cold brew would extract more, simply because it would have more time to come out of the coffee (during the average 6-hour steep time). </p>

","<p>I have a degree in chemical engineering and we do heat transfer and vaporization.  </p>

<p>Yes colder water that goes past the heating element and is not vaporized will have to be heated more. </p>

"Home Roasting with Fresh Roast SR500","1339","","<p>I've just purchased a Fresh Roast SR500 home roaster. I have no experience roasting coffee so I'm looking for some basic principles to guide my efforts. After two batches so far, the first, done according to the directions, was horribly undrinkable, and the second, while drinkable still wasn't very good.  The flavor is a somewhat bitter aftertaste. The coffee is described as a wet processed fruity Java bean. I have so many questions I'm not really sure where to begin. </p>

<p>After watching several YouTube videos it seems like every one is different. A professional roasters site advised the roasting time should be between 10 and 15 minutes for all roast levels. But that still leaves the question of how much heat and how to adjust that during the roast. </p>

<p>Are there any straightforward principles for how to adjust the roast in respone to the taste I've gotten from my first attempts?  Or any guidance on differences in roasting light vs Full City which would be the darkest I would do?  </p>

<p>I really don't want to reinvent the wheel here and waste a bunch of coffee beans in the process. </p>
","<p>I have been roasting with the FreshRoast SR 500 for several months and have seen wildly differing advice from a variety of sources.  Recently I found information from a few sources that when combined have resulted in some really nice roasts.</p>

<p>The first piece of information I found was the temperatures for the heat settings of the FreshRoast SR 500:</p>

<pre><code>|  Setting  |  Temp  |
| :-------- | :----- |
|  High     |  490   |
|  Medium   |  455   |
|  Low      |  390   |  
</code></pre>

<p>The second piece of information I found was the temperature at which coffee beans begin a process called pyrolysis.  At about 400 degrees Fahrenheit pyrolysis begins in coffee beans.  Pyrolysis is the process of chemical change within the bean that generates heat.  When this process happens in coffee we hear it as a popping sound known as first crack.</p>

<p>In the SR 500 a temperature setting of Medium is high enough to raise coffee beans to this temperature.  I had been using a high heat setting to roast coffee, and the resulting beans had a very smoky flavor, which was not very pleasant.</p>

<p>Additional research yielded some additional wisdom that I find sound.</p>

<pre><code>1. Apply adequate energy at the beginning of a roast
2. Make sure that the bean temperature progression always decelerates
3. Make sure that first crack begins at 75% to 80% of total roast time
</code></pre>

<p>This information is sound when trying to roast to a City or City+ level, which is fortunate for me as I am aiming for a nice medium roast for pour over coffee.</p>

<p>According to an information card I received from Sweet Maria's with my first order of coffee from them, city/city+ is achieved at the tail end of first crack at a temperature range of 415 to 435 degrees.</p>

<p>Applying adequate energy at the beginning of a roast is not the problem with the FreshRoast SR 500.  I find that the roaster applies too much energy and roasts much too fast.  If anything, I needed to find a way to slow down the drying phase, as the beginning of the roast is often called, and developed a procedure for stretching that out with this roaster.</p>

<p>I start by using an interval timer app on my tablet designed for use with interval training exercise to precisely time the steps in my process.  To slow down the initial drying process I alternate heating for twelve seconds and cooling for six seconds and repeat this cycle for twenty-four intervals.  The interval timer helps me remember what step I'm on and prompts me to switch the roaster from heating to cooling and back precisely.  During this phase I apply only low heat with the fan speed on high.  I also physically lift the roaster base and tilt the roaster several degrees away from vertical and rotate the roaster around its vertical axis.  This agitates the green beans in the chamber and helps prevent scorching.  I roast batches of 90 grams and find that this batch size also prevents scorched beans.</p>

<p>A decelerating temperature progression means that the rate of temperature rise should slow down during the roast.  It doesn't mean that the temperature should lower but that the rate of temperature increase should be faster earlier in the roast and slower later in the roast.  When the beans reach first crack there is a spike in bean temperature from the heat being generated internally by pyrolysis.  In anticipation of first crack and knowing that the roaster will not respond instantly to changes in heat settings, I lower the heat just prior to first crack.</p>

<p>The advice to make sure that first crack begins between 75% and 80% of total roast time is only a guideline, but I find that adhering to it gives me very nice coffee.  So with all of this information up front, here is how I apply it with the FreshRoast SR 500.</p>

<p>I begin by preheating the roaster using high heat and the fan control at the 3 O'clock position.  This allows all of the roaster parts to absorb as much heat as they can and prevents the roaster from sucking heat away from the beans.  I follow a set rhythm while roasting one 90-gram batch at a time.  While the beans are being cooled by the roaster after completing the roasting cycle I weigh out the next 90-gram batch.  When the roaster stops I immediately pour out the beans into a tray, turn the roaster back on using low heat and low fan speed, clean out the chaff collector, and load the next batch of beans into the roast chamber.</p>

<p>Preheat the roaster for 2 full cycles at a fan speed of 3 O'clock and using high heat.  Run the roaster on low heat and low fan speed between batches.</p>

<p>Start with a roast time of 2.8 minutes.  Roast 90 grams per batch.</p>

<pre><code>|  Description         |  Heat    |  Fan Speed  | 
| :------------------- | :------: | :---------: |
|  \*Drying Cycle      |  Low     |  High       |
|  @  1.9              |  Medium  |  1 O'clock  |
|  @  1.1 (FC) \*note  |  Low     |  ""          |
|  @  0.5              |  ""       |  3 O'clock  |
|  B4 End of FC        |  Cool    |  High       |
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Drying Cycle</em>: Alternate heating for 12 seconds and cooling for 6 seconds.  Tilt the roaster several degrees from its vertical axis and rotate it around that axis during this process.  Repeat this for twenty-four iterations.  Continue rotating the roaster until the first sign of first crack.</p></li>
<li><p><em>note</em>: Stop rotating the roaster at the first sign of first crack.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I'm sure there is plenty of room for improvement in my procedure.  Adding a thermocouple and noting the temperature during the roast would be very helpful in knowing what is happening while roasting.  Sweet Maria's sells one along with a battery and a temperature probe as a package that is cheaper than what Amazon will charge you for the same components.  It's about $30 from them.</p>

<p>I hope this helps either you or anyone else that might be looking for information for the FreshRoast SR 500.</p>

"Could preparation method make coffee more acidic?","1299","","<p>This is more of a vague feeling than something I'm sure of, but from the many cups I've drunk, I have a feeling that <strong>when prepared in a french press, my coffee tastes a little more sour/acidic, compared to a turkish brew. Is this a documented phenomenon</strong>, or is it just me? </p>

<p>Of course, assume the same coffee is used both times, which by the way is some home-ground (blade grinder) arabica.</p>
","<p>This is a perfect follow up to the ""<a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/66/what-coffees-are-the-least-acidic/181#181"">What coffees are the least acidic?</a>"" question! </p>

<p>As always, <strong>Lets answer it with some data!</strong> <a href=""http://Gastrograph.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">My company</a> uses machine learning, data science, and sensory science to build flavor profiling and quality control tools for the craft beverage industry. </p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Yes. Preparation has a significant affect on the flavor profile of coffee - including the level of acidity. </p>

<hr>

<h1>Distribution of Acidity by Brewing Method</h1>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bvYFi.png"" alt=""Boxplot of Sour &amp; Acidity by brewing method""></p>

<p>If I may present to you... the distribution of acidity in coffee by brewing method! 
Clearly and without surprise, Espresso (coffee extracted under pressure) is the most acidic preparation method, on average. French Press (full immersion brewing) is the least acidic, and V60 (a type of pour-over) has the widest range.</p>

<p><strong>But is there something else going on here?</strong> 
What if there exists a conflating factor such as green processing, roast level, or growing environment? Some of these questions we're already answered in the link above, so lets focused on the remaining question - how does the origin of the coffee effect the perceived acidity of the coffee by brewing method? </p>

<hr>

<h1>Acidity by Brewing Method Controlling for Continent of Origin</h1>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/mie4a.png"" alt=""Acidity by brewing method controlling for continent""></p>

<p>So is the effect of brewing method consistent? No. 
What we're seeing here is that each continent tends towards a different green processing technique, and thus a different optimal level of roast - all of which exert as much influence over the resulting level of acidity in the flavor profile of the coffee. </p>

<hr>

C is Country 
P is Preparation 
G is Green Processing

<p>Country is clearly the most used variable in creating this tree, and interestingly, Green Processing is only used as a splitting rule when a country has a variety of green processing methods in common use. </p>

"How to increase your caffeine sensitivity?","1296","","<p>I have been drinking coffee for a long time and over the last few years I've noticed that my sensitivity to caffeine has dropped significantly. Nowadays, it basically has no effect whatsoever - I can drink double espressos and go to sleep right away and I also don't feel anything after drinking multiples of those. According to this <a href=""http://www.caffeineinformer.com/caffeine-sensitivity"">http://www.caffeineinformer.com/caffeine-sensitivity</a> I guess that I've become hyposensitive to it (probably due to the abuse of all the coffee machines at my workplace)</p>

<p>It wasn't always like this - I even used to use it as a preworkout while I was studying (in large quantities, but still). <strong>My question is whether someone has had the same problem and managed to increase their sensitivity. If so, how and how long did it take?</strong> There are some tricks using grapefruit juice with coffee because of narangin which improves caffeine absorption or using fat (bulletproof coffee) for the same reason <a href=""https://www.bulletproofexec.com/the-4-secrets-of-getting-wired-on-caffeine/"">https://www.bulletproofexec.com/the-4-secrets-of-getting-wired-on-caffeine/</a> (I haven't tried these yet). The usual suggestion is to stop using it for a while, but after a month of doing so nothing changed. How do you get the kick back? I'm in the last year of my PhD and I need it...</p>
","<p>Over the years I developed a caffeine addiction that reached fairly severe levels.  For background, the addiction ramped into high gear the summer after my freshman year of college (summer of '99) when I was consuming somewhere between 60 and 100 ounces of coffee per day.  I tried to quit cold-turkey once, and spent two weeks mostly bouncing a rubber ball off the wall of my dorm room before I decided the addiction itself wasn't even that bad.</p>

<p>Eventually I needed to do something about it, and I went with the only logical method: I <strong>slowly</strong> backed down my consumption, from about five to seven cups per day at the time to a hard limit of two.  I also forced myself to stop consuming any coffee after about 11:00am.</p>

<p>I did all this over a six-week period.  That kept the headaches away, and decreased my dependence on the drug.  However, I had to maintain at that level for several more months -- probably about six or so -- for my sensitivity to caffeine to go back up.  Now, when I drink a cup in the morning, it has the desired effect: it perks me up and prepares me for my day.  It's no longer a crutch, it's simply a pick-me-up I enjoy.</p>

<p>In summary: back down your caffeine intake, whatever the delivery method you prefer, by 10 to 20 percent each week until you reach a more manageable level, then hold at that level for several months.  That will increase your sensitivity.</p>

"How can I improve this Chemex cold brew method?","1294","","<p>I do like my cold brewed coffee but it's difficult and inconvenient for me to make and keep in work due to the time it takes to steep, shared fridge space, etc. </p>

<p>I came across <a href=""http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/10/ristretto-on-the-rocks/?_r=0"">this method</a> recently...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The iced method isn’t complicated. Basically, you prepare brewed coffee as you normally would, only you use half hot water, half ice you put in the bottom of the vessel. The hot, fresh coffee drips directly onto ice so that it’s cool and ready to drink right away.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've now tried it a few times using my small chemex and a ratio of 2:1 (water to ice) rather than 50:50. I'm trying the pour over much more slowly than I normally would to maximise the extraction while using less water.</p>

<p>I can't really fault the taste, the flavour is still great, the finish is less acidic but obviously more watery. So while this method is indeed quick and uncomplicated I'm curious about 2 things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What else can I do to compensate for the extraction difference? I would really prefer it to be less watery.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I potentially going to crack the pot with the combination of hot and cold? I can't find any info on temperature variances on the Chemex site. </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Edited to add information...</strong></p>

<p>For a hot-brew I normally use  using 300ml hot water for 21g of grind. Here I'm using 200ml hot water in the pour over, to compensate for the 100g of ice that melts. </p>

<p>I'm taking 6-7 minutes with the pour. Normally I would take 3 minutes.</p>

<p>I'm making my grind slightly finer in order to extend time it takes the water to drip through. I would consider it to be medium-fine. </p>
","<p>What you're talking about is the ""Japanese iced coffee"" method, which is hot-water brew directly over ice. In contrast, cold-brew is using cold water in contact with the grounds. See techniques at other questions tagged as <a href=""/questions/tagged/cold-brew"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;cold-brew&#39;"" rel=""tag"">cold-brew</a>.</p>

<p><a href=""https://counterculturecoffee.com/learn/iced-coffee"" rel=""nofollow"">This article from Counter Culture</a>, also referenced in the article you linked, suggest Japanese iced as an <em>alternative</em> to cold brew. The articles suggest that directly brewing hot coffee over ice retains more of the volatile flavour compounds.</p>

<p>If you have had true cold-brew before, most methods use <em>several times</em> as much coffee grounds to brew as with other methods (some then dilute this with, e.g., water or milk). For example, normalized to a 200mL ""cup"" (~6.5 fl.oz.) of brewed coffee: Blue Bottle suggests about 3x more coffee for <a href=""https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/cold-brew"" rel=""nofollow"">cold brew</a> (45g per 200mL) than for <a href=""https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/drip"" rel=""nofollow"">drip</a> (14g per 200mL). If you're coming from that strength, it's no wonder you're finding it watery. </p>

<p>To your first question: If you want a stronger brew, why not <strong>simply use more coffee grounds</strong>? Your amount (21g grounds to 300g water+ice is about 14g/200mL cup) is already at the higher end of the spectrum for drip coffee; the industry standard is closer to 7g per cup/dose. But if you want it stronger, use more beans!</p>

<p>On your other question: <strong>this temperature change shouldn't be an issue.</strong> You said you're using a Chemex (e.g., <a href=""http://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com/three-cup-classic-series-coffeemaker.html"" rel=""nofollow"">classic 3-cup</a>) -- it is made from Pyrex brand <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borosilicate_glass"" rel=""nofollow"">borosilicate glass</a>, which has very good thermal shock properties. Even a lesser glass (e.g., non-tempered <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soda-lime_glass"" rel=""nofollow"">soda-lime glass</a>) shouldn't be a problem at these temperatures (slowly dripping boiling water onto ice). (However, for example, ice into glass at oven temperatures could <em>certainly</em> be a problem).</p>

"Which nespresso capsule has the most caffeine in it?","1284","","<p>I just got a Krups Nespresso capsules machine. I tried many capsules that come with the product as a demo.</p>

<p>Certainly, I liked almost all of the flavors. However, I need a capsule that has the highest level of caffeine in it. I tried Kaazar, like it very much, but I believe there are other capsules that deliver more caffeine.</p>

<p>Please help :)</p>
","<p>So.. I've done a lot of research on caffeine levels or at least reading various books that skirt the topic.  Interestingly, the caffeine amount in a particular roast is slightly different than most peoples conceptions, including my own up until a few months ago.</p>

<p>First off, caffeine levels in dark vs light roasts are often said to be different.  From a chemical perspective caffeine is chemically stable to 455 degrees Fahrenheit (it's melting point).  Due to this, caffeine is not removed during the roasting process unless you are roasting to a Spanish roast, or burned beyond all recognition.  As such, the caffeine inherit in a particular lot of green coffee tends to stay the same amount per bean regardless of roast depth.</p>

<p>The twist..</p>

<p>Roasting will roughly double bean size, and burn off between 12 and 18% of the total weight of a bean.  Due to this, technically, a darker roast has more caffeine by weight than a lighter roast, which is opposite of what I hear a lot of people say.</p>

<p>Now.. on to your question.. If the pods are by weight, I suppose a dark roast will have marginally more caffeine.  Where you get a significant difference in caffeine amounts is when you start looking at different types of coffee.  Robusta coffees for instance tend to be low grown and have adapted to the environment by having higher concentrations of caffeine.  The reason is simply that caffeine is the coffee plants natural pesticide.  That being said, Robusta coffees also tend to be very bitter, hence why they are predominantly used in cheap coffee blends in place of arabica.  The bitterness is directly related to the elevated caffeine, as well as very high concentrations of CGA.</p>

<p>My recommendation is pick what tastes good, because honestly, you aren't going to get a significantly higher amount of caffeine per roast, or lot of beans.</p>

<p>I'm wondering that they might have to use different types of filters. The types of filter might vary on the coffee maker. Some say that single cup coffee makers should only use paper filters (I don't know why) and others might have to use this type of coffee filter.</p>

<p>So my question is, do each of these have a certain filter you have to use with them or can they use multiple types?</p>
","<p>Due to the fact that this is a lengthy question, I will try to be concise and to the point.</p>

<p>In short, yes, all of these main types coffee makers use a different type or size of filter. Sometimes each type can use a different filter. I will provide a non-exhaustive list of filter types for these coffee makers which you have listed. Although the list in non-exhaustive, it will provide the main types of filters for each device.</p>

<h2>Understanding Permanent versus Paper filters</h2>

<p>A permanent filter is often made out of metal and is, in most cases, a mesh (not true for espresso machines). They are not disposable and are made to be reused many times.</p>

<p>An impermanent filter is generally made out of paper and is disposable and is generally not meant to be reused.</p>

<h2>Drip Coffee</h2>

<p>Drip Coffee machines are one of the most common coffee machines for home use. The filter used will either be paper or permanent.</p>

<p>A paper filter for the drip coffee machine will either be flat-bottom or cone-shaped depending on the make and model of the coffee machine.</p>

<p><strong>Flat-bottom filters:</strong></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YIiwu.jpg"" alt=""Flat-bottom Filter""></p>

<p><strong>Cone shaped filter:</strong></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ntWce.jpg"" alt=""Cone shaped filter""></p>

<p>The permanent filter can take the same shapes, however it is generally a flat-bottom shape yet can be a hybrid between a cone shaped and a flat-bottom shaped filter. I can only describe this as an upside down triangular prism. Below is a picture of the aforementioned hybrid filter.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CvRrn.png"" alt=""Hybrid cone filter""></p>

<h2>Single Cup</h2>

<p>These filters are generally made out of paper and are usually a cone shape which is usually specific/unique to the type of single cup brewing device.</p>

<h2>French (Push) Press</h2>

<p>A french or push uses a permanent filter which is made out of a fine metal mesh. It is on the bottom of the plunger. The entire bottom of the filter has three main parts, shown below.</p>

<p><strong>The Parts of a French Press Filter:</strong></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xrAHF.jpg"" alt=""French Press Filter Parts""></p>

<h2>Espresso Machine</h2>

<p>An espresso machine's filter is called a portafilter. It shaped like a small basket, made out of metal, and has small holes in the metal on the bottom. There are three sizes. The most common are the single and double shot filters and a rarer one is the triple shot filter. They increase in size to hold more ground coffee.</p>

<p>There are generally three types of portafilters in circulation with mainstream home espresso machines.</p>

<ol>
<li>Single wall. This is the most common in the industrial setting. It is contains only one wall on the bottom of the filter.</li>
<li>Double wall. Think about this as a portafilter for the inexperienced and is most common for the home espresso machine. It has a secondary wall on the bottom of the portafilter with only a few holes in it. The presence of two walls helps to regulate extraction pressure and is therefore good for those who are not very good at tamping pressure and grind size.</li>
<li>Pod filter. This is simply a specially designed filter that is the same shape as the others and comes with some home espresso machines. They are used to hold pre-made and pre-packaged espresso pods that one simply drops into the filter and can avoid many of the other steps of traditional espresso brewing such as tamping and grinding.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Double Espresso or twice the amount of coffee and twice the amount of water.  Basically it describes two shots of espresso in one demitasse container.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Is there any difference between the two if they're both double shots of espresso served in a glass container?  Or is a short black a technical term referring to a specific ratio of coffee to water?</p>
","<p>As far as I know, a short black is a <em>single</em> espresso, as in it's literally just another word for a single espresso. A short black is a single 30ml shot, and a doppio is two, 60ml. Nothing added to either, and the vessel you're serving it in varies by where you are, and doesn't change the name in any case :-)</p>

"Is it possible to regrind beans?","1187","","<p>Is it possible to regrind beans?</p>

<p>I have about half a bag of very nice coffee in a semi-coarse grind, and I want to use a brew method (Melitta cone) that's more appropriate for a medium-coarse grind.</p>
","<p>This is a pretty good way to ruin a burr grinder. Worst case scenario, your burrs jam up so much that they can't spin and burn out your motor. A blade could help, but I'd argue that the inconsistent grind you'd get wouldn't be much of an improvement in cup quality anyway. Realistically you'd end up with some of your grinds unchanged, some at the size you want and some ground to dust. The different sized particles would extract unevenly and the dust is likely to clog the filter.</p>

<p>That said, you're not going to break a blade grinder by regrinding, so give it a shot and see how you like the results. At most you're out 20-50g of coffee.</p>
","1771"
"Should I thoroughly clean the portafilter basket between shots?","1185","","<p>When I'm making lots of individual drinks I tend to clean the portafilter basket thoroughly and then dry it before filling it again etc. </p>

<p>I've watched baristas and they tend to just knock the old coffee out and immediately refil the portafilter without cleaning. I'd have thought that this would create bitter coffee as the grounds will already have been through one extraction.</p>

<p>Is it accepted that you should clean the portafilter between shots, or is it ok to reuse?</p>
","<p>There's a trade-off here. If you're working in a fast-paced coffee shop, you're likely to favour the faster option (knock out the coffee) over cleaning. Generally knocking out the coffee will get rid of >99% of the grounds from the previous pull, so the impact on the flavour of the next one will be so slight as to be unnoticeable. Usually the portafilter won't even have time to dry out, so the coffee won't dry on and clog up the portafilter.</p>

<p>If you're making multiple coffees one after another, reusing the portafilter is probably acceptable.</p>

<p>However if you're leaving the coffee machine alone, it's best to at least rinse out the portafilter before you (or the next person) comes to use it. Once the grounds/coffee start to dry, it'll clog up and be much harder to clean further down the line.</p>

"How can I make french press coffee taste less acidic?","1100","","<p>Is there a trick to making coffee, particularly french press, taste less acidic? </p>
","<p>Without any more specific information about the coffee you use and what recipe you use for the french press, we won't be able to give you a specific answer with a solution to your problem. However too acidic probably means that your coffee is underextracted. That means the water hasn't had enough time or wasn't hot enough to extract the flavor compounds you want out of the ground coffee.</p>

<p>There are a few variables that will influence extraction with french press. I already mentioned time and heat. A recipe that I have used with very good results is 6g coffee per 100ml of water, ground to the size of coarse salt with a steep time of 4min. At first you only add a little water (just off the boil), twice to three times the weight of coffee grounds and let sit for 1min. Then give it a stir (there will be grounds on the top forming a crust), add the rest of the water and wait until 4min. Plunge and immediately transfer your coffee to a preheated vessel, either your mugs or a jug. Important here is that you don't let the coffee sit as it will continue to extract and taste bitter after a few minutes.</p>

<p>This should give you an even, full bodied extraction. If you feel like it's still too acidic, you could vary the variables involved. If you grind slightly finer the extraction will be higher. Same thing if you increase the brew time a bit. I suggest you just play around and keep in mind that these variables are not independent of each other. Finer grind means faster extraction for example. With a basic understanding of how extraction works you should get the hang of it quickly.</p>

<p>If the coffee still tastes too acidic although you have tried all suggestions check if the roast is too light, since light roasts tend to have more acidity. Also the origin of your coffee is a factor, african coffees (there are many different regions and processing methods so this is a big generalization) tend to be more acidic, while sumatran coffees are considered the least acidic. Central and South American coffees will often have acidity levels in the middle range.
It might also be sour because the coffee is stale (around 4 weeks after roasting for whole beans, much much much faster for preground) or it might just be shitty coffee.</p>

"Why must the milk be frothed?","1076","","<p>Nearly every coffee machine has the milk go through this device which not only heats it up but causes it to froth up.</p>

<p>Why is this important for a coffee? What's wrong with just heated milk?</p>
","<p>When heating milk with steam, aerating the milk (the process of drawing in air which creates foam) is essential to allow the milk to heat gently, without scalding. If you're using some other heating process, you'll have to take care of preventing scalding in some (other) way.</p>

<p>An extra benefit of foam &mdash; particularly <em>microfoam</em> where the bubbles are too small to see &mdash; is that it changes the surface tension of the liquid beverage, potentially allowing more taste-buds to come into surface contact. So you get <em>more flavor</em> bio-chemically. As (good) baristas know, tiny bubbles taste better than big ol' <em>soap bubbles</em>. This theory explains why.</p>

"What factors determine coffee bean size?","1069","","<p>I bought a bag of Guatemala/Colombia/Ethiopia blend after having single origin Peru beans (all Arabica), and was struck by the difference in bean size: Peruvian beans were almost twice larger than the beans in the blend.</p>

<p>Now I'm wondering whether the difference is conditioned by some environmental factors, or regional differences of the coffee plant, or the timing of harvesting. Of course, it can also be that any coffee plant anywhere produces beans of (significantly) different size, and then they are sorted into size-consistent batches (as per <a href=""http://www.thecoffeeguide.org/coffee-guide/coffee-quality/bean-size/"">this guide</a>, for instance).</p>
","<p>The single biggest factor in the size of a coffee bean is the botanical variety of the plant. There is no amount of nutrition or growing conditions that can overcome the effect of genetics.  </p>

<p>In this picture from our garden at Coffea Diversa you can see two examples at the extreme. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>On one hand you have mokka, this variety has the smallest bean of all
coffee varieties. </p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand you have Maragogype, this variety has the largest
bean of all coffee varieties.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There is no amount of fertilizer that you can give to a mokka grain to make it even come close to the size of a ripe Maragogype bean (and viceversa). </p>

<p>The difference in sizes between your blend and peruvian coffees are probably due to the botanical varieties of the beans. </p>

"What are the cheapest options for making good quality espresso at home?","1047","","<p>I have always wanted to add espresso to my coffee creations in the morning, but am a novice and don't know where to begin. </p>
","<p>It is slightly dependent on your <em>personal</em> definition of espresso. Also the choice depends on how easy you want its operation to be.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/06/how-to-use-a-moka-pot-stovetop-espresso-tips.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>moka pot</strong></a> is certainly the cheapest espresso-type device. However, it doesn't fall within the standards of a true Italian espresso, as pointed out in <a href=""http://%20https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/298/277"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this answer</a>. In particular, you won't have any crema.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.wacaco.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>Hand pumps</strong></a> are inexpensive, compact and light, and have the decent pressure of 8 bars. Although they are marketed as an espresso device for camping, they can be use wherever you have hot water.</p>

<p>A step up for home is an <a href=""http://www.aerobie.com/product/aeropress/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>aeropress</strong></a>. The way it operates is steep + push-filter (as in a French press), and the result ranges from filter-brew-like to espresso-like.</p>

<p>Next in price are probably <strong>the capsule espresso machines</strong> (such as Nespresso and its clones), which many supermarket chains have cheap versions of. Very easy to use, but unsustainable (see <a href=""https://sustainability.stackexchange.com/q/2501/2661"">here</a> and in the end of <a href=""https://www.choice.com.au/food-and-drink/drinks/tea-and-coffee/articles/coffee-capsules"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>), and coffee enthusiasts won't consider them an option because of the taste (see the previous link). For related concerns, see the (excellent) answer to <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/1572/277"">this question</a>.</p>

<p>And then come two best types: <strong>bean-to-cup</strong> and traditional <strong>espresso machines</strong> with a manually operated portafilter. They both are discussed in <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/333/277"">this answer</a>. Both vary in price and quality significantly; probably a decent traditional machine may have a lower starting price than bean-to-cup machine.

"How do I make that frothy milk that coffee shops use to make lattes?","1041","","<p>What are my options for milk frothing? From what I can tell, baristas just use part of the ""big coffee machine"" (please excuse my rookie terminology; my national drink is tea :D) and don't have a separate device for it.</p>

<p>I'm only an occasional coffee drinker, so I don't want to invest in something that costs $100 just to froth milk.</p>

<p>A full answer with all the possible answers ranging from perfect but expensive to inferior but cheap would be best.</p>
","<p>They aren't <em>just</em> frothing the milk, they're also <em>stretching</em> the milk. Stretching it is what gives a latte its unique texture (though the micro bubbles add to that). If you want a good latte, focus first on stretching it - you can use a small whisk to get air into the milk if need be.</p>

<p>You want a small stainless steel pitcher, most look like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bnlis.jpg"" alt=""pitcher""></p>

<p>Put 2/3 of the amount of <em>cold</em> milk you actually want in your latte in that, then put it on a heat source (small burner is okay). Hold your hand around the pitcher while it heats, and use the other hand to stir the milk. You can also use one hand and just swirl the milk around in the pitcher - do what feels comfortable, just keep the milk moving. </p>

<p>As soon as the pitcher becomes <em>just less</em> than too hot for your hand, pull it. Swirl it around a little bit and look inside. Does the milk have a kind of gloss to it similar to Elmer's glue (or any other paste you used in school)? If not, Put it back on the heat for 20 - 30 seconds, swirling it as you do. Once it's got that gloss, and the milk has expanded a bit, it's stretched properly.</p>

<p>An electric burner is ideal for this, but there are also metal overlays for gas burners that just provide a hot surface.</p>

<p>At that point you can use a hand whisk, or any number of the frothing gadgets that you can find in any cooking store (brick-and-mortar or online). </p>

<p>You can, of course, just froth the milk, but what you're essentially doing is aerating it. That's fine, it's going to make a tasty drink, but it might fall short of your expectations if you don't <em>stretch</em> the milk as well. The process is what makes the milk and the coffee fall in love and give birth to a latte.</p>

<p>The steam wand on espresso machines heats the milk <em>and</em> adds the air, giving you a lot more control over the process. However, this will work almost as well. </p>

<p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Don't ever let the milk get close to simmering. It'll burn very quickly. </li>
<li>Use the handle if you have to put the pitcher back on the heat (as naturally, you took it off because it was approaching too hot to hold)</li>
<li>You want to get the milk <em>in</em> the coffee as soon as possible once it has that gloss. Don't let it cool down too much while frothing (work fast)</li>
<li>It's going to take some practice</li>
</ul>

<p>Total for this would be about $15 for the stainless steel pitcher, $10 - $15 for the frother, so all total around 30 bucks. You could use a sauce pan, but it's <em>much</em> harder to gauge how hot the milk is if you do, and much harder to control when you pour. </p>

"Does the hardness of water matter when making coffee?","1033","","<p>I live in a hard water area and when brewing English Tea I can <em>definitely</em> taste and see the difference when compared to where I'm from, which is a soft water area.</p>

<p><strong>Does the hardness of the water matter when making coffee, too?</strong></p>

<p>For instance, whether or not the taste is more or less intense depending on the hardness of the water. I haven't noticed but I would think it does affect the flavor.</p>

<p>I'd be interested in a <strong>scientific/objective view</strong>. As of now, I use bottled water in my kettle.</p>
","<p><strong>Yes.</strong></p>

<p>That is to say it will definitely affect flavor, but how it affects the flavor is ultimately dependent upon the specific mineral compounds found in your hard water vs. other hard waters and soft water's lack of these compounds. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here's the key: Some of the compounds in hard water are ""sticky,"" glomming onto certain compounds in coffee when they meet (in your coffeemaker). The more eugenol the water hangs on to, for example, the woodsier the taste of your coffee will be. </p>
  
  <p>Magnesium is particularly sticky, meaning water that's high in magnesium will make coffee with a stronger flavor (and higher levels of caffeine). Hard water can also have high levels of bicarbonate, though, which Hendon found could lead to more bitter flavors coming through.  - A Chemist Has Uncovered A Secret To Brewing Delicious Coffee At Home <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/a-chemist-has-uncovered-a-secret-to-delicious-coffee-2014-6#ixzz3Q3ecJSgz""><em>Business Insider</em></a>. </p>

"Reduce power of popcorn popper for roasting coffee","1024","","<p>I've been roasting coffee for a couple of years now, and I've always used a popcorn popper.  I'm interested in taking things a bit more seriously and would like to be a bit more meticulous when it comes to roast level.  I find that my popcorn popper (1200 W) roasts coffee a little too quickly, to the point that it becomes difficult to get a precise and consistent roast level from time to time.  Does anyone know of anyway that I could reduce the power of the roaster?  If it roasted at a lightly slower pace I feel like I would have better control over the process.  I've heard people suggest plugging it in through an extension cord or a power strip, which will reduce the power going to the popper.  Is there a more principled or controlled way of doing this?  Some sort of device that goes in between the popcorn popper plug and the outlet that would let me adjust the power at a fine granularity would be ideal.  Does this sort of technology exist?  Perhaps a sort of light switch dimmer would work?</p>
","<p>Rather than playing with electricity and wiring you could actually just move the roasting bed/area away from your heat source and accomplish close to the same thing.  </p>

<p>I started roasting with a popper as well.  The hole in the popper was roughly 3 inches so I got a 3 to 4 inch duct adapter, a 4 inch flour sifter and mushed it all together, similar to <a href=""http://207.66.12.210/CoffeeRoasting/3CupSetup.jpg"">this</a>.  The result was that I moved the coffee away from the heat source.  The sifter also allows you to stir and get more even results.  I think I went from 4 to 5 minute roast time to 7 or 8 minutes with this method and the parts were very cheap. </p>

<p>I believe the <a href=""http://www.sweetmariascoffee.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=25&amp;t=5331&amp;start=20"">forum post</a> for that picture actually has additional mods close to what you may be looking for if you actually want to take your popper apart and try rewiring it.</p>

"Should I use the airtight container, or the opaque container?","981","","<p>I know that ideally, I should keep my ground coffee in an airtight, opaque container.</p>

<p>Currently, I'm limited to one that is airtight, but glass, and one that is opaque, but not that airtight (it's actually a bag with a zip seal).</p>

<p>While I get around to getting a decent new container, which is the best to keep my ground coffee in?</p>
","<p><strong>I value <em>sealed</em> over <em>opaque</em>.</strong> Go for the sealed glass. <em>Opaque</em> is not really the goal, but rather <em>in the dark</em>. Keeping the stuff in a dark location, even in a clear container, will be fine.</p>

<p>As far as priorities for storage in general, <a href=""http://www.ncausa.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=70"">according to the USA National Coffee Association</a> (and others including <a href=""https://bluebottlecoffee.com/frequency/store-coffee?tonx=1"">Blue Bottle</a> and a <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2010/10/the-coffee-storage-conundrum-how-to-keep-beans-fresh/64118/"">lengthy missive from The Atlantic</a>), there are <strong><em>four things</em></strong> that are most important for coffee freshness; that is, <strong><em>minimizing exposure</em></strong> to the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>air</li>
<li>moisture</li>
<li>heat</li>
<li>light</li>
</ol>

<p>... <em>in that order</em>, according to NCAUSA (first link above). That is, keep it <strong><em>sealed</em></strong> (minimizing airflow and humidity, most important), <strong><em>cool</em></strong> (but not cold/refrigerated), and <strong><em>in the dark</em></strong> (somewhat less important). The best place to do this is in an airtight container in a dark, cool pantry. If kept in a dark place, you don't even need to make the container opaque. Lastly, the ""light"" factor is the lowest in priority, so ""mostly dark"" is probably good enough.</p>

<p>I tend to re-use coffee containers for this purpose (I have a bunch of <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B001E5DYTO"">illy cans such as these</a> that work well, are a good size, and have a one-way valve on the bottom). Once you buy the coffee, the tins are ""free""!</p>

Is this okay, health-wise (surely flavour will be affected a bit) especially since I'm using it everyday, anyway?</p>

<p>Of course when I stop using my dripper for a while, there would be molds in the filter and that prompts me to soap and give it a hot bath. </p>
","<p>Looks like a standard metal mesh reusable filter! The mesh is probably stainless steel, perhaps with a gold-tinted coating, sandwiched between a plastic frame. They're alternatives to paper filters for filter/drip coffee. I find the outcome to be a little gritty/grainy; more like French press than a regular paper filter.</p>

<p>In general, if your filter is still performing well, I think <strong>you're probably fine with a shake-out, rinse, or occasional scrub</strong>. However, <strong>any residue might impart off-tastes in your next brew</strong> (hopefully what's left is just coffee remnants!). The leftover coffee stuck to your filter (that you didn't wash off) will oxidise, taste stale, etc. (See also <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/123/262"">this question about coffee going stale</a> -- one answer says it only takes minutes! And <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/160/262"">this question about what's happening</a> with stale coffee.)</p>

<p><strong>Wet coffee grounds will mould if allowed to sit too long</strong> as you report. So if you leave coffee in it, very wet, for a long time, you might be inviting flora and fauna that you don't want. You reported this in your question, but I'm surprised if it would happen very quickly. Clearly, when you have mould growing, you'll want to give it a good scrub. If you store your filter (grounds knocked out, even if not washed) in such a way that the filter can dry out more quickly (e.g., hanging, separate from the coffee maker, propped up to permit air flow, etc.) it seems that mould would have a harder time to grow.</p>

<p>As for getting clogged and occasionally needing a really thorough cleaning... I use a similar device for brewing tea, and it gets clogged sometimes. In fact, I wrote <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/51953/25286"">this question/answer on Cooking.SE</a> recently about how it had become clogged after a decade of use; see that for more on how to get such a metal mesh really clean.</p>

","<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MzlPd.png"" alt=""THIS SHOULD HELP :)""></p>

<ul>
<li>One reason that the taste isn't as good for Robusta is that it has more caffeine compared to Arabica. Which may sound like a positive thing but caffeine carries a bitter taste which makes it an unpleasant drink. In fact the Robusta bean has 2.7% caffeine content, almost double the 1.5% of Arabica.</li>
<li>Arabica contains almost 60% more lipids and almost twice the concentration of sugar than Robusta. This factor also probably has a big impact on why we prefer the taste of Arabica.</li>
<li>From a price perspective, green beans of Robusta is about half the price of Arabica green beans on the commodity market.</li>
<li>Robusta is easier to tend to on the farm, has a higher yield and is less sensitive to insects - the extra caffeine is a chemical defense for the coffee seed as the quantity in the Robusta is toxic to bugs.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these factors help bring up the supply and lower the input costs for farmers to produce. With this more attractive price point, a lot of roasters back in the day would add Robusta to their blend in an attempt to reduce their costs and increase their profits. When coffee was initially sold in the 1900s the quality of coffee slowly and slowly deteriorated in an effort for companies to squeeze the most profit.  </p>

<p>Where you’ll find it: Nowadays, it’s not often you’ll find Robusta in a coffee blends or in coffee shop. If you’re drinking instant coffee? Well, that’s probably all Robusta… but you probably don’t care very much about taste. In your espresso blend? That’s a mixed bag. Literally. Oddly enough, Robusta is still widely used as part of espresso blends – specifically Italian style blends. <em>It is said to help improve</em> the <strong>crema</strong>. 
One thing to note is despite the association with Arabica of being higher quality, and Robusta as being lower quality, it’s not always the case. Top notch specialty Robusta coffee will usually taste as good as or better than low end Arabica. However, high end Robusta isn’t widely used or available. Rather, Robusta is usually used as a filler or cost reducer. </p>

<ul>
<li>Robusta beans are much more circular, whereas Arabica are more oval.</li>
<li>Chlorogenic acid is a significant antioxidant and an insect deterrent. Robusta is 7-10% CGA and Arabica has 5.5-8% CGA.</li>

  <p>Degassing varies depending on the type of coffee and roast. It therefore can take anywhere from 2 to 12 days until the coffee is ready to brew. Some rules of thumb:</p>
  
  <p>The first 24 hours is when a bulk (approximately 40%) of CO2 leaves the bean.</p>
  
  <p>Darker roasts usually degas faster than lighter roasts</p>
  
  <p>Longer roasts usually degas faster than faster roasts.</p>

In that same vein, I'd like to know the best way to store ground coffee to preserve freshness. Should ambient temperature and humidity be considered?</p>
","<p>In general, it's best to <em>not</em> store ground coffee. If quality really matters, then the real answer is to back up. Try to grind only enough coffee for what you're using immediately to brew with. If you're buying preground coffee, then storage and optimal quality become somewhat trivial.</p>

<p>Once the surface area of the coffee is increased (by grinding it), the majority of the coffee is exposed to air, accelerates the decomposition of the coffee, meaning it likely isn't going to stay fresh for long anyway. Think of it like opening a dry, red wine. Since it's been opened, it's going to turn faster than it being left in the bottle because it's been exposed to atmosphere.</p>

<p>So in short, if flavor and freshness really matter, try not to <em>store</em> ground coffee if at all possible.  </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>If you really <strong>must</strong> store ground coffee, keep it sealed airtight. The exposure to atmosphere is going to be the strongest catalyst in making your coffee less than fresh.</p>

"Why are commercial coffee machines significantly more expensive than consumer machines?","922","","<p>I am trying to understand what causes a commercial coffee machine to be more expensive than a consumer system.</p>

<p>In essence, a coffee machine consists of:</p>

<ol>
<li>Boiler, for the hot water (around 65 °C).</li>
<li>Temperature sensor.</li>
<li>Pump/motor to get the pressure (around 10 bar). (cost: \$390-\$520 USD)</li>
<li>Valves and pipes (to the boiler, from boiler to extraction point).</li>
<li>Pressure gauge, for the coffee extraction . </li>
<li>Relay, measuring the extraction length (around 25 sec).</li>
<li>Precise Temperature, Pressure and Extraction-Time control, via some kind of embedded system, say micro controller.</li>
<li>Chassis, to hold all the parts.</li>
<li>Coffee Taste(Temperature, Pressure, Extration-Time, Coffee Beam Crop) </li>
</ol>

<p>What is it about the components or implementation that make commercial systems more expensive?</p>

<p>Is there something different about the manufacturing process (and therefore price) of each of the separate components?  Or are there additional electrical components contributing to a higher component price? </p>
","<p><em>Disclaimer:</em> I have no coffee maker designing or manufacturing experience.  This answer is based on internet research and professional experience.  This answer addresses some of the product design challenges and less of the real engineering challenges, but a lead into the engineering challenges. Based on the question and comment I believe OP is interested in designing a coffee maker.</p>

<p>From a business standpoint most organizations strive to service segments of the market that organizations believe they have a competitive advantage. These organizations also try to offer products to meet opening (OPP), mid (MPP) and High (HPP) price points. Also branding place a significant part in product pricing. </p>

<p>Assumption: US dollar = Euro (Approximately, 1 Euro = 1.09 US$) </p>

<p><strong>Coffee Maker Product Landscape</strong><br>
Based on the above I did some research on <a href=""http://www.foodservicewarehouse.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">food services warehouse</a> and selected Grindmaster for this analysis. Base on list price following are the price point classification (Dollars $)</p>

<ul>
<li>OPP: 1000 - 2600</li>
<li>MPP: 3500 - 4700</li>
<li>HPP: 6000 - 10,000</li>
</ul>

<p>Below is a table for OPP, MPP, and HPP price segmentation (April 6th, 2015)</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zRxCv.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zRxCvm.jpg"" alt=""Price segmentation""></a></p>

<p>Lets assume the following as customer segments</p>

<ul>
<li>OPP: Small office break room coffee machine</li>
<li>MPP: Large office cafeteria</li>
<li>HPP: High traffic coffee shop, Panera, Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts…</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Requirements Analysis:</strong><br>
Flow rate was chosen to keep the analysis simple</p>

<ul>
<li>OPP:  4 - 15 gl/hr</li>
<li>MPP: 15 - 32 gl/hr</li>
<li>HPP:  32 - 50 gl/hr</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Engineering Analysis</strong></p>

<p><strong>Product Design</strong><br>
Consider the Motor (Rotor, Stator, Casting) or the heating element from the BOM. Each of the price points (PP) most like need a different type of component. The component price to meet the above flow rate specification can be significantly different. Also the product volume is each PP is different thus for HPP or even MPP product it is highly unlikely to obtain volume base pricing that OPP might enjoy. Thus explains the cost of components.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nLImt.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nLImtm.jpg"" alt=""Example BOM for  coffee Maker""></a></p>

<p><strong>Product Testing, Validation and Manufacturing</strong><br>
The cost of testing, validation and manufacturing will be much higher for MPP and HPP product because the consumer demands for higher quality product compared to OPP products.  Thus the non-recurring engineering (NRE) cost per machine will much higher for MPP and HPP product than the OPP products.</p>

<p><strong>Product Serviceability and Support</strong><br>
An OPP price point product needs very little from a serviceability and after sale support compared to MPP or HPP product. An OPP customer is most likely replace a defective coffee maker with a new coffee make where is MPP or HPP customer will consider maintenance. Also consider a customer like Starbuck or Panera, they demand for high quality, and zero downtime. Therefore the components used in MPP or HPP coffee makers of significantly higher quality than the OPP coffee makers.  </p>

<p>Product Pricing VS BOM price -> General rule of thumb is BOM cost is 1/5 the Product Price. I believe this is a good starting point to figure what take to compete in the intended the coffee maker market. It appears that the coffee maker market is a red ocean. Therefore it important identify the point of differentiation. </p>

<p>The question is: how are caffeine pills made, are they produced using synthesized caffeine, how much of a chemistry is involved, is caffeine extracted during decaf process used?</p>

<p>If this is a wrong SE community please guide me to right one where I'm most likely to get an answer (preferably with links).</p>
","<p>Caffeine is almost always created as a byproduct of the decaffeination process.</p>

<p>It IS possible to synthesize caffeine. The most popular lab synthesis (1,3-dimethylurea and ethyl 2-cyanoacetate) requires multiple steps, and generally more steps means more expensive. </p>

<p>Luckily, there is a huge demand for decaffeinated coffee. The bonus is exactly as you expected; these processes generate both decaf coffee and caffeine as a by-product, that can then be repackaged or sold in other products.
Historically, decaffeination was done with organic solvent extraction (chloroform and dichloromethane being really common), but today is is usually done with the swiss water process (I suspect this is what ends up in pills and added caffeine consumer goods) or supercritical fluid extraction (which is more energy intensive, but can lead to a higher quality product that is often purchased by laboratories and scientific researchers who use it as part of their experiments).</p>

","<p>With instant coffee, you are not ""practically eating the beans;"" you are drinking reconstituted dried <em>coffee.</em></p>

<p>To create <em>instant coffee</em> granules, the manufacturer first brews the coffee using conventional methods and then either freeze-dries or spray-dries the coffee to create a soluble powder form. Dried coffee.</p>

<p>The amount of caffeine in the instant coffee will depend largely the original brewing process. Since commercial instant coffee is created in very large volumes, they are likely extracting coffee faster than our meticulous home-brewed methods. So while caffeine is water soluble, it takes <em>more</em> time for the caffeine to be extracted and absorbed in the water than other compounds. And ""more time"" is <strong><em>not</em></strong> something that the mass-produced instant process allows. Less extraction time = less caffeine.</p>

"How best to reduce tannins in black coffee?","903","","<p>I've traditionally had coffee with milk, no sugar. However I've recently switched to a diet that involves either reducing milk intake or switching to a milk substitute.</p>

But assuming you don't want to add anything to your straight black coffee, I would change what you have control over. Brewing method and coffee.</p>

<p>Cold brewing reduces acids extracted from the coffee, which reduces bitterness. AeroPress brewing extracts less than most other hot methods like a french press.</p>

<p>For coffee, try out light roast or medium roast coffees, as these will have less tannins. You should also try out dry-processed vs wet-processed coffees, as those methods introduce different flavors to the coffee. Most dry-processed coffee will have a more stone fruity flavor due the the sweet cascara fruit flesh drying onto the beans.</p>

"Does storing coffee in a freezer preserve freshness?","890","","<p>Does storing ground coffee in a freezer make it stay fresh longer? If so, how long will it remain fresh? </p>
","<p>No. In fact it's likely to make your coffee taste bad, and gum up your grinder. You should store your coffee in an air-tight container, at or just below room temp (about 25 degrees Celsius). </p>

<p>Coffee can and will absorb all kinds of odors, and while your freezer probably doesn't smell like much, there are odors that will (at the minimum) dull the taste of the coffee. Additionally, when you take your coffee out to room temp, condensation kicks in which further degrades the beans <em>and</em> messes up your grind. Depending on your climate, the condensation can also invite mold. Yuck!</p>

<p>The only time you should be freezing or refrigerating coffee is when you're doing so because you've created a desert with some :) Otherwise, dark air-tight containers are the best way to go, just store them in your cabinet.</p>

<p>A good rule of thumb: Store anything you buy the way it was when you bought it, unless the label tells you to do something different once you open it.</p>

"Is coffee a pro-oxidant or an antioxidant?","887","","<p>I've heard that <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee"">coffee</a> acts as a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro-oxidant"">pro-oxidant</a> which damages cells and tissues causing the long-term effect of shorting life expectancy (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-radical_theory_of_aging"">Free-radical theory of aging</a>), the opposite of how <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"">antioxidants</a> are thought to work (e.g. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_tea"">Green tea</a>).</p>

<p>Therefore is coffee a pro-oxidant or an antioxidant?</p>
","<p>In Spain one <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0023643804000933"" rel=""nofollow"">study</a> showed that <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffea_arabica"" rel=""nofollow"">Brazilian Arabica</a> 100% (A100) roasted samples <strong>presented lower antioxidant capacity</strong> (less efficient antioxidants) than <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robusta_coffee"" rel=""nofollow"">Robusta coffee</a> varieties (could be due to the higher percentage of chlorogenic acids in Robusta ground coffee than in Arabica) therefore <strong>Brazilian Arabica 100% (A100) presented the highest value of pro-oxidant activity</strong>.</p>

<p>However <strong>higher antioxidant activity was observed in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_production_in_Colombia"" rel=""nofollow"">Colombian coffees</a></strong> than in conventional roasted coffee blends. On the other hand, when the percentage of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrefacto"" rel=""nofollow"">torrefacto coffee</a> was increased, an increase of the antioxidant activity and a slight tendency to decrease the pro-oxidant activity were observed. Therefore <strong>addition of sugar</strong> at the end of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrefacto"" rel=""nofollow"">the torrefacto</a> roasting process <strong>may influence the antioxidant and pro-oxidant properties</strong> of coffee because sugar is one of the main precursors the Maillard reaction.</p>

"Coffee in a flask - How long can I store?","868","","<p>In the past I have made up to 2L of coffee using a french press and stored it in a flask that I have brought to lectures. Sometimes I will continue drinking this after 5 days, but it tastes pretty bad.</p>

<p>Two related questions: Is it bad for my health to drink after two weeks? Does it lose caffeine over time?</p>
","<p>There are a few factors at play here. The temperature that the coffee is brewed at and how well the flask holds that temperature are primary.</p>

<p>While the coffee stays hot the caffeine level will decrease. The speed will depend on the temperature and the amount of caffeine to start with (which is thoroughly discussed in other questions here).</p>

<p>When the coffee cools bacteria growth will start. At what point this bacteria become dangerous not only depends on temperature but also how clean the flask was to begin with and what quality water is being used. Clean tap water in the US, brewing coffee in a very clean french press, and placed into an incredibly clean flask could last two weeks (although it would taste terrible and have little caffeine) but if any of those steps is less than ideal there is a good chance of bacteria growth. Some people's guts will handle that bacteria without a problem, other people may get sick.</p>

<p>Edit: I should point out that as I have researched more I'm less certain about the statement regarding caffeine levels over time. Caffeine should not burn at any temperature coffee is left at, and it does not evaporate. So either experiments that say caffeine levels decrease are wrong or the reason it decreases is not clear. Some suggest that bacteria eats the caffeine, which does tie into why it becomes less safe to drink over time.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pXoSf.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Should I put my whole weight on it, or just a little? Does twisting while I tamp have an effect?</p>
","<p>Each new bean becomes a bit of an experiment with each new machine you use.</p>

<p>A rule of thumb is to grind just enough to fill the portafilter so the beveled edge of the tamper becomes flush with the edge of the portafilter using about 15kg of pressure.</p>

<p>A crude diagram:</p>

<pre><code>    ||||||     &lt; Tamper
| [||||||||] | &lt; Tamper 'head' flush with portafilter edge (note, it's flush)
| .......... | &lt; Tamped coffee
| .......... |

<p>But how much coffee that is, and just how much over 15kg you need to apply in order to tamp that much coffee to get the right pressure to pull a great shot is a matter of science that you'll need to do. You might want a finer grind instead of more pressure, you have to experiment.</p>

<p>Start with your usual espresso grind setting, a dose appropriate for the size of the filter you're using and then work from there.</p>

<p>You can get grinders that auto tamp for you based on your settings, so when you hit that 'eureka!' moment, you can reproduce it somewhat reliably <em>using the same equipment</em>. For home use? Just be ready to experiment with the first few filters full when you get beans you haven't tried before.</p>

<p>There's no real 'rule' here, other than you want as much coffee as you can get in the filter with the tamper sinking flush given about 15kg-ish of pressure. It varies wildly from there.</p>

<p>There are a bunch of brewing guides that suggest reasons; <a href=""http://www.howtobrewcoffee.com/Turkish.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this one</a>  suggests stirring down several times, and says the size is due to <strong>""physics""</strong> without explanation; <a href=""http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2013/01/how-to-make-turkish-coffee-at-home-in-an-ibrik-instructions-tips-technique-coffee-brewing.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here's another</a>. <a href=""http://coffeegeek.com/guides/turkishcoffee"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This one from CoffeeGeek</a> suggests that the shape (narrowing toward the top) helps <strong>to prevent the foam from burning to the side of the pot</strong> (becoming bitter); this makes sense especially when using a small pot on a gas stove, when the heat will try to hug the sides of the pot. And <a href=""http://www.freshcup.com/brewing-turkish/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this one</a> doesn't say to stir. All of them suggest, but none that I could find explicitly <em>state</em> the reason why the foam forms better.  In a pinch, I have tried to make Turkish coffee in a regular handled pan; it simply doesn't work as well. Something magical happens in the neck of a cezve to help that delicious foam to form; the best I can figure is that it's fragile, and the narrower neck somehow helps concentrate the bubbles, helps keep the foam together, and keeps it from collapsing. </p>

"Calculate diluted concentration of cold-brew","733","","<p>Imagine I produce a concentrated Cold-Brew, with a 1:4 ratio.</p>

<p>How can I make a cup of diluted cold-brew that contains the standard ratio (1:15) ?</p>

<p>For the response consider explaining the math with:</p>

<ul>
<li>100grs of concentrated Cold-brew (brewed with 1:4 ratio)</li>
<li>Achieve a final beverage of 500grs (<strong>must have</strong> a 1:15)</li>
</ul>

<p>PS: I don't think that is as simple as adding <em>the <strong>n</strong> remaining parts</em>, that's the reason why I'm asking this.</p>
","<p>The math is fairly simple. You know for how much concentrated cold brew you will be using that it is at a ratio of 1:4. Since the resulting concentration of the cold brew is constant (since it has already been brewed) we only really care about the parts of water that are in it; 4 parts.</p>

<p>Therefore to calculate how much water you need to add to dilute your 1:4 concentrate into a 1:15 cup, divide the amount of concentrate you are using by 4 and then multiply that by the remaining parts you wish to add, which is <code>15 - 4 = 11</code> which gives you the amount of water you need to add in whatever units you measured the amount of concentrate you started with.</p>

<p>Using your example numbers:</p>

<p>Start with 100g of cold brew concentrate at 1:4 ratio. Each part of water is therefore <code>100/4 = 25g</code>. The amount of water you will need to add is therefore <code>11 x 25g = 275g</code> to result in a total amount of 375g in your final cup.</p>

<p>Check the final answer by doing a reverse calculation. If the concentrate is 1:4 and you have 100g of it, it means you started with 25g of ground coffee. Therefore making a 1:15 ratio cup of coffee with 25g of coffee means <code>25g x 15 = 375g</code> of water must be added.</p>

<p>The answers align.</p>

<p>In general:</p>

<p>For an amount of cold brew to be diluted, <code>c</code> <em>units</em>, which has a coffee-to-water ratio of <code>1:n</code>, the amount of each part of water in the cold brew, <code>w</code> equals <code>c/n</code>. The amount of water to be added to achieve a final ratio of <code>1:m</code> is therefore <code>w x (m-n)</code> <em>units</em>.</p>

<p><em>Units</em> are any form of measure of the liquid mass being used, in g, mL or others.</p>

"Why can't I have enough crema with my espresso machine? Doesn't it provide enough pressure?","733","","<p>It seems my machine doesn't create enough pressure because I <strong>can't create a decent crema</strong>.</p>

<p>The machine heats up water which increases the pressure and eventually the water makes it through the coffee.</p>

<p>I tried compressing the coffee so it's more dense and more difficult to penetrate. </p>

<p>This lead to a longer time till the first drops of coffee started pouring but still no crema.</p>

<p>My coffee machine is a Krups 872-42 Bravo Plus:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4CXHz.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4CXHz.jpg"" alt=""Krups F 872 42 Bravo Plus""></a></p>
","<p>First things first, the ingredients of the <strong><em>crema</em></strong> is partly the answer of this question.</p>

<p>The foam on top of any coffee beverage (espresso, Turkish, aeropress or any other) is formed simply the same. A lipid/water emulsion forms the outer sphere and some gas is inside this sphere. All these spheres stick to each other with tiny coffee bean fragments invisible to human eye. Let's focus to the gas. The gas is mostly Carbon dioxide that is produced during the Maillard reaction when the coffee beans are roasted.</p>

<p>Ok, now we know the chemistry behind. There are three (actually four, but water is there all the time) main contents for our recipe to produce crema:</p>

<ol>
<li>Lipids</li>
<li>Coffee bean fragments</li>
<li>Carbon dioxide</li>
</ol>

<p>Lipids and Carbon dioxide are formed by roasting. Fragments are the very very fine powders emerge as the side product of grinding. Fragments don't leave the ground coffee. Lipids, too. But, Carbon dioxide flies away in time.</p>

<p>Normally, after roasting the beans, it is better to wait for two to four days (based on many criteria just like bean type, roast level, brewing technique, etc.) for the Carbon dioxide level of the roasted beans to settle. Then, the flavor of those beans will be delicious. After that time, Carbon dioxide fades away and the roasted beans start to stale.</p>

<p>As you can reason, if your beans have less Carbon dioxide, your final cup of coffee would have less crema. If you have freshly roasted (e.g. 3-days old) coffee, your final cup of espresso would have a thick foam.</p>

<hr>

<p>It is also known that water pressure affects the crema volume, but should not affect as much as you mentioned here. Even at 7 bars, a decent crema forms according to <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12452670"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this study</a>.</p>

<p>And a note, if your machine has difficulties producing enough pressure, more tamping will probably results over-heated water flowing very slowly through the grounds, causing them to burn and all of the lipids to evaporate, could not form the spheres of the crema. As a result, you probably worsen the crema production, coffee odor fills the room but you cannot drink that flavor. Now, all you'll get is boiled coffee juice.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> The amount of crema is mostly correlated with the freshness of the coffee, not the pressure.</p>

"How big of a difference is there between a pressurised and non-pressurised portafilter?","726","","<p>I have been trouble shooting some of my own espresso and realised that my lower-end machine might just be unable to make a better shot due to having a pressurised portafilter. So with that I wanted to find out what real differences having an unpressurised portafilter there are compared with a pressurised one.</p>

<p>For those interested, my current espresso problems are as follows:</p>

<p>I manage to get the grind to a size where I'm noticing good thin mouse tail pours but the lack of thick, golden brown crema makes me think I can get a better shot.</p>

<p>I've read that light coloured crema or thin crema is a symptom of underextraction, depending on the length of the shot (where mine was in and around 20 seconds for a double shot, so relatively fast). I then ground finer and the extraction immediately changed. The mouse tails disappeared and the extraction was fast, almost instantly blonding within a second of the extraction. Liquid was not pouring out extremely fast but in comparison with the slower previous extraction it was relatively fast. I tried to continue to lower the grind size to attempt to slow the extraction but to no avail.</p>

<p>Could this be a problem with the pressurised portafilter?</p>
","<p>Pressurized portafilters either restrict water flow or require a certain buildup of pressure before the espresso spills out the bottom of the portafilter. </p>

<p>So there are several problems with that taste-wise in espresso. The resistance is now not in the ground coffee itself, but below it. Additionally, if your coffee is ground finely and uniformly in a good espresso grinder (as one would for a non-pressurized portafilter), this sort of portafilter will result in too much resistance and thus a slow, over-extracted shot. It can also make your crema look a bit odd because it can emulsify some of the oils in your extracted shot (depending on the design of the specific portafilter).</p>

<p>Essentially the requisite grind size to produce acceptable espresso using a pressurized portafilter is much larger than that of optimal or delicious espresso.</p>

<p>This sort of portafilter does have its upsides, though. If you don't have access to a quality espresso grinder, and you are using either store-ground beans or imprecisely/more coarsely ground beans, a pressurized portafilter can make acceptable espresso from them whereas the results in a standard portafilter would be very watery and underextracted.</p>

<p>Another thing, I like to pour coffee over milk, not the other way around.</p>

<p>And my question is, can there be something behind this, or is it just subjective delusions?</p>
","<p>Yes, heating milk does have a perceptible effect on its taste.</p>

<p>That slightly sweet richness we perceive in milk is largely due to <em>lactose.</em> Lactose is the ""milk sugar"" which is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaccharide"" rel=""nofollow"">disaccharide</a> of glucose and galactose in solution in the milk.

<p>If I want to <em>reheat</em> my coffee after the keep warm period has ended, is there anything wrong with simply turning it on  to <em>brew</em>? Would that be the same as the keep warm period and thus be fine, or would it cause the heating element to behave differently and possibly burn the coffee or cause a fire hazard?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","<p>Normally in a drip coffee machine the 'brew' mode is where the water in the reservoir is boiled/heated and dripped over the ground coffee, before passing through the filter and into the jug. The 'keep warm' part is usually a hot plate under the jug which heats the jug from below, keeping the coffee warm.</p>

<p>My drip coffee machine doesn't allow you to switch it to one mode or the other, you just switch it on and it pumps the water through the filter until its empty - there is a floating switch in the bottom so it knows when there is no more water left, and the hot plate is always on.</p>

<p>I assume that your drip coffee machine works in the same way but has separate controls for the brew and keep warm features. Switching the 'keep warm' feature back on isn't going to harm anything - I'd question the quality of the coffee after 2+ hours sitting on a hot plate though. </p>

","<p>The gases themselves are largely composed of CO2 and moisture trapped in the grinds. My understanding is that releasing the gases ahead of time prevent the gasses from interfering with an even extraction throughout the brewing process.</p>

<p>As when brewing coffee, we're trying to expose the grounds evenly to the hot water, the release of gas fights against this, causing channeling or uneven extraction. This can affect your flavor profile by overextracting some of the coffee, and not extracting enough from the rest.</p>

<p>My thoughts were that the fineness mattered the most for espresso machines and that reasonable enough pressure when tamping is enough but what do expert's use and believe.</p>
","<p>Let's start off with what the function of the tamp is.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xt7gz.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<h2>Function</h2>

<p>The tamp is cylindrical in shape and is ideally just snug enough to fit into the portafilter smoothly. What the tamp does, is prime the coffee bed to be met with water. What we know about the water is that in general, in commercial machines, water is applied with 9 bars of pressure. Physics tells us that pressured water flow will take the path of least resistance. By this logic, the tamp functions by making the coffee bed smooth, even, and robust enough to be hit with 9 bars of pressure and extract evenly. </p>

<h2>Barista Health</h2>

<p><em>Note: In no way am I a qualified physician. This is not to be considered medical advice.</em></p>

<p>If the surface one tamps on is on the proper level, the barista should be able to tamp with their elbo at a 90 degree(ish) angle, and their wrists in a semi-straight path to prevent damage. The barista can then use their body weight, and not muscle, to perform the tamp. By leaning into the tamp with the correct path, one can achieve about 30lbs of pressure. </p>

<h2>Experiments with varying pressure</h2>

<p>Personally I have experimented with varying pressured tamps and have found that applying a greater pressure than 30 lbs produced little effect, at most, a longer extraction. There are other variables that should be adjusted instead, such as the grind size, to achieve such an effect.</p>

<p><strong><em>Extraction:</em></strong>
<br><strong>The <em>amount of the original mass</em> of the grounds that ends up in the brewed coffee</strong>. Though it certainly depends on the preparation method (""method of extraction"", e.g., drip, moka, espresso, cold-brew, ...), the recommended extraction amount is <strong>about 20%</strong> (i.e., about 20% of the mass of the beans/grounds ends up in the brewed coffee). </p>

<p><strong>Less than ~15%-18% extraction is considered ""under-extracted"" and can be sour.</strong> That is, under-extraction is not just a matter of inefficiency: the result can be sour and unbalanced due to the fact that acids are extracted quickly. On the other hand, <strong>more than ~22%-25% extraction is considered ""over-extracted"" and can be bitter</strong>, because the bitter compounds are extracted later in the brewing process.  </p>

<p>These figures were generated by groups with lofty-sounding names like the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_Coffee_Association_of_America"" rel=""nofollow"">Specialty Coffee Association of America</a>, the <a href=""http://www.scaa.org/chronicle/2013/10/04/the-coffee-brewing-institute/"" rel=""nofollow"">Coffee Brewing Institute</a>, and the <a href=""http://www.espressoitaliano.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Italian Espresso National Institute</a>.

<p><strong><em>Strength:</em></strong>
<br><strong>The <em>concentration</em> of the extracted compounds in the water.</strong> Basically, how much coffee is in the water per unit (volume or mass).</p>

<p>As noted in the question, there are also colloquial or vernacular uses of these terms (e.g., ""strength"" as relative flavour profile; ""extraction"" as the process of brewing, etc.) but the above seem to be the accepted tangible definitions of the terms.</p>

"Coffee brewed without filter taste less bitter and sour?","665","","<p>So my roommate and I have been a bit intrigued by brewed coffee after watching tokyo ghoul (lol)</p>

<p>We got some BonCafe grounds(southeast asia brand) at a supermarket and brewed it with a filter. Have to get sugar and milk inside.</p>

<p>He bought some whole beans (looks medium roasted) and grinded it and also drip brewed it. Even more bitter than the seemingly darker BonCafe.</p>

<p>And in Aeropress with a AbleBrew disk fine metal filter it taste even more bitter and sour than the drip brewed variants.</p>

<p>Then I got an idea from turkish coffee where you directly mix coffee grind with water without filtering. (well there is further boiling involved in turkish coffee but whatever)</p>

<p>Then after pouring in water and mixing it with coffee groind with a spoon for like 10 seconds, and letting the ground set, it tasted (to me and him) surprisingly better than drip brewing and aeropressing.</p>

<p>And to me there is coffee taste inside.</p>

<p>Recently I got some old (2014 September) lavazza qualita oro ground coffee, tried aeropress and direct mixing, same thing happened. </p>

<p>So is that the “what you are supposed to get from coffee” taste quote the connoisseurs? Or is it underextraction or something? But why isn't I seeing any recommendation on this brewing method? Am I doing anything wrong with the aeropress and drip brewed ones? (to me they taste both sour and bitter) </p>
","<p>I'm not exactly sure if this is accurate, but I think it has to do with flavor extraction. </p>

<p>When you brew with a filter, the water is going to fall through the grounds too fast to actually develop good flavor. Sure, you'll get coffee, but you're only giving the water enough time to take the more bitter tastes with it. I have this same problem with my coffee.</p>

<p>When you brew directly into water, all of the water is in contact with all of the grounds for a considerably longer amount of time. The water will extract the bitter tastes AND the more flavorful aspects of the grounds, which is why you thought this tasted better. It wasn't just bitter, it was bitter and flavorful, and that's coffee.</p>

<p>You're not doing anything wrong with the filtered methods, it's simply a matter of opinion among coffee tasters. Some people enjoy the convenience of fast, filtered, and bitter coffee because it's what they know as coffee. The reason the Turkish method isn't suggested is because, the way you describe it, it sounds like the grounds stay inside the coffee, and many people loathe having to deal with that--even though it produces much better coffee.</p>

<p>So no, you're not doing anything wrong; however, the reason you're finding flavor differences is that the extraction of flavors is far different between the two methods!</p>

"Steam-Powered Espresso Machine: Crema?","655","","<p>Hi there fellow coffee lovers! So, I recently decided to purchase my first ever espresso machine (well, kind of)! Its a steam espresso machine made my Mr. Coffee®. I know its a beginner machine, so I plan on upgrading to a pump machine in the future. </p>

<p>So, it surprisingly makes pretty good espresso! It takes really pleasant, but its missing on major element of a good espresso shot: the crema!! I simply fill the portafilter with espresso ground coffee up to the appropriate level. It seems like I grind about 2 and a half tablespoons for two ounces of water. I then ""tamp"" the coffee down with a flat spoon. I put it into my machine, turn it on, and wait like a minute for the hot espresso to come out. It sort of gives something similar to crema, but it seems for just like foam, and it doesn't last very long either. </p>

<p>Is there a way to generate crema using a steam espresso machine, or is it really not possible? Am I doing something wrong? Any feedback is appreciated! Thanks!</p>
","<p>There are a few reasons why you might not get a good crema:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stale coffee</li>
<li>Coffee not ground fine enough</li>
<li>Pressure too low</li>
</ul>

<p>With a steam-powered espresso machine (especially if it's an entry level machine), you will typically not reach high enough pressure to get a proper crema. The crema is formed by oils extracted from the ground coffee, which needs high pressure (something like 9 bars). Your steam-powered machine will probably not produce more than ~3 bars of pressure.</p>

<p>Tamping with a spoon also seems not ideal, because it will be very difficult to achieve an even tamp. I cannot comment on how important that is for this particular machine, but with higher end pump machines it might lead to channeling and uneven extraction.</p>

"How to grow coffee at home?","644","","<p>I am a heavy coffee user and I want to know what's in my coffee and therefore I'd like to grow coffee in my home.</p>

<p>Is it possible to grow coffee in an apartment?</p>
","<p>It is possible to grow coffee indoors. If allowed to grow as a tree they can reach 8 feet tall but if trimmed occasionally you can get the plant to grow more like a bush around 3-4 feet. This will change some based on the exact type.</p>

<p>Coffee plants prefer shade with a couple hours of direct sunlight in the morning. Keeping it by a window should be about right. Depending on your climate you want to be careful taking it outside during winter.</p>

<p>As J Musser mentioned, this will be a long process that will yield very little, but it can be done.</p>

<p>On the plus side, coffee plants are evergreens and look very nice as indoor plants.</p>

<p>You can read more <a href=""http://www.thanksgivingcoffee.com/blog/?p=174"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Edit: Stealing @JMussers comments to add to my answer</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One large apartment plant will only produce enough coffee for a few cups worth each year, and that's after years of growth. They do look good, though. My point was, indoor coffee plants aren't that effective. Outdoors, a good plant will produce around 2-3 lbs. of grean beans per year. They are usually planted about 8'x8' apart, or a near equivalent, so 680 plants per acre, = around 1700 lbs of green coffee per acre per year, under good conditions.</p>

","<p>You can use a blade grinder for nuts and spices as well, provided that the 'chamber' and blades are 100% stainless steel. It's pretty easy to clean the oils that would otherwise affect your next batch of beans.</p>

<p>That's not the case with a burr grinder, especially the ceramic variety - a hand-full of hazelnuts in one of those will mean <em>anything</em> coming out of it picking up that taste for quite a while.</p>

What causes certain coffee to be more ""stimulating"" than other coffee? Is is the caffeine content? How it's brewed? </p>
","<p>There are a number of concrete factors that will impact the stimulation you get from a cup of coffee, but it probably boils down to <strong>the amount of caffeine (and any other stimulants) that are in your cup</strong> that get extracted from the beans. Here's a few factors that affect the caffeine content of coffee, with links to other related questions on this site:</p>

<ul>
<li>Certain beans have more caffeine (themselves, per mass) than others, so there's more of it to get extracted into the cup;</li>
<li>Certain roasts (e.g., lighter) have more caffeine than others (see also <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/29/what-type-of-roast-has-the-lowest-caffeine-content"">lowest-caffeine roast</a>, or <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/79/how-can-i-figure-out-how-much-caffeine-is-in-my-cup"">calculating caffeine content</a>)</li>

<p>And then there's the intangible factors in ""stimulation"", such as marketing, cafe atmosphere, and so forth, which might have some other kind of effect (like ""conditioning"" or other ""mind games"") that might help you <em>feel like</em> the coffee is even more stimulating than it would be otherwise.

"Whats the purpose of preheating a coffee roaster?","600","","<p>I own a Gene Cafe and was wondering why many across the internet recommend that the roaster is preheated before the roasting takes place, in comparison to the manufacture which claims that one should just add the beans and start the roasting straight away while everything is cold.</p>
","<p>Preheating your Gene Cafe lets you choose between life cycle of the roaster and roasting consistency.  By preheating your roaster, you should be able to get more consistent roast times.  In my case my garage is sometimes 50F and sometimes 80F, so a preheat cycle would certainly probably help.  I don't do it though.  Any machine has a finite number of cycles, and you are shorting that window by preheating your machine.</p>

<p>I roast one and a half pounds a week (a half pound for work, and one pound for home).  The half pound is always done by itself from a cold start.  When I do the pound for home, I do two half pound batches, the first is from a cold start and the second is done immediately following on a ""preheated"" machine.  I try to aim for the same roast level on each of the batches and the second one consistently needs less time to reach the same level.  I generally set a timer and come back 14 minutes after the start.  This allows me to fine tune the last portion of the batch, on cold batches I generally add a bit of time, and on the preheated ones I end up subtracting a bit (to get the same roast).  I am fine with this as it saves me a cycle and will prolong the life of my roaster.  However, I can see that some folks would want the roast length of two such batches to be much closer to the same at the cost of that extra cycle.  For them it may make sense.</p>

<p>The coffee industry generates plenty of revenue for government as is.  Starbucks is paying their taxes just like every other corporation.  Creating an additional branch of government employees to regulate or adding additional employees to an existing administration (FDA perhaps?) are all expenses to regulate something that isn't currently a problem.  So it's an expense without any appreciable benefit. </p>

"Does the bloom matter in French Press?","571","","<p>I am a fan of pour-over, generally speaking, and I understand the importance of wetting the grounds, then allowing them to ""bloom"" for 45 seconds or so before beginning the extraction. The main purpose of this is to allow carbon dioxide and other gasses to escape from the grounds, so they can extract more evenly.</p>

<p>I have a coworker who is a fan of French Press, and he does a bloom in the French Press as well. I'm curious if this matters as much in this context, since the grounds are completely submerged the whole time. Is it important? If so, is it for the same reason or some other reason as a pour-over?</p>
","<p>I believe there is mysticism to blooming. Don't get me wrong, I feel its important, but I don't think it does all the things that people claim it does. Blooming is important when using fresh roasted beans(and you should be). Blooming simply aids in removing CO2 from the grounds, which would otherwise create negative space between your grounds and the water. It's simply used to provide a more even extraction. Blooming is important in any immersion brewing, and can even aid in pour-over methods as well.</p>

<p>You should also reduce your brew time slightly to compensate for the extraction that takes place during the bloom. I'd typically bloom for 30 seconds, then push the bloom down gently without agitation(agitation effect solubility).</p>

<p>I think its a dubious claim to state that the bloom does anything beyond removing the CO2, thus providing a more even extraction. It would really depend on how you perform your bloom. Do you bloom then start your timer? Do you bloom with a small amount of water first, then add more to prevent too much extraction during the bloom? Ultimately these differences in taste don't have anything to do with the bloom itself, but more so the extraction time brought on by how you perform your bloom.</p>

<p>The bloom itself does not effect taste, and it is an important part of using a french press, as its key to providing even extraction.</p>

"Does the caffeine content differ in ""ristretto"" shots?","558","","<p>My intuition tells me the difference in caffeine content will be slight to non-existent between regular shots and ristretto shots. But perhaps I'm not adequately accounting for the reduced volume. And I don't actually know the little details that might contribute to an educated guess.</p>

<p>Which part of the pour has the highest concentration of caffeine? What are the temperature and pressure ranges within which caffeine extraction is most effective? Does the color of the crema indicate anything about the caffeine levels in a single shot?</p>
","<p>Well first off what is your definition of ristretto? It's very frequently misunderstood to mean simply a short shot of espresso, when really it's all about your coffee to yield ratio. Ristretto styled shots range somewhere in the 1:1 to 1:1.5 range (arguably). For example if you put in 18 grams of coffee, and then yield out 20 grams of espresso (1:1.1)- then you are somewhere in the land of ristretto. </p>

<p>What does this mean as far as caffeine goes? There is no difference at all. Whether you are pulling a normale or a ristretto shot, you still want an extraction somewhere around 20% of the original coffee mass. This means that you are extracting the exact same amount of coffee, but simply putting that into a smaller amount of water.</p>

<p>The other thing to look at is that caffeine is one of the first compounds that is extracted in the extraction process. So even if you decided to pull the shot a bit short and under extract it, you should still have the same caffeine content.</p>

<p>So my question is, how is a filtered coffee different from unfiltered coffee, assuming we're using a paper filter? Mainly I'm looking for a scientific explanation.</p>
","<p>If you want stronger coffee (referring specifically to the amount of total dissolved solids), then you really just need a stronger coffee to water ratio. Or just simply add more coffee. 
Although what I think you are really experiencing is a difference in mouth feel. Using a paper filter with certainly give the coffee clarity. Really fine paper filters (like a chemex filter - being thick and made from soft woods) will evidently filter out very small particles - which results in a very delicate, crisp, and light mouth feel tasting cup of coffee. On the opposite end of the spectrum you have the french press. Which you end up having tiny fine particles left in your end cup, which gives a great amount of body, and a very heavy mouth feel. Both are totally fine cups of coffee, but are totally subjective to your palate. </p>

<p>The thing about extraction is that you really only want to extract about 20% of the coffee you have. If you look at an extraction versus time graphed out, you can see that it represents the curve y=sqrt(x), where extraction continues to increase as time goes on, but at a slower and slower rate. All this means is that by simply letting your coffee brew longer, you are not exactly going to make it any stronger past a certain point. You simply just need to add more coffee. As for the filter - your over all brew strength, or total dissolved solids - should basically be the exact same compared to if you didn't filter it with paper. The main difference is how it's being presented to your mouth. <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PSquf.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PSquf.png"" alt=""Extraction versus Time graph""></a></p>

"Does using an Aeropress keep more of the coffee oil (crema)?","539","","<p>I've noticed that coffee made with my Aeropress has a much richer flavor even though I use the same water temperature, number of scoops, roast, etc.</p>

<p>Is this because the Aeropress method produces crema (the tawny substance found in espresso shots)? And, if so, is there a way to optimize crema extraction with an Aeropress?</p>
","<p>The aeropress does not produce crema. There is no where near enough pressure using the aeropress to produce crema. Crema doesn't make coffee better, its typically a sign of good espresso, but isn't found in any other form of brewing nor is it what make the coffee actually taste better. French presses don't create crema either, and its a misleading yet common belief that they do.</p>

<p>The aeropress likely has about the same amount of oils as a pour-over cup of coffee if you're using the paper filters. The aeropress get it's richness from its style of brewing known as ""immersion brewing"". Longer contact with the grounds extracts compounds usually left behind by pour-over/drip methods. Combine with pressure, the aeropress, in short, just extracts more flavor by having a longer brew time and an environment which increases solubility with pressure.</p>

<p><strong>Clarification:</strong></p>

<p>The AeroPress has a short ""brew time"", however what I was meaning to say is that the aeropress and other immersion brewers have a longer contact time of the bean and the water. Therefore you have more extraction. The aeropress, unlike any other immersion method uses pressure to increase solubility. It's known that if you increase pressure that you extract quicker, and your solvent(water in this case) is able to achieve higher saturation.</p>

"How can I calibrate my Hario grinder?","531","","<p>I have a hand-held Hario grinder, like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PUiTo.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PUiTo.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The grind is adjusted by twisting a little knob underneath the black upper part. It's very hard to know when you're twisting it how far between the two endpoints you are, since it overturns in both directions, with basically no feedback.</p>

<p>What's the best way to calibrate the grind size? I'm brewing with an Aeropress.</p>
","<p>Short answer: <strong><em>Slowly. Binary search.</em></strong> But for espresso, Turkish, moka, or AeroPress: I adjust mine to nearly the tightest (smallest) setting possible that still allows me to turn the crank without difficulty.</p>

<p><strong>Method:</strong> This is how I adjust mine.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Approximate the setting by eye.</strong> Looking at the burrs, gauge about how large you'd like your grounds to be. </li>
<li><strong>Mark this setting</strong> (temporarily) with a wax pen or marker.</li>
<li><strong>Grind a bit of coffee</strong> and look at the average grind size; <strong>determine whether you'd like it coarser or finer.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Change the setting</strong> by N (e.g., 4) steps in one direction.</li>
<li><strong>Repeat</strong>. Grind a bit more coffee. If you went in the correct direction (finer or coarser), determine whether you'd like it finer or coarser. (Start over if you went in the wrong direction)</li>
<li>Change the setting by going N ÷ 2 (e.g., 2) steps in that direction.</li>
<li>Repeat the grind and check. Terminate if you're happy, or go one step at a time until you are happy.</li>
<li><strong><em>MARK THIS SETTING</strong> AND HOPE YOU NEVER HAVE TO CHANGE IT</em> ;-)</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>My experience:</strong> I have a similar Hario model (<a href=""http://www.hario.co.uk/coffee/hand-grinder/ceramic-grinder-skerton.html"">this one</a>), which sounds marginally <em>more</em> difficult to adjust than the one you're talking about. I use mine for almost all of my daily coffee grinding. I set it very infrequently: I go through phases between pour-over and moka, and I try not to go through these phases more than once per month to avoid adjusting this thing.</p>

<p>To adjust my model:</p>

<ul>
<li>Remove top nut.</li>
<li>Remove crank handle.</li>
<li>Remove setting bracket.</li>
<li>Twist the toothed, threaded washer/nut about the threaded shaft to move the nut up (counter-clock, coarser grind) or down (clock-wise, finer grind).</li>
<li>Replace bracket, handle, top nut.</li>
</ul>

<p>I mark the ""set-screw"" nut with a marker to remember where I've tried. I try to avoid going more than one revolution either way; on mine, two revolutions goes from moka-fine powder to French-press coarseness.</p>

<p><strong>When you've figured it out...</strong> I have put scratch ""marks"" on the screw for I (moka: fine), II (drip: medium), III (French press: coarse) so that I don't have to guess quite as much. Highly recommend indelible marks on your grinder once you find the setting you like. To change from one setting to the other, adjust to the middle: then go tighter to the ""fine"" setting, and looser to the ""coarse"" setting (otherwise, it can be ambiguous).</p>

<p>Other than changing the settings, I like the thing. There was even a Kickstarter that funded a stabilizing mechanism for the bottom to ensure a more-even grind: it launched as <a href=""http://kuissential.com/product/evengrind-coffee-grinder/"">EvenGrind</a> (I have no affiliation with it).</p>

"How is decaffeinated coffee made?","522","","<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tNs6ym.jpg"" alt=""what&#39;s the difference between regular and decaf coffee""></p>

<p>Okay but seriously, how is decaffeinated coffee made? How does this process affect the flavour? (I'm assuming it does because decaffeinated coffee seems to be the source of much derision...)</p>
","<h2>Basics</h2>

<p><strong>Decaffeination</strong> (<em>decaf</em>) is the removal of <strong>caffeine</strong> from coffee beans, cocoa,  and other caffeine-containing materials. While soft drinks which do not use caffeine as an ingredient are sometimes described as ""decaffeinated"", they are better termed ""uncaffeinated"" because decaffeinated implies that there was caffeine present at one point in time. Decaffeinated drinks contain typically 1–2% of the original caffeine content or sometimes as much as 20%.</p>

<p>In the case of coffee, various methods can be used. The process is usually performed on unroasted (green) beans, and starts with steaming of the beans. They are then rinsed with a solvent that extracts the caffeine while leaving other constituents largely unaffected. The process is repeated from 8 to 12 times until the caffeine content meets the required standard (97% of caffeine removed according to the international standard, or 99.9% caffeine-free by mass as per the EU standard). Coffee contains over 400 components important to the taste and aroma of the drink, so it is difficult to remove the caffeine without affecting other components.</p>

<p>Want to know even more?</p>

<h2>Advanced</h2>

<p>Well, then, let's talk about the two most common types of decaffeination:</p>

<h3>Swiss Water process</h3>

<p>The use of water as the solvent to decaffeinate coffee was originally pioneered in Switzerland in 1933 and developed as a commercially viable method of decaffeination by Coffex S.A. in 1980. </p>

<p>This method is different in that it does not directly or indirectly add chemicals to extract the caffeine. Rather, it relies entirely on two concepts - solubility and osmosis - to decaffeinate coffee beans. The process begins by immersing a batch of green coffee beans in very hot water in order to dissolve and extract the caffeine. The water is then drawn off and passed through an activated charcoal filter. The porosity of this filter is sized to only capture larger caffeine molecules, while allowing smaller oil and flavor molecules to pass through it. However, this extraction process will also extract desirable oils and other solids from the beans, resulting in beans with no caffeine and no flavor in one tank, and caffeine-free but with flavor water in another tank. The Swiss Water process method attempts to overcome this difficulty by first discarding the flavorless caffeine-free beans, and then reusing the flavor rich water to remove the caffeine from a fresh batch of coffee beans. Water saturated in this way is referred to as green coffee extract or GCE. It is created using a separate batch of green coffee beans, which are immersed in water and then discarded. In a pre-loading tank water, cane sugar and formic acid are mixed and heated and used to preload carbon filter columns. The GCE is then filtered over the columns to extract caffeine from it. A fresh batch of green coffee beans is then immersed in the GCE to remove caffeine but retain other components. The other components can be retained because the water is already saturated with flavor ingredients, therefore, the flavors in this fresh bath cannot dissolve - only caffeine moves from the coffee beans to the water. This results in decaffeination without a massive loss of flavor. The process of filtering the GCE to remove caffeine and immersing the beans is repeated until the beans are 99.9% caffeine free by mass, meeting the required standard. This process takes 8 to 10 hours.</p>

<h3>CO<sub>2</sub> process</h3>

<p>it is technically known as supercritical fluid extraction. This method is the most recent method developed by Kurt Zosel, a scientist of the Max Plank Institute, and uses liquid CO2 in place of chemical solvents.</p>

<p>The supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> acts selectively on the caffeine, releasing the alkaloid and nothing else. Water soaked coffee beans are placed in an extraction vessel. The extractor is then sealed and liquid CO<sub>2</sub> is forced into the coffee at pressures of 1,000 pounds per square inch to extract the caffeine. The CO<sub>2</sub> acts as the solvent to dissolve and draw the caffeine from the coffee beans, leaving the larger-molecule flavor components behind. The caffeine laden CO2 is then transferred to another container called the absorption chamber where the pressure is released and the CO<sub>2</sub> returns to its gaseous state and evaporates, leaving the caffeine behind. The caffeine is removed from the CO<sub>2</sub> using charcoal filters and the caffeine free CO<sub>2</sub> is pumped back into a pressurized container for reuse on another batch of beans. This process has the advantage that it avoids the use of potentially harmful substances. Because of its cost, this process is primarily used to decaffeinate large quantities of commercial-grade, less-exotic coffee found in grocery stores.</p>

<p>There are like 3 more common processes but I believe 2 is enough, even for coffee enthusiasts like us.</p>

<p>Sourced from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org</a></p>

<p>This is not my opinion although I don't have decaf, but just something I picked up on the net:

"How to prepare good coffee during an outdoor trip?","522","","<p>I am planning some hiking/climbing trips this year so I started looking into portable espresso machines. I found these <a href=""http://www.handpresso.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">products</a> and also this <a href=""http://www.wacaco.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">ESPRESSO ON THE GO</a> (this one actually got me super excited and I'm definitely getting one). No idea what the exact differences are apart from the price - The first one is much more expensive. I was wondering whether there are any old school tricks to prepare good coffee on an outdoor trip that don't require you taking too much equipment with you - I would prefer espresso but I realize that this is probably unrealistic. Also, what type of beans would you take on such a trip and how would you store them?</p>
","<p>I'm going to focus on the ""old-school"" aspect of your question.</p>

<p>From my perspective/experience, the classic way of producing ""camp coffee"" is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_percolator"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>percolator</strong></a>. To use this device, you put grounds in a basket on the top, water in the bottom, assemble the apparatus, and put it over a heat source (e.g., camp fire, stove, etc.). If you want a stronger brew (as it sounds like you do), you can also use a moka pot (some call this a ""stovetop espresso maker"", though I don't care for that term) -- there are some <a href=""http://www.mec.ca/product/5006-001/gsi-stainless-steel-espresso-maker/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">very <strong>compact moka pots</strong> like this one</a> that are targeted for backpacking/camping. This will give you very good moka-pot-strong espresso-like coffee, but you won't mistake it for espresso out of a professional espresso machine. You get the full experience of brewing a pot of coffee in the wilderness, which I enjoy. See also my related q/a on <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/418/whats-the-difference-between-a-percolator-and-a-moka-pot"">the difference between a percolator and a moka pot</a>. Those are my preferences for camp coffee.</p>

<p>For a little more technology, you can use <strong>integrated heater/container systems</strong> like the <a href=""http://www.jetboil.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">JetBoil</a>; they also have small accessories like this <a href=""http://www.jetboil.com/Products/Coffee-Press/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">French press insert</a> so you can minimize the extra gear (e.g., you can use the setup for heating water for other cooking, <em>and</em> (separately) use it to make coffee).</p>

<p>On the extreme end of low-weight and low-technology spectrum, you could use <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_coffee"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">instant coffee</a> or try <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B001M05070"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">coffee bags such as these</a>, which are like tea bags, except that they are filled with coffee. You could even make your own coffee-bags (see <a href=""http://www.instructables.com/id/Customize-your-own-portable-coffee-bags/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">instructables</a> and <a href=""http://makethebestofeverything.com/2013/07/diy-coffee-brewing-bags.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MtBoE</a>). Though there are tradeoffs and <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/19369/why-dont-we-make-coffee-in-the-same-way-we-make-tea"">reasons you might not want to do this, from Seasoned Advice</a>. These single-serve coffee bags have the advantage of minimal clean-up, and the whole package may be compostable. Also you don't have to worry about hot gear if you're packing up to get on the trail quickly (e.g., backpacking). Bags and instant are passable, ultra-light substitutes for actual coffee that get the job done but are less enjoyable to drink (for me).</p>

<p>Storage of beans and/or grounds is tricky -- <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/123/when-does-coffee-go-off"">especially already-ground coffee goes stale very quickly</a>. You can minimize the damage by keeping everything sealed and dry. See also questions about <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1/how-should-i-store-whole-bean-coffee"">storage in general</a> and <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1566/how-much-does-keeping-beans-vacuum-sealed-matter"">vacuum-sealing</a>. You could always use <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1540/why-would-anyone-want-to-hand-grind-their-coffee"">a hand grinder</a>, but that's more gear and more weight.</p>

<p>In sum: <strong>I go ""fast and light"" for coffee on the trail: gear that's reasonably light, that I can use quickly</strong> (for me, this is moka pot) so I can get the caffeine-dose done and get back on the trail. Pre-grind the coffee into a zip-top bag and evacuate as much air as possible. Deal with the slightly-stale taste and focus on being outdoors!</p>

<p>My question is about both stages:</p>

<ul>
<li>how do I know when it's heated enough to take it off the fire, and</li>
<li>how much should it be cooled down?</li>
</ul>

<p>The guides to brewing Turkish usually discuss that at the abstract level: heat + remove three times. I've been trying to do that, but my actions didn't seem to make sense. So right now I'm brewing it just once -- till the foam starts to rise, and enjoy it. But maybe I still can improve it?</p>
","<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> <em>This will be a long answer. I expect that it wont be as good as I want at first. I may make corrections/additions afterwards. I am a native Turkish, drinking kgs of coffee each week and from a coffee addicted family for generations. Therefore, I count myself as a Turkish-coffee hobbyist.</em></p>

<p>I believe to understand the two or three times boiling mystery of Turkish coffee, you must understand the whole Turkish-style extraction process. I tell you the whole story.</p>

<p>The chemistry is simple: we are extracting some oils from the beans. Two known ways out there, pressure or heat. Turkish extraction is the traditional, genuine, historical heating way. Actually, it is probably the first and easiest way manhood used in history to prepare coffee (I believe both in Africa and then in Ottoman Empire).</p>

<p>When you heat the beans to extract, you need lots of surface to extract efficiently. That's why you grind the beans as fine as possible. The electrical grinders are not always perfect. You may want to use a mortar after the grinding process to be sure if you don't have a Turkish grinder. (This is another topic, I think.)</p>

<p>Then, the aromatic oils you are trying to extract are not of one kind. There are several kinds. The drink you consume under the name of coffee is delicious if it includes many of them. So, you are trying to jail all of them into the water during the brewing process. But, wait... Some of them start to be released from the bean at 75 degrees Celsius, but some others have been already vaporized at 70 degrees Celsius! There must be a way of collecting all of them.</p>

<p>Bingo! You are right. It is the double (triple, quadruple, ...) heating process.</p>

<p>You should heat the water up to some point, extract a subset of the oils, separate them to your fincan (cup). Then repeat the process at a higher degree. Three times is the best practice among Turks. You may define your own temperature slots and repetition count but I think the algorithm is clear now.</p>

<p><strong>Talking about best practice, let me show you a best practice.</strong></p>

<p>Get you cezve (pot). Mine is stainless steel and thick. Your coffee should not boil on the edges first, it must start to boil from the center. (If this is not the case, either your cezve or your fire is problematic.)</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cr9ZC.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cr9ZC.jpg"" alt=""cezve""></a></p>

<p>If you have a hand grinder, set it to the finest.</p>

<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LPGhB.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LPGhB.jpg"" alt=""hand grinder setting""></a></p>

<p>Measure the water with fincan (cup) (I prefer soft spring water) and fill your cezve. Traditional fincans are quite thin (in contrast to espresso cups) and porcelain.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nlZBI.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nlZBI.jpg"" alt=""fincan""></a></p>

<p>After you fill in your cezve with water, add coffee on top. About one teaspoon per fincan is quite OK. (You may change). I don't recommend sugar for any kind of coffee, but it is your taste. If you want to add sugar, it is now or never.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fo8C2.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fo8C2.jpg"" alt=""Floating Turkish coffee""></a></p>

<p>You will see that fine grounded coffee will float and sink in time. Fire up and let the coffee sink by itself. Do not touch or stir. The amount of fire has little or no affect to the taste of Turkish coffee to my experience. There is an urban legend that states that Turkish coffee is best made in wood fire or very slowly in low temperatures, etc. It's nonsense. Then, every aromatic oil will evaporate eventually. You should be quick. These are just romantic/melancholic scenes for old days heard from grandfathers. This was my setting.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/njG5o.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/njG5o.jpg"" alt=""Fire setting for Turkish coffee""></a></p>

<p>After a while, all coffee will eventually sink. This is an indicator. Your coffee is somewhat homogeneously distributed in water. Also you have a nice grease remains already on top of water. However, they cannot form a foam yet. Cause, we didn't stir it.</p>

<p>Stir again. For about a minute. Stirring keeps the foam intact. You may stop from time to time to check the color and then continue. It gets mature when you first see the red/fire color.</p>

<p>Check the second image. Could you see the firefox there? Could you? Ok, now it is time for the first shot. Actually, I would like you to compare the second foam image with the one above. Try to figure out the differences. We started with light color, it turned out to red/fire color. We started with no bubbles, it has bubbles now.</p>

<p>We'll pour some of the coffee to our fincans. I pour the foamy part and fill about 2/5 of my fincans.</p>

<p>Still, I have enough foam and lots of oils to extract in my ground beans. I continue to heat and stir. Don't forget to stir and keep foam intact. This time the foam turns from red/fire to brown/coffee-bean-color. Still, I'm very far from boiling. Fill another 2/5 of your fincans. The fincans are nearly full.</p>

<p>Now, we hardly have any foam left in our cezve. We are heating the coffee for the last shot. This will be very close to the boiling point. You can hardly see any foam now, but mostly bubbles. At one point, the boiling starts in the middle. Take the cezve out of the fire very quickly to prevent burning the coffee and pour the rest of the coffee to the fincans.</p>

"What type of roast has the lowest caffeine content?","474","","<p>I'm aiming to reduce my caffeine intake, but don't want to drop coffee altogether. What roasts / beans release the least amount of caffeine into my body when drank?</p>
","<p>In general, <strong>darker, arabica</strong> roasts have less caffeine. Arabica (as opposed to robusta) inherently has less caffeine in it naturally, and darker coffees have less caffeine since they have been roasted longer or at higher temperatures, <strike>essentially ""burning"" the caffeine out of the bean.
</strike></p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>For some science, Arabica is usually found to be about 1.2% caffeine and Robusta is typically 2.2% caffeine</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Source: <a href=""http://coffeechemistry.com/agriculture/differences-between-arabica-and-robusta-coffee.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Differences between Arabica and Robusta Coffee</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chris in AK has a great explanation in the comments as to why darker roasts are <em>perceived</em> to have less caffeine</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is a common misconception that darker roasts have less caffeine.  Caffeine's melting point is 455F which is well above what most beans reach during the roasting process.  Essentially, caffeine content changes because the mass/density of the beans change (they lose water and undergo changes in the roasting process).   If you measure your coffee by volume, dense greener beans will have more caffeine.  If you measure by weight, darker roasted beans will have more caffeine.</p>

"Ground coffee or beans","471","","<p>I have just recently started drinking coffee, and have got myself a small counter top espresso machine. </p>

<p>Some people in work have suggested that instead of buying ground coffee (I have been using Lavazza ground coffee) I should buy beans and grind it myself. I have asked why, but no one has been able to give a better answer than ""it just is better"", so I am hoping someone here can help me find a better answer to this question. Or is it just personal preferences?</p>

<p>Also, as a newcomer to this, I know that the coffee someone uses is down to personal tastes and what have you, but I am just wondering if there are any coffee manufacturers who are very good when it comes to espresso (I mostly drink espresso).</p>
","<p>Ground beans have a much larger surface area by weight than whole beans. When the surface of the bean is exposed to air chemical reactions take place. I doubt that these reactions have been completely characterized but at a minimum they include some loss of aromatic oils. In other words, the processes that lead to a judgment that coffee is ""old"" happen faster in ground coffee.  </p>

<p>You can do the experiment easily and cheaply by comparing the results of coffee made with freshly-ground and pre-ground versions of same brand/date coffee. You can always borrow a grinder.</p>

<p>The experiment might not work if both samples of coffee are old (or poor quality). Otherwise I think you would notice a difference. Whether the difference is worth paying for is a different question; but the only costs are a grinder and time to grind the beans. </p>

<p>A short answer to the question about brands might be: good, fresh Arabica beans are similar in many ways, up to roasting. Some people prefer a light roast, others medium or dark. Once you decide, find a brand that does what you like consistently. </p>

"Does instant coffee give a lesser buzz/high than conventional filter/french press coffee?","462","","<p>I have felt that percolated/french pressed coffee keeps me awake more than instant coffee brew. </p>

<p>EDIT: Since it was (validly) pointed out it will depend on the amount, so the amount, that I am comparing is basically what is mentioned on the packet of instant or ground coffee (whichever is the case). 
As in if my instant coffee sachet says it makes 2 cups of coffee, I use half of it. And if the ground coffee says to use the filtrate of 2 tablespoons for each cup, I do the same. </p>
","<p>Caffeine content varies greatly by preparation and brew method.  Instant coffee is generally designed to produce something close to a cup of drip coffee.  ""Cups"" is unfortunately not well defined and may vary based on it's usage.  Beyond that, percolated and french press coffee is generally prepared stronger (more concentrated) that regular drip coffee (and probably much stronger than the watered down concentration instant is designed for).  It's also very likely that some amount of caffeine is lost during the freeze dry process since it is so water soluble.  </p>

<p>TL;DR Yes.  Real brewed coffee will generally have a higher caffeine concentration than coffee that has been brewed, dehydrated, then re-hydrated.</p>

"When accounting for bloom, why is the common instruction to stir with very little water?","456","","<p>There is already a question on <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/337/what-is-coffee-bloom"">What is coffee bloom</a> here, and one about <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/21482/when-making-french-press-coffee-what-is-the-purpose-of-blooming-the-grounds"">why ""blooming"" the grounds is necessary</a> over on seasoned advice. A currently unanswered question here is <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1683/does-the-bloom-matter-in-french-press"">is blooming actually necessary in French Press</a>, which an answer to that may help answer this one.</p>

<p>A fair amount of instructions I've seen that refer to this step instruct you to stir after adding just enough water to get all the grounds wet. However, there are accounts of people getting the same effect just stirring after all the water is added (in non-drip styles of coffee).</p>

<p>Is there a significant difference between blooming with some water and blooming with all? I like being able to rinse off the stirrer with the rest of the water, but I'm curious nevertheless.</p>
","<p>Blooming is the outgassing of CO2 (carbon dioxide) from the ground coffee in response to hot water being added.  The more recently the coffee has been roasted, the more bloom you can expect.  It doesn't make a huge difference ultimately if this is done quickly or slowly when you brew your coffee.  What I have noticed myself is that it's sometimes diffcult to predict how much foam is going to be produced when the water is poured over the grounds.  More than once I have misjudged the amount of bloom and made a foamy brown mess on my countertop.  If you just add enough water to wet the grounds first, you accomplish two things.  </p>

<p>First, all the coffee is wetted at nearly the same time which better controls how the flavors are extracted, since different flavor profiles extract at different rates.  Sometimes adding all the water at once creates lumps of dry coffee mixed in with the bloom and wetted coffee and it takes a bit of stirring to get all that wetted.  </p>

<p>Secondly, adding a small amount of water controls how quickly the bloom will occur. You'll get most of the bloom done well within the pot and you'll avoid the huge foam ball at the top of your brew that might overflow the pot (or AeroPress in my case), but really this is more of a technique thing than a chemistry thing.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[...] no coffee snob I know would be caught dead drinking a latte, especially the Starbucks latte they implied.</p>

","<p>In order to maintain consistency, Starbucks roasts their coffee a <em>tad</em> bit longer than many might prefer. The espresso you get in New York is going to taste exactly like the one you got in Hong Kong, or New Delhi - that's actually kind of impressive. Still, if you're someone that likes their beans just past the second 'crack' - you might find their espresso a bit too dark, a bit too bitter and a bit too expensive to be accepting of a disappointment. </p>

<p>Now, the coffee that they sell <em>in bags</em> gives you plenty of options - you can still get a nice blonde-roasted bag of single source Arabica at many locations.

<p>What should I try to give this coffee a chance?</p>
","<p>It sounds like the main thing you're not carefully controlling for is <strong>temperature</strong>.  I have found that if I use cooler temperatures (80-92 degrees celsius) for my pour-over, I get very bright/acidic tones.  Hotter water (92-100 degrees celsius) always gives me more bitterness and earthy flavors.  I use an electric kettle with a thermometer to maintain the temperature accurately so I can keep a temperature in the middle, in order to get both sets of flavors.  I would guess that by 2:45, your water is too cool and you're just extracting the acidic notes.  Try keeping your water hotter (and measure to see what temperature you're using).  </p>

<p>I might also suggest giving your coffee a nice 60 second bloom time (pour enough water over them to get them wet, then wait for the gas to escape).  That helps you extract everything (complex and bitter notes included) from the grounds.</p>

<p>You could also consider letting your coffee age a bit longer.  Sometimes, beans are best 7+ days after roasting.</p>

"Why do most coffee shops use such dark roast?","444","","<p>I've noticed that most (non-specialty) places that sell coffee tend to have very dark roasts. This includes Starbucks, any Fast Food restaurant, most nicer restaurants, and hotel coffee.  </p>

<p>I can't tolerate anything darker than Starbucks' ""Blonde Roast"". All their others I'd consider to be dark roast. When I buy coffee in the store and make it myself, it's never anywhere near as dark as what you get in shops. I usually get fresh beans from The Fresh Market or Caribou brand.  </p>

<p>Is there any reason shops tend to make their coffee so dark? Or is my taste just skewed from most people's?</p>
","<p>Roasting coffee dark may be used because it is easier to create a consistently flavored bean, with less monitoring and concern for flavor profiles. In the case of Starbucks they are shipping so much of their coffee to so many locations and creating so much coffee at once that it may be easier to create consistency. The darker you roast the less the flavor of the original bean matters, so it may also be used as a method to roast cheaper or lower quality beans.</p>

","<p>It doesn't actually matter!</p>

<p>The valve on the bag is there to let gas out without letting gas in. The reason for this is that freshly roasted beans will continue to give off a bit of CO2 for a little while. Coffee that's packaged immediately after roasting will give off a bit in the bag, hence the need for a valve.</p>

<p>Oxygen causes coffee to go off, which is why we keep our coffee in airtight containers to preserve it as long as possible. It's why the valve on the bag is designed to prevent air from the outside getting in.</p>

<p>To answer your question, it depends on how you like your coffee.  Grind finer and/or pour slower and you will get a stronger cup of coffee.  Grind courser and pour more quickly and you will get a weaker cup of coffee.  Pouring from the center sometime results in a raised edge around the rim, which isn't ideal when I am trying to fill the cone as full as possible, but in a true pour over, may be fine.  Pouring from the side seems to sometimes result in a small island of dry grounds floating in the middle of the cone.  For that reason, I generally vary my pour around the cone to minimize either effect and then stir some for good measure.</p>

","<p>You can <em>absolutely develop a dependency</em>.
The important thing to remember is that there are physical and mental aspects to addiction. If you look forward to it hard enough, <em>any</em> amount of time can pass and you can still crave it just as deeply. Sometimes a deep craving can even result in symptoms that shouldn't be explainable by chemical explanations [Psychosomatic effects].</p>

<p>It would also depend heavily on dosing. You would want to make sure that you don't try to compensate for your days off by going on a binge and placing yourself directly under the espresso maker until you've had 3 days worth! In fact, that could make the problem worse because the difference between your ""on days"" and off days would be so much greater you might await those days the same way a junkie looks forward to their next hit.</p>

<p>droog has the right idea. Try to see if there are ways to rotate in other substitutes for coffee. Maybe you enjoy the hot drink, or you look forward to the short break it takes to prepare it. Regardless, people just don't go well with negative feedback. If you feel as if you are deeply depriving yourself, then change your approach. The way to be successful is to find a way that cuts down your caffeine intake while also not feeling as if you have lost something.</p>

"Does coffee cause dehydration?","406","","<p>Actual scientific information on the effects of food and drink is notoriously hard to sift from all the dieting pseudoscience. I know that caffeine is a diuretic, which means it will cause me to lose more water, but given that I'm dosing up on it with water, will I lose more water than I gain? Even if it doesn't for longer drinks, will drinking espresso result in a net loss of water?</p>
","<p>Though caffeine's action as a diuretic is hotly debated, recently it seems the scientific consensus is that caffeine in normal doses is a weak diuretic in <em>caffeine-naive</em> individuals only (those without a tolerance), and only in doses exceeding 250-300 mg, or 2-3 cups of coffee. To go even further,</p>

  develops, however, and the actions are much diminished in individuals
  who regularly consume tea or coffee.</p>

"Does the flavour of coffee beans improve after opening the bag?","401","","<p>After I open a bag of beans, the flavour of the coffee seems better after the bag has been opened a day or more.  </p>

<p>Does the flavour of coffee beans improve for a period of time after the bag has been opened?  Perhaps I'm imagining it!</p>
","<p>That is almost the opposite of my experience, after opening a bag of beans, they have noticeable less flavour after a couple of days. Coffee beans are more resistant than ground coffee though, as that decays in a couple of hours. Obviously, if beans are exposed to air for long enough, their quality is decreasing.</p>

<p>However there is an effect that improve them at first, simply because some of the processes from the roasting takes time to finish, and may require several days in order to do so. They may even require exposure to air (oxygen) in order to oxidise some of the compounds causing the flavour. Keep in mind that even though <em>some</em> of the compounds improve, other does not. The most notable degradation in the first days is caused by the most volatile aroma compounds evaporating.</p>

<p>This graph shows the stalling of coffee as a function of time. Note that this is just a visualisation of the aroma compounds evaporating, not necessary a measure of quality. The remaining compounds are also changing, and some of them improves over time.</p>

"What gives coffee its acidic (sour) taste?","395","","<p>I read somewhere that too cold water is what gives coffee its acidity, how does that take place?</p>

<p>Furthermore, does that apply only to the water during the brewing process or as my cup of coffee cools down, the acidity increase?</p>
","<p>That's correct: as your cup cools, perceived acidity increases. This is due to variation in the chemical species affected by temperature. </p>

<p>Coffee is like ice cream. Ice cream is least sweet when it's stone cold, and tart and heavy when it has melted. Similarly, coffee is sweetest (and best) while it's hot, and is bitter or acrid when it has cooled. Furthermore, the cooler temp has led to chemical degradation and thus the awful taste. However, you won't perceive its flavors when the coffee is too hot -- so let it cool a bit.</p>

<p>As for your question whether the on-contact brew temperature affects end-result sweetness-sourness: there are a lot of baristas and coffee R&amp;D pros who do temperature-control brewing, especially for espresso, in order to modify the flavor of the coffee. </p>

<p>I believe that varying temperature affects coffee flavor in a gradient.</p>

<p>For cold brew (in case you're also curious about that), the cold temperature is a different environment entirely. Coffee is just as soluble, however less energetically kinetic, so more time is substituted for the lack of temperature. The end result is a brew product that functions naturally as a cold product -- nice, sweet, characteristic.</p>

"How bad is coffee for your teeth?","394","","<p>I occasionally hear people saying that coffee has bad implications for the health of teeth. Are there any significant dental studies proving/disproving this statement?</p>
","<p>A recent study published in <em>Letters in Applied Microbiology</em> suggests that coffee can break down bacterial plaques that form on teeth. These studies were done in a lab on extracted teeth, using moderate amounts of coffee on lab-grown plaques formed by bacteria from saliva. Antibacterial effect of coffee: calcium concentration in a culture containing teeth/biofilm exposed to Coffea Canephora aqueous extract,
<em>Letters in Applied Microbiology,</em> Volume 59, Issue 3, September 2014, Pages: 342–347, N. Meckelburg <em>et al.</em></p>

<p>Coffee can stain teeth. Is that a health issue? It's often listed with other dental health issues but I'm not sure why. </p>

<p>The acidity of coffee may wear down teeth over time, but it's not a prime suspect. The acidity of coffee generally falls somewhere between that of pure water and cow's milk, according to one <a href=""http://www.highergroundstrading.com/blog/38/coffee-acidity:-the-science-and-the-experience--"">article.</a> Fruit juice and soft drinks are far more acidic (pH &lt; 3). Coffee is only slightly more acidic than saliva. There is no shortage of articles claiming high acidity of coffee but 
a pH of 5--a plausible average--is not very high.</p>

<p>There are probably hundreds of studies in English alone on the effect of coffee on dental health. In terms of acidity it's not as bad as juice and not as benign as water. The plaque-preventive effect is something new to consider. There is also a 2012 study by the American Cancer Society suggesting that coffee lowers the risk of oral cancer. Those who drank 4+ cups of coffee a day were about half as likely to die of oral/pharyngeal cancer as those who drank occasionally or not at all. Coffee, Tea, and Fatal Oral/Pharyngeal Cancer in a Large Prospective U.S. Cohort, <em>American Journal of Epidemiology,</em> Dec. 2012 (online), Hildebrand et al. To the extent that oral cancer is a dental health issue this is also something to weigh.  </p>

<p>Science doesn't necessarily furnish a simple answer. It appears that the mildly corrosive effect of coffee may be offset by a tendency to reduce plaque. If coffee helps reduce the risk of oral cancer one could argue that, overall, the benefits of coffee for dental health outweigh the risks. </p>

"How can I get a more even grind with a rotary grinder?","394","","<p>In general, <strong>I prefer burr grinders</strong> for grinding coffee beans, but sometimes I have to use a rotary grinder. <strong>I'd like to understand how to best use the rotary grinder for grinding coffee beans.</strong></p>

<p>I find burr grinders generally produce a superior result in terms of <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/84/how-does-coffee-grind-consistency-affect-coffee-taste"">grind consistency</a>, less heat generated, and therefore final product is better. Sometimes in a pinch, however, I need to use a rotary grinder (e.g., it's the only grinder around; burr grinder hopper is full of other beans; flavoured beans that I don't want to pollute the burr grinder; testing to see if a newly roasted batch of beans is ""ready"", etc.) -- and there <em>are</em> <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1812/blade-grinders-any-advantage-over-burr-grinders-besides-cost"">some advantages of rotary grinders</a>.</p>

<p><strong>I'd like to use the rotary grinder in such a way as <em>to make the ground coffee particle size as even as possible.</em></strong> Is this even possible? I find that, no matter how I use the thing, I end up with some very large chunks (even whole beans) and some extremely fine powder. The result is only usable in filter coffee (drip/pour-over), but it simply doesn't ""work"" as well as when the ground coffee particle size is more even.</p>

<p>I have searched for techniques or recommendations, but I find exactly <em>nothing</em> helpful on this, but I believe there must be <em>some way</em> to optimize the use of a rotary grinder. I have tried things like...</p>

<ul>
<li>Pulsing the machine. Turning on for a second, then letting the blades come to rest, then pulsing some more, until I achieve approximately the grind I'm looking for;</li>
<li>Shaking the grinder up and down during the grinding;</li>
<li>Revolving the grinder around in a circle the opposite way that the blades are spinning;</li>
<li>Using more or less beans in a single grinding session (""half full"" seems to work best for me)</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these seem to have minimal / marginal benefit. <strong>Is there any way to improve the coffee bean grind consistency using a rotary grinder?</strong></p>
","<p>""Using more or less beans in a single grinding session"" will yield the most bang for buck, usually.  However, this is highly dependent on your particular rotary grinder.  Rotary grinders are like miniature blenders.  Just like in a full size blender trying to make a milkshake or something, if you over- or under-fill the blender, then the blade won't be able to mix the ingredients as it cuts through them.  Cheap grinders won't be designed to mix very well as they grind, so with terrible grinders, you probably won't see much benefit to your strides.</p>

<p>You need to experiment with your particular blade-style rotary grinder to see how much you can add without prohibiting movement once the beans are fully chopped up, and without leaving too much movement where they just bounce around inside.  Too much room will create friction from the grinder chamber sides, and will start to warm up the coffee oils.  Too little room will result in the same bean being over-ground (too much friction from the blade), and you'll get coffee paste in the inner center of the grinder chamber.</p>

<p>Achieving consistency and repeatability to the level of a fast-food chain will be impossible, as rotary grinders are way to sensitive to how many beans you put in, as well as size and shape of the bean, how hard the bean is (age of bean), lunar phase, etc.  Maybe this is why all the big coffee chains use more expensive burr grinders in-store (not that the coffee is better, which it arguably is, its just more predictable).  Some fancy rotary grinders have timers and knobs and levers to set so you don't have to count to yourself before you let go of the grind-button.  That helps, but is far from a silver bullet.</p>

"Why does the filtrate sometimes well up in the upper cone when using the Chemex coffeemaker","371","","<p>When using the glass-handled 6-cup <em>Chemex</em> like this one:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Il8CQ.jpg"" alt=""Chemex 6-cup, glass-handle""></p>

<p>and the appropriate <em>Chemex</em> conical paper filter, the filtrate (liquid that has passed through the coffee and the filter) sometimes wells up between the filter and the upper glass cone of the carafe. This slows down the flow of liquid dripping into the bottom of the carafe.</p>

<p>I usually resolve the issue by gently lifting the filter (with coffee and water in it) away from the glass for a second which allows the accumulated filtrate to drop into the bottom of the carafe. So it is not a fatal issue, but I'd still like to know why this tends to happen. </p>
","<p><strong>Science!</strong> What follows is my bogus hypothesis, with pictures (annotated in the <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/19775/262760"">conventional style</a>) and annotations to bolster my unsubstantiated claims.</p>

<p>Other (non-Chemex) cone-style (and basket-style) filters often have ridges down the inside of the cone. It seems that these ridges serve two purposes: to provide channels down which the coffee can flow, and to help ""wick"" the coffee away from the filter. This seems to help the coffee drain faster. This is probably due to properties of water like cohesion, adhesion, surface tension, and perhaps capillary action (legitimacy of these claims is left as an exercise to the reader).</p>

<p>Contrasting the two types of cones:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wB2fc.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>between a ceramic cone filter (white, left) and the Chemex cone (glass, right). I think the ridges prevent the ""wells"" from forming.  With a flat surface (like the Chemex), the filter somehow ""seals"" itself against the side of the cone, restricting the flow of coffee well enough to cause the pooling you describe. I assume this happens because the grounds get packed solidly at the bottom of the cone, and perhaps expand slightly. I don't have a better answer for ""why"" this seal happens. Lifting the filter (as you describe) breaks the ""seal"" and permits the coffee to drain.</p>

<p>Another way that I sometimes resolve the issue is to slide a bamboo skewer (or stir-stick, or chop-stick, etc.) between the filter and the Chemex cone (careful not to tear the filter!). This seems to work by providing a similar ""ridge"" that the other cone filters provide; it prevents the coffee-pockets from forming next to the skewer. I have also tried to fold little ""pleats"" in the filter, but it's annoying and doesn't work all that well.</p>

<p>I find that this ""pooling"" happens more often when I use a finer grind. I think a finer grind packs itself down more in the bottom of the cone and clogs up the filter more quickly. Both of these could believably cause the ""sealing,"" but I don't have any other real evidence. It also drains more slowly in other drip brewing methods also. For these reasons I use a coarser grind when using the Chemex than when I'm brewing pour-over with the ridged cone filter. In fact, the <a href=""https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/chemex"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Blue Bottle Chemex brewing guide</a> suggests a much coarser grind than regular filter coffee, like that of French press. Maybe that's for the same reason.</p>

<p>The pour-spout on the Chemex helps with this a little by allowing steam/air to escape from the bottom chamber. A pre-wet filter can sometimes slide down into the pour-spout and nearly seal it, which will also make it more difficult for the coffee to drain, but it sounds like that's not what's happening in your particular case.</p>

Having used this method for many years now I think it gives consistently good coffee, comparable to that from a good espresso machine but without the need for machinery or paper filters.</p>

<p><strong>Recipe:</strong> Bring one cup's worth of water to a boil in a small pot. Add about a scoop and a half of ground decent-quality beans to the pot. Swirl gently until chalky bubbles appear. Filter through a tea strainer into a cup. Let stand briefly. </p>

<p>No need to grind the beans to a powder. The tea-strainer gets most of the grounds and the amount of sediment in the cup is about the same as in cafe espresso. The only electric component is a coffee grinder. Using pre-ground beans requires more coffee per cup, as some flavor will be missing.</p>

<p>In general this method produces coffee that is slightly weaker than espresso. While I might add a bit of sugar to espresso to counter bitterness if the beans are old or mediocre, the strainer method above gives coffee that is very drinkable without sugar. </p>

<p>It sometimes surprises me that this simple method isn't more widely used. <strong>Has anyone else tried it?</strong> Are there any drawbacks to this method? It isn't worth much commercially because it only makes decent coffee one cup at a time.  </p>

<p>This method is adapted from one I saw used by fisherman in Brazil, except he used a sock instead of a tea strainer. Comments welcome.</p>
","<p>The biggest drawback is that you might add the grounds to too hot water. Especially avoid adding the coffee to water that is still boiling. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_preparation#Boiling"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia</a> has some references about the temperature and it states that boiling water will extract bitterness instead of aromatic oils. So just make sure to wait a moment after taking the water off boil.</p>

<p>Second drawback is that since the grounds remain in the pot in contact with the water, you have to empty the pot entirely once the coffee is ""done"". Leaving the grounds in contact with the water for longer times will only add betterness to the coffee. Of course this is no problem if you only make one cup, but prepare to have a (pre-heated) container ready if making more cups.</p>

<p>Related to the second drawback is that the extraction will continue in your cup because of the sediment, but in my opinion most people will not even notice it affecting the cup.</p>

"How many plants are needed to brew a cup of coffee?","343","","<p>I am curious. How many coffee plants do I need to harvest for beans in order to brew myself one cup of coffee (7g of ground, processed beans).</p>

<p>If it is less than one, then how many cups of coffee can I theoretically brew from one plant?</p>
","<p>It all boils down to three questions:
1) Yield = How much did you get from the grounds?
2) Strength = How much ended up in the cup?
3) Ratio = What did you get there?</p>

<p>Yield: Yield pertains to how much soluble you took from the coffee grounds. Ground coffee has something between 27-30% of its mass being soluble, that is, stuff you can dissolve in water. If you kept boiling and boiling coffee grounds in water, eventually you’d get everything that the grounds have to give. Above 22-24%, however, and you’ve essentially reached too far or squeezed too hard, because unpleasant flavors will emerge. Below 18%, and you’re not getting enough out of the coffee, at worst, leaving the coffee with underdeveloped flavors or simply wasting coffee. So it sort of answers the question, “How much did you get from the grounds?”</p>

<p>Strength: Pertains to how much of the final brew is coffee, and how much is water. SCAA Golden Cup says 1.15-1.35% brew strength is a desirable zone to the most number of people, though we espresso-lovers tend to like a bit more… something like 1.3-1.5% brew strength. Over 1.5, up to 2.0% or more, and you’re in the “heavy, thick” coffee zone. Simply put,“How much ended up in the cup?”</p>

<p>Ratio: Simply, grams per liter. It provides one of the major answers to the question that Yield and Strength might ask, that is, “How did you get there?” Perhaps the most easy-to-remember ratio is 60g/L, or 60 grams of coffee for every one liter of water. The fact that you can make a balanced, pleasing, delicious cup of coffee at 60 g/L should give any barista pause when they’re finding that they’re using 80 grams or more per liter when they’re making coffee. Is it “wrong” to make coffee at 90 g/L? No… but is the additional 50% of coffee yielding an additional 50% of coffee quality, compared to the barista down the street making superb coffee at 60 g/L?</p>

"Is Starbucks a fast-food like coffee company?","337","","<p>Well actually it is obvious that they are pretty fast.

I do realize it depends on the type and flavour of coffee but , anyway .. </p>

<p>I , buy at least 1 cup coffee from Starbucks a day , usually Filter coffee without milk or Americano. Should I stop shopping with them ?</p>

<p>Basicly , I'm asking if it is unhealthy to frequently drink filter coffee(without milk) or Americano from Starbucks , like if it is real coffee or something artificial ?</p>
","<p>As far as actual speed, that based mainly on the barista working shift, the load, and amount of available equipment.  Starbucks does not have any patented magic equipment that  lets them pull shots faster than any other coffee house (that I am aware of).  </p>

<p>If you enjoy their beverages, then there probably isn't any reason you shouldn't continue to drink it.  I would guess you are in the minority of people buy what amounts to black coffee from Starbucks.  Starbucks is a fairly divisive brand among most consumers.  Most of the people I have talked to that like their beverages are buying mixed drinks from them and not straight espresso, drip coffee or americanos.  </p>

<p>Starbucks does sell organic, fair trade and the like specialty coffees as whole bean or ground.  However, the vast majority of their beverages sold daily is likely made with whatever their ""espresso"" blend is.  My personal opinion is that it's horrible and over roasted.   However, it's also consistently the same tasting and consumed on a fairly mass scale daily, so if there were any inherent dangers to it, we'd likely all be aware by now.</p>

<p>As a brand, Starbucks is mainly aimed at consistency.  In general, that's what fast food chains strive for as well, so in that respect, they are very similar.  Proper branding ensures that you can buy a product at any of hundreds of locations (or thousands) and it will taste the same.  However, many consumers prize quality and uniqueness over consistency.  In most industries (distilling, wine, food, beer) the most expensive and ""highest end products"" are items that were perhaps only produced at a limited run, or were very good in a particular year.  That mindset tends to be the antithesis of the mass produced ""good enough for everyone"" standards that huge market brands set for themselves.  </p>

<p><strong>TL;DR Summary:</strong>  Yes, Starbucks shares many characteristics with fast food companies.  The most notable aspect being their branding strategies and tactics.    </p>

I assume we are talking about morning coffee and not about something that helps to pull you through the night of studying.

Many of machines allow you to preset the wake up time, so that you prepare everything at night, and then you wake in the morning to a ready cup (or two) of coffee waiting for you.</p>

<p>If you actually care about taste and want something that won't just give you a kick in the head, but actually be a pleasurable experience - buy real whole bean coffee, and grind it yourself.  </p>

<p>As to a way to make coffee - that is a purely opinion based question. Some people love espresso. I like my french press.  Some love their morning cappuccino, etc.  You have to experiment and find your drink of choice. 
But the first best thing you can do, is to buy a whole bean coffee and grind it yourself.  The taste difference (specially after an instant coffee) will be enormous!</p>

","<p>Because coffee and other stimulants do not supply ""energy"" - they cause your body to use its energy reserves a greater or prolonged rate than it normally would.</p>

Yet pretty much every website I've seen about French press recommends something around these lines, or more. Also - and more importantly - I've tried lowering the amount and it does taste thin.</p>

<p>YET... I do enjoy for instance K-cup coffee, which is around 10g/cup. Does it mean the French press is not economical at all? </p>
","<p>I think K-cup is <em>[impolite negative opinion]</em> and an absurdly overpriced fad, but I get perfectly decent French press with a scant 2 tablespoons of beans (I don't weigh them, but I'd guess a lot less than you are using - one calculator claims about half.) I can waste more in the FP but it does not really make it better, and if I take two cups off the same grounds, the second one is always inferior, so I just pared down what I was putting in until the first cup was still good, and clean it out and put in a second cup's worth for the second cup (need to dig the big one out of storage one of these days, it would be more efficient.)</p>

<p>We were not really fancy coffee people. The cones were quick and easy (and storable in a cupboard, unlike a coffee machine). The coffee was tasty. For that matter, I still use a Melitta cone when I go camping. So my question is: <em>why did pour-over coffee become such a big deal?</em> Is it just that the barista is making you a bespoke cup from scratch instead of pouring it from the urn? Or has there been some advancement in the state of the art in the last thirty years?</p>
","<p>Pour over systems give you the ability to control the water flow through the coffee grounds with a high level of precision whereas a drip brewer does not.  </p>

<p>I will admit, this is a bit of a trend, but there are very real differences in the taste of a pour over versus a drip brewed cup of coffee.</p>

<ul>
<li>Blooming -- Gets rid of trapped Co2.  Easy to do in a pour over, whereas in a drip brewer, I don't believe the grounds are allowed to bloom.  If you don't let the Co2 offgas, you get metallic flavors in the cup.  Typically not really a problem since the majority of the gas is gone inside 12-24 hours anyways, but pour over allows you to completely optimize this.</li>
<li>Cleanliness of cup -- pour overs are known for producing a very clean cup of coffee, that allows you to highlight the top notes in a coffee like florals or fruit flavors.  This is the polar opposite from French Press, and drip brewers either use paper filters that aren't pre-soaked so may relay a papery flavor to the coffee, or use a metal filter which will allow quite a bit more coffee oil through the filter and thus muddy the cup (slightly).</li>
<li>Grounds saturation -- Typically drip brewers don't have a very good spray head in the drip brewer, so many times you can get a filter of grounds where the center is indented after brewing and the outer grounds may not even be wet in some cases.  Obviously, grounds not wet is a bad thing.  The indentation is also a bad thing.  It basically means that more water is being passed through the center of the filter than elsewhere which means you don't get even extraction.</li>
<li>Timing -- You don't want to pass water through the grounds too fast, nor too slow.  The reasoning for this is variable solubility rates of different compounds in the coffee.  Case in point, if you grind really coarse and 'brew' your coffee in 1 minute, what's going to happen is the citric and malic acids in the coffee grounds will extract very easily and the other more complex flavor compounds will stay in the ground.  This is going to produce a sour cup of coffee.  Pour over allows you to make minute adjustments to ground saturation timing that can produce some wild flavors in a cup of coffee.</li>
</ul>

<p>All this being said.. I still use a drip brewer for my morning cup of coffee because I'm usually running out the front door trying to get to work.  Does my drip brewer produce a good cup of coffee?  Absolutely.  Can I get a better cup of coffee with a pour over?  Probably.  It's simply a quality / time trade off.</p>

It claims to include a set of fine sieves to separate ground coffee into finer levels.</p>

<p>I thought it may be beneficial, mostly for Turkish coffee and in general, to systematically determine the levels of grind for any method.</p>

<p>What would sieving or separating coffee do to the final flavor of the cup?</p>
","<p>In all coffee-brewing methods, consistency is key. Different particle sizes of coffee will extract at different rates and controlling extraction rates and replicating them is part of making better and better cups of coffee.</p>

<p>The Rafino seems to be tailored more towards the filter or french press brewer. In these brewing methods, fines, the smaller coffee particles produce the majority of the problem in extraction and off-flavours produced in the end cup. With filter brewing, it restricts water flow and can cause inconsistencies in the extraction. With french press, the fines can overextract due to the full immersion process and cause a lot more bitter flavours to be present.</p>

<p>Filtering out inconsistent coffee grounds results in a much more evenly extracted coffee as the majority of grounds will extract more uniformly without any under or over extracting much more than the rest. This should give a much more balanced and bodied cup assuming other variables are as diligently controlled.</p>

<p>Better grinders can minimise fines but an extra step can ensure particle size consistency. However I'm not sure about the extent of adverse effects of exposing ground coffee to air for so long would be to which I would suggest minimising grounds-sifting time.</p>

I have a very rare and expensive coffee bean that I'd like to take out once a month or so on special occasions, and I'm trying to see if there's anyway to do this without buying the coffee new every time.</p>
","<p>Coffee beans, once roasted, are perishable; they don't ""keep"". Within roughly five days of roasting staleness is detectable (taste/quality is adversely affected). There is one way to preserve freshness: consume freshly roasted beans within roughly a week. Don't freeze; beans absorb moisture and lose flavour— ick. Vacuum packs aren't the answer, either. To remove all gases from packaging would require a system using pressure, 29"" Hg, that no one, not even coffee giants, can afford. The best practice is to just buy beans (roasted on the day you purchase, ideally) in quantities you'll use within a week to 10 days. </p>

"Why is coffee mostly hot brewed?","286","","<p><strong>Why is coffee always made with hot water ?</strong></p>

<p>I know there is iced coffee, but even in this case, coffee must be made with boiled water before.</p>

<p>My simple coffee machine heats water into vapor, then rises it to the top of the machine to fill the filter and turns to coffee. It's obvious that it's impossible to do this with cold water and a traditional machine. But if it was, would the taste be the same as of a cooled traditional coffee ?</p>
","<p>Let's take a look at what turns coffee grounds and water into coffee:</p>

<p>It's an extraction process where aromatic compounds and oils and caffeine are extracted from the coffee bean into the water. It's a ""standard chemical process"", done in millions of kitchens and cafés all over the world.</p>

<p>Basic chemistry will tell you that the temperature of the solvent and other environmental parameters like pressure typically determine how fast this happens, but also the ratios of extracted substances, if applicable. Surface area comes into play as well, that's why e.g. coffee for espresso machines is ground finer than for filter machines. Using the same batch of beans in an espresso machine and a drip coffee maker gives you two <em>totally different</em> taste profiles.</p>

<p>The same applies for extraction processes that use <strong>cold water</strong>, a method termed ""cold brew"" and <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/search?q=Cold%20brew"">discussed on this site</a> as well. By the same rules as explained before, this means you need significantly longer extraction times (we are talking <em>hours</em> here) and should expect a different taste.</p>

"French-press v.s. manual pour over brewing quality","284","","<p>Does anyone happen to know the differences in brewing quality of using a french press v.s. using a manual pour over? I can imagine using filter paper might give a better quality brew with a manual pour over than with the french press' metal mesh filter but I could be wrong.</p>
","<p>It's relatively difficult to define quality differences without knowing how you're grinding it.</p>

<p>Grinding may be the most influential aspect in your case. If you're grinding with just a basic blade grinder, your grounds are extremely inconsistent. Regardless of your brewing method, your result will be quite different from the results of a grinder with better consistency. The reason has to do with the amount of extraction happening over [time] in relation to the coffee's surface area. If the grounds are large, the surface area is less, so the total extraction per [time] is less. If the grounds are very fine, the surface area is greater, so the total extraction per [time] becomes greater. When your grounds are consistent, you can prepare coffee with greater accuracy. However, if some of your grounds are huge, others medium and others fine, then you have very little control over accuracy, and you sort of have to choose between under-extraction for watery results with less undesirables, or over-extraction for fuller results with more undesirables.</p>

<p>If you are using a blade grinder, I recommend over-grinding for more consistent results. Then just shorten your brew time in order to not over-extract.</p>

<p>In the event that you're using a pretty decent grinder, then how coarse/fine you're grinding the coffee is probably the second most influential aspect. If your grounds are fine, then more grounds are likely to pass through the plunger, and you'll also have to put more force on the plunger, possibly pushing even more grounds through. The more grounds that pass through lengthen the total extraction, even after you pour it out. To be honest, this usually makes a small difference that <em>most</em> people cannot detect it, and those who can do not often care. So relatively speaking, in this case the pour-over may be considered the better option. However, if you're grinder can produce evenly coarse grounds, with little to no powder, then the french press is an equally good method.</p>

<p>Lastly, there is a notable difference in the flavor between the two. It is said that the coffee from a french-press ""clogs"" your taste buds. And most people can taste the cleaner/thinner quality of coffee that's been filtered through paper. But at the end of the day, it's preference. I have a coffee snob friend who only drinks french press, and another who only drinks pour-over. I enjoy them both.</p>

"What purpose have those grooves inside the dripper?","284","","<p>I'm using the V60 dripper from Hario and was curious about the grooves inside the dripper. I think that they are present to slow down the water running through the filter and let the water pass as much as coffee powder as possible, but I'm not really sure. Is this really the intention of this grooves?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pkFso.jpg"" alt=""Dripper""></p>
","<p>These grooves are for improving the flow of coffee through the filter. The grooves create space between the filter and the cone to permit little channels for the coffee to flow into the vessel after passing through the filter paper. I think the ridges also help ""wick"" the coffee away from the filter paper, helping the filter paper drain better.  </p>

<p>If the ridges are absent (as in Chemex cones, for example) the brewed coffee sometimes wells up between the filter paper and the cone. See also <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/1658/262"">this question</a> and <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/1660/262"">my answer that compares the two styles of cones</a>. </p>

<p>As for the shape and location of the grooves, some are spiral-shaped, others are straight, staggered, etc. I don't notice any advantage of any style as long as they're present, and I suspect the shape and location is purely aesthetic or marketing, not significantly different in any functional way.  </p>

"How can I produce better espresso shots with my Gaggia Classic?","281","","<p>I just bought an espresso machine, Gaggia Classic.I tried making an espresso from pre-ground coffee with the pressurised filter (Crema Perfetta) that comes with the machine and I found the coffee was extracted quite fast. For example, within 10 seconds I already get 30 ml of espresso from 7 grams of pre-ground coffee. Despite having beautiful crema, the coffee tasted sour. Did I do anything wrong? The dosing I used was generally recommended for a single shot of espresso, but I used the 2-cup pressurised filter instead of the other smaller one that's said to be for PODs. <strong>Question 1</strong>: Any recommendations for getting a better shot of espresso from these things that I already have?</p>

<p>I also would like to try the non-pressurised filter selling online as it's claimed to produce better quality espresso. I have learned that this kind of filter is commercially used with commercial machines that generate the brewing pressure at 9 bars. But my Gaggia classic is 15 bars, based on the specification document. <strong>Question 2</strong>: Will this higher pressure result in faster extraction when I use a non-pressurised filter? I have learned that there are other factors that help slow down the extraction time such as tamping and grinding size, but <strong>Question 3</strong>: Will these factors be significant enough to overcome the 15 bars? I don't want to modify anything in the machine like adjusting the brew pressure of which the method is shown on the internet.Thank you for your comments and answers. I'm totally new to making espresso myself, but I really love espresso.</p>

<ul>
<li>dose</li>
<li>time</li>
<li>tamping</li>
</ul>

<p>Dosage is more or less stable in between 6 to 8 grams. Time is mostly the variable that decides either you produce a spectrum of drinks from ristretto to cafe creme.

"Is there any way to overcome cycling with a moka on an induction stove?","281","","<p>In my eternal quest to make a decent cup of coffee at my parents' house, with an induction stove and moka, I recently discovered an interesting problem.</p>

<p>Having found a good heat setting for the hob (that doesn't superheat the water instantly and boil it dry in ~20 seconds), I found that the hob attempts to maintain thermostatis by cycling the power on and off. This may work fine for a large pot of boiling water, but for the moka pot this means I get a few seconds of extraction, followed by a few seconds of water <em>being sucked back down the wrong way</em> as the pressure decreases, then forwards, then back, etc.</p>

<p>Is there any way of overcoming this? Is it even likely to cause a problem with the extraction?</p>
","<p>As far as my experience with Moka pots, I don't have them on the stove for long. Something that I got in that habit of doing when using moka pots is to boil the water before I put it in the Moka pot, then introducing it to heat, then removing shortly after it starts to percolate. Stumptown illustrates a similar method.</p>

<p>As for the induction stove cycling to maintain a steady temp, if you set the temperature over boiling(212F, but may differ by altitude) it likely won't cycle. This is because water will not exceed boiling point, under most circumstances, in a liquid state. For instance water is often used to prevent things from burning, because it keeps the temperature below the boiling temperature until all the water is evaporated. So if you set the induction stove to above the water's boiling point it will likely not exceed that temperature. It might take a bit to find a sweet spot. Though I'm not sure, I have never used an induction stove with a moka pot.</p>

<h3>UPDATE:</h3>

<p>Something I had not considered is the boiling point increases with pressure. So it might be worth turning the heat up quite a bit beyond 212F/100C. Its pretty difficult to burn water. Then again if you're using an induction stove to avoid heat pollution on the moka pot, then you can just use a traditional stove with the method I described and avoid the need to use an induction stove.</p>

"Why does instant coffee need more milk/sugar to get desired taste?","281","","<p>This morning I brewed some coffee at work using a <a href=""https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/pour-over"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pour-over</a> and noticed that the amount of milk and sugar required to get the desired taste and whiteness was significantly less. </p>

<p>I do not mean because it tastes better it needs less, <em>the amount of milk and sugar needed was less</em>. Is this due to the density of instant coffee which requires it to have more for the taste to be recognizable? Or is there more to it?</p>
","<p>The answer is subjective, and even if we agree on taste, it will still be unclear, because reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>The instant coffee, unless it's Starbucks or some other name brand, will most likely be made of <em>Robusta</em> varietal beans, which are widely known to taste far worse than the <em>Arabica</em> beans you will find used for pourovers. (Interesting fact: Robusta contains roughly 3 times the amount of caffeine than <em>Arabica</em> beans do, by weight.)</li>
<li>Instant coffee is essentially coffee concentrate. Remember how concentrated orange juice tastes.</li>
<li>Before becoming instant coffee, the beans may have been roasted more heavily than one would normally like, in order to remove any distinguishing flavors, and to create a uniform flavor profile. Remember-- most people who buy instant coffee drink it for the caffeine, and don't care about the flavor. In fact, if there is a distinct flavor, they may hate it.</li>
<li>To add to those points: the more heavily roasted my coffee is, the more cream/sugar I must add to make it drinkable. Your mileage may vary.</li>

<p>Now that I have a chance to actually see what I'm getting before I get it, what should I look for in a fresh bean as far as quality? Are there characteristics that I can look for which indicate that (if properly roasted) the bean will produce something good?

"Should I press the coffee into my espresso machine?","278","","<p>The other day, I was watching an interview with an award-winning barista about how he prepared the award-winning cup of coffee. </p>

<p>When he was putting the coffee into the coffee basket, he was also using some kind of stamp, saying that the best pressure to apply is 22.5 kilograms when pressing onto the coffee. </p>

<p>Well, I was not doing anything like that until then. When I tried (because the award-winning barista is doing it), my espresso machine could not handle the amount of coffee I did put in there and instead of a coffee stream was producing coffee drips.</p>

<p>Now, to the question - my home espresso machine (Kenwood Kmix) should handle 16 bars of pressure, but is far away from professional device.</p>

<p><strong>Should one apply pressure when filling coffee to espresso machine?</strong></p>

<p>And if yes, how much?</p>
","<p>The process of compressing the coffee powder in a portafilter of an espresso machine before pulling the shot is called <strong>tamping</strong>. There is a lot of information available on the web explaining how it is done correctly, such as, e.g., <a href=""http://www.coffeeresearch.org/espresso/tamping.htm"">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Tamping is an important part of making a good espresso shot, so yes, you should press the coffee in the portafilter.</strong></p>

<p>The reason for compressing the coffee powder is to allow the pump to build up the pressure needed for brewing espresso correctly. If you don't tamp it, there is typically not enough resistance and the water rushes through the portafilter too quickly, resulting in underextraction of the coffee powder (and hence, suboptimal taste). Furthermore, a good tamp prevents <strong>channelling</strong>, where the water does not flow well-distributed through the coffee powder.</p>

<p>If the coffee drips too slowly when you tamp, a couple of things can be tried:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tamp with less force. The correct pressure depends on the coffee powder, the diameter of the portafilter, etc. - so 22.5 kgs may simply not be right for your combination of machine and powder.</li>
<li>Grind your coffee less fine - this will lower the resistance.</li>
<li>Change your beans. In my experience, lighter roasts cause more resistance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Options two and three are only listed for the sake of completeness - normally the tamper force is adapted to the other variables, and not the other way around. A good espresso making tutorial should give you a starting point on how to find the correct tamping force and grind coarseness level for your combination of beans and machine. Also, if you own an espresso machine and never heard of tamping, you may want to read one anyway.</p>

","<p>You'll definitely get a less bitter and possibly sour (underextracted) brew when dividing up one 40g dose between two V60s <em>if you don't adjust the grind</em>.</p>

<p>As you point out, the lower contact time of the 20g of grinds will lead to less extraction, and thus less bitterness, and possibly under extraction.

"What influence do the dry residuals of previous coffee in the cup have on the drinking experience?","276","","<p>At work I usually drink coffee (multiple times daily) from a metallic cup which I actually never ever wash on the inside. This leads to the building of interesting dust-like coffee residuals. While this started out of mere laziness, I meanwhile deliberately refrain from washing it as the result is visually quite appealing and an interesting long-term endeavour to see how that coffee cup evolves over the years.</p>

<p>I am however wondering <strong>if those residuals actually have any kind of influence on the fresh coffee drank from this cup</strong>. Now of course there isn't anything moulding, it's an entirely dry thin dust layer, and I don't really make out any taste difference to a clean cup (as the coffee isn't too much of a high quality product in the first place and I'm not a big tasting expert either). So this might be a stupid question. But for example I heard somewhere (though, that's entirely anecdotal hearsay, too) that you shouldn't wash a tea can with dishwasher but only with water because of some flavoury reasons. So maybe there is actual proper or even scientifically grounded reasoning that the <strong>dry residuals of previous coffee in the cup have any kind of influence on the coffee drinking experience, however small and imperceptible, be that flavour-wise or regarding other effects, advantageous or defective</strong>.</p>
","<p>You're actually asking two different questions. </p>

<p>The minute amount of coffee left to evaporate in the bottom of a cup will have completely oxidized and lost virtually all of its volatile compounds (i.e. It probably wouldn't taste very good if you reconstituted it on its own). So when you add more <em>fresh</em> coffee to that cup, yes, you are essentially adding a minute amount of an external (and somewhat <em>off</em>) flavor component to your brew.</p>

<p>Now whether that flavor component contributes to any any <strong><em>perceptible</em></strong> change in flavor is highly debatable. Line up 100 coffee drinkers in a blind tasting, and I suspect there would be no statistically significant detection between <em>""100% fresh""</em> and <em>""Christian's 0.083% dust-like coffee residuals.""</em></p>

<p>Your analogy to washing tea cans in a dishwasher is a bit off. Washing containers in a dishwasher is generally known to leave a perceptible taste of <em>soap</em> on the container. Soap is completely foreign to the coffee-tasking experience so it is easily <em>tasted</em> if it is present. But the residuals you are leaving behind in your unwashed-coffee-cup study are still <em>essentially</em> coffee (somewhat <em>off</em> coffee, but coffee nonetheless). So mixing the equivalent of ""a few drops"" of <em>off</em> coffee in a hot cup of fresh I suspect will have no <em>perceptible</em> effect on taste. </p>

<p>I also suspect that your coffee cup experiment is <em>not</em> evolving over the years. The metallic cup is likely stainless steel or perhaps aluminum (and most coffee cups are made of ceramic). In either case, the cup is largely <em>stainless</em>, so you are not likely building up any patina&hellip; so you are essentially ""washing away"" the previous day's experiment each time you add a fresh cup of hot coffee. There should be no substantial, cumulative effect.</p>

"How to order Caffe Macchiato and be sure you get one?","275","","<p>I think this question pertains mostly to the USA.</p>

<p>I travel often and like to stop at local coffee shops. My beverage of choice is a Caffe Macchiato. In the US, there seems to be the issue that a ""Macchiato"" at Starbucks is something different from an actual Macchiato. </p>

<p>From Wikipedia, this is what I consider a Macchiato:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Caffè macchiato, sometimes called espresso macchiato, is an espresso coffee drink with a small amount of milk, usually foamed.
  [...] The caffè macchiato has the highest ratio of espresso to milk of any drink made with those ingredients.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have run into this a few times, even at coffee shops that seem to make a big deal about their coffee knowledge etc. I order a Macchiato, and receive a huge cup with mostly milk and some espresso. </p>

<p>I would like to be clear as to what I want when I order, but I also want to avoid sounding like a jerk if I specify exactly what I want, or sounding dumb if I describe the drink rather than ordering by its name. What is a good way of achieving this?</p>
","<p>The problem with ordering a ""Macchiato"" is that it's only <em>half</em> of the name of a traditional coffee drink.</p>

<p>""Macchiato"" means ""stained"" or ""flecked"" and not more.</p>

<p>In Italy, you have either </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Latte macchiato:</strong> *Milk ""stained"" with coffee (more precisely caffè or espresso) or</li>
<li><strong>Espresso macchiato:</strong> Espresso (or caffè) ""stained"" with a spoonful of milk foam.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you order a ""Macciato"" without qualifier, you will either get what the chain defines as such (for Starbucks, a lot of milk and foam with one or multiple shots of espresso) or what your barista thinks of first - and that would often be a (<em>latte</em>) macchiato, i.e. a glass of milk and foam with an espresso layer inbetween. </p>

<p>So my recommendation is:</p>

<p>If you want a serving of espresso with a bit of milk, order an <strong><em>espresso</strong> macchiato</em>. I just double-checked with the Starbucks US website and yes, they do have espresso macchiato on the menu. Any decent barista from the (self proclaimed) high-end places you mention should be familiar with these terms anyway. The fine difference between ""coffee"" and ""caffè"" (see below) might be ""lost in translation"" and they will be using an espresso machine in 99% of all cases anyway.</p>

<p>(Coffee produced on Bali is generally Robusta rather than Arabica which means it has more caffeine, but I would like to know about the change in caffeine due to the process alone)</p>
","<p>The amount of caffeine in your cup will depend, as with any method, on the extraction time. It also depends on everything else, e.g. the grind, temperature of the water, but I can't find any information on what these typically are for Balinese coffee, so I'm going to assume they're the same.</p>

<p>Assuming you're using the same coffee with each method, the main thing that will vary is the extraction time. With pour-over methods, this will depend on the size and shape of the funnel, the porousness of the filter paper and the grind itself.</p>

<p>For Balinese coffee, there is no control. If you mix the coffee and water directly, the only thing limiting the extraction time is how long you wait before drinking it.</p>

<p>However, having said that, caffeine is actually extracted rather quickly. <a href=""http://www.pjbs.org/pjnonline/fin2208.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">This study</a> finds that routine percolation removes almost all soluble caffeine. However, the extended extraction time for Balinese coffee is likely to make a bitter brew.</p>

"Yemenite tea-like coffee?","264","","<p>I was in Yemen a few years ago, and when ordering ""Yemenite Coffee"" there, one would get a cup with a liquid which tasted like coffee, but from the intensity, color and strength was more like tea.</p>

<p>I was told the coffee was made from the peelings of the coffee beans (because all the beans are determined for export).</p>

<p>Is it true that they brew their coffee with the peelings of roasted coffee beans? How exactly is this kind of coffee made? Does it have a special name? Are there similar kinds of drinks?</p>
","<p>It sounds like you had <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_cherry_tea"">coffee cherry tea</a>, also called <em>cascara</em>, and regionally other names; in Yemen it seems to be called <em>qishr</em> according to Wikipedia. </p>

<p>It's (to me) delicious, but rather different than roasted, brewed coffee beans. It has a lovely red hue, similar to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooibos"">rooibos</a> but lighter. </p>

<p>It's made by infusing the dried coffee cherries or just the husks (as you described in the question). It is steeped like an herbal tea, in hot water just off the boil. <a href=""http://www.benttreecoffee.com/allcoffees/cascara-coffee-cherry-tea"">This article</a> says that it can be brewed using cold-brew techniques also.

"Why do barista's keep activating the doser whilst grinding coffee","262","","<p>I notice that some barista's keep whacking the doser on the coffee grinder when they fill the espresso holder. What's the theory behind this?</p>

<p>I would've thought that the fact that the coffee is being ground and falling into the holder that it is being aerated enough already so why do this?</p>

<p>This may be something to do with specific grinder models, it may be just the lever to release coffee, I don't know but would like to hear from someone who knows better than me.</p>
","<p><strong>Short reason:</strong> Tradition conflicting with modern brewing practices.</p>

<p><strong>Long reason:</strong> This is more a result of an industry-wide legacy when purchasing equipment, where coffee shop owners will pick up mechanically dosed grinders instead of doserless, or electrically metered models because ""that's how it's been done,"" or because the technology simply wasn't  affordable until simple microcontrollers became cheap. </p>

<p><em>Traditionally,</em> you would grind enough coffee to fill the doser, dispensing grounds for brewing as needed and refilling the doser when the level dropped too low.  Dosers exist to allow for predictably size quantities of grounds to be dispensed into the portafilter, and that's basically it.  </p>

<p>This, however, conflicts with the ""Third Wave"" coffee culture, where flavor and texture are paramount.  In this new culture, coffee beans are ground for immediate use, rather than drawing from a bin.  The moment beans are ground, the gasses contained within (gasses that are the reason Crema exist) are allowed every opportunity to escape.  The longer they sit, the less gasses will be left behind by the time they're used to brew.  </p>

<p>So when a Third Wave coffee shop grinds using a doser, the Barista rapid-fires the dosing lever, essentially moving the coffee straight into the portafilter.</p>

<p>A better plan is just to use a direct-dosing grinder where the grounds are metered by time or weight straight into the filter.  Advances in the packaging options for load cell sensors and simple controllers have made this somewhat common in both consumer and commercial equipment.</p>

"How are coffee beans differentiated?","261","","<p>Tea grown in Sri Lanka is classified by elevation into high, mid and low grown tea. </p>

<ul>
<li>High: rich in flavor </li>
<li>Mid: blend of flavor and aroma </li>
<li>Low: rich aroma</li>
</ul>

<p>Does coffee has such differentiation? If so what are they?</p>
","<p>It is important to have in mind that altitude is not the only feature that allows one to differentiate the coffee beans. Temperature is perhaps even more important (altitude influences in the temperatures suffered by a coffee plant, but not all the same altitudes mean the same temperature profiles).</p>

<p>As a brief summary (taken from <sup>[1]</sup>), we can say that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lower elevations (Robusta variety) mean a more intensely coffee flavoured bean (more caffeine).</li>
<li>Higher elevations (Arabica variety) mean more acid and complex taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, the main factor is the variety of coffee. The elevation and temperature only tell you what of these varieties you can successfully grow and how you can harvest it.</p>

<hr>

<p>According to this source <sup>[2]</sup>: <a href=""http://www.scribblerscoffee.com/flavor_effect_of_altitude"">The Effect of Altitude on Coffee Flavor</a>, that relates only to the Arabica variety, can be summarized as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Altitude contributes to a coffee taste profile.</li>
<li>Ideal growing conditions for the coffee tree:
<ul>
<li>At the coffee belt (a band extending approximately 30° north and south of equator).</li>
<li>At high elevations, between 3,000 and 6,000 feet and beyond.</li>
<li>These conditions provide a frost-free climate.</li>
<li>Averaging 60°F to 70°F year round.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cooler mountains provide a slower growth cycle for coffee tree.
<ul>
<li>This means deeper and more interesting flavours (due to a longer maturation process).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Better drainage of soils means less water in the fruit.
<ul>
<li>Further concentration of flavours.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>More fertile the soil, the better.
<ul>
<li>A volcanic soil is often preferred.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The farther we are from the coffee belt, the less elevation we must grow coffee tree in order to avoid low temperatures.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a more specific summary:</p>

<ul>
<li>Generally speaking, more elevation implies a more pronounced and distinctive flavour profile:
<ul>
<li>From the simple, mild and subtle of those grown at 2,000 feet.</li>
<li>To a fruit, spice, floral profile for those grown at 5,000 feet or above (when possible).</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Just add plain water to top your cup off</li>
<li>repeat the entire process (new filter, new grounds and water)</li>
<li>Once empty just add more water on top of the grounds that you just used. (This is the method I use.)</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>In terms of overall taste, what is the best way to get a full cup of coffee from an AeroPress?</strong></p>
","<p>My personal preference is to just add a bit of water to top my cup off.  I do not use the inverted method, and by adding additional water during the brewing (since I tend to get just a bit of drippage during brewing) I tend to end up with pretty close to a full cup.  </p>

<p>However, if you are looking for a much stronger (pseudo espresso) cup, the second method may be for you.  It has only really the drawback of using an additional sum of coffee and filter.  </p>

<p>I would not recommend using the 3rd method.  At that point you are just headed to over extracted grounds and a less desirable (by most people) cup of coffee.  </p>

<p>To sum up, you are looking at producing a cup sized quantity of good coffee with method one, a cup sized quantity of Aerpresso with the second and a cup sized quantity of likely over extracted coffee with method three.  Any of these may be fine depending on what you are trying to achieve.   </p>

<p>The problem is that percolation and brewing are not just about coffee: Both terms are generic. Percolation sounds more technical and focusing on liquid getting through a filter.

<p>Are there any downsides because of the high pressure? Does it alter the taste? Would I get more crema if I reduced the pressure?</p>
","<p>A higher pressure is fine, as long as it is a controlled variable. You may have to tamp harder or start with a finer grind in order to accommodate the higher pressure. The increase in pressure otherwise would cause a faster brewing time and ergo underextraction of the coffee puck.</p>

"Why does coffee lose caffeine as it is roasted?","244","","<p>I have heard that coffee actually loses caffeine as you roast it, which means darker blends have less caffeine. Why is this?</p>
","<p>This is a very common misconception.  Coffee does not lose caffeine as it is roasted.  It is often misunderstood that darker roasts have less caffeine. Caffeine's melting point is 455F which is well above what most beans reach during the roasting process. Essentially, caffeine content changes because the mass/density of the beans change (they lose water and undergo changes in the roasting process). If you measure your coffee by volume, dense greener beans will have more caffeine. If you measure by weight, darker roasted beans will have more caffeine.  The total amount of caffeine in a batch of beans changes very little, if any.</p>

","<p>Stirring should be used if the grounds were not evenly dispersed in the beginning of the process for some reason (in immersion brewing methods).  For instance, when I am using my pour over at work, if my initial pour leaves some dry spots floating on top.  The Aeropress uses stirring prior to extraction presumably because the short time combined with the tube shape (narrow with all the grounds at the bottom) demand a good mixing.  I've seen many badly designed drip brewers that leave a chunk of dry grounds in the basket when done.  This is because the drip isn't dispersing water evenly and some of the grounds end up wasted,  finer grind, longer brew and temp won't necessarily help bad engineering in that case.</p>

"Brewing 900 Cups of Coffee (In 24 Hours)?","230","","<p>I'm helping organize a big 24-hour event and as a big coffee drinker, I got put in charge of the coffee.

Since this is outside the realm of what I normally do at home with a french press so I thought I better check that I'm not making any horrible mistakes.</p>

<p>One of our big concerns is that this event will likely have quite a few somewhat-discerning coffee drinkers. We also need to be able to brew coffee in the middle of the night when any local coffee shop has closed.</p>

<p>Is there a better approach? If a percolator is the right approach, what beans/grounds will produce the best flavor? How many lbs/kgs of coffee will likely be needed?</p>
","<p>Your problem depends more on the shape of the data than the raw quantities. 900 cups in 24 hours is one cup every 40 seconds or so, which isn't so bad, however I doubt that's the distribution of actual orders!</p>

<p>I'm going to assume all of your 300 guests want to have a cup of coffee during a one-hour period. This works out as 5 coffees a minute, or one every 12 seconds.</p>

<p>I'm ignoring factors of manpower, cost etc., and focussing on coffee preparation only :-)</p>

<p>You can get 12-cup french press pots very easily, and probably larger ones. Assuming each one takes ~6 minutes to cycle (prepare, brew for 4 mins, serve, rinse), meaning you can serve 2 people a minute with one pot. 3 pots would allow you to serve 6 people a minute (amortised) and serve 300 people in an hour. A few more pots would make it very comfortable. Assuming you're grinding the coffee fresh, you'll get a far superior brew from this than perk coffee that's been sitting there for 20 minutes.</p>

<p>So serving people fast enough shouldn't be too hard, but boiling water fast enough might be, and for that you just need an <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IgVDG.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">urn</a>, with which you can keep a large enough supply of boiling water to just fill up and go.</p>

<p>Thanks!!!</p>
","<p>After some time has passed and no one answered, yet. Maybe I can come up with an answer. The question is not clear and if I understood correctly, the answer is too broad. Therefore, I will try to elaborate my answer by summarizing factors that effects <em>the tag</em> of the question.</p>

<p><em>Note: Please leave comments as this is a quite broad answer.</em></p>

<p><strong>The species</strong></p>

<p>When we say coffee, we mention two different species of <em>Coffea</em> Genus. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffea_arabica"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Coffea arabica</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffea_canephora"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Coffea canephora</a> (aka robusta). They have many differences. Shortly, Arabica grows in the mountains, more expensive and has more oil (so flavor), less caffeine. Robusta grows in the seaside, less expensive and has less oil (so flavor), more caffeine. More detailed discussion can be followed under <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/116/what-is-the-difference-between-robusta-and-arabica"">this question</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The origin</strong></p>

<p>You grow this plant in different places. Location and cultivation affects the taste. So, the origin has effects on the flavor. You may hear ""Ethiopian arabica"" or ""Indonesian robusta"" quite often.</p>

<p><strong>The blend</strong></p>

<p>So, it comes the blend. After the harvest, the fruits are collected, dried and the beans are picked. When you collect different beans from all over the world, you blend them. Sometimes, single origin beans are used to taste the flavor as it is. Sometimes, they are blended to mix the effect of a variety of beans. Blends may be all arabica, all robusta or mixed.</p>

<p><strong>The Roast</strong></p>

<p>After the blend is prepared, roasting starts. During roasting normally up to 15% of the beans weight is dried out. This process is one of the main decisions based on personal preference, blend structure and the targeted drink. A list of coffee roast varieties can be found <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_roasting"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>. Note that there are also unlisted very very light roasts as in <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2432/how-to-create-green-coffee"">green coffee</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The grind</strong></p>

<p>Grinding is also closely related to the targeted drink. For example, the coffee must be as fine as powder for preparing Turkish coffee. On the other hand, such fine grinding is so unpractical in French press as the grains could easily travel through the filter.</p>

<p><strong>The Brew</strong></p>

<p>Choose a brewing method. As a subtitle, use proper equipment for that method. Master your brewing method. Needless to say, there are (probably) hundreds of them. I could enlist three main methods as: pressurized extraction, thermal extraction, and cold-brew methods.</p>

<p><strong>The service</strong></p>

<p>According to a questionnaire, baristas in Italy state that even pouring the espresso may affect the flavor. Apart from that, it is a known fact that the espresso cups must be pre-heated for a better experience. So, even serving the coffee is important.</p>

<p><strong>The freshness</strong></p>

<p>As a bonus article to the aforementioned ones, freshness. One should take car of the freshness of the coffee at each step. The beans themselves must not wait for years. After roasting, they should be degassed for two to three days before grinding. However, they should be consumed right after the grinding. There is a famous expression on that: <em>the customer not the espresso must wait</em>.

"Make my coffee stronger without equipment","227","","<p>I just had an espresso at a café, and it really put into perspective how weak my everyday coffee is. All the equipment I own is a blade grinder, and my method is a turkish brew (grind the beans, put them in the cup, pour-over some boiling water, wait for it to sink, done!).</p>

<p><strong>What can I do to get stronger coffee?</strong> And more precisely, what will make the <strong>most</strong> difference?</p>

<p>Note that I am not willing to buy any new equipment or machines; I'm asking about what I can do with what I've got.</p>

<p><strong>Update: tried adding grounds onto boiling water, instead of pouring water over grounds. Here's how it went:</strong></p>

<p>TL;DR: </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> No success, strength did not increase and taste just got worse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>What I did:</strong> 
I took my strongest beans, ground them as fine as possible, used two identical cups, divided the grounds into two equal portions (on a separate tray). I put grounds first, boiling water afterwards in the first cup, and did the same thing but backwards on the second one. I did not stir any of the cups after adding all ingredients. After quite some time I tasted both cups, I am now finishing them both up while programming.</p>

<p><strong>Observations:</strong>
The grounds on the ""water-first"" cup took a considerable time to sink into the liquid. Even after the brewing time had passed, much more grounds were floating around there than in the ""pour-over"" cup. Also, the water-first cup had almost no foam, which the pour-over cup had plenty of.</p>

<p><strong>Results:</strong>
The water-first cup was <strong>not</strong> stronger than the pour-over; if anything it tasted weaker. The taste was quite different too, water-first tasted a bit stale/watery (not much but there was a clear difference). Pour-over had a rounder and more full aroma, liked that one more. And the crema/foam <em>looked</em> a lot better on the pour-over as well.</p>
","<p>There are a few things you can do.</p>

<p>1) More beans.  More beans = more surface area = more extraction.</p>

<p>2) Grind finer.  It's tough to control grind size with a blade grinder, so if you really want a consistent, strong cup, you will eventually want to invest in a burr grinder.  But with a blade grinder, grind it longer.</p>

<p>3) This is the biggest: <em>don't use boiling water</em>. Optimal coffee extraction occurs at temperatures roughly between 185 and 202 degrees F.  You'll need to play with this, because the actual best temperature varies with things like water quality, altitude and, yes, weather.  Those last two are the same reason why recipes often have special steps or settings for high-altitude prep.  I find that, in North Carolina, the best temperature is on the higher end of that range, from 195 to 200 degrees.</p>

<p>4) Finally, don't stir with a metal spoon during extraction.  Metal is a heat sink and will alter the temperature of the water.  Additionally (this is speculation, as I don't have verification for this), the fact that many coffees are at least mildly acidic can also result in flavor changes with a metal spoon if you stir before adding cream.  The cream is basic and will help neutralize the acid.</p>

<p>OR </p>

<p>2 Espresso Shots + Ice</p>

<p>Settle the score please.</p>
","<p>I'll give some background, a hypothesis, and (more important) instructions to find out experimentally.</p>

<p>The experiment is easy and fun. I did experiments such as paper vs. bamboo filter, slightly different grind sizes, fresh beans vs. 7-weeks off roast, and different coffee:water ratios within the range of a scoop measurement (i.e. is it important to weigh the coffee?).</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong> The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_tasting_tea"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lady tasting tea experiment</a> is at the start of modern statistics and randomized trials. (There's now a book, <a href=""https://smile.amazon.com/Lady-Tasting-Tea-Statistics-Revolutionized-ebook/dp/B00633W4A2/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Lady Tasting Tea: How Statistics Revolutionized Science in the Twentieth Century</a>.) The question was, “Does it matter to add tea to milk vs. milk to tea?” It turns out the answer is yes.</p>

<p><strong>Speculation and Hypothesis:</strong> Adding milk to tea lets significantly more milk get hotter than adding tea to milk does. That could enable more of it to react chemically, e.g. curdling. But that's unlikely with ice, so I'll bet adding ice to hot coffee vs. hot coffee to ice makes no discernable difference in taste. (Let's ignore the fact that dropping ice into hot coffee could splash out more hot coffee than the reverse.)</p>

<p><strong>How to Experiment:</strong> Do a <a href=""http://www.sensorysociety.org/knowledge/sspwiki/pages/triangle%20test.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Triangle Test</a> with 3 or more people. Make the iced coffee both ways, ""A"" and ""B"", keeping all other variables as constant as you can. Each person gets 3 cups, one of which is different than the other two, e.g. a sequence like A-B-A or B-B-A. Give a different random combination to each taster, of course without revealing it.</p>

<p>All tasters should start by tasting their 3 cups in order. Then they can go back and forth between cups as much as they like. Their job is to try to discern the difference and say which of the 3 cups tastes the most different. You might also ask them to state their preference. When they all make their choices, then you can reveal the combinations.</p>

<p><strong>The Math is Not Hard:</strong> If a taster gets it right, we really don't know if they were lucky or good. The default explanation (""null hypothesis"") for the combined test results is that they're within a reasonable range of random results. Dice would randomly get 1/3 of the choices right. If enough people got it right that the odds were <em>small enough</em> of dice getting a result that extreme or better, then we'll conclude the tasters can discern the difference. Different fields of science may use different thresholds. Pick a threshold before doing the experiment. A common standard for ""statistical significance"" is ≤ 5%.</p>

<p>With 3 tasters, if they all get it right, that's a 1/(3<sup>3</sup>) = 1/27 = 3.7% chance, which beats the 5% threshold.</p>

<p>If <em>K</em> of <em>N</em> tasters get it right, the calculation considers the number of ways to get <em>K</em> of <em>N</em> correct choices and the probability of each random choice being correct (1/3).</p>

<p>The Google Sheets formula for Probability{x ≥ K of N correct choices} is:</p>

<pre><code>=1 - BINOMDIST(K - 1, N, 1/3, TRUE)
</code></pre>

<p>so if that value is ≤ 5%, we'll conclude that people can reliably taste the difference.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> To prepare for an experiment, I make paper strips with the different test sequences. Whoever pours for taster <em>n</em> will pick a strip at random, pour those cups while out of view, stash the strip in a pocket, and bring it out after everyone has written down their tasting choices. There needs to be at least enough strips for the number of tasters, and usually a multiple of 6 strips since there are 6 possible sequences. But when there are only 3 tasters, I prune it to 2 sequences that have one A and two B's and 2 sequences that have one B and two A's, so we can't all get the same odd one out.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Each taster gets 3 cups of coffee, a spit cup, water, crackers, and a napkin. I put painter's tape on the coffee cups to mark consistent fill lines and to label them 1, 2, and 3.</p>

","<p>This question is actually answered on the <a href=""https://customerservice.starbucks.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1949"" rel=""nofollow"">website of the coffee producer</a>.</p>

<p>To summarize, the roasting process of coffee produces carbon dioxide inside the beans, which takes a while to find its way out. Sealing the coffee in tight containers would be problematic, as the carbon dioxide would stay in the beans in this way (making the coffee sour) or may let the bag burst over time.</p>

<p>However, not sealing coffee bags is not a solution either, as exposure to air lets the coffee get stale after a while. As supermarket coffee is unfortunately often stored for long period of time before sold, this would be problematic.</p>

<p>So the solution is to either (1) use a one-way valve that allows the carbon dioxide to escape from the bag without the air coming into the bag, or (2) to let the beans degas before sealing them airtight in bags. Solution (1) is probably best for fresh coffee, so it is used here. I don't know what problem is solved with such valves in pet food containers.</p>

When making pour-over coffee, you want to control the water level in the cone to control the brew time and evenly extract coffee.

<p>Related: <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/5/how-important-is-tamping-coffee-for-an-espresso-machine"">How important is tamping coffee for an espresso machine?</a></p>
","<p>There are a pantload of recommendations on tamping, but the one recommendation common to all is... <strong><em>practice!</em></strong> And... The most optimal way of <strong>tamping depends on every individual pull</strong>: the beans (freshness and grind), your skill, machine, etc. at that moment.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the goal (and most important part, in my belief) is to <strong>pack the grounds uniformly.</strong> Any non-uniformity in your puck will allow water to flow more through certain areas than others, giving you non-uniform extraction across your grounds (some over- and some under-extracted). For example, if your tamper isn't level, you'll end up with a ""slanted"" puck; if your grounds are packed <em>more loosely</em> in some places than others... these can yield un-even pucks.</p>

<p>That said, here's a few other common recommendations, some of which you mentioned in the question:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add the grounds uniformly and smooth before tamping. This gives you an even bed of grounds so you can tamp evenly.</li>
<li>15 kg / 30 lb. of pressure. A bath scale could help until one gets this ""by feel"".</li>
<li>Use a heavy tamper. This helps you control all of the other parameters.</li>
<li>Aim for sinking the tamp approximately as far as the bevel (a general rule).</li>
<li>Twisting is not necessary (some do at the end of the compression for ""polishing"", but not necessary).</li>
</ul>

<p>Then there's some controversial bits:</p>

<ul>
<li>""Knocking"" is something I totally don't understand. The idea is to tap the portafilter so as to somehow redistribute the grounds after tamping. I feel like it would just mess up a good puck, but some recommend it either to ensure uniformity of compression of the bottom and top of the puck, or to get grounds off of the side of the portafilter. More discussion at link [4].</li>
<li>On the ""North, South, West, East"" topic: this illustrates tamping at four points around the portafilter. Since the tamp is <em>slightly</em> smaller than the portafilter, the theory is that tamping at points around the sides helps to prevent grounds from creeping up around the tamp (up the side of the portafilter). It seems to me that an appropriate sized tamp will alleviate most of this, but it seems like a reasonable recommendation. Some guides (e.g., below) recommend this, others don't. More at [1].</li>

<p>The aromatic components are the source of the flavor in coffee beans. When you ground them, you crack them fine. The components get free and start to evaporate. That's why you can smell them.

","<p>We have yet to invent a process that removes 100% of the caffeine. When drinking decaf, the important question to consider is how likely you are to feel the effects of the trace amounts of caffeine that are left. That brings us, as most things do, back to the beans.</p>

<p>Arabica has (on average) only <em>half</em> of the caffeine that Robusta contains. Now let's say you have a bag of Robusta where 80% of the beans have 1 - 2% of their original amounts, and 20% of the beans have 15% of their original amounts. Drop by drop, a shot of Robusta is <em>much</em> more likely to keep you awake or elicit other natural responses to caffeine than an identically-sized shot of Arabica.</p>

<p>But let's take that into context and not pick on Robusta so much - the single shot we mentioned might only contain 20mg of caffeine in total, meaning you wouldn't notice the effects any more than you would notice effects from the Arabica. The point is, you <em>could</em>, so if you want to avoid caffeine, go with the milder bean and faster extraction.</p>

<hr>

<p>Most of the data reported in the present review may suggest that espresso brewing can be described as “a quick way to transfer carbon dioxide from roasted and ground coffee to a small cup by means of hot water under pressure”. This then leads to the facts that for espresso coffee, carbon dioxide has to be:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>generated by roasting</p></li>
<li><p>maintained in the bean by proper packaging</p></li>
<li><p>maintained in the ground coffee</p></li>
<li><p>solubilized in water</p></li>
<li><p>released into the beverage.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In this framework statements such as “any error in grinding or in percolation, in temperature or extraction level, has an immediate effect on denounced by the color, the texture and the persistence of the foam” or “the foam is the signature of a well-prepared espresso” can be well justified. In fact, foam volume, persistence, and consistence are the consequences of the carbon dioxide content originally present in the coffee. In addition to the importance of carbon dioxide in espresso coffee foam, we believe that carbon dioxide can play a role even from a taste point of view.</p>

<p>Cons:
Time.  Roasting takes some amount of your time.  It takes far more when you start (I can now roast a pound of coffee in roughly 5 minutes of my time, because the machine does most of the work and I have a system).  Depending on your equipment and learning curve, this can vary widely.  With the equipment I started with and my initial knowledge, a pound of coffee would have taken me a full hour to roast.  </p>

<p>Snobbery.  You will likely get to the point were most other coffee that's commercially produced will be unthinkable to you.  I can't drink coffee at any restaurant without cream (I normally drink it black).  I have a few friends who roast and their coffee is the exception.  But, more or less, home roasting may ruin ""other"" coffee for you.  Along these lines, you may get to the point where you don't enjoy roasting as much anymore, you just want the coffee.  If your time curve is fine, then it works out.  If it's not you might be left with the terrible choice between doing something you don't love or buying less good coffee.</p>

"What are the traits of a well made Cappuccino?","188","","<p>How can you check if a Cappuccino coffee was prepared correctly? What specific traits will a properly prepared Cappuccino display that poorly made Cappuccino's will not?</p>

<p>I've heard that when you it stands still upside down (with perfectly steamed milk and froth is insanely heavenly), then it's perfect. Is that true?</p>
","<p>My take on this is to focus on the mechanics and preparation, which I think is an important part (though perhaps not <em>all</em>) of a cappuccino being properly made.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cappuccino#Preparation"" rel=""nofollow"">cappuccino</a> consists of espresso and steamed milk (see distinction from a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latte"" rel=""nofollow"">latte</a>). The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Barista_Championship"" rel=""nofollow"">World Barista Championship</a> specifies the proper construction in their <a href=""http://www.worldbaristachampionship.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2015-WBC-FINAL.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">beverage definitions (.PDF)</a> in §2.2.2. It consists of a single-shot of espresso (25 mL / ~0.8 fl. oz.), textured (steamed) milk, and <em>at least</em> 1 cm of foam (other places suggest 2 cm). Total volume is 150-180 mL / 5-6 fl. oz.  To the extent that you subscribe to the WBC being a benchmark, the <strong>components</strong>, <strong>volume</strong>, and <strong>amount of foam</strong> define physical properties of a properly made cappuccino. It also states that the components should be in ""harmonious balance.""</p>

<p>The WBC states that aspects of the service are also crucial, such as</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>visual appearance</strong>, such as that the beverage should fill the cup;</li>
<li><strong>served with accoutrements</strong>, such as ""spoon, napkin and unflavoured water"";</li>
<li><strong>logistical aspects</strong> of drinking, such as temperature and holding the cup.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beyond that, there's a lot of variability that might lean closer to personal preference. Some other topics mentioned at WBC and Wikipedia include being ""wet"" (referring to the foam, versus ""dry""), and ""traditional"" (solid central circle of white foam, versus having <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latte_art"" rel=""nofollow"">latte art</a>).</p>

<p>Other recipes for cappuccino at home vary greatly:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.folgerscoffee.com/coffee-how-to/how-to-videos/cappuccino"" rel=""nofollow"">Folgers suggests</a> to use equal parts of coffee (French press or drip), steamed milk, and foam. You'll get a rather different outcome from using coffee instead of espresso.</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.illy.com/wps/wcm/connect/en/coffee/how-prepare-cappuccino"" rel=""nofollow"">illy suggests</a> quantities for a more traditional preparation, using espresso and steamed/foamed milk.</li>
</ul>

"What causes the crema in my latte to appear so charred?","188","","<p>My latest attempt at creating latte art (admittedly theres still room for improvement).  </p>

<p>My question is, what is causing the crema around the milk to have such a charred look to it?  It isn't immediately noticeable after adding the milk but within a minute after it starts developing that charred appearance.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kcmqQ.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kcmqQm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>
","<p>Hard to diagnose just on the back of a photo, but if I had to guess, I'd say the milk is not ""sunk"" properly (i.e. the consistency of your espresso is different to that of the milk). This would also explain why the base of the rosetta is a bit ""murky"". That took me a while to figure out, but I had the same issue (check <a href=""https://instagram.com/p/i3JPUrlnjm/?taken-by=stanimiroff"">this</a> out, then compare to <a href=""https://instagram.com/p/0SNJKLFnuR/?taken-by=stanimiroff"">this</a>). So in practical terms, avoid wiggling the pitcher before a white ""dot"" appears on the surface. Only once the white dot appears on the surface and the stream of milk coming from the pitcher has pushed it further into the cup, should you start rocking the pitcher left to right (good example<a href=""https://instagram.com/p/0Ar4bWgYos/?taken-by=_chris_mg"">here</a> albeit a different pattern).

"Are coffee enhancers bad for you?","185","","<p>I buy Buisman Royal Aroma Coffee enhancer from our local Dutch shop.  It halves the coffee grounds needed and makes the coffee taste stronger.  It is basically burnt sugar, as far as I understand.</p>

<p>Is it bad for you?</p>
","<p>There are two sides to the answer. First, there is the sugar aspect. In moderation, sugar is a critical part of our diet. If you are combining it with two doughnuts and two further teaspoons of sugar in the coffee (for example) then it could potentially lead to the same insulin cycle that causes weight gain in people who eat too much sugar.  The rapid intake of sugar causes your pancreas to flood your blood stream with insulin, which then drops your blood sugar lower than it should go. That causes cravings for more sugar.</p>

<p>The other side is how ""carmelized"" the sugar is. If it goes beyond a certain point, it's possible that the result could be carcinogenic, which is definitely bad.</p>

"What's the difference between iced cafe au lait and iced coffee?","185","","<p>Is iced cafe au lait actually just cafe au lait with ice in it? How can a cafe au lait be iced? I've had both iced cafe au lait and iced coffee at Crazy Mocha and the iced cafe au lait does taste more like cafe au lait than iced coffee. Can someone explain?</p>
","<p>The difference is in the milk.  A Cafe Au Lait is a strong coffee base, with steamed milk.  This is different from a caffe latte in that it is strong coffee, not espresso.</p>

<p>Iced Cafe Au Lait has a variety of recipes from my cursory google search, but all involve some method of milk frothing.  Typically not so much as to actually make foam, but enough to incorporate some air into the milk.  Thus far, I've seen light steaming, adding milk to a french press and essentially churning it to incorporate air etc.  With a cup full of ice, and half full of iced coffee, the frothed milk is added and blended quickly.  I think the trick would be brewing a strong enough coffee that it stands up to both the milk added, as well as the ice melt, but given the coffee is pre-iced, and there is a lot of ice in the cup, and the milk isn't fully heated, it probably brings the temp down with a minimal amount of ice melt.</p>

<p>If you are adding milk to your iced coffee, most likely, it is simply milk being added without going through the added work of frothing it.  This most likely accounts for the difference in flavor.  Another question to ask is if it is the same coffee beans and brewing method for the coffee in each instance.  The cafe may prefer a different roast profile or brewing method for coffee going into their Cafe Au Lait drinks rather than their iced coffee drinks (or a cold brew base.. hrm.. might be interesting!)</p>

"Effect of Sugar on Perceived Bitterness in Coffee","184","","<p>Abstract: Food and Function</p>

<p>Is this effect of sugar in water on coffee solids to be trusted? I like some coffees black (pourover, drip) and some never without sugar (espresso drinks, Aeropress) and sometimes with evaporated milk or cream. I work at a coffee shop as well. Some have said that sugar counteracts bitterness in coffees (I assume due to caffeine). Does this supposed scientific backing have any credibility?</p>
","<p>If you are asking whether the science can be trusted, I would say yes.  The effect is already well known.  You even understand it insomuch as you apparently don't drink more concentrated brews (espresso, aerpresso) without a ""masking"" agent. </p>

<p>All this study is doing is finding a more specific reason for the already acknowledged effect.  People commonly believe that sugar or salt ""masks"" the bitterness from caffeine.  This study is saying that sugar or salt are not just masking the bitterness, but actually changing the chemical properties of the caffeine in solution, thus changing the flavor.</p>

"Is it normal for coffee beans branded ""Seattle Mountain"" to shine?","182","","<p>I bought a bag of Seattle Mountain coffee beans from Costco. Not sure whether it was freshly baked in the store, but I suspect that was the case, since there was a station right beside the coffee section (although I do not really know what that station is for, merely a guess).</p>

<p>The bean is particular shiny. After grinding, it tends to stick together a bit, very loosely though. I have two questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Does the shininess indicate that it is freshly baked? Does it indicate it contains a higher level of some sort of oil?</li>
<li>Since the powder occasionally forms small chunks, does that make the process less efficient when the water running through it? </li>
</ol>
","<p>To start, I would highly doubt the beans were roasted there in store.  Roasting at a commercial level takes large specialized equipment that would be dangerous for average customers to be around (400F+ after all) and create a smell that would easily fill the entire store and be unpleasant to some customers.  </p>

<p>That being said, unless there is a roasting date on the bag, there isn't really a way to tell exactly when the beans were roasted.  </p>

<p>The oils on the outside of a bean can mean many things.  Any given bean will generally become more oily and shinier as it is roasted darker and the oils migrate to the outside of the bean.  This is a process that happens near instantaneously with the roasting process.  However, it also continues much more slowly after the roasting process and beans that have been improperly stored or become stale may become more oily than they were immediately after roasting.  However, some processing methods will also produce beans that become more oily earlier in the roast process.  Dry processed coffee will often start to oil at a much lower roast level that coffee processed by current wet methods.  </p>

<p>The oil does not make the process less efficient by any noticeable measure.  Some of the oil is transferred to the paper filter and some ends up in a cup.  Many people claim to prefer metal mesh filters because more of the oil (and flavor) ends up in the cup.  However, other people claim they can't tell the difference.  The oiliness CAN affect the grinding process if the grinding machine is gravity fed and the beans cling to each other or the container too much.  </p>

<p>TL;DR The oil level or sheen of the coffee can't tell you much unless you know other things about the coffee as well.  It doesn't effect the brew process very much either.</p>

"What skills/techniques are necessary for making espresso?","175","","<p>I'm considering buying an espresso machine, as an experiment. (I have a number of concerns, including expense, counter space, and my spouse's patience, but I also want to move beyond the pre-determined menu items in the coffee shops.) I know it's a complex process with many variables, requiring good technique; I also know that it invites obsession. And I don't need any more obsessions than I already have. I just want to make good coffee and get on with my day. So here's my question: what is the <em>minimum</em> set of skills/techniques/conditions that you need to master in order to produce good espresso?</p>
","<p>If the concern is solely production of great espresso, I would argue that the 'skillset' required actually consists of a single point.</p>

<ul>
<li>Palate. Being able to discern flavours and work out what is good and bad about any shot is essential in being able to improve your espresso.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a skill that you'll need to train and perfect but is the only necessary ability in making good espresso.</p>

<p>The real bulk of what makes espresso great is simply being able to control the factors and variables in making it which requires an ability to taste what is wrong with any given shot. I wouldn't say the specific factors that contribute to good espresso are skills (as skills are traits of the barista), but are simply parameters that is up to you to modify and control.</p>

<p>The parameters you need to keep in mind when making espresso are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Freshness of coffee</li>
<li>Grind size of coffee particle</li>
<li>Water quality and composition</li>
<li>Brew temperature</li>
<li>Brew pressure</li>
<li>Coffee distribution in portafilter</li>
<li>Amount of coffee used per shot</li>
<li>Length of shot/Amount of water pulled/Final output volume</li>
</ul>

<p>Tamp level and pressure are things that affect the shot but aren't exactly variables you would change. These would just be things you would aim to get 'right' every time. 'Right' here means ensuring a level, horizontal bed of coffee and a consistent tamp pressure. Tamp pressure is easier to normalise than it sounds; tamp until the coffee bed stops compressing.</p>

<p>Many of the above will be down to the grinder and espresso machines chosen.</p>

<p>Having a bottomless portafilter enables a clear view of the exit of the shot which serves as an invaluable tool in recognising uneven extractions.</p>

<p>Tips:</p>

<ul>
<li>Never tap/knock the portafilter after tamping. This completely destroys puck uniformity.</li>
<li>Use a distribution tool to help evenly distribute coffee in your portafilter. Use a pin with the Weiss Distribution Technique or a Pullman Chisel/OCD.</li>
<li>VST baskets are replacement baskets for your portafilter with filter holes positioned and sized to aid uniform extractions. Would recommend getting one.</li>
<li>Grind uniformity is also a thing to keep in mind. Higher quality grinders will result in a lower deviation in particle sizes of the resulting coffee grounds. Lower deviation means more consistency in extraction.</li>
<li>Use a scale and a timer to weigh and time your shots. You will need to know what you did in order to know how to improve it.</li>
<li>When chasing a good shot, change one variable in your method at a time. If you change multiple, you will never know what contributed to making your shot great.</li>

"How much ""coffee"" is there in my cup?","174","","<p>Kind of a strange question... </p>

<p>Suppose you brew your coffee to your liking, a v60 filter or an espresso. The ingredients are water and coffee grounds. But how much 'coffee' is there actually in the end cup? That is, if you would be able to extract the water from the cup; what percentage of the original cup of coffee would be left?</p>

<p>Has anyone ever read anything about this?</p>

<p>What I'm trying to get at is; the <em>strength</em> of a cup of coffee. Everyone uses the saying <em>a strong cup of coffee</em> when they quite often refer to the roasting. This could also be a reference to how diluted coffee is; e.g. an americano. But what percentage of that americano would then be 'real coffee'. </p>
","<p>This is discussed in many different contexts many times, I assume. So, I can say not a very strange question in essence.</p>

<p>I advise you to check a previous answer first. It includes a very nice chart and the ideal point for quality brewing of coffee. Also, it shows the extraction ratios, a hint of TDS (total dissolved solids) etc. I copy its link just below:</p>

</ul>

<p>As you see, if you can manage to brew an ideal coffee, you can extract only around 20% of the valuable ""essence"" from the core of the beans. That's the reason why some of the members of <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/"">Coffee SE</a> tries to re-brew the used grounds for a second time (I assume), as you can follow below:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1749/brewing-with-the-coffee-grounds-twice"">Brewing with the coffee grounds twice?</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Then, of course, some other members discuss the TDS part to find the golden brewing point at the first chart. The easiest way to follow that point repeatedly is done by a refractometer. It is a device that can measure opaqueness. So, by measuring the opaqueness of your brew, you may reason on the amount of dissolved coffee ""essence"" in the water; therefore you may estimate the strength of your cup.</p>

<p>The funnel on my moka pot has a ""crimp"" -- a little ring-shaped indentation -- around the middle, similar to this one from Bialetti:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BlhFe.png"" alt=""moka pot funnel with arrow pointing to crimp""></p>

<p><strong>What is the purpose of this crimp?</strong></p>

<p>It is indented toward the middle of the funnel (i.e., not protruding out of the funnel). It's far too low to indicate recommended ""fill line"" for quantity of grounds (for my taste anyway!) There's no other attachment that fits into it, nor does it engage with any other part on the pot (e.g., the top lip of the funnel sits on the moka pot base). It's one piece of sheet metal; e.g., this isn't a point where two pieces attach. Some moka pots have funnels that have this crimp, and others are solid/flat around the side.</p>
","<p>The crimp is there to support the <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/2026/127"">reducer</a>! The reducer slots into the funnel, and sits on the ridge. You then put coffee on top of it, allowing you to use less coffee in larger pots.</p>

"Do I need higher pressure to create a ristretto?","170","","<p>I want to make a ristretto. Besides grinding my coffee finer, do I need to increase the pressure of the steam, or should I leave it the same?</p>
","<p>Typically, a ristretto is an espresso shot pulled with half as much water. If you assume a normal shot is 30ml, the only practical difference in pulling a ristretto is to stop the extraction at 15ml. </p>

<p>The coffee grind, quantity and pull pressure should remain the same.</p>

<p>Regardless, if you feel as if the shot is taking too long, or coming out too fast, you could try adjusting the grind before adjusting the pressure, which should be trickier.</p>

"Good quality espresso / cappuccino maker that doesn't leak or break within 18 months of use","167","","<p>I have been buying de Longhi coffee machines for a while now and they seem to be getting worse.  I started on a Delonghi EC152 which was low cost and pretty reliable.  Then when my 2nd one died, I tried to order a replacement but it had been discontinued and so equivalent model was a EC146.B which was really poor.  As luck would have it, or so I thought, I received another de Longhi as a present, an EC 270.  But this leaks like crazy after only a few weeks.  If you fiddle with the valve on the  water vessel it stops leaking for a few  hours.</p>

"Is it necessary to sort beans after roasting?","167","","<p>After roasting, the beans colour is usually uneven. Most of the beans have the desired roast, but some are burnt, and some have visibly lighter colours.</p>

<p>Some people sort every single bean after every roast. It is impressive work and result, but also tedious. I believe that is necessary for the look of the beans in a retail shop. Some other people sort just a little to remove really <em>bad</em> beans (i.e. burnt).</p>

<p>What are criteria / conditions to sort beans?</p>

<p>I wonder about taste: A tiny number of beans with different roast should not impact it, but I lack experience to know.</p>
","<p>Sorting done during the processing phase of coffee production (prior to roasting) is done in many places and can produce <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/264/peaberry-and-coffee-varieties"">lots of coffee that look very different, but taste almost exactly the same.</a>  Peaberry beans may be sorted out (mostly by sight from what I understand) and sold as separate lots.  Additionally size may be used and beans can be sorted with screens (slightly more automated) to produce lots that appear more consistent in size.  While these things may affect appearance, they are not thought to affect taste (by most) and so all of these will likely be sold.  However, during these same processes, any truly ""bad"" beans (moldy, unformed, etc) will probably be removed and discarded.  If buyers see significant amounts of bad beans in a lot, it will be assumed that care was not taken in the processing of the coffee.</p>

<p>I roast at home and the only time I have ever ""sorted"" is if a bean or two from a previous batch was hidden in my drum and gets BBB'd (burnt beyond belief) in a second roasting process.  Depending on roasting process, there is always a range of time that the beans get to certain points, they don't all hit first crack or second crack at the same time.  If the beans are of sufficient quality and properly sorted after processing (at the source/origin) those ranges will be fairly narrow with not a lot of overlap.  The machine I have now does a fairly good job or mixing the beans during roasting and the roasts I get from it are quite consistent.  If I roast at a lower temperature longer, usually even more so.</p>

<p>To answer your question, the higher the quality of green beans and the better the roast technique, the less the need for sorting (if any).  I can hardly see any reason for sorting beans for size/shape after the roasting process.  Roasted coffee should be stored in opaque packaging, and any efforts to unify appearance would be nullified by proper storage.  If there is so much variation in the roast that it needs sorting for flavor, I would suggest that time might be better spent refining the roasting process for consistency.</p>

"Is there a method to make flavored coffee without syrups?","166","","<p>As far as I've seen, flavored coffee is created by putting the beans in a tumbler with the desired syrup flavor.</p>

<p>Is there a method to create flavored coffee without using syrups or other sweeteners?</p>
","<p>I believe there are several ways to make flavoured coffees without syrup or sweetener.</p>

<p>For example, I make vanilla coffee by mixing fresh vanilla seeds with finely ground medium-roast coffee, and seal the mixture for some time (duration depends on the weather). The result is quite nice, with a slight touch of vanilla. This is <em>not</em> a product---just for personal use and still exploring. The difference with syrup or essence or flavouring is that the touch feels lighter and more natural.</p>

<hr>

<p>A basic mechanism here is to mix ground coffee with some spice, and let the mixture sleep for flavour to spread.</p>

<p>Another mechanism is to put some spice directly in a container with roasted beans. This seems more appropriate for spices like cinnamon (no need to extract seeds like for vanilla).</p>

<p>I have not tried to mix spices with <em>green</em> beans, as the roasting stage changes a lot of things, but that should be an interesting path.</p>

"Amount of money I should spend on a Grinder","162","","<p>I currently have a Chemex, a Aeropress and a bialetti espresso Machine(electric espresso machine, bad quality). I use mostly the aeropress and the Chemex.</p>

<p>My grinder is a Hario manual grinder. I want to get an electric one.
How much should I spend, minimum, on a electric grinder so I can get a good grind for my brewing methods?</p>
","<p>Depends on if you want to be able to grind true espresso grinds.  My daily grinder I received as a wedding present and it suits me just fine, a Cuisinart for about $40 dollars.  If I want to grind for espresso, this is completely incapable of doing so, so I ended up getting a $180 dollar unit that is capable of timed grinding and grinding to espresso level grind.  This unit is a Breville with a cone burr, which I honestly really like because it doesn't have the static of the Cuisinart.</p>

<p>This is very much a personal choice type of question.  If you have $10000 burning a hole in your pocket, I'm sure you could find a grinder to match, or if you are worried about keeping the lights on, you could probably find one to suit your needs as well.</p>

<p>Here are a few recommendations..</p>

<p><strong>Low End:</strong>
Cuisinart DBM-8 -- Does good coarse grind, to a reasonably fine grind.  Drip brewers and pour over are right in the middle of its standard grind range.  Biggest con is it is a flat disc grinder and generates quite a bit of static so be aware that it will make a bit of a mess.  Cannot grind espresso.</p>

<p><strong>Mid Range (150-250)</strong> -- The Baratza Encore is really popular and a pretty good price.  It has conical burrs and gearing specifically intended to reduce static and heat.  I personally use a Breville Dose Control Pro which is about the least expensive grinder I could find with the portafilter holder and timed grinding.  Thus far I've been happy with it, low static, very very fine grind level for espresso if needed, but I am seeing some reviews about how the internal components tend to fail after extended use.  Someone may be able to comment on the feasibility of the Encore for espresso grind better than I.  Breville can grind espresso, someone please comment on Encore / Virtuoso espresso grind capability!</p>

<p><strong>High Range</strong> --  The sky is the limit here.  You could go with a higher end Baratza going all the way to the 1000 dollar range and probably higher, if you've got that $10,000 dollars burning a hole in your pocket you could go big with a 60 lb EK43 (and then send me a big tip!).. just kidding.  The EK43 runs about 2500 and is a shop grinder, although it is now a barista favorite for competition.  When you start getting into the super high end machines, personally my favorite is Mahlkonig but really.. there's no reason for this caliber of grinder at home.  </p>

<p>Again, how much to spend is a tricky question.  I would say a minimum of $40 and a max of however much you want to spend.  If you have the money, and want a solid reliable workhorse, I would probably go with either the Baratza Encore or Baratza Virtuoso.  Baratza is one of the higher quality, and popular home grinders that don't completely break the bank.</p>

"Do I need to boil the water before using my moka?","162","","<p>I was recently told that I could improve the flavour of my moka pot coffee by boiling the water separately before putting it in the pot and assembling it. </p>

<p>The theory goes that this means that the pot spends less time on the stove, meaning the grounds are less likely to be burned from the heat of the pot before the water has a chance to turn into steam and brew the coffee.</p>

<p>Is this true?</p>
","<p>It is true. </p>

<p>Preboiling the water will make the coffee tastes a lot better. It will reduce the bitterness and give space for a lot of other notes.</p>

<p>Heating up the Mokka too much releases also metallic taste from the machine itself and you boil the coffee.</p>

"What are the different varieties of coffee- understanding the nearest coffee shop menu?","161","","<p>I am unaware of the different varieties of coffee. I have heard names like latte, expresso, etc. but do not know the differences between those and what are some other varieties. Since this is a stackexchange on the very topic, some details would be welcome.</p>
","<p>There are many, many, many types. In order to give a good overview, some background knowledge is useful. What all types of coffee have in common is that all are produced from the pits of coffee cherries, the fruits borne by trees in the genus coffea (coffee beans are technically seeds of these trees, not beans). Coffee cherries are harvested from coffee trees, the pits are removed and processed, producing green coffee beans. These are then roasted, ground, and brewed. </p>

<p>Coffee can vary on any of the following factors:</p>

<p><strong>Bean Variety -</strong> There are two major bean varieties of coffee: arabica and robusta. Arabica coffees are more ubiquitous and generally regarded as superior in quality to robusta coffees. If you are buying coffee from a coffee shop, ordering it at a restaurant, or brewing it at home, there is a very good chance you are drinking an arabica variety. Robusta is easier to grow and a less temperamental crop than arabica, contains quite a bit more caffeine, and generally is poorer quality than arabica. Robusta varieties are often used in instant coffee.</p>

<p><strong>Processing Method -</strong> There are two major processing types for green coffee beans: washed and unwashed. Washed coffees remove the cherry before the bean is left to dry, while unwashed coffees have their beans removed from the cherries after drying. Unwashed coffees often come from Africa and Indonesia and have richer, earthier flavors, while washed coffees often come from Latin America, and are smoother and fruitier.</p>

<p><strong>Geographic Origin -</strong> One of the most important factors, as coffee flavors vary greatly with geography, climate, and soil composition. For example, Ethopian coffees tend to be rich, full-bodied, and wine-like, Hawaiian coffees like Kona tend to be more acidic (flavor term, not pH), and Latin American coffees tend to be more medium bodied, fruity, and floral.
Roast - Roasting is a complex process that can produce varying degrees of flavor and caffeine content. Roasts levels can include light/half-city, medium/full-city, full (Viennese/Italian), and double (French), in order of increasing boldness. Contrary to popular opinion, lighter roasts tend to have more caffeine than darker roasts. A good illustration of the process can be found here: <a href=""http://www.sweetmarias.com/roast"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.sweetmarias.com/roast</a>...</p>

<p><strong>Brewing method -</strong> Can include drip filter, french press, percolated, espresso, or other methods. Brewing method also makes a big difference, with coffee aficionados generally preferring french press and espresso.</p>

<p>The most expensive type of coffee is Kopi Luwak from Sumatra, Bali, Java, and Sulawesi. Kopi Luwak roughly translates to ""civet coffee"" in English, and is called such because the beans are harvested from the droppings of civets (a cat-like mammal from Indonesia). The beans are supposedly of superior quality because the civets choose only the ripest coffee beans to eat from coffee trees, and are processed in a unique way by the civets digestive tract. Kopi Luwak often sells for around $300/lb.</p>

<p>The following are the different types of coffee drinks that you may find in a cafe that prepares coffee using the espresso coffee making method:</p>

<p><strong>Affogato-</strong> This is a term that literally means 'drowned'. It is the description of a shot of separately served espresso that is later poured over a the top of a scoop of vanilla ice cream or gelato. This beverage is usually served in a short drink glass and is a Italian desert favourite. Popular Affogatos include Vanilla Affogato, Mocha Affogato, and Peppermint Affogato.</p>

<p><strong>Americano-</strong> Also known as ""Lungo"" or ""Long Black"" and made by diluting 1-2 shots of espresso with hot water in order to approximate the texture, flavor and body of an American-style drip coffee. Said to have been originally devised as a sort of insult to Americans who wanted their Italian espresso diluted.</p>

<p><strong>Babycino-</strong> A cappuccino styled drink served in an up-market café typically for children. It consists of warm milk in a small cup and topped with milk froth and chocolate powder. No espresso coffee essence is added.
Breve: A term in Italian that means short and is used to describe an espresso coffee drink made with a half-and-half light cream or semi-skim milk instead of full fat milk</p>

<p><strong>Caffe' Freddo-</strong> Chilled, sweetened espresso served in a tall glass, often on ice.</p>

<p><strong>Caffe Latte or “Latte”-</strong> A ‘premium milk coffee experience’. Freshly steamed milk without foam served in a tall glass with a shot of espresso coffee.
Caffe Mocha: A combination of chocolate syrup and a shot of espresso, topped with steamed milk and a layer of micro-foam. Finished with a sprinkled of chocolate.</p>

<p><strong>Cappuccino Chiaro-</strong> (AKA Wet or Light cappuccino): Cappuccino prepared with more milk than usual.</p>

<p><strong>Cappuccino Scuro-</strong> (AKA Dry or Dark cappuccino) Cappuccino prepared with less milk than usual.</p>

<p><strong>Cappuccino: “Cap”-</strong>  A ‘traditional morning heart starter’. Steamed foamed velvety milk poured over one shot (1) of coffee oil extract made from 12gm of freshly ground beans producing 38ml of essence. Finished by topping with foam and a sprinkle of chocolate powder. Served in a pre heated vitrified ceramic cup.</p>

<p><strong>Con panna-</strong> Like the beverage ""macchiato"", but whipped cream is substituted for steamed milk.</p>

<p><strong>Cortado-</strong> means ""cut"" in Spanish so the double shot espresso served in a demetesse glass supported with a metal handle is ""cut"" with an equal part of hot milk, making it in between the size and strength of a macchiato and a cappuccino. It is popular in Spain and Portugal, as well as throughout Latin America and Cuba, where it is drunk in the afternoon. Variations include more froth on top than a traditional cortado and occasionally with different names such as Piccolo or Gibraltar. Thanks to Ryan Cerbus for the entry.</p>

<p><strong>Corretto-</strong> Espresso ""corrected"" with a touch of grappa, cognac, sambuca, or other spirit.</p>

<p><strong>Doppio-</strong> Italian term for double. Double Espresso or twice the amount of coffee and twice the amount of water. Basically it describes two shots of espresso in one demitasse container.</p>

<p><strong>Espresso con Panna-</strong> A variation of the macchiato by substituting a dollop of whipped cream for the milk froth. Basically a Starbucks invention. Means in Italian ""espresso with cream”.</p>

<p><strong>Espresso Lungo-</strong> American term where a shot is extracted longer for a bit of extra espresso. Tends to maximizes the caffeine but will mostly produce a more bitter cup.</p>

<p><strong>Espresso Romano-</strong> Espresso served with a lemon peel on the side. Whilst not a typical accompaniment in Italy it is commonly served with the espresso beverage in America.</p>

<p><strong>Flat White-</strong> “White Coffee” - ‘uncompromising taste’.Steamed microfroam milk poured through and under the espresso crème produced from one shot (1) of coffee extract made on 12gm of freshly ground coffee producing 38ml of essence. Served in a pre heated vitrified ceramic cup. A common espresso coffee order in Australia/New Zealand. Great for latte art!</p>

<p><strong>Hammerhead-</strong> A coffee drink only served in the USA. It is an American term for a shot of espresso in a coffee cup that is topped up with drip-filtered coffee. As Kris Rosvold explains in the comments: In Oregon, the hammerhead is usually known as a red eye and uses 2 shots of espresso topped up in a 16oz travel mug with drip coffee. It's also sometimes called a ""shot in the dark"".</p>

<p><strong>Irish Coffee-</strong> Coffee mixed with a dash of Irish whiskey and served with cream on top.</p>

<p><strong>Latte Macchiato-</strong> Steamed milk served in a tall glass rather than a cup that is “stained” by a shot of espresso coffee.</p>

<p><strong>Long Black-</strong> Often called the “American”. It is the ‘benchmark coffee without milk’. It is pure coffee made from one &amp; one half shots of coffee extract made on 16gm of fresh ground beans producing 50ml of essence blended with steamed water. Served in a pre heated vitrified ceramic cup with the essence floated over the top of a cup filled with hot/boiling water. It is a standard espresso (Short Black) but lengthened by the addition of hot/boiling water.</p>

<p><strong>Lungo-</strong> An espresso made by purposely allowing more water to flow through the ground coffee than usual. (sometimes called an Americano or ‘long’).</p>

<p><strong>Macchiato-</strong> Meaning “stained” - Described as ‘strong, marked or stained’. A touch of steamed foamed milk added to a double shot of coffee extract made from 24gm of fresh ground beans producing 75ml of essence. Served in glass.</p>

<p><strong>Mazagran-</strong> A French drink composed of cold coffee and seltzer water. First created by the French soldiers in 1840 in the town of Argelia. A variation includes iced coffee made with maraschino.</p>

<p><strong>Quad-</strong> An espresso drink made with four shots of coffee.</p>

<p><strong>Ristretto-</strong> (Ristretto in Italian means ""restricted, shrunk or short”) It is the richest and most concentrated espresso drink where less water but the same amount of coffee is used to make the beverage and creates a less bitter espresso. The extraction time is shortened producing as little as 3 oz of liquid per serving. Pure and intense espresso served in a demitasse cup.
Short Black: A ‘pure intense Italian favourite with a biting crème head. Contains 75ml of pure double shot (2) coffee essence made from 24gm of fresh ground coffee beans. Traditionally served in glass and is referred to as Espresso by European customers.</p>

<p><strong>Viennese Coffee-</strong> Brewed black coffee of any roast or origin topped and served with whipped cream.</p>

"What are coffee flavorings found around the globe?","159","","<p>Recently I learned that in some Middle Eastern countries they add cardamom and cloves to their coffee to flavor it.</p>

<p><strong>Are there any other coffee flavorings found around the globe I might not have heard of?</strong></p>
","<p>I prefer my coffee flavored just with water. However, it is common for people to flavor their coffee with many other ingredients with respect to their personal preference. As personal preference is closely related to culture, <strong>yes, you may enlist some location-based flavoring ingredients for coffee</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>In Turkey</strong>, generally, coffee does not have any ingredients except sugar. In the west part, mastic is sometimes added for flavor. This is a common tradition with Greeks, I assume. In the Southeast part, cardamom is rarely added. This is a common tradition with Syrians, I assume. I never heard of cloves around here.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Sugar</strong> and its close relatives: I think this is the most common one, independent from the geography.</p>

<p><strong>Milk</strong> may be the second most common one. Mostly used in the Italian-influenced Western coffee.</p>

<p><strong>Chocolate</strong> is only common in the Austrian-influenced coffee recipes, I assume.</p>

<p><em>From now on, I think we may say not very common flavorings.</em></p>

<p><strong>Cinnamon</strong> is common both on Austrian-influenced coffees and old-style coffees.</p>

<p><strong>Mastic</strong> is common around Aegean Sea with Turkish brewing method.</p>

<p><strong>Cardamom</strong> is common around Syria with Turkish brewing method.</p>

<p><strong>Cloves</strong> is common around Arabian Peninsula with Saudi brewing method (say, a brewing method close to Turkish).</p>

<p><strong>Chicory</strong> is common in Vietnam, South India and in New Orleans/Southern Louisiana of USA.</p>

"What was the cause for the current overwhelming popularity in the brighter, more acidic coffees?","158","","<p>Almost every coffee shop I go to serves up quite acidic and bright coffees. It seems that this is where modern coffee is and is not necessarily a bizarre phenomenon in itself but in particular the world of espresso it has veered quite far away from the traditional Italian style.</p>

<p>In fact it seems we've veered so far towards acidity and people have actually called the Italian style of espresso as 'over-roasted' which I believe to be untrue. I do enjoy a somewhat more acidic coffee when I am searching for a fruitier cup but I do not understand the current stigma against even the slightest darker roast.</p>

<p>So what caused this tip in the scales that prompted the surge in popularity in brighter and more acidic coffees and seeing even the slightest darker roast as being over-roasted?</p>
","<p>I think there are a number of factors influencing the current situation.</p>

<ul>
<li>The rise of micro/small and home roasters.  This allows people access to fresher coffee.  The acidic and bright notes in coffees tend to fade quicker than roast notes.  Meaning these bright notes are more readily available to the consumer.</li>
<li>Changes in coffee processing.  Different process methods favor different flavor profiles.  Dry Process (the oldest) favors less bright and more bodied flavors.  Newer processing methods enhance bright flavor profiles.</li>
<li>The rise and market dominance of large chain roasters.  These companies tend to roast dark because it is easier to hit a consistent flavor profile which lasts longer (important for shipping), but it sacrifices the origin flavors which are varied greatly and available.  They have given dark roasts a more McDonald's character among consumers (consistent, but not high quality). </li>
</ul>

<p>This is not to say that dark roasts are bad.  But they have partially been given a bad rep by large chains who are using them to maximize profit, and not flavor.  Home and microroasters now also have unprecedented access to a HUGE variety of beans that years back would have been out of reach.  This means that companies can cheaply distribute very high quality beans with extraordinary flavor profiles when roasted at a lighter level.  </p>

"Why did espresso never catch on as a mainstream drink in the US?","155","","<p>I live in the US. During a recent trip to France, I was struck by the fact that espresso is the default coffee configuration there (i.e., if you order ""coffee"" in a restaurant without specifying further, espresso is what you get). And Nespresso-compatible coffee pods are sold in the supermarket for use in Nespresso-compatible machines, whereas in the US Nespresso hasn't licensed their system to any third parties, so it's still a specialty item. Presumably the same situation prevails in Italy, where espresso originally comes from. </p>

<p>In the US, meanwhile, you can get ""espresso drinks,"" but that usually means espresso diluted in a large quantity of milk and syrup. Espresso per se is an esoteric beverage consumed mostly by a small number of enthusiasts.</p>

<p>Part of what motivates this question is that in some ways espresso seems tailor-made for the American market:</p>

<ul>
<li>Invented out of a desire for fast service</li>
<li>Involves large, complex machinery</li>
<li>Lends itself to quick consumption</li>
</ul>

<p>And yet here we are. So the question is: <strong>are there specific factors, beyond ""different countries do things differently,"" that kept espresso from catching on in the US?</strong></p>
","<p>Drip coffee is the mainstream coffee drink in America because of the popularity of the drip brand Nescafe introduced in 1938, the large scale fight for market share, wide promotion and advertising created a huge market for brewed and specifically instant coffee.</p>

<p>Add to that that GI's acquired a taste for coffee after experiencing it in wartime rations and the surging popularity of American supermarkets having myriad instant coffee brands. The wide scale and aggressive marketing of instant coffee was a much more American than European phenomena. </p>

<p>Europe was less inundated by this marketing deluge and had a longer history of coffee shops.

","<h2>tl;dr: Not sure yet, but it looks promising</h2>

<hr>

<p>So there are a <a href=""https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=coffee+alzheimers&amp;btnG=&amp;as_sdt=1%2C5&amp;as_sdtp="" rel=""nofollow"">whole bunch</a> of studies that have been done that have investigated a potential link between coffee consumption and Alzheimers.</p>

<p>The problem, as always, is that these types of '<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"" rel=""nofollow"">cohort studies</a>' are really difficult. Basically the way it works is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Get a load of volunteers</li>
<li>By doing questionnaires, work out everything about them</li>
<li>Track them over a long period of time</li>
<li>See if there's a statistically significant link between combinations of behaviours (such as drinking coffee) and a particular outcome (diagnosis of Alzheimers) </li>
</ul>

<p>All the standard stuff applies here: you are not testing for <em>causation</em>, only for <em>correlation</em>. For example, ~80% of Americans drink coffee, but in other cultures this number varies a lot. If the coffee drinkers in your study are predominantly American, and the non-coffee drinkers are predominantly not, you have a whole bunch of confounding factors. Designing your study to avoid this kind of situation is really hard, especially when you're relying on volunteers.</p>

<p>There's also the issue of what exactly are you measuring? Someone might drink 3 cups a day now, but only has done for the past few years. Another person might drink 2 cups a day, but has done their whole life. Another person might drink 2 cups of decaff a day. Questionnaires are usually not sophisticated enough to capture this level of detail (partly because in your big expensive study you want to capture as much information about different behaviours as possible - not just coffee consumption).</p>

<p>Remember also that medical studies are <em>chronically</em> badly reported in the mainstream press. Even in 'high-brow' publications, by the time the headline-writers get their hands on a study, the message can have changed <em>wildly</em>. It's always worth trying to dig up the actual paper whenever new research is mentioned in the news. If no paper is linked, just ignore the headline.</p>

<p>One tool against all of this uncertainty is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_analysis"" rel=""nofollow"">meta-analysis</a>. This is where you look at every single study, weighted by how confident you are in the data (e.g. by weighting more to studies with more participants, and better questionnaires etc.). You then do some careful statistics work to get a measure of confidence across all of the studies. Think of it as a sophisticated way of 'averaging them out'.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.maneyonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/174313206X152546"" rel=""nofollow"">One of these was done</a> in 2002. Only 4 studies had been done by then, but the conclusion was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although our pooled estimates show that coffee consumption is inversely associated with the risk of AD, the four studies had heterogeneous methodologies and results. Further prospective studies evaluating the association between coffee consumption and AD are strongly needed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Heterogeneous is science for 'different')</p>

"Roasting my coffee beans","154","","<p>I just read online that some people roast their coffee bean before they grind the bean, to adjust the flavor. This sounds really interesting, and I would like to try. I would like to do this properly, and I am wondering about couple of things:</p>

<ol>
<li>What temperature to use, and for how long? I would imagine that this is determined by the current roast of the coffee and the target roast I would like, is there any kind of lookup table as a guidance?</li>
<li>Some people mentioned cooling and de-gas after roast. What does that mean? I understand the cooling part, but what kind of process is de-gas - I guess it is some process happening on its own as the bean is cooled, but I am curious what exactly it is.</li>
</ol>
","<p>Your first question isn't clear exactly.  All <strong>drinkable coffee</strong> has been roasted first, as raw coffee beans are not edible. I've read that re-roasting beans isn't practical for some reason that I'm not clear on, but I agree with Peter Pei Guo's, comment about why you would want to re-roast coffee in the first place.  </p>

<p>Immediately after roasting, coffee beans produce carbon dioxide gas as a result of the chemical changes happening inside the bean.  This gas takes some time to be released from the interior of the bean, anywhere <strong>from 3-5 days</strong>.  </p>

<p>I've brewed my own home roasted coffee immediately after roasting to see if this is really true, and yes, it is.  </p>

<p>Immediately after roasting the coffee has a really harsh, sour taste from the acidity that accompanies carbon dioxide gas (carbolic acid).  It also foamed (bloomed) really violently with the addition of hot water.  After resting the roasted coffee for about <strong>5 days</strong>, the coffee from the same batch of beans <strong>tasted great</strong>. </p>

<p>One of <strong>the indicators</strong> of freshly roasted coffee beans is <strong>the bloom</strong> that they produce as some residual carbon dioxide gas is released with <strong>the addition of hot water</strong>.  </p>

<p>As <em>time passes</em> and the beans begin to stale a bit, the <em>bloom lessens</em>, then <strong>disappears</strong>.  After properly resting freshly roasted coffee however, <strong>the small amount of residual carbon dioxide doesn't affect the taste</strong>.  Immediately <em>after roasting</em> however, the <em>carbon dioxide</em> levels are <strong>too high</strong> to allow good tasting coffee when brewed.  </p>

"Can flavoured coffees alter the shelf life of the coffee?","151","","<p>Flavouring a coffee involves introducing flavour oils to the beans after roasting. </p>

<p>I am assuming that the shelf life of an object is measured as the minimum shelf life of its components, so is it possible for these flavour oils to reduce the longevity of the roasted bean, or do flavour oils have as long, if not longer shelf lives?</p>

<p>By shelf life, I mean the length of time before it is unsafe for consumption. Whether the flavour of flavoured coffee degrades at a different rate to unflavoured coffee is most likely a whole new question entirely.</p>
","<p>You are quite right - the flavouring does indeed change the shelf life in a certain way. It is necessary to look at this from two perspectives.</p>

<h2><strong>Shelf Life by Safe Consumption:</strong></h2>

<p>The flavouring compounds used to flavour coffees last longer without degrading. This means that they <strong>ARE NOT</strong> the limiting factor when it comes to the shelf life of a coffee. <strong>Therefore, shelf life is not changed by flavouring the coffee as these compounds degrade (or go bad) after the coffee itself.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>Shelf Life by Taste:</strong></h2>

<p>Because the coffee has been treated with flavouring compounds, it will hide certain aspects of degradation of the coffee due to aging, decaffeination, and oxidation. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In addition, these flavors help extend the shelf life of coffee by
  disguising changes in flavor due to decaffeination, oxidation, or
  aging processes.</p>
  
  <p>Source: <a href=""http://www.madehow.com/Volume-3/Flavored-Coffee-Bean.html"">How Products are Made</a></p>

<p><strong>Therefore, shelf life by taste is changed, as the flavouring compounds mask the degradation and therefore the bad tastes of the aging coffee.</strong></p>

"Peaberry and coffee varieties","150","","<p>The peaberry coffee from Tanzania is <a href=""http://www.coffeereview.com/the-tanzanian-peaberry-mystery/"">well-known in the US</a>, though perhaps partly due to marketing forces here, the corresponding flattened beans are not easy to come by.</p>

<p>Are there other varieties/regional coffees that feature a peaberry collection?  I'd be interested in trying some of these, esp. if one can compare the peaberry taste to that of the normal ""twin"" beans.</p>
","<p>My findings are that it's actually exactly the same.  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaberry"">Peaberry beans</a> occur in almost all coffee in some percentage.  They aren't grown separate, they are the exact same coffee that's been sorted out of the processed beans so that the lot looks more homogeneous and sells better.  I've actually been lucky enough to at one time have peaberry, oversized and ""regular"" beans all from the same lot.  The coffees all tasted exactly the same to me.  I have a friend that claimed he tasted some difference in in the larger beans, owing perhaps to not having been roasted as thoroughly.  </p>

<p>The beans I had were Sumatran Toba Batak, sold in sorted lots of 17+, peaberry and regular.  I am sure that almost any processing station you went to in the world could do such processing if they chose, although it's probably labor intensive and would add some cost to the beans.  If Tanzania is doing it regularly, they have probably found it's financially worth it.  On occasion when I look closely at the beans I am roasting, I'll usually find a few peaberries in the mix.</p>

"Extending the Japanese Brewing Method to Espresso","149","","<p>I've heard about the ""Japanese Brewing Method"" that's been getting some exposure. I usually brew with an espresso machine, and I was wondering if the same logic applies here. Does adding ice to a cup, so the espresso hits the ice immediately, give a similar effect to the Japanese Brewing Method?</p>
","<p>The Japanese or Kyoto Method  and espresso a extremely dissimilar in their extraction methods and flavor profiles. It is truly like comparing apples and oranges.</p>

<p>Espresso utilizes pressure as its main component whereas the Japanese method uses time as its main control.
Espresso is concentrated more robust in its taste profile while the Japanese method is ""more delicate with a lighter body"".</p>

"How long can I store ground coffee in the fridge?","148","","<p>I ground some coffee beans this morning, but I'm not a major coffee drinker, how fast can I expect its flavour to degrade, and at what point would it become completely undrinkable?</p>
","<p><strong>Coffee should never be stored in the fridge!</strong></p>

<p>In the same way that <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_bicarbonate#Applications"">baking soda</a> absorbs smells, coffee will absorb smells and flavors in your refrigerator. These compounds can be extracted when you brew your coffee and will contribute to undesired flavors.</p>

<p>Proper storage of coffee is to put your beans into an airtight container, and store around 25C out of sunlight (EX: your cabinet). </p>

"Is it okay to compost used grounds?","148","","<p>Given that coffee evolved caffeine as a way of poisoning predators, are (caffeinated) used grounds suitable for composting? Apparently caffeine deters some bacteria and funghi which could affect the way it breaks down into compost?</p>
","<p>As an avid composter I can say that I have always used lots of coffee grounds and my compost has always done well with it. There are a few reasons why it is beneficial:</p>

<ul>
<li>used grounds are fairly pH neutral. If your compost is too acidic they even help a little by absorbing extra acid. Unused grounds however would add to acidity.</li>
<li>coffee grounds are considered ""green material"" in compost lingo which is usually what compost piles need more of, as opposed to brown material that is fairly abundant in average land plots (maybe not for apartment composters).</li>
<li>coffee grounds attract worms, so even if some bacteria are harmed the worms are compost rock-stars and they make up for it</li>
</ul>

<p>A good rule of thumb with composting is everything in moderation, so there is such thing as too much used coffee in the pile. When I empty my indoor compost bin into the outside bin coffee is generally 10-25% of that green material. If it is more than 50% you probably need to reduce the amount to compost or find more green material sources.</p>

"Can I have this type of coffee?","144","","<p>I would like to know if people normally have the type of coffee I do. I take coffee from a vending machine that has a variety of options (latte, cappuccino, espresso) of which I choose espresso. This vends 60ml of espresso (people local to me call it 60ml of decoction). This looks dark brown in color. I usually have this as such but would sometimes add 200ml of hot water to this. I never add sugar or milk to this as I hate the sweetness it adds to my coffee. What is the name of the beverage that I'm having ? Is it recommended to have 60ml of espresso (without water, milk or sugar) twice a day ? Will this have large amounts of caffeine and is it going to have an adverse effect on my health ?</p>

"Home roaster cleaning and/or seasoning","142","","<p>I have a Gene Cafe that I have been using at home for some time.  On inital reading of the directions, it recommends washing the roasting chamber:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oils and residual debris remaining from the roasting process will
  build up and adversely affect the taste of future batches. Clean the
  chamber using a dish washing brush, sponge and dish washing liquid.
  Dry the chamber completely before storing it away.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, I know that there is a lot of juju surrounding the seasoning of commercial roasters.  I've wiped the inside out on a couple of occasions with a cloth when I've accidently over roasted and ended up with  a lot of oil in there.  If I leave a lot of oil in the chamber, it seems to shorten the end roast times of future batches (they move through the later stages of roasting too quickly to be well controlled).</p>

<p>So basically, to clean, or not to clean?  </p>
","<p>The roasting chamber of your Gene Cafe is <strong>made of Pyrex</strong> (heat-resistant tempered glass), and leaving the old oils to accumulate and burn will cause the the inside of the drum to turn black. The darker material will likely change your roasting time, and the fouled glass will not allow you to monitor your roasts. <strong>Glass does not need ""seasoning""</strong>, so it should be cleaned regularly per the manufacturer's recommendations.  </p>

<p><em>Seasoning</em> is typically a way to create a stick-resistant coating on a <em>porous</em> metal surface (like cast iron or carbon steel). When a thin layer of fat or oil is heated on these surfaces, it forms a polymer which provides rust protection and creates a non-stick surface that will keep whatever you are cooking/roasting from reacting with the cooking surface (the <em>juju</em> you mentioned above). </p>

<p>If the roasting chamber were made of cast iron or carbon steel, seasoning would be recommended. But neither glass nor stainless steel need seasoning, and you're just changing the built-in characteristics of your roaster. </p>

<p>To keep your roaster in optimal roasting condition, keep your glass roasting chamber clean.</p>

"Does pre-heating a puck on the group head produce more crema?","141","","<p>In my never-ending quest to get just a <em>little</em> more crema out of every shot, I've been experimenting with some advice I received from a barista - allow the puck to warm a bit in the porta filter on the group head prior to pre-infusing and pulling.</p>

<p>I have tried this, and I'm still skeptical - I don't really see a difference in the amount of crema that I get. I've tried a few different beans with this experiment:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.illy.com/wps/wcm/connect/en/coffee-at-home/coffee-for-espresso"">Illy</a> - Arabica, medium roast</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.lavazza.us/us/products/blends/qualita-oro/"">Lavazza Qualità Oro</a> - Also Arabica, medium / blonde roast</li>
</ul>

<p>While I do get a tad more pressure, I'm not getting any more crema than I usually do. His logic was pretty simple, pre-warming at around the 90 degrees Celsius that the head / portafilter tend to be results in more of the oils in the extraction, hence crema. </p>

<p>I've let it pre-heat for up to a few minutes with no real change in the pulled shot, with and without pre-infusing. </p>

<p>Is this an old wive's tale? Am I not letting it get hot enough or for long enough? Is Arabica just too gentle of a bean for this to work? The reason I'm trying to get more crema is for a few new deserts I'd like to make, the coffee is still delicious, I just hoped that the experiment would yield more.</p>

<p>Brewing using a Breville Barista Express (manual mode), if it makes any difference.</p>
","<p>Well, I've heard a lot of ""pro tips"" and advice having worked around espresso machines for a few years. And I must say, this one is new. I have never heard of warming the coffee itself. I can't imagine that, at the temperature at which the brew head usually resides, many significant changes are made in just a few moments of warming the coffee.</p>

<p>The closest I've heard to this is that some believe in the opposite. A fellow once told me to leave my spent puck in the portafilter if someone was going to be brewing again shortly. He claimed this helped retain heat in the portafilter. Though the science checks out, the results proved marginal and pretty much just made you the lazy guy using the espresso machine.</p>

<p>So, in closing, I'd say that the effects of warming your coffee are probably negligible, and that you can get more crema more easily through other means (buying better quality coffee, adjusting your brewing variables, etc)</p>

<p><em>I do understand i need to go more coarse to fix this...</em></p>
","<p>It's the pre-infusion feature of your machine in conjunction with the grind you were using. From <a href=""https://www.seattlecoffeegear.com/rocket-dual-boiler-r58-espresso-machine"" rel=""nofollow"">their site</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pre-Infusion: To extract the full flavor and aroma when you brew your espresso, the R58 has a dual pre-infusion system encompassing a working piston and static pre-infusion chamber.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most machines that have this feature understand that the pre-infusion is done based on the amount of water that has flowed, not how much time has passed (which is a good thing). So, if the puck is too dense, it can take quite a bit of time.</p>

<p>Adjusting grind a bit should fix it.</p>

"Which creates the strongest (and/or better quality) coffee? Espresso Maker vs. French Press","132","","<p>For a year I used an Espresso maker to make my morning cup of jo. Recently my maker broke and I decided to try out a french press. I originally though that the espresso maker would be stronger because it forced steam through the granules, but now am starting to lean towards a french press as long as I let it sit in the water for longer than around 5 minutes. I am basing everything on theories right now though, so I was wandering if anyone had any evidence supporting the facts on either side.</p>
","<p>It is hard to tell which one is better quality, it depends on your taste preferences, but in strength, french press wins. Actually any type of filter coffee (V60, aeropress, frenchpress), since espresso is brewed for about 30s, while filter takes about 3 minutes. 
I used to think that espresso is strong, because of the taste, but it is relatively weak compared to the filter coffee.</p>

"Do Automated Pour Over Machines provide the same flavor profile compared to manual pour over method?","130","","<p>I use 2 manual pourover methods</p>

<p>Method 1: Brown Melitta #4 paper filter rinsed using my Bonavaita drip machine's brew basket. 185F filtered water and beans grinded with Baratza Encore burr grinder</p>

<p>Beans from SquareOne, Intelligentsia, Novo</p>

<p>Method 2: using a Hario V60</p>

<p>Recently I've been noticing several automated pour over machines coming to the market - Poppy Pourover, Bodum, Invergo, Kitchenaid and lots of others getting on the automated pour over bandwagon.</p>

<p>Are these automated pourover machines even worth looking into?</p>
","<p>Several ""automatic pour-over"" machines have recently come onto the market from manufacturers such as those you listed.  They are something of a hybrid between the ubiquitous, conventional ""automatic drip"" machines and manual pour-over methods.  That is, the automatic pour-over machines attempt to perform the same sequence of steps recommended for manual pour-over, but in an automated fashion.</p>

<p>For example, compare the <a href=""https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/drip"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Blue Bottle pour-over drip guide</a>. This suggests a multi-step process of pouring. With water at a particular temperature, do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>heat the cone and wet the filter;</li>
<li>pour a small amount of water to wet the grounds and ""bloom"", then wait;</li>
<li>pour the rest of the water slowly in the middle of the grounds pile.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some other guides recommend pouring in circular motions, or in multiple iterations, or at a particular rate, or in certain places.  See also the question about <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/339/pouring-technique-for-drip-pour-over-coffee"">pour-over techniques</a>.</p>

<p>Regular auto-drip machines, on the other hand, simply drop water in one go over all of the grounds in a somewhat uncontrolled manner.  This also relates to a question: does auto-drip taste different than pour-over? That's a separate, open question.</p>

<p>This article from LifeHacker gives <a href=""http://lifehacker.com/automatic-pour-overs-do-they-make-a-better-cup-of-coff-1583005950"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a comparison between the new-fangled automatic pour-over machines and how they compare to real, manual pour-over</a>, and another from <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/16/ottomatic-chemex-coffee-brewer_n_6329320.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">HuffPo</a> about the Chemex model. Their conclusions are varied (see article for more) but:</p>

<ul>
<li>they're more expensive than conventional drip;</li>
<li>some models have controllable settings for certain parameters (e.g., bloom time; temperature)</li>
<li>they provide precise repeatability for certain parameters such as rate, contact time with grounds, water temperature.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ultimately, they provide attention to detail that can be done by hand; some do this better than others. However, most just heat water and drip it over the grounds somewhat better than a conventional drip coffee maker.</p>

<ul>
<li>don't want to learn the ""style"" or ""art"" to manual pour-over, or </li>

The coffee always tastes...different then what I believe it should taste like. What factors could attribute to having good iced coffee? </p>

<p>I brew it by using a standard coffee brewer (drip, i believe?) and then well, I ice it. </p>
","<p>Iced coffee, specifically drip brewed coffee poured over ice has a few things to consider with respect to taste. </p>

<ul>
<li>It has the acidity of regular coffee, often making it harsh(er) to drink, cold brewing can reduce this acidity by 70% but also potentially leave some of the flavor a behind in the coffee</li>
<li>It will be diluted since the ice will melt leaving you with a weaker tasting drink. Often this is compensated for by doubling the strength of the hot brew and letting the ice dilute to normal strength</li>
<li>Supposedly (although I've never tried it), the Japanese iced coffee method is a middle ground between iced and cold brewed coffees. In this method, hot coffee is brewed directly over ice instantly cooling it locking in the full flavor of hot coffee, but oxidizing much less. </li>
</ul>

","<p>Coffe is a natural product, and has a shelf life. The changes made to store the product for a longer period, makes the coffee deteriorate.</p>

<p>Coffee is at its best one week after roasting, and the shelf live is maximum 3-4 weeks after roasting. If the bag of coffee has a ‘best before’ or ‘use-by date’ rather than a ‘roast date’ it’s because whoever packaged the coffee would rather you didn’t know when it was roasted. </p>

","<p>Interesting question.
You are not alone when noticing flavor differences with different temperatures of coffee. When cupping coffee in a controlled lab situation for Quality Control purposes, I will often make multiple passes through the cups to taste the differences that are present as the coffee cools. Doing this tells me/us what we need to do while roasting to highlight/change the flavor profile of the roast.</p>

<p>The high acidity/brightness of a light roasted Kenya disappears as the cup cools. The darker roasted coffee that will show more ""sweetness"" at a high temp will show off more as it cools. These are but two examples. Other flavor characteristics that are found in roasted will definitely change as the coffee changes temp.</p>

<p>A lot of what you are tasting is perception. Here is a link to the key being how our taste buds translate it to our brain.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.foodnavigator.com/Science/Food-temperature-affects-taste-reveal-scientists"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Food temperature affects taste, reveal scientists</a></p>

<p>Once the coffee is roasted the only thing you can do to change the flavor profile of your coffee at high temperatures is changing the brewing method. All the variables in brewing will without a doubt change the flavors that you perceive.
This will lead you to experimentation to find the flavors that you want to see.</p>

"What Are The Merits of Different Green Coffee Processing Methods?","114","","<p>I've noticed that there's a distinct lack of Q&amp;A's on green coffee processing methods. As this is one of the earliest steps on the journey from seed to cup, I was curious:</p>

<p><strong>What are the merits of different green coffee processing methods?</strong> (i.e., impact on characteristics of coffee, labor, time, etc.)</p>

<p>In other words: Why does Farmer A prefer to use the dry process method while Farmer B favors the wet process?</p>

<p>Processing Methods:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dry Process</li>
<li>Wet Process</li>
<li>Semi-Dry Process/Pulped Natural</li>
</ul>
","<ul>
<li>Dry Process | This is the oldest method of modern processing.  It requires very little equipment.  It is basically a manual process of letting the coffee cherries raisin up, then peeling them.  It is a labor intensive process.  Dry processing tends to produce body heavy, smooth coffees with complex notes.  Dry processing is used extensively in Brazil and accounts for the distinct different flavor profiles from other South American coffees.  Dry processing is not practical in humid, wet, or temperate areas, as dry heat is necessary to dry the fruit in a short enough amount of time and to assure that mold or fungus does not set in.</li>
<li>Wet Process | This method start with running the cherries through machinery to remove the skin and outer layers of the fruit.  The beans with remaining inner layers of fruit are soaked in water and allowed to ferment.  Additional processing is done  to remove the final inner layers surrounding the bean.  The result is left to dry (usually with additional machine assistance).  Wet processing requires a comparatively large investment in equipment, access to enough water for the process and creates waste water that must also be dealt with.  The process does allow for multiple areas to sort beans (floating during fermentation, in channel after fruit strip, etc) that potentially allow for a more uniform product.  Wet processed coffees tend to be missing the overt fruit notes of a dry process, but this is debatable and can vary based on fermentation methods (additional additives are sometimes used in the fermenting process).  </li>
<li>Semi-Dry / Pulped Natural / Wet Hulled / Semi-Washed | This process is similar to the wet process except the fermentation step is skipped and specialized machines are used to strip the final layers from around the bean.  This method can produce beans with the best of both processing methods, but the machines used to strip the inner layers away are also prone to damaging beans.  This is a faster method of processing but again requires machine investment and resource use.  </li>
</ul>

<p>There are many other factors influencing coffee processing that should be kept in mind.  Individual farmers may not have a choice of processing method.  In many places the processing centers for coffee are quite separate from farms and only one processing center may be available.  Local conditions will also largely dictate what methods are appropriate or available.  There are also a myriad of variations on these methods that may produce different results and weather can play a factor as well (think about an area hit by a monsoon while large batches are trying to dry).  At some level, all farmers are trying to get paid for what they produce.  That being the case, most will prefer some combination of whatever local processing method is available and/or cheapest and produces the highest pricing for their product.  </p>

"What effect does portafilter diameter have on espresso?","113","","<p>It seems like a lot of the higher end espresso machines come with a 58mm portafilter.  Does this larger diameter have some improved effect on the resulting espresso?</p>
","<p>MT San talks about portafilters and the resulting differences between these portafilters that are different in size. </p>

<p>I will discuss the differences in espresso extraction as a result of portafilter and subsequent basket size.</p>

<p>Assuming that the only variable here is basket diameter:</p>

<p>Scientifically, pressure applied is normally measured as force per unit surface area. Taking the bed of coffee as a flat surface, and we assume traditional extraction pressure of 8 bar, the net extraction force upon the coffee puck will be greater for larger surfaces.</p>

<p>8 bar = 800kPa = 800 kN/m<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>Now given two different basket sizes 58mm and 52mm which are 0.058m and 0.052m respectively, the net force on the surface of bed of coffee will be:</p>

<p><strong>For 58mm:</strong></p>

<p>Surface area: πr<sup>2</sup> = π*0.029<sup>2</sup> = 0.00264207942</p>

<p>Net force on area: pressure x area = 800*0.00264 = 2.11 kN</p>

<p><strong>For 52mm:</strong></p>

<p>Surface area: πr<sup>2</sup> = π*0.026<sup>2</sup> = 0.00212371663</p>

<p>Net force on area: pressure x area = 800*0.00212 = 1.7 kN</p>

<p>We can see that the larger portafilter is subject to a higher force of extraction with the same pressure. What this amounts to in practice is very much dependent on your setup. However it should tend towards better consistency in extraction. This is because, for a given dose, more of the coffee is in contact with the water at the bed surface and so has a more direct pressure gradient through the puck as it will be comparatively thin in the larger basket helping to reduce probability of channeling.</p>

<p>However, observable effects in practice will be slight to none as many other variables will take precedence in affecting shot flavour and the difference in extraction force will be accounted for silently in your dial-in process.</p>

"Are the last drips after pulling an espresso less tasty?","112","","<p>Someone told me that the last drips coming out of a espresso machine after the pull is finished (when there is no water pressure any more) contain bad flavors. He recommended that I remove the coffee cup in the moment the machine stops producing pressure.</p>

<p>Is that true? If yes, why?</p>
","<p>It's not really the pressure, that's just timing.</p>

<p>It depends on the beans and roast; your comparison point is the first few (after pre-infusion) drips that came out. The last ones are always going to be weaker and quite possibly more acidic because the puck is both drained and saturated at the same time. It's drained of oils and flavors, and saturated with hot water. </p>

<p>Whether or not you can actually <em>detect</em> that difference should it be added to the rest of the shot is a matter of uncertainty, hinging on your sense of taste and the type of coffee used. If it's a dark-roasted robusta blend then you <em>might</em> be able to detect a slight almost 'metallic' or slightly salty flavor, but you'd need an extremely acute sense of taste.

","<p>If you could be more specific with your question it would be easier to answer.  For example was your previous ""pot"" a percolator or automatic coffee maker or what?  By the same token, what is your current set up?  By a process of elimination you should be able to isolate the factor that's causing your coffee to taste sh***ty.  Basically those are:</p>

<ol>
<li>The coffee itself - is it from the same source, being stored the same, same age, etc.</li>
<li>Same water - you said you'd tried different water sources.  Bottled water should yield good coffee.</li>
<li>The method of brewing, which would include water temperature, coarseness of grind, how long it extracts (steeps), cleanliness of the equipment, etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>If all the factors except the method of brewing are accounted for, then the problem is in the brewing method, which would include the coffee maker.  If you know it's clean and it still tastes bad, you need a different brewing method.  Depending on how much coffee you drink, there are lots of options that will yield good coffee.  I have found that the simpler methods (i.e., French press, AeroPress, pour over) are the easiest to control and therefore give you the best chance of getting a good result.  They are also cheaper and easier to keep clean.  Brewing good coffee is actually pretty straightforward so don't give up!</p>

"Is it possible to roast coffee in an industrial glass kiln?","107","","<p><strong>Could you roast coffee in an industrial glass kiln and it be drinkable?</strong></p>

<p>A strange question and purely hypothetical. This came about with a discussion with one of my friends who is a glass maker at university.</p>

<p>My first thoughts was that you could not control the temperature enough, however he did state that with glass making, the art is in how fast you can heat and cool down the kiln. So in effect, I don't think the temperature control would be an issue. I feel my issues are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Rotating of the coffee
during the roasting (as it would not be in a drum). It's possible to ""spin"" glass in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_casting_(mirrors)"" rel=""nofollow"">this
way</a>.</li>
<li>Post roast cooling, would there be a way you could make a makeshift
cooling bed that would be somewhat effective.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong><em>Drinkable</strong> - I guess this depends on personal taste, so for the sake of this exercise I will state that drinkable as the quality of instant coffee. So something you would drink to be polite but not find any pleasure in.</em></p>
","<p>If you can run the kiln at sufficiently <strong>low</strong> temperatures and have a solution for stirring the beans, yes you <em>could</em> roast coffee beans.</p>

<p>""Drinkable"" on the other hand is a hard to quantify term.</p>

<p>Ideally, you would roast the raw beans slowy until 200 - 230 C over a time window of 15 - 25 minutes, depending on desired darkness and roast type. 
This allows for a long and slow <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction"" rel=""nofollow"">Maillard reaction</a> and reduces the content of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorogenic_acid"" rel=""nofollow"">chlorogenic acid</a>.<br>
Your extremely hot kiln (""cold"" glass techniques use temperatures over 800C!) woud be even harsher than industrial roasters with their ""90 seconds at 400 C"" method. No time for a good Maillard reaction and reduction of chlorogenic acid.</p>

<p>So while you probably can roast (= darken) the beans in a kiln if you are really quick, the results would lack the aromatic profile desired in good quality roasts and the probability of having just a ""burnt and sour"" brew is extremely high.</p>

<p><strong>How can I achieve a bitter flavor with a French press?</strong></p>

<p>This is a real question as I am not sure if it is heat, steep time, or the coffee grounds that produce the bitterness.</p>
","<p>Bitterness comes from over-extracting the coffee. The factors affecting extraction are: water temperature, time, size of the grind, and to a lesser extent, agitation.</p>

<p>Using hotter water (above the usual 198F-202F), longer steep time, or a finer grind--or any combination of the three--will result in over-extraction, which will make the coffee more bitter. A darker roast will over-extract more easily as well, since an ideal extraction is typically 30-45 seconds shorter than a light roast.</p>

","<p>I do not believe such a product exists at a consumer level for dispensing coffee.</p>

<p>Hypothetically, you would need a vacuum-sealed container that also incorporates some sort of outlet corridor where the coffee could enter, which would then need to be sealed from the inside before dispensing the coffee. It would be like an ""air lock"" in a miniature coffee spacecraft. </p>

<p>But if this is simply a labor-saving effort, <strong>there <em>are</em> touchless, automatic vacuum-sealed containers</strong> that re-establish the vacuum every time you close it (search <a href=""https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=automatic+vacuum+container"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=automatic+vacuum+container</a>).</p>

<p>But on a broader note, if you find reestablishing the vacuum each time a bit more trouble than you would like, you might <strong>consider removing a few-days supply at a time,</strong> and just storing what you need in a regular air-tight container for your short-term daily use. Vacuum-sealing is optimal for longer-term storage, but I don't think you will find a <em>perceptible</em> loss of quality over a few days if you keep enough for your immediate needs in a regular air-tight container. </p>

<li>Two (or even three) times is quite correct during preparation. But boiling is quite wrong. Never boil Turkish coffee.</li>
<li>A well-prepared Turkish coffee is layered. So, the grounded coffee subside at the bottom of the ""fincan"" (cup). Ideally, it never gets mixed in the drinkable layer of the coffee. (Those remaining grounded coffee is for the fortunetellers.) I assume, by moving coffee in between the chambers of syphon three times, you cannot settle the grounded coffee easily. So, it will fill into your mouth. This is undesirable.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>there is no milk in it.</p>

<p>They don't say 'no sugar' in my town because it's probably assumed that we will add sugar separately anyway.</p>

<p>This happened again recently in a new coffee shop in the neighborhood, so I asked the employee why they always say like this -- and he had some free time and was kind enough to explain why:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Not every client knows what is an espresso or Americano. They may order it as a fresh experiment.

<p>I don't heed to their advice. But I do feel tense if I have coffee especially in excessive dose. However I am addicted to coffee.</p>

<p>Now why coffee is bad for me and how much caffeine per day is safe for me?</p>
","<p>Note:  I'm not a doctor, information below is based on the fact that I've done a lot of supplementation for working out, and have done a good amount of research into those supplements.  I would recommend following the advise of a doctor before anything I say, and fact check anything you read!</p>

<p>Caffeine is a vasoconstrictor.  In general, nervous tension / anxiety has a side effect/symptom/cause of high blood pressure.  Couple high blood pressure with a drug that makes your blood vessels more narrow, and you have even higher blood pressure.  While under normal circumstances, caffeine might slightly elevate blood pressure, if you are already in a situation where it is high, it may cause more serious issues.  In addition to this, caffeine does increase energy, makes you more jittery.. essentially increases tension!  So long story short, removing caffeine may reduce symptoms of your tension, and may also net you positive health benefits from removing it.</p>

<p>As for how to get off caffeine.  Personally, I do this whenever I start working out in the gym and treat caffeine consumption as a cycling supplement.  This basically retains the affects of the drug without your system becoming too used to it.  It isn't very easy, but typically I stop drinking coffee completely, and when I start to get a headache, I have a 'cheat' meal and a cup of coffee.  Cheat meal meaning something reasonably high in fat.  What I've found is when I get a headache, many times a heavy dose of fat / carbs / protein can correct it very quickly.  What you will find when doing this is that you are providing an optimal condition to recover from the caffeine headache, but your body will quickly become used to not having caffeine so the headaches will go away in about a week.  That week is no fun at all, but you have to step back and think.. it's only 7 days.   </p>

<p>Lastly, your ask about safe levels of caffeine.  This is basically impossible to determine based on the fact that 'safe levels' is entirely dependent on the individual.  Unfortunately, we probably need to refer you back to your doctor on this.  Ask questions of him!  Why no caffeine?  He may have a specific reason for it.  I won't go so far as to make a recommendation other than follow your doctors advice.</p>

<p>On the topic of <strong>different beans in a burr grinder:</strong> I find that my (admittedly <em>cheap</em>) burr grinder ""chokes"" on darker-roast beans. When I put dark roast beans into the grinder, the chute gets clogged with coffee grounds more quickly (as compared to lighter-roasted beans). I have a timer-based auto-shutoff model, and much less grounds come out when the grinder is ""clogged"" in this way. I attribute this clogging to the oil on the surface of the beans that is somehow ""sticky"" and more prevalent on darker roast beans, but I'm not certain. <a href=""http://coffeegeek.com/forums/coffee/questions/318466"" rel=""nofollow"">This article from Coffee Geek</a> talks about cleaning more frequently for darker roast beans, as does <a href=""https://www.seattlecoffeegear.com/learn/videos-home/ask-the-experts/burr-test-medium-dark-beans"" rel=""nofollow"">this review from Seattle Coffee Gear</a>, as does <a href=""http://www.coffeereview.com/coffee-reference/from-crop-to-cup/grinding/burr-grinders/"" rel=""nofollow"">this one from Coffee Review</a>. </p>

<p>On the topic of <strong>espresso pulled from these grounds:</strong> This is tricky and I'm really just speculating. Perhaps it's a similar situation: your darker-roast beans respond to tamping differently than your lighter-roast beans. If you're tamping hard and the grounds are clumping together somehow, you might be getting some channeling (resulting in uneven extraction); this could cause a more ""watery"" shot. You might be able to see evidence of this in the puck after you pull the shot, or you might be able to see it while pulling the shot if you use a naked (bottomless) portafilter. <a href=""https://www.home-barista.com/espresso-guide-diagnose-extraction-problems.html"" rel=""nofollow"">This article from Home-Barista</a> talks about a too-quick extraction being paired with grind flaws; are you seeing that?

"Is there a way to economically store freshly roasted coffee under vacuum?","98","","<p>I know that freshly roasted coffee needs to rest at least a few days before drinking because carbon dioxide is being released from the freshly roasted beans.  At the same time, excess exposure to oxygen will cause coffee to go stale quickly.  Commercial roasters have packaging machinery that sucks the air out of the bag and puts coffee beans under vacuum for storage.  The packages usually have a small vent hole to release carbon dioxide without allowing outside air into the bag.</p>

<p>My question is if there is a way to duplicate that storage idea without spending a lot of money on commercial packaging equipment?  I would like to be able to store my freshly roasted coffee without fear of it going stale too quickly.</p>
","<p>Yes, there is a way to store freshly roasted coffee - or even store bought roasted beans - at home under vacuum without expensive equipment.

One of these is a bottle stopper with a one-way valve in the top and a vacuum pump for removing the air from a partially consumed bottle of wine.  </p>

<p>My idea was to clean out the bottle and fill it with freshly roasted coffee beans, then use the vacuum pump and stopper to apply suction to the bottle to encourage the carbon dioxide to exit the beans without worrying about oxygen making the beans go stale prematurely.</p>

<p>I've found that the beans emit enough carbon dioxide gas to require re-pumping the bottle for the first day or two, but after that it will hold a vacuum indefinitely.  I've added erasable labels to the bottle to record the type of roasted beans I have inside.  Two standard wine bottles will hold about 610 grams of roasted beans, or about 700 grams of unroasted beans, which is 7 batches in my SR 500 roaster.  These are Ethiopian, YMMV.</p>

"Does drinking coffee immediately after lunch or dinner impact health?","95","","<p>Does drinking coffee immediately after breakfast or lunch or dinner impact health? </p>
","<p>It's a general question so in (general) order to make caffeine your friend &amp; not your enemy healthy-wise, the best time to drink coffee is upon awakening either from your sleep or nap if you take one. Coffee ""works"" after 20 min you may drink it but it remains to our system for 8-12 hours. Drinking coffee within 3-4 hours before sleep is not recommended as it may advance your sleep phase (you will go to sleep later, then you can wake later etc). So yes for breakfast, lunch but no for dinner. You can try decaffeinated sometimes, you may like it. </p>

"What happens to ground coffee if poured over with very warm instead of hot water?","90","","<p>I drink my coffee by putting ground coffee into a cup and pour it over with water that comes out of a heated Nespresso machine (I don't like to use capsules). However, I noticed that the water that comes out of this heated machine is not hot but rather very warm. </p>

<p>What are the effects of warm water (in comparison to very hot water) poured over ground coffee beans with regards to:</p>

<ul>
<li>taste &amp; flavours</li>
<li>health effects on the human body</li>
</ul>
","<p>Well first we should probably establish how cold the water is once it hits the ground. I imagine it is heated to almost boiling temperature in the Nespresso machine, however when it comes out and hits the cold cup it cools down almost immediately to probably 85 to 90°C or something around that.</p>

<p>In general colder water means basically that you are extracting less solid compounds of the coffee at a slower rate. So it is impossible really to draw any specific conclusions without knowing how hot the water is and how long the extraction takes.</p>

<p>However there are some general rules that always apply as the aforementioned slower extraction at lower temperatures. Another one is that with increasing contact time the extraction will be higher.</p>

<p>In terms of flavor lower extractions are generally associated with more acidic/sour coffee and the higher the extraction the more of the bitter compounds will be in your cup. An ideal extraction will be balanced with some fruity acidity and some darker, chocolaty flavors. Since you are using a full immersion technique it will not make that much of a difference though. I imagine you wait a few minutes before you start drinking the coffee? So there's probably a short moment where the extraction is balanced but the longer you sip on your cup the more bitter it gets which means overextraction. I think time is the more relevant variable in your case (if my estimate of the temperature is more or less correct)</p>

<p>Health wise I don't think it will make much of a difference either for the above mentioned reasons. Most of the caffein is extracted early on and by the end the extraction will be relatively high, regardless of the somewhat lower initial temperature. And since you are doing full immersion you will additionally always ingest a good amount of coffee grounds anyways.</p>

"Do ground beans or brewed coffee lose flavour faster?","89","","<p>I usually roast my coffee in the evening, grind it and brew it in the morning, to drink multiple hours later. I do notice that I do not have the same experience drinking coffee multiple hours after it has been brewed and kept in a thermos, despite me pouring it into a mug as usual. </p>

<p>I've been wondering recently if I should get a french press mug, which will keep the coffee grounds, and when I want to drink, I could add hot water to brew it on the spot. </p>

<p>I know, however, that ground coffee loses its flavour very quickly (I've heard people say that 15 minutes is enough for a tastable change in flavour). So this makes me wonder, is there a difference in how well flavour can be conserved in either ground coffee or brewed coffee? Does sealing either one in a thermos change this outcome?</p>
","<p>In the scenario given, you don't have the prefect solution to drink fresh coffee. However, I would opt for carrying a brewing solution (French-press in your case) with me. Let's discuss the two cases separately.</p>

<p><strong>1. Early-brewing</strong></p>

<p>In that case, you can grind fresh beans and prepare your coffee optimally with the brewing method of your preference. However, you cannot protect the brewed cup of coffee to go 'bad'. The reason is, whatever you do, you leave tiny coffee grounds in the water and they continue the extraction process. By time, your coffee gets bitter as a result of over-extraction.</p>

<p>Actually, this is a problem even in our daily routine. Pour-over brewing methods are invented for that. We mostly use paper filters to filter out most of the tiny grounds and have a clean cup to get rid of continuing extraction. Thus, we can have a stable cup while we drink in the next five minutes.</p>

<p>If you follow your taste buds, you can clearly feel this in a Turkish coffee cup or French-press, as most of the tiny grounds are still in the final cup in a French-press (and all of them are still there in a Turkish fincan) you should be quick to drink it. Otherwise, the cup goes crap. (By the way, inverted French-press is can also be used to minimize the effect of tiny grounds. But not effective enough.)</p>

<p><strong>2. Late-brewing</strong></p>

<p>Everybody on this board could admit that after grinding coffee goes stale in a few minutes. (See <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/3715/how-quickly-does-coffee-get-stale"">How quickly does coffee get stale?</a>)</p>

<p>When you grind the beans, the surface area increases so the delicious aromatics evaporate more easily. You probably will end up with a duller coffee experience at the end. However, I feel like over-extraction is a far worse problem in your case.</p>

"Wet grind with cold water to maximize yield?","89","","<p>I usually make drip coffee with a coffee maker, and the grinds go in pretty dry. I use 4 cups of water, but I usually only get around 2.5 cups of actual coffee out of it. I think that those 1.5 cups of water are partially evaporated, and partially absorbed by the grind. I have a theory that if I wet the grinds with cold water, they would saturate the grind but not absorb the flavor, and I could increase my coffee yields without diluting it. Is this a valid idea, or would I just end of creating diluted coffee? Thanks.</p>
","<p>Given that I commonly cold brew overnight, I find the idea that cold water would not absorb the flavor somewhat far-fetched. I also find your absorbtion crazy-high unless you are using a huge mount of ground coffee to yield 2.5 cups liquid. I've been french-pressing for months now, but I doubt I lost a cup in making 12 cups (about 8 measuring cups) when I was using my drip machine.</p>

<p>What it <em>would</em> do is to alter (favorably or unfavorably, only you can say, after you try it) the effective temperature of the extraction by supplying some cold water as well as the hot water (and if you are boiling off any significant amount of the 4 cups you start with, it's almost certainly too hot.)</p>

<p>As far as the practicality concerns go, it may be more of a pain than it's worth.  The coffee containing part of the filter funnel is going to be pretty well attached, in order to keep it from slipping into the cup below and steeping (like tea) vs. simply having the water run through it.

<blockquote>
  <p>The subtropical regions, at high altitudes of 16-24° (Illy, 21). 
  Rainy and dry seasons must be well defined, and altitude must be
  between 1800-3600 feet.  These conditions result in one coffee growing
  season and one maturation season, usually in the coldest part of
  autumn.  Mexico, Jamaica, the S. Paulo and Minas Gerais regions in
  Brazil, and Zimbabwe are examples of areas with these climate
  conditions (Illy, 21).</p>
  
  <p>The equatorial regions at latitudes lower than 10° and altitudes of
  3600-6300 feet (Illy, 21).  Frequent rainfall causes almost continuous
  flowering, which results in two coffee harvesting seasons.  The period
  of highest rainfall determines the main harvesting period, while the
  period of least rainfall determines the second harvest season. Because
  rainfall is too frequent for patio drying to occur,  artificial drying
  with mechanical dryers is performed in this type of coffee growing
  environment. Examples of countries that have this climate are Kenya,

However, just because a coffee is not fair trade doesn't mean that it isn't fair, and there are some coffee plantations that I've heard of that do better than the fair trade standard but don't go for the official certification.</p>

<p>Are there any brands that are:</p>

<p>a. cheaper than fair trade
b. as ethical/better from both a human and environment standard?</p>
","<p>The major standards are a bit confusing honestly.  Fair trade provides a baseline above the commodities rates, but they don't ensure that the farmer is getting the most for their product.  Furthermore, the farm has to be able to be certified for conforming to certain environmental conditions prior to being certified.  Many coffee farmers are so far off the beaten path that they simply cannot afford to be certified.  I believe that conscientious importers provide a far better compensation to the farmer.  </p>

<p>It looks like Fair Trade assures something between 15 and 35 cents above commodities rates.  This is far below what a roaster will pay for specialty grade coffee.  While fair trade is a good baseline, if you purchase specialty coffee, you are most likely buying coffee that was purchased for significantly better than fair trade rates.  To give you an idea.. I pulled up a random invoice I had in my inbox and it was $1.70 above commodities rate.  Furthermore, importers provide on the ground support to farmers in the form of varietal education and recommendations, disease prevention, washing technique improvements, all of which net the farmer tangible benefits because their coffee will improve in quality, and thus, sell for more.</p>

<p>So.. if you are looking for good ethical compensation for farmers, I would say look for local specialty roasteries.  These roasteries are purchasing high quality coffee from a high quality importer which means that there are people on the ground helping farmers achieve better quality, and thus better compensation.</p>

<p>The link below is a pretty interesting article from a greens buyer I am thinking about working with.  I found it a very interesting read that gave some insight into what importers actually do, and highlights why a lot of coffee farms are not certified.. </p>

If the water is heated above the intended temperature it will cause acidic compounds to be extracted from the beans. After a while the temperature is stabilized and you will experience that the coffee is no longer acidic. </p>

<p>How do you make mild agglomerated coffee?</p>
","<p>Making instant coffee is the same process as making a cup of coffee from grinding your own beans - at least the first part of it before the drying.</p>

<p><a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/411/how-is-instant-coffee-made"">How is instant coffee made</a></p>

<p>So if I want a mild cup of coffee, I use less coffee grind. There are other variables that can be played with along with the amount of grind: extraction time, extraction temperature, bean roast level.</p>

<p>You can probably make your cup of instant less mild by adding an extra spoon or so of instant. Simulating (?) more coffee grind.</p>

","<p>The short answer is no.  Short of genetic testing, it is near impossible to determine the origin of beans.  </p>

<p>You may be able to make an educated guess at the whether or not Robusta beans are in the blend based the shapes of the beans and caffeine content.  But that would require a trained eye as as there is a great amount of variation in beans and it might be possible to mix up robusta, natural peaberrys, etc.  Robusta will raise the caffeine content, but depending on the blended amount, it may be hard to detect.</p>

"Why do some coffee beans produce more dust than others when ground?","61","","<p>I've noticed that at the same grind setting (medium grind), some coffee beans produce a ton of dust when ground, while others barely have any dust. I'm thinking it has to do with the roast level, but I'm not completely sure.</p>

<p>What factors affect how much dust is produced when grinding coffee beans?</p>
","<p>In addition to the factors mentioned by Jerry101 you are very right in assuming that it has to do with the roast level. The grinder is of course to most important variable here but I'm assuming you are using the same grinder for all your roasts or rather you are comparing results of different beans using the same grinder.</p>

<p>The temperature has an effect, cooler beans create a smaller and more evenly distributed grind (on the same settings). Everyone who has ever worked as a barista knows this. During the day in a commercial setting the grinder will heat up resulting in a change in grind size. That is why you should check your extraction on regular intervals, when working in a café. See also the study linked by Jerry101 and <a href=""https://baristahustle.com/blogs/barista-hustle/the-grinder-paper-explained"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> article on Barista Hustle.</p>

<p>However in my opinion and experience the most important factor in every day situations is indeed the roast level. Just try to squish beans of the same origin but different roast colors (any specialty coffee shop will likely have either Ethiopian, Kenyan, Colombian or ... beans in an espresso blend and as a filter roast) between your fingers and you will notice that the darker beans will crush more easily. They are much more brittle, because they have less water left in them and thus break creating more dust/fines. If you were to freeze your beans (which you should do very carefully, in a sealed and vacuumed package) the temperature would likely be as important or maybe more important than different roast levels.</p>

<p>The bean type (origin) has likely no or only a very small effect on the grind. This is discussed in both sources linked to.</p>

","<p>I have no specific experience with this cold brew device but a general understanding of how extraction works and experience with other devices. In short, you can definitely use water at room temperature to make cold brew (I think it is better), but there seem to be some specific issues with this cold brew maker.</p>

<p>In general the colder the water, the slower it will extract the solid compounds from the coffee. This is the main thing you have to keep in mind, because you will have to adjust some other variables in order to reach the right extraction. In their instructions they suggest you use a medium grind level. This is one variable you could change. Instead of a medium grind level I would use a medium to coarse grind. Another variable that you could change is the brew time. They set the device to 1 drop per second but you could increase that a little to speed up the brewing process, resulting in less extraction.</p>

<p>Specifically with this device there seems to be the problem, that air bubbles block the valve (see the FAQ on the website). They argue that the changing water temperature is responsible for the bubbles to appear. However if you brew at room temperature the water temperature should be much more consistent than with ice water which will obviously melt eventually and then the water will warm up. So I'm not quite sure about their logic (unless you are supposed to add ice until the brewing is over).</p>

<p>I suggest you go ahead and try it at room temperature, adjusting the other variables. Make sure you pre infuse properly so the grounds degas as much as possible, that should prevent too much gas blocking the valve. Alternatively you could use refrigerated water and brew it in the fridge.
Hope this helps, in the end it's a lot of trial and error anyways. Have fun brewing.</p>

Maybe in some manuals it's written that you shouldn't let it run empty on very fine settings, but that's more to avoid warranty claims than because it would actually hurt your grinder and I assume they are referring to letting it run for minutes on end, which you probably shouldn't do. And why would you? The burrs in any case shouldn't touch each other at all, even on fine settings (or only at the flat part of the burrs, but certainly not the blades). I have yet to seen a grinder that was getting damaged due to the few seconds of running empty after your dose went through.</p>

"How should I vary my steaming technique to create the correct ratios of steamed to foamed milk for the drink I wish to create?","48","","<p>When steaming (semi-skimmed) milk with the steam wand on my Espresso Machine I tend to end up with quite an even texture throughout. I always steam the milk until it reaches the 'steam zone' on my thermometer which is between 65 and 70 degrees Celsius. My technique for steaming the milk is to 'skim' the steam nozzle on the top of the milk so as not to create huge bubbles.</p>

<p>However, I only have this one technique for steaming milk, therefore I can't distinguish between say a cappuccino, flat white, or latte - which each require varying amounts of steamed and foamed milk.</p>
","<p>You're on the right track for good foam by keeping the tip of the wand close to the surface. To end up with less foam, submerge the tip as the temperature rises and the hiss drops to a whisper; I usually dip down after the first 15 or 20 seconds or so for a latte, longer for a cappuccino.</p>

<p>When you hear milk ""screaming"" in coffee places, that's the sound of a submerged wand in cold milk. The result is milk that tastes flat and has little or no foam. As long as you keep the wand near the surface until the milk warms up and quiets, you can experiment with time and depth until you're getting the results you want.</p>

","<p>I have this exact brewer. This may seem counterintuitive, but I would suggest removing the lid from the carafe before pouring. The lid has a narrow rectangular notch through which the coffee passes during pour, and it is the shape of the notch that causes the splash.</p>

<p>Bunn has actually had a couple of versions of the BTX-BT carafe, and the current design is focused on maximum thermal retention. Unfortunately, the trade-off is difficult pour control.</p>
